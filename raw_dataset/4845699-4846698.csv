https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845701,US House passes Taiwan Assurance Implementation Act,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday (March 22) passed a bill that would require the State Department to carry out periodic reviews of its guidelines for American engagement with Taiwan no less than every two years.
The Taiwan Assurance Implementation Act passed with an overwhelming 404-7 vote, according to CNA. The bill was introduced on Feb. 24 by Representative Ann Wagner and amends the Taiwan Assurance Act of 2020.
In a statement announcing the measure, Wagner said the regular reviews and updates must explain how the guidance deepens and expands relations between the U.S. and Taiwan. State Department updates would also be required to “give due consideration to the fact that Taiwan is a democratic partner and a free and open society that respects universal human rights and democratic values.”
In addition, updates need to “ensure that the conduct of relations with Taiwan reflects the longstanding, comprehensive, and values-based relationship the United States shares with Taiwan, and contribute to the peaceful resolution of cross-Strait issues.” And lastly, reviews must “identify opportunities to lift any remaining self-imposed limitations on U.S.-Taiwan engagement and articulate a plan to do so.”










Wagner noted that for decades most senior American executive branch officials were banned from visiting Taiwan in order not to anger China, while top Taiwanese officials were not able to travel to the U.S. Meanwhile, meetings between officials from the two countries had to comply with a long list of cumbersome and arbitrary rules, such as having meetings in hotels instead of official federal buildings, Wagner said.
In January 2021, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said all of those guidelines were null and void. However, many of these restrictions have since been put back in place by the Biden administration, Wagner said.
Wagner also added that Taiwan is now facing an “unprecedented threat” from China and that the U.S. needs to stand by its friends and partners, particularly Taiwan. “We must increase our economic ties, defense relationship, and political support of Taiwan’s democratic system, and this bill will support these goals.”
The only opposition to the House bill came from seven Democrats; Jamaal Bowman, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley, and Delia Ramirez, according to The Hill. The bill will now need to be passed in the Senate before it can be sent to President Joe Biden’s desk to be signed into law, not signed, or vetoed.TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday (March 22) passed a bill that would require the State Department to carry out periodic reviews of its guidelines for American engagement with Taiwan no less than every two years.The Taiwan Assurance Implementation Act passed with an overwhelming 404-7 vote, according to CNA.

The study examines the market’s current and future developments.Cloud Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) are essential elements of cloud-based infrastructure security. These devices act as physical barriers between sensitive data and the outside world, ensuring only authorized personnel has access to this information. In simpler terms, HSMs act as cryptographic processors which store and manage key encryption keys.Request for a sample report here: https://market.biz/report/global-cloud-hardware-security-modules-hsm-market-qy/718285/#requestforsampleAs more businesses migrate to cloud computing, the market for Cloud Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) is expanding rapidly. HSMs are physical devices that protect sensitive data and cryptographic keys in the cloud, offering companies an extra layer of protection when storing confidential information online.Cyber attacks on cloud infrastructure are one of the major drivers behind this growth. HSMs add security to the cloud by protecting encryption keys and preventing unauthorized access to sensitive information. HSM solutions have become increasingly sought-after due to regulatory compliance requirements like GDPR or HIPAA.There are a few reasons why the market growth for Cloud Hardware Security Modules has slowed. Potential customers lack awareness of how important and beneficial HSMs can be to cloud security, which is one major cause. Furthermore, many businesses lack understanding about how HSMs function or how they can benefit their operations.Thales

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845778,Taiwan's Namaxia firefly season starts late this year,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — After being delayed for a week, the firefly season at Kaohsiung’s Namaxia began on Friday (March 24).According to Namaxia District Office, this year, the fireflies’ maturity was impeded by the drought in south Taiwan as well as the series of cold snaps. The cold weather in mountainous areas slowed down the speed of fireflies’ growth, while the drought left the soil dry, making it difficult for larvae to build pupa cells.Thanks to the past week’s good weather and heat, however, fireflies in Namaxia finally emerged from the earth. District Director Avia Kanpanena (孔賢傑) was cited as saying, “Tens of thousands of fireflies are dancing about, it is very beautiful.”The “Namasia Firefly Tour” runs from Friday to April 30. Visitors may observe fireflies while walking on three trails between 6 and 9 p.m. The Dakanuwa trail, which is suitable for all visitors, is open seven days a week and has a length of 1,288 meters and a capacity of 400 people.The advanced Labiniya and Nanshalu trails are open every Saturday. The Labiniya trail has a length of 746 m and a capacity of 100, while the Nanshalu trail has a length of 934 m and a capacity of 300.On weekdays, tickets to the event go on sale at 3 p.m. at Namaxia’s only gas station. On weekends, tickets go on sale at 2 p.m. at the Nanshalu village’s former Farmers’ Association, Maya village’s Mango Tree Village Market, and the Una Bread and Breakfast, in addition to the gas station.After 6 p.m., tickets are sold at trailheads. Each ticket is priced at $250.",2023/03/24,1028,Travel & Cuisine

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845796,"Amid massive demonstrations, Macron delays Charles' visit","PARIS (AP) — Ongoing unrest across France and calls for a new round of demonstrations against President Emmanuel Macron's pension plan persuaded officials to postpone a planned state visit next week by Britain's King Charles III.While a clear disappointment to the royal palace, the decision is also a bad sign for Macron. The 45-year-old leader is increasingly detested by protesters and contested in parliament, and seen as oblivious to France's souring mood as he sticks to his positions. And that's now hurting his global image, too.Charles had been scheduled to arrive in France on Sunday to celebrate France and Britain's renewed friendship. But the protests and strikes against Macron's decision to raise France's retirement age from 62 to 64 promised to impact his visit, with some workers refusing to roll out the red carpet for the king's arrival.Violence soared during Thursday’s ninth union-organized nationwide marches. Over 450 protesters were arrested in Paris and beyond, and hundreds of police and demonstrators were injured, as gatherings nationwide drew more than a million people.There were scattered protest actions on Friday. Train traffic was slowed, rows of trucks blocked access to Marseille’s port for several hours and debris littered the streets of Paris.Macron has made the proposed pension changes the priority of his second term, arguing they are needed to keep the pension system from diving into deficit as France, like many richer nations, faces lower birth rates and longer life expectancy.Anger over the plan has increasingly turned into broader opposition to Macron’s leadership. His insistence this week that the retirement measure be implemented by the end of the year prompted critics to describe him as “self-satisfied” and “out of touch.''During his first term, Macron’s government made other changes it said would make France’s labor market more flexible and revitalize the economy. Those included making it easier to hire and fire workers, cutting business taxes, and making it more difficult for the unemployed to claim benefits.Critics argue the changes fray a social safety net seen as central to France's way of life.Countries across Europe have been raising pension ages. Retirement rules vary widely from country to country, making direct comparisons difficult. The official retirement age in the U.S. is now 67.Macron's plan involves multiple adjustments to France's complex pension system. It would also require French people to work 43 years to earn a full pension, or wait until they turn 67, as the law now calls for. Opponents have proposed other solutions, including higher taxes on the wealthy or companies.The government refused to consider those, however, and forced the bill through parliament last week, using a constitutional power, and the text is now being reviewed by France’s Constitutional Council. The forced passage further angered Macron's critics.Macron condemned the violent behavior at some protests, saying “violence has no place in a democracy.”He said “common sense and friendship” required delaying King Charles’ visit, adding that it likely would have become a protest target, creating a “detestable situation.”It wouldn't be reasonable “to hold a state visit in the middle of protests,” the French leader told a news conference after a summit in Brussels. He said he took the initiative to call Charles on Friday morning, and that the visit likely would be rescheduled for the summer.Charles and Queen Consort Camilla planned to visit both France and Germany during the king’s first trip abroad as Britain’s monarch. He still plans to go to Germany.Charles had been scheduled to visit the city of Bordeaux on Tuesday, coinciding with the tenth round of nationwide strikes and protests. The heavy wooden door of the elegant Bordeaux City Hall was destroyed by fire Thursday night by people taking part in an unauthorized demonstration.Bordeaux wine industry officials expressed regret that Charles would not visit next week, but were glad the visit would still happen.“We are of course disappointed Charles won’t come now but we clearly understand why,” said Cecile Ha of the Bordeaux Wine Council. “We are looking forward to welcoming him at the end of summer, which is great time for the vineyards as they are very lively at this time of year before the harvests.”French authorities have blamed radicals for the protest destruction. But Europe's main human rights body, the Council of Europe, the International Federation of Human Rights (FIDH), and media watchdog Reporters Without Borders also raised concern Friday about violence by police against what has been a largely peaceful movement.Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said Friday that investigations are under way into 11 complaints of excessive violence by police this week.He added that 1,000 trash bins were set on fire in the French capital; overflowing garbage cans have become a symbol of the protests during a weeks-long strike by sanitation workers.Fires in Paris that were intentionally lit in narrow or inaccessible alleys on Thursday night alarmed both city officials and residents. Firefighters and residents worked to tame the flames that rose to the second story of an apartment building in the chic Palais Royal area.Oil refineries have been another target. On Friday, emboldened protesters blockaded the Fos-sur-mer oil depot near Marseille to stop trucks from entering and leaving. However, fuel supplies to Paris from the large Gonfreville-L’Orcher refinery in Normandy resumed after police intervened.Fearing disruptions in coming days, France’s Civil Aviation Authority requested the cancellation of one-third of flights at Paris’ second airport, Orly, on Sunday, and 20% on Monday.—-Danica Kirka in London and Samuel Petrequin in Brussels contributed to this report.",2023/03/25,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845797,1500 evacuated as Spain's fire season starts early,"MADRID (AP) — More than 1,500 people were evacuated as a major forest fire raged in Spain’s eastern Castellon province on Friday, marking an early start to the nation's fire season amid bone dry conditions.Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez promised full support to those who had fled their homes.“We’re looking at the first major fire, unfortunately, this year,"" he said. “And it is also taking place out of season.”Local officials said the fire had engulfed around 3,000 hectares of land since it broke out on Thursday, forcing residents into shelters operated by the Red Cross and other charities. Its cause was not immediately clear.Ximo Puig, the president of the Valencia region that incorporates Castellon, told reporters the fire was “very early in the spring, very voracious from the beginning.”Puig added that the effects of climate change “are undeniable, so the perspective of firefighting must be considered on an annual basis.”Emergency services in the region said eight villages had been evacuated, as well as a home for older people in Montan.As of Friday afternoon, 18 water-dropping planes and helicopters and more than 500 firefighters and soldiers were tackling the fire. The Spanish military and the nation's ecological transition ministry deployed additional support to try to bring the blaze under control.The state weather agency, AEMET, tweeted that “unfavorable weather conditions, especially considering the early date of the year, have favored the (fire's) rapid spread."" Temperatures were above 25 Celsius (77 Fahrenheit) when the fire broke out, and relative humidity sank below 30% following an unusually dry winter in the area.The risk of more fires in Castellon was classified as “extreme"" on Friday.Miguel Sandalinas, the mayor of one of the villages affected, said that fallen trees left over from winter and the general lack of care for dried vegetation had given the fire “a lot of ammunition.”In 2022, wildfires burned through 306,555 hectares of land in Spain, an area almost four times the size of New York City, according to European Union data. Last year was also Spain's hottest since records began.Despite extensive planning, early warning surveillance and prediction models, preparing for wildfires remains a huge challenge.Spain officially entered a period of long-term drought at the end of last year, owing to high temperatures and low rainfall over the past three years.Spain has warmed 1.3 degrees Celsius (2 degrees Fahrenheit) since the 1960s, a warming that is noticeable all year round but especially in summer, when average temperatures have risen by 1.6 degrees.",2023/03/25,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845798,UCLA's Kiki Rice AP Diary: On to the Sweet 16!,"GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) — What a fun atmosphere that was!Playing in my first NCAA Tournament was a blast and to get to play the first two rounds at home was special. The crowd was incredible and that was one of the best environments we’ve had all season.I admit I was a little nervous before the first game. In the back of my head and that of my teammates, you always know that it could be the last game of the season. I wanted to go out there and play as hard as I could and make sure that didn’t happen.Getting a basket early calmed me down a little bit and having a good start to the first quarter really helped too.It also always calms me down a bit that we had our pregame dance party. It keeps us loose and we have fun. It’s one of my favorite things about this team.Whatever is on DJ Brynn (Masikewich’s) play list is what we dance to. She’ll always put on good tunes for us to get us in the right mindset.While the first game went really well, that second game was something. We knew Oklahoma was a good team and even though we were up big early, we knew they weren’t going to quit. They sure didn’t.Fortunately Charisma (Osborne) had an incredible last home game with 36 points. It was so great for her and the other seniors to win their final game at Pauley.I love being in close games. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t want to lose, but as a competitor it’s more exciting to play in a game that comes down to the end then one when you win by 30.Now with two wins down, we’re on to South Carolina!We’re excited for the challenge of playing the Gamecocks. They are undefeated this year and the overall No. 1 seed and we won’t take them lightly. A lot of people don’t think we can do it, but we have a ton of confidence in ourselves. It’s a business trip and definitely not going to be easy at all and we’re looking forward to the challenge.We played them early in the season and we didn’t win, but it was a close game in the fourth quarter and we were right there. We both have gotten a lot better since that game.We’ve gone on trips before and on the long plane rides, people sleep and watch movies. We also have an hour-long study hall. That’s important, especially this time of year. We’re still in finals right now and I have a couple due before Friday. My plan is to get them done before the trip so that I don’t have to be thinking about the work on the plane.I try to be a planner and get ahead of things and not wait until the last minute,A couple quick shoutouts before we get on this plane: Thanks to the NCAA for the cool swag. They gave us some cool gear with the shorts, top, jacket and bucket hat. Also some socks, too. I heard we’ll get more stuff in Greenville.Also thanks to Professor Lang, my English teacher. He surprised me by having my No. 1 jersey that he bought from the bookstore. They don’t sell them with names on them, but he went out and put my name on the back of it. It was really cool to sign it for him. It’s so great that he and my classmates support us.Time to go to work in South Carolina.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845799,Unwelcome spotlight falls on NHL team Pride night events,"Pride nights, held annually for several years by National Hockey League teams to show support for the LGBTQ+ community, are in the spotlight following several high-profile incidents this season.A handful of players have objected to participating in pregame warmups that included Pride-themed jerseys, most recently Florida's Eric and Marc Staal on Thursday night. On Wednesday, the Chicago Blackhawks decided against having players wear Pride-themed warmup jerseys for their upcoming Pride night, citing an anti-gay law in Russia.WHAT ARE THE OBJECTIONS?The Staal brothers and San Jose's James Reimer — who are Canadian — and Philadelphia's Ivan Provorov, who is Russian, all pointed to their religious beliefs for refusing to take part in warmups.“We carry no judgement on how people choose to live their lives, and believe that all people should be welcome in all aspects of the game of hockey,” Eric and Marc Staal said in a statement. “Having said that, we feel that by us wearing a Pride jersey, it goes against our Christian beliefs.”The Blackhawks said they acted out of concern that the safety of their Russian player and two others with connections to Russia could be jeopardized by the law when they return home because it expands restrictions on supporting LGBTQ+ rights.Chicago coach Luke Richardson said he and his players were disappointed.“It's an unfortunate situation,” Richardson said. “I don’t think we can control the world issues, so that takes it out of our hands.”The New York Rangers and Minnesota Wild decided not wear Pride-themed jerseys during warmups after advertising that they would. While each team has at least one star Russian player on its roster, neither specified the reason for the change.IS THIS RELATED TO RUSSIA'S WAR IN UKRAINE?Somewhat. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the anti-gay law signed by President Vladimir Putin in December have combined to pose some problems for the NHL and its 32 teams.No North American professional sports league has as many Russian players as the NHL. The Russian contingent includes some of the league's best athletes.There are currently 45 Russia-born players spread across 28 teams, or about 6.4% of all players. They include No. 2 career goal-scorer Alex Ovechkin of the Washington Capitals, Tampa Bay’s two-time Stanley Cup-winning goaltender Andrei Vasilevskiy, Lightning teammate and 2019 MVP Nikita Kucherov and reigning Vezina Trophy winner Igor Shesterkin of the New York Rangers.The top five highest-earning Russian players receive an average annual salary of $11.1 million this season. Sergei Bobrovsky, a two-time Vezina Trophy-winning goaltender who is making $12 million, participated in Florida's warmup in a Pride-themed jersey.Russian players almost never discuss the war, in part out of concern for the safety of their loved ones at home. It was not clear if there was any credible threat behind the Blackhawks’ decision.WHAT’S THE NHL’S HISTORY WITH PRIDE?The Stanley Cup first appeared at a Pride parade in 2010 when then-Blackhawks defenseman Brent Sopel brought it to the celebration in Chicago. A few years later, in 2013, the league partnered with the You Can Play Project, which advocates for LGBTQ+ participation in sports. The NHL added team Pride ambassadors in 2016-17.Rainbow Pride stick tape debuted with the Edmonton Oilers in 2016. Now all 32 teams hold a Pride night, though many do so without themed jerseys. The Boston Bruins and Columbus Blue Jackets call theirs “Hockey Is For Everyone"" night.Pride nights, like other themed events, are planned and staged by individual teams, not the NHL.WHAT HAS BEEN THE REACTION?The You Can Play Project responded to Reimer's decision by saying it was disappointed.“Religion and respect are not in conflict with each other, and we are certainly disappointed when religion is used as a reason to not support our community,” the organization said.Nashville Predators prospect Luke Prokop, who in 2021 made history as the first player signed to an NHL contract to come out as gay, called the Pride night incidents a “step back” for hockey.WHAT DID LEAGUE OFFICIALS SAY?NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman, defending teams' handling of the situation, said the boycotts were not about accepting bigotry.“Whether or not you choose to embrace and make a statement on behalf of a cause affirmatively, if you choose not to do that, it doesn’t necessarily make you a bigot,” Bettman said last month. “I’m sure you don’t endorse every single charity that solicits you, and you don’t participate in every social cause. You pick and choose the ones that are important to you.""The league declined to comment on the Blackhawks’ decision.WHAT'S NEXT?Teams with Pride nights coming up have some decisions to make. The Buffalo Sabres are set to host their event on Monday, and the Vancouver Canucks on March 31. Each team has at least one Russian player.It was not clear if players would wear Pride jerseys in warmups, as the teams have done in the past.___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/25,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845800,Taiwanese 'Hello Kitty' English-Chinese dictionary has 70 'egregious errors',"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — An American, long-term resident of Taiwan discovered late last year that a children's ""Hello Kitty"" English-to-Chinese dictionary has over 70 ""egregious errors.""Despite efforts to alert the company of the mistakes, the book is still on sale.The 46-year-old writer and podcaster Eryk Smith, who lives in Kaohsiung, told Taiwan News he was working last fall with an elderly student who wanted to refresh his English. The student showed him a copy of an English-to-Chinese dictionary that he wanted help with.The dictionary, titled ""Children's Illustrated Dictionary"" (Hello Kitty 兒童英漢辭典) is printed by ACME Cultural Enterprise Co. (世一文化事業股份有限公司) and is the most recent edition, printed in June 2020.Smith noticed mistakes in the dictionary, including typos, parts of speech, and example sentences. For instance, the entry for ""rice"" was spelled ""rest.""The word ""imagine"" was listed as a verb but has the letter ""n"" for noun in English. The example sentence for ""birthday"" read ""Happy birghday.""Under the ""Revision Editor"" notes in the front of the book, the word ""Language"" is misspelled as ""Languagc."" Smith observed that there are dated usages not appropriate for children, such as references to smoking.Smith said that after reading through the dictionary twice, he found over 60 ""egregious errors."" In October last year, he contacted the publisher and notified them of the typos.He said he was initially offered a refund for the NT$320 (US$10.50) cost of the dictionary that his student's secretary bought from Kinokuniya. Smith was not satisfied with this response.Instead, he advised the company to recall the dictionaries because it's ""not just embarrassing for you, but for Taiwan in general, and also for Taiwan's education system."" He added that it ""flies in the face of the government's Bilingual 2030 campaign.""Company representatives said they would get back to him in a week or so, but failed to do so. In January, he shared his findings with Johanne Murray, who is a lecturer in the Department of English at Wenzao Ursuline University of Languages and PhD candidate of business management at National Sun Yat-sen University.Murray told Taiwan News that she was shocked at what she described as a ""poor product that doesn't deserve to represent the Made-in-Taiwan brand."" She compiled a 47-page PDF annotating many of the more blatant errors, discovering another 10 mistakes in the process, bringing the total number of typos in the dictionary to at least 70.In January, Murray sent the PDF to two local educators and an official at the Ministry of Education (MOE). However, over two months later, she has yet to receive a response from any of these individuals.Murray said of the error-ridden book: ""It shows a lack of concern for consumers, their brand name, and their partner Sanrio.""She added that as a parent she would be really upset if she discovered her child was exposed to such content, and as a teacher, she would not want to give it out to her students.Smith informed a government official who contacted the company about the matter. A company representative sent a response via the social media app LINE acknowledging that there had been errors in the dictionary.Furthermore, it said the editor had been notified, and after discussions were held with their foreign consultant, the corrections would be included in the next edition.The company claimed the typesetting had been outsourced to an outside company. It acknowledged that there were many mistakes after proofreading and if readers find errors they are welcome to report them to the publisher via email. It also pledged to reply and deal with the issues.On Saturday (March 25), Taiwan News purchased a copy of the 2020 edition at the Hess Bookstore in Taipei City's Zhongshan District and all the reported errors were present. ACME Cultural Enterprise Co. has yet to respond to multiple requests for comment on why it has yet to recall the defective dictionaries.""Birthday"" misspelled. (Eryk Smith photo)""Rice"" misspelled.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845873,Protesters greet Netanyahu as he meets UK leader in London,"LONDON (AP) — British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak held talks with Benjamin Netanyahu in London on Friday as protesters shouting “Shame!” In Hebrew demonstrated against the Israeli leader’s right-wing policies and his plans to overhaul the country’s judiciary.Netanyahu had to pass by hundreds of protesters waving Israeli flags and waving signs calling for the defense of Israeli democracy as he arrived at 10 Downing St. for talks that focused on the war in Ukraine and concerns about Iran’s nuclear program.Sunak also raised Netanyahu's controversial judicial reforms, which have sparked mass protests in Israel and beyond. One placard in London read: “We are Israelis and Jews living in the U.K. demonstrating against Prime Minister Netanyahu, who is leading a judicial coup turning Israel into a dictatorship.”Some women protesting outside Downing Street wore red robes and white caps inspired by “The Handmaid's Tale,” a novel and TV series set in a dystopian future. Similarly clad demonstrators have become fixtures of the mass protests roiling Israel.Sunak “stressed the importance of upholding the democratic values that underpin our relationship, including in the proposed judicial reforms in Israel,” the British leader's office said in an official readout of the meeting.Netanyahu’s proposals would give his government more control over judicial appointments, weaken the Supreme Court by limiting judicial review of legislation and allow Parliament to overturn court decisions with a simple majority vote.He arrived in London as protesters in Israel blocked roads and clashed with police. The planned judicial system overhaul have ignited the biggest protests in the country’s history amid rare dissent from people throughout Israeli society, including military reservists, navy veterans, high-tech businesspeople and former officials.Netanyahu’s right-wing government has also been criticized for its hard-line policy toward Palestinians, including recent comments by a government minister who denied the existence of the Palestinian people and their right to self-determination.Sunak “reiterated our support for two-state solution,” and Britain's view that Israel's West Bank settlements are illegal and ”contrary to the cause of peace,"" spokesman Jamie Davies said.“Israel is a vital international partner for the United Kingdom, and the prime minister was visiting London, and this was an important opportunity to talk about issues that matter to both countries, whether that’s the threat of Iran, Russia, new trade and investment … as well as peace and stability in the Middle East,"" Davies said.Netanyahu’s office said the two leaders discussed the rapidly advancing nuclear program of Israel’s archenemy, Iran, as well as “deepening strategic cooperation in security, intelligence and economic fields.”As thousands of people took to the streets across Israel on Thursday, Netanyahu, who is on trial for corruption, defiantly pledged to proceed with the judicial overhaul, hours after his coalition passed a law making it harder to remove him from office.Rights groups and Palestinians say Israel’s democratic ideals have long been tarnished by the country’s 55-year, open-ended occupation of lands the Palestinians seek for an independent state and the treatment of Palestinian Israeli citizens, who face discrimination in many spheres.Netanyahu pushed back his departure to Britain until 4 a.m. Friday to deal with the political crisis.",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845874,Indigenous artists help skateboarding earn stamp of approval,"PHOENIX (AP) — Years ago, skateboarding was branded as a hobby for rebels or stoners in city streets, schoolyards and back alleys. Those days are long gone.Skateboarding, which has Native Hawaiian roots connected to surfing, no longer is on the fringes. It became an Olympic sport in 2020. There are numerous amateur and professional skateboarding competitions in the U.S. And on Friday, the U.S. Postal Service is issuing stamps that laud the sport — and what Indigenous groups have brought to the skating culture.Di'Orr Greenwood, 27, an artist born and raised on the Navajo Nation in Arizona whose work is featured on the new stamps, says it's a long way from when she was a kid and people always kicked her out of certain spots just for skating.“Now it's like being accepted on a global scale,"" Greenwood said. ""There's so many skateboarders I know that are extremely proud of it.""The postal agency ceremoniously unveiled the “Art of the Skateboard"" stamps in a Phoenix skate park as a skateboarding competition was going on nearby.The stamps feature skateboard artists from around the country, including Greenwood and Crystal Worl, who is Tlingit Athabascan. William James Taylor Jr., an artist from Virginia, and Federico ""MasPaz"" Frum, a Colombian-born muralist in Washington, D.C., round out the quartet of featured artists. Everyone but Taylor was in attendance.“Over time skateboards themselves have become works of art highlighting artists' creativity, boldness and energy,” William Zollars, of the USPS Board of Governors, told an audience of city officials and supporters. “As an American institution older than the country itself, the Postal Service is always looking for ways to highlight and honor stories and histories that are unique to the United States.”The stamps underscore the prevalence of skateboarding, especially in Indian Country where the demand for skate parks is growing.The artists see the stamp as a small canvas, a functional art piece that will be seen across the U.S. and beyond.“Maybe I'll get a letter in the mail that someone sent me with my stamp on it,” said Worl, 35, who lives in Juneau, Alaska. “I think that’s when it will really hit home with the excitement of that.”Antonio Alcalá, USPS art director, led the search for artists to paint skate decks for the project. After settling on a final design, each artist received a skateboard from Alcalá to work on. He then photographed the maple skate decks and incorporated them into an illustration of a young person holding up a skateboard for display. The person is seen in muted colors to draw attention to the skate deck.Alcalá used social media to seek out artists who, besides being talented, were knowledgeable about skateboarding culture. Worl was already on his radar because her brother, Rico, designed the Raven Story stamp in 2021, which honored a central figure in Indigenous stories along the coast in the Pacific Northwest.The Worl siblings run an online shop called Trickster Company with fashions, home goods and other merchandise with Indigenous and modern twists. For her skate deck, Crystal Worl paid homage to her clan and her love of the water with a Sockeye salmon against a blue and indigo background.She was careful about choosing what to highlight.""There are certain designs, patterns and stories that belong to certain clans and you have to have permission even as an Indigenous person to share certain stories or designs,” Worl said.The only times Navajo culture has been featured in stamps is with rugs or necklaces. Greenwood, who tried out for the U.S. Women’s Olympic skateboarding team, knew immediately she wanted to incorporate her heritage in a modern way. Her nods to the Navajo culture include a turquoise inlay and a depiction of eagle feathers, which are used to give blessings.“I was born and raised with my great-grandmother, who looked at a stamp kind of like how a young kid would look at an iPhone 13,” Greenwood said. ""She entrusted every important news and every important document and everything to a stamp to send it and trust that it got there.”Skateboarding has become a staple across Indian Country. In Oregon, the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs will reopen a refurbished skate park March 29 thanks to a partnership with pro skateboarder Tony Hawk's nonprofit, The Skatepark Project. Skateboarders on the Fort Apache Indian Reservation in eastern Arizona recently got funding from there, too. A skate park opened in August on the Hopi reservation. Youth-organized competitions take place on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota.Dustinn Craig, a White Mountain Apache filmmaker and “lifer” skateboarder in Arizona, has made documentaries and short films on the sport. The 47-year-old remembers how skateboarding was seen as dorky and anti-establishment when he was a kid hiding “a useless wooden toy” in his locker. At the same time, Craig credits skateboarding culture as “my arts and humanities education.”So he is wary of the mainstream’s embrace, as well as the sometimes clique-ish nature, of today's skateboarding world.“For those of us who have been in it for a very long time, it’s kind of insulting because I think a lot of the popularity has been due to the proliferation of access to the visuals of the youth culture skateboarding through the internet and social media,” Craig said. “So, I feel like it really sort of trivializes and sort of robs Native youth of authenticity of the older skateboard culture that I was raised on.”He acknowledges that he may come off as the “grumpy old man” to younger Indigenous skateboarders who are open to collaborating with outsiders.The four skateboards designed by the artists will eventually be transferred to the Smithsonian National Postal Museum, said Jonathan Castillo, USPS spokesperson.The stamps, which will have a printing of 18 million, will be available at post offices and on the USPS website beginning Friday. For the artists, being part of a project that feels low-tech in this age of social media is exciting.“It’s like the physical thing is special because you go out of your way to go to the post office, buy the stamps and write something,” Worl said.___Terry Tang is a member of The Associated Press’ Race and Ethnicity team.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845875,"India expels Rahul Gandhi, Modi critic, from Parliament","NEW DELHI (AP) — India's top opposition leader and fierce critic of Prime Minister Narendra Modi was expelled from Parliament Friday, a day after a court convicted him of defamation and sentenced him to two years in prison for mocking the surname Modi in an election speech.The actions against Rahul Gandhi, the great-grandson of India’s first prime minister, were widely condemned by opponents of Modi as the latest assaults against democracy and free speech by a ruling government seeking to crush dissent. Removing Gandhi from politics delivered a major blow to the opposition party he led ahead of next year’s national elections.A local court from Modi’s home state of Gujarat convicted Gandhi on Thursday for a 2019 speech in which he asked, “Why do all thieves have Modi as their surname?” Gandhi then referred to three well-known and unrelated Modis in the speech: a fugitive Indian diamond tycoon, a cricket executive banned from the Indian Premier League tournament and the prime minister.Under Indian law, a criminal conviction and prison sentence of two years or more are grounds for expulsion from Parliament, but Gandhi is out on bail for 30 days and plans to appeal.Opposition lawmakers rallied to his defense on Friday, calling his expulsion a new low for India’s constitutional democracy.Modi’s critics say India’s democracy — the world’s largest with nearly 1.4 billion people — has been in retreat since he first came to power in 2014. They accuse his populist government of preoccupying itself with pursuing a Hindu nationalist agenda, a charge his administration has denied.“I am fighting for the voice of this country. I am ready to pay any price,” Gandhi, 52, wrote on Twitter.Gandhi’s family, starting with his great-grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru, has produced three prime ministers. Two of them — his grandmother, Indira Gandhi, and father, Rajiv Gandhi — were assassinated.Gandhi has projected himself as the main challenger to the Modi government, but his Indian National Congress party has fared poorly during the last two general elections. He has been trying to woo voters in recent months by raising issues of corruption and accusing the Modi government of tarnishing India’s reputation for democracy.Late last year Gandhi led a popular “unity march” across wide swaths of India, rallying crowds against the Modi government and the Hindu nationalism that has surged under his leadership.Opponents blame Modi’s political party for rising hate speech and violence against Muslims and other minorities in recent years. Modi’s power has coincided with increasing assaults on the press and free speech, the jailing of activists and a crackdown on dissent.Modi’s party has denied the accusations and his supporters say the tea seller’s son from Gujarat state has improved the nation’s standing.Gandhi has also attacked the government over Modi’s proximity to business tycoon Gautam Adani, who in January was accused by an American research and investment firm betting against his company of engaging in fraud and stock-price manipulation. Before his expulsion, Gandhi had called for an investigation into Adani’s businesses, whose market value has plummeted by tens of billions of dollars. Modi’s party say he has no links with Adani.If Gandhi's conviction is not suspended or overturned by a higher court, he faces the risk of not being able to contest national elections in 2024, although some analysts say an eventual return to politics is possible.“This could actually also provide an impetus for the opposition to finally sink their differences and come together in a united fight against Modi,” said Arti Jerath, a political commentator.Gandhi's political party said the conviction, which they plan to appeal, was “cowardly and dictatorial” and leaders warned that his expulsion could do long-term damage to the country.“This is politics with the gloves off and it bodes ill for our democracy,” said Shashi Tharoor, a lawmaker from Gandhi’s party.Modi's critics point to his party's attacks against opposition leaders, rights groups and media outlets critical of the government.Last month India’s tax officials raided BBC offices in New Delhi and Mumbai weeks after it aired a documentary critical of Modi. The documentary examined his role in 2002 anti-Muslim riots in the western state of Gujarat, where he was chief minister at the time. More than 1,000 people were killed in the violence.Modi has denied allegations that authorities under his watch allowed and even encouraged the bloodshed, and the Supreme Court said it found no evidence to prosecute him.Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, a political analyst, said the ruling party had become increasingly angered by Gandhi's corruption accusations and that his line of attack against the Adani Group was “proving too much for the governing party.”Gandhi's expulsion also came after fourteen political parties filed a petition to India’s top court alleging that Modi’s government was engaged in politically motivated financial-crime investigations of opposition leaders. The Supreme Court said it will take up the petition in the first week of April.",2023/03/27,,World

The fire was largely extinguished at 8:40 p.m.Officers suspected the cause was linked to some sparks triggered by construction work, but they would have to probe further into the cause, said Wilson Kong, divisional officer of the Fire Services Department.There were inflammable substances at the warehouse and the fire equipment, including the sprinkler system, could not work properly there, he said.Kam Hok-lai, acting ambulance superintendent, said one person felt sick after inhaling thick smoke and another person sustained hand injuries. Three firefighters also felt sick, he added.About 3,600 people had to be evacuated, including students from four schools, said police divisional commander Wong Wai-yin.Earlier Friday afternoon, officers at the scene had to wear breathing apparatus.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845877,Feet for a king: Westminster Abbey to offer barefoot tours,"LONDON (AP) — People who visit London's Westminster Abbey after the coronation of King Charles III will be allowed to stand on the exact spot where he was crowned, but they will need to make sure they don't have holes in their socks for the shoeless tour, designed to protect the abbey's medieval mosaic floor.Abbey officials said Friday that the section of the church's floor known as the Cosmati pavement, where the chair in which Britain's monarchs are crowned has been placed for some 700 years, will be on display during Charles' May 6 coronation after being hidden away under carpets for decades because of disrepair.The pavement area, normally roped off to the public, will be open to small guided “barefoot tours” after the crowning ceremony. Visitors will be asked to remove their shoes to avoid wear and tear to the floor, which was restored to its former glory after a two-year conservation project was completed in 2010.“Standing on the pavement and feeling that sense of awe of being in the central part of the abbey is a really amazing experience,"" Scott Craddock, the head of visitor experience at the famous church. “It will give people the opportunity to feel what it’s like being at that center stage of the coronation.”King Henry III commissioned the intricate mosaic of marble, stone, glass and metal, located in front of the abbey's high altar, in the 1200s. Italian craftsmen and English masons made it.It is where English — and, later, British — coronations have taken place ever since, but the area was covered by carpet at many previous coronations, including those of Elizabeth II in 1953 and her father, George VI, in 1937.The mosaic is said to be the best surviving example outside Italy of a rare type of stonework known as “Cosmati,” after the Italian family which created it.“It's a unique piece of art to Westminster Abbey but also to Britain itself — there are no other mosaic pavements like this in the U.K.,” Vanessa Simeoni, the abbey's head conservator, said.Experts from the abbey will guide the tours, which will run on some days from May 15 to July 29.",2023/03/24,,World

(AP) — At least three people were found dead this week after their vehicles were swept away by floodwaters in Arizona, authorities said.Gila County Sheriff’s officials said the bodies of a couple missing after their vehicle was stuck in floodwaters in the Payson area were located Thursday. They were identified as Phon Sutton, 85, and Dara Sutton, 72, both of Payson, Arizona.Separately, the Navajo County Sheriff’s Office said the body of a 64-year-old woman was recovered after the vehicle she was traveling in with her husband was swept downstream at a river crossing.Flooding caused by recent rainfall and snowmelt has created issues across parts of central and northern Arizona with residents in several low-lying communities told to evacuate.Gila County authorities said search and rescue crews were dispatched Wednesday morning after county authorities received a 911 call about a pickup truck found in Tonto Creek.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845879,Euro 2024 host Germany looks to rebuild after World Cup,"DÜSSELDORF, Germany (AP) — Another World Cup failure, another rebuild for Germany. This time there's even more at stake.Germany will host next year's European Championship and is desperate to avoid another debacle at home.The Germans once took pride in having a “tournament team,” one that could put distractions aside to perform when it mattered. Following group-stage exits at the 2018 and 2022 World Cups and a round-of-16 loss at the last European Championship, however, Germany has not won a knockout game since the now-defunct Confederations Cup in 2017.The current rebuild — with Germany able to skip qualifying as Euro 2024 host — starts with friendlies against Peru on Saturday and Belgium on Tuesday.Germany coach Hansi Flick's squad is a mix of regulars like Emre Can, Timo Werner and Joshua Kimmich, and some more experimental picks. The six players getting their first call-ups include two right backs, Josha Vagnoman and Marius Wolf. There is also AC Milan defender Malick Thiaw and 21-year-old winger Kevin Schade, who is a bench player for Brentford in the Premier League.Just like predecessor Joachim Löw after the 2018 World Cup, Flick has left out Bayern Munich forward Thomas Müller. The 33-year-old Müller signaled his international career might be over in an emotional interview at the World Cup in Qatar, but then changed tack to say he was still available for selection.Müller has been here before. After Löw dropped him in 2018, he ended up being recalled in 2021 in the aftermath of a 6-0 loss to Spain.“We appreciate each other and will continue to be in good contact,” Müller posted on Instagram last week after it was confirmed Flick would not select him.Some other big names are out of the squad temporarily, whether because of injury (goalkeeper Manuel Neuer broke his leg while skiing) or personal reasons (midfielder Ilkay Gündogan became a father last week). The reasons for dropping Real Madrid defender Antonio Rüdiger and Bayern forward Leroy Sané are less clear-cut, but seem to be part of Flick’s experiments in the rebuild.Flick already bet on youth in his World Cup squad by selecting forwards Jamal Musiala, Karim Adeyemi and Youssoufa Moukoko, which made the latter the youngest player to ever play for Germany at the tournament at 18. All three will be missing from the upcoming games with injuries.Another promising youngster, Bayer Leverkusen attacking midfielder Florian Wirtz, will return after missing the World Cup with injury.Löw spent 2019 and 2020 working on his own failed rebuild. That means there is already a large pool of players who have been tried in the Germany team and discarded, especially at problem positions like left back, where Flick seems to have settled on Leipzig defender David Raum over other potential candidates like Inter Milan's Robin Gosens.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845880,EU leaders play down bank risks as economy weakens,"BRUSSELS (AP) — European Union leaders Friday played down the risk of a banking crisis developing from recent global financial turbulence and hitting the economy even harder than the energy crunch tied to Russia’s war in Ukraine.After a meeting in Brussels, the EU government heads said lenders in Europe are generally in sound health and in a position to weather a combination of rising interest rates and slowing economic growth.“The banking system is stable in Europe,” German Chancellor Olaf Scholz told reporters after the summit. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said: “Generally, I think we are in good shape.”The EU deliberations came in the wake of U.S. regulators’ shutdown of two U.S. banks, including Silicon Valley Bank, and a Swiss-orchestrated takeover of troubled lender Credit Suisse by rival UBS.The emergency actions on both sides of the Atlantic revived memories of the 2008 global financial meltdown and the ensuing EU sovereign debt crisis, which almost broke apart the euro currency now shared by 20 European countries.In a sign of market jitters in Europe, shares of Deutsche Bank, Germany’s largest lender, fell as much as 14% in Frankfurt on Friday. The drop, which dragged down the stocks of other European lenders, followed a steep rise in the cost of financial derivatives known as credit default swaps that insure bondholders against the bank defaulting on its debts.Scholz dismissed the idea of basic weaknesses at Deutsche Bank, saying it has become “very profitable” after modernizing its business.“There is no reason to have any concerns,” he said.The European economy has been slowing rapidly since Russia invaded Ukraine 13 months ago to the day, leaving the EU flirting with recession. The war has fueled inflation by prompting cuts in supplies of previously abundant Russian oil, natural gas and coal and dented consumer and business confidence.The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, expects economic growth in the 27-nation bloc to slow to 0.8% this year from 3.5% in 2022 and 5.4% in 2021. A projected rebound in growth to 1.6% next year depends on a sound banking sector able to lend to businesses and consumers and protect deposits.The EU has beefed up its regulation of financial institutions since the euro debt crisis and little sign had emerged before Friday of broader contagion in Europe from Credit Suisse’s dramatic rescue.Nonetheless, financial supervision in Europe remains a patchwork of EU and national authorities pursuing common approaches rather than heeding an actual single European rulebook.For example, the euro area still lacks a common deposit insurance system, which is widely considered a key defense against future European bank crises. A stalemate among national capitals over how to share risk has left the bloc without this regulatory pillar.On the market front, officials have said European banks generally have adequate cash buffers — while still urging vigilance. “Our banking sector is resilient, with strong capital and liquidity positions,” the EU leaders said in a joint statement after their meeting.On his way into it, Paschal Donohoe, head of the group of euro-area finance ministers and Ireland’s public-expenditure minister, echoed the point while saying: “We can never be complacent.”One reason for prudence is that the European Central Bank has raised interest rates from record lows, denting the balance sheets of lenders and making it more expensive for consumers and businesses to get loans. The ECB is seeking to bring stubbornly high euro-area inflation, which was 8.5% in February, closer to a 2% target.ECB President Christine Lagarde and Donohoe attended the EU summit to share their views about the economy.Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis of Greece, the country that triggered the euro-area debt troubles more than a decade ago, drew a link between the current state of Greek banks and that of European financial institutions as a whole.“The banking system in Europe is stable and robust,” Mitsotakis said. “I’m absolutely confident about the stability and the robustness of the Greek banks.”",2023/03/24,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845921,EU weighs up future of wood-burning as renewable energy source,"The European Union’s race to rid itself of dependence on Russian fossil fuels is well underway. The International Energy Agency says widespread bids to beef up energy security ""turbocharged"" growth of green power in 2022, and EU parliamentarians hope to ramp up renewables targets to reach 45% of bloc-wide energy consumption by 2030.The word ""renewable"" often conjures up images of wind farms or solar panels — less so scenes of burning trees. But biomass, which includes firewood, plants and other organic materials, makes up 60% of the EU’s renewable energy mix according to the European Commission.As the bloc now reviews its landmark renewable power legislation, a political battle over firewood’s future is playing out in Brussels.Because new trees can be planted after others have been chopped down, firewood gets the renewable seal of approval under EU law. That means member countries can subsidize wood burning, as long as certain sustainable sourcing rules are met.But Martin Pigeon of Brussels-based forest protection campaign group Fern argues the subsidy setup is ""insane"" as it means ""EU citizens are paying energy companies to burn forests in the midst of a climate and biodiversity crisis.""Industry groups refute these claims. Bioenergy Europe is a Brussels-based nonprofit focused on raising “awareness, acceptance and reputation of bioenergy.” The organization represents more than 150 energy companies and 40 associations — and Policy Officer Irene Di Padua told DW in written comments that responsibly sourced biomass “is essential for the EU’s green transition, especially in providing renewable heat.”“Bioenergy needs to comply with strict sustainability criteria that ensure sourcing and use of biomass for energy does not cause any environmental harm or biodiversity loss,” she said.Martin Pigeon, however, argues that those criteria are “not strict.”The climate impact of wood-burning is contested. The EU officially counts wood and other biomass as carbon neutral, based on the premise that CO2 emitted through burning will be reabsorbed by more trees in future. But the European Academies Science Advisory Council says scientific study suggests the trend to replace coal with wood pellets as a means of generating electricity actually increases “atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide for substantial periods of time.""A 2019 EASAC report says the time it takes for carbon emissions associated with woodburning to be evened out can range from years to decades or even centuries, depending on conditions.The European Parliament wants to limit subsidies for burning wood taken directly from forests, and instead restrict state support to secondary wood products like sawdust.Lawmakers also want to phase down the amount of wood that counts toward EU renewable energy targets.Nils Torvalds, one of the lawmakers working on the legislation, said the proposal is ""the parliament’s way of trying to limit the unsustainable and inefficient use"" of wood.But Eurelectric, an industry group representing national electricity associations and major electricity companies across Europe, told DW that the European Parliament proposals would ""disturb the practicalities of forest management, lead to further supply shortages of sustainable biomass, and thus impair energy security and increase prices.”In a 2022 letter to EU member states, Eurelectric also argued that the suggestion to restrict subsidies could result in some wood excluded from support under proposals, to decompose on forest floors. ""This causes CO2 emissions but yields no energy,"" the group said.EU member states, meanwhile, prefer a looser definition of which type of wood can be subsidized. One diplomat who asked not to be named told DW ""there’s a feeling that with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with the energy crisis, member states do think that bioenergy is an important renewable source of energy. It has an important contribution to the energy system and to reaching the climate goals.""Negotiations on the details of the legislation continue this month.The European Commission has also put forward plans to tighten laws on which firewood qualifies for subsidies. A spokesperson told DW that proposals include barring wood sourced from ancient forests, and only greenlighting state support for lumber from ""highly biodiverse forests when there's no interference with nature protection purposes.""Under the plans, all wood-burning power plants will also have to meet certain greenhouse gas saving thresholds.But the track record on existing rules leaves room for concern. National authorities are supposed to transpose EU standards into domestic legislation, but the European Commission spokesperson told DW that the body launched legal action against all 27 member states in 2021 for failing to complete this process or failing to notify Brussels of completion.“We are closely monitoring this process and stand ready to take enforcement actions, if needed,” the spokesperson said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845923,Dutch election fallout: What next for the agriculture sector?,"Upside-down Dutch flags flanking the roadside have become a feature of driving through the Netherlands' lush, low-lying fields in recent months.These flags epitomize Dutch farmers' resistance to the government's proposal of slashing nitrogen emissions by 50 % nationwide by 2030 and the attendant impact on their livelihoods.Ministers have called the proposal an ""unavoidable transition"" that aims to improve air, land and water quality. They have also warned that this could mean some farmers being forced out of business.The results of the country's provincial elections — held on March 15 — could, however, signify a change in fortune for Dutch farmers.The Boer-Burger Beweging (BBB), or Farmer-Citizen Movement which gained momentum during the farmer's protests, landed a major victory and is set to become the largest party in the Senate (the Netherlands' upper house), winning 15 out of 75 seats.The Dutch Green and Left parties are also projected to win 15 seats and the ruling Dutch government coalition consisting of the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD), Democrats 66 (D66), Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) and the Christian Union (CU), is set to lose 8 of its 32 seats.While the results are not what Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte was hoping for, BBB leader Caroline van der Plas told Dutch broadcaster Radio 1 that ""voters have spoken out very clearly against this government's policies.""According to Jeroen Candel, associate professor of food and agricultural policy at Wageningen University & Research (WUR), these provincial elections are likely to have quite an impact on farming policies in the Netherlands going forward.""Firstly, the BBB party mainly represents farmers' short-term economic interests and is against the government's nitrogen emissions law,"" Candel told DW.""Secondly, the Dutch Parliament consists of two chambers and while the House of Representatives, or lower chamber, is directly elected through national elections, the Senate — which traditionally assesses the quality of laws proposed by the lower chamber, but has become increasingly political —- is elected through the provinces,"" he said.""Now that the government coalition lost its majority in the Senate, it may be increasingly difficult for them to get their nitrogen plans accepted by Parliament,” he added.Max van der Sleen, economist with the Dutch network Mobilisation for Environment, added that the BBB's victory last week will also increase respect for the farming sector.""Farmers are now going to be able to have more of a say in politics. With roughly 7% of the Dutch population living in rural areas, the BBB's victory means the farming sector will get disproportionately more importance,"" van der Sleen commented.The Netherlands is the world's second-largest agricultural exporter. Its farming methods are intensive, however, with a relatively large number of livestock and fertilizers being used.This has led to high levels of nitrous oxide in the country's soil and water — levels are currently higher than European Union regulations allow.""If there is a choice in legislation between making money or taking care of nature, our government has for the last 12 years chosen to make money,"" Van der Sleen said.""But when the EU announced in 2007 that they would stop with the milk quota because China became a bigger market player, the Netherlands started increasing its animal husbandry sector and the country's milk production has increased by 30% since that time. So instead of balancing the agricultural sector with environmental protection, the Netherlands continued increasing the output of its animal husbandry sector,"" he explained.Noting that the agriculture sector was responsible for producing quantities of excess nitrogen — harmful to public health and the environment — the Netherlands' Council of State, a constitutional advisory body to the government, took action in 2019, ruling that nitrogen deposits in the country would have to be curtailed.The Council also highlighted that the existing system of handing out environmental permits for economic activities was in violation of the EU habitats directive — which ensures the EU's biodiversity is conserved — while also adding to the nitrogen problem.""The government then had to suddenly introduce drastic measures to reduce nitrogen emissions after this ruling. This came as a shock to many farmers because for years they had been told that they could expand their farms and now suddenly many of them would have to decrease the amount of livestock that they keep or even shut down their businesses,"" Candel said.To match its 50% targets for slashing nitrogen, the government has said that around 11,200 farms will have to close and another 17,600 farmers will have to significantly reduce their livestock.While these rules have disappointed and angered farmers, especially those in the livestock sector, each farmer's opinion varies.Douwe Mulder runs a family farm in Friesland, North Holland, and owns a flock of about 200 dairy cattle.""Farmers in both North and South Holland view the legislation differently, because it comes down to which farmer has the license to produce, since the law said to continue dairy farming, you need a permit. Those who don't get permits will be forced to shut businesses and are angry,"" he told DW.After last week's vote, BBB's Van der Plas says Wednesday's vote was about more than the farm pollution issue.""Nitrate is a symbol for dissatisfaction in the country,"" she told NOS on Thursday, adding that many BBB voters ""feel unheard, unseen"" by politicians in The Hague.""It hurt us that the government thinks our emissions are more than planes and cars. But on our farm, we keep an eye on the European goals and focus on maintaining a balance between farming and protecting the environment. Our goal is not to milk too many cows, or use too much manure which will lead to pollution,"" Mulder said.With upside-down Dutch flags continuing to line fields a week after the provincial elections, Candel told DW that, in the immediate term, the government will have to try to find a majority in the Senate to obtain support for their nitrogen policies.""They could either do so by collaborating with the Left, because the Labour Party and the Greens already collaborate with each other, and together with the pro-EU party VOLT could help the coalition to gain a majority. Or they could collaborate with the BBB. But that would put their nitrogen emission plans on the backburner, and as such pose a risk to the stability of the coalition itself,"" he said.In the long term, he said that the Dutch government needs to consider reforms in the livestock sector besides simply depending on technological innovations.Mulder, who voted in the recent provincial elections, thinks that further dialogue between the political parties in the Senate, with each of them listening in an effort to understand each other, could help in solving conflicts of interest.Such conversations have begun with the regional government in Van der Sleen's island, Goeree-Overflakkee in South Holland.""We have set up a nature group with nature experts, and an agriculture group with farmers. These two groups are supposed to have a look at the future or the next 30 years. ‘What does our island look like? What is possible? What is not possible? And how will that affect the nitrogen ammonia and NO situation?' are some of the questions asked. So local solutions could also address the national debate,"" Van der Sleen said.Meanwhile, Candel also highlighted that there are also lessons that can be learned from other countries in Europe.""If you look at France, they have a whole program on what they call agro-ecology, through which they are trying to reduce the amount of fertilizers and pesticides within agriculture and come up with more ecologically friendly modes of production. In Austria and Denmark, the government has done a lot to promote organic farming. So there are other EU member states which have already taken action at an earlier phase,"" he said.Van der Sleen shared a similar view, adding that even Switzerland where they have prioritized health and say that they will produce healthy food with good conditions for farmers, could be an inspiration.""But this would mean food prices would be higher. In other words, they undertake less production, but higher prices, because they think this is valuable. So that is a direction the Netherlands could try,"" he said.Edited by: Lucy James",2023/03/24,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845924,King Charles postpones France visit amid mass strikes,"A planned state visit by recently crowned King Charles III to France has been postponed amid ongoing pension reform protests, the French presidency said on Friday.The decision was taken following a phone call between French President Emmanuel Macron and the King himself.""This decision was taken by the French and British governments after a telephone conversation between the president and the king this morning,"" Macron's office said in a statement. ""This state visit will be reorganized as soon as possible.""""Given the announcement yesterday of another national day of protests against pension reform on Tuesday March 28, the visit of Charles III, initially scheduled from 26-28 March, has been postponed,"" it added.The decision was ""in order to be able to welcome His Majesty King III in conditions which reflect our friendly relations.""The news comes as millions of people in France continue to take part in mass protests and strikes against a law that will set back the retirement age by two years.Charles and Queen Consort Camilla ""greatly look forward to the opportunity to visit France as soon as dates can be found,"" a statement from Buckingham Palace said.Charles, who only ascended the British throne last September, was set to arrive in France on Sunday before heading on to Germany, in what would have been his first official trip as King.The plan to visit Germany from Wednesday to Friday will go ahead as planned, Buckingham Palace said.But protest action in France has shown no signs of abating, with over a million people taking to the streets on Thursday and the French government saying that further protests and strike action were planned for Tuesday.Earlier on Friday, French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin had announced the mobilization of 4,000 gendarme officers for the king's visit.The king had been planning to take a train ride to Bordeaux where he wanted to meet with an organic winemaker. On Thursday night, protesters in Bordeaux set fire to the door of the town hall.ab/rc (AP, Reuters, AFP, dpa)",2023/03/24,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845929,Life in Myanmar's Yangon after COVID and a coup,"At first glance, Yangon seems to have hardly changed since the time before the pandemic and the coup. In the mornings and evenings, cars jam the city's main streets. At night, the golden needle of the Shwedagon Pagoda shines over the city.On the weekends, couples hold hands and walk along Inya Lake, while middle-class shoppers head to modern malls. This even includes the ""Myanmar Plaza"" mall, which was boycotted after the coup for its connections with the ruling junta.However, a closer look reveals how things have changed here in this city of 7.3 million people. At every major crossing, concrete bunkers have been erected, complete with sandbags. The windows are covered in green nets, so you cannot see whether there are armed police stationed inside.It becomes clear that at least some of the bunkers are occupied, as now and then rifle barrels protrude over the sandbags or helmets in blue-gray camouflage patch lie on the sandbags.After spending more time in Yangon, it is clear the city is not like other Southeast Asian metropolises, where life and business are bustling.Everywhere in the city, abandoned construction projects are a reminder that growth here is at a standstill, as those in charge make sure that no resistance to their power can emerge.However, ""normal"" criminality is often ignored in Myanmar. A Yangon resident told DW anonymously that the police do not have enough resources. The man said he went to the police after a bicycle theft. Usually, people don't trust the police anymore, but in this case, the man had known the policeman in his neighborhood for many years. The policeman also wanted to help, but said that he did not have enough officers. The police officers were all occupied enforcing the curfew at night or searching for opponents of the military regime.Currently, Yangon is under a curfew from midnight to 4:00 a.m. If you look out of your hotel room during this time, the metropolis is deserted. Now and then a pickup truck manned by five or six armed police officers makes its rounds through the empty streets. Entire neighborhoods lie in complete darkness.Life in Yangon's poorest areas has become more and more desperate. Hundreds of thousands do not know in the morning how they will find something to eat during the day. There are no reliable figures, but unemployment has also risen sharply.Pressure on poor neighborhoods is further increased by the large number of refugees fleeing to Yangon from regions where civil war is raging.One man told DW anonymously that his entire extended family fled to Yangon from the embattled Chin State for security reasons. Only two uncles stayed behind to guard the houses and property.Even people who have jobs have to deal with a difficult economic environment.Since the coup, Yangon's industrial parks have been lacking orders. At one company for electronic parts that DW was able to visit, production has plummeted by 70%.Large areas of the factory complex remain unused. At other factories in the production zone, one entrepreneur told DW, the situation is no different. Nevertheless, he has been able to keep all his workers, but without salary increases, which due to inflation amounts to an equivalent loss of income of around 30%.Power outages are another problem for businesses, which need to absorb costs for diesel generators, making production costlier.The military state is obviously not fulfilling its duties to the public. It does not protect its citizens from theft and robbery, it is unable to supply them with electricity, and the economy lies idle.Even infrastructure projects, such as the new road connecting the districts of North and South Okkalapa, which are being pushed by the military government as prestige projects, are a sign that state functions in Myanmar are largely absent.The street lights that are set up there, one man told DW with gallows humor, are probably more intended primarily for posting signs and advertising, since there is no electricity most of the time anyway.Given the situation, it is not surprising that most of the people DW spoke with in Yangon said they are worried, frustrated, exhausted and depressed.Those who joined the armed struggle after the violent suppression of peaceful protests in the spring and summer of 2021 have now largely been pushed out of Yangon.Now, only rarely are there attacks targeting military officers or politicians close to the junta or acts of sabotage.Nowhere in Yangon can the graffiti with the three-finger salute (the sign of resistance), or the slogans of the revolution, still be seen. The armed struggle has shifted from the cities to Myanmar's border region.Those who have the money, along with the necessary language and professional skills, and have no obligations in the country, try to leave Myanmar.Long lines formed mostly of young people are frequently seen in front of the embassies of Japan, South Korea and Germany at visa issuing times.Thousands of refugees arrive monthly at the Thai-Myanmar border town of Mae Sot, which has become something like the unofficial opposition capital of Myanmar. The UN Human Rights Council states that at least 72,000 people left the country between the coup in February 2021 and January 2023.Another form of escape for those who cannot leave the country is the use of alcohol and drugs, which has increased significantly, according to interviewees.In newly opened bars and clubs, such as the ""Octoholic"" on Pho Sein Road, where a giant octopus sculpture above the entrance holds foaming glasses of beer in its tentacles, young people get drunk to the point of unconsciousness.Since the coup, drugs -- especially methamphetamine and heroin -- have been entering the city largely unhindered from notorious drug kitchens in the so-called golden triangle between Myanmar, Thailand and Laos. Here, too, police look the other way.Other Yangon residents are turning to religion. Many Buddhists DW spoke with have said they are going to the pagoda more often and have started meditating daily.""It is a kind of therapy. To find inner peace,"" one man said. Masses and church services are also well attended on Sundays, as DW was able to observe.Last but not least, many new and also some long-established art galleries have reopened. The art market is booming and works are being traded at high prices. Works by unknown artists can go for up to $50,000.Money laundering is probably behind this, because it was difficult to launder money during the months of COVID lockdowns and the curfews during the coup. In any case, artists welcome the growing market for their work.""It's good that artists can work and sell again. Art opens a space,"" one artist told DW. By that, he is referring to a space for self-expression and for processing the experiences of the last few years. ""People starting to breathe again after months of holding their breath.""DW asked another resident if things were returning to normal in Yangon. ""Nobody wants to live under the military, but we have to live.""For this article, a dozen interviews were conducted in Yangon with journalists, intellectuals, artists, entrepreneurs, NGO staff, students, analysts and representatives of embassies and institutions. For security reasons, DW's interview partners are not identified in more detail.Edited by: Shamil Shams",2023/03/24,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845930,"Eurozone growth at 10-month high in March, S&P says","Economic growth in the Eurozone accelerated in March to a ten-month high, the S&P Global PMI output index said in its latest report on Friday.The indicator was at 54.1, up from 52.0 in February. A reading that surpasses 50 is considered growth in economic activity.The index considered the growth a sign of a reviving economy, after late last year's decline.The Russian war on Ukraine, coming on the heels of a two-year global pandemic that brought several economies to a halt, has left much of the world's economy struggling with inflation, stunted growth, and the looming prospect of recession.Inflationary pressures were in ongoing moderation, and jobs growth was accelerating, the index said.However, the index warned that the overall growth rate was still modest, adding that it was mainly driven by the service sector, with the manufacturing sector still relatively stagnant.The index reported the loss of new orders in the manufacturing sectors, ""meaning current output is only being sustained via backlogs of previously placed orders.""The index also warned of continued high levels of overall input costs and selling price inflation rates ""by historical standards."" It added that a rise in charges was taking place at a pace unseen before the pandemic.""Such stubborn inflationary pressures, fueled primarily by the service sector and rising wage costs, will be a concern to policymakers and suggest that more work may be needed in terms of bringing inflation down to target,"" said Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence.rmt/rc (AFP, Reuters)",2023/03/24,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845935,Ukraine updates: Kyiv prepares for counterassault,"Ukrainian troops are reportedly preparing for a counterattack, after months on the defensive amid Russia's ongoing campaign to capture the eastern town of Bakhmut.Oleksandr Syrskyi, Ukraine's top ground forces commander, was cited by the Reuters news agency as saying that the Kremlin-backed Wagner mercenaries were ""losing considerable strength"" and ""running out of steam."" The group has been at the forefront of Russia's eastern and southern assaults.""Very soon, we will take advantage of this opportunity, as we did in the past near Kyiv, Kharkiv, Balakliya, and Kupiansk,"" he said, listing Ukrainian counteroffensives last year that recaptured swathes of land.Ukraine's General Staff said in a report on Friday that Russian attacks on the towns of Lyman, Avdiivka, Mariinka and Shakhtarske were all unsuccessful. Moscow's main focus, however, remained Bakhmut.Russia has been struggling to capture the town for months, stressing the move would be strategic while Western analysts downplay its importance.Capturing Bakhmut would not only give Russian fighters a rare battlefield gain after months of setbacks but could also rupture Ukraine's supply lines, allowing Moscow's forces to advance toward other Ukrainian strongholds in the eastern Donetsk region.Here are some of the other notable developments concerning the war in Ukraine on Friday, March 24:A Russian airstrike on the city of Kostyantynivka in the eastern Donetsk region hit a homeless shelter, killing three women and injuring two other individuals, Ukraine's emergency service said on Friday.The deceased women were internally displaced from Bakhmut, Chasiv Yar and Opytne, towns nearby at the center of the conflict.Lying some 25 kilometers (15 miles) west of Bakhmut, Kostyantynivka is an industrial city which has seen long and bloody fighting since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.Kremlin welcomes Danish invitation of Gazprom to salvage Nord Stream objectThe Kremlin on Friday welcomed Denmark's decision to invite Russian energy giant Gazprom to help salvage an object discovered next to one of the Nord Stream pipelines, which were sabotaged last September.""It's certainly positive news when the owner of the pipeline is invited to take part in very important phases of the investigation,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.The Russian-controlled Gazprom owns most of the two Nord Stream pipelines, with the rest of the stakes owned by German, French and Dutch companies.Peskov said that identifying the object was important, as well as conducting the investigation into the blasts with full transparency.Danish authorities announced the discovery of a tubular object of 10 centimeters (3.9 inches) in diameter, protruding some 40 centimeters from the seabed.Peskov said it was ""critically important"" to know whether the discovered object was related to the ""terrorist act"" of sabotaging the pipelines.The New York Times claimed in a report earlier this month that ""pro Ukrainian"" groups were behind the attack on the pipelines. Kyiv vehemently denied any involvement.Russian forces may need to advance as far as Kyiv or Lviv, said Dmitry Medvedev, former Russian president and confidante of President Vladimir Putin.In an interview with Russia's RIA Novosti on Friday, Medvedev was quoted as saying that Russian troops will go where they need to go ""in order to destroy this infection.""""Nothing can be ruled out here,"" Medvedev said.Medvedev went on to say that Russia had no plans for entering a direct conflict with NATO.He said Moscow was interested in resolving the conflict in Ukraine through talks, but warned that any Ukrainian attempts to take the Crimean peninsula would make Russia resort to ""absolutely any weapon"" against Kyiv. Russia annexed the peninsula in 2014.Medvedev, who is now deputy chairman of the country's Security Council, has made increasingly hawkish statements about the invasion of Ukraine.On Wednesday, he said that any attempt to arrest Vladimir Putin abroad in implementation of the International Criminal Court arrest warrant would be seen as ""a declaration of war.""A Russian national escaped house arrest in Milan, Italy, before he was due to be extradited to the US on charges of violating sanctions.Artem Uss, the son of the governor of Russia's Krasnoyarsk Krai region in Siberia, was arrested in October last year as he prepared to board an Istanbul-bound flight.He was later charged by US prosecutors with orchestrating a scheme to unlawfully obtain US military technology and Venezuelan-sanctioned oil.Uss broke his court-ordered electronic bracelet and fled, two days after a judge granted his US extradition order, Italian media reported.EU leaders meeting in Brussels on Thursday endorsed a deal to ramp up the supply of artillery shells to Ukraine as the country defends itself against Russia's unprovoked invasion.Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February last year, Ukrainian authorities have recorded over 75,000 war crimes committed by the Russian armed forces.Chinese President Xi Jinping's three-day visit to Moscow was a political boost to an increasingly isolated Putin.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845936,Taiwan monitors whether ex-President Ma will meet Chinese leader,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Former President Ma Ying-jeou (馬英九) could meet high-level officials during his upcoming trip to China, though there was doubt whether that would include leader Xi Jinping (習近平), the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said Friday (March 24).Ma is scheduled to travel in China from March 27 to April 7, including stopovers in at least five cities. He is said to be meeting with Song Tao (宋濤), the new director of the Cabinet-level Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO).Asked whether Ma was likely to meet other officials, MAC Minister Chiu Tai-san (邱太三) told a radio interview Friday it was highly likely that an official more senior than Song would meet the former president “by coincidence,” but according to current information, that probably would not be Xi, Radio Taiwan International (RTI) reported. When Ma was still president of Taiwan and chairman of the Kuomintang (KMT), he met Xi in Singapore in 2015.Chiu called on Ma to be vigilant about letting himself be used, as Chinese propaganda departments had gone three years without showing any results for their work, so they might try and make up for lost time. With presidential elections coming up in Taiwan next January, the public should pay close attention, the minister said.As the MAC was closely monitoring developments, including Xi’s itinerary, it was unlikely that Ma and Xi would meet again. One candidate for a meeting was Wang Huning (王滬寧), the new chairman of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference and the fourth-ranking member of the Politburo, according to Chiu.",2023/03/24,1273,Politics

She is also expected to face questions over the ECB's interest rate hikes, introduced to curb soaring inflation.Concern over the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank earlier in the month was only made worse when the impact spread across the Atlantic, imperiling 167-year-old Swiss bank Credit Suisse. The bank had to be rescued with a buyout from rival UBS.Turmoil in the banking sector comes after years of cheap money have been restricted by rising interest rates in the EU, as well as in the US.Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent cutting off of gas supplies to Europe sent energy prices soaring, hitting households and industry across the EU.Although inflation has begun to slowly come under control, and the bloc has avoided a technical recession, there are fears that a banking crisis could trigger a larger recession like the one seen after the banking crash of 2008.ab/rc (dpa, Reuters)",2023/03/24,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845940,North Korea tests underwater nuclear drone,"North Korean state media reported on Friday that the country's military had tested a new underwater nuclear drone.The announcement came with tensions around the Korean peninsula running high as the US and South Korea recently concluded their largest joint military exercise in five years. North Korea's Kim Jong Un has vowed to ensure that the two allies will ""plunge into despair"".The new drone dubbed ""Haueil"", meaning ""tsunami"" is intended to be capable of sneaking into enemy waters and destroying naval strike groups and major operational ports.This would be done using large radioactive waves through underwater explosions, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported.During the test, the drone cruised underwater at a depth of 80 to 150 meters (about 260 to 490 feet) for more than 59 hours.Analysts remained skeptical about the readiness of the underwater vehicle. However, they warned that the North Korean dictator is showing off his diverse nuclear tactics as a threat to Washington and Seoul.Ankit Panda, a senior fellow at the US-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace observed that the new drone resembled Russia's nuclear torpedoes — a new type of weapon meant to create destructive, radioactive blasts in coastal areas.North Korea stepped up its weaponry demonstration as Washington and Seoul completed their 11-day joint exercise called ""Freedom Shield 23.""KCNA said Kim had supervised the three-day exercise, which also involved the detonations of mock nuclear warheads.The drills, the media reported, were aimed at alerting the two allies of a brewing ""nuclear crisis"" as they continue with their ""intentional, persistent and provocative war drills.""The US intends to send an aircraft carrier in the coming days for another round of joint drills with Seoul.Kim Jong Un believes that the military drills conducted by the allies are part of a preparation for the invasion of North Korea.However, Seoul and Washington have maintained that the exercises are purely defensive.They have criticized North Korea's tests and accused the isolated country of breaching UN sanctions. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said on Friday that he would ensure that Pyongyang paid for its ""reckless provocation.""In 2022, Pyongyang fired more than 70 missiles. This year, North Korea has fired at least 20 ballistic and cruise missiles over 10 different launch events.Seoul and Washington have responded by expanding their joint military exercises which had been downsized in previous years.ns/rc (AP, Reuters)",2023/03/24,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845942,IOC boss Thomas Bach insists on neutrality of sport,"It was a quiet protest. About 160 Ukrainians and their supporters had gathered in front of the Philharmonic Hall in Essen on Wednesday evening to show their anger and despair regarding recent talks within the International Olympic Committee (IOC). ""Terrorist Putin"" was the message on a sign held by one demonstrator. Another sign read: ""Do not allow Russia and Belarus to go to the Olympics.""The reason for the demonstration in Essen was the visit of IOC President Thomas Bach, who was invited to a political forum to offer his view of the global political situation from a sporting perspective. The IOC is apparently formulating plans to allow athletes from Russia and Belarus to participate in the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris under a neutral flag.Before the event in Essen, Bach met with two representatives of the protesters. Former professional football player Igor Denysiuk, who represented the Ukrainian-German club Opora, appeared frustrated after the roughly 10-minute meeting. In response to the demand that Russia and Belarus be banned from competing in the Olympics, Bach had said, according to Denysiuk, that the IOC cannot do anything against participation unless the United Nations were to oppose it.The discussions in Essen focused on the question of whether sport can be apolitical. The demonstrating Ukrainians had a clear opinion on the matter. ""We want the IOC to stop propagating and tolerating war,"" 23-year-old Ukrainian Yana Koval told DW.  ""It does that when it lets Russian and Belarusian athletes compete under a neutral flag. Russian politics is exploiting this for its propaganda.""Bach defended the IOC at the event. ""The world is governed by politics, not by sports organizations,"" Bach said. ""There is a natural tension there."" Sport, he added, stands for joy, integration and tolerance, and it can build bridges. If politics has the upper hand and does not respect these values, sport can no longer unfold its unifying power. This was shown, he added,  by the Olympic boycotts in the 1970s and 80s.The IOC president himself won team gold with Germany as a fencer at the 1976 Montreal Olympics. 16 African countries boycotted those Games in protest of apartheid in the participating nation of South Africa. Bach was unable to compete in Moscow in 1980 because the West boycotted the Games following the invasion of Afghanistan by the Soviet Union a year earlier. The lesson from the boycotts, Bach said, is that ""we have to be politically neutral, but not apolitical. And we must not fall into the mistake of elevating ourselves as referees.""Bach said sports were often overwhelmed by people calling for activism. ""We cannot solve all the problems of this world with sport,"" Bach said. ""You can't put that on sport, and you can't overload it with that."" That's why a clear distinction from politics is needed, he said. ""A competition among athletes can set an example, it can inspire. But no more."" Politics is responsible for the rest, he said.He also addressed calls for the IOC to completely exclude athletes from Russia and Belarus at the 2024 games in Paris. ""We understand the Ukrainian athletes. No one can get away from the images and the suffering [of the war],"" Bach explained.Bach said Ukraine's government was calling for all Russians and Belarusians to be isolated. This is in contradiction to the UN Declaration of Human Rights and also the Olympic Charter. ""This puts us in a dilemma. If we set a precedent, it will destroy Olympic sport. We're talking about international competitions, which can then become a political pawn.""Next week, the IOC plans to draw up guidelines for qualifying for the 2024 Olympics in Paris. The plans are expected to include the right of athletes from Russia and Belarus to compete. ""Deciding that is not an enviable task,"" Bach said. History will judge it, he said, repeatedly stressing that the IOC's main task is to make peace, not to isolate. The demonstrators outside of the doors of the Essen Philharmonic Hall, however, saw the issue quite differently.This article was originally written in German",2023/03/23,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845946,"Russian strikes in Ukraine kill 10 civilians, wound 20 more","KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Long-range Russian bombardment killed at least 10 civilians and wounded 20 others in several parts of Ukraine on Friday, officials in Kyiv said, as a Kremlin official boasted that its forces were prepared to repel an expected Ukrainian counteroffensive this spring.Five people died in Kostiantynivka, in eastern Ukraine's Donetsk province, when a Russian missile hit an aid station. Ukrainian authorities last year established hundreds of “points of invincibility,” where residents hard-pressed by the war could warm up, recharge their cellphones and get food.Prosecutors said the Russians attacked with S-300 anti-aircraft missiles. The civilians who died were refugees, according to Donetsk Gov. Pavlo Kyrylenko.As the mostly artillery war of the winter months stretches into its second spring, Russian forces also used air-launched missiles, exploding drones and gliding bombs to attack several regions, Ukrainian air force spokesman Yurii Ihnat said.Two civilians were killed and nine were wounded in the town of Bilopillia in Sumy province by an overnight rocket and artillery barrage and airstrikes, officials in the northeastern region said.In southern Ukraine, Russian shelling killed one person in the city of Kherson and killed another person and wounded four others in the town of Bilozerka. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited that region Thursday.Ukrainian forces are poised to use the arrival of warmer weather and new weapons from the West, including tanks, for a counteroffensive aimed at dislodging Russian troops from occupied areas.But Dmitry Medvedev, Russia’s former president and now deputy head of the country's Security Council chaired by President Vladimir Putin, said its forces were ready to repel a counterattack.“Our General Staff is assessing all that,” Medvedev said.He added that any Ukrainian attempt to seize Crimea, which Russia illegally annexed in 2014, could trigger a nuclear response from Moscow.“An attempt to split part of the state away means an encroachment at the very existence of the state,” he said. “Quite obviously, it warrants the use of any weapons. I hope our ‘friends’ across the ocean realize that.”Medvedev is known for frequent bombastic pronouncements, but his warning also stems from Russia's security doctrine envisioning the use of its atomic arsenal in response to a nuclear attack or one with conventional weapons that threatens “the very existence of the Russian state.”Medvedev also said that Western experts operating weapons, such as the U.S.-made Patriot air defense missile systems supplied to Ukraine, could be targeted. Ukrainian soldiers have received training in the U.S., although Russian officials frequently claim that foreign instructors are in Ukraine.“If Patriot or other weapons are delivered to the territory of Ukraine along with foreign experts, they certainly make legitimate targets, which must be destroyed,” Medvedev said in video posted to his messaging app channel. “They are combatants, they are the enemies of our state and they must be destroyed.”“They must understand that as soon as an American or a Polish soldier shows up there, he must be killed,” he added.The Kremlin wants to create a ""sanitary cordon” of up to 100 kilometers (60 miles) around Russian-held areas so short- and medium-range weapons can't hit them, Medvedev said.Moscow may even try to grab a chunk of Ukrainian territory stretching all the way to Polish border, he said.Also Friday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov welcomed Denmark’s plans to invite the operator of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipelines to join a mission to recover an object discovered near the pipeline damaged in an explosion in September. There is still no accepted explanation for the sabotage on the Russia-to-Germany pipelines.“This investigation should be transparent and inclusive from the standpoint of involvement of all parties concerned,” he said, adding that the object was located near a pipe weld, the most vulnerable section of a pipeline on the Baltic seabed.___Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine: https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845947,"Crusaders beat ACT, Chiefs still unbeaten in Super Rugby","WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — Leicester Fainga’anuku scored two tries Friday to bring his tally to five in his last two matches as the Crusaders produced a 35-17 win over the previously unbeaten ACT Brumbies in Super Rugby Pacific.In a later match, the Hamilton, New Zealand-based Chiefs remained the only unbeaten side with a 24-14 win over the New South Wales Waratahs in Sydney.The win was a gift from the Christchurch-based Crusaders to their head coach, and soon-to-be All Blacks, Scott Robertson.Robertson was named this week as the next All Blacks head coach, to replace Ian Foster after the World Cup in France in October. He might have been pleased with the result in Christchurch if not the performance: The Crusaders dropped a lot of ball and made several other unusual errors.He would have noted Fainga’anuku’s performance, which adds to the depth of talent available to the All Blacks on the wing.The winger scored a try in each half and both from the same set move off a lineout. Hooker Codie Taylor threw to the lineout in the sixth minute, looped around the back to take the scrumhalf’s pass and fired a short pass to Fainga’anuku, who crashed through three tackles to score.The Crusaders repeated the move in the 58th. Taylor again passed to Fainga’anuku and the big, powerful winger waded and twisted his way through tackles to score.Taylor scored the vital try himself. The Brumbies had driven over the Crusaders’ line just before the halftime siren sounded and the referee ruled that he had called for the goalline drop out before time expired.The Crusaders were able to play on, regain possession, force a lineout near the Brumbies line and drive Taylor over to lead 21-3 at the break.With Fainga’anuku’s try and another just before fulltime for Christian Lio-Willie, the Crusaders took a bonus point from a win by five tries to two.The Brumbies were under-strength, having left several Wallabies players at home to rest under Rugby Australia’s guidelines for test players in a test World Cup year.They were outplayed in the first half by the Crusaders, who dominated scrums in the absence of Brumbies captain James Slipper and whose fast line speed on defense upset the Brumbies’ attack.But the Brumbies were better in the second half, hitting the defensive line harder and creating ruptures that lead to tries for scrumhalf Ryan Longergan and winger Corey Toole. Toole’s try cut the Crusaders’ lead to 28-17 but the later try from Lio-Willie snuffed out their chances.“Regardless of who turned up tonight we knew the Brumbies were going to front up, especially with their set piece and breakdown work,” Crusaders captain Scott Barrett said. “I’m just proud of our boys, they aced it. “The Chiefs and Waratahs were level at 7-7 at halftime before the visiting team pulled away in the second half. Winger Emoni Narawa scored two tries for the Chiefs, including a 54-minute effort that gave the team a 17-7 lead.A runaway 40-meter intercept try by Waratahs captain Jake Gordon in the 17th minute offset an early cross from Chiefs five-eighth Bryn Gatland.Michael Hooper, in his 133rd Super Rugby game, making the flanker the most-capped Waratahs back-rower, gave his side hope when he finished off a driving maul try on the hour. But Narawa’s second try five minutes from fulltime sealed victory for the Chiefs.___More AP rugby: https://apnews.com/hub/rugby and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845948,King Charles' state visit deflated as France leg canceled,"LONDON (AP) — King Charles III’s international debut was deflated Friday when his trip to France was postponed indefinitely because of protests that threatened to mar events at high profile venues such as the Arc de Triomphe and the Palace of Versailles.While Charles will still travel to Germany on Wednesday, the decision to bypass France removes some of the sparkle from his first overseas trip as monarch, originally planned as a six-day, celebration of Britain’s links with its biggest European allies.But with protesters promising to target royal events as they demonstrate against French President Emmanuel Macron’s plans to raise the retirement age, planners had little choice but to cancel a visit that could have embarrassed the king.“It is a great shame because it was the first state visit of the king’s reign and much thought would have been given as to who should have that honor,” said Joe Little, managing editor of Majesty magazine.Macron said Friday that he had asked for the visit to be delayed out of “common sense and friendship” because the likelihood of protests created a “detestable situation.” Buckingham Palace said Charles and Camilla, the queen consort, would travel to France “as soon as dates can be found.”But decoupling the two visits dilutes one of the original goals of the trip — highlighting the British government’s efforts to improve relations with the European Union after six years of squabbling over Brexit.The French leg of the tour, in particular, was an opportunity for Britain to underscore the progress Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has made after the antagonism fanned by his predecessors, Liz Truss and Boris Johnson, said Ed Owens, an expert on Britain’s royal family who lives in France.During his six months in office, Sunak has reached an agreement with the EU to resolve the long-running dispute over post-Brexit trading rules for Northern Ireland and signed a deal with Macron to try to stop migrants from crossing the English Channel in flimsy inflatable boats.“What we would have seen with this visit, ideally, was the two heads of state of two democracies coming together in recognition of their shared values, their desire to work together, to cooperate,” Owens said. “And at a time when there is war in Eastern Europe, at a time when we are witnessing the rise of an authoritarian China, that kind of symbolism … is powerful.”But postponing the trip was the “least bad option” amid protests that have disrupted public services and left the streets of Paris choked with uncollected garbage, said Owens, author of the “The Family Firm: Monarchy, Mass Media and the British Public, 1932-1953.Demonstrators had said they intended to protest at royal events, including the welcoming ceremony at the Arc de Triomphe and a state dinner at the palace of Versailles. In addition, labor unions have called for nationwide strikes and protests on Tuesday, which would have complicated security and travel arrangements for the royal couple’s trip to the western city of Bordeaux that day.That meant the new monarch’s first big overseas trip would have played out against an ugly backdrop, said Robert Lacey, a historian and author of several books on the royal family. The risk for Charles was that an event designed to highlight his importance as Britain’s head of state could instead have made him look weak and insensitive toward the concerns of French workers.As an example of how important the optics of such visits can be, Lacey drew a parallel with Prince William and the Princess of Wales' tour of the Caribbean last year, which was marred by images of people of color restrained by a chain link fence as the royal couple walked past.The royals, in essence, need state visits to be accompanied by adoring crowds to show that they are being welcomed by the host nation. That couldn’t be guaranteed in France.“The crowd can cheer,” Lacey said. “But the crowd can boo, too.″But all is not lost for Charles.The German portion of the trip is going ahead, and it includes a full schedule of state events and more intimate appearances designed to showcase his role as head of state and highlight the causes he holds dear, like sustainability and the environment, before his coronation on May 6.Charles and Camilla will now start their trip on Wednesday in Berlin, where German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier will welcome them at the historic Brandenburg Gate.On Thursday, the king is scheduled to give a speech to the Bundestag, meet Chancellor Olaf Scholz and talk to Ukrainian refugees and military. He goes to Hamburg on Friday, where he will visit the Kindertransport memorial for Jewish children who fled from Germany to Britain during the Third Reich, and attend a green energy event before returning to the U.K.Speaking before the French leg of the trip was cancelled, royal expert Arianne Chernock said the state visits would help people understand that Charles is now king.“We’re still growing accustomed to Charles in this new role,’’ said Chernock, a professor of modern British history at Boston University. “This visit provides him with that platform to become more familiar to us, to establish himself as King Charles III, and again, in a way that will set the tone for the coronation and demonstrate, I think, that he has a seriousness, a capacity for engaging on really substantive issues that will serve him well, potentially, in his role.”",2023/03/25,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845949,Former Trump advisor says 1 million Taiwanese with AK47s would be strong deterrent,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Former Trump administration National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien said he believes a Taiwan with 1 million AK47-armed citizens on “every corner and in every apartment block” would be a fearful deterrent to a Chinese invasion.Speaking in Taipei on Friday (March 24), O’Brien said he has been on a “listening tour” of Taiwan that began on March 19, meeting Taiwan’s top political leaders from President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) to opposition leader Eric Chu (朱立倫), as well as members of minor parties and “ministers from all the key ministries.” He said the U.S. government will release a bi-partisan report this summer that details findings of the trip and makes recommendations on how to strengthen the U.S.-Taiwan relationship.O’Brien repeatedly said that Taiwan needed to build deterrence if it wanted to avoid conflict with China, saying the best way to avoid a war is through strength. He said that both the U.S. and Taiwan have a role in deterring a Chinese invasion, and that defenses along Taiwan’s China-facing west coast should be improved using the country’s skilled workforce and advanced technology.O’Brien also said that Taiwanese should be firearm trained and this would be a massive deterrent. “Think how rattled it would make the leadership of the CCP if they knew that if they invaded there would be 1 million Taiwanese with an AK47,” he said.O’Brien said he recognized that the culture was different in Taiwan and America, and that guns were a sensitive issue, but did not hold back when expressing his belief in arming Taiwanese citizens, comparing a possible future Chinese invasion of Taiwan to the war in Ukraine. “Those legitimate concerns around gun ownership concerns or gun safety pale in comparison when we look at the war crimes that have taken place,” he said.Safeguards could be put in place to ensure weapons weren’t misused, O’Brien said. He suggested public armories or personal safes could be used to store firearms.Guns are tightly controlled in Taiwan, with a legal amendment allowing Taiwan’s police to fire guns at suspects suspected of using lethal weapons only being passed in October last year.When asked about Honduras’ recent decision to switch diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China, O’Brien said that while there were important benefits gained for Taiwanese from having formal diplomatic allies, Taiwan’s relationship with the U.S. was “far more important.""“As important as diplomatic relations are, the integrity of the country, the anti-corruption stance of the country both in Taiwan and in the U.S. is more important,” he said.O’Brien said the Trump and Biden administrations have both worked with Taiwan and the countries that still maintain diplomatic relations with Taiwan to deter them from switching recognition from China.During O’Brien’s visit, he served as the chair of the Global Taiwan Institute's Task Force on U.S.-Taiwan Relations. The institute is a Washington-based non-profit organization based in Washington D.C. that seeks to enhance the U.S.-Taiwan relationship and produce research and educational programs on Taiwan.",2023/03/24,3438,Politics

I never showed how sad I was, but only cried inside,” said Chen. “When my siblings and I were children, my parents used to buy a cake to celebrate our birthdays. Also, when I was upset or mad, my father would always buy me a cake to calm me down.”All kinds of cakes became Chen’s comfort food. “Feeling happy and comforted are different and I like to tell my customers that things will get better with my cakes,” said Chen.To commemorate her father, Chen said that a whisky-flavored Boston cream pie may be on the way for Father’s Day, as it is her favorite liquor. “But my father only loved beer ...

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845963,Taiwan attacked by supposed guard dog of Australian democracy,"TAICHUNG (Taiwan News) — News media in a free country is the guard dog of democracy, and no exception should be made for opinion pieces contributed by a country whose government is known for orchestrating a propaganda war against other democracies.On Thursday (March 23), a prestigious Australian media outlet published an ""opinion newsletter"" from China's Ambassador to China Xiao Qian (肖千). It had a headline that contained the words ""Taiwan will be ours,"" before later changing it to ""Taiwan is always part of China, but war with Australia is a fallacy.""Running an opinion piece with a different viewpoint is fully acceptable, but it should be buttressed and supported by facts. The Sydney Morning Herald failed spectacularly at this fundamental responsibility.The number of manipulations of what little truth it did contain are staggering and are not something a responsible newspaper should condone. While the Herald did run a rebuttal, the paper ran something straight out of the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) United Front Work Department's cogitative warfare playbook and intended to undermine Australian confidence in a fellow democracy. That is unconscionable.Let’s go over just some of the falsehoods and distortions peddled by Xiao. Let’s start with “Taiwan is part of China’s territory.”By “China” he means the People’s Republic of China (PRC), not the Republic of China (ROC). Taiwan has never been a part of the PRC, and the people and government of Taiwan are determined it never will be. It continues:Taiwan has belonged to China since ancient times. Starting from the Song and Yuan dynasties, the imperial central governments of China all set up administrative bodies to exercise jurisdiction over Penghu and Taiwan.There is a very specific reason he mentions Penghu here, and that is because he’s partly correct when it comes to those islands. There are Song Dynasty (960–1279) records of the islands under the name “Penghu” and in the Mongol Yuan Dynasty (1279–1368) an official presence was established there to handle piracy.That had absolutely nothing to do with Taiwan. Taiwan was firmly under Indigenous control, as it had been for thousands of years.The first foreign power to grab a portion of Taiwan was The Netherlands in the 17th century, and briefly during the same period, a bit of the north was occupied by the Spanish. Ethnic Chinese forces fleeing the incoming Manchurian invasion expelled the Dutch and established a brief Kingdom of Tungning on the southwest coast.Only following the collapse of the Kingdom of Tungning did Taiwan become a part of the Manchurian Qing empire (1644–1912). However, they never managed to control more than two-thirds of Taiwan, which only happened later under the Japanese empire. Xiao continues:In 1885, the Qing government officially established Taiwan as a single province, making it the 20th province of China at the time. In 1895, the defeated Qing government was forced to cede Taiwan and the Penghu Islands to Japan.This is factually true, but it actually undercuts the argument in a way that Xiao probably doesn’t even realise. He included it to fit the “100 years of humiliation” narrative that was in fact largely self-inflicted though weakness brought on by corruption, misrule and civil wars.The part where it undercuts his argument is that Australians are culturally and politically distinct from the United Kingdom, and became an independent country only in 1901. To put this in perspective, debatably, aside from 1945-1949, Taiwan has maintained far fewer cultural or political ties to China since 1895 than Australia did to the U.K.That is a long time and a lot has changed culturally on both sides of the Taiwan Strait. Taiwanese are more culturally different compared with Chinese, than Australians are different from the British.To put that in perspective, while the Chinese were overthrowing the Qing Dynasty, engaging in civil war and then fighting off a Japanese invasion, the Taiwanese were dressed in kimonos. They spoke Japanese and the vast majority of Taiwanese combatants were fighting on the side of the Japanese in World War II.As the Chinese were going through the Great Leap Forward that left millions dead and engaging in the Cultural Revolution, Taiwanese were going to temples and grooving out to ""Hotel California"" by The Eagles in their bellbottom jeans. Xiao continues:The Cairo Declaration issued by China, the United States and the United Kingdom in 1943 stated that it was the purpose of the three allies that all the territories Japan had stolen from China, such as Northeast China, Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, should be restored to China.There are two huge problems with this. If you click on the link to view the Cairo Declaration itself, the first problem is apparent right at the top, as it declares what the statement actually is: A press communique.It is not a treaty or any sort of binding agreement, nor is it signed. It doesn’t even have the force of a memorandum of understanding.The second problem is in the line: “All the territories Japan has stolen from the Chinese, such as Manchuria, Formosa, and the Pescadores, shall be restored to the Republic of China.” Republic of China, not the People’s Republic of China. Xiao then says:In 1945, the Chinese government announced it was resuming the exercise of sovereignty over Taiwan, and the ceremony to accept Japan’s surrender in Taiwan Province of the China war theatre of the Allied powers was held in Taibei (Taipei).This is partially correct, as after World War II Taiwan was officially occupied by the Allied Powers, with the U.S. taking the bulk of the responsibility for the Japanese home islands and the ROC occupying the Colony of Formosa on behalf of the Allies. Xiao goes on to say:From then on, China had recovered Taiwan de jure and de facto through a host of documents with international legal effect.Huh? I dare you, show me one!The Treaty of San Francisco came into force in 1952, with Japan renouncing sovereignty over Taiwan — but without specifying where sovereignty over Taiwan was to go.So, today, many countries, including the United States, hold that sovereignty over Taiwan is “undetermined."" It most certainly doesn’t reside with the People’s Republic of China.Since Xiao’s piece in The Sydney Morning Herald has managed to pack so much nonsense into one piece, we’ll continue this examination in another article.",2023/03/25,2346,Opinion

The missiles did not miss, but hit their target, as the location of their fall was not a coincidence, he said.All democracies need to improve their capability to defend themselves and expand their defense budget. Nobody would help a country which did not make an effort to defend itself, according to Hsieh.Neither surrender nor war were options for Taiwan, as surrender was a dead-end street turning the country into a springboard for Chinese threats against Japan and the U.S., he said.",2023/03/24,4424,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846033,National League West Preview Capsules,"Capsules of National League West teams, listed in order of finish last year:___LOS ANGELES DODGERS2022: 111-51, first place, lost to San Diego in Division Series.Manager: Dave Roberts (eighth season).Opening Day: March 30 vs. Arizona.He’s Here: RHP Noah Syndergaard, OF/DH J.D. Martinez, INF Yonny Hernandez, OF Jason Heyward, RHP Shelby Miller, RHP J.P. Feyereisen.He’s Outta Here: SS Trea Turner, 3B Justin Turner, OF Cody Bellinger, LHP Tyler Anderson, OF Joey Gallo, INF Edwin Rios, OF Kevin Pillar, RHP Trevor Bauer, LHP Andrew Heaney, RHP Tommy Kahnle, RHP Craig Kimbrel, RHP Chris Martin, LHP David Price.Top Hitters: 1B Freddie Freeman (.325, 21 HRs, 100 RBIs, .918 OPS, 117 runs, 47 doubles, 199 hits), OF Mookie Betts (.269, 35, 82, .873 OPS, 117 runs, 40 doubles), C Will Smith (.260, 24, 87, .808 OPS), INF Max Muncy (.196, 21, 69, .713 OPS).Projected Rotation: LH Julio Urías (17-7, 2.16 ERA, 166 Ks), LH Clayton Kershaw (12-3, 2.28), RH Noah Syndergaard (10-10, 3.94 with Angels and Phillies), RH Dustin May (2-3, 4.50 in 6 starts), RH Ryan Pepiot (3-0, 3.47 in 9 games, 7 starts).Key Relievers: LH Alex Vesia (5-0, 2.15 ERA, 1 save, 79Ks), RH Evan Phillips (7-3, 1.14, 2 saves, 77 Ks), RH Brusdar Graterol (2-4, 3.26, 4 saves), RH Shelby Miller (0-1, 6.43, 14 Ks, 7 innings in 4 games with Giants).Outlook: After winning a franchise-record 111 games and then losing in the Division Series, the Dodgers are eager to bounce back with a deep postseason run. However, they’ll start the season with injuries to some key players, mostly in the pitching ranks. SS Gavin Lux (torn right ACL) is out for the year. All-Star RHP Tony Gonsolin (16-1, 2.14 ERA, 199 Ks, all career bests) is on the 15-day injured list with a sprained left ankle. RHP Blake Treinen is on the 60-day IL recovering from right shoulder surgery. RHP Daniel Hudson (torn left ACL) is making progress. All-Star RHP Walker Buehler (Tommy John surgery) could possibly return late in the season. The team lost a big bat in All-Star Trea Turner, who went to Philadelphia. Also gone are stalwarts Justin Turner and Bellinger. The Dodgers were more restrained in the offseason free-agent market than is their reputation and it could signal they are saving money to go after some big names next offseason.___SAN DIEGO PADRES2022: 89-73, second place, lost to Philadelphia in NL Championship Series.Manager: Bob Melvin (second season).Opening Day: March 30 vs. Colorado.He’s Here: SS Xander Bogaerts, RHP MIchael Wacha, RHP Seth Lugo, INF Matt Carpenter, DH Nelson Cruz.He’s Outta Here: LF Jurickson Profar, LHP Sean Manaea, INF Brandon Drury, 1B Josh Bell, RHP Mike Clevinger, RF Wil Myers, RHP Pierce Johnson.Top Hitters: 3B Manny Machado (.298, 32 HRs, 102 RBIs, .898 OPS), SS Xander Bogaerts (.307, 15, 73 with Boston), LF Juan Soto (.242, 27, 62 with Nationals and Padres), RF Fernando Tatis Jr. (.282, NL-high 42, 97, 25 SBs, .965 OPS in 2021; sat out last season due to injuries and suspension), 1B Jake Cronenworth (.239, 17, 88).Projected Rotation: RH Yu Darvish (16-8, 3.10 ERA), RH Joe Musgrove (10-7, 2.93), LH Blake Snell (8-10, 3.38), RH Michael Wacha (11-2, 3.32 with Boston), RH Nick Martinez (4-4, 3.47, 8 saves), RH Seth Lugo (3-2, 3.60 in 62 relief appearances with Mets).Key Relievers: LH Josh Hader (2-5, 5.22 ERA, 36 saves with Brewers and Padres), RH Robert Suarez (5-1, 2.27), RH Luis Garcia (4-6, 3.39), LH Tim Hill (3-0, 3.56).Outlook: The Padres have World Series expectations after a stirring run to the NLCS and an offseason in which owner Peter Seidler has been unafraid to spend big money. The team added Bogaerts on a $280 million, 11-year contract to a lineup that already included Machado and Soto. Tatis can return April 20 when he finishes serving an 80-game suspension for testing positive for a performance-enhancing drug. Tatis, an All-Star at shortstop in 2021, will move to right field and Soto to left. Besides adding Bogaerts, the Padres signed Machado to a new $350 million, 11-year contract and Darvish to a new $108 million, six-year deal.___SAN FRANCISCO GIANTS2022: 81-81, third place.Manager: Gabe Kapler (fourth season).Opening Day: March 30 at New York Yankees.He’s Here: LHP Sean Manaea, OF Mitch Haniger, OF Michael Conforto, RHP Ross Stripling, LHP Taylor Rogers, OF Stephen Piscotty, C Blake Sabol, RHP Luke Jackson.He’s Outta Here: LHP Carlos Rodon, 1B Brandon Belt, RHP Shelby Miller, 3B Evan Longoria, INF Tommy La Stella, LHP Jose Alvarez.Top Hitters: OF Joc Pederson (.274, 23 HRs, 70 RBIs), OF Mitch Haniger (.246, 11, 34 with Mariners), OF Mike Yastrzemski (.214, 17, 57), OF Michael Conforto (.232, 14, 55 in 2021 for Mets), SS Brandon Crawford (.231, 9, 52).Projected Rotation: RH Logan Webb (15-9, 2.90 ERA), RH Alex Cobb (7-8, 3.73), LH Sean Manaea (8-9, 4.96 with Padres), RH Ross Stripling (10-4, 3.01 with Blue Jays), LH Alex Wood (8-12, 5.10).Key Relievers: RH Camilo Doval (6-6, 2.53 ERA, 27/30 saves), LH Taylor Rogers (4-8, 4.76, 31/41 saves with Padres and Brewers), RH Tyler Rogers (3-4, 3.57).Outlook: The Giants dropped by 26 wins from their surprising 2021 season and missed the playoffs last year. After making a run at Aaron Judge in free agency and agreeing to a deal with Carlos Correa that fell through when he failed a physical, San Francisco didn’t make many big impact moves this offseason. But the Giants are hoping that smaller additions like Haniger, Conforto, Manaea, Stripling and Taylor Rogers can get them back into playoff position in the tough NL West.___ARIZONA DIAMONDBACKS2022: 74-88, fourth place.Manager: Torey Lovullo (seventh season).Opening Day: March 30 at Los Angeles Dodgers.He’s Here: C Gabriel Moreno, 3B Evan Longoria, OF Kyle Lewis, OF Lourdes Gurriel Jr., RHP Miguel Castro, RHP Scott McGough, LHP Andrew Chafin, RHP Jeurys Familia, RHP Cole Sulser.He’s Outta Here: C/OF Daulton Varsho, OF Jordan Luplow, C/OF Cooper Hummel, LHP Caleb Smith, RHP Ian Kennedy.Top Hitters: 1B Christian Walker (.242, 36 HRs, 94 RBIs, Gold Glove), 2B Ketel Marte (.240, 12, 52, 42 doubles), OF Corbin Carroll (.260, 4, 14 in 104 ABs), OF Jake McCarthy (.283, 8, 43, 23 SBs), INF Josh Rojas (.269, 9, 56, 23 SBs).Projected Rotation: RH Zac Gallen (12-4, 2.54 ERA), RH Merrill Kelly (13-8, 3.37), LH Madison Bumgarner (7-15, 4.88), RH Zach Davies (2-5, 4.09), RH Drey Jameson (3-0, 1.48 in 4 starts).Key Relievers: RH Mark Melancon (3-10, 4.66 ERA, 18 saves), RH Scott McGough (2-2, 2.35 in Japan), LH Joe Mantiply (2-5, 2.85, All-Star), RH Miguel Castro (5-0, 4.03 with Yankees), RH Cole Sulser (1-4, 5.29 with Marlins), LH Andrew Chafin (2-3, 2.83 with Tigers).Outlook: The Diamondbacks appear to be headed in the right direction with a speedy, young outfield of Carroll, McCarthy and Alek Thomas and a solid top of the rotation that includes Gallen and Kelly. Carroll is among the favorites to win the NL Rookie of the Year award after a stellar 32-game cameo in 2022. Depth is still an issue, particularly in the bullpen. Arizona is hoping to push for the playoffs for the first time since 2017, but it’s an uphill battle in a division that includes the free-spending Dodgers and Padres.___COLORADO ROCKIES2022: 68-94, fifth place.Manager: Bud Black (seventh season).Opening Day: March 30 at San Diego.He’s Here: OF/INF Jurickson Profar, RHP Pierce Johnson, LHP Brad Hand, LHP Brent Suter, RHP Connor Seabold, INF Mike Moustakas.He’s Outta Here: INF/OF Garrett Hampson, OF/INF Connor Joe, RHP Scott Oberg, SS Jose Iglesias, RHP Chad Kuhl, RHP Carlos Estévez, RHP Alex Colomé, OF Sam Hilliard.Top Hitters: 1B C.J. Cron (.257, 29 HRs, 102 RBIs), DH Charlie Blackmon (.264, 16, 78), 2B Ryan McMahon (.246, 20, 67), OF Kris Bryant (.306, 5, 14 in 42 games), OF Randal Grichuk (.259, 19, 73).Projected Rotation: RH Germán Márquez (9-13, 4.95 ERA, 150 Ks), LH Kyle Freeland (9-11, 4.53, 131 Ks), RH José Ureña (3-8, 5.14), LH Austin Gomber (5-7, 5.56, 124 2/3 innings), RH Ryan Feltner (4-9, 5.83) or RH Connor Seabold (0-4, 11.29 with Boston).Key Relievers: RH Daniel Bard (6-4, 1.79 ERA, 34/37 saves), RH Pierce Johnson (1-2, 5.02 with Padres), RH Dinelson Lamet (1-2, 6.12 with Padres and Rockies), LH Brent Suter (5-3, 3.78 with Milwaukee), RH Justin Lawrence (3-1, 5.70), LH Brad Hand (3-2, 2.80, 5 saves with Philadelphia).Outlook: The Rockies are looking to avoid their first 100-loss season. Their projection is 64 1/2 wins, according to FanDuel Sportsbook. Colorado has been dealing with injury after injury this spring. Second baseman Brendan Rodgers is expected to miss the bulk of the season after sustaining a shoulder injury diving for a grounder in a game. Colorado outfielder Sean Bouchard also will miss significant time due to a biceps rupture. Relief pitcher Lucas Gilbreath underwent Tommy John surgery and will miss the season. Colorado is counting on a return to form from Bryant, who didn’t hit a homer at Coors Field in an injury-marred season. Bryant is likely to switch from left to right field with the arrival of Profar from San Diego. Grichuk has been sidelined since undergoing surgery for a sports hernia in mid-February. Márquez and Freeland anchor the rotation. Bard was dependable in the closer’s role last year.___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846034,Deutsche Bank shares drop amid global jitters over banks,"FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — Shares in Deutsche Bank fell sharply Friday, dragging down other major European banks and leading German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to express confidence in the country’s largest lender after fears about the global financial system sent fresh shudders through the market.Deutsche Bank shares closed down 8.5% on the German stock exchange after falling as much as 14%. That followed a steep rise in the cost to insure bondholders against the bank defaulting on its debts, known as credit default swaps.Rising costs on insuring debt were also a prelude to Swiss lender Credit Suisse's government-backed rescue by rival UBS. That hastily arranged takeover Sunday aimed to stem the upheaval in the global financial system after the collapse of two U.S. banks and jitters about Credit Suisse's long-running troubles led its shares to tank and customers to pull out their money.Asked whether Deutsche Bank could be the next Credit Suisse, Scholz said, “There is no reason to worry.”“Deutsche Bank has thoroughly modernized and reorganized its business and is a very profitable bank,” Scholz said after a European Union summit in Brussels.Like Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank is one of 30 globally significant financial institutions, with international rules requiring it to hold higher levels of capital reserves because its failure could cause widespread losses.Other major European banks also fell Friday, with Germany's Commerzbank closing down 5.45%, France's Societe Generale off 6%, and Austria’s Raiffeisen down 7.9%.Markets have been rattled by fears that other banks may have unexpected troubles like U.S.-based Silicon Valley Bank, which went under after customers pulled their money and it suffered uninsured losses because of higher interest rates.Credit Suisse's troubles, including a $5.5 billion loss on dealings with a private investment fund, predated the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, but depositors and investors fled after the U.S. failures focused less-friendly attention on banks and a key Credit Suisse investor refused to put up more money.Deutsche Bank has turned in 10 straight quarters of profit, including 5.7 billion euros ($6.1 billion) last year, improving its fortunes under CEO Christian Sewing.Before that, the bank went through a long stretch of low profitability and troubles with regulators going back to the 2008 global financial crisis, including a $7.2 billion penalty from U.S. authorities for misleading buyers of complex mortgage-backed securities that later went sour.Despite the rebound under Sewing, the bank was “a natural candidate” for a market selloff because of its previous troubles, large, sometimes complex holdings and market skepticism about its future profits, said Sascha Steffen, professor of finance at the Frankfurt School of Finance & Management.The market values the bank at less than the assets on its balance sheet, he said: “That means investors are still very worried about what are the risks that the bank has on its balance sheet or its earnings potential going forward, and that’s not good.""Big global banks have sold off more than smaller ones in recent financial turmoil, he said.“It’s contagion — it’s lack of confidence, a lack of trust,"" Steffen said.The selloff “might also be more emotionally driven, so to speak, rather than based on facts, but this is something that had to be expected"" based on its history and performance after the global financial crisis, he said.Davide Oneglia at investment strategy research provider TS Lombard said it wasn't surprising that “the next bank in the firing line is now Deutsche Bank."" It was associated with Credit Suisse in the past because of ""managerial/strategic failures and involvement in many financial scandals” despite its recent profits.“Whether this is just a reflection of investors’ anxiety at the end of a very stressful week, some technical market factor, or signs of more problems to come for the weakest European banks, it’s still too early to say,” he said.However, the selloff of European bank shares “continues to appear more related to lack of confidence than fundamentals.”Stuart Graham and Leona Li, analysts at global financial research firm Autonomous, said that “Deutsche is in robust shape.”“We are relatively relaxed in view of Deutsche’s robust capital and liquidity positions,” they said.Its holdings of derivatives — often complex investments whose price is tied to other assets — are “well known” and “just not very scary, in our view,” Graham and Li said.European officials say banks in the European Union's regulatory system — which doesn't include Credit Suisse — are resilient and have no direct exposure to Silicon Valley and little to Credit Suisse.Efforts to strengthen banking regulation in recent years “puts us all in a position to say that European banking supervision and the financial system are robust and stable and that we have resilient capitalization of European banks,” Scholz said.European leaders, who played down any risk of a possible banking crisis at a summit Friday, say the financial system is in good shape because they require broad adherence to tougher requirements to keep ready cash on hand to cover deposits.International negotiators agreed to those rules following the 2008 global financial crisis triggered by the failure of U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers. U.S. regulators exempted midsize banks, including Silicon Valley Bank, from those safeguards.The reassurances, however, have not stopped investors from selling the shares amid more general concerns about how global banks will weather the current climate of rising interest rates.Though higher interest rates should increase bank profits by boosting what they can earn over what they pay on deposits, some long-term investments can sharply lose value and cause losses unless the banks took precautions to hedge those investments.___AP reporter Geir Moulson contributed from Berlin.",2023/03/25,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846035,Why does US see Chinese-owned TikTok as a security threat?,"BEIJING (AP) — U.S. lawmakers have grilled TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew about data security and harmful content, with some pushing to ban the popular short-video app nationwide.Chew, a native of Singapore, told the lawmakers that TikTok prioritizes user safety as he sought to avert a U.S. ban on the app by downplaying its ties to China.Both Republican and Democratic representatives aggressively questioned Chew on topics including TikTok’s content moderation practices, its data security plans, and past spying on journalists.Here's a look at some of the concerns about TikTok and its ownership.WHY DOES WASHINGTON SAY TIKTOK IS A THREAT?TikTok, which has over 150 million American users, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Chinese technology firm ByteDance Ltd., which appoints its executives.ByteDance is based in Beijing but registered in the Cayman Islands, as is common for privately owned Chinese companies. Its headquarters is in Beijing’s northwestern Haidian district, home to key universities and a hub for tech startups. TikTok has dual headquarters in Singapore and Los Angeles.Founded by Chinese entrepreneur Zhang Yiming in 2012, ByteDance is said to be valued at around $220 billion — nearly half of its 2021 valuation of $400 billion. Publicly traded Chinese tech companies and privately held ones like ByteDance have plunged in value since the ruling Communist Party tightened control over the industry with anti-monopoly and data security crackdowns.Western governments worry Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over TikTok data on American users, exposing sensitive information. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said Friday that China's government has never and will not ask companies to “collect or provide data, information or intelligence"" held in foreign countries, adding the U.S. ""has not provided any evidence so far to prove that TikTok threatens U.S. national security.""ByteDance says 60% of its shares are owned by non-Chinese investors such as U.S investment firms Carlyle Group and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Japan's SoftBank Group. Employees own 20% and its founders the remaining 20%.Some details of the relationship between TikTok and ByteDance remain unclear to outsiders.WHAT CHINESE RULES WORRY WESTERN GOVERNMENTS?China's 2017 National Intelligence Law states that “any organization"" must assist or cooperate with state intelligence work while a separate 2014 Counter-Espionage Law says “relevant organizations ... may not refuse"" to collect evidence for an investigation.Since ByteDance, which owns TikTok, is a Chinese company, it would likely have to abide by these rules if Chinese authorities asked it to turn over data.Laws and regulations are only one aspect of the Communist Party’s pervasive control. There are no legal limits on the party’s powers. The authorities also can threaten to cancel licenses, conduct regulatory or tax investigations and use other penalties to compel compliance by Chinese and foreign companies operating in China.The party sometimes conveys orders using “window guidance,” or informal communication in private. It has used crackdowns to tighten control over technology companies and force them to align with its goals.The Chinese government has also sought more direct control over companies by getting seats on boards of directors.MUST TIKTOK TURN OVER DATA IF THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT SAYS SO, EVEN WITH “ PROJECT TEXAS?”TikTok has promised to protect data on American users by storing it on servers operated by an outside contractor, Oracle Corp., in what’s known as “Project Texas.” Chew, the TikTok CEO, said all new U.S. user data is stored in the United States and the company should finish deleting older U.S. data from non-Oracle servers this year.The fear is that ByteDance would have to hand over information it obtained from TikTok if ordered to do so by Chinese authorities, but Chew has said Project Texas will put U.S. data out of China's reach.ByteDance disclosed in December that four employees gained access to data about reporters and people connected to them while looking for how information about the company was leaked. Chew told the lawmakers China-based ByteDance employees may still have access to some U.S. data but that won't be the case once Project Texas is complete.In November, TikTok’s head of privacy for Europe said some employees in China had access to information about users in Britain and the European Union.DOES THE COMMUNIST PARTY HAVE ANY INFLUENCE ON BYTEDANCE?In Thursday’s hearing, lawmakers repeatedly tried to pin down Chew on whether ByteDance had links to China’s communist rulers.He deflected questions about whether staff and top executives are Communist Party members.“I do know that the founder himself is not a member of the Communist Party, but we don’t know the political affiliation of our employees because that’s not something we ask,” Chew said.When questioned whether ByteDance was effectively controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, Chew said he disagreed.After a lawmaker said the Communist Party holds a “golden share” in ByteDance that allows it to control one ByteDance board seat, Chew said, “That’s not correct.”In China, so-called golden shares held by official investment funds are one way for Beijing to gain more oversight over business by giving them a 1% stake in companies.Chew pushed back when lawmakers claimed that the Communist Party owns shares in ByteDance that give it a vote in how the company is run. “The Communist Party doesn’t have voting rights in ByteDance,” Chew said.ByteDance’s main Chinese subsidiary is the license-holder for some of its video and information platforms that only serve the China market.WHAT IS DOUYIN AND WHAT IS TIKTOK'S RELATIONSHIP WITH IT?Douyin is ByteDance’s short-video platform for the China market. It's similar to TikTok, but its content is restricted by Chinese censorship rules that prohibit material deemed subversive or pornographic - a point emphasized by U.S. lawmakers worried about harmful content viewed by young people.The Communist Party’s extensive internet filters block most users in China from seeing TikTok. ByteDance has said TikTok has “no affiliation” with Beijing ByteDance Technology Co., the subsidiary that operates Douyin; Toutiao, a news and short-video platform, and other services.HOW DID CHINA REACT TO THE TIKTOK CEO'S WASHINGTON TESTIMONY?Most of the social media reaction in China was sympathetic to Chew, with praise for how he handled the hostile questions lobbed at him.Comments on Douyin and microblogging platform Weibo were critical of U.S. lawmakers for asking Chew leading or “trap” questions. Many commenters used a Chinese saying that means “If you want to accuse someone, there's always a way.""___Associated Press Business Writer Kelvin Chan in London contributed to this report.",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846036,Ukraine pushes for continued Russian Olympic exclusion,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine renewed its push to keep Russian athletes out of the Olympics on Friday ahead of an International Olympic Committee board meeting next week which is expected to set the framework for their return to international sports events.Vadym Guttsait, who is Ukraine's sports minister and leads the national Olympic committee, was sharply critical of the IOC's push to reintegrate Russia and its ally Belarus into world sports. Any return, Guttsait said, would highlight the inequality caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine.“We do not have normal conditions for training and preparation for the Olympic Games. At the same time, the Russians have all the essentials to train and perform inside their country. They sleep at night, but we don’t sleep at night,” he told reporters.The IOC is expected to set out criteria for Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete next week as qualifying events for the Paris Olympics ramp up. The IOC recommended excluding Russia and Belarus on safety grounds soon after the invasion last year but now argues for letting the two countries’ athletes compete as neutrals without national symbols. The IOC says a continued exclusion amounts to discrimination on the basis of citizenship.IOC president Thomas Bach said Wednesday that it would resist political influence in sports and indicated that next week’s meeting could discuss issues including Russian athletes’ military links. The IOC has said it would seek to bar athletes who have “actively supported” the war but hasn't said how exactly that process would work. Ukraine is especially concerned about the many Russian athletes who are serving members of the armed forces or who represent military-run sports clubs.“If there will be very weak criteria, then what was the point of suspending Russia (a year ago), to bring it back now, in the run-up to the Olympic Games?"" Guttsait said.Guttsait reiterated Ukraine's earlier vow that it could consider boycotting the Paris Olympics in protest, but only as a “last resort” if lobbying efforts fail.“We want to participate in the Olympic Games, but without Russians and Belarusians,"" he said. ""Regarding whether we will participate or not, it will be, you know, not going to the Olympic Games that will be considered as a last resort by all our federations and all our athletes. But, of course, we will definitely need to hear the opinion of each of our athletes and each of our federations and make this decision together.”Guttsait won an Olympic gold medal in fencing — Bach's old sport — at the 1992 Olympics, where he was a teammate with Stanislav Pozdnyakov, now the Russian Olympic Committee president.Russia has welcomed efforts to readmit its athletes but has demanded they are allowed to compete under their own flag and national anthem.The IOC is leaving final decisions on whether to readmit Russians and Belarusians to the federations which govern individual sports. Despite calls from Bach for a unified approach, there is a growing split.Fencing and judo have both allowed Russians and Belarusians to resume competing this year — though neither country has done so. There were cases last year of Ukrainian athletes boycotting events rather than facing Russians in fencing and judo.Track and field kept its ban in place for the “foreseeable future” on Thursday. The IOC said in an emailed statement Friday it has “taken note” of that decision and that it was under the “sole authority” of track's governing body, World Athletics. Ice hockey has barred Russia and Belarus from the 2024 world championships citing security concerns.Other sports take different approaches.In tennis, the men's and women's tours allow individual Russians and Belarusians to keep playing as neutrals but bar them from national team events like the Davis Cup and Billie Jean King Cup. Ukrainian player Marta Kostyuk has refused to shake hands with Russian and Belarusian opponents and sobbed after beating Russian Varvara Gracheva for a title in Austin this month.Soccer authorities excluded Russia from qualifying for the men's and women's World Cups and from qualifying for the men's European Championship, which began this week, but allow Belarus to compete at neutral venues without crowds.___More AP coverage of the Paris Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/25,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846037,Review: Broadway's 'Bad Cinderella' gets lost in the woods,"As you settle into your seat at Broadway's “Bad Cinderella,” the subtle sound of piped-in birdsong greets you. Enjoy it while you can. The next few hours will be a frantic onslaught.The show that opened Thursday at the Imperial Theatre is a hyped-up, over-caffeinated fractured fairy tale that loses its way in the forest and wastes some of the nicest melodies Andrew Lloyd Webber has written in decades. It's lewd and smugly arch and increasingly tiresome.The titular star — a fine Linedy Genao — plays a so-called rebel in the beauty-obsessed town of Belleville, set somewhere in a France that has bikini waxes and also swordsmen. She doesn't wash her hair, eschews manicures and even spray-paints “Beauty Sucks” on a statue of Prince Charming. What a rebel! She is clearly the creation of old people.The book by Emerald Fennell nominally tries to argue that conformity and surfaces are the enemy but doesn't have the verve to finish that argument, ending up with a musical that would have been mildly progressive in 1995.The lyrics by David Zippel can be seen coming a mile away. He’s the kind of guy who rhymes “Cinderella” with “salmonella” and “fault” with “assault.” Director Laurence Connor pitches everything at 11, a never-ending streak of ruffles, pectoral muscles and power singing.The tone is set early, with a trio of milkmaids in low-cut costumes offering dairy that has been “squeezed by my hand” and a shirtless baker screaming “Hot buns! Check out my hot buns!” It sort of undercuts the show's theme of empowerment when much of the material seems cribbed from a middle school boy's imagination.In this tale, the evil stepsisters act like Valley Girl airheads, the Godmother performs plastic surgery to make people look better and we have two princes — Charming, a “man's man” who is “hot enough to blister” and his brother Sebastian, a “human sleeping pill.”Broadway is awash with royalty these days, from “Six” to “Aladdin,” “The Lion King” to “Camelot” — and fairy tales were just on with “Into the Woods.” “Bad Cinderella” pilots a rocky course by wanting to tell a princess story with a non-conformist who then conforms.Being British, it naturally also reveals a ton of psychodrama when it comes to royalty, ripping the institution whenever it can, from breeding and privilege to perhaps a dig at more recent events: “Nothing like the marriage of a prince to a commoner to give the illusion of equality and stop people getting all revolution-y.”One bright spot is Carolee Carmello, who is simply perfection as the evil stepmother, rattling off insults with aplomb — “Gain one more ounce and you'll be disowned!” — and offering a great duet with the queen, “I Know You.” Other standout songs include “Only You, Lonely You” and “Unfair.” But “Far Too Late” never seems to end and the trio singing “Moment of Triumph” step on each other.There's just too much here, from the over-the-top costumes to cast members milling in the audience, to the fog machine going into overdrive to men twerking onstage to a uselessly detailed map of Belleville slipped into the Playbill. “Oh my God, do you ever stop?” a prince even at one point asks Cinderella.This is a musical that simply outstays its welcome, unable to finish, or as it likes to repeatedly joke, have a “happy ending.” You will long for the sound of birdsong.___Mark Kennedy is at http://twitter.com/KennedyTwits",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846038,Much of drought-plagued West Coast faces salmon fishing ban,"SAN DIEGO (AP) — As drought dried up rivers that carry California’s newly hatched Chinook salmon to the ocean, state officials in recent years resorted to loading up the fish by the millions onto trucks and barges to take them to the Pacific.The surreal and desperate scramble boosted the survival rate of the hatchery-raised fish, but still it was not enough to reverse the declining stocks in the face of added challenges. River water temperatures rose with warm weather, and a Trump-era rollback of federal protections for waterways allowed more water to be diverted to farms. Climate change, meanwhile, threatens food sources for the young Chinook maturing in the Pacific.Now, ocean salmon fishing season is set to be prohibited this year off California and much of Oregon for the second time in 15 years after adult fall-run Chinook, often known as king salmon, returned to California's rivers in near record-low numbers in 2022.“There will be no wild-caught California salmon to eat unless someone has still got some vacuum sealed last year in their freezer,” said John McManus of the Golden State Salmon Association.Experts fear native California salmon, which make up a significant portion of the Pacific Northwest’s fishing industry, are in a spiral toward extinction. Much of the salmon caught off Oregon originate in California's Klamath and Sacramento rivers. After hatching in freshwater, they spend three years on average maturing in the Pacific, where many are snagged by commercial fishermen, before migrating back to their spawning grounds, where conditions are more ideal to give birth. After laying eggs, they die.Already California's spring-run Chinook are listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act, while winter-run Chinook are endangered along with the Central California Coast coho salmon, which has been off-limits to California commercial fishers since the 1990s.The Pacific Fishery Management Council, the authority responsible for setting ocean salmon seasons off the Pacific coast, is expected in early April to formally approve its proposed closure of Chinook fishing along the coast from Cape Falcon in northern Oregon to the California-Mexico border. Salmon season is expected to open as usual north of Cape Falcon, including in the Columbia River and off Washington’s coast.Though the closure will deal a blow to the industry that supports tens of thousands of jobs, few are disputing it.“We want to make sure they are here for the future,” said third-generation fisherman Garin McCarthy, who described catching a Chinook as “magical.”McCarthy, whose entire income last year came from salmon fishing off both California and Oregon, has had to invest thousands of dollars in equipment to fish other species like rockfish, halibut and black cod.“We’re all scrambling to try to make our boats do something different,” he said. “We’re all salmon trollers. That’s what we do. That’s what we live for.”Glen Spain, executive director of the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen’s Associations, said he believes the ban might need to be in place for two or three years to bring back sustainable stocks after many fish died in 2020, the start of a record-dry period.The Chinook already faced challenges, with dams blocking their historic retreats to the chilly upper reaches of Northern California’s Sacramento River and the Klamath River along the California-Oregon border. Decades of development have disrupted the natural flow of rivers and polluted waters.In 2020, the Trump administration ended federal protections for millions of waterways, allowing for more water to be pumped out of the Sacramento River Basin for farming despite warnings from biologists that it could harm salmon runs in the future.Fishers say river water temperatures increased with the diversions for irrigation, killing more eggs and hatchlings and preventing the stocks from bouncing back amid the drought.“This one ain’t on us,"" said Bob Maharry, 68, a lifelong San Francisco-based fisherman. “This has nothing to do with overfishing. This is poor management of water.”The California Department of Fish and Wildlife said the estimated number of adult fall Chinook expected to return to spawn in the Sacramento River this year is less than 170,000, one of the lowest forecasts since the current assessment method began in 2008. Fewer than 104,000 fall Chinook are likely to return to the Klamath River, the second lowest estimate since 1997.In 2021, a judge determined the Trump administration improperly limited federal protections and restored them to a narrower 1986 standard. The Biden administration is expected to expand the protections in 2024.Some are banking on the unusually wet winter to bring relief. Record rain and snowfall since late last year have freed two-thirds of California from drought. But too much water could also flush out eggs and hatchlings.Businesses tied to salmon want the government to declare the situation a federal disaster so they may receive aid. As the market shrinks, more restaurants turn to farm-raised salmon, while gear suppliers stop stocking the proper equipment to fish Chinook.“Not everybody is going to make it out of this type of a closure unfortunately,” said Andy Giuliano, who owns Fish Emeryville, a bait-and-tackle shop and booking service for 16 charter boats that offer salmon fishing trips to tourists in the San Francisco Bay area. “It’s a real stress test on the industry.""Eric Schindler, Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife’s ocean salmon project leader, said he “was not expecting it to be this drastic,” assuming the year would bring restrictions but not a full closure for most of Oregon.Jeff Reeves, who has been salmon fishing from the Coos Bay, Oregon, area since the 1970s and is also a member of the Oregon Salmon Commission, said he plans to fish rockfish, black cod and maybe tuna. Later this year he plans to target coho salmon from Oregon, which is doing well enough to be fished unlike the coho in California. But it won’t make up for the loss of the Chinook, which are bigger, fattier fish that are in higher demand.“It’s devastating,"" he said. ""The Oregon fleet is already on life support,"" which dropped from a height of about 4,500 boats to about 180 today, he added.On a stretch of the Klamath River in Northern California, the Yurok tribe has watched for years the decimation of the culturally significant salmon population. Barry McCovey Jr., director of the tribe's fisheries department, said the tribe's Chinook allotment is likely to be very small this year.Still, he is hopeful the planned removal of four dams on the Klamath River will improve the fish's future.“It’s not a silver bullet, but a big step in right direction,” McCovey said. “There’s still a lot of battles to fight if we want to have coho and Chinook.”__Baumann reported from Seattle.",2023/03/24,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846064,Kimmich praises Nagelsmann amid reports Bayern coach out,"FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — Bayern Munich midfielder Joshua Kimmich praised Julian Nagelsmann as an “outstanding” coach Friday amid reports that the 35-year-old manager is set to be fired and replaced by Thomas Tuchel.Both Kicker magazine and German tabloid Bild reported Thursday that Bayern was ending Nagelsmann’s spell in charge following the team’s 2-1 loss at Bayer Leverkusen in the Bundesliga on Sunday.""I can only say that Julian Nagelsmann is an outstanding coach. Really, I've had a lot of coaches and a lot of top coaches and despite that I'd say he's easily in the top three of my best coaches,” Kimmich told reporters Friday as he prepares to captain Germany in a friendly against Peru on Saturday. “As things stand at the moment, you can surely understand that I can't say anything” about the reports, he added.Germany coach Hansi Flick, who was Nagelsmann's predecessor at Bayern, said he was “very surprised” to see reports saying Nagelsmann would be removed.Bayern's defeat to Leverkusen dropped Bayern to second place in the Bundesliga, one point behind Borussia Dortmund before the teams clash in Munich in the “Klassker” on April 1.The Associated Press has asked Bayern for comment but the club has yet to make a statement about the situation.Kicker reported that Bayern is in touch with Tuchel and that the German coach is expected to join Friday or Saturday. Tuchel led Chelsea to the Champions League title in 2021 and previously coached Paris Saint-Germain — losing the 2020 Champions League final to Bayern — and Dortmund.Bayern faces Manchester City in the Champions League quarterfinals on April 11.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/24,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846066,Former rebel leader is named Congo's new Defense Minister,"KINSHASA, Congo (AP) — Congo's former rebel leader jailed by the International Criminal Court, Jean-Pierre Bemba, has been appointed Congo's Defense Minister and Deputy Prime Minister in a Cabinet reshuffle.Bemba's appointment to the key positions was announced Thursday evening on state television by President Felix Tshisekedi's spokeswoman. Bemba's promotion and other Cabinet appointments come less than a year ahead of Congo's presidential elections.Congo's former vice president between 2003 and 2006, Bemba was later imprisoned by the ICC for more than a decade, accused of murders, rapes and pillaging committed by his Movement for the Liberation of Congo forces in the neighboring country of Central African Republic. In a surprising ruling, he was acquitted by the ICC in 2018. Bemba has always maintained his innocence.Bemba's return to prominent government positions comes nine months ahead of Congo's presidential elections scheduled for December. Bemba's political comeback was likely decided to help Tshisekedi win votes in Congo's war-torn northeast, where Bemba's rebel group was popular in the 1990s and 2000s, say analysts.“This is clearly a pre-election reshuffle and Jean-Pierre Bemba has been appointed to bring his supporters in line to rally behind the president ahead of the race,” said Benjamin Hunter, Africa analyst for Verisk Maplecroft, a risk assessment firm.“Despite Bemba’s previous imprisonment by the ICC, he is a political heavyweight with the patronage networks and contact book to help Tshisekedi’s election campaign,” he said.Conflict in eastern Congo has been simmering for decades with more than 120 armed groups fighting for power, land, resources and some to defend their communities. Tshisekedi came to office in 2019 promising to stem Congo's instability and violence, but it's only increased.Other new government postings in the Cabinet reshuffle include Tshisekedi’s former chief of staff, Vital Kamerhe, who was named the minister of the economy.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846068,In Your Debt: Doing the bare minimum with debt can cost you,"When you’re carrying a credit card balance, paying at least the minimum due each month is certainly a start. If those payments aren’t making your overall budget feel squeezed, you have all the more reason to put payments on autopilot and not think about the total cost of your debt.“Our pace of life has gotten really busy,” says Delia Fernandez, a certified financial planner and the founder and president of Fernandez Financial Advisory LLC in Los Alamitos, California. “There’s always something that’s more important, particularly for these people who are not in a financial crisis.”But that inertia can cost you, especially with average credit card interest rates reaching 20.4% as of November 2022, according to the Federal Reserve. NerdWallet’s 2022 American Household Credit Card Debt Study, conducted by Harris Poll, found that U.S. households with revolving credit card debt are paying an average of $1,380 in interest this year.There is good news, though: Dedicating even a small amount of time and money to changing up your payment habits can be well worth the effort.CONSIDER THE TOTAL — NOT MONTHLY — COST OF INTERESTWhile the slow drip of interest payments might feel manageable month to month, thinking of your debt this way ignores how much interest adds up over time.“If you’re only able to make minimum payments and you’re paying the average interest rate, it could cost you thousands over many, many years if you’re paying down a balance of $10,000,” says Bruce McClary, senior vice president of membership and communications at the National Foundation for Credit Counseling. “It’s stunning how much it could cost you.”Since minimum credit card payments are generally around 2% of the total amount owed, you’d make $200 monthly payments on that $10,000 balance, and your interest rate is 20.4%. It’ll take around nine and a half years to become debt-free, and you’ll spend $12,508 in interest — more than doubling the total cost of your debt.But that’s assuming you don’t take on additional debt. If you’re still using that card for new purchases, the debt cycle will pile up. It’s best to switch to using debit or cash for everyday purchases to avoid paying even more interest.“You really want to sit down and look at the details that might make you uncomfortable, because it’s better to know than not to know,” McClary says. “Even if your budget is balanced each month and you’re making payments on time, you really need to know how much your debt is costing you.”SMALL CHANGES CAN ADD UP TO BIG SAVINGSThere are two ways to lower the cost of your debt: increase the size of your payments and reduce the interest rate.Going back to the example of the $10,000 balance, here’s the potential impact of upping your payments. Let’s say you felt comfortable committing an extra $10 a week, or $40 a month, toward debt. By paying $240 per month instead of $200, you’ll spend $4,966 less on interest and pay down your debt nearly three and a half years sooner. Even if you’re already making more than the minimum payment, paying even more than that can make a tangible difference.Or, perhaps you can negotiate a lower interest rate with your credit card issuer. Reducing your interest rate from 20.4% to 18% (while still paying $200 a month) will lower your interest by $3,886 and shorten your repayment time frame by a year and seven months.Here are some ways to lower your interest rate:— CALL AND ASK: Call the number on the back of your credit card to inquire about your eligibility for a lower interest rate. In the worst case, the answer will be no, but you won’t be penalized in any other way just for asking.— MOVE DEBT TO A LOWER-INTEREST OPTION: If you have good or excellent credit, consider a balance transfer credit card with a 0% interest rate promotion. That can give you up to nearly two years to pay down debt interest-free. Otherwise, a personal loan could offer a lower interest rate than your credit card.LARGER PAYMENTS + LOWER INTEREST = THE ULTIMATE POWER MOVETo really cut down on the cost of debt, increase your monthly payment and seek a lower interest rate.If you paid $240 a month toward a $10,000 debt at 18% interest, you’d slash $6,697 off your total interest payments (compared to where you started) and pay down your debt nearly four years sooner.“It’s that compound interest that’s killing people at higher interest rates,” Fernandez says. “You want to be the one who understands it and earns it. You don’t want to be the one who pays it and makes credit card companies rich.”__________________________________This column was provided to The Associated Press by the personal finance website NerdWallet.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846071,Serbian right-wing opposition protests West's Kosovo plan,"BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — Supporters of Serbian right-wing opposition parties on Friday demanded that populist President Aleksandar Vucic and his government resign over a Western-backed plan for normalizing relations with neighboring Kosovo.In Belgrade, several hundred people held banners reading “No to capitulation,” or “Vucic resign,” in what they described as a “warning protest” against the 11-point plan that U.S and European Union officials say is a way out of the decades-old dispute between the former Balkan war foes.Similar gatherings were held in several other towns.Friday's protest outside the government headquarters also coincided with the start of the NATO bombing of Serbia in 1999, which ended Belgrade's brutal crackdown against separatist ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and forced Serbia to pull out of its former province.Kosovo, the majority of whose people are ethnic Albanians, in 2008 declared independence from Serbia, which has been recognized by the United States and most EU countries but not by Belgrade, Russia and China.The Western plan for Kosovo envisages that Serbia and Kosovo normalize relations without formal recognition. Serbia would no longer block Kosovo's participation in international organizations, while Kosovo would provide self-rule for its Serb minority.Washington and Brussels recently have stepped up efforts to solve the problem, fearing that Russia could try to stir trouble in the volatile Balkan region to avert attention from its war in Ukraine.Nationalists in Serbia have criticized the agreement as a de-facto recognition of Kosovo by Serbia. They have demanded that Serbia reject the deal, although EU officials said normalization of ties with Kosovo is a condition for progress toward EU membership. Both countries want to join the bloc, and have been told to mend their ties first.Around 13,000 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, were killed in the conflict in Kosovo. NATO bombed Serbia for 78 days, destroying infrastructure and army facilities, including military and police buildings in the very center of Belgrade.President Vucic, himself a former extreme nationalist who was part of the government in 1999, has described the NATO bombing an “aggression.” Anti-NATO sentiments remain high in Serbia more than two decades later.",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846072,Israeli AG warns Netanyahu broke law on conflict of interest,"JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel's attorney general on Friday warned Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he has violated the country's law on conflict of interest, which barred him from direct involvement in his government's divisive plans for a judicial overhaul while standing trial for corruption.Netanyahu’s far-right government has barreled ahead with plans to weaken the Supreme Court and grant politicians less judicial oversight in their policymaking despite massive protests from across Israeli society — including an uproar among business leaders, top legal officials and military reservists. On Thursday, just hours after his coalition passed a law that would protect the Israeli leader from being deemed unfit to rule because of his corruption trial and claims of a conflict of interest, Netanyahu defiantly pledged to proceed with the overhaul.Netanyahu contended that stripping the attorney general of the power to remove him from office was necessary to clear the way for him to participate in the negotiations on the judicial overhaul and try to “mend the rift” in the polarized nation.“Until today my hands were tied,” Netanyahu said in a prime-time TV address Thursday, referring to the change in the law on removing a prime minister.Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara thoroughly disagreed, sharply rebuking him in a letter Friday for breaking a conflict of interest agreement that had allowed him to continue leading the country while charged with corruption, bribery and breach of trust. The deal Netanyahu was pressed to sign in 2020 prevented him from being involved in legislative issues or key judicial appointments that could affect his ongoing trial.“Your statement last night and any further actions by you that violate that agreement are completely illegal and in conflict of interest,” Baharav-Miara wrote in Friday's letter. “The legal situation is clear — you must avoid any involvement in measures to change the judicial system.”The contentious law that makes it harder to remove Netanyahu from office, passed late Wednesday by a slim majority of 61 in the 120-seat parliament, does not undo the court's earlier conflict of interest ruling, Baharav-Miara said.Supporters of the judicial overhaul underway in Israel say it will restore power to elected legislators and make the courts less interventionist. Critics say the move upends Israel’s system of checks and balances and pushes it toward autocracy.Netanyahu, on an official visit to Britain, did not respond to the attorney general's letter, his office said. His far-right coalition ally, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, accused Baharav-Miara — who was appointed by a Netanyahu rival in the previous government — of having her own conflict of interest.“She continues to act as the leader of the opposition and now interferes in the prime minister's work,” he wrote on Twitter. “If Baharav-Miara wants to decide instead of elected officials, she's invited to form a party and run for parliament.”The consequences of Netanyahu’s legal violation were not immediately clear. The Movement for Quality Government in Israel, a good governance organization, pledged to file a petition urging that Netanyahu be held in contempt of court. “A prime minister who does not obey the court and its orders is an anarchist,” the group said, demanding that the “prime minister be subject to the sanctions set forth in the law, including heavy fines and imprisonment.”",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846073,AP PHOTOS: New dangers as violence surges at French protests,"PARIS (AP) — Armed with Molotov cocktails or paving stones, black-clad radicals are increasingly invading large, peaceful protest marches against pension reforms in France, attacking police in spiraling violence.Street battles between the trouble-makers — a volatile combination of anarchists, ultra-leftists and radicalized yellow vest activists — and police in several parts of the country are leaving some city centers looking like wastelands.President Emmanuel Macron inflamed public anger by sending his already unpopular plan to raise the retirement age by two years, from 62 to 64, through parliament without a vote.Violence hit a new high during Thursday's ninth union-organized nationwide marches. Clashes in Nantes, in western France, in Lyon, in the southeast, and in Paris grew increasingly brutal.Youths, their faces hidden by black scarves, broke shop windows, set fire to garbage lying uncollected in the streets due to a more than two-week strike and pelted police with stones, Molotov cocktails and fireworks. Police in riot gear charged what authorities call “radical elements,” and used tear gas and clubs to push them back in increasingly violent confrontations.Added to the anarchists and other ultra-leftists are members of the yellow vest grassroots movement, which first appeared on French streets in 2018 demanding more economic and social justice, then slowly disappeared as a destructive radical fringe ran rampant in cities.Some people pulled out umbrellas in a vain attempt to protect themselves from the tear gas. Flares sent aloft by the trouble-makers, mixed with tear gas copiously lobbed by police, turned the night sky into a thick haze.The street battles come on the sidelines of organized, peaceful marches. Authorities have likened them to urban warfare.",2023/03/24,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846105,Rwanda frees Paul Rusesabagina of 'Hotel Rwanda' fame,"KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) — Rwanda's government has commuted the 25-year sentence of Paul Rusesabagina, who inspired the film “Hotel Rwanda” for saving hundreds of countrymen from genocide but was convicted of terrorism offenses years later in a widely criticized trial.Government spokeswoman Yolande Makolo told The Associated Press on Friday that the presidential order was issued after a request for clemency on behalf of Rusesabagina, a 68-year-old U.S. resident and Belgian citizen. Senior U.S. officials said Rusesabagina arrived late Friday at the home of the Qatari ambassador in the Rwandan capital of Kigali and was expected to leave the country in the coming days.U.S. President Joe Biden hailed the news, saying, “Paul’s family is eager to welcome him back to the United States, and I share their joy at today’s good news.” He thanked the governments of Rwanda and Qatar, as well as U.S. government officials who worked “to achieve today’s happy outcome.”Nineteen others also had their sentences commuted. Under Rwandan law, commutation doesn’t “extinguish” the conviction, Makolo added.“Rwanda notes the constructive role of the U.S. government in creating conditions for dialogue on this issue, as well as the facilitation provided by the state of Qatar,” she said. President Paul Kagame earlier this month said discussions were under way on resolving the issue.Qatar foreign ministry spokesman Majid Al-Ansari said in a statement that “the procedure for (Rusesabagina's) transfer to the state of Qatar is under way and he will then head to the United States of America. This issue was discussed during meetings that brought together Qatari and Rwandan officials at the highest levels.”The senior American officials, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity under U.S. government ground rules, declined to comment on Rusesabagina's current health but said they had made medical and psychological care available.The case had been described by the U.S. and others as unfair. Rusesabagina disappeared in 2020 during a visit to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates and appeared days later in Rwanda in handcuffs. His family alleged he was kidnapped and taken to Rwanda against his will to stand trial.He was convicted on eight charges including membership in a terrorist group, murder and abduction. But the circumstances surrounding his arrest, his limited access to an independent legal team and his reported worsening health drew international concern.One senior U.S. official said the White House's goal was to shift from Washington denouncing the case — and Kigali defending its legal system in response — toward a “constructive sequence to work our way mutually, collectively, out of the predicament we found ourselves in.”As part of the effort, Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, had multiple phone calls with an unnamed close adviser to Kagame, the official said.Rusesabagina has asserted that his arrest was in response to his criticism of Kagame over alleged human rights abuses. Kagame’s government has repeatedly denied targeting dissenting voices with arrests and extrajudicial killings.In a signed letter to Kagame dated Oct. 14 and posted on the justice ministry's website, Rusesabagina wrote that “if I am granted a pardon and released, I understand fully that I will spend the remainder of my days in the United States in quiet reflection. I can assure you through this letter that I hold no personal or political ambitions otherwise. I will leave questions regarding Rwandan politics behind me.""Rusesabagina was credited with sheltering more than 1,000 ethnic Tutsis at the hotel he managed during Rwanda’s 1994 genocide in which over 800,000 Tutsis and Hutus who tried to protect them were killed. He received the U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom for his efforts.He became a public critic of Kagame and left Rwanda in 1996, first living in Belgium and then the U.S.Human Rights Watch said he had been “forcibly disappeared” and taken to Rwanda. But the court there ruled he wasn’t kidnapped when he was tricked into boarding a chartered flight. Rwanda’s government asserted that Rusesabagina had been going to Burundi to coordinate with armed groups based there and in Congo.Rusesabagina was accused of supporting the armed wing of his opposition political platform, the Rwandan Movement for Democratic Change. The armed group claimed some responsibility for attacks in 2018 and 2019 in southern Rwanda in which nine Rwandans died.Rusesabagina testified at trial that he helped to form the armed group to assist refugees but said he never supported violence — and sought to distance himself from its deadly attacks.Rusesabagina also has said he was gagged and tortured before he was jailed, but Rwandan authorities denied that. His attorney, Felix Rudakemwa, asserted that Rusesabagina’s legal papers were confiscated by prison authorities.After his sentence, Belgium’s then-foreign minister, Sophie Wilmes, said that “it must be concluded that Mr. Rusesabagina has not been given a fair and equitable trial.”Last year, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Kagame in Rwanda and discussed the case. “We still have conviction that the trial wasn’t fair,” Blinken told journalists.“It is a relief to know that Paul is rejoining his family, and the U.S. Government is grateful to the Rwandan Government for making this reunion possible,” Blinken said in a statement Friday, adding: “The United States believes in a Rwanda that is peaceful and prosperous. We reaffirm the principle of seeking political change in Rwanda and globally through peaceful means.”As the news spread on Friday, Rusesabagina's family in a statement said that “we are pleased to hear the news about Paul’s release. The family is hopeful to reunite with him soon.""___Anna reported from Nairobi, Kenya. Lujain Jo in Doha, Qatar, and Matt Lee and Nomaan Merchant in Washington contributed.",2023/03/25,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846107,Pakistani court grants protection to Imran Khan from arrest,"ISLAMABAD (AP) — A Pakistani court on Friday shielded from arrest former Prime Minister Imran Khan until at least next week, amid a roiling political crisis that has pitted the celebrity politician against the current government and spilled over into street protests.Khan was ousted through a no-confidence vote in Parliament last April. Since then, the 70-year-old former cricket player turned politician has become embroiled in more than 100 legal cases against him, including graft while in office.The ruling by the Lahore High Court was another reprieve for embattled Khan, who is now the country's top opposition leader. The court order virtually prevents his arrest until March 27 over accusations that he incited supporters from his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party to violence when he failed to appear before a court in the capital Islamabad because of hours-long clashes between his party and the police.Since November, Khan has avoided appearances before courts in Islamabad in at least three cases, including a graft charge, when he was wounded in a gun attack at a protest rally in the eastern Punjab province. Khan says his life is in danger and that's why he is seeking bail to avoid appearances before judges in multiple cases.Khan’s standoff with the government of his successor, Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif, has turned increasingly violent in recent weeks. Last week, his supporters clashed with police in Islamabad, resulting in injuries to dozens of officers.Because of the violence, Khan could not appear before the judge in person to face indictment in the graft case. He is accused of illegally selling state gifts he had received during his term as premier and concealing his assets.Khan has denied all charges against him, saying he is being victimized by Sharif's government.Friday's court order was another reprieve for Khan, who is expected to lead a rally in Lahore on Saturday to pressure the government of Sharif to agree to the holding of snap elections. Sharif has said the next parliamentary elections will be held on time later this year when the parliament completes its five-year term.Khan has repeatedly alleged that his ouster was a conspiracy engineered by his successor, Sharif, and the United States. Both have denied the charge.But the ousted premier in recent weeks has adopted a conciliatory approach toward Washington.On Friday, Pakistan's Defense Minister Khawaja Mohammad Asif at a news conference criticized Khan for trying to seek help from diplomats and politicians in the United States, saying for months Khan blamed Washington for his ouster, and now the former premier was approaching America to get help against Sharif's government.Asif also defended this week's decision by the country's elections oversight body to delay elections for a provincial assembly in the key Punjab province from April 30 to until Oct. 8.The move has drawn criticism from Khan. Wednesday's decision by the Election Commission comes months after Khan’s party dissolved the regional assemblies in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in a failed bid to force snap national elections.On Friday, President Arif Alvi wrote a letter to Sharif, urging him to hold elections for the two provincial assemblies on time.",2023/03/24,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846109,Trump lawyer in court after being forced before grand jury,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A lawyer for Donald Trump was back in court Friday after being ordered to answer questions before a grand jury investigating the possible mishandling of classified documents at the former president's Florida estate.M. Evan Corcoran entered federal court in the District of Columbia early Friday morning, one week after a federal judge ruled in favor of the Justice Department in forcing Corcoran to answer additional questions before a grand jury that has been hearing testimony for months. He did not make any comments as he arrived at the building, and left several hours later without saying anything.The interest by prosecutors in Corcoran's testimony reinforces the legal dangers confronting Trump, making clear the department's continued focus on whether the ex-president or any of his representatives obstructed government efforts to recover hundreds of classified documents taken from the White House to Mar-a-Lago at the end of his term. A search warrant affidavit released last August showed that investigators were examining potential violations of multiple crimes, including obstruction and the willful retention of national defense information.Corcoran is relevant to the investigation because he drafted a letter that was given to the department last June asserting that a ""diligent search"" for classified documents had been done in response to a subpoena and that all records responsive to that subpoena were being provided. The letter was accompanied by the return of roughly three dozen documents with classified markings.But prosecutors have said in court filings that they developed evidence showing that additional classified documents remained at the property. The FBI returned with a search warrant on Aug. 8 and removed roughly 100 additional classified documents, the filings show.Attorney-client privilege traditionally shields lawyers from being forced to share details of their conversations with prosecutors. Corcoran invoked that privilege during an earlier appearance before the grand jury when he declined to answer certain questions.But prosecutors can get around attorney-client privilege if they can convince a judge that a client was using legal representation in furtherance of a crime, a principle known under the law as the crime-fraud exception.The Justice Department made that argument in this case, and secured a sealed order last week from U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell that required Corcoran to appear again before the grand jury to answer additional questions. A federal appeals court this week, also in a sealed order, directed Corcoran to turn over documents to prosecutors.Another Trump lawyer, Timothy Parlatore, confirmed in an interview with The Associated Press on Friday that he had voluntarily testified for about six hours or seven hours before the grand jury in December to answer questions about the Trump team's compliance with Justice Department efforts to reclaim the classified documents. His appearance was earlier reported by ABC News.The Mar-a-Lago investigation is being led by a Justice Department special counsel, Jack Smith, who is also examining attempts by Trump and his allies to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. Trump faces a separate investigation by the Manhattan district attorney's office — into hush money payments during the 2016 campaign — that appears to be close to wrapping up, as well as an investigation in Atlanta into efforts to reverse Trump's election loss in Georgia._____Follow Eric Tucker on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/etuckerAP",2023/03/25,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846110,UK watchdog softens position on Microsoft Activision deal,"LONDON (AP) — British antitrust regulators scrutinizing Microsoft's blockbuster purchase of videogame maker Activision Blizzard on Friday dropped concerns that the deal would hurt the console gaming market, narrowing the scope of their investigation.The Competition and Markets Authority said it no longer thinks the $69 billion deal will result in a “substantial lessening of competition” for console games in the U.K., an update to provisional findings issued last month based on new evidence.The all-cash deal is set to be the biggest in the history of the tech industry. But it faces stiff opposition from rival Sony and is being examined by regulators in the U.S. and Europe over fears that it would give Microsoft control of popular game franchises like Call of Duty.The purchase hit a hurdle last month when the U.K. watchdog said in its initial decision that the deal would stifle competition for both cloud and console gaming.Based on the new evidence, including data that gives better insight into videogamers' purchasing behavior, the watchdog said it ""would not be commercially beneficial"" for Microsoft to make Call of Duty exclusive to its Xbox console. That's the opposite of its original analysis, which indicated that it would be profitable to block the game from competing consoles like Sony's PlayStation.“The cost to Microsoft of withholding Call of Duty from PlayStation would outweigh any gains from taking such action,” Martin Coleman, chair of the CMA's independent expert panel investigating the deal, said in a press release.The watchdog is still investigating the deal's impact on the cloud computing market and plans to issue a final report by April 26.Microsoft said it welcomed the findings and would work with the watchdog “to resolve any outstanding concerns.”",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846111,"With new coach, Spain aims to boost scoring against Norway","BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — It's been more than a decade of disappointments for Spain following the team's golden era that netted the 2010 World Cup title and two European championships. Now, with a new coach in charge, the team that once took a possession-based attack to its maximum expression with its “tiki-taka” passing style will have yet another chance to breathe new life into a system that again looked outdated at last year’s World Cup. Luis de la Fuente has made it a priority to solve the team's scoring problems since he was promoted from Spain’s Under-21 team to replace Luis Enrique in December, and he will get his first test on Saturday in Malaga when Spain hosts Norway in their first qualifying match for the 2024 European championship. Three days later, Spain will play Scotland in Glasgow. De la Fuente has overhauled the squad that only managed one win in Qatar and went out in the round-of-16 against Morocco. That defeat felt like déjà vu for Spain fans, coming four years after it exited in the same round against Russia at the 2018 World Cup. In both upsets, Spain completed more than 1,000 passes without creating hardly any scoring chances, and then lost penalty shootouts. Veteran Celta Vigo striker Iago Aspas took Spain’s last penalty in the shootout with Russia, only to have it saved. He is now back with Spain for the first time since 2019. De la Fuente, who is relatively unknown in Spain after spending years coaching the nation’s youth teams, has put together a squad focused on the immediate goal of Euro 2024 in Germany rather than starting a total rebuild with younger players. Aspas is 35 years old, and the three other strikers on the squad are all at least 30, making it hard to imagine they will still be at the top of their game come the next World Cup. But De la Fuente wants to ensure that his team has goalscorers, and not just the passing and playmaking stylists that Luis Enrique preferred at nearly every position. Aspas, Espanyol striker Joselu Mato, and Real Betis forward Borja Iglesias have 12 goals each in the Spanish league this season, making them the highest-scoring Spaniards in the competition. Alvaro Morata, the only pure striker Luis Enrique took to Qatar, has also returned. He has netted 10 goals for Atletico Madrid. Aspas, who was overlooked by Luis Enrique because he didn't fit his playing style, said that De la Fuente is seeking to forge a group that can find different ways of attacking rivals who don’t mind sitting back and defending. “For me, with Luis Enrique we had a very, very set way of playing, and from my point of view, we didn’t have a plan ‘B’ or other variants,” Aspas said on Thursday. “Now our coach has called up the three top Spanish scorers. If we can’t produce goals, it won’t be his fault. With Joselu, Borja and myself, we have players who can do different things and are not so tied to one way of playing like before.” While Aspas and Iglesias are capable of creating goals for themselves and teammates, Joselu is an old-fashioned center forward who likes to battle for long balls and scores with one touch of his boot or head. He can now make his debut for Spain at the age of 32. Other players are getting a second chance. Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga hasn’t played for Spain since 2020. Real Madrid defender Nacho Fernández, 33, returns for the first time since 2018. De la Fuente has also opted for a defense that is more physical. Athletic Bilbao’s Iñigo Martínez, 31, is back, while Osasuna’s 29-year-old center back David García made Spain's squad for the first time. Despite the changes in personnel, this Spain team will still most likely want to keep the ball for as long as possible. De la Fuente has declared himself a “defender of Spain’s playing style.” Against Norway, Spain will not have to worry about Manchester City star Erling Haaland, who is out with a groin injury. Norway will still have Arsenal midfielder Martin Odegaard and striker Alexander Sorloth, who has scored 13 times overall for Spanish club Real Sociedad this season. Group A also includes Georgia and Cyprus. The top two finishers in the group will advance.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/24,,World

(AP) — Four of five former Memphis police officers charged in the killing of Tyre Nichols, a Black man who was handcuffed, brutally beaten and ignored by first responders for crucial minutes despite being barely conscious, can no longer work as law enforcement in Tennessee.The Peace Officer Standards & Training Commission, or P.O.S.T., voted Friday to decertify Demetrius Haley, Emmitt Martin and Justin Smith. The state panel also approved the decision by Desmond Mills to surrender his certification.The former officers have 30 days to appeal.The beating of the 29-year-old Black man happened during a late-night traffic stop Jan. 7. The commission subsequently released documents showing that Haley dragged Nichols from his vehicle and never explained why he was stopped, and that he also took photos of Nichols slumped against the car after he was pummeled by officers and sent the pictures to colleagues.Nichols died at a hospital Jan. 10.Early police accounts minimized the violence of the traffic stop — accounts since disproven by witness statements and police and surveillance video — and their specialized unit was disbanded. Two Memphis Fire Department emergency medical workers and a lieutenant were also fired.The five former police officers charged with second-degree murder have all pleaded not guilty.The Memphis Police Department requested the decertification of seven of the former Memphis officers involved, including one who retired before he could be fired.None of the fired officers or their attorneys attended their hearings before the commission on Thursday or its vote on Friday.Mills’ attorney said his client had been wrongly indicted and was “focusing on his freedom.”“It’s a waste of time,” attorney Blake Ballin said of the decertification attempt. “It is meaningless to him at this stage in his life.”An attorney for Haley declined to comment on the decertification vote. Attorneys for Martin and Smith did not immediately respond to phone messages seeking comment.In a letter included in the file seeking his decertification, Smith defended his conduct, stating that Nichols was “violent and would not comply.”The fifth former officer charged, Tadarrius Bean, has not yet had his decertification hearing before the commission. Neither have two former officers who were not charged: Preston Hemphill, who was terminated after firing a stun gun at Nichols during the traffic stop; and Dewayne Smith, the supervising lieutenant who arrived on scene after the beating, who retired instead of being fired.A seventh police employee who was fired has not been publicly named.During Nichols' funeral, Vice President Kamala Harris urged lawmakers to approve the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, a broad package of reforms that includes a national registry for police officers disciplined for misconduct, a ban on no-knock warrants and other measures.___Associated Press reporter Adrian Sainz in Memphis, Tennessee, contributed to this report.___For more on the killing of Tyre Nichols: https://apnews.com/hub/tyre-nichols",2023/03/25,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846114,Kentucky governor vetoes sweeping GOP transgender measure,"FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) — Kentucky's Democratic governor issued an election-year veto Friday of a sweeping Republican bill aimed at regulating the lives of transgender youths that includes banning access to gender-affirming health care and restricting the bathrooms they can use.The bill also bans discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity in schools and allows teachers to refuse to refer to transgender students by the pronouns they use. It easily passed the GOP-dominated legislature with veto-proof margins, and lawmakers will reconvene next week for the final two days of this year's session, when they could vote to override the veto.Gov. Andy Beshear said in a written veto message that the bill allows “too much government interference in personal healthcare issues and rips away the freedom of parents to make medical decisions for their children.”In his one-page message, he warned that the bill's repercussions would include an increase in youth suicides. The governor said, “My faith teaches me that all children are children of God and Senate Bill 150 will endanger the children of Kentucky.”Beshear told reporters later Friday that transgender children and their parents were among the Kentuckians who contacted his office as he reviewed the legislation.“I heard from children that believe this bill is picking on them, and asking — in many ways — why?” the governor said. ""I told them that I was going to show them that there is at least one person in Frankfort that cares for all of our children in the commonwealth, no matter what.”Beshear's veto comes as he seeks reelection to a second term this year in Republican-trending Kentucky, and his veto could reverberate through the November election.Republicans quickly pounced on the governor's veto to try to portray him as out of touch with most Kentuckians on the issue.“Andy Beshear thinks it’s okay for children to have access to life-altering sex change surgery and drugs before they turn 18,” state Republican Party spokesperson Sean Southard said in a statement. “Today, he revealed how radical he truly is.”The legislation in Kentucky is part of a national movement, with state lawmakers approving extensive measures that restrict the rights of LGBTQ+ people this year, from bills targeting trans athletes and drag performers to measures limiting gender-affirming care.In Kentucky, the expanded version that reached Beshear's desk was rushed through both legislative chambers in a matter of hours on March 16 before lawmakers began an extended break. The fast-track work enabled lawmakers to retain their ability to override the governor's veto. The action triggered outrage and tears among opponents unable to stop the legislation.Chris Hartman, executive director of the Kentucky-based Fairness Campaign, praised the veto, saying the bill would cause ""disaster and despair for transgender Kentucky kids and their families.""The bill’s supporters say they are trying to protect children from undertaking gender-affirming treatments that they might regret as adults. Research shows such regret is rare.The repackaged measure would ban gender-affirming care for transgender minors. It would outlaw gender reassignment surgery for anyone under 18, as well as the use of puberty blockers and hormones, and inpatient and outpatient gender-affirming hospital services.Doctors would have to set a timeline to “detransition” children already taking puberty blockers or undergoing hormone therapy. They could continue offering care as they taper a youngster’s treatments, if removing them from the treatment immediately could harm the child.Transgender medical treatments have long been available in the United States and are endorsed by major medical associations.“The American Medical Association reports that receipt of care dramatically reduces the rates of suicide attempts, decreases feelings of depression and anxiety and reduces substance abuse,"" Beshear said in his veto message.The bill would not allow schools to discuss sexual orientation or gender identity with students of any age.Another key provision would require school districts to devise bathroom policies that, “at a minimum,” would not allow transgender children to use the bathroom aligned with their gender identities.It also would allow teachers to refuse to refer to transgender students by the pronouns they use and would require schools to notify parents when lessons related to human sexuality are going to be taught.Beshear said in his veto message that the bill would turn educators and administrators into “investigators that must listen in on student conversations and then knock on doors to confront and question parents and families about how students behave and/or refer to themselves or others.”David Walls, executive director of The Family Foundation, condemned the veto, saying the bill seeks to protect children and their parents from “radical, politicized ideologies.”After the bill passed the legislature, the American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky warned that it “stands ready” to challenge the measure in court if it becomes law.",2023/03/25,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846115,Poland honors citizens who helped Jews during Holocaust,"WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Polish President Andrzej Duda took part in nationwide observances Friday to honor Poles who risked — and often lost — their lives trying to save Jews from the Holocaust during the Nazi German occupation of Poland.Duda spoke at a memorial site in Markowa, a village in southeastern Poland where on March 24, 1944 Nazi forces shot and killed a farmer, his pregnant wife and their six children along with eight Jews the family was hiding at their farm.Pope Francis has declared the members of the Ulma family as martyrs. In Poland, they are a symbol of the bravery of the Poles who took the utmost risk while helping Jews during WWII.Speaking at the Markowa Museum of Poles Saving Jews During World War II, Duda noted there were many families in the region and across Poland who hid Jews, in many cases ensuring they survived.The names of the Ulmas and of other families engraved on plaques testify that there were many people who “behaved in a decent way, whose love of their brethren, Christian values and ethics were stronger than the fear of death, not only theirs, but also of their families,” Duda said.After invading Poland on Sept. 1, 1939 and taking over the country, Nazi Germans punished any form of assisting Jews, even offering them a glass of water, by killing the helpers and their families.Still, more than 7,200 Poles are listed by Yad Vashem, the World Holocaust Remembrance Center in Jerusalem, as having taken risks to save Jews. Publications by historians in recent years have also led to bitter debates about those Poles who turned in their Jewish neighbors, or participated in the killing or victimization of Jews.Disagreements over aspects of Polish behavior during the Holocaust have created tensions between Poland and Israel over the years.Unlike some other occupied countries, Poland never had a collaborationist government, and members of the resistance and of the government-in-exile in London warned Western leaders more than once about the Nazis’ mass killing of Jews.The Germans, sometimes assisted by collaborators among the civilian population, killed some 3 million of the estimated 3.3 million Jews who lived in Poland before World War II as well as almost 3 million non-Jews.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846117,NOT REAL NEWS: A look at what didn't happen this week,"A roundup of some of the most popular but completely untrue stories and visuals of the week. None of these are legit, even though they were shared widely on social media. The Associated Press checked them out. Here are the facts:___Faulty comparisons made between Trump, Clinton paymentsCLAIM: It is a double standard that former President Donald Trump may be indicted over alleged hush money payments to a woman who accused him of sexual encounters, while former President Bill Clinton faced no criminal charges for paying a sexual harassment accuser $850,000.THE FACTS: Clinton and Trump’s cases have key differences, according to experts. Clinton's payment was public and legal. The payment in Trump’s case was through a shell company and reimbursed by Trump, whose company logged the reimbursements as legal expenses in the final weeks of his 2016 presidential campaign. Social media users are spreading the inaccurate comparisons of Trump’s case and one involving Clinton as a Manhattan grand jury weighs whether to indict Trump over hush money payments made on his behalf. “Bill Clinton paid Paula Jones $850K to go away, I don’t remember the FBI raiding his lawyer’s office,” reads the text on a post being shared widely across social media. Similar claims were also posted to Twitter by a Republican congressman. “There is no comparison between these two payments from a legal point of view,” said Kathleen Clark, a law professor specializing in legal and government ethics at Washington University in St. Louis. “The 1998 Clinton-Jones settlement was a settlement of a civil lawsuit. And the settlement was public and was filed in court. In contrast, this payment from Trump to Stormy Daniels was secret.” She added that another difference is that Trump’s former lawyer, Michael Cohen, pled guilty to violating federal campaign finance laws in connection to the payment. Cohen, now a key prosecution witness, has said Trump was involved as well. Trump faces a possible indictment over his alleged involvement in the $130,000 payment made in 2016 to the porn actor Stormy Daniels to keep her from going public about a sexual encounter. Trump denies the encounter and any wrongdoing. Cohen paid Daniels through a shell company before being reimbursed by Trump, whose company, the Trump Organization, logged the reimbursements as legal expenses, the AP has reported. During Cohen's trial, federal prosecutors said the payments amounted to illegal, unreported assistance to Trump’s campaign. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s team appears to be looking at whether Trump or anyone committed crimes in New York state in arranging the payments, or in the way they accounted for them at the Trump Organization, according to AP reporting. Nan Hunter, a professor of law emerita at Georgetown University’s law school, said Bragg could potentially charge Trump with falsifying a business record because he has claimed that the money paid to Daniels was a legitimate business expense incurred by the Trump corporation. “This charge is grounded in usage of corporate funds for a purpose unrelated to legitimate corporate activities, since the underlying issue was not conduct engaged in by the business but the personal actions of Mr. Trump,” Hunter wrote in an email. “In addition, there may be a charge that the purpose of the payment was to affect the outcome of an election through a secret payment in violation of election laws.” Clinton, meanwhile, agreed to pay his accuser, Jones, $850,000 to drop a sexual harassment lawsuit. He settled out of court in November 1998, about halfway through his second term as president. As part of the settlement, he acknowledged no wrongdoing. Jones alleged that Clinton, as Arkansas governor in 1991, made a crude advance when she was a clerk for the state government. Her lawsuit was later dismissed by a federal judge. Hunter and Clark both said Clinton’s payment was legally sound. Clinton agreed to settle the case because Jones could have appealed the dismissal. Under the terms of the settlement, Jones agreed not to appeal the judgment against her, Hunter said. “There is nothing shady or illegal about two parties settling a case,” Hunter said, adding, “there was nothing secret about the payment and there were never any criminal charges.”— Associated Press writer Sophia Tulp in New York contributed this report.___Grindr didn’t threaten to expose lawmakers using appCLAIM: The gay dating app Grindr says if Florida doesn’t stop passing homophobic and transphobic laws, it will reveal every Republican legislator and party official who secretly uses the app.THE FACTS: This claim originated on a satirical account. A spokesperson for Grindr denounced anti-LGBTQ legislation while confirming the app “protects the privacy of all its users.” Facebook and Twitter users were spreading the claim as real after a Twitter account posted it on Wednesday. The Twitter account that initially posted the claim identifies its content as “halfway true content and satire.” A spokesperson for the app confirmed it was unfounded in an email to the AP. “This claim is false,” said Grindr spokesperson Patrick Lenihan. “Grindr protects the privacy of all its users. Anti-LGBTQ legislation is abominable and cruel, and we vehemently condemn any laws that restrict, deny, or abolish the rights of LGBTQ people.” Grindr has previously faced criticism and been fined for sharing personal data with third parties that could potentially identify users. The privacy policy on the company’s website outlines how it uses and aims to protect user data. It adds that its goal “is to put you in control of as much of the Personal Information that you share within the Grindr Properties as possible.” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ administration is moving to ban classroom instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in all grades, expanding the controversial law that critics call “ Don’t Say Gay.” The state’s Republican-led legislature also has proposed a range of laws related to gender and sexuality.— Associated Press writer Ali Swenson in New York contributed this report.___Spike in deaths in Australia from COVID illnesses, not vaccineCLAIM: Australia is seeing its sharpest rise in deaths in 80 years because of the coronavirus vaccine.THE FACTS: While a recent analysis found that the country saw a higher than expected number of deaths in 2022, it also concluded coronavirus vaccines weren’t the cause. Many social media users are sharing an article from a website known to run stories based on conspiracy theories that cites an analysis released earlier this month by the Actuaries Institute. That analysis found that Australia had nearly 12% more deaths than expected in 2022 — the highest year-over-year rise since World War II in the 1940s. But the report doesn’t claim that coronavirus vaccines were the cause, as some social media users suggest. In fact, the institute concludes the shot had a “negligible” effect. The report notes that the Australian government’s Therapeutic Goods Administration, which regulates vaccines, has confirmed 14 cases in which a person’s death was linked to vaccination, out of nearly 1,000 potential cases reported to the agency. Instead, the institute attributes roughly two-thirds of the 20,000 additional, or “excess,” deaths, to the coronavirus pandemic itself. The report that it had predicted there would be 172,000 deaths in the country last year, but actual deaths ended up closer to 192,000. The report found more than half were directly due to COVID-19 illness. Delays in emergency and routine care for non-COVID illnesses were also significant factors, the group said. Pressure on the nation’s healthcare system likely led to people “not getting the care they require, either as they avoid seeking help, or their care is not as timely as it might have been in pre-pandemic times,” the report stated. Spokespersons for the institute didn’t respond to emails seeking comment this week, but Australian government officials and researchers not affiliated with the group agreed with its assessment. “If vaccines were responsible — and COVID wasn’t — in Australia, we should clearly see that 2021 was the biggest year for mortality,” James Trauer, a biostatistics professor at Monash University in Melbourne, wrote in an email. “Because that year we administered the greatest number of vaccines and had relatively little COVID. Clearly that’s not the pattern in Australia.” Jason Donohoe, a spokesperson for the Australian Department of Health and Aged Care, concurred, adding that the agency’s ongoing review of the vaccine has so far found that the inoculation led to death only in “extremely rare cases.” “There’s no credible evidence to suggest that COVID-19 vaccines have contributed to excess deaths,” he wrote in an email. Daniel Demant, a public health lecturer at the University of Technology Sydney, noted that deaths were unusually low in 2020 due to lockdowns and other restrictions. But as those restrictions were eased in the latter part of 2021, deaths from COVID-19 began to rise. “These were deaths that were expected in 2020 but didn’t happen,” Demant wrote in an email. “These deaths then happened in 2021 and 2022.”— Associated Press writer Philip Marcelo in New York contributed this report.___Find AP Fact Checks here: https://apnews.com/APFactCheck___Follow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheck",2023/03/24,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846141,Germany walks fine line on nuclear weapons,"If the Cold War had gone nuclear, it would have likely begun on German soil. Geographically, Germany sat between the United States and its NATO allies on one side, and the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact countries on the other. Politically, the country was split between West and East. Strategically, that was where the US and Soviet militaries faced off — on either side of the Iron Curtain.Germany was therefore a nuclear tripwire between the enemy superpowers, and the country both benefits from the supposed safety of the US nuclear umbrella, and still faces the direct risk of nuclear escalation. Former West Germany has been home to a strong pacifist movement, while many in former East Germany hold a less hostile view of Russia.These factors help make the issue of arms control a particularly sensitive one in Germany.""Germany remains clearly committed to its engagement in arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation, even given the changed conditions,"" an official from the German Federal Foreign Office told DW.That is a reference to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which some military analysts fear could lead President Vladimir Putin to break the ""nuclear taboo,"" if his conventional forces continue to struggle on the battlefield.""The federal government, with its partners, unequivocally opposes any softening of the taboo,"" the German government official added, referring to an unwritten understanding not to use nuclear weapons ever since the US did twice against Japan, ending the Second World War in 1945.Germany's opposition to nuclear weapons competes with the expectation that it supports the security status quo. NATO nuclear sharing — the US-led military alliance's long-standing policy that permits the stationing of US nuclear weapons on non-US territory — means German warplanes could carry them in the event of nuclear war.As many as 20 such warheads remain at the Büchel Air Base in western Germany, according to an estimate by the Nuclear Threat Initiative. The think tank, based in Washington, DC, counted some 130 others at the Ramstein Air Base, until they were removed between 2001 and 2005.The nuclear balancing act adds tension both to German domestic politics as well as to the Euro-Atlantic alliance. Any disagreement, however, has taken a back seat after Russia's war in Ukraine.Some politicians in the Green Party, traditionally one of Germany's more fierce critics of nuclear weapons, have also been among the country's most vocal supporters of Ukraine. NATO officials, meanwhile, take every opportunity to show that Russia's efforts to divide the alliance have failed.""Clearly, we are at something of an inflection point,"" John Erath, Senior Policy Director for the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, told DW. ""One of the means Russia has chosen to accomplish its end is to make threats of the use of nuclear weapons.""That end — taking control of Ukraine, and breaking US and NATO support — has so far not come to pass. However, using nuclear weapons as a ""diplomatic tool,"" Erath said, has been somewhat effective at moderating that support. The US has been careful to avoid escalation that could draw it into direct conflict with Russia, and German officials have often expressed their concern about crossing a line that would make Germany an official party to the war.""The real danger lies in if this conflict concludes with Russia perceived as succeeding, and this tool being perceived as being effective. Because that opens the floodgates,"" Erath said. Other nuclear-armed states, such as North Korea, could make bolder threats with their own arsenals.Such nuclear diplomacy has precedent. In the 1980s, new deployments of Soviet nuclear forces prompted NATO to respond in kind. Widespread protests, especially in then-West Germany, pressured the government to oppose the stationing of more US missiles on its soil.By NATO's own account, it was a ""difficult period for West Germany as well as NATO."" The alliance, however, held. A ""double-track"" compromise was reached, which saw more deployments, but also negotiations to reach a deal with the Soviet Union on arms control.""Differences in nuclear risk tolerance among NATO allies can be a pressure point for Russia to exploit,"" Jonas Schneider, an international security associate at the Berlin-based security think tank SWP, told DW. ""Overall, Germany has staked out a more cautious positioning when it comes to nuclear risk.""Arms control in terms of treaties is at its nadir, now that Russia has suspended — but not withdrawn from — New START, the last major agreement limiting Russian and US nuclear systems. However, security analysts like Schneider are sanguine.""In all, I don't see an increase in the nuclear risk as a result of what's happened to New START,"" he said.That is partly because treaties are just one element of arms control. Transparency, dialogue, and data collection through both public and clandestine means are others. Nuclear weapons are expensive and conspicuous, making changes in numbers or deployment fairly easy to spot.The treaties have also only covered Russian and US forces. While they control about 90% of the world's nuclear weapons, including first-strike capability, the absence of China from these treaties is a bigger worry.There are several small and midsize nuclear-armed states, but Erath said it is China ""where things are changing in the nuclear world."" Moreover, the US lacks the awareness and lines of communication of the kind built up with Russia over decades.""If there were to be a crisis over Taiwan, it's a little bit harder to get that direct line to Beijing,"" he said.Most countries do not possess nuclear weapons, and 92 of them have signed the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. Without any of the world's nuclear powers on board, however, the agreement is largely symbolic.Germany, which supports the abolition movement but is beholden to US nuclear doctrine, finds itself trying to do two things at once. Germany attended a treaty meeting in 2022 in Vienna as an observer — a reflection of anti-nuclear aspirations competing with real-world nuclear commitments.Edited by Ben KnightWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846143,India braces itself for intense heat waves,"India has already been witnessing above-average temperatures this winter season, with its hottest February in well over a century and the India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecasting an ""enhanced probability"" of heat waves between March and May.Summer seems to come earlier every year in India, with the average daytime temperature as much as 3.4 degrees Celsius above the norm, while central India recorded its second warmest February with the average maximum temperature more than 2 degrees Celsius higher than normal.""Above normal maximum temperatures are likely over most parts of northeast India, east and central India and some parts of northwest India from March to May,"" the IMD said in a statement.Experts predict tougher times with an increased heat wave probability during the upcoming summer season. The main problem is the threat of crop damage.The maximum temperature in some wheat-growing areas such as Rajasthan soared above 39 degrees Celsius (102 degrees Fahrenheit) earlier this month, nearly 7 C (12.6 F) above normal, according to IMD data.Last year, for instance, India recorded its hottest March, which triggered an early onslaught of heat waves, engulfing several states across northern, central and eastern regions for two months. The country then reported 280 heat wave days between March 11 and May 18.Experts are highlighting La Nina as a cause for the heat, which refers to the periodic cooling of ocean surface temperatures in the central and east-central equatorial Pacific that affects global weather patterns.""The summer of 2023 is a disaster in the making that will feature an unprecedented heat wave due to a weak western disturbance and the prevailing La Nina condition,"" Abinash Mohanty, sector head of climate change and sustainability at IPE-Global, an international development organization, told DW.Mohanty pointed out that climatological and meteorological conditions coupled with unsustainable anthropocentric activities are causing harsher heat waves that will severely affect food chains.Earlier this week, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) launched its synthesis report on the climate crisis, saying that despite progress in policies and legislation around climate mitigation since the previous such report in 2014, it is ""likely that warming will exceed 1.5 C during the 21st century.""""This year has already witnessed anomalies in February, and an enhanced probability prediction by IMD suggests that the situation is going to be tougher in the coming months,"" said Mohanty.Akshay Deoras, a meteorologist at the UK's National Centre for Atmospheric Science and the Department of Meteorology, said early heat waves do not necessarily mean more frequent and intense heat waves.""While the official forecast suggests an enhanced probability of heat waves over central and northwestern parts of India during March to May, some models disagree,"" Deoras told DW.""Given models have a varying prediction skill, we cannot be sure right now about the enhanced probability of heat waves this season. It is important to remember that the frequency, intensity, and duration of potential individual heat waves in a season cannot be predicted,"" added Deoras.Scientists and meteorologists assert that changes in temperature and rainfall in India will add to the current water stress in the country. More importantly, premature rains could damage winter-sown crops — such as wheat, rapeseed and chickpeas — just before harvesting begins.According to a study by the Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar (IIT), the frequency of severe heat waves in India will increase 30-fold by 2100. Under a business-as-usual scenario, heat wave frequency might increase 75-fold.""If temperatures continue to rise and monsoon rainfall patterns continue to change, the country could see a GDP loss of 2.8%, depressing the living standards of nearly half its population by 2050,"" according to a World Bank report in 2018.Sounding a dire warning, the report said almost half of South Asia's population, including India, now lives in vulnerable areas and will suffer from declining living standards that could be attributed to falling agricultural yields, lower labor productivity or related health impacts.Based in New Delhi, the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), a public interest research and advocacy non-profit organization, said that localized climate disasters — on 241 of 273 days until October last year — had claimed at least 2,755 lives, while affecting some 1.8 million hectares of crop area, killing more than 69,000 livestock and destroying 416,667 houses.""Feeding and powering a heat-stressed India calls for impact-based heat-wave early warning, promoting ways and means to restore the fissured landscapes through nature-based solutions. This can make agri-food systems heat stress ready, followed by a fast-tracked renewable energy deployment across the heat-wave hotspots,"" stressed Mohanty from IPE-Global.Heat waves are termed the ""silent disaster"" as heat-related deaths are often undercounted around the world, according to the World Weather Attribution Network.Judging by recent years, it is increasingly clear that India is among the most vulnerable countries when it comes to climate change. Experts argue that the country's early warning system needs to become more robust.Edited by: John Silk",2023/03/24,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846144,China eyes closer ties with Brazil during Lula visit,"Chinese leader Xi Jinping is hosting Brazil's president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, in Beijing on Sunday, seeking to deepen ties with another diplomatic ally following his three-day visit to Russia that took place earlier this week.The state visits come at a time when China is trying  to present itself as an important global power that can rival the US.China's trade relationship with Brazil is set to take center stage, as Lula is bringing a delegation of 240 business representatives with him to Beijing. Trade flow between China and Brazil currently amounts to $150 billion (€140 billion) annually, and Brazilian exports to China reached $89 billion in 2022.China now invests in a wide range of sectors in Brazil, and experts say Beijing wants to tap into the South American country's rich resources and market size.""Brazil has a lot of resources that are of interest to China, and soy from Brazil is a major component of China's overall thinking on food security,"" said Margaret Myers, director of the Asia and Latin America Program at the Inter-American Dialogue (IAD).Myers added that, given the size of the Brazilian market, it was a natural choice for Chinese companies to make it one of their first destinations in Latin America.""The welcoming of China, Chinese engagement, and Chinese investment to Brazil by the Lula administration in 2010 helped grow the bilateral dynamic,"" she told DW.Other analysts point out that Lula's trip aims to further expand Chinese investment in Brazil, particularly in the manufacturing sector.Evandro de Menezes de Carvalho, a professor of international law at Brazil's FGV University, said that Brazil hopes to attract Chinese companies that can help foster growth in areas like automobiles and green energy.The agricultural sector will feature prominently during Lula's trip to China, as 90 representatives from the agricultural industry will travel to China with the Brazilian president.Among them, the meat industry is particularly eager to gain more access to the Chinese market, as the world's largest meat company, JBS SA, has sent 10 representatives as part of the Brazilian delegation, according to Reuters news agency.Leland Lazarus, the associate director for national security at Florida International University in the US, pointed out that while China views Brazil as an important pillar in its engagement with Latin America, Lula will try to strike a balance between prioritizing courting Chinese trade and investment while taking a tough stance on China when it comes to environmental issues.""Lula won't be so keen to simply play second fiddle,"" he told DW. ""He will likely continue to find ways to boost exports of frozen bovine meat, soybeans, iron ore, and crude petroleum to China's massive market. At the same time, [he is likely to demand] China do more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and [hold] Chinese state-owned enterprises operating in Brazil accountable for damaging Brazil's precious environment.""Although Brazil hopes to maintain its deep economic engagement with China, the dominance of Chinese companies across many sectors in Brazil sparks unease among Brazilian businesses and industry leaders.In a recent piece published by the US-based think tank Global Americans, Even Ellis, an expert on Latin American Studies at the US Army War College Strategic Studies Institute, pointed out that Chinese businesses have invested an estimated $70 billion in Brazil over the last two decades.Additionally, Chinese businesses have projects in 23 of Brazil's 26 states, which span across sectors like mining, agriculture, industry, telecommunications, finance, and medicine.Myers from IAD said that industries and interest groups have expressed growing concerns about China's engagement in certain sectors.According to her, the manufacturing sector in Brazil has been resisting open trade with China, as they worry it would negatively impact Brazilian industry and competitiveness. ""There are many concerns about Chinese dominance across different sectors,"" she said.While Brazil is not a signatory to China's flagship Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Myers said the topic will likely be brought up when Xi and Lula meet on Sunday.""Signing onto the BRI will result in some economic benefits for Brazil,"" she said, adding that it was critically important for China to garner support not just for the BRI, but also for other wide-ranging China-backed initiatives.While bilateral trade issues will dominate the agenda of Lula's trip, there are also important geopolitical implications when the Chinese and Brazilian leaders meet.The two countries signed a ten-year cooperation plan in 2012, after Beijing upgraded the bilateral relationship to a ""comprehensive strategic partnership.""China also sent former Vice President Wang Qishan to attend Lula's inauguration earlier this year, highlighting the importance of Beijing's relationship with Brasilia.As both countries are members of the BRICS group, some experts expect Xi and Lula to discuss the current status and future prospects of the alliance.Myers told DW that she expects the two leaders' discussion to also include the ongoing war in Ukraine. ""The Ukraine war will come up in a much more pragmatic sense, including the aspects related to BRICS and the implications of the conflict for the platform,"" she said.Lazarus from Florida International University added that Xi and Lula will likely present BRICS as ""a successful framework for Global South cooperation.""""While Xi may seek to claim economic leadership of BRICS, Lula will likely claim moral leadership on climate protection,"" he said.Additionally, Brazil's role as a major player in South America also can offer a balancing effect amid the rising tensions between China and the US, said Dawisson Lopes, a professor of international and comparative politics at the Federal University of Minas Gerais in Brazil.""It's crucial for both China and the US to maintain good relationships with the largest country in South America,"" he told DW.Edited by: Wesley Rahn",2023/03/24,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846145,Denmark probes mystery object near Nord Stream pipelines,"Danish authorities have contacted the owners of the Nord Stream pipelines after discovering a mysterious object placed directly next to it on the seabed.The pipeline, which was built to carry Russian gas to Europe, was previously targeted in a suspected attack several months after Russia's February 24, 2022, invasion of neighboring Ukraine.On Thursday, the Danish Energy Agency released a photo of a cylindrical object, saying it may simply be a maritime smoke buoy that ""does not pose an immediate safety risk.""""With a view to further clarifying the nature of the object, Danish authorities have decided to salvage the object with assistance from the Danish Defense,"" the agency said in a statement, adding that it was waiting for a response from pipeline operators before commencing its efforts.Russian President Vladimir Putin previously announced the discovery of the 40-centimeter (16-inch) tall object with a diameter of 10 centimeters (4 inches) earlier this month, saying Russian experts suspected it of being an explosive signal device.The Kremlin on Friday said it was important to establish what exactly the object is and called for a transparent investigation. ""It's certainly positive news when the owner of the pipeline is invited to take part in very important phases of the investigation,"" said Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov.Currently, German, Swedish and Danish authorities are carrying out an investigation into the  September explosions that damaged the pipelines, spewing large amounts of gas from both the Nord Stream 1 and 2 lines into the Baltic Sea.It remains unclear who may have been behind the original attack.The majority stake in the twin pipelines is held by Russian energy giant Gazprom, the remaining shares are owned by Dutch, French and German companies.js/rc (AFP, Reuters)",2023/03/24,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846146,Shaw Brothers Holdings Limited Announces 2022 Annual Results,"Effort focused more on drama series production as pandemic affected film production     To capitalize on post-pandemic economic recovery and growing popularity of video-on-demand streaming platforms through greater efforts to produce films, online movies and dramas   HONG KONG SAR -  Media OutReach - 24 March 2023 -  Shaw Brothers Holdings Limited (""Shaw Brothers"" or the ""Group""; Stock Code: 953) announces its annual results for the year ended 31 December 2022 (the ""Year"") today.   RESULTS HIGHLIGHTS         In February 2022, a 30-episode action crime drama series ""Flying Tiger 3"" was broadcast in Hong Kong, building on the success of its previous two seasons.         In December 2022, a 27-episode anti-corruption drama series ""Mission Run"" was first broadcast in mainland China.         An action crime film ""Endless Battle"" is scheduled to be first released on Youku in mainland China in May 2023 and its theatrical release in Hong Kong is expected in the same month.         The Group's revenue decreased by 25% to RMB161,051,000 in 2022 from RMB215,518,000 in 2021 mainly due to the decreased revenue contribution from both the film, drama and non-drama production segment, and artiste and event management segment amid the Covid-19 pandemic.         Loss attributable to the owners of the Company was RMB302,000 in 2022, in contrast to a profit of RMB16,403,000 in 2021.         The Group's total bank balances and cash and short-term bank deposits amounted to approximately RMB322,828,000 as at 31 December 2022 (31 December 2021: RMB312,059,000), indicating a sound financial position.         The Group's equity attributable to the owners of the Company increased by 8% to RMB452,793,000 as at 31 December 2022 (31 December 2021: RMB418,983,000).         Net asset value per share attributable to the owners of the Company increased to 31.90 RMB cents (31 December 2021: 29.51 RMB cents).         The Board did not recommend the payment of final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2022.      For the Year, the revenue of the Group was RMB161,051,000, representing a decrease of 25% from RMB215,518,000 for the year ended 31 December 2021 (the ""Previous Year""). It was mainly due to the decreased revenue contribution from both the film, drama and non-drama production segment, and artiste and event management segment during the Year. In 2022, the COVID-19 continued to mutate and spread rapidly, resulting in multiple outbreaks and lockdowns in Hong Kong and mainland China. These delayed the development of film and drama projects and reduced external commercial engagements in the artiste and event management business in 2022.   Loss attributable to the owners of the Company amounted to RMB302,000 (2021: a profit of RMB16,403,000). The loss was caused by the decrease in overall revenue and the other loss recorded in the Year due to an exchange loss arising from translation of the renminbi-denominated trade receivables, trade payables and bank deposits during the Year. Loss per share were 0.02 RMB cents for the Year (2021: earnings per share of 1.16 RMB cents).   The Board of Directors has resolved not to recommend the payment of a final dividend. The Company believes that this measure is a prudent and responsible means of preserving cash for the long-term financial health of the Group.   In 2022, the Group continued to give full play to its content development capability by producing or distributing films and drama series with high-quality content through collaboration with its business partners in the industry. During the pandemic, the Group had been focusing its effort more on the drama series production in the light of the pandemic's adverse effect on its film production business.   In February 2022, the Group had a 30-episode action crime drama series ""Flying Tiger 3"" broadcast on the over-the-top (OTT) media service platform myTV SUPER and the free-to-air channel of Television Broadcasts Limited (""TVB"") in Hong Kong, building on the success of its previous two seasons. In December 2022, the Group had a 27-episode anti-corruption drama series ""Mission Run"" first broadcast on Youku, a video hosting service platform under Alibaba Group in mainland China. ""Mission Run"" was scheduled to be broadcast on TVB's myTV SUPER and free-to-air channel in Hong Kong from February to March 2023.   The Group also released non-drama productions, including such variety shows as ""Gigi's Tasteful Kitchen Third Season"", ""The Order of Boss"", ""Drive U To The Hell 3"" and ""HAHAHAHAHA Season 2"" on various Chinese portals and online platforms in 2022.   During the Year, the Group was also preparing for the releases of new productions in 2023. An action crime film ""Endless Battle"" is scheduled to be first released on Youku in mainland China in May 2023 and its theatrical release in Hong Kong is expected in the same month. Also in the pipeline are variety shows such as ""My United Lover"", of which the shooting was scheduled for December 2022 to February 2023 in Hong Kong and ""Drive U To The Hell 7"", of which shooting was planned for March 2023 in Hong Kong.   Revenue from the film, drama and non-drama production decreased by 25% to RMB135,448,000 in 2022 from RMB180,841,000 in 2021.   The Group's artiste and event management business had been affected by the pandemic in the past several years as film and drama productions and artistes' commercial activities were shelved or postponed in compliance with the governments' anti-pandemic measures. As a result, revenue from that business segment decreased by 26% to RMB25,603,000 in 2022 from RMB34,677,000 in 2021. In 2022, 73 artistes were under the Group's management. Artistes managed by the subsidiary Shaw Brothers Pictures International Limited included famous artistes such as Bosco Wong, Joel Chan, Michael Fitzgerald Wong, Nancy Wu, Rosina Lam and Jeannie Chan; and popular singers such as Hubert Wu and James Ng. Artistes managed by the subsidiary Tailor Made Production Limited included famous artistes such as Wong Cho-lam, Roger Kwok and Eliza Sam; and popular singers such as Teresa Carpio and Vivian Lai.   In 2023, with the abatement of the pandemic and the resultant relaxation of the government's anti-pandemic measures, the Group looks forward to a recovery in the economy and in the industries of film and drama production and artiste and event management.   In terms of production, it is expected that freedom to shoot films overseas will be resumed and thus movies of more diverse subjects and genres will be able to be produced. In terms of distribution, the cinemas have seen their operation's return to normal and box-office successes of top-grossing films. The Group will make a greater effort again to produce films and will step up its effort to produce online movies and dramas for on-demand streaming services platforms in both mainland China and overseas countries, targeting Chinese communities.   The Group will also deepen the synergy between its business of film and drama production and that of artiste and event management by increasing the number of online movie and drama productions which include a combination of its own first-tier actors and actresses in the cast. It will also further tap the potential of its roster of artistes by having them conduct live-streaming e-commerce on online shopping platforms. It is expected that there will be more opportunities for its artistes to be hired in brand engagement campaigns after the pandemic.   Commenting on the Group's prospect and strategies, Mr. Li Ruigang, Chairman and Non-executive Director of Shaw Brothers, said, ""With our production expertise, established strategic partnerships and rich talent resources, we are well-positioned to capitalize on a post-pandemic recovery in the existing markets and to develop new markets under our strategy of investing in film and drama production with high-quality content. We will leverage our rich resources such as a seasoned production team and a rich pool of top artistes to tap the great potential of the markets of the Greater Bay Area and the Chinese communities all over the world as we aspire to be one of the leading content producers and curators in Asia-Pacific.""

(CSE: PHOS) (FSE: KD0) (""First Phosphate"" or the ""Company"") is pleased to announce that it has obtained additional drill results from its Bégin-Lamarche property located in the region of Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean, Quebec, Canada. These additional results are further to the Company's press release dated March 9, 2023.   Highlights:        Drill hole BL-23-03 intersected 8.4% P2O5 over 64.2 m starting in mineralization at bedrock ground level.           Layer 3 discovered originally with drill hole BL-23-02 (8.4% P2O5 over 57.3 m) was found to extend to drill hole BL-23-03 (8.4% P2O5 over 64.2 m). This establishes continuity of Layer 3 on strike and along dip.           Newly discovered layer 4 across drill hole BL-23-03 (between 143.0 m and 201.0 m) and across drill hole BL-23-04 (between 4.8 m to 45.0 m).     ""These drill results confirm the extension of the high grade phosphate layer discovered originally with hole BL-23-02 along with a new fourth layer,"" commented First Phosphate President Peter Kent. ""What is more, the company has now drilled 17 drill holes within the main 2,000 m magnetic trend and all of them carry phosphate layers ranging from a few meters to an excess of 100 m.""   ""We note the extent of the work carried out by First Phosphate that has brought forth these impressive phosphate discoveries to our region of the Fjord-du-Saguenay MRC,"" commented Gérald Savard, Mayor of Bégin and Prefect of the Fjord-du-Saguenay MRC. ""The potential to create new jobs and wealth, as well as the possibility of improving our infrastructure through the responsible mining of phosphate, is very interesting for our municipality and for our MRC.""

True width is estimated to be 60-80% of the core length.   Drill hole BL-23-03 intersected 8.4% P2O5 (phosphate) over 64.2 m and this phosphate layer is the extension of the originally discovered Layer 3 that returned 8.4% P2O5 over 57.3 m (drill hole BL-23-02). BL-23-03 is located 100 m to the east of BL-23-02 (See Figure 1). The new results from BL-23-03 establish the continuity of this phosphate layer along strike and along dip. The mineralization is found within nelsonitic peridotite containing 15-20% apatite on average. Parameters for both holes are listed in Table 2.   Another area of interest was discovered to the southeast of Layer 3. Both new drill holes reported the presence of another phosphate layer, Layer 4, to the southeast that averages 5.0% P2O5. This layer is composed of smaller beds of nelsonitic peridotite with rocks in between the beds that also carrying apatite (phosphate mineral).   Full drill results to date indicate the presence of four large phosphate layers ranging from 60 m to 83 m in thickness and at least 300 m in length. Grades vary from 5.0 % to 10.6% P2O5 (phosphate).   The Company has now drilled 17 holes into the main magnetic trend at its Bégin-Lamarche property for a total length of 2,000 m. Layers with apatite mineralization have been identified in all drill holes. Layers range from a few meters to an excess of 100 m in thickness along the length of the holes. Samples from another 7 holes have been delivered to the assay laboratory and results are expected in the coming weeks.

A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court  no later than May 8, 2023. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.   WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition.  Many of these firms do not actually handle securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases.  Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.   DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) contrary to Defendant Lehmann's representations in December 2022, the sharp increase in customer outflows Credit Suisse began experiencing in October 2022 remained ongoing; (2) accordingly, Credit Suisse had downplayed the impact of the Company's recent series of quarterly losses and risk and compliance failures on liquidity and its ability to retain client funds; (3) as a result, Credit Suisse had overstated the Company's financial position and/or prospects; and (4) as a result, the Company's public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846149,Ford's Tenn. plant could make 500K electric pickups a year,"STANTON, Tenn. (AP) — Ford said Friday that its assembly plant under construction in western Tennessee will be able to build up to 500,000 electric pickup trucks a year at full output, part of the automaker's drive to produce 2 million electric vehicles worldwide annually by late 2026.The company made the announcement as it provided updates on the so-called BlueOval City project at an event attended by Ford executives, project leaders, politicians and residents who live near the sprawling Tennessee site.The Dearborn, Michigan, automaker announced the project in September of 2021 that would build the truck plant and a battery factory on 3,600 acres (1,460-hectares) in rural Stanton, located in Haywood County northeast of Memphis. Known as the Memphis Regional Megasite, the land designated by the state for industrial development sat unused for years before Ford moved in.Ford’s assembly plant, and the battery plant run by South Korean battery maker SK On, will employ about 6,000 people with an investment of roughly $5.6 billion, Ford said.The joint venture will also construct twin battery plants in Glendale, Kentucky, with an estimated $5.8 billion investment. The projects are expected to create more than 10,800 jobs and shift the automaker’s future manufacturing footprint toward the South while putting an emphasis on green energy.Construction on the Tennessee site began last year. Ford plans to start production by 2025, and that timetable remains in place, company officials saidConstruction is about 50% complete, said Donna Langford, Ford's project manager. Media members who joined a bus tour of the site in the rain Friday saw steel skeletons of the massive, partially built structures that will house the battery plant and the truck assembly factory. Once finished, the site will also include a Tennessee Valley Authority substation to help power the plants and a Tennessee College of Applied Technology, where workforce training will take place.The automaker said its second-generation electric truck is “code named Project T3,” and Ford CEO Jim Farley touted the truck's simplified design and high-quality technology.Ford did not release images of the new truck during the event, but it did display colorful drawings made by Tennessee schoolchildren with suggestions for its design — including some trucks that would fly.In a reference to the fast and tough Star Wars ship, Farley said the new truck “is going to be like the Millennium Falcon, with a back porch attached.”Speaking with reporters, Farley acknowledged that the Tennessee truck factory would be the most environmentally friendly new plant Ford has ever built.“Not even close,” said Farley, adding later that “this is a new industrial revolution about clean, carbon neutral manufacturing.”Ford says the plant is designed to be its first carbon-neutral vehicle manufacturing campus. It will have a 30% smaller general assembly footprint than traditional plants by simplifying sub-assemblies and reducing the number of stations on the line, Farley said.“We shrunk the plant because we have less people, we have less stations,” Farley said.Ford also said it will use recovered energy from the site to provide carbon-free heat for the assembly plant and save water by reducing evaporation from the site’s cooling towers.Before landing the Ford project, Tennessee had invested more than $174 million in the unused Memphis megasite. Tennessee lawmakers have committed to spending nearly $900 million on state incentives, infrastructure upgrades and more as part of a sweeping plan with Ford. The agreement included $500 million in capital grant funds.The lease essentially grants the land to Ford through December 2051. The rent is $1 for the entire lease term.Some of the rural West Tennessee counties surrounding the plant hope it will help boost their economies.With an economy based largely on farming, Haywood County saw its population shrink by 4.9% to 17,864 people from 2010 to 2020, one of 14 counties to lose population as Tennessee grew as a whole by 8.9%, according to census data.The factory is expected to bring both small and large businesses to the area, including hotels, restaurants, health care facilities and suppliers for the plant, among others. Real estate values also could increase.Ford's leaders have pledged to help the communities near the plant. The Ford Motor Company Fund announced Friday it has awarded 17 grants of $75,000 to $100,000 each to fire departments, arts and parks conservancy groups, a community center, local governments and other organizations in six counties.The $1.2 million grant program received 200 applications, said Mary Culler, president of the Ford Motor Company Fund.“Those are the kinds of grass-roots, capital projects that these towns and municipalities are looking for,” Culler said.As it seeks to develop its workforce in Tennessee, Ford said it has begun a talent development program that will support STEM instruction in K-12 schools, bring advanced manufacturing education to schools, and expand certification, dual-enrollment and internship opportunities for students.____AP Auto Writer Tom Krisher contributed to this story from Detroit.",2023/03/25,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846150,Polish coal miners protest EU methane reduction regulations,"WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Polish coal miners angered by a European Union directive aiming to reduce methane emissions protested noisily Friday before the EU office in Warsaw saying it will deprive them of their jobs.Some 300 miners chanted “Thieves” and used smoke flares and sirens to draw attention to their protest in the downtown area of Poland's capital. Traffic was temporarily closed in the area.Protesting miners from the Solidarity 80 union said recent climate recommendations for the 27-member EU that call for a significant reduction of methane, starting in 2027, would force most of the nation's mines to close, with the loss of tens of thousands of jobs.The majority of Poland’s mines have a high presence of methane gas that gets released in the coal extraction process. That also leads to serious mining accidents as methane becomes explosive when mixed in low proportions with oxygen.Located in the southern Silesia region, the coal mines are among Poland’s major employers, offering some 77,000 jobs in the nation of 38 million.",2023/03/25,,World

While this used to happen in the 1960s and 1970s, it hasn't happened recently and doesn't conform to usual legal frameworks in the sector, say energy experts.Chad began producing oil in 2003 and Exxon has been operating in the country for several decades. It was running the Doba oil project in Chad.The move could scare away investors from West Africa at a time of growing global energy demand and a decline in foreign investments in the region, said Olufola Wusu, a partner and head of the oil and gas desk at Megathos Law Practice based in Nigeria.“Expropriation of any sort without compensation is not a step in the right direction, because it is going to erode investor confidence in that particular country and once investors are jittery, they pull back their investment, so regulators and leaders in Africa need to play by the rules,” he said.The government’s decision came after a long dispute between Exxon and Chad, which rejected the sale of the company’s operations last year.Tensions have risen in the West African nation in recent months with unprecedented protests mounting against the government of President Mahamat Idriss Deby.Deby was declared the head of state after his father’s death in April 2021.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846152,Italy partisans criticize Meloni over Nazi massacre comment,"ROME (AP) — Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni marked the anniversary Friday of one of the worst World War II-era massacres in German-occupied Italy, but the main association of partisans who fought to free Italy from fascism quickly criticized her comments.Meloni, whose Brothers of Italy party has neo-fascist roots, issued a statement to commemorate the March 24, 1944 massacre at the Ardeatine Caves on Rome’s outskirts. There, 335 people were shot to death as a reprisal for an attack by partisans that killed 33 Nazi soldiers on a street in Rome.Meloni said it was up to all Italians to remember the “barbaric” slaughter and to teach future generations what happened. She said the massacre “marked one of the deepest and most painful wounds inflicted on our community: 335 innocent Italians slaughtered simply because they were Italian.”The National Association of Italian Partisans, or ANPI, which preserves the memory of the World War II resistance movement against fascism and has warned of an emboldened far-right in Italy, criticized Meloni for “not remembering everything.”The group faulted in particular the premier's reference to the 335 people killed merely “because they were Italian.""“Sure, they were Italians, but they were chosen on the basis of a selection that affected anti-fascists, resistance fighters, political opponents and Jews,” ANPI leader Gianfranco Pagliarulo said in a statement.He added that the list of those who were slaughtered was compiled “with the complicity” of Rome’s police chief, the interior minister of deposed Italian dictator Benito Mussolini’s northern Republic of Salo and a Nazi war criminal. Pagliarulo said they were “all fascists.”Opposition lawmakers also faulted Meloni's comment. “One day will you be able to write the word ANTIFASCIST?” tweeted Nicola Fratoianni, a lawmaker from the Alliance of Left Greens.Meloni has sought to allay concerns about her party’s neo-fascist roots, insisting during Italy's election campaign last year that the Italian right had “handed fascism over to history” and had unambiguously condemned the suppression of democracy and anti-Jewish laws.Since becoming premier in October, she also has reached out repeatedly to members of Rome’s Jewish community.But one of the Brothers of Italy's leaders, Senate President Ignazio La Russa, has also proudly displayed Mussolini memorabilia in his home. La Russa joined Italy's president and other dignitaries at a commemoration Friday at the Ardeatine site, which took place while Meloni was in Brussels for a European Union summit.Asked about her comments, Meloni said she was being inclusive, or “omnicomprehensive,” in describing antifascists as Italians, the ANSA news agency said.Italy never went through a process similar to Germany’s denazification, and a neo-fascist party, the Italian Social Movement, or MSI, was part of Italy’s first postwar government in 1946. Meloni joined the MSI’s youth branch as a teen-ager in Rome and went onto lead the youth branch of MSI’s successor party, the National Alliance.The Brothers of Italy party succeeded the National Alliance and retains the tricolor flame of the original MSI as its logo.",2023/03/25,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846154,"Biden, Trudeau say 'inseparable' nations won't fail Ukraine","OTTAWA, ONTARIO (AP) — President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Friday celebrated the close, “inseparable” U.S.-Canada relationship and vowed that the two nations remain committed to defending Ukraine as it tries to repel a Russian invasion that has no end in sight.Biden and Trudeau met just days after Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping held talks for the first time since the start of the war. The Chinese and Russian leader agreed to deepen economic bonds between their two countries. But Biden argued that Western resolve remains stronger and warned Russia that the U.S., Canada and their allies would defend “every inch of NATO territory.""The president also bristled at the notion that Russia has managed to expand a partnership with Beijing that is allowing Moscow to sustain its economy and war effort despite the U.S. lining up an international coalition to economically isolate Russia with a barrage of sanctions. China, however, thus far has refrained from providing Russia weapons since the start of the war, according to the White House.“We have significantly expanded our alliances,” Biden said with Trudeau by his side during a joint news conference. “Tell me how in fact you see a circumstance where China has made a significant commitment to Russia? What commitment can they make?”At an earlier appearance with Biden before the Canadian Parliament, Trudeau said his country — which has provided Kyiv with artillery, ammunition, armor and tanks — remained committed to Ukraine's cause.""As you well know, Mr. President, Canada will continue to stand strong with Ukraine, with whatever it takes,"" Trudeau said.The whirlwind visit by Biden — his first visit to Canada as president — was meant to showcase U.S.-Canada ties, and both leaders offered full praise of each other.Biden, addressing Canada's Parliament, even said the U.S. was “lucky” to have Canada as its neighbor as both countries grapple with the rapidly changing global economy, climate change, war in Europe and more.“Today our destinies are intertwined and they are inseparable,"" Biden said. ""Not because of inevitability of geography, but because it’s a choice, the choice we made again and again.”“Two people, two countries, in my view sharing one heart.”On one often-difficult subject, immigration, Biden and Trudeau used the visit to announce an agreement aiming to stem the flow of asylum seekers at unofficial border crossings from the U.S. to Canada.The accord eliminates a loophole under existing rules and will allow both countries to turn away asylum seekers at their borders. At the same time, Canada announced that 15,000 migrants from the Western Hemisphere will be given official slots to apply to enter the country.The leaders also sat down with top aides for a private conversation. Besides Ukraine and defense spending, the wide-ranging talks touched on shared concerns about China's aggressiveness and violence and political instability in Haiti.Trudeau noted Beijing’s growing economic power and a need for the U.S. and Canada to work together to address it. To that end, Canada said Friday it was entering an arrangement with IBM to expand domestic research and development and advanced packaging of semiconductors — and planning an investment of up to $250 million to ""improve North American competitiveness and supply chain resiliency, help cut pollution, foster economic and national security.”Trudeau also spoke of a need to coordinate even more closely to combat climate change and grow both countries' economies.“We have to stick together,” Trudeau said. “We have to continue to face down authoritarian threats, both at home and abroad. We have to continue to defend what is right. This is not the time to compromise on our values.”At their joint news conference later, Biden briefly veered away the day's themes to send a warning to Tehran, after a suspected Iranian-made drone on Thursday killed a U.S. contractor and wounded six other Americans in northeast Syria.U.S. forces responded to the attack with airstrikes on sites in Syria used by groups affiliated with Iran’s Revolutionary Guard. Activists said the U.S. bombing killed at least four people.“The United States does not, does not seek conflict with Iran,” Biden said. But he said Iran and its proxies should be prepared for the U.S. “to act forcefully to protect our people.”The subject of difficult relations with China was an undercurrent of Biden's visit.Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, arrested in China in 2018, were in the balcony for the speeches in Parliament.The two were taken into custody shortly after Canada arrested Meng Wanzhou, technology company Huawei’s chief financial officer and the daughter of the company’s founder, on a U.S. extradition request. The Canadians were held for more than than two years in China before the Biden and Trudeau governments managed to win their release. Kovrig is a former diplomat, Spavor a businessman.Regarding Haiti, Canada is being nudged by the U.S. and other allies to lead an international mission there to deal with the ongoing humanitarian and security crisis. Canada on Friday announced $100 million ($72.7 million U.S.) in new aid for support and equipment for the Haitian National Police.Biden said the idea of deploying an international force was “not in play at the moment” but had not been taken off the table. Trudeau said the international community can have the most impact in the long term by being ""there to support the capacity of the police in Haiti.”Haitian Prime Minister Ariel Henry and the country’s Council of Ministers sent an urgent appeal last October calling for “the immediate deployment of a specialized armed force, in sufficient quantity” to stop the crisis caused partly by the “criminal actions of armed gangs.” But more than five months later, no countries have stepped forward. Canada’s top military official has suggested the country doesn’t have the capacity.Biden endorsed Trudeau's efforts to focus on capacity building but also noted the situation in Haiti remains fragile as “gangs have essentially taken the place of the government.”“It’s a work in progress,” he said.Friday's meetings also included discussion of defense spending, an issue that's in the spotlight after the U.S. shot down a Chinese spy balloon that traversed part of Canada and the continental U.S. last month.Canada has long faced calls to increase its defense spending to 2% of its gross domestic product, the agreed-upon target by NATO members. Ottawa spends about 1.2% now.""Canada and the United States share a responsibility and a commitment to make sure NATO can deter any threat and defend against any aggression from anyone,"" Biden said. “That’s the bedrock of the security of both our nations.”The Trudeau government also announced plans for a $7.3 billion ($5.3 billion U.S.) project to upgrade and build infrastructure to support the arrival of a new fleet of F-35 fighter jets.Trudeau and his wife, Sophie Grégoire Trudeau, closed the visit Friday night with a gala dinner in honor of Biden and first lady Jill Biden.",2023/03/25,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846166,"Watchdog: Israel promotes bids for 1,000 settlement homes","JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's far-right government authorized construction bids for over a thousand new homes in Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank and east Jerusalem, a watchdog group reported Friday, despite an Israeli pledge to halt settlement construction as part of efforts to curb a deadly wave of violence in the territory.The Israel Land Authority published the tenders earlier this week for the construction of 940 homes in the West Bank settlements of Efrat and Beitar Ilit, as well as 89 homes in the Gilo settlement, which lies over the 1967 line on the southern edge of the contested capital of Jerusalem. The large settlement of Efrat sits deep in the West Bank, near the Palestinian city of Bethlehem.Palestinians seek these lands, captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war, for a future independent state alongside Israel — a longstanding international goal. The Palestinian Foreign Ministry assailed the move as a betrayal of Netanyahu's vow to freeze settlement construction, showing “official disregard for American and international reactions.”The anti-settlement Israeli group Peace Now publicized the construction bids on Friday.“This is yet another harmful and unnecessary construction initiative,” the group said, accusing the Israeli government of “trampling on the possibility of a future political agreement, and on our relations with the U.S. and friendly countries.”There was no immediate comment from Netanyahu's office.The new affront to the Palestinians came just a week after Israeli and Palestinian officials met in Egypt’s southern resort city of Sharm el-Sheikh in an effort to calm rising tensions ahead of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. After the meeting, Israel repeated a pledge made at a similar February summit in Aqaba, Jordan to temporarily freeze the approval of new settlement units in the West Bank.The Palestinian Foreign Ministry criticized the tender approvals as “a blatant departure and deliberate sabotage of the understandings that were reached between the Palestinian and Israeli sides under American auspices.”Last month, the Israeli government granted approval for over 7,000 new homes in Jewish settlements in the West Bank, including in four unauthorized outposts — despite a U.N. Security Council statement sharply criticizing Israeli settlement expansion and rising opposition from Israel’s allies, including the United States.An Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief journalists, described the publication of tenders this week as procedural, saying, “All of the agreements settled during the recent joint summits in Jordan and Egypt are being respected fully.”Israel's government, the most right-wing and religiously conservative in its history, has said it aims to entrench Israeli military rule in the West Bank, boost settlement construction and erase the differences for Israelis between life in the settlements and within the country's internationally recognized borders. Netanyahu's coalition includes ultranationalist settler leaders who live in the West Bank.The international community, along with the Palestinians, considers settlement construction illegal or illegitimate. Over 700,000 Israelis now live in the occupied West Bank and east Jerusalem.The settlement construction bids come against a background of heightened tensions with the Palestinians and a national crisis in Israel over a government plan to overhaul the judicial system, which critics fear will move Israel toward autocracy.Since the start of 2023, at least 86 Palestinians, both militants and civilians, have been killed in Israeli raids throughout the West Bank — making it the most deadly start to the year in over two decades. At least 13 civilians and one police officer were killed during the same period in Palestinian attacks against Israelis.",2023/03/25,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846167,Art duo Gilbert and George get their own gallery in London,"LONDON (AP) — Artists, if they have really made a mark, might get a gallery dedicated to their work once they are gone.Gilbert and George don’t want to wait that long.The dapper duo, who have been creating beguiling and unsettling art together for over half a century, have poured their own time and money into the Gilbert and George Center, a permanent exhibition and research space devoted to their work. Located just off bustling Brick Lane in London’s East End, the building opens to the public April 1 with an exhibition of the big, bold photo assemblies for which the pair has become famous.Admission is free — and that, they say, is important.“We want to make art for people, not for collectors,” said Italy-born Gilbert Prousch, who met Englishman George Passmore at London’s St. Martin’s art college in 1967. They have been partners in art and in life ever since.“Our earliest slogan was ‘Art for all,’” added George in an interview Friday with The Associated Press.“We’re always being stopped on the streets of London by young people who say, ‘I love your art.’ We say, ‘Which art did you see?’ And they’d never actually seen an exhibition. They saw a catalogue in a house or a magazine. So we thought, if there is a proper place where you can have pictures permanently on show, it would be fantastic.”Gilbert and George — like Raphael or Madonna, known universally by their first names — are as recognizable as their art, inseparable from it and from each other.In early work they performed as living statues, a pair of impeccable gentlemen in tweed suits with a subversive streak. Later they inserted their own images into photo montages, juxtaposed against the totems and detritus of modern life – newspaper headlines, graffiti, advertisements, garbage, even excrement and bodily fluids.Over the decades they have created hundreds of these huge, multicolored assemblies, which resemble secular — some might say sacrilegious — stained-glass windows.“We invented a language for ourselves,” Gilbert said.Added George: “We have different things to say as we traverse through life, but the form remains the same.”They began as self-styled outsiders, and Gilbert says they still feel that way.“We felt we were alone,” he said. “We have never been part of an art group, never been art groupies. We kept ourselves outside. And it’s freedom to be there.”Still, the gleaming new gallery reflects their status as art world stars whose work has been displayed in museums around the world and has sold for more than $3 million at auction.The art center, with 3,000 square feet (280 square meters) of exhibition space in three high-ceilinged galleries, has been created from a 200-year-old former brewery in Spitalfields, an area that has been home to successive groups of migrants, from French Protestant Huguenots to eastern European Jews to Bangladeshi Muslims.For decades the neighborhood has attracted the young and creative, with its warehouse spaces, cheap restaurants, street markets and independent stores. Gilbert and George have lived in the area for years and have seen it move steadily upmarket; 18th-century houses like the one they live in now sell for millions.Despite gentrification, the area continues to inspire them.“The East End of London is a global center — has always been,” Gilbert said.Works in the gallery’s debut exhibition, “The Paradisical Papers,” depict the pair amid lush, faintly psychedelic foliage including flowers, berries and leaves, in bold hues of green, purple and pink. This is a very earthly paradise, with dollops of sex — there are some suggestively bulbous dates and figs — and hints of rot and decay.It may be the garden of paradise, but there is something lurking in the undergrowth.“Most people think of paradise as the afterparty, and we are reversing that: We’re starting off with the paradisical pictures,” George said.“The party’s here,” Gilbert added.Gilbert and George think of the new gallery as a gift to the public, but not a goodbye. As they enter their ninth decades — Gilbert is 79 and George 81 — the pair remain as excited by art as they were when they started.“We are still amazed and fascinated by the great mystery of creativity,” George said. “When we go down to the studio in the morning and see the picture we created or finished the day before, we are never able to reconstruct exactly how we arrived at that. And not being able to do that shows that there is some mystery and magic there.""“The pictures make themselves, as much as we can let them. We try not to interfere too much,” he added. “Think of the sound of the world turning, the pain of the world turning at the moment. Just imagine that. That’s quite an inspiration.”",2023/03/25,,World

It’s true roots music.The album was inspired by a European fable involving a hunting accident, pivotal bathing scenes and a marriage that goes sour (spoiler alert: The wife turns into a dragon). It’s confusing but fascinating, like a dream about a dream.Somehow, despite the unwieldy scope of the 45-minute set, Salvant never hits a false note. Whether the words are in French, English, Occitan or Haitian Creole, she sings them beautifully, navigating tricky melodies with the ease of Ella Fitzgerald and a playfulness that enhances Salvant’s astute sense of theatricality. She’s equally convincing singing about the fickle heart, sin and repentance or, say, becoming a dragon.Piano-led accompaniment is stellar, but sometimes so spare the tap of a cymbal shifts the mood. “Est-ce ainsi que les hommes vivent?” evokes a late-night lament in a Left Bank café, and “D’un feu secret” is delicate baroque with synthesizers. The cabaret dance tune “Doudou” rides a Latin groove, while the swinging “Fenestra” has antecedents in Africa and Brazil.The lyrics are compelling, whatever the language. Time is an assassin, Salvant sings. To cease loving is to cease living.And on “La route enchantée” she tells us in flirty French: “River, my friend, I’m singing to you.” Lucky river.___More music reviews at https://apnews.com/hub/music-review",2023/03/25,,World

But once on Canadian soil, they have been allowed to stay and pursue asylum cases that can take years to resolve.The new policy says that asylum seekers without U.S. or Canadian citizenship who are caught within 14 days of crossing anywhere along the 3,145-mile (5,061-kilometer) border will be sent back. That includes people walking on Roxham Road.The deal was set to take effect at 12:01 a.m. Saturday — a quick implementation aimed at avoiding a surge of refugee claimants trying to cross, according to Canadian officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the deal in advance.Some of the last migrants to make it through before the Biden-Trudeau announcement were about eight people in two families — one from Haiti, the other from Afghanistan — who arrived at the U.S. end of Roxham Road just after dawn on Friday. Both said they took circuitous routes to get there.Gerson Solay, 28, carried his daughter Bianca up to the border. He said he didn’t have the proper documents to remain in the United States. “That is why Canada is my last destination,” he said before he was taken into custody for processing.It’s unclear how Roxham Road became a favorite route, but it’s just a taxi ride from where Interstate 87 approaches the Canadian border, and for southbound migrants, it’s a relatively short distance to New York City.These migrants have taken advantage of a quirk in a 2002 agreement between the U.S. and Canada that says asylum seekers must apply in the first country they arrive in. Migrants who go to an official Canadian crossing are returned to the U.S. and told to apply there. But those who reach Canadian soil somewhere other than a port of entry — like the center near Roxham Road — are allowed to stay and request protection.The agreement was immediately criticized by some who feel it could endanger the safety of asylum seekers by preventing them from getting needed support from both governments.“We urge President Biden to strongly reconsider this deal and to work with Congress to restore access to asylum and support policies that recognize the dignity of all those arriving at our borders,” said Danilo Zak, associate director for policy and advocacy for the humanitarian group CWS, also known as Church World Services. The organization advocates for people across the world who have been forced from their homes.The agreement comes as the U.S. Border Patrol responds to a steep increase in illegal southbound crossings along the wide-open Canadian border. Nearly all happen in northern New York and Vermont along the stretch of border nearest Canada’s two largest cities, Toronto and Montreal.While the numbers are still tiny compared to the U.S.-Mexico border, it's happening so frequently now that the Border Patrol increased its staffing in the region and has begun releasing some migrants into Vermont with a future date to appear before immigration authorities.As part of the deal, Canada also agreed to allow 15,000 migrants from the Western Hemisphere to seek asylum on a humanitarian basis over the course of the year.Meanwhile, southbound migrants are straining U.S. border officials.U.S. Border Patrol agents stopped migrants entering illegally from Canada 628 times in February, more than five times the same period a year earlier. Those numbers pale compared to migrants entering from Mexico – where they were stopped more than 220,000 times in December alone — but it is still a massive change in percentage terms.In the Border Patrol’s Swanton Sector, which stretches across New Hampshire, Vermont and a portion of upstate New York, agents stopped migrants 418 times in February, up more than 10 times from a year earlier. About half entering from Canada have been Mexicans, who can fly visa-free to Canada from Mexico.About an hour south of the border, the police chief in St. Johnsbury, Vermont, population 6,000, alerted state officials that the Border Patrol had dropped off a vanload of immigrants with just a few minutes notice at the community’s welcome center. The same thing happened several times before within the last few weeks.In a statement, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said the migrants dropped off in St. Johnsbury had been apprehended along the border after entering the U.S. without authorization, and were given a notice to appear for later immigration proceedings.They were dropped off in St. Johnsbury because it has a station where migrants can take a bus to a larger city.“In such circumstances, USBP works in tandem with local communities to ensure the safety of all parties—both community members and migrants—and to ensure stability in the community’s resources,” the statement said.But local officials said they weren't given time to prepare. State officials are now working to set up a system to provide migrants services they might require.On Thursday, a Haitian couple and their children, boys aged 17 and 9 and a 15-year-old girl, were dropped off at the welcome center. The family, who did not want to give their names, wanted to take a bus to Miami.They said they'd been in Canada for two months, but wouldn't talk about what prompted them to keep moving.They missed the Thursday bus that would allow them to connect to a bus to Boston, where they could catch another bus to Miami. A team of local volunteers spent the day getting them something to eat, finding them a place to stay the night and arranging for them to take the bus on Friday.Police chief Tim Page said St. Johnsbury wants to help these migrants, but not on the fly.“We need to get something down so we know what we are going to do when these families arrive,” he said. “We don't have a system set yet, so when we do I am sure this will all go a little smoother.”___Associated Press contributors include Rob Gillies in Ottawa, Ontario, and AP photographer Hasan Jamali from Roxham Road.",2023/03/25,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846177,Bayern Munich and Thomas Tuchel: Second time lucky,"Sometimes in football, things move extremely quickly.On Monday, Kicker magazine published an in-depth interview with Herbert Hainer in which the Bayern Munich president spoke in glowing terms of head coach Julian Nagelsmann.""[He] proved against Paris Saint-Germain [in the Champions League] that he is tactically and strategically outstanding at the highest level,"" said the 68-year-old former Adidas CEO. ""We're planning long-term with him, as we've shown by giving him a five-year contract, and we can see clear progress. The discussions surrounding him come from outside, not from us.""By Thursday evening, Nagelsmann had been dismissed. But the identity of his replacement showed that, at other times in football, things can actually take a lot longer.Bayern Munich first approached Thomas Tuchel in 2018 when they were looking for a permanent successor to Carlo Ancelotti. Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, then Bayern chief executive, reached a verbal agreement with Tuchel, who was without a job after leaving Borussia Dortmund the previous year.But Uli Hoeness, then club president, was determined to convince 2013 Treble-winning coach Jupp Heynckes to stay on for another year, after taking interim charge and leading Bayern to the Bundesliga title. In the weeks it took for Hoeness to accept that Heynckes' nein meant nein, Tuchel joined PSG instead, and Bayern settled for Niko Kovac.Five years later, and with Tuchel reportedly already in talks with Tottenham Hotspur about potentially replacing Antonio Conte, Bayern acted quicker and have their man. But will it work?Kicker's front-page headline advertising the big interview with Hainer consisted of three words: ""Sport. Money. Family."" But one thing matters to Bayern Munich above all else: results.And Nagelsmann, despite a 3-0 aggregate win over PSG to set up a Champions League quarterfinal with Manchester City, was simply not delivering them.Sunday's 2-1 reverse in Leverkusen, Bayern's third Bundesliga defeat of the season and second of 2023, saw them surrender top spot to Borussia Dortmund ahead of the meeting between the two in Munich on April 1.After picking up just 18 points from nine games since the turn of the year, Bayern are closer to losing their Bundesliga crown than at any other point since 2012, the last time they were not top after matchday 25. Should Dortmund win in Munich, Bayern will find themselves four points behind with eight games to play – the sort of deficit they have never recovered since the introduction of three points for a win.It's now down to Tuchel to prevent that from happening. At least on paper, his appointment appears logical: a Champions League triumph with Chelsea in 2021 and the highest points-per-game average (2.12) of any Borussia Dortmund head coach in Bundesliga history speak to his pedigree.Tuchel, now 49, is meticulous and demanding, a tactical perfectionist. But he can also come across cold, robotic and impatient, and has been criticized for his man-management skills in the past.In November 2016, he publicly labelled his Borussia Dortmund players ""technically, tactically and mentally deficient"" following a 2-1 defeat to Eintracht Frankfurt, a game in which he made a triple substitution just before the hour mark.During his time at the Westfalenstadion, Tuchel also crossed swords with Sven Mislintat over the then head scout's appearance and attitude, and his alleged habit of smoking around the training ground.""Tuchel is an exceptionally good coach, that's clear,"" said Dortmund chief executive Hans-Joachim Watzke at the time. ""In principle, he was a top solution to succeed [Jürgen] Klopp because he had incredible abilities on the pitch. But sometimes things don't work in harmony.""A Dortmund source later told the Süddeutsche Zeitung broadsheet: ""We were warned by Mainz that it would likely become difficult, but we didn't listen. For a year-and-a-half everything was great. Then everything was just as Mainz said it would be.""In Tuchel's defense, his coaching career has also been characterized by unprecedented events and difficult personnel structures.Indeed, his time in Dortmund is remembered less for the 2017 cup win and more for the potentially lethal attack on the team bus ahead of a Champions League game against Monaco a month earlier. The attacker, Sergei W., was later sentenced to 14 years in jail, but the decision to postpone the game by just 22 hours marked the beginning of the end of the relationship between Tuchel and Watzke.In Paris, Tuchel won two obligatory Ligue 1 titles and a couple of cups, but also took PSG's galacticos the closest they've ever come to Champions League glory, losing to Bayern in the 2020 final in Lisbon. But he lamented that he never got the appreciation he deserved at the chaotic Qatari-run club, and clashed with sporting director Leonardo.Last September, he was sacked by Chelsea after just 100 games, despite taking the Blues from ninth to fourth in the Premier League the previous season and winning the Champions League.It was during his time at Stamford Bridge that Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich was forced to sell the club as a result of sanctions imposed on him by the British government due to his proximity to Vladimir Putin. Under new owner Todd Boehly, clear differences over recruitment policy emerged, and Tuchel was dismissed.Now back in Germany, the question is less whether Tuchel is able to deliver results, but more whether he can establish effective working relationships in with a star-studded Bayern squad and a uniquely demanding hierarchy which has now sacked five head coaches since Pep Guardiola in 2016.""The moniker of FC Hollywood was supposed to be consigned to the past,"" wrote Berlin daily Tagesspiegel. ""Yet the whole process doesn't cast [sporting director] Hasan Salihamidzic or chief executive Oliver Kahn in a good light. FC Hollywood is back!""Whether Thomas Tuchel proves to be the calming, professional influence required to continue Bayern's domestic hegemony, or merely fuel on the fire, will become clear soon enough.Edited by Michael Da Silva",2023/03/24,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846179,Deutsche Bank stocks slump as sector fears grow,"Banking shares plummeted in Europe and Asia on Friday as turmoil in the sector and the latest interest rate hikes raised concern about a potential recession.German giant Deutsche Bank seemed to bear the brunt of the hit, with its shares plunging more than 13% after a significant hike in the cost of insuring its bonds against the risk of default.In a third day of losses, Deutsche Bank shares shed a fifth of their value for the month, according to S&P Market Intelligence, a data and analytics firm.Indices in key European financial capitals slumped by more than 2% Friday, with drops reported in Asia earlier in the day.The past few weeks have seen central banks raise interest rates in an attempt to calm markets in the aftermath of the crash of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) in the US. They have been employing the mechanism for nearly a year now as a way to combat rising inflation.Recently, the European Central Bank (ECB) raised interest rates by 0.5%, while the US Federal Reserve revised its rate hike to 0.25% after fears for the banking sector prompted calls for the Fed to tone down its aggressive interest rate policy.The Fed has signaled that it may consider halting interest hikes altogether. The ECB, however, said it was nowhere near the end of its rate hike scheme, stressing that the fight against inflation is still ongoing.The most recent banking crisis started when two mid-sized US banks — SVB and Signature Bank — collapsed some two weeks ago, sounding the alarm among investors regarding the sector's overall resilience. The crisis soon spread to Europe, with Switzerland's Credit Suisse bank falling into an emergency acquisition by its main competitor UBS.Many fear a scenario similar to that which preceded the 2008 financial crisis. Banking and economic officials in the US and Europe have stressed that the banking sector is now more robust than it was 15 years ago.The crisis prompted a rush for the US dollar, a currency that many fall back on when times are tough, pumping it up 0.6% against major peers. The euro, meanwhile, fell 0.9%.Another safe-haven currency, the Japanese yen, also climbed to a six-week high, up 0.6%.Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, fell 2.5% to around $73 (€67) per barrel.rmt/js (AFP, AP, Reuters)",2023/03/24,,

Followers knew him by his profile name, “Al-Mukohl."" He was reported dead by authorities late last week. His family have not commented on the incident.In a series of videos, Abdul Razaq openly criticized Houthi rule, branding its administration as corrupt and repressive.Houthi forces, who control Sanaa and most of northern Yemen, have cracked down on dissent in their territories. Some who oppose them have been charged for working with Saudi Arabia, which heads the coalition battling the Houthis.Yemen’s devastating conflict began in 2014, when the Houthis seized the capital of Sanaa and much of northern Yemen and forced the government into exile. The Saudi-led coalition, which included the United Arab Emirates, intervened in 2015 to try to restore the internationally recognized government to power. Since then, it has devolved into a war of proxies, with Iran backing the Houthis and Saudi Arabia and the UAE backing pro-government forces.In a statement following Thursday's protest, the Houthi authorities claimed Abdul Razaq had been detained for insulting another influential family in the area. On Sunday, he escaped through a bathroom window of the police station and was found in a half-constructed building later that day, it said.In a statement Thursday, the head of Yemen’s internationally recognized government, Rashed Al-Alimi, offered his support to the protesters. The Saudi-backed leader said a monthly stipend would be given to Abdul Razaq’s family.Mohammed Ali, a high-ranking Houthi official, later said on Twitter that a committee had been set up to further investigate the incident.His death comes amid a string of similar reported incidents. Earlier this year, a fruit and vegetable vendor from northern Houthi-held territories was abducted and killed, whipping up widespread anger across the divided country.On Tuesday four activists were handed prison terms, ranging from six months to three years, by a Houthi court for their criticism of the Iran-backed rebels on social media, a lawyer said.",2023/03/25,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846191,"Darcelle, world's oldest working drag queen, dies at 92","PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — Walter Cole, better known as the iconic drag queen who performed for decades as Darcelle XV and a fearless advocate for Portland's LGBTQ+ community, has died of natural causes in Portland, Oregon. He was 92.Darcelle, who died Thursday, was crowned the world’s oldest working drag performer in 2016 by the Guinness Book of World Records and was regaling audiences until the very end. As a performer, Darcelle was known for hosting the longest-running drag show on the U.S. West Coast. Off stage, Cole, an Army veteran, championed LGBTQ+ rights and charitable work in Portland.The nightclub that Darcelle opened more than 50 years ago in downtown Portland, Darcelle XV Showplace, posted a statement on Facebook expressing grief and asking for privacy and patience.The club, which had become a Portland cultural institution by the 1970s, was listed in 2020 on the National Register of Historic Places, making it the first site in Oregon to be nominated specifically for its significance in LGBTQ+ history. In the venue's early days in the 1970s and 1980s, it was seen as taboo and protesters picketed outside, The Oregonian/OregonLive reported.It provided a lifeline for many in the city's LGBTQ community, including Cole, he told the newspaper in a 2010 interview. Cole preferred female pronouns when performing, but told The Oregonian he preferred male pronouns off-stage.“If I hadn’t admitted who I was, I’d probably be dead now,” he told the paper. “I’d be sitting on a couch retiring from ... management. Not for me.”“She touched the lives of so many, not only through her performances but also through her fearless community advocacy and charitable works,” said Todd Addams, the interim executive director of Basic Rights Oregon, speaking of Darcelle. “She was nothing short of an icon.""Writer Susan Stanley described the club a place of “warmth and affection” where performers were “glittering in sequins and satin and a shimmering froth of feathers,” in what’s credited as the first profile of Darcelle XV, published in Willamette Week in 1975.When speaking of Darcelle, Cole, a gay man, referred to his persona in the third person using female pronouns. “I’m an entertainer with a capital E,” Cole told Stanley. “Darcelle is a character — like in a play — and I work very hard at her.”Stanley wound up briefly working at the club and becoming Cole's close friend. She described the performer not only as a talented artist, who also sewed many of the club’s costumes, but as a caring person deeply invested in the LGBTQ+ community and the fight against the social stigma of the time.“(Darcelle) was just a very, very nurturing person. She encouraged other guys to perform and get out of their shells,” Stanley told the AP in a phone interview.After decades of advocacy by LGBTQ+ activists organizing for civil rights and freedoms, Stanley said she was saddened to see how drag has become so polarized in today’s political climate.“It bespeaks a really, really big misunderstanding,” she said. “Politicians wanting to step back decades in attitudes … it’s mystifying and horrifying to me at the same time.”Cole was born in 1930 and raised in Portland's Linnton neighborhood. He served in the U.S. Armed Forces and was discharged in the late 1950s, according to the club's website, which says he used money he received from the military to start his first business.After dabbling in a coffee store and a jazz club, Cole purchased the space that would become the Darcelle XV Showcase in 1967.Two years later, he had developed the “alter ego” named Darcelle and came out as gay, according to a profile on the club's website.He left his wife and began a relationship with his artistic director. During the 1970s, the Showplace became a popular destination for cabaret and drag performance.In 1999, Darcelle became the oldest drag performer on the West Coast, after the closing of San Francisco’s drag venue Finocchio’s Club.On Friday, fans including Portland's mayor mourned Cole's death on social media. Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden said in a social media post that “Darcelle carved out an unforgettable chapter in Portland’s history” with ""pioneering courage.”Darcelle XV Showplace said that details of a public memorial will be announced and all shows will go on as scheduled, per Darcelle’s wishes.“Please join us and celebrate her legacy and memory, thank you in advance for your continued support,” the club's statement said.___Claire Rush is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846192,NY's power to regulate religious schools trimmed by judge,"ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — Parents cannot be required to pull their children from private schools in New York that fail to meet state-designated standards, a judge decided, striking down a key provision of rules recently passed to strengthen oversight of such schools, including those specializing in religious education.The ruling in a state trial court in Albany came in response to a lawsuit brought by ultra-Orthodox Jewish schools, called yeshivas, and related advocacy groups over education rules enacted last fall. Under the rules, the state’s 1,800 private and religious schools must provide an education that is “substantially equivalent” to that of a public school.Opponents in the ultra-Orthodox community say the rules improperly target yeshivas, some of which focus intently on religious instruction with far less teaching in secular subjects such as English, math and science.Judge Christina Ryba on Thursday rejected an argument that the state regulations were unconstitutional. But she said state officials overstepped their authority in setting penalties for schools that don't adhere to them.Specifically, she said education officials lack legal authority to make parents take their children out of schools that fall short of the requirements, and they don't have the authority to order that those schools be closed.Ryba said parents of those children could still receive required instruction in combination with sources, such as home schooling.A co-plaintiff cheered the judge's rejection of the “draconian penalties.”“In striking those provisions of the regulations, the Court agreed with parents and non-public schools across New York State who opposed these regulations,” read a prepared statement from the group Parents for Educational and Religious Liberty in Schools.The state Education Department said the decision validates its commitment to improving the educational experience for all students.""We remain committed to ensuring students who attend school in settings consistent with their religious and cultural beliefs and values receive the education to which they are legally entitled,” read the prepared statement.It was not clear if any aspects of the ruling would be appealed.",2023/03/25,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846193,U.S. bishops' new guidelines aim to limit trans health care,"United States Catholic bishops have issued guidelines that seek to stop Catholic hospitals from providing gender transition care, a move LGBTQ advocates say could harm the physical and emotional health of transgender people within the church.The 14-page doctrinal note, titled “Moral Limits to the Technological Manipulation of the Human Body,” sets forth guidelines for changing a person’s sex, specifically with youth. The document, issued Monday, says Catholic hospitals “must not perform interventions, whether surgical or chemical, that aim to transform the sexual characteristics of a human body into those of the opposite sex, or take part in the development of such procedures.”Transgender Catholics have received a mixed response across the U.S. church. Some have found acceptance in specific parishes and rejection in certain dioceses, including those that bar church personnel from using trans people’s preferred gender pronouns. The bishops’ latest guidance to Catholic medical centers could prevent trans people from getting the health care they need, said Francis DeBernardo, executive director of New Ways Ministry, which advocates for greater LGBTQ acceptance in the church.Catholic hospitals make up a sizeable portion of the U.S. health care system and in some communities they are the only option. The Catholic Health Association, which comprises more than 600 hospitals and 1,400 long-term care and other health facilities in the United States, says more than one in seven U.S. hospital patients is cared for in a Catholic facility.“These decisions are being made at a much higher level without knowing the individuals and individual cases involved,” DeBernardo said. “When transgender people are not permitted or restricted from transitioning in ways they feel are appropriate, it could end in depression, anxiety or even self harm, including suicide.”The bishops’ guidelines “will not change much” when it comes to caring for transgender patients at Catholic hospitals, said the Rev. Charlie Bouchard, CHA’s senior director of theology and sponsorship. Transgender people will continue to always be accepted in Catholic hospitals and treated with dignity and respect, but might not receive all of the gender-affirming care they request because of the church's theological and moral teachings, he said.“As we look at the document from the bishops, what we are mindful of is that we have a history of caring for the marginalized, and we see transgender people very much as a marginalized group,” he said.Catholic hospitals see transgender patients with a variety of health care needs from broken bones to cancer treatment and heart attacks, Bouchard said, adding that the hospitals would not perform cosmetic procedures such as reconstructive surgeries, hysterectomies, or treatments such as sterilizations on request, unless there is a medical need for them.He said Catholic hospitals are also training staff to be respectful of transgender patients: “When a patient checks in, we ask staff to be respectful in how they ask questions. We want to affirm transgender individuals as persons and provide them with spiritual care and psychological counseling.”Bouchard said Catholic hospitals will “base health care on science and continue to follow the science when it comes to transgender people.”“But we don’t treat ideology,” he said. “We treat patients who are really suffering. There are things out there about gender fluidity that we do not agree with. But as Catholic hospitals, we are held to the same standard of care as other hospitals.”DeBernardo disagreed, saying the bishops’ doctrinal guidelines cause harm rather than heal people by not paying heed to science.“The bishops’ unwillingness to counter any of the evidence from the scientific community or the experience of transgender people is neither good theology nor acceptable pastoral care,” he said.DeBernardo said he sees hope with many more Catholics in the pews showing greater understanding of transgender people's lives. He noted cases where Catholic parents are supporting their transgender children against restrictive policies in Catholic schools, including barring puberty blockers and preferred pronouns on campuses and in parishes.Christine Zuba, a transgender woman who lives in New Jersey, said she feels accepted at her local parish, but is upset that the national church “continues to deny our existence and our need for health care.” Zuba said she was disappointed to see that transgender people were not even mentioned in the 14-page document.“In my parish, I feel accepted unconditionally for who I am,” she said. “But that is missing in our hierarchy. There is no willingness to engage with us and understand our lives.”Zuba said she is happy to see more engagement and interaction in some dioceses. In Davenport, Iowa, Bishop Thomas Zinkula formed a Gender Committee calling Catholics to “listen to the people in the margins,” calling ministering to LGBTQ people – particularly trans people – as “a life issue.” In a column published in the Catholic Messenger, Zinkula said he has been haunted by the story of a transgender youth who attempted suicide after being denied Communion.“This type of thing should never happen again,” he wrote.Zuba said she would like to see that type of commitment to listen and learn in the upper echelons of the church.“All we ask is listen to us as a group and as individuals,” she said. “Open your hearts and try to understand.”___Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846194,"France bans TikTok, Twitter from government staff phones","PARIS (AP) — France announced Friday it is banning the “recreational” use of TikTok, Twitter, Instagram and other apps on government employees' phones because of concern about insufficient data security measures.The move follows similar restrictions on TikTok in democratic countries amid fears about the popular video-sharing app's Chinese connections. But the French decision also encompassed other platforms widely used by government officials, lawmakers and President Emmanuel Macron himself.The French Minister for Transformation and Public Administration, Stanislas Guerini, said in a statement that ‘’recreational'' apps aren’t secure enough to be used in state administrative services and ’’could present a risk for the protection of data.”The ban will be monitored by France’s cybersecurity agency. The statement did not specify which apps are banned but noted that the decision came after other governments took measures targeting TikTok.Guerini's office said in a message to The Associated Press that the ban also will include Twitter, Instagram, Netflix, gaming apps like Candy Crush and dating apps.Exceptions will be allowed. If an official wants to use a banned app for professional purposes, like public communication, they can request permission to do so.Case in point: Guerini posted the announcement of the ban on Twitter.The U.S., Britain, the European Union and others have banned TikTok on government phones. Western governments worry Chinese authorities could force TikTok's Chinese owner, ByteDance Ltd., to hand over data on international users or push pro-Beijing narratives.The company's CEO, Shou Zi Chew, pushed back on assertions that TikTok or ByteDance are tools of the Chinese government during questioning by U.S. lawmakers Thursday. The company has been reiterating that 60% of ByteDance is owned by global institutional investors.A law China implemented in 2017 requires companies to give the government any personal data relevant to the country’s national security.

In November, McBride tweeted a picture of himself on the beach at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort and another photo inside Trump's 2024 campaign announcement party, McFadden wrote.""While lawyers—like all citizens—are entitled to speak freely, these public representations by McBride call into question the genuineness of his need for a medical continuance because of his inability to represent Quaglin last October,"" McFadden wrote.McFadden ordered McBride — who has since withdrawn from Quaglin's case — and another attorney for Quaglin, Jonathan Gross, to file a response by April 10 as to why the judge should not refer them to the court's committee on grievances, which investigates complaints against attorneys. The judge set a hearing for April 18.In response to a journalist's tweet about the judge's order, McBride tweeted: “EVERYONE SHOULD SHOW UP FOR THIS TO HEAR THE TRUTH. LET’S GOOOOO!”McBride withdrew from Quaglin's case this month — just weeks before the man's new April trial date — because McBride said he needed to focus on another Jan. 6 case headed to trial at the end of March. McBride told the judge that Gross would take over Quaglin's case, saying the switch wouldn't prejudice the defendant and that the other attorney “knows Quaglin’s case well.""Soon after taking over the case, however, Gross told McFadden he planned to ask for the trial to be pushed again. McFadden wrote that Gross told the judge “that he does not practice criminal law and that he is not competent” to be Quaglin's lead attorney at trial in just a few weeks.""Quaglin’s attorneys have now delayed this trial multiple times to the detriment of their client, who remains detained, and to the inconvenience of his co-defendants and the Government who seek a speedy resolution to this matter,"" McFadden wrote. “Indeed, the Court has doubts that McBride’s initial continuance request was made in good faith.”McBride said in a text message Friday that he denies the “insinuations"" in McFadden's order about his representations to the court about his medical condition and continuance requests. McBride said he will respond to the court and looks forward to “displaying the truth and achieving a favorable resolution.”McBride also said his client believed the judge had so much personal animus toward McBride that Quaglin didn’t think he could get a fair trial.“As such, Mr. Quaglin asked me to step aside and help Mr. Gross take over the case — which is exactly what I did,” McBride wrote.Gross did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.Quaglin is being held at the D.C. jail, where Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and others on the Committee on Oversight and Accountability visited Friday as some conservatives continue to try to portray Jan. 6 defendants as “political prisoners.”Of the 20 Jan. 6 defendants held in D.C. as of earlier this month, 17 were accused of assaulting officers at the Capitol, according to Just Security blog, which obtained a recent D.C. Department of Correction list. Six of the defendants have pleaded guilty to assaulting, resisting or impeding officers and two others have been convicted at trial.A spokesperson for the D.C. jail didn't immediately respond to a request Friday from The Associated Press for an updated list of Jan. 6 defendants locked up there.Quaglin, of North Brunswick, New Jersey, is accused of attacking several police officers trying to protect the Capitol from the angry pro-Trump mob that halted Congress' certification of President Joe Biden's victory.Authorities say Quaglin attacked officers with a stolen riot shield and sprayed them with a chemical irritant. He faces charges including assaulting an officer using a dangerous weapon.____Richer reported from Boston.",2023/03/25,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846196,Disabled Wisconsin voters say absentee law not followed,"MADISON, Wis. (AP) — Disabled voters say local election leaders across Wisconsin are not following federal law during early voting in the high-stakes race for state Supreme Court, incorrectly telling them they can't have another person return their absentee ballot for them.Absentee ballots, and who can return them, has been a political flashpoint in battleground Wisconsin, known for razor-thin margins in statewide races. The April 4 election will determine majority control of the state Supreme Court, with abortion access and the fate of Republican-drawn legislative maps on the line.Challenges to laws and practices in at least eight states that make it difficult or impossible for people with certain disabilities to vote have also arisen in the past two years. At the same time, there has been a push in many states to restrict rules affecting who can return absentee ballots.Wisconsin Republicans successfully sued last year to ban absentee ballot drop boxes, and the conservative-controlled state Supreme Court ruled that only the voter can return their ballot in person or place it in the mail.People with disabilities filed a federal lawsuit in response to the state court's decision, arguing that federal law allows them to get assistance in returning their ballot. A federal court ruled in their favor in August, noting that the Voting Rights Act applies to Wisconsin voters who require assistance with mailing or delivering their absentee ballot because of a disability.But in the lead-up to the April 4 Supreme Court election, and during early voting that began Tuesday, local elections officials are not following the law, advocates for the disabled allege. Absentee ballots were mailed to voters earlier this month and early, in-person voting using absentee ballots began on Tuesday.The Wisconsin Elections Commission, which oversees the state’s more than 1,800 local elections officials, first alerted clerks in September to the federal court ruling reiterating that disabled voters can have assistance returning absentee ballots.In recent weeks, the commission has reminded them of the law in conversations, webinar trainings, and newsletters, commission spokesperson Riley Vetterkind said Friday.“This is a reminder that voters with disabilities are entitled to receive assistance completing and delivering their absentee ballots,” the commission said in an email to all clerks on Feb. 3, less than three weeks before the primary. “Some jurisdictions are inserting absentee ballot instructions that say assistance is prohibited, without noting the important exception for voters with disabilities.”The message called the issue “especially significant” because of the court ruling affirming the right to assistance.“Please ensure that your absentee ballot instructions do not contradict the federal court’s order,” the commission implored.Barbara Beckert, external advocacy director of Disability Rights Wisconsin, said it was concerning that roughly a dozen communities around the state continue to have incorrect information on their websites, at polling places and being voiced by workers at the polls.Numerous voters have raised concerns, but all have wished to remain anonymous because they live in small communities and do not want their complaints to become public, she said. It’s impossible to know how many voters, or how many communities, may be affected by a misreading of the law, she said.Beckert provided links to websites in seven communities that had incorrect information currently posted.The fight over absentee ballot return rules is not unique to Wisconsin.All states allow third-party return of mail ballots, but the rules around that vary widely, according to Liz Avore, a policy adviser with Voting Rights Lab. Since 2021, 11 states enacted restrictions on third-party return and there have been 27 bills introduced on the topic in 14 states this year, she said.Most of those would not affect voters with disabilities, with the exception of measures in Arkansas, Minnesota, New York and Oregon, she said.In Wisconsin, Beckert is pushing for requirements that the right for disabled people to get assistance with filing an absentee ballot be posted at all polling places and be included with instructions sent to voters with their absentee ballot.The elections commission can vote to change the instructions that are sent to voters along with the ballots, but it would take a change in law to post wording at the polls saying that disabled people can have help returning absentee ballots. The commission, equally divided between Republicans and Democrats, frequently deadlocks on high-stakes votes. And the Republican-controlled Legislature has worked in recent years to make absentee voting more difficult, but been blocked by Democratic Gov. Tony Evers.___This story has been edited to correct that a law change is not required for the elections commission to change the instructions sent to voters along with the ballots.",2023/03/25,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846197,Women soccer leaders target breakthroughs in World Cup year,"LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) — In a World Cup year set to drive faster progress in women’s soccer, elections in Europe next month will have a global audience for a potential breakthrough in gender equity.Women soccer executives taking part in an annual joint FIFA-UEFA leadership course for them in Switzerland this month are keenly awaiting the result of votes on April 5 for seats on the ruling committees at both soccer bodies.The past decade has seen women receive a single protected quota place to sit at decision-making tables at each of FIFA and the six continental authorities such as UEFA.However, women have yet to win international soccer politics elections in direct contests against men. Quota seats have been treated as a closed limit rather than a door opening.That could change when the 55 member federations of UEFA meet soon in Lisbon with two options to make women the winners.Norwegian federation president Lise Klaveness is one of 11 candidates — the other 10 are men — for seven available seats on the UEFA executive committee.The president of England’s Football Association, Debbie Hewitt, is challenging incumbent David Martin of Northern Ireland for the FIFA vice presidency reserved for only the four British soccer nations.Klaveness’ campaign and progressive views — typically rare in soccer circles — have been seen as a cause célèbre for the advancement of women executives.“It’s very brave of Lise to step into the election process,” Australia’s delegate at the women’s leadership course, Amy Duggan, told the Associated Press. “I wish her the best of luck. I would hope that everybody who is voting understands that diversity and inclusion is needed to make our game bigger and better.”Klaveness and Hewitt are in a select group of a few female presidents among FIFA’s 211 members, and most federations which have a women leader also will play at the Women’s World Cup: Norway, England, co-host New Zealand, the defending champion United States and Canada.Still, the backdrop to Cindy Parlow Cone being elected to lead the U.S. Soccer Federation and Canada Soccer appointing Charmaine Crooks as interim president this month includes women players challenging previous leadership on issues like equal pay and lack of respect.France and Spain have also been in turmoil with key players speaking out. Norway’s Ballon d’Or-winning forward Ada Hegerberg exiled herself from the national team for years until returning last year at the time Klaveness, a former national team player, was elected president.“In the World Cup year it’s always disappointing to think some of our best players across the globe might not be on the world stage,” Duggan said. “I do hope that all sorts itself out.”Promoting more women into executive positions during the rapid professionalization of women’s soccer was a shared goal during the week-long course at a business management school in Lausanne. The FIFA-UEFA course has taught more than 100 students in the past four years.In Nigeria, federation board member Aisha Falode noted the shocked reaction of the men’s national team failing to reach the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.“Heaven was going to fall,” she told the AP. “We, the women, have qualified for every single World Cup since it started (in 1991) and it’s like nothing. The awareness is almost non-existent.”Falode, a former journalist who went on to run the Nigerian women’s league, said she could one day seek the federation presidency.“Is it equal? No, the numbers are still not adding up,” she said. “Is it much more difficult for the women? Yes, it is, let’s not pretend about it. Let us have fairness in football leadership.”Helping to teach the next generation of women in soccer is also a goal of the course.“We need to be able to mentor our young girls coming up and say, ‘Hey, you can do this,’” Andrea Johnson of Guyana said.Whatever the results of UEFA’s elections, women will take center stage in soccer’s main tournament in July-August in host countries eager to promote it well.“In Australia we are doing well,” Duggan said, “we are progressive.""___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/25,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846198,"Nola vs. deGrom, Ohtani highlight MLB's opening-day matchups","The Texas Rangers aren't wasting any time in seeing what they have in Jacob deGrom.The ace right-hander, who signed a five-year, $185 million contract with the Rangers in the offseason, will face Philadelphia's Aaron Nola when the 2023 Major League Baseball season opens next Thursday.All 30 clubs will be in action that day for the first time since 1968.This will be deGrom's fourth career opening day start. The two-time Cy Young winner got the nod from 2019-21 while pitching for the New York Mets. Texas has been cautious with deGrom during spring training after the 34-year-old reported tightness in his left side right before team workouts began in February.His work over the last month has been solid enough that the Rangers did not hesitate in making deGrom the seventh different pitcher to get the ball on opening day for the team in the last seven years.“Early, we had to hold him back a little bit, but we think he’s good to go,” new Texas manager Bruce Bochy said. “We have the day off after opening day, so we can cover him. We’re not looking for him to take us real deep in the game or anything. So this just makes all of the sense in the world to us.”Nola, by contrast, has been a fixture for the Phillies. The 29-year-old will make his sixth opening day start for Philadelphia. Only Hall of Famers Robin Roberts (12) and Steve Carlton (10) have started more season openers in Phillies' history.Eight Cy Young winners in all will take the mound on March 30, including Corey Kluber, who will make his first start for Boston when the Red Sox face Baltimore. Kluber is the first newcomer to start Boston's first game since David Price in 2016.Miami's Sandy Alcantara will the first Marlins pitcher to start four straight openers when he takes on three-time Cy Young winner Max Scherzer and the New York Mets. Alcantara, a unanimous choice for the NL Cy Young in 2022, will break a tie with Josh Beckett (2003-05) and Josh Johnson (2010-12) for most opening-day starts in club history. Scherzer is one of five pitchers since 1900 to record 10 or more strikeouts on opening day at least three times in their career.This is the second time in as many years that Cy Young winners will face each other on opening day. Cleveland's Shane Bieber and Kansas City's Zack Greinke met last spring.Angels star Shohei Ohtani, fresh off leading Japan to the World Baseball Classic title, will make his second straight opening day start for Los Angeles. Ohtani set career-highs last year in wins (15), ERA (2.33), strikeouts (216) and innings pitched (166). Ohtani and the Angels begin the season against Oakland left-hander Kyle Muller, who will be making his first opening-day start.New York Yankees ace Gerrit Cole will join C.C. Sabathia, Jack Chesbro and Mel Stottlemyre as the only pitchers in team history to start four straight opening days when the Yankees host the San Francisco Giants.Framber Valdez will start for World Series champion Houston when the Astros host the Chicago White Sox.The youngest opening-day starter will be Cincinnati's Hunter Greene. The hard-throwing 23-year-old will match up with Mitch Keller and the Pittsburgh Pirates. Greene struck out 164 hitters in 125 2/3 innings as a rookie last season. Greene also pitched 7 1/3 no-hit innings against the Pirates last April, only to take the loss.Washington's Patrick Corbin is hopeful that getting the start on opening day will lead to a better season than the ones he endured in 2021 and 2022. Corbin led the majors in losses each of the past two seasons, going 9-16 with a 5.82 ERA in 2021, then 6-19 with a 6.31 ERA last year. But with Stephen Strasburg still sidelined by injury and top prospect Cade Cavalli out for the year following Tommy John surgery, the Nationals are turning to one of the few pieces remaining from the team that won the 2019 World Series.HOSKINS TO GET 2ND OPINIONPhiladelphia Phillies first baseman Rhys Hoskins will get a second opinion on his injured left knee but the team believes Hoskins will miss all of the 2023 season.General manager Dave Dombrowski said while Hoskins will be re-evaluated, he would be “shocked” if the 30-year-old Hoskins did not require surgery to repair a torn ACL.Hoskins injured the knee Thursday while fielding a grounder. The Phillies will turn to Darick Hall to replace Hoskins. Hall, 27, hit .250 with nine home runs and 16 RBIs in 41 games as a rookie in 2022.“I do feel comfortable to say that we do like Darick Hall a lot,” Dombrowski said. “We think he's ready to step up and be a big-league player.”GOING THE EXTRA MILE(S)No more contract uncertainty for St. Louis Cardinals starter Miles Mikolas. The veteran right-hander signed a three-year, $55.75 million contract with the Cardinals that will carry through the 2025 season.The new deal replaces his current contract, a four-year deal signed in February, 2019 that covered the 2020-23 seasons and was set to expire this fall. Mikolas will receive a $5 million signing bonus payable July 1 and will make $18.75 million in 2023 and $16 million in each of the following two seasons. There are several award bonuses available to Mikolas, including $250,000 for winning a Cy Young.Mikolas is scheduled to make the second opening-day start of his career next Thursday when the Cardinals host Toronto. Mikolas went 12-13 with a 3.29 ERA last season while helping St. Louis to the NL Central title.“Miles stands among the top pitchers in the game today, and has continued to provide a steady presence for us both in the rotation and inside the clubhouse,” St. Louis general manager John Mozeliak said in a statement.ALL IN THE FAMILYGerrit Cole's head was down as he walked toward the New York Yankees dugout at the end of his final spring training start on Friday when something — or make that someone — caught his eye: Cole's 2-year-old son Caden.The younger Cole made his way to the railing next to the dugout, forcing Cole to switch gears immediately from his typically hyper-intense demeanor on the mound to well, simply being dad. He patted Caden on the head and later got down on one knee to chat with Caden's younger brother Everett — born in January — and wife Amy close by.“Honestly that’s one of the top moments of my career,” Cole told the YES Network after allowing one run in 5 2/3 innings with no walks and three strikeouts.

I look forward to more of those moments.”___AP Sports Writers Dan Gelston and Stephen Hawkins and AP National Writer Howard Fendrich contributed to this report.___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/25,,World

They are using fake accounts and have also taken over accounts from real community members who have already been arrested and had their phones taken. Please take extra caution online and offline, including with accounts that may have seemed legitimate in the past.”Egypt, though it technically does not outlaw homosexuality, frequently prosecutes members of the LGBTQ+ community on the grounds of ‘debauchery,' or ‘violating public decency.’ In 2017, it arrested seven for raising a rainbow flag at a rock concert. And arrests of homosexuals and non-gender conforming individuals remain common.An Egyptian government media officer did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Grindr's new measure.The warning to users comes after rights groups and media have reported how authorities in the wider region are increasingly taking to digital platforms to crack down on the LGBTQ+ community.In February, Human Rights Watch released a report documenting dozens of cases of security agencies in Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq and Tunisia extorting, harassing, publicly outing, and detaining LGBTQ+ people based on their activities on Facebook and Instagram, as well as the dating app Grindr. The publication also questioned major tech companies for not investing sufficiently in Arabic language content moderation and protection.“Grindr is working with groups on the ground in Egypt to make sure our users have up to date information on how to stay safe, and we are pushing international organizations and governments to demand justice and safety for the Egyptian LGBTQ community,"" said Grindr spokesperson Patrick Lenihan in response to a request for comment on Friday.A popular dating app for the gay, bisexual, transgender and queer community, California-based Grindr has faced criticism in the U.S. and been fined in Norway for sharing personal data with third parties that could potentially identify users.The privacy policy on the company’s website outlines how it uses and aims to protect user data.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846201,Everton accused of breaking EPL financial rules,"LIVERPOOL, England (AP) — The English Premier League referred Everton to an independent commission on Friday over an alleged breach of financial rules last season.Everton reported three-year losses of nearly 372 million pounds ($454 million). The league’s profit and financial sustainability rules allow clubs to lose a maximum of 105 million pounds ($128 million) over a three-year period or face sanctions.Those sanctions include points deductions for serious breaches.The league said proceedings before the commission will be confidential and heard in private.Everton said it was “disappointed” to be referred to the commission and was “prepared to robustly defend its position.”“The club strongly contests the allegation of non-compliance and together with its independent team of experts is entirely confident that it remains compliant with all financial rules and regulations.""Everton said it has provided information to the league “in an open and transparent manner” for several years and has “consciously chosen to act with the utmost good faith at all times.”Everton’s majority owner is British-Iranian billionaire Farhad Moshiri, a business partner of Russian metals tycoon Alisher Usmanov. Everton announced in March last year it halted its major sponsorship with companies belonging to Usmanov after he was sanctioned by the European Union in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.Everton avoided relegation by four points last season.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846202,"With eye on British Museum, Greece welcomes back ancient art","ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Greece on Friday welcomed the return of ancient artifacts from the Acropolis, furthering a campaign to press the British Museum to hand back a collection of sculptures taken from the ancient site in Athens more than 200 years ago.Culture Minister Lina Mendoni led a ceremony Friday for the repatriation of three sculpture fragments — representing a horse and two male heads — from the Parthenon temple on the Acropolis which had been kept at the Vatican Museums.“Initiatives like these show the way, how the pieces of the Parthenon can be reunited, healing the wounds caused by barbaric hands so many years ago,” Mendoni said.“This takes us to the just and moral demand of the entire Greek people, and of this government and its prime minister, for the final return of all the sculptures of the Parthenon.” The fragments will be added to the collection at the Acropolis Museum, which opened in 2009 at the foot of the ancient site in the center of the Greek capital.Mendoni said Greece would be willing to lend the British museum ancient Greek artifacts for exhibition to “fill the gap"" if the marbles were returned.“Greece cannot recognize possession and ownership by the British Museum because it considers the sculptures to be there as a product of theft,” she said.The Vatican called the return an ecumenical “donation” to Greece’s Orthodox Church, but the gesture added pressure on the London museum to reach a settlement with Greece following a campaign launched by Athens 40 years ago.“This act by Pope Francis is of historical significance and has a positive impact on all levels … We hope it sets an example for others,” the leader of Greece’s Orthodox Church, Archbishop Ieronymos II, said.Greece argues that the Parthenon sculptures are at the core of its ancient heritage, while supporters of the British Museum maintain that their return could undermine museum collections and cultural diversity globally.Carved in the 5th century BC, the sculptures from the Parthenon were taken in the early 19th century by British diplomat Lord Elgin before Greece won independence from the Ottoman Empire.Culture Ministry officials in Greece have played down remarks made last month by British Museum chair George Osborne that the U.K. and Greece were working on an arrangement to display the Parthenon Marbles in both London and Athens.Last year another marble sculptural fragment from the Parthenon temple — depicting a foot of the ancient Greek goddess Artemis — was returned to Athens from a museum in Palermo, Sicily.Bishop Brian Farrell, a Vatican secretary for promoting Christian unity, headed the visiting delegation to Athens and said the return of the three fragments from the Vatican had been discussed during a visit to Athens by Pope Francis in 2021.“The gifting of the fragments of the Parthenon which had been held in the Vatican Museums for more than two centuries, shows itself as cultural and social gesture of friendship and solidarity with the people of Greece,” Farrell said.“We assure you of our intimate joy at the realization of your legitimate wish to have the ... fragments at home in their place of origin,” he added.",2023/03/25,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846205,EU summit: European banking sector not in turmoil,"Responding to concerns of whether the banking turmoil which began in the US would spread to Europe, leaders of the European Union (EU) have said that the European banking sector is stable.On Thursday, the 27 leaders of the bloc gathered in Brussels as part of a two-day summit to talk about the current status of the European economy, as well as other issues pressing the Union, such as the war in Ukraine.President of the European Central Bank (ECB) Christine Lagarde joined the summit for economic talks.There have been concerns within the EU that, following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in the US, the fallout from Switzerland's Credit Suisse takeover could put European banks at risk.According to Bloomberg, shares of Germany's Deutsche Bank slumped as much as 15% on Friday, marking its biggest decline since 2020 and stoking further fears of a banking crisis.But German Chancellor Olaf Scholz told reporters in Brussels that there was no cause for concern, as Deutsche Bank had reorganized its business model and was a ""very profitable bank.""Prior to the EU leaders' meeting, Paschal Donohoe, Irish Minister for Finance and President of the Eurogroup, shared a similar voice of reasurrance: ""I'm confident in the resilience of our banking system at the moment. I think last year was a very good example of that, despite the outbreak of this terrible war on the people of Ukraine,"" he told reporters.""But we can never be complacent either, which is why the work of our regulators and future policy change is so important,"" he added.Meanwhile, Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis highlighted that the ECB had done a ""very good job"" in shoring up any potential banking crisis.Together with Italy, Portugal, and Spain, his country was severely impacted by the 2008 banking crisis, and memories of the strict austerity measures imposed by the EU at the time still linger in people's minds.""I would say there has been aggressive regulation by the ECB to ensure mistakes of the past will not be repeated,” Mitsotakis told reporters.Last week, the ECB raised interest rates by 0.5 percentage points as an inflation control measure amidst current financial tensions.""The euro-area banking sector is resilient, with strong capital and liquidity positions. In any case, the ECB's policy toolkit is fully equipped to provide liquidity support to the euro-area financial system if needed,"" the ECB said in a statement on Sunday.Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund of the United States (GMF) in Brussels told DW that this time, the European economy was not on the cusp of a major financial crisis, adding that what happened in 2008 had been very different.""The banking crisis which began with issues in the Silicon Valley Bank were somewhat idiosyncratic to banks in the United States, and also basically a supervisory failure by the Federal Reserve. And the issues in Credit Suisse are something markets have known for a long time,"" he said.""When Silicon Valley Bank collapsed, markets were already able to estimate whether rising interest rates would impact banks elsewhere buying government bonds. This was not the case in 2008,"" he added.But Kirkegaard highlighted that since banks are interconnected, concerns are valid. He believed this was the reason why the US government decided to act so forcefully when guaranteeing the safety of all deposits in the Silicon Valley Bank.""Within the EU, to secure banks further, momentum is needed in completing the European banking union plan,"" he added.The European banking union was formed in 2014 after the 2008 financial crisis shook the European economy. It seeks to harmonize banking laws and is meant to ensure that the bloc's banks can withstand financial crises without ""recourse to taxpayers' money.""But over the past years, this union has not had a solid European Deposit Insurance System (EDIS) to ensure all deposits are secured at a pan-European level.""Unfortunately, the problem here is that there are very longstanding political controversies. For example, one case is where the German government, among others, does not want to accept common deposit insurances until the Italian banks reduce holdings of Italian sovereign bonds. And it's sort of a stalemate. So I'm not particularly optimistic on that front,"" Kirkegaard said.After the meeting with other EU leaders, Donohoe told reporters that this disagreement was a matter for national parliaments to solve.German Chancellor Scholz told reporters that the banking union had made more capital accessible within the bloc, and had secured the current levels of stability.Meanwhile, French President Emmanual Macron told reporters that the banking union was not progressing fast enough. ""But the important part is done. Now, we need to go to the question of deposits. Several member states are hesitant, but France is not blocking,"" he said.While European shares continued to react to global market movements after the meeting with EU leaders had concluded, Donohoe said that there was still no reason to worry.""If I look at where the economy stands overall, we have an economy that's still growing, that has more people in work in it than ever before, and we have banks that, as I have said, have received the impact of different decisions made here in Europe in recent years regarding their capital, regarding their liquidity. I believe that is valuable, and we will see the benefit of that in the time ahead,"" he told reporters after the meeting.Kirkegaard highlighted that amid the ECB's recent interest rate hike and falling energy prices, inflation within the EU would also stabilize.""Obviously, those who are looking to buy a new house or engage in refinancing will face higher interest rates and will have an issue they will have to wade through in the coming months.

The four-time All-Star apparently was upset that a foul wasn't called when he missed a layup.Dallas was trailing 125-122 when Doncic caught a pass under the basket and his layup bounced off the back of the rim. After the Mavericks committed a foul to stop the clock, Doncic made the gesture.The NBA said the fine was for “an inappropriate and unprofessional gesture toward a game official.”Officials didn’t give him a technical over the gesture. Doncic frequently complains to officials and is one technical foul away from 16 this season, which would trigger a one-game suspension. The count doesn't carry over into the playoffs.Dallas owner Mark Cuban said he planned to protest the loss to the Warriors over a sequence late in the third quarter that led to an uncontested dunk for Golden State's Kevon Looney.The Mavericks thought they had possession coming out of a timeout and lined up on their offensive end. The Warriors inbounded on the other end with no defenders, leading to Looney's easy bucket for a 90-87 Golden State lead.Before the timeout, official Andy Nagy signaled possession for Golden State when the ball went out of bounds, but quickly pointed to the Dallas bench to indicate a timeout.The Mavs contended that official Michael Smith must have thought Dallas had possession because he was on the same end of the floor as the Mavs. Dallas believed officials should have stopped play to sort out the confusion.___More AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/25,,World

The 80-minute charmer follows 20-somethings Dom (“Industry’s” David Jonsson), sensitive and a little uptight, and Yas (Vivian Oparah), a lively free spirit, on one eventful day in South London. When they meet, they are strangers who are reeling from bad breakups and appear to be polar opposites. The feature debut of director Raine Allen-Miller and writers Tom Melia and Nathan Byron, “Rye Lane” has garnered comparisons to Richard Curtis in his heyday and had critics singing about Jonsson and Oparah’s terrific chemistry its freshness.— “Tetris,” a new film coming to Apple TV+ on Friday, March 31, explores the wild origin story of how one of the most popular video games of all time reached the world from its Soviet beginnings. Taron Egerton, sporting a Ted Lasso mustache, plays Henk Rogers, the American who secured the rights to distribute it globally from the Soviets and, specifically, Alexey Pajitnov, the Russian computer engineer who created the addictive block puzzle. Directed by Jon S. Baird, the film takes quite a few liberties with the truth to create suspenseful, comedic, Cold War-era thriller.— With over $2.3 billion grossed at the box office, there’s a good chance you (and everyone you know) has already seen “Avatar: The Way of Water,” James Cameron’s 13-years-in-the-making, $350 million, 3-hour-long spectacle that won over critics and audiences alike, despite over a decade of jokes about its cultural irrelevance. Now after months of playing in theaters only, you can finally bring Pandora to your living room. Starting Tuesday, it’ll be available to purchase digitally (its Disney+ release date has yet to be announced). The film left this critic (a self-proclaimed “Avatar” agnostic) dazzled and floating on a blockbuster high. But a big question remains: Will it have the same impact on the small screen?— AP Film Writer Lindsey BahrMUSIC— When Joni Mitchell was celebrated with the Library of Congress Gershwin Prize for Popular Song, the event was by invitation only.

Mitchell will sing George Gershwin’s “Porgy and Bess.”— Chlöe — the elder half of Chloe x Halle — is releasing her solo debut, “In Pieces,"" on Friday, March 31. The 14-track album has features by Chris Brown (on ”How Does It Feel""), Missy Elliott (on “Told Ya”) and Future (on “Cheatback”). The cover art depicts Chlöe holding a colorful, crystalline version of her heart. “I hope this project brings healing to those who listen, as it’s been completely therapeutic for me,” she wrote on social media.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846211,DEA overseas review barely mentions corruption scandals,"NEW YORK (AP) — After nearly two years and at least $1.4 million spent, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration on Friday released an external review of its overseas operations that barely mentions recent corruption scandals and offers recommendations that critics dismissed as overly vague.Much of the 50-page report outlines the DEA's sprawling, 69-country “foreign footprint,"" while lauding its efforts to plug gaping holes in the oversight of undercover money laundering operations and special vetted units overseas.""This report is stunningly vague in its actual evaluation of known problems at the DEA and remedies to fix them,"" said Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee. “This speaks to the agency’s broader effort to evade oversight. The agency has attempted to dodge my oversight inquiries but I intend to push forward.""The external probe was announced in 2021 following reporting by The Associated Press on the crimes of José Irizarry, a disgraced former DEA agent now serving a 12-year federal prison sentence after confessing to laundering money for Colombian drug cartels and skimming millions from seizures and informants to fund an international joyride of fine dining, parties and prostitutes.Irizarry told the AP last year that DEA agents have come to accept that there’s nothing they can do to make a dent in the flow of illegal cocaine and opioids into the United States that has driven more than 100,000 overdose deaths a year.“The drug war is a game,” Irizarry said. “It was a very fun game that we were playing.”Irizarry's case got one paragraph in the external review. An ongoing federal grand jury inquiry into some of his jet-setting former DEA colleagues was mentioned in a footnote. Also, Irizarry's lawyer told AP he offered to make his client available for an interview for the review but was never contacted.“Interviews and documents demonstrated that the DEA has already largely implemented the recommendations from the DOJ OIG to enhance the oversight of compliance risks arising out of the agency’s foreign operations,” the review concluded, referring to the U.S. Justice Department's Office of Inspector General.The probe found fault with the bureaucracy it said bogs down the assignment of agents to foreign divisions and recommended putting incentives in place to attract “top talent to hard-to-fill offices.” It also blamed the “corrupting influence” of cartels for instances of ""individual misconduct by DEA personnel.”""DEA also could do more to ensure supervisors are effectively evaluated and ultimately held accountable for compliance-related issues,"" the review found.Other recommendations included more regular audits of foreign offices and vetted police units, and stricter controls on expenses.The external review was conducted by former DEA administrator Jack Lawn and Boyd Johnson, a former federal prosecutor who handled international drug cases. Public records show the no-bid contract was awarded to the law firm WilmerHale, where Johnson works, at a cost of $1.4 million. Johnson did not respond to emails seeking comment.The report made little mention of the turmoil that has roiled DEA operations in Mexico, where law enforcement cooperation collapsed amid the tenure of a regional director who was quietly ousted from his post for having improper contact with lawyers for narcotraffickers.AP reported earlier this year that Nicholas Palmeri served just 14 months in the post and retired before an Office of Inspector General report found he sought government reimbursement to pay for his own birthday party.“For a report that cost the government over $1.4 million, it does not seem to recommend the types of changes that would actually prevent another Irizarry or other misconduct,"" said Bonnie Klapper, a former federal prosecutor in New York. “While the report is very thorough in laying out DEA’s role and responsibilities, it mentions only a very few examples of misconduct, and its recommendations don’t go far enough.”Palmeri arrived to Mexico in the wake of one of the biggest setbacks in recent years in the U.S.-led drug war: the botched arrest of former Mexican Defense Secretary Salvador Cienfuegos. The retired general was nabbed on a sealed U.S. drug warrant upon arrival at the Los Angeles airport in 2020 only to be released a few weeks later under pressure from Mexico’s leftist president, who retaliated by disbanding an elite police unit that was a key DEA ally.Neither the Cienfuegos incident nor the arrest of another prominent U.S. ally in Mexico — ex-security chief Genaro Garcia Luna — are mentioned in the report.“The report’s key takeaway about improving information sharing and breaking down internal silos couldn’t be more commendable,” said John Feeley, a retired U.S. diplomat who worked alongside the DEA in numerous postings overseas. ""But the biggest silo that needs to be dismantled from an operations perspective is the DEA’s failure to communicate to front offices and ambassadors when it’s investigating senior officials of host nations.”DEA Administrator Anne Milgram, who has declined repeated interview requests, said in a statement that the agency would implement all 17 of the report's recommendations.“DEA is committed to meeting the challenges presented by today’s global drug threats and ensuring that our work is conducted at the highest level possible,” she said.__Goodman reported from Miami.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846212,March Madness: Low-cut sneakers gain traction on court,"DENVER (AP) — The squeaks from the sneakers on the court sound the same. But these are far from your classic Chuck Taylors or vintage Air Jordans. Or any version of high tops at all.The iconic shoe designed to extend slightly over the ankle has pretty much fallen out of favor in the lanes across basketball.Glance down at the footwear the players are lacing up for March Madness and many are wearing a version of a low-top sneaker (with the occasional mid-cut throw in).It’s a way to put their fastest, most comfortable, foot forward, especially since studies are inconclusive on whether high tops actually do what they were intended to do — prevent sprained ankles.As Colorado guard Kindyll Wetta points out, “we get our ankles taped anyway, so I don’t feel like I need the extra high-top support.”There’s also fashion to consider and ""low tops,"" TCU guard Damion Baugh said, ""just look better.”High tops had been a familiar sight since the dawn of Converse’s Chuck Taylors a century ago. As the legend goes, Taylor walked into the company's sales office looking for footwear that didn't hurt his feet. The result was an All-Star sneaker that would eventually bear his name — featuring a high, canvas collar — and land Charles H. ‘Chuck’ Taylor in the Basketball Hall of Fame. He helped spark an industry — Converse had an estimated 80% share of the market at one point.Over the decades, there have been many styles and models of high tops — from Nike’s Air Force 1 to the Reebok Pump to the iconic versions of Air Jordans. The thought behind them was simple — protect the ankle from rolling, almost like a hiking boot.But the injury data on low tops versus high tops has proven inconclusive.Dr. Howard Osterman, the team podiatrist for the Washington Wizards and Mystics, recently gave a lecture on the history of basketball shoes. He discussed various sneakers, including Walt “Clyde"" Frazier's signature line with Puma (a low top) and George “Iceman” Gervin's Nike shoe “Blazer"" (high top) through the modern day.Osterman's best advice after his deep dive into footwear?“Find a shoe that's comfortable,” he said. “The shoes don’t necessarily make you a better player, but they certainly can create irritation and other problems.”Matt Powell, a shoe industry analyst who tracks the latest trends through his consulting firm, believes the surge in low top popularity mirrors the soaring demand for comfy running sneakers.“What a lot of the brands have done is they’ve tried to make their basketball shoes look more like running shoes, so they’re more on trend with what’s selling,” Powell said. “The player is looking for a shoe that’s as light as it could possibly be, and still protect their feet. So that points you to the low top.”The late Kobe Bryant gets a big assist for the popularity of low tops. He once helped launch a lower-profile shoe.These days, NBA standouts such as Giannis Antetokounmpo, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Luka Doncic and LeBron James have shoe lines with versions of a low top.On the women's side, Nike recently announced that WNBA standout and Oregon record-setter Sabrina Ionescu has a new low-cut shoe line called “Sabrina 1.”“All the best shoes are low tops,” TCU guard Mike Miles Jr. said. “All the comfortable shoes.”One of the first things Gonzaga forward Anton Watson does when he steps on the court is size up his competition.Their shoes, anyway.And if you happen to be wearing a nice pair, he will let you know.“I've got to say something like, ‘Where did you get those? I’m gonna need a pair of those,’” said Watson, whose team beat UCLA to move on to the Elite Eight.He’s tried high tops in the past, but they felt too cumbersome.Tennessee guard Jordan Walker grew up wearing high tops but has worn a lower version in college.“My parents wouldn’t let me wear low tops — it’s no ankle support and all of this,” Walker said. “I had to wear ankle braces with the high tops. So I get to college, and I got to express my freedom a little bit and go to the low tops.”Overhearing the shoe question, Tennessee coach Kellie Harper weighed in.“High tops,"" said Harper, who helped the Lady Vols to three straight national titles as a player. ""I’m a high top girl.”Harper added they don’t make high tops the way they did in the 1990s. She played in a scrimmage with her team recently and put on some high tops. Harper noticed they came up only about three-quarters compared to what she used to play in.“They were making fun of my shoes because they were going way over the ankles,” Harper said.Creighton center Ryan Kalkbrenner wears a mid-cut shoe — or so he thinks.“I don’t know what the difference is between three-quarter and traditional. Honestly, I just know mine are a lot higher than most of my teammates,” Kalkbrenner said. “I couldn’t even tell you the name of the shoe.""As for those old-school high tops, Baylor forward Jalen Bridges has just one thought.""I don’t know how people used to play in those,” Bridges cracked. “This new generation of hoopers, we just like low cuts.”___AP Sports Writers Teresa M.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846213,"ConocoPhillips details gas leak cause, remedies at hearing","ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — ConocoPhillips, which last week received U.S. government approval for the massive Willow oil drilling project in Alaska, detailed reasons for a natural gas leak at another North Slope field that prompted the evacuation of 300 employees last year.Officials with the company said that pumping 170 barrels (27,028 litres) of diesel fuel, a freeze-prevention fluid, into a disposal well caused a component to fail and led to the subsequent leak, the Anchorage Daily News reported.ConocoPhillips officials spoke Thursday at an Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission hearing in Anchorage about the 2022 leak at the Alpine field in northern Alaska. Delayed recognition allowed the leak to continue for days, and the company had not anticipated the shallow underground zone to contain significant amounts of gas.Erica Livingston, a wells chief engineer for ConocoPhillips Alaska, said the well design has been used many times previously without issues. However, it was not cemented in the area of the zone where the leak occurred because that area was not expected to have gas.Cementing the well in that area, located about a half mile underground, would have prevented the leak, she said. No gas was detected beyond the drilling site, and no one was harmed by the gas, Livingston said.The leak at the CD1 drill site began Feb. 27, 2022 but wasn’t detected until March 4, 2022. During that time, 7.2 million cubic feet (203,881 cubic meters) of natural gas was released before they were able to capture it.About 300 personnel were evacuated from the site, which caused concern in the nearby village of Nuiqsut and an investigation by the commission, which oversees oil field operations in Alaska.Livingston said the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is also investigating. She called the incident a “significant event” that became a learning opportunity for the company.ConocoPhillips, the largest oil producer in Alaska, said the company has increased monitoring of pressure at wells and outlined pressure limits and solutions when those are exceeded.Rosemary Ahtuangaruak, the mayor of Nuiqsut, a community 8 miles (13 kilometers) from the drill site, was one of two members of the public who testified by phone during the hearing.She said residents hope to learn more about the leak in order to prevent future incidents, especially since Willow will be located about 35 miles (56 meters) west of Nuiqsut. Ahtuangaruak has been vocal in her opposition to the Willow project.“This event gave our community members much concern,” she said. “We want to fully understand to prevent this from happening at the new development that will be nearby our community.”Commission chairperson Brett Huber said the commission will prepare a final report that could include enforcement measures. No timeline for the report’s release was given, and Huber declined to answer questions until it is made public.",2023/03/25,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846225,Michigan 1st state in decades to repeal 'right-to-work' law,"LANSING, Mich. (AP) — Michigan, long known as a mainstay of organized labor, on Friday became the first state in decades to repeal a union-restricting law known as “right-to-work” that was passed over a decade ago by a Republican-controlled Legislature.The state's “right-to-work” law had allowed those in unionized workplaces to opt out of paying union dues and fees. Its repeal is seen as a major victory for organized labor with union membership reaching an all-time low last year.""Today, we are coming together to restore workers’ rights, protect Michiganders on the job, and grow Michigan’s middle class,” Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said in a statement Friday after signing the legislation.The second-term governor also signed legislation restoring a prevailing wage law that had been repealed by Republicans in 2018. It requires contractors hired for state projects to pay union-level wages.Repealing the “right-to-work” law, enacted in 2012, had long been listed as a top priority for Democrats, who took control of the full state government this year for the first time in 40 years.Supporters of the repeal poured into the state Capitol in Lansing earlier this month as the House and Senate took up the legislation before approving it along party lines after limited deliberations.“It’s a new day here in Lansing,” Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks said prior to the vote. ”It’s time to once again make Michigan known as a place where workers want to come.""Democrats had argued that the law allowed for “free riders” that received union representation without having to pay fees or dues. Without it, unions can now require all workers in a unionized workplace to pay fees for the cost of representation in bargaining.Michigan had the nation’s seventh-highest percentage of unionized workers when the “right-to-work” law was enacted in 2012, but that dropped to 11th in 2022. Over the past decade, union membership in Michigan has fallen by 2.6 percentage points as overall U.S. union membership has been falling steadily for decades, reaching an all-time low last year of 10.1%.Michigan becomes the first state in 58 years to repeal a “right-to-work” law, with Indiana repealing its in 1965 before Republicans there restored it in 2012. In 2017, Missouri's Republican Legislature approved a “right-to-work” law, but it was blocked from going into effect before voter's overwhelmingly rejected it the next year.In total, 26 states now have “right-to-work” laws in place. There were massive protests in Indiana and Wisconsin in recent years after those legislatures voted to curb union rights.In Michigan, thousands of union supporters descended on the state Capitol to protest in 2012 when the Republican-controlled Statehouse pushed the “right-to-work” legislation through without hearings.Neighbored by state's with “right-to-work” laws, Republicans say the repeal will lead to Michigan becoming less attractive to businesses and will lead to forced union membership. House Republican leader Matt Hall said in statement following Whitmer's signing that “businesses will find more competitive states for their manufacturing plants and research and development facilities.”Small Business Association of Michigan President Brian Calley, who was lieutenant governor when the law was passed in 2012, said the repeal “eliminates the right of workers to decide for themselves if they wish to join a union.”The legislation Whitmer signed also includes $1 million in appropriations, which Republicans say is to ensure they are “referendum-proof.” The Michigan Constitution states that bills with appropriations attached to them are not subject to a public referendum in which voters could reject the law.Whitmer promised in her 2019 State of the State speech to “veto bills designed to cut out the public’s right of referendum.”The Democratic governor on Friday also signed legislation repealing a third-grade reading law that required students to repeat the grade if they test more than one grade level behind in reading and writing.",2023/03/26,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846226,"California eases water restrictions, but drought isn't over","DUNNIGAN, Calif. (AP) — California Gov. Gavin Newsom ended some of the state's water restrictions on Friday because a winter of relentless rain and snow has replenished the state's reservoirs and eased fears of a shortage after three years of severe drought.Newsom was careful not to declare the drought to be over, noting water shortages remain in the Klamath River basin along the California-Oregon line and in densely populated Southern California, which relies heavily on the struggling Colorado River system to supply millions of people.But Newsom did say he would stop asking people to voluntarily cut their water use by 15%, a request he first made nearly two years ago while standing at the edge of a nearly dry Lopez Lake in the state's Central Coast region — a lake that today is so full from recent storms it is almost spilling over.“None of us could have imagined ... a few months ago that we'd be where we are today,” Newsom said Friday from a farm northwest of Sacramento that has flooded some of its fields with excess water so it will seep underground and refill groundwater basins. “Are we out of the drought? Mostly — but not completely.”Newsom's call for voluntary conservation had mixed results. Californians did reduce their water use, but only by 6.2% overall, according to data from the State Water Resources Control Board. Newsom never ordered statewide, mandatory water restrictions — but he did require water agencies to impose some limits on their customers.Friday, Newsom said he was easing those rules. That change will impact people in different ways depending on where they live. For most people, it means they won’t be limited to watering their lawns on only certain days of the week or at certain times of the day. Other restrictions will remain in place indefinitely, including a ban on watering decorative grass for businesses.“We’ve got to conserve as a way of life,” Newsom said.Newsom could ease some restrictions in part because California's reservoirs are now so full that cities will get more than double the amount of drinking water this year compared to a previous allocation announced last month. Now, water districts that serve 27 million people will get at least 75% of the water they requested from state supplies. Last year, they only got 5% as California endured three of the driest years ever since modern recordkeeping began in 1896.“This wet winter, which has led to a large increase in our (water) allocation, is not a signal that we can relax,"" said Adel Hagekhalil, general manager of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California that supplies water to 19 million people. ""It is an alarm to act and accelerate our efforts to respond to rapidly changing conditions, including conservation, storage, recycling and reuse.”Last week the district ended mandatory drought restrictions for about 7 million people who rely almost exclusively on state supplies for their water.California and the western United States have been in an extended drought for about two decades, a period of abnormal dryness punctuated by occasional intense seasons of storms. It would be tough for a governor “of a large, diverse state that has very diverse water supplies and water demands” to say when a drought has started or ended, said Jay Lund, vice director for the Center for Watershed Sciences at the University of California, Davis.Lund said the drought is over from many perspectives in California, including urban water supply and reservoirs. But it's not over for the state's fragile ecosystems and the groundwater aquifers that were depleted during recent drought years.“We might never recover them completely,” he said.Three years of little rain or snow in California had depleted reservoirs to the point the state couldn't generate electricity from hydroelectric power plants. It dried up wells in rural areas and state officials had to truck in water supplies for some communities. And it reduced the flow of the state's major rivers and streams, killing off endangered fish and other species.But since December, no less than 12 powerful storms have hit California, packing so much rain and snow that meteorologists call them “atmospheric rivers.” These storms have flooded homes, closed ski resorts and trapped people in mountain communities for days with no electricity, prompting emergency declarations from President Joe Biden.“That kind of whiplash is something that we’ve experienced in a very intense way in California that I think is unique across the western U.S.,” said Karla Nemeth, director of the California Department of Water Resources.Water has been steadily pouring into the state's reservoirs since December. Of California's 17 major reservoirs, 12 of them are either at or above their historical averages for this time of year.And more water is coming. Statewide, the amount of snow piled up in the mountains is already 223% above the April 1 average — the date when the snowpack is typically at its peak. Most of that snow will melt in the coming months, flowing into reservoirs and posing more flooding threats downstream.",2023/03/25,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846227,Tribe urges Army to speed up return of child's 1879 remains,"Federal authorities expect to return a 13-year-old boy's remains to his Native American tribe in South Dakota this fall, they said Friday. The statement comes days after the tribe urged for a faster return of the child who died at a federal boarding school for Indigenous children in 1879.The Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate wrote to the head of the U.S. Army's cemetery office this week, demanding movement on their effort to have the remains of Amos LaFromboise repatriated from a graveyard at the Carlisle Barracks, a military facility in Pennsylvania.The letter from three lawyers with the Native American Rights Fund to Army Cemeteries Executive Director Karen Durham-Aguilera describes the child as the son of one of the tribe's most celebrated leaders, Chief Joseph LaFromboise, who signed an 1867 treaty that established their current reservation boundaries.The Office of Army Cemeteries emailed a statement saying that Amos LaFromboise's disinterment was approved a year ago and that the Army also told the boy's family and the tribe's chair last summer that his remains will be returned in 2023. His disinterment will be entirely at the Army’s expense, the office said.“The Army currently plans to conduct the disinterment of Amos this September and the required Federal Register Notice will be published in the next 60 days,” according to the statement.The tribe argues that the Army has been requiring repatriation standards that are more demanding than those in the federal Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, mandating a signed affidavit from the child’s closest living relative, which can be difficult or impossible for 19th century remains.“Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate expected Amos to return home from Carlisle Indian Industrial School,” they wrote, “to lead his people like his father and serve as a model for future generations of Tribal leaders.”Lawyers for the tribe said Friday their request stands to have Amos LaFromboise repatriated under the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act and that the tribe is willing to discuss the next steps.Amos LaFromboise died 20 days after his arrival at Carlisle the year the school opened. The tribe's letter says the Army has previously dug up and reburied his remains at least three times in three different locations. The Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate want to bury him next to his father on the Lake Traverse Reservation in northeast South Dakota.Tribe historians say six children of tribal leaders were sent to Carlisle in 1879. Three of the boys died there and a fourth passed away shortly after he returned home.At a ceremony two years ago to return nine disinterred remains of Rosebud Sioux children, U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said forced assimilation practices at Indian schools stripped away the children's clothing, language and culture.The Carlisle school put children through harsh conditions that sometimes resulted in their deaths. Founded by an Army officer, the school cut their braids, dressed them in military-style uniforms and punished them for speaking their native languages. European names were forced upon them.More than 10,000 Native American children were taught there and endured harsh conditions that sometimes led to death from such diseases as tuberculosis. There have been several rounds of disinterment and repatriation at Carlisle in recent years.",2023/03/25,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846228,Memphis player charged over punch in handshake line,"BOWLING GREEN, Ohio (AP) — A Memphis basketball player has been charged by Bowling Green campus police with assault after punching a Falcons player in the handshake line following a Women’s NIT game, according to the Bowling Green athletic department.“Violence is never acceptable and our priority remains the health, safety and support of our student-athlete, who is recovering and doing well,” the athletic department said in a statement Friday. “This is an active investigation in conjunction with the City of Bowling Green Prosecutor, and no further comment is available at this time.”As the teams walked toward center court Thursday night following Bowling Green's 73-60 win in the Round of 16 game, Memphis' Jamirah Shutes stopped to talk with the Falcons' Elissa Brett. After a short conversation, Shutes appears to throw a punch at Brett's face. Brett fell toward the scorer’s table and onto the sideline.There was no immediate word about what caused the confrontation.Bowling Green coach Robyn Fralich didn't directly comment on the incident after the game, saying only that they were “figuring all those things out,” as far as what happened in the handshake line.Memphis' athletics department said Friday that the incident was ""extremely unfortunate and certainly not consistent with, or representative of, our expectations for our programs and student-athletes.”“Because the incident occurred after the game, jurisdiction falls in the hands of local authorities, and we are cooperating fully with their process,"" the statement said. ""To be respectful of that process, we will not comment further until it is complete.”Later Friday, the school announced that coach Katrina Merriweather was resigning to take a job at another school. The statement, posted on social media, said that the coach had decided to move on before the incident in the game Thursday night.The Memphis Commercial Appeal newspaper reported that Shutes, who leads the Tigers in scoring, took an elbow to her face with 24 seconds left in the opening quarter and played just eight minutes in the first half. She returned to start the second half.Shutes, a fifth-year player who finished with 13 points in her final game with the Tigers, was a second-team All-AAC selection this season.Brett scored 15 points in the win.___AP women’s college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/womens-college-basketball and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/25,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846229,Geothermal developer wants to delist endangered Nevada toad,"RENO, Nev. (AP) — In an unusual move that could pit two Biden administration agencies against each other, the developer of a planned Nevada geothermal power plant says it intends to sue U.S wildlife officials to overturn the endangered species listing of a toad in adjacent wetlands.Ormat Technologies said in a 60-day notice of its intent to sue the Interior Department's Fish and Wildlife Service that the listing of the Dixie Valley toad in December was illegal.“The toad does not meet the definitional standard for a threatened — let alone endangered — species, and the service failed to base its decision on the best scientific and commercial data available,"" Reno-based Ormat said.It’s the latest legal maneuver in a series of conflicts underscoring challenges President Joe Biden faces in vowing to protect fish and wildlife while also pushing the development of so-called green energy projects on U.S. lands to help combat climate change.A court battle over the toad’s listing would put the administration in the precarious position of using its Justice Department lawyers to defend the wildlife service’s decision to list the toad, while continuing to defend the Bureau of Land Management’s approval of the geothermal project in a lawsuit brought by conservationists and a tribe.The Interior Department, which oversees the Fish and Wildlife Service and the BLM, had no comment, spokesman Tyler Cherry said.The project planned about 100 miles (161 kilometer) east of Reno is among three in Nevada at the forefront of Biden’s push to speed the transition from greenhouse-emitting fossil fuels to cleaner energy sources.The other two, which also face opposition from environmentalists and/or Native American tribes, are lithium mines intended to produce a key element in electric vehicle batteries.The Center for Biological Diversity and the Fallon Paiute-Shoshone Tribe first sued the BLM in federal court in Reno in January 2022 seeking to block the construction of the geothermal plant — a case that has already made one trip to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.Ormat is a formal intervenor in that case, with its own lawyers arguing alongside the Justice Department lawyers representing the BLM.The opponents say pumping hot water from beneath the earth’s surface to generate carbon-free power would adversely affect the levels and temperatures of surface water critical to the survival of the toad. The hot springs that feed the wetlands are sacred to the tribe.The service concluded in its listing decision that the geothermal project posed the single biggest threat to the toad and that “threatened species status is not appropriate because the threat of extinction is imminent.”The decision came after the agency temporarily listed the speckled, quarter-sized amphibian on an emergency basis in April 2022, which marked only the second time in 20 years it had taken such emergency action.The notice gives the wildlife service 60 days to “come into compliance” with the Endangered Species Act or face a lawsuit seeking to rescind the listing.“The species is not currently in danger of extinction,” Jessica Woelfel, Ormat's general counsel, wrote Wednesday.The listing was “based on an outdated project design, inflated possible harms and disregard for Ormat’s mitigation plan,” Woelfel wrote. She said it doesn't reflect a scaled-back plan to initially build a much smaller 12 megawatt power plant, instead of two capable to producing 60 megawatts.Patrick Donnelly, the Center for Biological Diversity's Great Basin director, said the organization is confident the listing of the toad as an endangered species will hold up in court.""There’s widespread consensus among government and independent scientists that this geothermal project puts the Dixie Valley toad at risk of extinction,"" Donnelly said. “The only ones who disagree are those on Ormat’s payroll or at the Bureau of Land Management.”Last summer, the San Francisco-based appellate court refused to grant a temporary injunction blocking construction of the power plant the bureau approved in December 2021.But just hours after that ruling, Ormat announced that it had agreed to temporarily suspend all work on the project until this year. Then, in late October, the company asked for the case to be put on hold while it developed a smaller plan in anticipation of the endangered species listing.Ormat said in its notice of intent to sue that the wildlife service knew the company was in the process of scaling back the size of the initial project when the agency issued the listing decision.“As a result of Ormat’s proposal, BLM rescinded the 60 MW project approval and issued a new one for 12 MW ... just days after the final listing rule,” the letter said.“Any assessment of risk associated with a project five times larger than the approved project capacity is completely irrelevant,"" it said. ""A 60 MW project cannot currently threaten the (toad) because it literally does not exist.”",2023/03/25,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846230,"Knight Foundation leader to retire, leaving powerful legacy","Alberto Ibargüen announced Friday that he was stepping down as the leader of the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, ending a run as the grantmaker’s president that began in the George W. Bush administration. With about $3 billion in assets, Knight is among the 50 wealthiest foundations.During his tenure, Ibargüen made his mark in the cities where brothers John S. and James L. Knight operated their newspaper empire. In Detroit, Ibargüen helped orchestrate a $370 million foundation effort to keep the city’s finances from cratering. In Miami, he crusaded for the arts, helping the city become an international cultural destination. And as a former newspaper executive who saw the news industry being decimated all around him, Ibargüen made it a top priority at Knight to restore the credibility and viability of journalism in response to the upheaval caused by the internet.Ibargüen, 79, was born in Puerto Rico and grew up in New Jersey. After serving in the Peace Corps and working as a legal-aid lawyer earlier in his career, he climbed the newspaper ranks. He served as publisher of the Miami Herald when it won three coveted Pulitzer Prizes and publisher of the Spanish-language El Nuevo Herald in Miami.Ibargüen’s career in newspapers helped set the way he ran the foundation. He expected his colleagues at Knight to scout out leads like reporters and be the foundation’s eyes and ears on the ground in the communities they serve. Those around him said he embraced the chaos of a newsroom environment and wasn’t afraid to slam the brakes on a project when something juicier presented itself.“I don’t find it very useful to say, ‘We only do this,” or ‘We only do that,’” he says. “Setting rules up ahead of time never struck me as that creative.”Ibargüen will depart when Knight finds a replacement. In the meantime, he is still busy trying to put together what he hopes is a mammoth fund to support journalism. Ibargüen isn’t certain how much the fund will gather from other foundations — although he said ”$1 billion is just an ante” for the work that needs to be done. It also is unclear whether the fund will touch on all areas of journalism, including First Amendment issues, technology development, supporting small news outlets, and helping people become more discerning readers and viewers of the news.Ibargüen says several dozen foundations have said they are interested in joining in. Diversifying Knight’s board in terms of race, gender, and ideological perspective, Ibargüen says, was one of his biggest accomplishments. Upon realizing that a tiny percentage of Knight’s endowment was managed by investing firms owned by people of color, Ibargüen developed a survey of foundations and universities with a goal of diversifying endowment money managers.At Knight, Ibargüen has managed to remain faithful to the wishes of the Knight brothers, while keeping the foundation’s work at the cutting edge, says John Palfrey, president of the MacArthur Foundation and a trustee on Knight’s board until December.Ibargüen’s response in Detroit, where the Knights ran the Detroit Free Press, was both in line with the brothers’ commitment to the city but also represented a different kind of involvement in city finances than the Knights had envisioned, suggested Palfrey. Rather than supporting the arts or community programs, the money Knight contributed to the Grand Bargain went to pay the city’s pensioners, traditionally a municipal, not philanthropic, responsibility.Similarly, Ibargüen showed that he was not bound to the past when he steered Knight away from endowing journalism professorships at universities. But he jumped at the chance to re-establish the practice when doing so was an attempt to promote equity, Palfrey says. The result, the Center for Journalism and Democracy at Howard University, is led by journalist Nikole Hannah-Jones.Ibargüen worked to set up the center after Jones, who oversaw an extensive New York Times look at the legacy of slavery in the United States, the 1619 Project, when she was at first denied tenure at University of North Carolina’s Hussman School of Journalism and Media, another institution that has received support from Knight. Within weeks of the University of North Carolina decision, Knight, MacArthur, the Ford Foundation, and an anonymous donor provided a total of $20 million for the new center at Howard.One of the biggest injuries the media revolution has inflicted on the news business is the disconnection people feel between their geography — their city and neighborhood — and the news they consume online, which tends to be national in scope, Ibargüen says. As Knight struggled to support new ways to deliver the news by making grants to outlets across the country, Ibargüen also was obsessed with driving home a single story in his hometown: the arts matter.“Art bridges language and bridges experience,” he says. “If Gloria Estefan is singing, your toes will tap, I guarantee it. And if Beethoven is playing, your soul soars.” Even more, a city where residents are connected through shared cultural offerings can be an essential part of a strong democracy in which political differences are recognized but not demonized, Ibargüen says.Franklin Sirmans, who moved to Miami in 2015 to serve as director of the Pérez Art Museum Miami, says Ibargüen’s strong leadership has been key to making Miami an arts scene.“He has an incredibly persuasive, beautiful, and poetic way of talking about it. I hate to use Alberto’s own terms so closely, but over the past seven years, I have struggled to find my own words.”The city has been transformed by the injection of arts fund, and today Miami is “committed to being a place that is open for dialogue,” Sirmans says. “It’s a place that doesn’t shy away from having difficult conversations. Rather, it is a place that is led by art, a place where art is the catalyst for every single thing that we do.”____This article was provided to The Associated Press by the Chronicle of Philanthropy.

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Friday at the end of a three-day conference on global water resources during which developing nations made urgent calls for help with cleaner drinking water and better sanitation.“All of humanity’s hopes for the future depend, in some way, on charting a new course to sustainably manage and conserve water,” Guterres said in his closing remarks.This includes rational use of water for agriculture and more aggressive action against climate change, he said, and water “needs to be at the center of the global political agenda.”The U.N. World Water Development Report, issued on the eve of the conference, says 26% of the world’s population — 2 billion people — don’t have access to safe drinking water and 46% — 3.6 billion people — lack access to basic sanitation. U.N. research also shows that almost half the world’s people will suffer severe water stress by 2030.The conference included many verbal pledges to improve water supplies, but fewer detailed commitments translating ambition into improved daily life for ordinary people.““We have such beautiful, ambitious policies, but in a way they are unfeasible,” said Lina Taing, senior researcher at the global think tank United Nations University.She said when it comes to getting people clean water and sanitation, “we know that we are completely off track."" Taing said the world needs to increase its actions “four times.”Throughout the conference, water-stressed nations, particularly those in the developing world, told U.N. members of their need for international aid to provide their people with drinking water and sanitation systems.“Waging a war on two fronts simultaneously, to address water issues and climate change, is no mean feat, especially for a small island nation like Kiribati which has very limited resources at its disposal,” said Teburoro Tito, U.N. representative from the island nation of fewer than 200,000 people in the middle of the Pacific.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846234,Protesters in Suriname demand president resign,"PARAMARIBO, Suriname (AP) — A few hundred protesters gathered in Suriname’s capital on Friday to demand that the president of the South American country resign.They accused the administration of President Chan Santokhi of trying to postpone the 2025 general election, which can’t be organized until legislators amend an electoral law as required by a court ruling last year that aims to create a fairer voting system.Earlier this week, the government set up a committee that submitted two proposals to amend the electoral law, with Santokhi saying the bill would be presented to legislators within two months. But activists are demanding that the law be approved within a week, even though the chairman of Suriname’s National Assembly warned Thursday that that won’t be enough time.Activist Maisha Neus said she would organize more protests if there’s a delay.“We will hit them where it hurts. Economically,” she said.It is the second such protest since mid-February, when demonstrators stormed Parliament to decry the end of government subsidies that has led to a spike in the cost of power, fuel and water. The mob clashed with police that day, who arrested at least 126 people after initially being taken aback by the fury and size of the crowd.This time, police outnumbered protesters, and officials set up barricades around the presidential office and Parliament.“Is this democracy, keeping your people behind a fence?” one demonstrator yelled.The protests come as Santokhi’s Cabinet implements cost-cutting measures ordered by the International Monetary Fund as it phases out subsidies on electricity, water and fuel. The current inflation rate is 58%, and increases in cost-of-living expenses are angering many.There is no prospect of sudden relief given that Suriname has not received any money from the IMF for about a year because the government has not met the targets imposed. The IMF agreed to loan Suriname $690 million in December 2021, but only $100 million so far has been released.",2023/03/25,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846235,Column: Cinderella tries to claim a title at March Madness,"Cinderella is no stranger at March Madness.From George Mason to VCU to Loyola of Chicago, there are some scintillating Final Four runs that keep hope alive for the little guys.But winning a national title?That's a far taller mountain to climb. So daunting, in fact, that not one of our beloved underdogs has done it. Not even Loyola, which seemingly had a higher power on its side with Sister Jean.Which brings us to Florida Atlantic, a school that finds itself in the midst of one of those magical runs.The Owls are one win away from the Final Four as they get set to face Kansas State in the East Regional final at hallowed Madison Square Garden on Saturday.Let's get one thing straight before we go any further: Florida Atlantic is a darn good basketball team, no matter its No. 9 seeding. The Owls have lost only three games all season, which is dwarfed on the record line by their 34 wins.“We don’t feel like we’re Cinderella,” guard Alijah Martin said. “We feel like we’re supposed to be here, doing exactly what we’re supposed to do.”They've been fortunate, too, which is usually required for a deep tournament run.After winning the first NCAA Tournament game in school history with a last-second basket against Memphis, the Owls caught a break in the second round when they drew an even bigger underdog than themselves: Fairleigh Dickinson, just the second No. 16 seed in tournament history to bounce a No. 1.Facing the undersized Knights instead of Big Ten powerhouse Purdue, Florida Atlantic advanced to the penultimate weekend with a 78-70 triumph.There was nothing fluky about the Owls' 62-55 victory over fourth-seeded Tennessee at MSG on Thursday night, and it wouldn't be a major surprise if they knock off No. 3 Kansas State to earn a chance to play on the biggest stage of all in Houston. FanDuel Sportsbook lists the Owls as just a 1.5-point underdog.(For what it's worth, the last time Kansas State made it this far in the tournament was 2018. They lost to 11th-seeded Loyola by 16 points in the regional final.)If the Owls are still on their feet after Saturday, they'll run up against some really formidable odds in the Lone State State.Since the NCAA began seeding every tournament team in 1979, the largest number to win it all was No. 8 Villanova. The Wildcats pulled off a stunning upset of defending national champion Georgetown in the 1985 title game, but they were hardly some out-of-the-blue finalist.Villanova and Georgetown were both members of the Big East, at the time the mightiest men's basketball conference in all the land. In fact, a third Big East team, St. John's, also reached the Final Four that year, losing to the Hoyas in the semifinals.That '85 tourney also was the first with 64 teams, which essentially ushered in the current format.Since then, seven teams from the bottom half of the bracket have made it all the way to the Final Four, including the aforementioned George Mason (2006), VCU (2011) and Loyola, which all were No. 11 seeds.The others were 11th-seeded LSU in 1986, No. 9 Wichita State in 2013, No. 10 Syracuse in 2016 and No. 11 UCLA two years ago.But here's the thing: None of those seven teams got past the national semifinals. Until now, midnight always struck the Saturday before the championship game.Not much longer. Sooner than later, someone is going to crash through that barrier.There's more parity in the college game than ever before, largely thanks to the transfer portal and NIL. The greatest shocker in tournament history is there for the taking.It might even be claimed by the Owls, who've only been playing Division I hoops for three decades and are playing in the tournament for the first time since their initial one-and-done appearance as a 15th seed in 2002.Florida Atlantic may be short on history — the Boca Raton-based school was only established in 1961 — but it has grown to more than 30,000 students. The athletic program has tediously worked its way up the ranks in the ever-changing conference landscape, bouncing from the Trans America to the Sun Belt to Conference USA to, starting this summer, the American.While still lacking the tradition and gravitas of a prominent conference affiliation, the Owls can offer up booming South Florida, with its myriad of Name, Likeness and Image opportunities, and a chance to spend winters soaking up rays at the beach.Clearly, it's a pretty appealing package. Of the nine players who took the court against Tennessee, three are transfers from major-college programs, while another arrived through the junior-college ranks.Now, this band of vagabonds is three wins away from the most unlikely of national titles.And they all feel right at home.“We’re where we’re supposed to be,” guard Nick Boyd said. ”We’re going to keep moving, keep working. We’re going to stay humble and hungry. I can’t count us out no more. We’re here to stay and we’re going to keep fighting no matter who we line up against, who we play.""Maybe this is the year Cinderella finally stays out past midnight.___Paul Newberry is the national sports columnist for The Associated Press.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846239,ACLU: Lawsuit likely if Nebraska bill on trans health passes,"LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) — Now that a Nebraska bill to ban gender-affirming treatments for minors has cleared its first and toughest hurdle, parents and children likely to be affected by the measure are preparing for a legal fight, the American Civil Liberties Union said Friday.“It's discriminatory on the basis of sex,” said Jane Seu, policy counsel with the Nebraska ACLU. “It also violates the free speech rights of doctors.”The bill — which has led opposing lawmakers to stage an effort to filibuster every bill before the Legislature this session — would outlaw gender-affirming therapies such as hormone treatments, puberty blockers and gender reassignment surgery for those 18 and younger. It would also ban Nebraska doctors from referring minors to other providers — even those in another state — for such treatment.Republican lawmakers on Thursday advanced the bill from the first of three rounds of debate on a largely party-line vote. But even if enacted this year, opponents say the fight to stop it and other measures targeting the transgender community will shift to federal court, where a nearly identical measure on trans health in Arkansas has already been temporarily shut down. A federal judge has also blocked enforcement of the law in Alabama.The American Civil Liberties Union is representing the families of transgender youth suing Arkansas over its ban, which was temporarily blocked in 2021 by a federal judge who’s considering whether to strike the prohibition down. U.S. District Judge Jay Moody said in his ruling that those suing were likely to succeed on their arguments that the bill is unconstitutional.The temporary injunction was upheld last year by the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which also oversees federal cases in Nebraska.That could spell legal trouble for the Nebraska bill if it's enacted, as the Nebraska bill is nearly identical to the Arkansas measure, Seu said. The ACLU is focused on defeating the bill before it can become law, but Seu acknowledged that it's preparing for a legal fight on behalf of transgender kids.“We are talking to families,” she said. “They've been contacting us, because they're scared.”Some of those families testified about that fear during a hearing for the bill last month. That includes Rachel Ogborn, who sobbed as she detailed repeated emergency room trips with her despondent child about the time puberty began.“I'm here today so I don't lose my child,” Ogborn said. “I know that sounds extreme, but so is this bill.”The care she sought led to therapy and treatment for her child that included testosterone blockers and estrogen.“I went from having a suicidal, depressed, self-harming son who didn't see himself in the future at all, to having a happy, healthy daughter who smiles and talks at the dinner table,” she said.At least seven other states besides Arkansas and Alabama have enacted laws restricting or banning gender-affirming care for minors: Arizona, Georgia, Iowa, Mississippi, Tennessee, Utah and South Dakota. A proposed ban is pending before West Virginia’s governor. Nearly two dozen states are considering bills this year to restrict or ban care.",2023/03/25,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846240,"Miami women hold on, beat Villanova for 1st trip to Elite 8","GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) — The horn sounded and Miami coach Katie Meier turned to start jumping and hugging her staff as players and cheerleaders sprinted past for a meet-at-midcourt celebration. She soon made her way into the crowd to embrace players hollering with delight.Soon she emerged through the other side to trade hugs and high-fives with a front-row section of Hurricanes fans.An improbable and emotional ride to the program's first Elite Eight appearance in the women's NCAA Tournament was worth sharing with as many people as she could.“I can’t believe it,” Meier said afterward. “I’m not going to act cool. This is awesome.”Jasmyne Roberts scored a career-high 26 points — including a stick-back for the go-ahead, three-point play with 38.8 seconds left — to help Miami overcome blowing a 21-point lead and beat Villanova 70-65 on Friday, pulling the program to within a win of the Final Four.Miami had reached the Sweet 16 only once before, in 1992. Now the Hurricanes will play Sunday for the Greenville Region 2 title against third-seeded LSU.The ninth-seeded Hurricanes (22-12) looked dominant in building a huge lead, wobbly in blowing it. But they hung on down the stretch after Villanova made its push back behind the latest big-scoring effort from Associated Press first-team All-American Maddy Siegrist.“I can’t even explain the feeling really,” guard Haley Cavinder said.The celebration said plenty. While Meier made her way to the fans, Roberts stayed locked in a firm and emotional embrace with teammate Ja’Leah Williams. The sophomore guard picked a perfect time to come through with a huge performance by making 10 of 16 shots and all six of her free throws while pulling down nine rebounds.“Cool Hand Luke is her new nickname. She doesn’t even know that movie,"" Meier said, referencing the Paul Newman movie released more than three decades before Roberts' birth.Siegrist, the nation's scoring leader, had 31 points, 13 rebounds and five steals for fourth-seeded Villanova (30-7). It marked her third 30-point outing in as many tournament games, pushing her to the No. 2 single-season scoring total in Division I history.Yet it wasn't enough down the stretch, with Siegrist coming up empty in a couple of key moments late. The first came when she posted up Destiny Harden inside, but a quality look on a turnaround hit the backboard before coming off the rim with her team down just 67-65.Moments later, after a Miami free throw, Siegrist missed from the other side of the lane as Villanova had a chance to extend the game. Instead, Miami secured the rebound, and Roberts hit clinching free throws with 11.1 seconds left for a two-possession lead.Miami originally appeared to be headed for a much easier finish.The Hurricanes spent much of the first half using their athleticism and aggressiveness to take control, both in scoring off the dribble and attacking the glass. The Hurricanes led 46-33 by halftime then used a stunning 8-0 burst in the opening minute of the second half, ending when Harden scored on a drive through contact from Siegrist for a three-point play that pushed Miami to a 54-33 lead.Villanova responded by throwing fullcourt pressure to get back into the game. The Wildcats scored 14 straight points to end the third quarter then took a 60-59 lead on Siegrist's free throws with 5:31 left to cap a 23-2 run, a stretch that had Roberts saying the Hurricanes “did kind of lose our composure for a little bit.”That set up a tense finish with neither team leading by more than two until the final 30 seconds. Villanova took its last lead at 65-64 when Lucy Olsen banked in a drive with 49 seconds left before Roberts answered with the and-1.“My mistake,” Villanova coach Denise Dillon said. “We should have in the first half shown some more of the pressure, the press, but you think just a team that’s quick like that can take advantage. But again, just waited a little too late to make that run.”Consider it the latest entry in a wild NCAA novel for the Hurricanes. They first rallied from 17 down to beat Oklahoma State. Then Harden hit the late shot to win at 1-seed Indiana and get them back to the Sweet 16 for the first time in 31 years.Now they have a chance to play for — and celebrate — a whole lot more.SIEGRIST'S FUTUREAn emotional Siegrist fought back tears during her postgame news conference, and offered a hint of finality when asked about plans that could include returning to school or pursuing the WNBA.“I’ve got to talk to my parents and stuff like that after,” she said. “But I couldn’t be more grateful for the opportunity to have played here. So many good people, and it’s really about the people. Take the basketball part out of it, like the memories and the people are something that I’m going to cherish forever.”TIP-INSSiegrist closed with 37 straight 20-point games, which the NCAA said is the longest streak by any men's or women's Division I player this century. ... Christina Dalce had 13 points, eight rebounds and five blocks to help Villanova do a better job of battling Miami inside after halftime. ... Harden had 15 points and nine rebounds for Miami, which took a 43-32 rebounding advantage. ... The Wildcats made just 2 of 16 3-pointers.___Follow Aaron Beard on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/aaronbeardap___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/25,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846241,Trump rally falls during anniversary of Waco's dark past,"AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Former President Donald Trump picking Waco, Texas, for the first rally of his 2024 campaign Saturday will put him in the middle of a big Republican state that has reliably delivered him big crowds.It will also put him not far from the grassy prairie where a standoff in 1993 between U.S. law enforcement and Branch Davidians infamously resulted in the deaths of more than 80 members of the religious cult and four federal agents.This year marks the 30th anniversary of the siege, which continues to hold deep symbolism and is still viewed by survivors of the compound as an act of unwarranted government intrusion.Trump, who is facing the possibility of becoming the first president in U.S. history to be indicted, hasn't nodded to Waco's past since first announcing the rally last week. Campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said the decision to hold the event at Waco's regional airport was ideal because the city was “centrally located and close"" to some of Texas' largest cities.A closer look at Waco's history:___THE STANDOFFFederal agents raided the compound about 10 miles east of Waco on Feb. 28, 1993. They were trying to arrest sect leader David Koresh for stockpiling illegal weapons, but Branch Davidian members had been tipped off about the raid and a shootout ensued. Four agents and six Davidians were killed that day, leading to what would become a 51-day standoff.As the weeks dragged on, federal authorities said they were becoming increasingly worried about the Davidian children possibly being abused. Then on April 19, 1993, after an FBI negotiator shouted over a loudspeaker for Koresh to lead his people out and “be a messiah, not a destroyer,” military vehicles began ramming the buildings and spraying tear gas inside.A few hours later, flames were seen spreading through the compound. Authorities said the Davidians died by suicide by setting the fire and shooting themselves. Survivors have denied there was a suicide pact, saying military vehicles knocked over lanterns and ignited the blaze.Nearly a dozen Davidians went on trial; all were acquitted of murder and conspiracy to commit murder charges. But five were convicted of voluntary manslaughter and weapons charges, and three were convicted on weapons charges.____THE AFTERMATHToday, a white chapel at Mount Carmel on the site of the former compound attracts visitors who are greeted by a wall of stones engraved with each victim’s names at the property entrance. In Waco, federal agents hold remembrances each year on the anniversary of the deadly raid, and Netflix released a new documentary about the siege that coincides with the 30th anniversary.But for some far-right extremists and militia groups, the siege has become a touchstone over the decades, most notably the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing that happened on the same day two years after the raid. A Virginia man charged with joining the mob that stormed the U.S. Capitol allegedly told an undercover agent that his property could turn into “Waco 2.0"" while expressing concerns over new firearm regulations, according to a federal court filing.____TRUMP'S LEGAL TROUBLESTrump is coming to Texas as New York prosecutors are wrapping up their probe into whether Trump engaged in an illegal hush money scheme involving a porn actress. Trump, who has denied any sexual encounter with Stormy Daniels, raised the specter on his social media site of “years of hatred, chaos and turmoil” if charges are brought.He has long railed against federal law enforcement. When his Mar-a-Lago club was searched by the FBI last summer as part of an investigation into the possible mishandling of classified documents, he broke the news by declaring that his home was “currently under siege, raided, and occupied by a large group of FBI agents.”____WACO TODAYThe Houston Chronicle's editorial board accused Trump of “stoking the fires of Waco” in a column published this week.But there is no doubt Trump picked solidly Republican territory in Waco, where he won surrounding McClennan County by more than 20 points in 2020. The city includes Baylor University, the nation's largest Baptist university, and is the headquarters of ""Fixer Upper"" stars Chip and Joanna Gaines' home decorating empire.City officials said this week they were ready for the rally.“It's a lot of eyes, national attention,” said Jonathan Cook, Waco's director of parks and recreation.____Associated Press reporter Jill Colvin contributed to this report.",2023/03/26,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846242,Minnesota nuclear plant shuts down for leak; residents worry,"MONTICELLO, Minn. (AP) — A Minnesota utility began shutting down a nuclear power plant near Minneapolis on Friday after discovering water containing a low level of radioactive material was leaking from a pipe for the second time. While the utility and health officials say it is not dangerous, the issue has prompted concerns among nearby residents and raised questions about aging pipelines.Xcel Energy discovered in November that about 400,000 gallons (1.5 million liters) of water containing tritium had leaked. The utility made a temporary fix but learned this week that hundreds more gallons of tritium-laced water leaked, leading to the shutdown decision.After the plant cools over the next few days, workers will cut out the leaking pipe, which is over 50 years old, said Chris Clark, Xcel Energy's president. The utility will then have the pipe analyzed in hopes of preventing future leaks, he said.“We could have continued to safely operate the plant and simply repair the catchment, but then, of course, there is always a risk that it would spill over again and have more tritium enter the groundwater,"" Clark told reporters near the Monticello Nuclear Generating Plant, about 35 miles (56 kilometers) northwest of Minneapolis. “We didn't want to take that chance, so we're bringing the plant down.”Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety with the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the fact there was a second tritium leak “shines a light on the problem of maintaining aging pipelines” underground at older nuclear plants.The temporary closure could be out of an abundance of caution, “or it could be a sign they don’t know how bad the problem is, and they need to do a deep dive to find out what’s going on,’’ he said.Clark said the tritium isn't a risk to drinking water in Monticello or the nearby city of Becker, saying the cities take their water from different areas of the Mississippi River. Even if the tritium reached the river, which Clark assured wouldn't happen, it would dissipate within a few yards, he said.Clark said the spill had not left the utility’s property.The utility reported the initial leak to state and federal authorities in late November but didn't make it widely public until last week, raising questions about transparency and public health issues. State officials said they wanted to wait for more details before sharing information widely. Criticism about the delay played a role in Xcel's decision to hold a public information session Friday.Tritium is a radioactive isotope of hydrogen that occurs naturally and is a common byproduct of nuclear plant operations. It emits a weak form of beta radiation that does not travel far and cannot penetrate human skin, according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.Cindy Remick, of Becker, attended Friday's information session and said she still has concerns that nearby residents, especially those who rely on well water, will be safe. Remick also worries about whether the radioactive material could hurt wildlife.“We have a very large population here of eagles, and I would like to make sure they're not impacted,” Remick said. “Minnesota is known for our wildlife, and if that (tritium) escapes their plant into the Mississippi, that could be very damaging.”Tyler Abayare, who was fishing at the Mississippi River near the plant, said he’s been coming to the river every day for five years and usually sees about 15 to 20 others fishing as well.“Typically this time of year, there’s a lot of families that come out and fish with their children,"" he said. ""Now, after the media released what happened, there’s not a soul in sight, and it just takes away from the recreation and passion of fishing.”Abayare said he doesn’t believe that the Mississippi River is safe. He doesn’t eat fish he catches and no longer ties his line with his teeth to avoid getting sick.Nuclear Regulatory Commission inspectors are monitoring the shutdown and repairs, said Victoria Mitlyng, a spokesperson for the agency. She said in a statement the leak “does not present a safety challenge to the public, to drinking water supplies, the plant or the environment.” The leak also did not exceed any agency limits.Clark said Xcel Energy already had planned to shut down the plant April 15 for nearly a month for refueling, and it wasn't clear if it would immediately reopen after the leak is fixed.Clark said the leaking pipe is part of the original plant, which opened in 1971. Xcel has applied to extend its operating license at Monticello through 2050.“We want to inventory the age of everything in the plant and be sure we're dealing with whatever we need to update,” he said.Tim Judson, executive director of the Nuclear Information and Resource Service, a group that opposes nuclear power, said the second leak “is obviously concerning"" and that public worries about possible health risks are exacerbated by the recent toxic train derailment in Ohio, where residents remain concerned about possible health effects despite government pledges that air and water are safe.“People are seeing what happened in Ohio, and they are distrustful of the government response,’’ Judson said.___Daly reported from Washington.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846243,Florida Legislature moving quickly on DeSantis priorities,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — From expanding gun rights to going after “woke” investors, the Florida Legislature is quickly moving on a list of bills that will give Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis conservative-pleasing policy successes as he prepares to launch a presidential campaign.The usually slow-moving Legislature ended the week by sending DeSantis bills to shield businesses and insurance companies from lawsuits, allow any Floridian to get a government-paid voucher for private schools and an affordable housing bill that prevents local governments from enacting rent control ordinances.“We have a lot of the governor's priorities in a really good spot. We'll pass them,” House Speaker Paul Renner said Friday as lawmakers went home for the weekend. “We're moving quickly ... Some of what the governor has proposed is monumental and good, and we support it 100%.""That will give DeSantis more time to boast about successes while avoiding any perception of infighting if his priorities are held hostage until the closing moments of session.When the 60-day session opened, DeSantis predicted his priorities would pass quickly.“They are mindful that it’s probably better not to have kind of an eight-car pileup the last week of session where the whole agenda gets through in the last 72 hours,” DeSantis said. “I think you’re going to see more earlier.”DeSantis signed one of his priority bills during a private ceremony Friday. The new law creates more hurdles for people suing private companies and expands on legislation passed over the past year aimed at reining in skyrocketing property insurance rates.“Florida has long been known as a ‘judicial hellhole’ due to the legal system’s incentivizing of excessive and frivolous lawsuits,"" DeSantis tweeted. “I signed a series of reforms that will protect Floridians and our economy from predatory lawsuits.”But opponents said it's a giveaway to insurance companies at the expense of consumers.“The new law does nothing to protect Floridians and everything to protect the profits of billionaire insurance corporations,” Curry Pajcic, president of the Florida Justice Association.The Legislature also sent DeSantis a bill Friday to make it illegal for state and local investment funds to consider the environmental, social and governance stances companies support. One of DeSantis's biggest talking points is fighting back against “woke” corporations.“It’s a form of Marxism being pushed by unelected officials, progressives that hate our country and some of the largest investment firms in the world,” Republican Rep. Bob Rommel said of the investment strategy he called “corporate activism.”Democrats opposed the bill.“We are talking about things that are not real — corporate activism,” Democratic Rep. Michele Rayner-Goolsby scoffed. “I don’t know what corporate activism is.”The House also sent DeSantis a bill aimed at increasing the availability of affordable housing and boosting assistance programs for families looking for housing. While it largely received bipartisan support, some Democrats opposed it because it will also keep local governments from enacting rent control ordinances at a time when rents are climbing quickly.On Thursday, the Legislature sent DeSantis a bill that expands the state's school voucher program to anyone. On Friday, the House passed a bill to allow concealed carry of guns without a permit for anyone legally allowed to own a gun — another DeSantis priority. The Senate is expected to pass the gun bill.Lawmakers are also expected to pass bills soon to address illegal immigration and to ban abortion after six weeks of gestation, both DeSantis priorities.Lawmakers often wait until the final week of session to resolve some of the most important policy issues as they negotiate details and trade votes. Not this year.Even the bottom line of the state spending proposals presented by the House and Senate this week aren’t too far from the $115 million plan DeSantis outlined Feb. 1. Lawmakers have plenty of time to get the budget done, unlike some recent years when lawmakers had to stay late or come back to finish the work.“The slow pace of session,” Renner laughed Friday while talking about what's already been done in the first three weeks of the process.",2023/03/25,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846244,Teachers press school safety in wake of Denver shooting,"DENVER (AP) — Colorado teachers flooded into the state Capitol Friday to press for better protections for students and school staff after a 17-year-old Denver student shot two administrators, fled to the mountains and killed himself.Roughly 1,500 teachers and their supporters called for improved school security, more mental health support and tighter gun control measures, adding to pressure on lawmakers a day after students and parents converged at the Capitol to make similar demands.School shootings are becoming increasingly frequent in the U.S., and teachers at the rally voiced the fears they feel during safety lockdowns that are now regular occurrences.They also raised questions about the circumstances surrounding Wednesday's shooting at East High School, which came as the boy was being patted down for weapons, a daily requirement because of his behavioral issues including a pending firearm charge, according to school officials.Some East High School teachers at Friday's rally said they did not know any students at the school were being regularly patted down until the shooting.“I want to go into a building every day where I don’t need to ask if my kids are getting a pat down because I know nobody is bringing guns into the school,” said English teacher Josh Garfinkel.Schools were canceled Friday in Denver in response to the shooting. Officials have said they'll put armed officers into city high schools through the remainder of the school year, reversing a policy enacted just a few years ago in response to protests over racial injustice following the killing of George Floyd by police.The teachers Friday gathered on the steps in front of the Colorado capitol for speeches and chants, then circled the building as some played brass instruments and drums before filing inside.Elementary school teacher Raegan Haines said she’s had three lockdowns at her school this year. She said lawmakers need to make it harder to access guns.“You think, what am I going to do with these kids? How can I keep these kids quiet? Who am I going to put my body in front and why do I have to make that choice?”She added that when the teachers entered the Capitol, “we had to walk through metal detectors and everything is plated in gold. We don’t get that same sense of security at schools.”Colorado Democrats hold majorities in both state chambers and have made gun control a priority.Pending bills would expand who can petition to temporarily remove a firearm from someone who poses a danger, raise the minimum age to possess a firearm from 18 to 21, require three-day waiting periods after buying guns, and ban semi-automatic firearms.The semi-automatics ban is unlikely to find traction. The fate of the others could fall to Colorado Gov. Jared Polis. He's supported expanding red flag laws but not specifically endorsed raising the age to possess guns or the three-day waiting period.Teachers said their students also face more mental health problems and not enough social workers or psychologists to help.At East High School, about a half-dozen psychologists and social workers at East High must take care of 2,500 students, said Kristy Skarphol, a math teacher at the school. This year they’ve also been reaching out to teachers who might be struggling amid all the lockdowns.“We’re just spread way too thin for what we need,” Skarphol said.___Associated Press reporter Matthew Brown contributed from Billings, Montana.___Bedayn is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846245,"Utah social media law is ambitious, but is it enforceable?","Utah's sweeping social media legislation passed this week is an ambitious attempt to shield children and teens from the ill effects of social media and empower parents to decide whether their kids should be using apps like TikTok or Instagram.What's not clear is if — and how — the new rules can be enforced and whether they will create unintended consequences for kids and teens already coping with a mental health crisis. And while parental rights are a central theme of Utah's new laws, experts point out that the rights of parents and the best interests of children are not always aligned.For instance, allowing parents to read their kids' private messages may be harmful to some children, and age verification requirements could give tech companies access to kids' personal information, including biometric data, if they use tools such as facial recognition to check ages.“Children may be put at increased risk if these laws are enforced in such a way that they’re not allowed to some privacy, if they are not allowed some ability for freedom of speech or autonomy,"" said Kris Perry, executive director of the nonprofit Children and Screens: Institute of Digital Media and Child Development.The laws, which will go into effect in a year, impose a digital curfew on people under 18, require minors to get parental consent to sign up for social media apps and force companies to verify the ages of all their Utah users. They also require tech companies to give parents access to their kids' accounts and private messages, which has raised alarms for child advocates who say this could further harm children's mental health by depriving them of their right to privacy. This is especially true for LGBTQ+ kids whose parents are not accepting of their identity.The rules could drastically transform how people in this conservative state access social media and the internet, and if successful, serve as a model for other states to enact similar legislation. But even if the laws clear the inevitable lawsuits from tech giants, it's not clear how Utah will be able to enforce them.Take age verification, for instance. Various measures exist that can verify a person's age online. Someone could upload a government ID, consent to the use facial recognition software to prove they are the age they say they are.“Some of these verification measures are wonderful, but then also require the collection of sensitive data. And those can pose new risks, especially for marginalized youth,” Perry said. “And it also puts a new kind of burden on parents to monitor their children. These things seem simple and straightforward on their face, but in reality, there are new risks that may emerge in terms of that that collection of additional data on children.”Just as teens have managed to obtain fake IDs to drink, they are also savvy at skirting online age regulations.“In Southeast Asia they’ve been trying this for years, for decades, and kids always get around it,” said Gaia Bernstein, author of “Unwired,” a book on how to fight technology addiction.The problem, she said, is that the Utah rules don’t require social networks to prevent kids from going online. Instead, they are making the parents responsible.“I think that’s going to be the weak link in the whole thing, because kids drive their parents insane,” Bernstein said.There is no precedent in the United States for such drastic regulation of social media, although several states have similar rules in the works.On the federal level, companies are already prohibited from collecting data on children under 13 without parental consent under the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act. For this reason, social media platforms already ban kids under 13 from signing up to their sites — but children can easily skirt the rules, both with and without their parents’ consent.Perry suggests that instead of age verification, there are steps tech companies could take to make their platforms less harmful, less addictive, across the board. For instance, Instagram and TikTok could slow down all users' ability to mindlessly scroll on their platforms for hours on end.The laws are the latest effort from Utah lawmakers focused on children and the information they can access online. Two years ago, Gov. Spencer Cox signed legislation that called on tech companies to automatically block porn on cell phones and tablets sold, citing the dangers it posed to children. Amid concerns about enforcement, lawmakers in the deeply religious state revised the bill to prevent it from taking effect unless five other states passed similar laws — which has not happened.Still, child development experts are generally hopeful about the growing push to regulate social media and its effects on children.“Children have specific developmental needs, and we want to protect them at the same time that we’re trying to push back on Big Tech,” Perry said. “It's a two-part effort. You have to really put your arm around the kids while you’re pushing Big Tech away.”",2023/03/25,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846248,"NHL teams balance progress, draft lottery as Bedard in play","LOS ANGELES (AP) — Columbus Blue Jackets general manager Jarmo Kekalainen knows if the season ended today, his team could have the best odds to land who many consider the next generational talent in the NHL.He is also keenly aware that the odds remain higher not to win the NHL’s draft lottery — and the chance to select Connor Bedard on May 8.“Look, there’s a 25.5% chance for the team to finish last, but it’s still a 74.5% chance that you don’t get it. That’s much greater than 25.5,” Kekalainen said recently. “But we’ll see where it takes us. Wherever we end up in the standings, we get the odds the league gave, and then we hope for the best of luck.”While the race for the league’s top record was done by midseason thanks to the Boston Bruins' potential record-setting run, the chase for the worst mark remains up for grabs in the final three weeks.After Friday's games Columbus and San Jose are tied for “first” at 53 points, followed by Chicago (54) and Anaheim (56). The odds for the team with the second-worst record to land the top pick is 13.5% while the third-worst record drops to 11.5%,Even though half of the league’s 32 teams do not make the playoffs, only 11 are eligible for the lottery. The rules instituted in 2022 state a team can move up a maximum of 10 spots.For the last two years, the team with the worst record has won the lottery, but that often isn’t the case. In 2012, the Blue Jackets had the worst record and lost the top pick to Edmonton.The last thing any of the coaches at the bottom want to hear, though, is lottery odds — especially if you’re Dallas Eakins, who is in the final year of his contract with the Ducks.“We want to have development and progress every night,” said Eakins, who is in his fourth season with Anaheim. “We’re not the Boston Bruins right now. That’s why we have to play a perfect game to be in the game. I don’t understand the lottery, to be honest with you. Finishing at the very bottom guarantees you nothing. I’ve seen teams lose the lottery and end up with the best player in the draft.”San Jose coach David Quinn agreed with Eakins’ assessment. And he knows firsthand about the lottery as an NHL and college coach.Quinn was with the Rangers when they benefitted in 2020. He also coached Jack Eichel at Boston University when Eichel was the second choice in the 2015 draft by Buffalo — after Edmonton won the lottery and selected Connor McDavid.“When you’re in the situation that Edmonton and Buffalo were in back then and we are in right now, people are paying attention for various reasons,” he said. “Back then, it was Eichel and McDavid. It was pretty clear McDavid would be the No. 1 pick, but Jack Eichel was going to get a hell of a consolation prize.”No one expected the Blue Jackets to have the league’s worst record after they made one of the biggest splashes in free agency last year by signing Johnny Gaudreau. But having one of the highest injury rates has reduced them to using most of the season to assess their future.Columbus, which already has 454 man-games lost to injury, suffered another blow this week when forward Patrik Laine strained a triceps muscle in practice. The Blue Jackets are also missing goaltender Elvis Merzlikins, who is in Latvia to be with his family after his grandmother fell gravely ill.“If you have 13 guys on injured reserve as we did at one point, it’s hard to expect to win,” Kekalainen said.Besides measuring their performance during games, Kekalainen and his staff have kept a keen eye on practices to ensure everyone follows the right approach.“We’ve got some bright young kids here within our group, and they can see a good future in front of them,"" he said. ""But for the team here, it’s about being professional every day and going on just like you would if you were getting ready for the playoffs. Nobody’s going to take it easy on you.”While Columbus made some minor moves near the trade deadline, Chicago and San Jose went into liquidation mode to improve their lottery chances. The Blackhawks sent Patrick Kane to the Rangers, while the Sharks traded Timo Meier to New Jersey.“It’s unfortunate, but I understand it,” Sharks defenseman Erik Karlsson said after the Meier trade. “I’ve been around the game long enough to understand what needs to be done from an organizational perspective. It just sucks that I happen to be where I’m at at this stage of my career.”Chicago coach Luke Richardson also hopes people realize that teams can build a foundation and be in the mix to draft a generational talent.“I trust the organization and scouting staff with how they approach things,” he said. “I love the energy of our team. What we’re trying to do is starting to show, but we have a long way to go.”Arizona was near the bottom three spots for most of the season, but a 6-1-3 run in the last 10 games has it at 66 points and tied for the sixth-fewest points in the league.Coyotes GM Bill Armstrong is OK with his franchise's chances of landing a top-three pick taking a significant hit.“As a GM, you never want to take the fight from your team. And so you’ve got to continue that and enjoy what you’re going through and how hard your team is fighting,” he said. “I’ve been through so many drafts that you can’t control where you draft, but you can’t control who you pick, and that’s what you got to worry about. So at the end of the day, no matter where we lie, we’ve got to be good at picking.”___AP Sports Writers Josh Dubow in San Jose, California, Jordan Cohen in Chicago and John Marshall in Phoenix contributed to this report.___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/25,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846249,17-year-old charged in kidnapping ending in Houston shooting,"A 17-year-old has been charged with kidnapping two migrants whose rescue this week from a Houston hotel by FBI agents after days of captivity ended in gunfire that killed another suspect.Josiah Jackson was charged Friday with two counts of aggravated kidnapping in the abduction of a man and woman and the attempt to ransom them, Harris County court records show. The case filings do not list an attorney for Jackson, who is being held in a county jail ahead of a bond hearing.The migrants were stopped on a highway northwest of Houston on Saturday and were forced into another vehicle by the kidnappers, according to a prosecutor. Officials have said little about what happened between then and Thursday morning, when the FBI says its agents rescued two migrants following the shooting in north Houston.The FBI and various local law enforcement agencies offered little additional information Friday and the terse court records didn't reveal much more.Senior Deputy Thomas Gilliland, a spokesman for the Harris County Sheriff’s Office, said the suspected kidnappers fled as agents moved in. Gilliland said that “within a few minutes” deputies with a dog tracked down one of the suspects, who he declined to name, took him back to the scene and turned him over to the FBI. Jackson and “his deceased co-actor held two people for ransom, requiring (sheriff's deputies) and the FBI to raid the location and rescue” them, prosecutors wrote in request that bail be set at $100,000. A prosecutor had previously said three migrants were kidnapped, but authorities have not said what happened to the possible third victim.A person familiar with the matter previously told The Associated Press that the kidnappers demanded money from the family of at least one of the migrants and were paid, but then they asked for more. The person, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the case publicly, also said the kidnappers at one point sent the family a video showing them beating a man.On the other side of Texas, two migrants were found dead Friday and at least 10 were hospitalized after police received a call that they were “suffocating” in a freight train car traveling near the U.S.-Mexico border.The Uvalde Police Department said Border Patrol was informed of the phone call and able to stop the train. About 15 migrants were found inside, according to a statement from the department. The condition of all of those hospitalized was not immediately known. University Health in San Antonio tweeted that it had received two male patients, one in critical condition and one in serious condition.___Bleiberg reported from Dallas.",2023/03/25,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846250,Mbappé delivers for France as captain; Lukaku nets hat trick,"Kylian Mbappé delivered for France again, this time wearing the captain’s armband.Leading a new era for Les Bleus, there was something very familiar about the way Mbappé slotted home two unforgiving finishes to headline a 4-0 win over the Netherlands in European Championship qualifying on Friday.France showed no lasting effects from that painful penalty-shootout loss to Argentina in the World Cup final three months ago. Nor did Mbappé, the scorer of a hat trick in a losing cause that day.One of his first touches against the Dutch was to slip a pass inside for Antoine Griezmann, his hair dyed pink, to finish first time for the opening goal inside two minutes at the Stade de France. The two stars embraced, showing there was no lingering feud after Griezmann — the more experienced of the pair — was overlooked for the captaincy in favor of Mbappé following Hugo Lloris’ retirement.Dayot Upamecano bundled in the second in the eighth minute, and the third goal in a dazzling opening 20 minutes by France was scored by Mbappé. He ran in behind the Netherlands defense and shot inside the near post after Randal Kolo Muani let a pass from Aurélien Tchouaméni roll past him.Mbappé completed the thrashing in the 88th with a solo goal, picking up the ball 40 meters out and producing a series of feints on the edge of the area before blasting a low shot beyond goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen.It took the Paris Saint-Germain striker onto 38 international goals, above Karim Benzema into fifth place on France’s all-time list. While Benzema’s time might be up for the national team, Mbappé — aged 24 and the leader of the new wave of soccer superstars after Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo — is really only getting started.Speaking of starts, this was a disappointing way for Netherlands coach Ronald Koeman to begin his second spell in charge of the team. Robbed of key midfielder Frenkie de Jong because of injury and five players during the week because of a flu virus, the Dutch were swarmed all over in a one-sided Group B game as qualifying for Euro 2024 continued.Their misery was complete when Memphis Depay had a penalty saved by France goalkeeper Mike Maignan with virtually the last kick of the match.“It was a complete performance,"" said Kolo Muani, who started up front instead of Olivier Giroud. “We made a very good start, that’s what we’d wanted to do, and afterward we were able to control the match.”LUKAKU HAT TRICKRomelu Lukaku underlined his enduring value to Belgium by scoring all three goals in a 3-0 win at Sweden in the other notable victory on Friday.It was a successful start to Domenico Tedesco's tenure as coach of Belgium, which is also playing under a new captain in Kevin De Bruyne.Tedesco will know the importance of having Lukaku healthy if the Red Devils are to finally win an international trophy.The striker wasn't fully fit at the World Cup and that was a big reason why Belgium went out in the group stage. Lukaku has been playing regularly for Inter Milan since then and was a constant threat against Sweden as he scored in the 35th, 49th and 83rd minutes, with two set up by winger Dodi Lukebakio.“A really good result,"" Tedesco said. “I felt a good spirit not only on the pitch but also on the bench. The spirit of being united.”Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Sweden's 41-year-old striker, came off the bench for his first national team appearance in nearly a year and had a couple of chances to score.LOSS FOR LEWANDOWSKIEuro 2024 could be the last major international tournament for 34-year-old Barcelona striker Robert Lewandowski, though Poland's bid to make it to Germany got off to a sticky start.Poland lost 3-1 at the Czech Republic, which went ahead when Ladislav Krejčí scored after 27 seconds — the earliest goal netted by the national team in its history.Tomáš Čvančara and Jan Kuchta also were on target for the Czechs as Lewandowski was kept scoreless in the Group E game.Austria beat Azerbaijan 4-1 in the group containing Belgium and Sweden, with on-loan Manchester United midfielder Marcel Sabitzer scoring twice, and Greece won at Gibraltar 3-0 in France's group.There were wins for Serbia (2-0 at home to Lithuania) and Montenegro (1-0 at Bulgaria) in Group G.___Steve Douglas is at https://twitter.com/sdouglas80___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/25,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846251,"Jet pitched wildly, killing 1, amid cockpit warnings: NTSB","HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — A business jet flying over New England violently pitched upward then downward, fatally injuring a passenger, after pilots responding to automated cockpit warnings switched off a system that helps keep the aircraft stable, U.S. transportation investigators reported Friday.The National Transportation Safety Board didn't reach any conclusions in its preliminary report on the main cause of the deadly March 3 accident, but it described a series of things that went wrong before and after the plane swooped out of control.Confronted with several alerts in the cockpit of the Bombardier jet, pilots followed a checklist and turned off a switch that “trims” or adjusts the stabilizer on the plane’s tail, the report said.The plane's nose then swept upward, subjecting the people inside to forces about four times the force of gravity, then pointed lower before again turning upward before pilots could regain control, the report said.Pilots told investigators they did not encounter turbulence, as the NTSB had said in an initial assessment the day after the incident.The trim system of the Bombardier Challenger 300 twin-engine jet was the subject of a Federal Aviation Administration mandate last year that pilots conduct extra safety checks before flights.Bombardier did not respond directly to the report's contents, saying in a statement that it was “carefully studying” it. In a previous statement, the Canadian manufacturer said it stood behind its Challenger 300 jets and their airworthiness.“We will continue to fully support and provide assistance to all authorities as needed,” the company said Friday.The two pilots and three passengers were traveling from Keene, New Hampshire, to Leesburg, Virginia, before diverting to Bradley International Airport in Connecticut. One passenger, Dana Hyde, 55, of Cabin John, Maryland, was brought to a hospital where she died from blunt-force injuries.Hyde served in government positions during the Clinton and Obama administrations and was counsel for the 9/11 Commission, formally known as the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States.It was unclear if Hyde was belted in her seat or up and about, in the cabin of the jet owned by Conexon, based in Kansas City, Missouri. Her husband and their son, along with the pilot and co-pilot, were not injured in the incident, the report said.A representative of Conexon, a company specializing in rural internet, declined to comment Friday.The report indicated the pilots aborted their initial takeoff because no one removed a plastic cover from one of the exterior tubes that determine airspeed, and they took off with a rudder limiter fault alert on.Another warning indicated autopilot stabilizer trim failure. The plane abruptly pitched upward as the pilots moved the stabilizer trim switch from primary to off while working through procedures on a checklist, the report said.The plane violently oscillated up and down and the ""stick pusher” activated, the report said, meaning the onboard computer thought the plane was in danger of an aerodynamic stall.John Cox, a former airline pilot and now a safety consultant, said “there are definitely issues” with the pilots’ pre-flight actions, but he said they reacted correctly when they followed the checklist for responding to trim failure.The flight crew was comprised of two experienced pilots with 5,000 and 8,000 hours of flying time, and held ratings needed to fly for an airline. But both were relatively new to the model of aircraft, earning their ratings last October.The FAA issued its directive about Bombardier Challenger 300 jets last year after multiple instances in which the horizontal stabilizer on the aircrafts caused the nose of the plane to turn down after the pilot tried to make the aircraft climb.___Sharp reported from Portland, Maine.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846252,Lack of March Madness: Seeds hold form in Seattle 3 Region,"SEATTLE (AP) — Reaching the Sweet 16 is old hat for Geno Auriemma and UConn. They've done it in a record 29 consecutive NCAA Tournaments.Because of all the Huskies have gone through this season with injuries and illnesses to both players and coaches, this one was more special for the Hall of Fame coach.“Everything was a struggle. Everything was hard,” Auriemma said. “And for us to be in the position that we’re in -- to go to the same place where so many other UConn teams have gone, yet having gone through so much more than I think any other UConn team has had to go through — I was really proud of them. Because I’ve been through a lot of these, but they haven’t.”The Huskies will play Ohio State in the first semifinal Saturday. Tennessee will face Virginia Tech, which is making its first appearance in the second weekend of the tournament since 1999, in the second game.The two winners will play Monday night with a trip to the Final Four in Dallas on the line. UConn is trying to extend its record streak of 14 consecutive Final Four appearances.Unlike the other Seattle Regional where only one of the top teams made it this far, all four of the higher seeds advanced in Seattle 3.While the Huskies have the longest active streak of Sweet 16 appearances, no team has reached this stage of March Madness more than Tennessee. This is the Lady Vols' 36th appearance in the regional semifinals — most for any men's or women's program.No team has played better than the Lady Vols in the opening two rounds as they won each of their first two games by 45 points. The only other school to do that is UConn, which did it three times. The Huskies went on to win the national championship twice in those years.The Lady Vols were predicted to be good this season and after early season struggles they have played much better lately.“The growth throughout the season has been positive, we learned how to play better together,” Tennessee coach Kellie Harper said. “Our defense has improved, our rebounding has improved throughout the season.”FACING A FAMILIAR FOEUConn senior Dorka Juhasz will be facing her old team in Ohio State, which she graduated from two years ago. Juhasz flourished in her time with the Buckeyes earning all conference honors twice, but wanted a new challenge and a team that could compete for national championships, so she joined the Huskies last year.“I would say I’m excited. I think it’s just -- you know, I remember just seeing, first of all, like, the bracket coming out and, like, Ohio State popped up and everybody was like, ooh, like, there’s a possibility playing Ohio State. There’s no negative feelings about that. I still have a lot of friends and I always have a lot of respect for my old coaching staff and everybody that helped me there because at the end of the day, I wouldn’t be here without them.”The feeling is mutual with Ohio State coach Kevin McGuff.“She went to a great program and we continued to get better and I think both people are in a better place,” he said. “I enjoyed coaching her she did a great job for us. This was good opportunity for her to get into one more program. This has been a really good two years for her. She's strengthened her position on being a good pro.”JOINING AN EXCLUSIVE CLUBVirginia Tech coach Kenny Brooks is the lone Black male coach to reach the Sweet 16 this season, becoming the second ever to accomplish that since the tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1994. Syracuse's Quentin Hillsman was the other reaching the Final Four in 2016.The significance isn’t lost on the Hokies’ leader.“Everything I am doing, I'm doing for myself, my program, for our university,” Brooks said. “I do it for people who look like me. There are a lot of great male Black coaches who deserve an opportunity. If they can see what I’ve done and it inspires them to give another Black male an opportunity. then I've done my job.”Two other Black male coaches did reach the regional semifinals when the field was smaller with Earnest Riggins doing it in 1985 at San Diego State and Winthrop McGriff accomplishing the feat at Cheyney State after he took over for C. Vivian Stringer. McGriff led that team to the Final Four.Brooks is one of four Black coaches overall to reach the regional semifinals, the most in over a decade.It has been a record-setting year for the Hokies. They won the ACC championship and reached the Sweet 16, two goals the team had at the start of the season. They've won 29 games to break the school record for most in a season that was set by the 1998-99 squad that was the last to go this far.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/25,,World

And events like drag story hours, where drag queens read books to children, have drawn protesters.Spectrum WT — a group for LGBT+ students and allies — had organized the March 31 drag show to raise money for the Trevor Project, a group that works to prevent suicide among LGBTQ young people. Spectrum WT has said that drag isn’t designed to be offensive, adding that it’s a celebration of many things, including “queerness, gender, acceptance, love and especially femininity.”The lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Amarillo calls the cancellation “textbook viewpoint discrimination,” saying that Wendler “cannot bar Spectrum WT and its members from exercising their First Amendment rights merely because he believes his personal opinions override the Constitution.”In Wendler's writing explaining his decision, he said he “will not appear to condone the diminishment of any group at the expense of impertinent gestures toward another group for any reason, even when the law of the land appears to require it.”The cancellation has spurred protests on campus, with students waving gay pride flags and holding signs that included the saying “Women for Drag."" But other students have said they agreed with the Wendler's stance.Spectrum WT and its two student leaders who filed the lawsuit are represented by the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, or FIRE, a national civil liberties group.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846266,Book thief in plot that duped famous authors avoids prison,"NEW YORK (AP) — It was the stuff of novels: For years, a con artist plagued the publishing industry, impersonating editors and agents to pull off hundreds of literary heists. But the manuscripts obtained from high-profile authors were never resold or leaked, rendering the thefts all the more perplexing.The Thursday sentencing of Filippo Bernardini in Manhattan federal court brought the saga to an end and, with it, finally some answers. After pleading guilty to one count of wire fraud in January, Bernardini was sentenced to time served, avoiding prison on a felony charge that carried up to 20 years in prison. Prosecutors had asked for a sentence of at least a year.Bernardini, now 30, impersonated hundreds of people over the course of the scheme that began around August 2016 and obtained more than a thousand manuscripts, including from high-profile authors like Margaret Atwood and Ethan Hawke, authorities have said.In an emotional, four-page letter to Judge Colleen McMahon submitted earlier this month, Bernardini apologized for what he characterized as his “egregious, stupid and wrong” actions. He also offered insight into his motivations, which had long stymied victims and observers alike even after his plea.He described a deep love of books that stemmed from childhood and led him to pursue a publishing career in London. While he obtained an internship at a literary agency there, he wrote, he had trouble securing a full-time job in the industry afterward.“While employed, I saw manuscripts being shared between editors, agents, and literary scouts or even with individuals outside the industry. So, I wondered: why can I not also get to read these manuscripts?” he recounted.He spoofed an email address of someone he knew and mimicked his former colleagues' tone to ask for a manuscript that had yet to be published. The success of that deception turned his quest for ill-gotten books into “an obsession, a compulsive behaviour.”“I had a burning desire to feel like I was still one of these publishing professionals and read these new books,” he wrote.“Every time an author sent me the manuscript I would feel like I was still part of the industry. At the time, I did not think about the harm I was causing,” he added. “I never wanted to and I never leaked these manuscripts. I wanted to keep them closely to my chest and be one of the fewest to cherish them before anyone else, before they ended up in bookshops.”As part of a bid to avoid prison, Bernardini's lawyers also submitted more than a dozen letters to the judge from his friends and family. In a novelistic twist of sorts, among them was a letter from a victim — writer Jesse Ball, the author of “Samedi the Deafness,” “Curfew” and “The Divers' Game.”Bernardini impersonated Ball's editor to convince the writer to send several unpublished manuscripts, Ball said in his letter pushing for leniency. Decrying the state of the industry as “more and more corporate and cookiecutter” and referring to the crime as a “caper” and a “trivial thing, frivolous thing,” Ball argued that “we must be grateful when something human enters the picture: when the publishing industry for once becomes something worth writing about.""“For once a person cared deeply about something—what matter that he was an interloper? You cannot imagine the soul crushing boredom of run-of-the-mill publishing correspondence,” Ball wrote, adding that he suffered no harm from the thefts other than some confusion. “I’m grateful that there is still room in the world for something facetious to occur now and then.”In weighing arguments from the prosecution and defense, McMahon pushed back on the idea that the crime was victimless, with New York magazine's Vulture — the publication that brought the mystery to public attention with a 2021 story called “The Spine Collector” — reporting that “she was especially moved by a letter from a literary scout"" who had been accused of Bernardini's crimes. Vulture also reported that McMahon expressed sympathy for Bernardini in light of a new autism diagnosis, but said it didn't excuse the threats he made in some correspondence. But she concluded a prison sentence wouldn't help the victims.Bernardini — an Italian citizen and British resident who was arrested at John F. Kennedy International Airport in January 2022 — will be deported from the U.S. Court documents show he asked to be deported to the United Kingdom, where he lives with his partner and dog, with Italy as the designated alternative.As part of his guilty plea, Bernardini agreed to pay $88,000 in restitution, which court documents show will go to Penguin Random House.“The cruel irony is that every time I open a book,"" Bernardini wrote of his one-time passion, “it reminds me of my wrongdoings and what they led me to.”",2023/03/25,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846267,"Georgia activist killed by troopers shot first, officers say","ATLANTA (AP) — Georgia authorities allege that state troopers in January fatally shot an environmental protester who had fired at authorities after a trooper shot pepper balls into the protester’s tent, according to incident reports obtained Friday by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.The newspaper obtained multiple Georgia Department of Public Safety use-of-force incident reports through an open records request. The records offer the most complete account yet of authorities’ version of the Jan. 18 killing of Manuel Paez Terán, who went by the name Tortuguita and used the pronoun they.Paez Terán was killed in DeKalb County's South River Forest as officers tried to clear activists who were camping near the site of a planned police and training center that protesters derisively call “Cop City.”Protesters have questioned officials' assertion that officers shot Paez Terán in self-defense after the 26-year-old shot a trooper. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation continues to examine the shooting and has released few details about the incident, other than to say that preliminary evidence supports authorities' assertions and that the trooper was shot with a bullet from a gun Paez Terán legally purchased in 2020.According to the newly obtained incident reports, Paez Terán briefly spoke to officers who came to the protester’s tent and refused their demands to leave the area, prompting authorities to fire pepper balls. Authorities say Paez Terán then fired multiple shots from inside the tent, and six officers returned fire, shooting the activist more than a dozen times.“I knew the suspect in the tent was shooting at us because I could hear the gun shots coming from inside of the tent,"" according to a report written by a Georgia Department of Public Safety corporal. “I could see the front of the tent door flapping as the bullets ripped through it and I could hear bullets striking the vegetation surrounding me.”The corporal said authorities had encountered Paez Terán inside the tent, and at one point the activist told the officers: “No, I want you to leave.""The corporal said Paez Terán was “very confident” in asking authorities to leave and “it was immediately apparent” that the protester had “no intentions of cooperating.""The corporal also wrote that, prior to the gunfire, he told Paez Terán that officers were about to fire chemical agents into the tent and that Paez Terán would be charged with criminal trespassing.Paez Terán’s death and their dedication to opposing the training center has vaulted the “Stop Cop City” movement onto the national and international stage, with leftist activists from across the country holding vigils and prompting some to travel and join the protest movement that began in 2021. They say officers at the 85-acre (34-hectare) center would be trained to become more militarized and quell dissent, all while hundreds of trees are cut down, damaging the climate and flood mitigation in a poor, majority-Black neighborhood.A few protests have turned violent, including earlier this month when more than 150 masked activists left a nearby music festival and stormed the proposed site of the training center, setting fire to construction equipment and throwing rocks at retreating law enforcement officers.The Atlanta City Council approved building the proposed $90 million Atlanta Public Safety Training Center in 2021, saying a state-of-the-art campus would replace substandard offerings and boost police morale, which is beset by hiring and retention struggles in the wake of violent protests against racial injustice that roiled the city after George Floyd was killed by police in 2020.For more than two months, Paez Terán’s family and their attorneys have called on officials to release information about the shooting. According to an autopsy the family commissioned, Paez Terán was sitting cross-legged with their hands in the air at the time they were shot. The autopsy report also notes it is “impossible to determine” whether the activist was holding a firearm at the time they were shot.The family commissioned the autopsy after the DeKalb County Medical Examiner’s Office conducted the initial examination. Officials have not released the DeKalb County report, so it’s unclear whether it reached a similar conclusion that Paez Terán had their hands raised with palms facing inward at the time of the shooting.The family’s attorneys did not immediately return a request for comment.",2023/03/25,,World

He was 1 down with five holes to play when Spaun ran off four straight birdies for a 2-and-1 win. He is the No. 61 seed, the lowest to advance.“My caddie said, ‘Let’s birdie every hole starting on 14.' That's kind of ... well, that's exactly what we did,” said Spaun, whose next match is against Schauffele.Some players had an extremely short day when their opponents withdrew. Hideki Matsuyama was on the range for about 20 minutes when neck soreness forced him to concede. That sent Max Homa through to the weekend.“It's nice for me — bogey-free round,” Homa said. “Would have rather played, but I'll take it as a quasi-win.”The highest seed headed home was Jon Rahm. Even with a loss on Wednesday, he still had control of getting to the weekend if he beat Billy Horschel. Instead, Rahm took double bogey on the second hole and trailed the rest of the way.The match got away from him when Rahm hit into the water on the par-3 11th to fall 4 down. He was in good shape to win the 12th until he set his wedge behind the ball in the rough to the right of the green, and the ball slightly rolled out of a divot. That was a one-shot penalty, he halved the hole with a par and then he missed a birdie chance on the next.Horschel, who won the Match Play two years ago, beat him in 14 holes.Cantlay, who lost in a playoff to Brian Harman two years ago, beat him with a short birdie putt on the 17th hole to advance for the first time in Match Play. Another newcomer to the weekend was Schauffele, who rallied to beat Tom Hoge.Mackenzie Hughes and and Kurt Kitayama were the only players to lose matches on Wednesday and make it to the weekend. It wasn't easy for either of them.Hughes throttled Taylor Montgomery, 6 and 4, and then had to wait about two hours to face him in a sudden-death playoff. On the first hole, Montgomery hit a chunk pop-up into the trees, sailed the green and Hughes won with a 5-foot birdie.Kitayama was in a three-way playoff with Tony Finau, whom he beat 4 and 3, and Adrian Meronk of Poland. Finau was eliminated on the first playoff hole. Kitayama won on the next one with a 20-foot birdie putt.Other group winners: Jason Day, Sam Burns, Lucas Herbert and Cameron Young, who has 19 birdies and two eagles in 48 holes this week.Kuchar is 44, the oldest player in the field, and he is leaning big on his experience. He won in 2013, lost in the championship match in 2019 and two other times reached the semifinals.The first match he won was in 2010, against Anthony Kim.Kuchar wouldn't have been in the 64-man field if not for nine players being ineligible for signing with Saudi-funded LIV Golf. He wasn't ever aware he was in range of Woods' record until he won his first match Wednesday.He had a chance to tie Woods on Thursday until missing a 5-foot putt and halving his match, and he said the record crossed his mind that night.“The point of this tournament is to keep winning matches, and I wanted to win this match to be able to move on to the 16s,” Kuchar said. “So that was the main focus. Certainly getting a chance to tie any record of Tiger’s is an amazing thing.”Along with being solid in match play, Kuchar's needle is among the sharpest on tour. He said he has yet to send Woods a text about tying his record.“Maybe tomorrow,” he said.___AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/25,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846272,California jailbreak mastermind sentenced for daring escape,"SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) — A man serving a life sentence for kidnapping and mutilating a marijuana dispensary owner was given an additional sentence Friday for masterminding a daring, elaborate escape from a Southern California jail.Hossein Nayeri, 44, was sentenced to the maximum of two years and eight months in state prison for the Jan. 22, 2016, escape from the Orange County Men's Central Jail in Santa Ana and for stealing a van while on the run.Nayeri and two other men used smuggled tools to cut through the half-inch bars on a metal grate in their maximum-security dorm cell, then climbed through plumbing shafts within the walls to reach the roof, where they rappelled down five stories using a rope made of bed linens, according to authorities and a cellphone video shot by Nayeri.The men then kidnapped a 72-year-old unlicensed tax driver at gunpoint and forced him to drive them away at gunpoint, prosecutors said.Over five days, the man drove the fugitives around as they fled, stopping at various motels as they took his car and a stolen van hundreds of miles north to San Jose, prosecutors said.One escapee, Bac Tien Duong, later feared that the driver would be killed and fled with him back to Southern California, authorities said.Nayeri and Jonathan Tieu were arrested the next day in San Francisco after a man recognized them from media reports, prosecutors said.The taxi driver testified at Nayeri's trial and credited Duong with saving his life. Nayeri was convicted last week of the jailbreak and stealing the van but acquitted of kidnapping, a charge that carried a potential life sentence.Duong was convicted of escape and kidnapping in 2021 and sentenced to 20 years in prison. Tieu is awaiting trial for the escape, prosecutors said.At the time of his jailbreak, Nayeri was awaiting trial on charges that he and two friends kidnapped, tortured and mutilated a marijuana dispensary owner in 2012. The owner and a woman acquaintance were kidnapped from a Newport Beach home because the robbers falsely believed he had buried $1 million in the Mojave Desert, prosecutors said.He was beaten with rubber piping, shocked with a Taser, burned with a blowtorch and finally his penis was cut off before the robbers fled, prosecutors said. The money was never found.Nayeri fled to Iran. But he was later caught in the Czech Republic and extradited. In 2020, he was given two life sentences without the possibility of parole for kidnapping and a consecutive seven-year term for torture.Nayeri’s co-defendants also were convicted.",2023/03/25,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846273,K-State's Keyontae Johnson thriving 2 years after collapse,"NEW YORK (AP) — Florida Atlantic coach Dusty May had a hard time keeping his emotions in check as he spoke about Kansas State forward Keyontae Johnson.May's near-tears had nothing to do with preparing his Owls (34-3) to face Johnson and the Wildcats (26-9) in the East Region final on Saturday night at Madison Square Garden with a trip to the Final Four on the line.Johnson is a special person to May and his family.As an assistant coach at Florida, May recruited Johnson, met his family and played a major part in getting him to join the Gators. May ended up leaving for the FAU job for the 2018-19 season.Two year later, Johnson's life changed. During a game against Florida State on Dec. 12, 2020, he collapsed and was rushed to a hospital, where he spent three days in a medically induced coma. He sat out the rest of that season and all of the next, then transferred to Kansas State, where he began playing again this fall and became one of the most important players on a team that reached the Elite Eight of the NCAA Tournament.The third-seeded Wildcats got there with a 98-93 overtime victory over Michigan State on Thursday night, with Johnson scoring 22 points and getting the go-ahead basket on a reverse dunk after taking an alley-oop pass from Markquis Nowell.During the game, May said Johnson had noticed his family among the 19,624 fans in the crowd and smiled at them.“I said, ‘Why wouldn’t he be cherishing every moment with what he’s been through!’” May said. “To come back and play this game on this stage, there’s no other way but embracing and enjoying every single moment. And he’s obviously doing that.”Johnson said he spoke with at least three doctors when he considered returning to basketball. Two of them said he could play.""So I just went with what the two doctors said and trusted in God and trusted my faith just with everything,"" he said Friday after practice. “Just my circle kept me positive and just kept me in an uplifted mood, and it just got me through a lot.”On the court, Johnson — who's averaging team-highs of 17.7 points and 6.9 rebounds — seems to be having a blast.“I just always try to keep a positive energy around me, always let the guys see I’m happy,” Johnson said. ""I can’t be blessed enough to be here, so just trying to enjoy life, enjoy the moment.""Johnson still had some concerns about his health when he started practicing again last summer. But as he ramped up his work, his stress levels eased and his trust in his doctors grew.The one person worried at that point was first-year Kansas State coach Jerome Tang, who said Johnson had promised an answer about whether he planned join the Wildcats before the staff took a summer break.Johnson then took a late visit to Nebraska and didn't decide to attend the school in Manhattan, Kansas, until just before the start of the year.Johnson said his return serves as motivation for people looking to overcome adversity.“I don’t really think about it, I just go out there and play,” Johnson said. “Everything happens for a reason, but I’ve just got my faith in God and I know he’s going to lead the way and not fail me.”Johnson could apply for a medical redshirt that would give him another season at Kansas State, but he could also choose to go to the NBA.“Basketball was almost taken away from me,” he said, “so I go out there to have fun and show my teammates the love and joy that I have for them.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/25,,World

(AP) — It was back to business as usual for Shohei Ohtani on Friday.The two-way star returned to Los Angeles Angels camp after his MVP performance in the World Baseball Classic. Three days after striking out Mike Trout to clinch the WBC title for Japan against the United States in Miami, Ohtani was on the back fields in Tempe, pitching in a minor league game against some Arizona Diamondbacks farmhands.Friday’s outing was to keep Ohtani on schedule for his opening day start next Thursday in Oakland. He faced 19 batters while working into a fifth inning, walking one and striking out eight. He allowed four hits, including a home run to Gavin Conticello, an eighth-round draft pick for Arizona in 2021.Druw Jones, the Diamondbacks’ first-round pick last season and the son of 10-time Gold Glove center fielder Andruw Jones, hit a single off Ohtani.“The game today was to get up to my pitch count, get used to the pitch clock again and using the PitchCom,” Ohtani said through an interpreter after throwing 78 pitches. “All is well on my end.”“I felt like with all the pitches and all the intensity of the Classic, I was already ready for opening day. Today was just fine-tuning stuff, getting used (to the new rules),"" he said.Ohtani only made one start for the Angels before leaving for Japan, for whom he pitched 9 2-3 innings with a 1.86 ERA in three WBC appearances. The last outing was Tuesday’s ninth-inning appearance against the United States, where he fanned Trout on a full-count slider to set off a celebration.The party was short-lived though, as Ohtani returned to his MLB team on Wednesday so he could begin preparing for the regular season — after which the 28-year-old will be a free agent. He was runner-up in the American League MVP voting after hitting 34 homers and driving in 95 runs for the Angels last season, plus posting a 2.33 ERA in 28 starts with a 15-9 record.He didn’t bat Friday, but Angels manager Phil Nevin said Ohtani will be the Angels’ DH for the three games in the Freeway Series in Los Angeles against Dodgers beginning Sunday that will conclude the exhibition season. Trout, who did not return to Arizona after the WBC, will meet the Angels there.Tuesday’s relief appearance was on a day he was scheduled for a between-starts side session in the bullpen. It just happened to come on the big stage.Nevin said he watched his two superstars go head to head “just like any other fan."" He was ready to see Ohtani close.“I wasn’t worried about him at all,” Nevin said. “We had that planned all along. I just wasn’t able to relay that to you guys yet. We knew that was a possibility. I trust him and I trust that he knows his body as well as anybody.”As for Ohtani, the excitement was something he hadn’t felt in a long time, as the Angels have not been contenders despite the efforts of Ohtani and Trout.“First time pitching in a playoff atmosphere like that since my days in Japan,” Ohtani said. “I’ve never experienced a World Series, but I guess it would be something similar.”Nevin said he would be tempted to use Ohtani in relief in the same way if the Angels were able to get into the postseason.“I got a lot of texts ... who am I rooting for, how am I feeling,” the manager said. “I can tell you exactly what I was feeling. I was feeling that this is the greatest game in the world. There’s no other sport, no other situation that can create that kind of drama and atmosphere, one on one, the two best players in the world. It’s what makes our game great.”___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/25,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846276,'There's nothing left': Deep South tornadoes kill 26,"ROLLING FORK, Miss. (AP) — Rescuers raced Saturday to search for survivors and help hundreds of people left homeless after a powerful tornado cut a devastating path through Mississippi, killing at least 25 people, injuring dozens, and flattening entire blocks as it carved a path of destruction for more than an hour. One person was killed in Alabama.The tornado devastated a swath of the Mississippi Delta town of Rolling Fork, reducing homes to piles of rubble, flipping cars on their sides and toppling the town's water tower. Residents hunkered down in bath tubs and hallways during Friday night's storm and later broke into a John Deere store that they converted into a triage center for the wounded.“There’s nothing left,” said Wonder Bolden, holding her granddaughter, Journey, while standing outside the remnants of her mother’s now-leveled mobile home in Rolling Fork. “There’s just the breeze that’s running, going through -- just nothing.”Based on early data, the tornado received a preliminary EF-4 rating, the National Weather Service office in Jackson said late Saturday in a tweet. An EF-4 tornado has top wind gusts between 166 mph and 200 mph (265 kph and 320 kph), according to the service. The Jackson office cautioned it was still gathering information on the tornado.The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency announced late Saturday afternoon in a tweet that the death toll had risen to 25 and that dozens of people were injured. Four people previously reported missing had been found.Other parts of the Deep South were digging out from damage caused by other suspected twisters. One man died in Morgan County, Alabama, the sheriff's department there said in a tweet.Throughout Saturday, survivors walked around dazed and in shock as they broke through debris and fallen trees with chain saws, searching for survivors. Power lines were pinned under decades-old oaks, their roots torn from the ground.Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves issued a State of Emergency and vowed to help rebuild as he headed to view the damage in an area speckled with wide expanses of cotton, corn and soybean fields and catfish farming ponds. President Joe Biden also promised federal help, describing the damage as “heartbreaking.”The damage in Rolling Fork was so widespread that several storm chasers — who follow severe weather and often put up livestreams showing dramatic funnel clouds — pleaded for search and rescue help. Others abandoned the chase to drive injured people to the hospital.It didn't help that the community hospital on the west side of town was damaged, forcing patients to be transferred. The tornado also mangled a cotton warehouse and ripped the steeple off a Baptist church.Sheddrick Bell, his partner and two daughters crouched in a closet of their Rolling Fork home for 15 minutes as the tornado barreled through. Windows broke as his daughters cried and his partner prayed.“I was just thinking, ‘If I can still open my eyes and move around, I’m good,’” he said.Rodney Porter, who lives about 20 miles (32 kilometers) south of Rolling Fork and belongs to a local fire department, said he didn't know how anyone survived as he delivered water and fuel to families there.“It’s like a bomb went off,” he said, describing houses stacked on top of houses. Crews even cut gas lines to the town to keep residents and first responders safe.The warning the National Weather Service issued as the storm hit didn’t mince words: “To protect your life, TAKE COVER NOW!”Preliminary information based on estimates from storm reports a,nd radar data indicate that the tornado was on the ground for more than an hour and traversed at least 170 miles (274 kilometers), said Lance Perrilloux, a meteorologist with the weather service’s Jackson, Mississippi, office.“That’s rare — very, very rare,” he said, attributing the long path to widespread atmospheric instability. “All the ingredients were there.""Perrilloux said preliminary findings are that the tornado began its path of destruction just southwest of Rolling Fork before continuing northeast toward the rural communities of Midnight and Silver City, then moving toward Tchula, Black Hawk and Winona.The supercell that produced the deadly twister also appeared to produce tornadoes that caused damage in northwest and north-central Alabama, said Brian Squitieri, a severe storms forecaster with the weather service's Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma.In northern Alabama’s Morgan County, a 67-year-old man who became trapped beneath a trailer that flipped over during severe overnight storms was rescued by first responders, but he died later at a hospital, AL.com reported.Even as survey teams work to assess how many tornadoes struck and their severity, the Storm Prediction Center warned of the potential for hail, wind and possibly a few tornadoes Sunday in parts of Mississippi and Louisiana.Cornel Knight waited at a relative’s home in Rolling Fork for the tornado to strike with his wife and 3-year-old daughter. Despite the darkness, its path was visible.“You could see the direction from every transformer that blew,” he said. Just a cornfield away from where he was, the twister struck another relative’s home, collapsing a wall and trapping several people.Royce Steed, the emergency manager in Humphreys County where Silver City is located, likened the damage to Hurricane Katrina in 2005.“It is almost complete devastation,” he said after crews finished searching buildings and switched to damage assessments. “This little old town, I don’t know what the population is, it is more or less wiped off the map.”In the town, the roof had torn off Noel Crook’s home.“Yesterday was yesterday and that’s gone – there’s nothing I can do about it,” Crook said. “Tomorrow is not here yet. You don’t have any control over it, so here I am today.""The tornado looked so powerful on radar as it neared the town of Amory, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) southeast of Tupelo, that one Mississippi meteorologist paused to say a prayer after new radar information came in.“Oh man,” WTVA’s Matt Laubhan said on the live broadcast. “Dear Jesus, please help them. Amen.”Now that town is boiling its water, and a curfew is in effect. Three shelters in the state are feeding the throngs of displaced people.“It’s a priceless feeling to see the gratitude on people’s faces to know they’re getting a hot meal,” said William Trueblood, of the Salvation Army, as he headed to the area, picking up supplies along the way.Despite the damage, there were signs of improvement. Power outages, which at one point were affecting more than 75,000 customers in Tennessee, Mississippi and Alabama, had been cut by a third by midafternoon Saturday, according to poweroutage.us.Meteorologists saw a big tornado risk coming for the general region as much as a week in advance, said Northern Illinois University meteorology professor Walker Ashley.Tornado experts like Ashley have been warning about increased risk exposure in the region because of people building more.“You mix a particularly socioeconomically vulnerable landscape with a fast-moving, long-track nocturnal tornado, and, disaster will happen,” Ashley said in an email.___Associated Press writer Emily Wagster Pettus in Rolling Fork, Mississippi; Michael Goldberg in Silver City, Mississippi; Jim Salter in O'Fallon, Missouri; Rick Callahan in Indianapolis; Heather Hollingsworth in Mission, Kansas; Lisa Baumann in Bellingham, Washington; Robert Jablon in Los Angeles; Seth Borenstein in Kensington, Maryland; and Jackie Quinn in Washington, D.C. contributed to this report.",2023/03/26,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846277,A look at the US military mission in Syria and its dangers,"WASHINGTON (AP) — When an Iranian drone struck a U.S. base in northeastern Syria, killing a contractor and wounding several U.S. troops, it was just the latest in a growing number of attacks on American forces in Syria. But its lethality was rare. In most recent cases, no U.S. forces have been hurt in such attacks.The strike on Thursday — by a small, suicide drone — set off a series of retaliatory bombings, and the top U.S. commander for the Middle East, Gen. Erik Kurilla, quickly warned that the U.S. was prepared to launch more attacks if needed.American troops have been in Syria since 2015, but the latest casualties highlight what has been a consistent, but often quiet, U.S. counterterrorism mission, aimed at countering Iranian-backed militias and preventing the resurgence of the Islamic State group.A look at the U.S. troop presence in Syria.IT ALL BEGAN WITH THE ISLAMIC STATE GROUPOn any given day there are at least 900 U.S. forces in Syria, along with an undisclosed number of contractors. U.S. special operations forces also move in and out of the country, but are usually in small teams and are not included in the official count.They are trying to prevent any comeback by the Islamic State group, which swept through Iraq and Syria in 2014, taking control of large swaths of territory.For years, the U.S. and its coalition allies battled IS in Iraq and Syria, partnering with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces. By 2019, the U.S. declared the Islamic State caliphate destroyed, but remnants of the group remain a threat, including about 10,000 fighters held in detention facilities in Syria and tens of thousands of their family members living in refugee camps.U.S. forces advise and assist the SDF, including in securing the detention facilities, and they also conduct counterterror missions against the Islamic State group and other al-Qaida-affiliated militants, and carry out strikes on Iran-backed militias that have attacked U.S. facilities.Russia, an ally of the Syrian government, is also active in the country, but Washington and Moscow have used a deconfliction phone line in an effort to avoid conflict there.IRAN IS ANOTHER REASON THE U.S. REMAINS IN SYRIATehran's political influence and militia strength throughout the region have created a security concern for the U.S. Since the defeat of the Islamic State group, Iran-backed fighters have expanded their influence in the region.The presence of American forces in Syria makes it more difficult for Iran to move weapons into Lebanon, for use by its proxies, including the Lebanese Hezbollah, against Israel.For example, the al-Tanf garrison in southeastern Syria is located on a vital road that can link Iranian-backed forces from Tehran all the way to southern Lebanon — and Israel’s doorstep. So troops at the U.S. garrison can disrupt what could be an uncontested land bridge for Iran to the eastern Mediterranean.The oil-rich Deir el-Zour province in eastern Syria, where some of the latest U.S. strikes hit, sits along that strategic route. Syrian government forces and allied Iran-backed groups are deployed on the west bank of the Euphrates River in Deir el-Zour, while American troops support their allies, the SDF, largely along the east bank.WHAT HAPPENED IN THE LATEST ATTACK?A small suicide — sometimes called a kamikazi — drone flew low over fencing into the base and struck a maintenance facility where U.S. troops and contractors were working. It did not fire a weapon, but exploded when it hit.One American contractor was killed, and five U.S. service members and another contractor were wounded. One service member returned to duty and the other wounded taken out of Syria for medical treatment. Contractors often are used to help with maintenance and logistical support.U.S. officials blame Iran, pointing to remnants of the drone, multiple intelligence threat streams and the fact that the attack was so similar to previous ones by the militants. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss military operations.In retaliation, U.S. F-15 fighter jets from al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar struck locations near Deir el-Zour, targeting the Iran-backed militias believed responsible for the attack. The number of reported casualties varied, and the U.S. would not confirm any numbers.In an apparent response to those U.S. airstrikes, 10 rockets were fired Friday at a U.S. base known as Green Village. No one was injured. Air Force Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary, said the rockets were fired by groups affiliated with Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps, but he stopped short of blaming Tehran for the U.S. deaths and injuries.AREN'T U.S. TROOPS PROTECTED?The U.S. maintains security at all of its bases but steadfastly declines to provide much detail. Reporters traveling in Syria, including from The Associated Press, have frequently seen a range of security measures, ranging from fencing and other barricades to more high-tech radars and other sensors.Asked about information that one of the radars at the base was not working, Ryder said there was not a total gap in radar capabilities: “There was a complete sight picture in terms of radar.""But Iranian drones represent a serious — and expanding — threat in Syria. Kurilla told Congress that Tehran is building increasingly sophisticated drones, and now has an arsenal that ranges from small, short-range systems ""to long-range one-way attack platforms.""Iran has also provided drones to Russia for use in its ongoing war in Ukraine.PREVIOUS SKIRMISHESOne of the deadliest flare-ups between the U.S. and Iran-backed groups occurred in December 2019, when U.S. military strikes in Iraq and Syria killed 25 fighters and wounded others from the Iran-backed Kataeb Hezbollah Iraqi militia. The U.S. said the strike was in retaliation for the killing of an American contractor in a rocket attack on an Iraqi military base that it blamed on the group.In August 2022, the U.S. carried out strikes targeting Iran-backed militias in Deir el-Zour province. The Pentagon said the attacks were meant to send a message to Iran, which the U.S. blamed for a number of drone attacks, including one that targeted the al-Tanf garrison. That base was also hit in January, when three suicide drones struck, wounding two Syrian opposition fighters. The U.S. again said Iran-backed groups were responsible.Israel has also struck Iranian targets in eastern Syria, although it rarely claims responsibility. In November 2022, airstrikes targeted tanker trucks that crossed from Iraq into eastern Syria. The convoy was reportedly carrying fuel and weapons to militias in Deir el-Zour. The U.S. denied involvement, and an Israeli military official later strongly suggested that Israel was behind the strike. ___Associated Press writers Bassem Mroue, Kareem Chehayeb and Abby Sewell in Beirut and Tara Copp in Washington contributed to this report.",2023/03/25,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846278,Clippers' Leonard to team: 'dial in deeper' without George,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — That sound heard this week was the Los Angeles Clippers breathing a sigh of relief that Paul George's knee injury wasn't as devastating as it first appeared.The All-Star guard suffered a sprained right knee after going down hard in the closing minutes of a one-point loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder on Tuesday.An MRI showed no major structural damage, and depending upon his condition when he's reevaluated in two to three weeks, George could be back in time for the first round of the playoffs that begin April 15.“We got the best-case scenario as far as what we thought it could be,” coach Tyronn Lue said. “His spirits are down, but that's to be expected when it's late in the season and when you want to help your team.”In the meantime, plenty of minutes are available for the taking. Eric Gordon started in George's place in a 127-105 win over the Thunder on Thursday, and he'll keep that spot while George is out. Reserve Bones Hyland led the bench with 16 points in his first action since March 3.“Nobody's head was down,” All-Star Kawhi Leonard said. “One man can't win these basketball games. We're going to have to come in with a great effort.”Leonard hit his first seven shots and finished with 32 points on 15 shots against the Thunder.“This is what we need from him every night,” Lue said of Leonard.Russell Westbrook is averaging 14.1 points, 5.2 rebounds and 7.3 assists through 13 games since leaving the Lakers last month.“He brings energy and pace to the team and plays both ends of the floor,” Leonard said. “He's been doing a good job.”The Clippers, who host New Orleans on Saturday, are currently fifth in the Western Conference with a 39-35 record with eight games remaining in the regular season.“Losing PG is tough in itself, but we just got to rally together,” Westbrook said. “I got to be more aggressive and find ways to be effective on both ends.”It's not the first time the Clippers have been without one of their two superstars.Leonard tore his right ACL in the second round against Utah in 2021. The Clippers still advanced to the conference finals for the first time in franchise history before losing in six games. He missed all last season rehabilitating after surgery.George carried the load, but not without absences. He missed three months because of a torn ligament in his elbow and he sat out the team's loss in the second play-in game after testing positive for COVID-19.“We got to keep sharing the ball and just dial in even deeper and come into these games more focused because we're missing a superstar,” Leonard said.___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/25,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846280,Gonzaga faces UConn in Elite Eight after epic win over UCLA,"LAS VEGAS (AP) — Gonzaga pulled off a March miracle against UCLA in Sweet 16, winning an epic game that featured a furious rally and two 3-pointers in the final 13 seconds.The Zags celebrated on the floor, with their families in the stands and in the locker room.Then they turned their attention to a physical UConn team playing like it's capable of winning a national championship.“It was kind of one of those things like a short memory, because March there’s no time to dwell on the past and try to live in that moment too much,” Gonzaga's Julian Strawther said Friday. “Tomorrow’s already game day. That’s what we’ve got our eyes set on.”The Zags were in this position two years ago in the NCAA Tournament. It didn't go well.Jalen Suggs had one of the most memorable March Madness moments against UCLA in the 2021 Final Four, hitting a running, buzzer-beating 3-pointer from just inside half-court to send Gonzaga to the national championship game.Two days later, the Zags got manhandled by Baylor in the title game.Gonzaga stunned the Bruins again Thursday night, winning 79-76 on Strawther's 3-pointer with 7.2 seconds left — five seconds after Amari Bailey hit a 3 to put the Bruins up by one.Just like two years ago, another bruising opponent awaits the Zags in Saturday's West Region final against UConn.“I think we just changed our approach and our mindset, so hopefully be a little bit more prepared for the game tomorrow,” Gonzaga's Anton Watson said.The Huskies have bullied their way through the bracket, winning their first three games by a combined 62 points.UConn has heft inside in 6-foot-9, 245-pound Adama Sanogo and potent perimeter scorers in Tristan Newton and Jordan Hawkins.The Huskies turned what was supposed to be one of the NCAA Tournament's best games so far into a Sweet 16 blowout, overwhelming Arkansas for an 88-65 win Thursday night.An easy win, but the Huskies now have to face a team that's been to the Final Four twice in the previous five tournaments. UConn hasn't been to the Final Four since winning the 2014 national championship.“Obviously, they hit the mark across the board — player development, the culture, the winning, Final Fours, putting guys in the NBA,” UConn coach Dan Hurley said. “They do it with a culture that’s widely respected.”TEAM MEETINGUConn opened the season with 14 straight wins, climbing to No. 2 in the AP Top 25. When the Huskies went into a rut, losing seven of nine, the players called a meeting to see if they could get headed back in the right direction.It worked. UConn won seven of its final nine games and has been playing its best basketball of the season in the NCAA Tournament.“Really, that meeting was just a talk amongst us of stuff we had to do to hold ourselves to a higher standard, the UConn standard,” guard Andre Jackson Jr. said. “It was really just about taking an everyday approach to get better as a team. We all did that, and we made it true.”A FEW NICKNAMESGonzaga coach Mark Few had a not-so-flattering nickname for Drew Timme as a freshman. Three years later, he has come up with a new nickname for the quirky big man.“He’s been The Union Rep the last two years,” Few said. “He’s always on me about length of practice, length of film sessions, days off, etc., etc., etc. So I guess he’s moved up some, right?”So has Watson, whom Few used to refer to as Sleepy Floyd, a reference to the former NBA player.“Sleepy Floyd was because Anton played like he was asleep the first two years,” Few said. “No emotion, so I just threw out Sleepy Floyd. Those guys have no idea how good a player Sleepy Floyd was back in the day. I think (they thought) he was a cartoon character or something.”ROUGH TRIPUConn kicked off its stay in Las Vegas by switching hotels because of unsuitable conditions in its first one.A few hours later, personal items were stolen from the team bus while the Huskies practiced at UNLV's Thomas & Mack Center. UConn filed a police report and a list of the missing items.“It hasn't been that bad,” Hurley said. “We've had some minor inconveniences that we’re not even thinking about because we’re so joyful about being in Vegas and playing, having an opportunity to go to the Final Four.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/25,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846293,"Different types of transfers helped KSU, FAU to Elite Eight","NEW YORK (AP) — To get a sense of where Kansas State and Florida Atlantic sit in college basketball's hierarchy, look at their transfers.The Wildcats have nine players who previously played at other Division I schools, several of whom were productive multi-year starters in mid-major conferences. Most notable among them: Markquis Nowell, the 5-foot-8 point guard who put on the performance of the NCAA Tournament on Thursday night in an overtime victory against Michigan State in the Sweet 16.FAU's transfers — players such as Bryan Greenlee and Vladislav Goldin — arrived at the Boca Raton, Florida, school after compiling thinner resumes at programs in the so-called power conferences. Those moves were more of a leap of faith for both FAU coach Dusty May and the players coming aboard.“Obviously, I was close to home, so that was a bonus,"" said Greenlee, a Gainesville, Florida, native who played sparingly in 19 games at Minnesota as a freshman in 2019-20. “But just interacting with the staff and Coach May for the brief time that I did, I just felt like it was the best move for me.""The Conference USA champions from FAU and Kansas State from the powerful Big 12 will be on equal footing with a trip to the Final Four at stake Saturday night. The ninth-seeded Owls (34-3) face the No. 3 seed Wildcats (26-9) at Madison Square Garden in the East Region final.Kansas State is a testament to the power of the transfer portal in this era of college basketball. First-year coach Jerome Tang had two players on his roster after taking over the Wildcats: Nowell and Ismael Massoud. Both had transferred to Kansas State under former coach Bruce Weber and decided to stick with the new staff.Tang said Nowell and Massoud were two of his best recruiters, helping him land Keyontae Johnson, who was a starter at Florida before a heart condition nearly ended his career; Desi Sills, who started games in each of his four seasons at Arkansas State; and Tykei Greene, who was a second-team all-America East player at Stony Brook.“I knew Markquis, I knew who he was,” said Johnson, who averages a team-high 17.7 points per game. “I seen his game before. I wanted to play with a guard like him.”Nowell was an all-conference player at Arkansas-Little Rock before transferring to Kansas State after the 2020-21 season.Former Kansas State assistant Shane Southwell, now an assistant at Northern Illinois, was the connection that got Nowell to Manhattan, Kansas.Southwell grew up in Harlem, like Nowell. He knew Nowell's father and brother and got to know Markquis when he was still in high school.“The connection was pretty strong,” Southwell said. “Having all the people around him trusting me was very, very important for him. And it was important for me to get it right.”Southwell is convinced Nowell would have popped onto the big stage a few years ago had the pandemic not forced the cancellation of the 2020 NCAA Tournament. Nowell had led Arkansas-Little Rock to a Sun Belt regular-season title.Building on previous relationships is a crucial piece of portal recruiting everywhere.Southwell said he tries to keep track of all the players he comes across as high school recruits, often projecting their career paths with an eye toward possibly recruiting them again out of the portal.A place like Kansas State is an attractive transfer destination for players looking to prove themselves in the Big 12.Southwell said those relationships are even more crucial in mid-major conferences as he scouts players who are in the portal after struggling to fit in at the higher levels of Division I.He said often those players need to have their confidence rebuilt.“You almost have to play therapist. You have to play a counselor,” Southwell said.There is also a lot more projection to do because players transferring down usually haven't been productive at the college level.May got to know Greenlee and guard Jalen Gaffney, who spent three years as a reserve at UConn, during his time as an assistant at Florida.Goldin, a 7-foot-1 center, appeared in the portal after playing 10 games at Texas Tech in 2020-21.Goldin also played internationally with a Russian team and at Putnam Science Academy, a prep school in Connecticut.“(Putnam Science) had all their stuff online, so we studied him thoroughly and knew how good he was,” May said.The next part of portal life May will likely have to deal with after this breakthrough season is retention and keeping top players such as Johnell Davis, Alijah Martin and Nick Boyd from being wooed by the allure of playing in a more high-profile conference.“Without a doubt, it’s going to be fluid every single day,” May said earlier this week. “Luckily I’m still relatively young and have a lot of energy because I don’t think there’s going to be a day where you can just relax and not fear of your phone buzzing.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/25,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846294,"Los Angeles schools, union leaders reach deal after strike","LOS ANGELES (AP) — The Los Angeles Unified School District and union leaders said Friday they reached a deal on pay raises for bus drivers, custodians and other support staff after a three-day strike that shut down the nation's second-largest school system.The deal includes a series of retroactive raises going back to 2021 as well as pay bumps this coming July and January that will collectively hike worker pay by about 30%, said Max Arias, executive director of SEIU Local 99.The deal also sets the district's minimum wage at $22.52; provides a one-time $1,000 raise for any worker who was employed in 2020 in appreciation of their work during the COVID-19 pandemic; and creates a $3 million educational and professional development fund for union members, district Superintendent Alberto Carvalho said at a news conference.Free health care will be provided for any employee working at least four hours a day and their families, he added, calling the deal historic and unprecedented in the nation.“This agreement’s going to make a lot of superintendents very nervous,” he said. “And that’s a good thing. … Elevate the bar and, in the process, elevate the people.”The deal ""elevates the dignity, the humanity of our workforce, respects the needs of our students, but also guarantees the fiscal viability of our district for years to come,"" Carvalho said.He announced the deal alongside Arias and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass. Both sides credited Bass, who took office in December, with helping reach the agreement.The mayor has no authority over the schools but she does have a grandson in the district.The deal must still be voted on by the school board and the full union, which represents about 30,000 workers also including cafeteria employees, special education assistants and other support staff. However it gives them most if not all of what they demanded and is expected to pass handily.Those workers walked off the job Tuesday through Thursday amid stalled talks, and classes for some 500,000 students resumed Friday.Members of United Teachers Los Angeles, the union representing 35,000 educators, counselors and other staff, joined the picket lines in solidarity, lending muscle to the walkout.Teachers waged a six-day strike in 2019 over pay and contract issues, but support staff didn't join and schools remained open.This time Carvalho had warned parents that classrooms would close for safety reasons because both instructors and support staff were taking part. The strike ended up snarling schedules for many parents because schools had to find alternate ways to provide daycare and the meals offered on campuses.The strike has shone a spotlight on the issue of underpaid workers who serve as the backbone of schools across the country.The union said district support staffers earn, on average, about $25,000 per year and many live in poverty or must work several jobs because of low pay or limited hours while struggling with inflation and the area's high cost of housing.Carvalho agreed that what he called indispensable workers were being underpaid.The deal came just days after the union accused the district of engaging in unfair labor practices. Arias noted that another contract must be negotiated next year but added: “There is no strike planned for the foreseeable future.”“Thanks to the parents of Los Angeles and the students of Los Angeles and everyone who stood shoulder to shoulder with our members,” he said.SEIU members have been working without a contract since June 2020, while the contract for teachers expired in June 2022. The unions decided last week to stop accepting extensions.",2023/03/25,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846296,"New York, Las Vegas players shine brightest in March Madness","LAS VEGAS (AP) — Long known as the city that never sleeps, New York has a rival for that title in 24/7 Las Vegas, and in both places, stars shine as bright as the neon lights in Times Square or the Vegas Strip.Two of the biggest moments in this year's NCAA Tournament came in those two cities Thursday night — both thanks to players taking center stage in their hometowns.Kansas State's Markquis Nowell's nearly no-look alley-oop pass while seemingly bickering with coach Jerome Tang quickly went viral. That was one of the New York native's NCAA Tournament-record 19 assists, which broke the 36-year-old record of UNLV's Mark Wade.Down Tropicana Avenue from UNLV's Thomas & Mack Center, Julian Strawther returned to Las Vegas and made a shot from the March Madness logo with 7.2 seconds left that put Gonzaga ahead for good against UCLA.Both players had different day-after reactions, with Nowell overjoyed at making the back pages of the New York tabloids and Strawther preferring to quickly put the big shot behind him and focus on a UConn team playing as well as any this March.Nowell could hardly sleep after living the dream of so many kids who grow up playing basketball on the blacktop courts in and around New York City.After a few hours of shut-eye, Nowell was awoken by a FaceTime call from his older brother, who had something to show him.The Daily News proclaimed him “King of Manhattan,” a reference to both the borough and the city Kansas State calls home. The New York Post dubbed Nowell “The King of New York.”“To be on the newspapers feels surreal,” Nowell said.Former Knicks star Carmelo Anthony was among those in attendance at The Garden to see the 5-foot-8 Nowell and the Wildcats' 98-93 overtime victory against Michigan State. Nowell also had 20 points and five steals.“I’m just embracing it and trying to stay in the moment,” Nowell said. “You don’t get these moments back.”Nowell has played at Melo's gym on the West Side, not far from The Garden, and his relationship with the 10-time NBA All-Star goes back years.“I’ve been trying to catch up with all my family, friends and, of course, celebrities have been reaching out, but it’s just too much coming in right now,"" Nowell said.Anthony congratulated Nowell in person, with a pat on the chest after the game. Nowell said he also heard via social media from Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes as well as NBA All-Stars Donovan Mitchell and Trae Young.“I haven’t gotten a chance to answer all my text messages yet, all my DMs,” Nowell said. “But I see it all.”Nowell also heard from maybe the NBA's greatest little giant, Muggsy Bogues, who at 5-3 played in the league from 1987-2000.“He laid the foundation for smaller guards,” Nowell said.Nowell turned his right ankle during the second half against Michigan State. It didn't keep him out of the game for long. Ice, elevation and rest were prescribed to get him ready for Saturday's Elite Eight game against ninth-seeded Florida Atlantic.Nowell said the ankle was feeling about 85% and he went through third-seeded K-State's closed practice.Strawther doesn't have any apparent physical ailments, but could have the emotions of maybe playing his final college game in Las Vegas when third-seeded Gonzaga faces No. 4 UConn on Saturday. He is projected as a second-round NBA draft pick and could turn pro after this season.But Strawther emphasized the task at hand, and he knows the challenge of facing a UConn team that has won all three tournament games by double digits. It's part of why he also didn't want to get too caught up in the moment of beating UCLA.He said once the team left T-Mobile Arena following the 79-76 victory over UCLA, its focus turned to the Huskies.“Because it's March, there’s no time to dwell on the past and try to live in that moment too much,” Strawther said Friday. “I mean tomorrow’s already game day. That’s what we’ve got our eyes set on.”Experience has been a good teacher in that regard.It was just two years ago that Jalen Suggs crossed midcourt and banked in a shot to also beat the Bruins. That shot put the Bulldogs in the national championship game.Two nights later, Baylor made quick work of Gonzaga with an 86-70 victory that was even more one-sided than the score indicated.That's as close as the Zags have come to winning it all, though this is their sixth appearance in the Elite Eight.This has been one of the more overlooked Gonzaga teams, one that even coach Mark Few said he doubted early in the season. The Zags lost five times this season and their three-year run of being a No. 1 seed ended.“We had some rough patches this year that may have brought some dark times and a little bit of negative energy,” Strawther said. “But at the same time, we did an amazing job of bouncing back and playing through adversity. I think we’ve hung our hats on our ability to fight through adversity and having resilience throughout the season.“In March Madness, that’s a great quality and great trait to have, and it’s already shown up twice in our run so far. Hopefully we can continue this run and be the first team to cut down the nets.”___Russo reported from New York.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/25,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846297,Drag community shows up to protest Nebraska drag show bill,"LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) — A bill that would criminalize exposing anyone 18 or younger to a drag show in Nebraska was the last one to get a public hearing in this year's legislative session late Friday. But those opposed to the bill made sure the final hearing went out with a flash of glitter and sequins.Among scores of people who showed up to voice their opposition were more than a dozen dressed in drag, including heavy makeup, wigs and evening gowns.The bill's main sponsor, conservative Sen. Dave Murman of Glenvil, said the legislation is intended to protect children “from being exposed to overly-sexualized and inappropriate behavior far too early.”The bill defines drag as a performance by someone presenting a gender identity that is different than the performer’s gender assigned at birth. It would make exposing a minor to a drag show a misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in jail. The bill comes amidst a national push by conservatives to restrict drag shows, transgender health care, bathroom access and how LGBTQ topics are discussed in schools.“Those who allow this kind of perversion should be held accountable,” Murman said.But Murman struggled to answer questions from Judiciary Committee members about how his bill would be enforced without violating the constitutional rights of drag performers, parents and others. Sen. Carol Blood, a Democrat from Bellevue asked how he would draw a line between drag and, say, musicians or actors who dress up in makeup and showy costumes for performances.When Murman said the difference would come down to how scantily dressed the performer was, another Democrat, Sen. Wendy DeBoer, asked whether that would include a cheerleader in uniform twerking at a game. Murman said it would not.“What you're doing is cherry-picking a demographic, and that's wrong,” Blood said.The fact that the hearing didn’t begin until after 5 p.m. Friday did little to dissuade the public from turning out to speak on it. The crowd filled the Judiciary Committee hearing room and spilled out nearly 100 deep into the Capitol hallways.Those supporting the bill expressed conspiracy theories of alleged efforts to indoctrinate children into queer society and used words like “groomers” and “woke culture” to describe drag shows.But the vast majority of those attending opposed the bill, including two who identify themselves as Polly Pocket and Baby Girl, who often read picture books to children at an Omaha church's story hour. They defended such events and drag shows as simple fun and read from the children's book “Unicorns Are the Worst!” at a rally held before the hearing to protest the drag bill and another to ban gender-affirming care for minors.“It's just queer people showing queer art,” Polly Pocket said.The church where they perform, Urban Abbey, has been hosting drag story hours since 2018. But last Saturday, the show was interrupted by an emailed bomb threat that also threatened the church's pastor and several staff members.“I have never in my life received an email that said, ‘Today you will die,’” Urban Abbey's pastor, the Rev. Debra McKnight, said. “They listed my home address and the addresses of several staff members.”Sunday service the next day was also interrupted by an emailed bomb threat, she said, noting that Omaha police and the FBI are investigating.The bill could later be advanced or die in committee.",2023/03/25,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846298,Navajo Tech 1st among tribal universities to offer PhD,"A university on the largest Native American reservation in the U.S. launched its accredited doctoral program, becoming the first among more than 30 accredited tribal colleges and universities across the country to offer such a high level degree.The program at Navajo Technical University will be dedicated to sustaining Diné culture and language. Diné is the Navajo word meaning “the people” and is commonly what tribal members call themselves.A celebration is planned on the Crownpoint campus in western New Mexico in April, and the school already started accepting applications for the fall semester.The offering marks a milestone for the university, which already has more than 30 degree and certificate programs spanning science, technology, engineering, business and liberal arts, Navajo Tech President Elmer Guy said.Guy told The Associated Press on Friday that he believes the program in which students will receive a Ph.D. in Diné Culture and Language Sustainability will have a profound impact on the future of the tribe's language and culture. He said he's excited to see how students shape their dissertations.The idea was to create a program that would lead to employment opportunities and effect change for Navajo communities on the reservation that stretches into New Mexico, Arizona and Utah.“I thought it would be important to make that connection,” Guy said, explaining that it's a step beyond the call by tribal leaders for their people to learn the language and stay engaged with their culture. “Individuals will get a degree and they'll be professionals. You have to make it applicable. By making it more meaningful, people will have an interest in it.""The effort is paying off. About 20 students have applied so far and will be vying for five coveted spots in the inaugural class, said Wafa Hozien, an administrator who helped with the program’s creation.A collaboration with other academic institutions and community partners, the doctoral program was developed with the help of tribal elders, university professors and linguistic experts. Community-based research and internships will be part of the curriculum so students gain practical experience they can apply in the real world.Guy said he's hopeful this inspires other tribal colleges and universities to create their own programs.Hozien said Navajo Tech's program represents a paradigm shift in that learning through a Diné lens — with culture and language — creates leaders who can advocate for their people in the judicial system, education, land management, business, technology and health care, for example.Guy said the work done by the university to train court reporters to document Navajo testimony and translators to help with reading ballots during election season already has addressed some of the pressing needs within communities.The possibilities will be even greater as students earn doctoral degrees, he said.“They will be part of solving problems,” Guy said. “These students have energy and creativity, and our job is to give them the tools.”___Montoya Bryan reported from Albuquerque, New Mexico.",2023/03/25,,World

That is when he noticed an SUV caught in the flash floods near Granby.At first, Hoyer thought the car might have been abandoned, but flashing brake lights caught his eye. The lights were blinking as if someone was intentionally tapping the brakes. He got on top of the train tracks near the ditch where the SUV was trapped and saw someone inside.“I could see this elderly woman lying in this car trying to stay in the air bubble,” he said.The 33-year-old quickly called 911, but he said the woman didn’t have much time left as the car continued to sink. Hoyer tried to reach her car from the passenger side, but the current was too strong. He then waded through the cold water before he too was submerged and then lunged, grabbing onto her car.“I got a hold of the back door and started trying to pull the door open. But the vacuum on the door was so tight,” he said.He said he was able to break the seal at the top of her window jam and open the door.“I swear there was only a foot of air gap left in the back part of her car,” he said. “I just grabbed her by both arms and pulled her out of there.”Hoyer rushed to get them both inside his truck to warm up.Jim Channel, assistant Granby fire chief, was responding to a call of an 80-year-old woman trapped in a car when he arrived on the scene. Channel had been called to water rescues by Old Ritchey Road before, but he wasn't surprised to see who was there.“I’ve known the young man all his life, and he will do it again tomorrow,” Channel said of Hoyer. “He didn’t even think about what he was doing.”Channel said he along with other rescue workers attempted to save the women’s three dogs inside the car, who were trapped in cages, but they couldn’t reach them in time before getting called to another water rescue.Hoyer didn’t get a chance to get the woman’s full name. But he said he would like to see her again.“I would love to put my arms around her 'cause she just cried in my arms and told me how thankful she was when the ambulance got there,” he said. “I was so thankful that God put me there to help her.”",2023/03/25,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846300,San Diego State ousts top seed Alabama from March Madness,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — San Diego State coach Brian Dutcher has insisted throughout the NCAA Tournament that if his team plays to its strengths, it doesn't matter what the opposition does.The Aztecs certainly played the way they wanted to against the top overall seed in March Madness.Darrion Trammell and San Diego State used a dominant defensive performance to knock Alabama out of the tournament, bottling up All-America freshman Brandon Miller in a 71-64 victory in the Sweet 16.Trammell scored 21 points while Miller, whose outstanding season was marred by off-the-court complications, was held to nine points on 3-of-19 shooting and had six turnovers.The fifth-seeded Aztecs (30-6) will face sixth-seeded Creighton on Sunday in the South Region final. Each program is seeking its first Final Four appearance.Roughly 30 minutes after Alabama fell, the tournament's final remaining No. 1 seed, Houston, lost 89-75 to Miami, leaving March Madness without a single top seed among its final eight teams for the first time since seeding began in 1979. The other top seeds, Purdue and Kansas, lost during the tournament's opening weekend.“It’s just parity,"" Dutcher said. ""That’s what it is. There’s not a lot of difference between the best team in the country and the worst team in the country. You’re seeing that on this stage.”San Diego State trailed 48-39 midway through the second half before going on a 12-0 run and controlling the game from there. The Aztecs finished with eight blocked shots — five by Nathan Mensah — and forced 14 turnovers.Trammell scored the first eight points of SDSU's big run. He made a 3-pointer, stole the ball from Miller and converted a layup, and then buried another 3.“We're going to go on our run,” Trammell said, “and I just took the opportunities they gave me. I took my shot, and I just made a play on defense. From there, our team was in it. That's when the momentum changed.”So did the Crimson Tide's season.The March Madness run of Alabama (31-6) was clouded by its response to the Jan. 15 fatal shooting of a 23-year-old woman in Tuscaloosa, which led to capital murder charges against a then-Crimson Tide player, Darius Miles.Miller was at the scene of the shooting and has not been charged, but police have said in court documents that Miles texted Miller to bring him his gun. Authorities have said Miller is a cooperating witness, and he did not miss any playing time. Miller received armed security protection during the tournament.Mark Sears had 16 points and Jahvon Quinerly and Charles Bediako scored 10 each for Alabama, which shot 32% overall and a miserable 3 of 27 (11.1%) from 3-point range. The Crimson Tide fell short of the second Elite Eight berth in school history.“We came to this game prepared as much as we could possibly,” Miller said. “I think our shot-making could have been better. Our shot choices could have been better, but it’s just that San Diego’s a good group of guys. They’re vets, so they have a lot of experience. I feel like they came out and played hard.”San Diego State's players knew they had to impose their will on Alabama's deep and gifted roster.“Alabama’s a great team. They have a lot of talented players and individuals,” Trammell said. “We knew it was going to be hard. It was a dogfight. Very physical.”Sears’ layup got Alabama within 66-64 with 46 seconds remaining, but Matt Bradley made two free throws and Micah Parrish followed by making three of four attempts, including two with 17 seconds left.After the final buzzer sounded, Aztecs players and coaches rushed the court and hugged each other in a joyous celebration.Jaedon LeDee finished with 12 points for the Aztecs.San Diego State shot just 38% overall and was outrebounded 52-48, but made clutch shots to rally when Alabama seemed in control behind a faster pace after halftime. A technical foul on Dutcher also seemed to spark his seasoned team, which maintained its physical play and thwarted every attempt by the Tide to rally.BLOCK PARTYMensah and Johnson had emphatic rejections with San Diego State ahead 53-50.Both blocks came on layup attempts by Quinerly. Mensah swatted the first and Johnson rejected a subsequent attempt seconds later. Trammell followed with a step-back jumper for a five-point cushion.BIG PICTURESan Diego State: The Aztecs never seemed fazed by Alabama or Miller. More impressive was their resilience when the game seemed to be slipping away.Alabama: Other than the second-half run that put them ahead briefly, the Crimson Tide seemed out of sorts in multiple ways. The team's reliance on 3-pointers showed its desperation.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/25,,World

Details of the mechanism will be announced in a week, Council of Agriculture (COA) Minister Chen Chi-chung (陳吉仲) said at a meeting of the Central Emergency Operation Center (CEOC) on Friday (March 24).The move follows a spike in cases of pork products being intercepted at the borders, either brought in by passengers or through mail and shipping.Between August 2018 and March 22 this year, Taiwan impounded 5,294 pork items at the borders, 470 of them testing positive for ASF. The four Asian countries of China, Vietnam, Thailand, and Malaysia are the countries from which most violations were reported, according to CEOC.Taiwan has battled to keep the virus away with hefty fines, having stayed free from ASF after 17 Asian countries recorded infections. As of March 20, 121 arrivals had been fined NT$200,000 (US$6,591) each, an alarming figure compared to the 170 cases in the whole of 2022.The authorities believe the surge in pork import incidents can be attributed to revived travel and declined vigilance, hence the need for repeated warnings and new inspection measures.COA is also stepping up a crackdown on swine farms illegally using food waste as feed. Some farmers have turned to kitchen waste due to the rising cost of pig feed.A visitor was fined NT$200,000 for bringing in pork pastry products from Vietnam.

And playing the game the right way. Encouraging out guys to be aggressive and coming doing what they do best.”Five of Boston’s remaining eight games will be at TD Garden as they try to catch Milwaukee in the race for the Eastern Conference’s top playoff seed. The Bucks entered the day with a 2 1/2-game edge in the standings. The Celtics had a half-game lead over third-place Philadelphia.Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla likes how the team has responded recently, going 4-2 on their recent road trip and notching back-to=back wins in which the detail and execution of their game plan was evident.“Our guys have great poise about how this season goes and I think they’re in a good place right now,"" Mazzulla said.Pacers All-Star point guard Tyrese Haliburton had 20 points, nine assists and six rebounds in his first game back from a six-game absence with a combination of a bruised left knee and sprained right ankle.

First, Tatum dropped in a layup off a Marcus Smart steal. Then, Tatum came up with a loose ball and fed Brown for a 26-footer.The Celtics outscored the Pacers 32-21 in the period and started the fourth on a 14-2 run, taking as much as a 29-point advantage.“I think they’re both finding a great balance of being dominant players and being team players. I just think when they do that, our team’s different,"" Mazzulla said. ""Right now they’re very committed to being both.”TIP-INSPacers: Shot 60% (15 of 25) in the first quarter. ...

You're going to have to guard three or four drive-and-kicks, and it's really difficult to do.”After trailing by as many as 13, San Antonio surged ahead to their first second-half lead during a 14-2, third-quarter run. Johnson's driving layup while fouled put the Spurs in front, and he rebounded his own missed free throw to find Devonte' Graham for a kick-out 3 to make it 84-80.From there, the lead changed five times before Washington took it back for good via a 12-4 spurt. Wright fueled that stretch when he hit a runner at the third-quarter buzzer to put the Wizards up 99-98 and followed with a 3 to open the fourth.“It was definitely a big stretch because they started to make a run and we let them stay in the game,” Wright said. “I just thought we had to buckle down and start hitting some shots and getting some stops.”TIP-INSSpurs: Went on a team visit Thursday to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. ... Coach Gregg Popovich said Sochan is still likely to play down the stretch “off and on, when he's feeling good,” despite his recent absences. ... Tre Jones had 10 points and 12 assists.Wizards: Unseld suggested pregame it's unlikely Beal would be playing through his knee injury if Washington was more competitive in the playoff race. “I can't say that for a fact,” Unseld said. “I think it's something that would keep him out, hopefully just for a game or two.” ... Starting F Kyle Kuzma (right ankle sprain) missed his third straight game.TANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORTAlthough the Wizards still retain a chance at reaching the playoffs, with eight games left Kispert said he's not bothered by fans who would rather the team lose to better their odds in the draft lottery.“We're playing to win the game, but at the same (time), they're not wrong,” the second-year pro said. “We had 70 games to win before this, right?

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846310,Miami beats No. 1 seed Houston; all four top NCAA seeds out,"KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — Knocking No. 1 seed Houston out of the NCAA Tournament made Jim Larrañaga feel like dancing.Much to his players' delight, the 73-year-old Miami coach busted moves straight out of the disco era in the locker room Friday night to celebrate an 89-75 Sweet 16 victory that left the tournament without a No. 1 seed among its final eight teams for the first time since seeding began in 1979.Larrañaga is known to dance in the locker room after his biggest wins, and this one in the Big Dance surely qualified.“We were all hyped up,” Jordan Miller said. “We love when Coach L dances. That’s probably the best celebration we could look forward to.”Nijel Pack and Miami (28-7) hit shots from near and far against the stingiest defense in the country as the Hurricanes became only the fifth team this season to score at least 70 points against Houston (33-4).“We just wanted it really bad,” Miller said. “We came into this game as the underdogs. We had a lead throughout the whole game. I wouldn’t say a comfortable lead, but a lead, and we just didn’t want to let up.”The fifth-seeded Hurricanes made their second straight Elite Eight and will play second-seeded Texas in the Midwest Region final. Larrañaga is seeking his first Final Four with Miami and second overall — he took George Mason there as an 11 seed in 2006.About 30 minutes before Houston's loss, top overall seed Alabama fell to San Diego State in Louisville, Kentucky. Fellow No. 1 seeds Purdue and Kansas lost during the tournament's first weekend.The Cougars simply couldn’t stop a multifaceted Miami offense led by Pack’s 3-point shooting. He had season highs of seven 3-pointers on 10 attempts and 26 points.Isaiah Wong’s mid-range game helped get the 'Canes out to a fast start, and he finished with 20 points. Miller hurt the Cougars with his penetration and had 13 points, and Norchad Omier was his usual rugged self under the basket while recording his 16th double-double with 12 points and 13 rebounds.“We emphasized moving the ball and finding the open man, and the guys did such a fantastic job from start to finish,” Larrañaga said. “We only ended up with six turnovers. So that’s the name of the game. And we tied them in rebounding. A great performance by our guys.”It was Pack who hit big shot after big shot, some from near the logo. He was comfortable inside T-Mobile Arena, where he played five games during his two seasons at nearby Kansas State.“It’s a blessing to be back in this arena for sure,"" Pack said. “My teammates found me early and kept me going. They instilled confidence in me from the jump ball. They kept feeding me and telling me to shoot the ball, and I shot it with a lot of confidence, and they were able to go in.”Houston was in the Sweet 16 for a fourth straight time, had won 15 of its last 16 games and had the season-long goal of playing in next week’s Final Four in its home city.“Unfortunately, one off-night and you go home in this tournament,” Cougars coach Kelvin Sampson said. “We just never could get a foothold. We kept climbing, and we’d get ahead of them, and then we just couldn’t put stops together.”Miami used a 16-5 run spanning the halves to go up by double digits, with Omier’s three-point play and Miller’s short bank-in with the left hand making it 47-36 and prompting Sampson to call timeout less than two minutes into the second half.Houston battled back to make it a two-point game, but then Pack made three 3s and Miller and Wooga Poplar hit one each to fuel a 16-2 run that put the Canes ahead 70-53. The lead grew to as much as 17 points, and Houston never got closer than 11 the rest of the way.Walker led the Cougars with 16 points. Jamal Shead added 15 and All-American Marcus Sasser and Tramon Mark had 14 apiece for the Cougars, who shot just 37% overall and 29% from distance.“It was an amazing run,” Sasser said. “Came up short, but the time that we got to spend throughout these months, I couldn’t have asked for nothing better.”Houston — which came into the game as a 7.5-point favorite, according to FanDuel Sportsbook — found itself behind at half for the second straight game after the Hurricanes played their sharpest half of the tournament.Miami turned the ball over just once the first 20 minutes, converted Miami’s six turnovers into 15 points and shot 6 of 14 from distance against the second-best 3-point defense in the country.Pack made four of them, and all were timely. His first three gave Miami leads and his fourth broke a 31-all tie.“The Pack kid, some of the shots he made were shots you hope he takes,” Sampson said. “The problem was he made them. Some of those were Howitzers.”Oh, about that dance Larrañaga did. He said it was to the Commodores’ 1985 song “Nightshift.”Miller gave his coach’s moves a grade of A.“Not an A-plus — it was a little stiff,” Miller said. “But he’s still very mobile for his age.”BIG DAY FOR THE UThe Hurricanes reached the regional final just a few hours after Miami’s ninth-seeded women’s team hung on to beat Villanova and advance to the Elite Eight for the first time. Miami and UConn are the only schools with teams remaining in both tournaments.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/25,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846311,Final No. 1 seed falls as Houston gets blown out by Miami,"KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — The next stop for Houston's resurrected basketball program is the Big 12.The Cougars would've preferred it to be the Elite Eight — and eventually back home for the Final Four.The lone No. 1 seed left in the NCAA Tournament after Alabama fell to San Diego State about 30 minutes earlier, the defensive-minded Cougars didn't stick around much longer Friday night.Houston simply couldn't overcome a 3-point barrage from Nijel Pack, the rebounding of Norchad Omier or the dazzling offense from Miami's talented backcourt in an 89-75 loss in the Midwest Region semifinals.All-American guard Marcus Sasser had 14 points, but missed an open 3 early in the second half when the Cougars made their only big run against the fifth-seeded Hurricanes. Tramon Mark also had 14 points, but eight of them came in the opening minutes. And Jamal Shead tried to put the Cougars on his back, scoring 15, but many of those came with the game already out of reach.It was a frustrating end to a season spent hanging around the top of the AP Top 25.“I’m proud of my team for a lot of things. Unfortunately, one off night and you go home in this tournament,” Houston coach Kelvin Sampson said. “I’m disappointed we lost, sure. A lot of tears in that locker room because they care.""The problems began in earnest for Houston when, trailing 40-36, a foul sent Miami's Isaiah Wong to the line with 4 seconds left in the half — he made both free throws to extend the lead. And while the 50-50 call was enough to get Sampson plenty upset, it was a no-call when Mark was whacked on the wrist on a 3-point try as the buzzer sounded that left the 67-year-old coach on the verge of a technical foul from referee Brian O'Connell.Deflated but not yet defeated, Houston closed within 49-45 on Shead's basket with about 16 minutes left. But that's when Sasser missed badly on a 3-point try that would would have pulled the Cougars within a point, and Jordan Miller's right-place, right-time putback of Wong's missed 3 at the other end put Miami in control again.The Hurricanes quickly stretched the lead to 17 points before cruising into Sunday's game in the Elite Eight.That lead? Far too much for a team that had overcome plenty.There was Sasser, struggling with a groin injury from the American Athletic Conference Tournament, riding the bench for the second half of their NCAA Tournament opener against Northern Kentucky. Yet the Cougars got 16 points from potential one-and-done forward Jarace Walker while shutting down the upstart Norse in a 63-52 victory.With Sasser closer to healthy for a second-round game against Auburn, the Cougars nevertheless dug a 41-31 hole. Yet their senior leader found a way to pour in 22 points, Houston turned up its relentless defense, and they outscored the Tigers 50-23 after the break in coasting to an 81-64 victory and a fourth straight Sweet 16 trip.That’s where their season ended — two wins shy of a national semifinal to be played back in Houston.“We were just taking it game by game. Everybody else was thinking about that,” Sasser said of a hometown Final Four. “Just because it’s in Houston, that don’t mean we get extra points or something like that when we step on the floor. We were just taking it game by game, but we fell a little short.”The Cougars are no doubt looking toward a bright future in the Big 12, where they will begin play next season. After all, the same program that had been to two NCAA Tournaments since Guy Lewis ended his Hall of Fame coaching career in 1986 has now made it to five straight, winning a game in each and making the second weekend in the past four.But it's also the end of an era for Houston.Sasser and Reggie Chaney, crucial cogs in their Final Four team that lost to Baylor in the COVID-19 bubble in Indianapolis two years ago, will never suit up for the Cougars again. It's also possible that Walker, who some believe will be an NBA lottery pick, played his final game for Houston on Friday night.So it was especially somber as Sasser led the Cougars back to the locker room one last time.“It was an amazing run,"" he said. “Came up short, but the time that we got to spend throughout these months, I couldn’t have asked for nothing better. ... It was a great run, for sure.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/25,,World

(AP) — Alex Tuch had two goals and an assist as the Buffalo Sabres beat the New Jersey Devils 5-4 on Friday night.Dylan Cozens and Jack Quinn each had a goal and an assist, Tage Thompson scored his 44th goal, and JJ Peterka had two assists to help the Sabres snap a four-game skid and win for the third time in 13 games (3-8-2). Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen made 27 saves to win for the first time in seven starts.Buffalo remained on the fringes of contention for the final Eastern Conference playoff spot, pulling six points behind Pittsburgh for the second wild card.“We played a really good game and it’s a big step in the right direction,” Tuch said. “I thought we corrected a lot of the mistakes we made in games past. We didn’t let that hang over our heads. We just kept our heads up and went to work.”Jack Hughes had two goals and an assist for the Devils, who have lost five of six (1-3-2). Kevin Bahl added a goal and an assist, and Yegor Sharangovich also scored. New Jersey pulled Akira Schmid after the goalie allowed three goals on seven shots in the first 10:55. Vitek Vanecek made 17 saves in relief.“I didn’t think we were ready to play at a high enough level,” Devils coach Lindy Ruff said. “When a team is not ready to play, that falls on my shoulders.”New Jersey, two points behind first-place Carolina in the Metropolitan Divisioin, entered the night needing one win to clinch a playoff berth for the first time since 2018, and reach 100 points in the standings for the first time since 2012.“Maybe it was some pressure,” Devils defenseman Jonas Siegenthaler said. “We were able to clinch today if we win. Maybe that was kind of in our head.”Hughes scored his 38th and 39th goals five minutes apart to get the Devils within a goal before the midway point of the third period. Hughes also had a goal disallowed late in the second period when the Sabres successfully challenged that Sharangovich was offside.Tuch’s goals in the second period built Buffalo’s lead to 5-2. Jeff Skinner set up Tuch in the high slot at 4:50 into the period, and Tuch tipped in Rasmus Dahlin’s point shot on a power play with 3:22 left for his 32nd goal.Cozens and Thompson scored 39 seconds apart to give the Sabres an early lead.“We haven’t had the first goal in a while,” Dahlin said. “That was big for us. That’s what we needed. Today I felt like we had the swagger back and we just have to go out there and play.”Sharangovich scored for the Devils less than two minutes later, but the Sabres responded when Cozens set up Quinn for the rookie’s 14th goal.“We weren’t mentally sharp,” Ruff said. “We weren’t physically sharp. They skated right by us, skated in alone. We hung our goalie out to dry. When you give them rush chances, that team makes you pay.” Bahl made it 3-2 with 1:14 left in the first when he snapped a shot from the right wall past Luukkonen.THOMPSON TOUGHS IT OUTThompson’s breakaway goal was the 100th of his NHL career.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846315,"Clark's March Madness marches on, Iowa women beat Colorado","SEATTLE (AP) — Caitlin Clark felt it was all happening a little too quick and on the stage of playing in a regional semifinal, Iowa's star needed to slow down for a change.“I felt like I was playing a little frantic. I felt like I was rushed on offense,"" Clark said.In this case, slowing down led to a big second half from Clark and the Hawkeyes.Clark scored 31 points, 18 coming in the second half, and No. 2 seed Iowa shook disappointments the past two seasons and reached the Elite Eight of the women’s NCAA Tournament with an 87-77 win over Colorado in the Seattle 4 Regional semifinals on Friday night.After two straight tournaments where Clark’s season ended in the round of 16 and the round of 32, the Hawkeyes will play for a chance at just the second Final Four berth in school history on Sunday.“Anytime you get to play basketball for this long, it’s really special. None of us want this to end,” Iowa's Monika Czinano said.Clark was the catalyst for Iowa’s big second half, and the first-team All-American finished 11 of 22 shooting with four 3-pointers and eight assists. It was her 11th game this season scoring at least 30 points.But she had plenty of help, especially after Clark sat a chunk of the first half after picking up two fouls.Czinano added 15 points, including a key basket in the paint with 1:10 remaining. Kate Martin scored 16 and McKenna Warnock scored 10. Iowa shot 54% for the game and 59% in the second half.“We shot the ball very well tonight and I’m proud of that because of Colorado’s defense,” Iowa coach Lisa Bluder said. “We scored more points than anybody has all year against their defense. Their defense is very good, but we were still able to shoot over 50% from the field. But you do that when you’re having the balance of four people in double figures.”Iowa (29-6) will face No. 5 seed Louisville in the regional final on Sunday. It’s the fifth Elite Eight appearance for the Hawkeyes, but their only Final Four appearance came in 1993.Frida Formann led Colorado (25-9) with 21 points, but 19 of those came in the first half when her shooting carried the Buffaloes. But Formann was shut down in the second half and fouled out with 6:37 remaining.“I had a lot of space in the first half and my teammates were just finding me. When it’s this stage my job is to shoot the ball so that’s what I’m gonna do,” Formann said. “And then they adjusted defensively and we’re a little tighter.”Colorado pulled within 76-70 on Quay Miller’s 3-pointer with 4:16 remaining and the deficit was down to 78-74 after Jaylyn Sherrod’s steal and layup with 1:40 left. But that was the last push by the Buffaloes as Czinano scored in the paint and Iowa made seven free throws in the final minute.Aaronette Vonleh added 13 points and Miller had 12 points and 14 rebounds for the Buffs.“To be down twice by double digits against Iowa and to be able to fight back and continue to never wilt, never hang our heads and just keep playing, stay the course was awesome,” Colorado coach JR Payne said.DECISIVE RUNColorado lingered far longer than expected, but it was Iowa’s run in the early stages of the third quarter and keyed by Clark that finally gave the Hawkeyes some cushion.Clark started a string of 11 straight points for the Hawkeyes with a driving basket, added a 3-pointer off a loose ball and followed by a steal and layup that gave Iowa a 54-42 lead and forced Payne to burn two timeouts in 2 minutes.Iowa eventually pushed the lead to 62-47 and Colorado could never catch up over the final 15 minutes leaving Clark and her team celebrating before the large Iowa contingent of fans walking off the court.“I guess it was kind of our crowd. It felt like there was a lot of Hawk fans out there. I don’t know if they’ve traveled from the state of Iowa, from the Midwest and if they did, we really appreciate that. And if you’re from out here, we appreciate you coming too,” Clark said.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/25,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846316,Crazy Eight: No top seeds among last 8 in March Madness,"LAS VEGAS (AP) — March has gone from madness to unprecedented.With Miami's win over Houston and San Diego State's takedown of Alabama on Friday night, the men's NCAA Tournament will not have a No. 1 seed in the Elite Eight for the first time since seeding began in 1979.“There’s not a lot of difference between the best team in the country and the worst team in the country,” San Diego State coach Brian Dutcher said. “You’re seeing that on this stage.”Purdue, Kansas, Houston and Alabama are all gone, ensuring the Final Four will not have a No. 1 team for the first time since 2011 and the third overall. The four teams deemed by the NCAA to be the best in the country combined to win five tournament games this year, the fewest by three among No. 1 seeds since the field expanded to 64 teams in 1985.Texas is the lone No. 2 seed remaining after bouncing Xavier out of the bracket 83-71 Friday night under interim coach Rodney Terry. The fewest combined No. 1-2 seeds in the Elite Eight before this year was two (three times).How crazy has it been? The national title game is guaranteed to have at least one of these teams: San Diego State, Creighton, Florida Atlantic or Kansas State. The Aztecs, Bluejays and Owls have never been to the Elite Eight. The Wildcats were picked to finish last in the Big 12.It's also a lock the winning coach will be a first-time champion.“It’s a lot of really good programs in the country that have lost — I mean, we could go down the list of them,” Alabama coach Nate Oats said. “That’s what makes the NCAA Tournament the NCAA Tournament. They’re all good teams.”The madness started in the opening round of the East Region, when fairytale Fairleigh Dickinson wrecked brackets around the world by becoming the second No. 16 seed to beat a No. 1.Goodbye, Purdue.Arkansas was the next giant killer, taking down reigning national champion and West Region No. 1 seed Kansas in the second round.The Sweet 16 turned sour on Friday for Alabama, the bracket's No. 1 overall seed. The Crimson Tide were no match for Dutcher's ball-and-body-hawking San Diego State Aztecs in a 71-64 South Region loss in Louisville, Kentucky. San Diego State is the first Mountain West Conference school to reach the Elite Eight.Miami capped the No. 1 carnage in the Midwest Region by taking apart one of the nation's stingiest defenses in a 89-75 win over Houston in Kansas City, Missouri that had Hurricanes coach Jim Larranaga dancing in the locker room.“Unfortunately, one off-night and you go home in this tournament,” Cougars coach Kelvin Sampson said.On to an Elite Eight unlike any other.___AP Sports Writer Josh Dubow contributed to this report.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/25,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846325,The transformation of abandoned assets — a journey to Siraya National Scenic Area,"As countries around the world have reopened their borders, international travel has been revitalized, and Taiwan is also opening wide its doors to welcome visitors. For this report, we went to the Si­raya National Scenic Area to explore a number of scenic spots that embody the concept of sustainability. These include an old military training site that has been transformed by green architecture, village ruins that have become a large play area, an abandoned betelnut orchard that has been turned into an ecological farm, and a remote community that makes violins from driftwood.The Siraya National Scenic Area (SNSA), located in southwestern Taiwan, has a rich variety of geographic features, including plains, mountains, hot springs, badlands, and reservoirs. Taiwan’s second-largest scenic area, it takes its name from the Siraya indigenous people, who have long lived in the area. Today there are still a number of Si­raya communities scattered through the SNSA, adding cultural richness to the area’s gorgeous natural beauty.Looking out from the Guantian Visitor Center, one can see a large pool of water, a broad meadow, and blue skies. The view puts the observer in a carefree and happy state of mind. (Taiwan Panorama photo)If you want to learn about the Siraya people, a good place to start is the SNSA’s Guantian Visitor Center, located in Tainan’s Guantian District. This green building, opened in 2020, incorporates Siraya elements into its exterior design. The walls are decorated with the eight-petal flower motif that is so common in the cross-stitch embroidery of the Siraya. The building also includes rounded elements modeled on Siraya ritual vessels. The Siraya fill various types of vessels, including bottles, earthenware jars, and cans, with water or wine as offerings to Alid, the ancestors and ancestral spirits that are central to their religious beliefs, and these vessels are a defining feature of traditional Siraya culture.The Guantian Visitor Center houses a permanent exhibition on Siraya culture. It introduces the traditional Siraya diet and customs and displays clothing and handi­craft items.The site on which the visitor center and the SNSA Administration buildings now stand was previously a military field operations training ground that had lain disused for many years. The site’s original hilly ­topography has been retained. On the third floor of the visitor center there is an observation platform where one can take in the outdoor plaza. On a large meadow close to the plaza the word “Si­raya” is sculpted in outsize capital letters, and there is outdoor installation art inspired by the Formosan sika deer, symbolizing the deer herds that once roamed the Jianan Plain. It offers a setting where visitors are sure to take photographs.Chang Li-jung, chief of the recreation section at the SNSA Administration, states that over the past several years they have been holding hiking and cycling events along the Mountains to Sea National Greenway. They have also mapped out the Lingbo Guantian cycling route, which is especially suitable for family outings. Along the way one can see pheasant-tailed jacana active in the water caltrop fields, and learn how Yoichi Hatta pioneered the development of the Jianan Plain irrigation system. This route offers an in-depth taste of Guantian’s natural environment and cultural history.About ten minutes’ drive from the visitor center, we arrive at the Daqi Creative Art Village Base, adjacent to Tainan National University of the Arts (­TNNUA). It looks like an ordinary rural community, but when you walk into the information center (known as “The House of Art Grower”) and pick up a map, it takes you into a magical world in which “village life is fun!”Following the map along the path that winds among the old houses, just around a corner there is a meticulously designed children’s games area. For example, at “Island Hopping 123” one can play Monopoly by throwing small sand bags; at “Flying Catapult” there is a competition to see who can cast a ball the farthest; and at “Diediele Valley” there is a colorful large-sized Jenga set. Other activities include slingshots, quoits, and old-style pinball. Moreover, these facilities are made mostly from materials that were thrown away when the old houses were renovated. For example, water pipes and pieces of wood were nailed together to make catapults, and discarded food steamers were painted in bright colors to make decorative targets. Thanks to these creative ideas, Daqi is alive with the sounds of laughter.The founders of Daqi are two young people, Lin Jian-­ruei and Lo Wan-tsz. Formerly students in the Graduate Institute of Architecture at TNNUA, the two became involved in community revitalization in Daqi when they were still students. Lin’s MA thesis was about renovating Zhongshan Hall, a Japanese-era building in the village, to turn it into a community library. Today it is also a craft classroom where visitors who have gathered natural ma­teri­als from the village can combine them into items such as pinball tables that incorporate the community landscape.The village of Daqi grew up in the 1920s as local residents were displaced by the flooding of Wushantou Reservoir, but was later largely abandoned. The House of Art Grower, created by renovating an idle rice mill in Daqi, opened in 2020 and applies the boutique concept to showcase and sell local produce and crafts. It is also the starting point for family experiential activities in the play area, and after getting a card stamped at the various games spots in the village parents and children can return to the house to exchange the card for ice cream or try out shaved ice with locally grown fruits.Walking around the community, every tumbledown building has its own story. For example, there are beams torn out of an ancestral home that was lost to the reservoir, which were brought to Daqi and used along with woven bamboo wattle-and-daub walls to build an old-fashioned house that tells of Daqi’s early history. The aim of renovation is not to restore the buildings to their original condition, but rather to transform them into play areas. For example, an old house with a collapsed roof was repurposed by installing a slide. The founders, who cherish old things, often find treasures in the old houses, such as a sewing machine or radio, and they use these items to decorate the House of Art Grower. Lo Wan-tsz also came up with the idea of DIY classes for making coasters and hanging planters out of discarded red ceramic roof tiles.The two founders are thinking of holding an arts festival this autumn. Lin Jian-ruei notes that Japan’s Setouchi Triennale art festival has the sea and the Echigo-Tsumari Art Triennale has the mountains, while Daqi is close to Wushantou Reservoir with its mountains, water, and small islands, and has the artistic resources of ­TNNUA on its doorstep. Lin and Lo have plenty of ideas for the festival. For example, perhaps artists can install artworks on the reservoir’s small islands, and people can take boat tours to view them. From water resources and village culture to artistic creativity, there are many ways for Daqi to make the most of its charm.Dream River Explore Farm, an ecological farm located in Chiayi County’s Zhongpu Township, was previously a disused betel nut orchard. Due to past use of herbicides, all that remained on the site was betelnut trees and dead vegetation. But after more than a decade of cleanup and restoration work by husband and wife River Liu and Feng Tang, today it has a vibrant ecology and butterflies dance through the air.“Look, this golden birdwing caterpillar is turning into a chrysalis. It looks as if it is tying itself up with string.” As we follow Liu on a guided nature walk through the farm, he catches a plain tiger butterfly to introduce its coiled mouthparts. A little later he picks up a cater­pillar of the common rose butterfly and lets us touch its “os­me­terium,” a defensive organ that the caterpillars of swallow­tail butterflies use to repel predators. Liu’s motivation for creating this environmental education venue is: “People need guidance to understand the environment.”Embracing the idea of sustainable coexistence with nature, Liu has planted all kinds of edible and nectar-­producing plants, including kaffir lime, blue snakeweed, and Kusukusu eupatorium. On the farm there is even a plant that Liu jokingly calls “the tree that snores”—the rainbow eucalyptus. He loves to invite visitors to put their ears up against the tree trunk and quietly listen to the noise of water being transported through the vascular bundles, which makes the tree sound as if it is snoring.To encourage people to get out into nature, Liu uses Dream River Explore Farm as a mountain forest educational venue. He takes visitors river tracing and tree climbing, and in the summer organizes inner-tube rides down the Yunshui River, which runs past the farm. Liu has also built an environmentally friendly pizza oven where people can make their own pizzas using local produce. Liu and his wife have turned this abandoned betelnut farm into a paradise that both adults and children can enjoy exploring.Within the Siraya National Scenic Area, next to the Zeng­wen Reservoir, there is a small town that is famous for its violins made from driftwood. Violin craftsmanship has become a highlight of the town, and not only have young people originally from this place returned home, even outsiders and foreigners have been attracted to settle there.“Here we can admire the beautiful scenery of the reservoir and get an up-close view of eagles diving to catch fish, or we can go to Shanzhu Island to see wild boar attracted by the sounds of opera....” Wu Yihao, chairman of the Heping Community Development Association, enthusiastically informs us of possible itineraries in his hometown, Chiayi’s Dapu Township. Although he has always found his hometown beautiful, he always felt there was something missing. It was only when a friend performed extemporaneously beside the reservoir that he realized what it was: music.Taking his cue from Cremona, the Italian city of violins, Wu decided to try to drive local development by promoting the making of violins. He invited Huang Shengyan, a violinist and highly experienced violin maker, to come to give classes in violin making three times a week. Wu’s efforts have provided local residents, who had previously all been farmers, with a different kind of lifestyle.Several years have gone by, and the fame of the driftwood violins made in Dapu’s Heping Village has gradually spread. Many people who came here to study violin making have been won over by the local scenery and lifestyle, and decided to stay. Local elders have even organized a string orchestra that does benefit performances. In the future they plan to establish a violin story house, where they will display violins and the stories of their makers, who have carved images of boar heads or eagles on their works, or painted them with colorful patterns. The violins made in the town are not for sale; instead the instruments are used to build connections between people in hopes that even more visitors will come to this community and see its entrancing scenery.(Taiwan Panorama photo)",2023/03/25,155,Travel & Cuisine

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846343,"Shin, Szeryk, Jutanugarn share lead at Superstition Mountain","GOLD CANYON, Ariz. (AP) — Jenny Shin of South Korea had a run of five straight birdies to close out her front nine on the way to a 5-under 67 on Friday and shared the lead with Maddie Szeryk of Canada and Moriya Jutanugarn of Thailand after two rounds of the LPGA Drive on Championship.Jutanugarn raced up the leaderboard, following an opening 67 with a bogey-free 7-under 65 that included an eagle and five birdies. Szeryk pieced together a round that included an eagle and six birdies, including one on her final hole, while Shin used seven birdies to offset two bogeys to get to 12-under 132 at Superstition Mountain Golf and Country Club in the LPGA's first full-field event of the year.American Lilia Vu shot a 6 under and was a stroke off the lead, while South Korea's Na Rin An (67) and American Alison Lee (69) were tied for fifth place at 10 under.No. 3-ranked Jin Young Ko, a winner two weeks ago in Singapore, had a second-round 65 and was among eight players tied for seventh place at 9 under on the crowded leaderboard.The event marks the debut of the tour's new cut policy. The cutline after 36 holes includes the top 65 players and ties advancing to the weekend. Previously, the top 70 players and ties advanced to the final rounds.The cutline fell at 3 under, with 76 players advancing. Two of the big names missing the cut included three-time major winner Anna Nordqvist of Sweden and two-time major champion Brook Henderson of Canada, both at 1 under.Shin, looking for her first win since 2016, overcame a sluggish bogey-birdie-par-bogey start to the second round and then went on a birdie tear on Nos. 14 through 18, her front nine, to get to 11 under. She went bogey free on her back nine and added a birdie at the par-4 third hole to get to 12 under.Shin said she was surprised by unexpected swirling wind at the start of her round, and didn’t immediately realize her string of birdies.“The bogey on the first hole didn’t help,” the 30-year-old said. “I was like, ‘Oh, no. Here we go again.’ I stayed calm. I try not to get in my head too much. ... So I didn’t know I was doing five in a row until I just checked the scorecard. So it’s a good thing that I didn’t know.”The highlight of Jutanugarn’s round was her eagle at No. 7, where she hit a good drive that finished on the cart path. After a drop, she got a favorable bounce on her second shot that settled on the back of the green, and she made the putt for an eagle 3.“The next two days just trying to go out and have fun and do what I should do, what is under my control,” the 2013 rookie of the year and two-time tour winner said. “I think, of course, it’s more fun when you feel like you’re in contention.”The 26-year-old Szeryk, in her second year on tour after a rookie campaign that included making five cuts in 14 events in 2022, sees being tied for the lead after 36 holes — and whatever follows — as a learning experience.“It’s so amazing to be back in this position because I love being out here and I’m just so thankful to God to have another opportunity to be out here and to really compete with the best players, she said. ”But I’m just on such a high.“Just really excited for what the weekend has in store. ... But it was great to see those putts go in and make those birdies coming down the stretch.”Second-ranked Nelly Korda, the highest-ranked player in the field with No. 1 Lydia Ko not competing, followed an opening 70 with a 66 and was among those tied for 15th at 8 under.Also at 8 under was Yuka Saso, but her route to a tie for 15th was highlighted by her first albatross, when she made a 2 on the 492-yard, par-5 second hole.Saso used a hybrid from 217 yards ou t on her second shot and knew the approach was online with the pin.“I mean, we didn’t really know where it landed and where it finishes, so we were just walking to the green and everyone started clapping,” she said. “But my ball wasn’t on the green so I was like, why are they clapping? Is it over? Why is everyone clapping if it’s not on the green?”It turns out her playing partner, Sei Young Kim, looked into the hole and let her know it was in.“It was one of my dreams to get one, but we all know how hard it is to get one,” Saso said. “They say you’re lucky if you ever get one in your golf career. I guess I was very lucky to have it.”___AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/25,,World

(AP) — Luke Kennard made a franchise-record 10 3-pointers to match his career high with 30 points, Desmond Bane added 25 points and the Memphis Grizzlies clinched a playoff spot after building a 31-point halftime lead and coasting to a 151-114 victory over the Houston Rockets on Friday night.Kennard, acquired from the Los Angeles Clippers in a trade deadline deal Feb. 9, connected on 10 of 11 shots from outside the arc — only the second player in NBA history to score 30 points all on 3-pointers. Bane was 5 of 7 from 3-point range as Memphis made 25 3-pointers to set a franchise mark.“When you start hitting a couple in a row, usually about three for me, I start feeling it a little bit,” Kennard said. “It’s the kind of thing where once it leaves your hand, you think it’s going in. So, it was pretty fun.”Ja Morant scored 18 points and had eight assists in his second game after serving an eight-game league-imposed suspension after he posted a video in which he is shown waving a gun at a Denver-area strip club. Morant, as he did in his first game back Wednesday night also against the Rockets, again came off the bench. He entered with 5:08 left in the first quarter.Jaren Jackson Jr. also scored 18 points and had seven rebounds and two blocks for Memphis, which had the second-most points in franchise history. The Grizzlies won their 11th straight at home and moved within three games of idle Denver, which holds the top spot in the Western Conference.Memphis clinched the Southwest Division on Wednesday night, but weren’t assured a playoff berth until its victory Friday night since division winners don't automatically earn playoff spots.Tari Eason had 21 points to lead Houston, while Kevin Porter Jr. and Jabari Smith Jr. each had 20. Porter also had seven assists and six rebounds. Smith grabbed eight boards.Unlike Wednesday night's game between the teams that was closely played, Memphis put this one out of reach in the first half. The Grizzlies shot 60% overall in the half, connected on 14 of 25 from outside the arc and built the advantage to as many as 31 with an 83-52 lead at the break.“We weren't physical with them. They were physical with us,” Rockets coach Stephen Silas said. “We were just letting them run around wherever they wanted. Obviously, Kennard got going and we were just late (defending the 3-point line).”While Memphis isn't normally known for its 3-point shooting, Silas noted that Kennard and Bane combined to make 15 long-range shots.""Kennard was 10 for 11. The guy was going,"" Silas said.For Kennard, it was the best game for Memphis since the trade. Soon after he arrived, he was reluctant to take shots as he became more comfortable with his new team. From coaches to players, all have encouraged him to take his shot.“Obviously, he's coming out talking about how we've been on him, his teammates have been on him talking about being more aggressive,” Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846354,Delicacies made with time and salt— pickled seafood and mullet roe,"People living in coastal areas pickle fresh seafood with salt, and just a single piece of pickled seafood is enough to flavor a whole bowl of rice, traditionally supplying the needs of the simple daily lives of ordinary people. Meanwhile mullet roe, which was once only consumed at banquets or at the Lunar New Year, symbolizes abundance. Eating pickled seafood not only signifies experiencing the transformation in flavor brought about by time and salt, it also means sampling the traces of the culture of an era.We arrive in the Annan District of Tainan City, located on Taiwan’s Southwest Coast, where we follow Tsai Teng-chin, chairman of the Deer Ear Community Development Association, as he goes to a market to do some shopping in preparation for making kiâm-kê (seafood or meat pickled with salt).As he watches a woman deftly shucking an oyster, Tsai recalls his memories of eating kiâm-kê as a child. Anything including small fish, shrimp, edible bivalves, and crabs could be made into pickles. “One oyster was enough to go along with a whole bowl of congee,” says Tsai, speaking in Taiwanese as he shares his childhood experiences. Although there is not much meat on a small fish or shrimp, the combination of seafood and large amounts of salt was enough to stimulate the appetite and to flavor a big bowl of rice congee.Women and children gathered various kinds of seafood including fish, shrimp, crabs, snails, and bivalves, and pickled them with salt to make delicious kê-tsiap sauce. For residents of the Saltland, this was an element of dietary culture well suited to the local terroir. (Taiwan Panorama photo)Tseng Pin-tsang, an associate research fellow at the Institute of Taiwan History at the Academia Sinica and an expert on Taiwanese culinary culture, says there is a long history of eating kiâm-kê in Taiwan. Since the Ming and Qing dynasties, residents of China’s Fujian and Guangdong provinces and Taiwan’s West Coast have pickled fresh seafood to preserve it by fermentation, turning it into kê-tsiap sauce. When researching Taiwanese gentry families of the Qing Dynasty, Tseng came across evidence of the consumption of kiâm-kê in the account books of the Lin Family of Wufeng in Taichung, with clear records of the purchase of pickled oysters and crowned turban snails.While people all over Taiwan have consumed kiâm-kê, Tseng says that pickled foods are an essential part of the diet of residents of Taiwan’s Southwest Coast.Large parts of the southwestern coastal region of Taiwan, from Chiayi in the north to Tainan in the south, were once covered by various lagoons, such as the Taijiang and Daofeng lagoons. Silt carried down by rivers was deposited in the lagoons and at the coast, continually creating shifting areas of new land, with sandbars, lagoons, tidal creeks, mangroves, and rivers that often changed directions and overflowed their banks. The soil here often contains high levels of salt, and when you add in the sand blown about by the winter seasonal winds, conditions did not favor agriculture and residents mainly had to rely on fishing, fish farming, and making bay salt. In literature, this area was called “the Saltland.”Although life was difficult, given the abundant aquatic life in the lagoons and the development of the bay salt industry, local women and children were able to gather all kinds of fish, shrimp, snails, and crabs in the intertidal zone, and use salt to pickle them to make kê-tsiap sauce. For residents of the Saltland, where potable water and fuel for fires where hard to come by, kiâm-kê that could be eaten without cooking became an important element in local culinary culture.Tsai Teng-chin demonstrates how oysters are pickled. First they are rubbed with a little salt to clean them, then rinsed multiple times in a pan until the ­water becomes clear. Next the moisture is drained away and salt and ginger are added. The oysters are then sealed in a jar for three to seven days to ferment, after which they are ready to eat. They taste both salty and sweet, and they really go well with rice.Due to changing times and the evolution of modern people’s diets, traditional kiâm-kê has largely disappeared from the daily lives of Taiwanese. However, few people know that this food gave rise to a global phenomenon: ketchup.According to research by Dan Jurafsky, a professor of linguistics at Stanford University, people on China’s southern coast were using salt to pickle fresh fish as early as the 5th century CE. In the 17th century, after Europeans arrived, the local pronunciation of the sauce they made using pickled fish, kê-tsiap, became the English word “ketchup.” Kê referred to pickled fish, while tsiap (tchup) meant sauce. Europeans brought fish sauce back to their home countries, and eventually all methods of producing sauce through pickling were called ketchup. After the tomato was introduced into Europe, it too was pickled into a sauce, and the meaning of the word ketchup gradually changed to refer to sauce that no longer included seafood. This is the origin of the tomato ketchup so familiar to us today.(Taiwan Panorama photo)Mullet roe is another salted food with a long history.Mullet fishing and the production of salted mullet roes was booming along the coast of Taiwan by the early 1600s. During the era of Dutch colonial rule (1624–1662) there was even a tax on ships that came to Taiwan to catch mullet.Later, under Japanese rule (1895–1945), techniques for processing mullet roe continually improved. Even today, mullet roe is still a prized gift at the Lunar New Year and is a representative seafood product of Taiwan. We came to one of Taiwan’s leading mullet roe pro­du­cing areas, Kouhu Township in Yunlin County, to visit brothers Zhuang Guo-xian and Zhuang Guo-sheng, who have won top prize in the national mullet roe competition four years running.Amber-like mullet roes are drying in the sun outside the processing plant. They are not of a deep red color, as most people think, and they give off a fresh sea fragrance as the sea wind blows over them. The key to their aroma lies in the fact that before the mullet are brought up out of the aquaculture ponds, Zhuang Guo-xian first makes a cut in them with a knife to bleed them, thereby avoiding the distasteful odor that may arise if blood contaminates the fish eggs. After being taken out of the pond the fish are carried by low-temperature transport to the processing factory, where roe extraction teams await. When the truckloads of mullet are offloaded, the workers form up into groups of three to harvest the roes. In a seamless operation, one person slices open the fish belly, another separates the fish roes from the fish meat, and the third takes the fish and removes the roes.Next, blood still remaining in the blood vessels, and any unwanted mucosal tissue, must be scraped off the roes by hand. Freezing the roes for several days increases the resiliency of the mucous membrane on the surface, and only then can the roes be processed into a finished product.Mullet roe is treated with salt and time to give it that oily fragrance. (Taiwan Panorama photo)The Zhuang brothers, who insist on using eco-friendly aquaculture methods, do not use any additives when making their mullet roe. Following advice from experts, the brothers began using the cold air drying technique to produce their mullet roe. This has shortened the time the roes must be sun-dried, avoids bacterial contamination, and reduces the amount of salt needed as a preservative compared to the traditional method, so that their mullet roe meets the contemporary demand for low sodium content in foods.We watch as Zhuang Guo-xian places the roes into a basin of salt mixed with kaoliang liquor from Kinmen. After the roes are coated in salt, they are turned over to Zhuang Guo-sheng, who lays them out on wooden boards. Then blocks of concrete are placed on top to squeeze out the liquid and allow the salt to penetrate evenly through the roe. The curing time is rigorously controlled based on the size of the roes, and when the time is up the salt must immediately be washed away. Then the roes are placed outdoors to be exposed to the sea breezes and sunshine.Then the roes have to be turned over, after which any tears in their skins are covered with casing made from pig intestine, and their positions are adjusted to even out differences in thickness among the roes placed on the boards. Next concrete blocks are again placed on top to press on the roes with evenly distributed weight. After sun-drying, the mullet roes are placed in a cold-air drying room to continue to draw out moisture. As if taking care of young children, the two brothers inspect the proceedings several times each day. If you include the time it takes to raise mullet fry into adult fish capable of producing roes, the whole process takes two to three years. The ponds need to be inspected countless times each day and the fish treated with special care to finally be able to harvest the roes. It is only at this point that we understand how complex the process of making mullet roe is. No wonder Zhuang Guo-xian proudly says that the procedure for making mullet roe is comparable to hand-crafting luxury handbags.(Taiwan Panorama photo)Sun-drying of mullet roes by fishing households is an enchanting part of the scenery on Taiwan’s West Coast. (Taiwan Panorama photo)There are many ways to enjoy mullet roe, including pan-frying it in oil, roasting it over a fire, and adding it to fried rice or Italian pasta. In recent years there has been a fad for cutting the roe into slices and sandwiching it between pieces of juicy fruits and vegetables such as pears, apples, or cassava. Zhuang Guo-xian shares his own favorite method of eating mullet roe, which is to sprinkle kaoliang liquor on top and broil it with a hand-held torch, after which it can be sliced up and consumed. In this way the outside is crisp while the inside is firm, and with each bite your mouth is filled with the aroma of fresh fish and fat.Whenever mullet roe is discussed, there is contention over whether wild or farmed mullet produce better roes, but in fact each type has its own strengths and weaknesses. Hsu Zong, director of the Taiwan Culinary Arts Association, who has long studied the flavor of food ingredients, points out that wild mullet living in the sea are omni­vorous, creating a rich variety of tastes in their roe. Nonetheless, because in the last few years the techniques for raising mullet in aquaculture have improved, this type of roe has gotten more and more positive attention.Hsu says there are three reasons for this: The first is that bleeding the fish results in roes with a beautiful color and luster. The second is that with the trend in recent years for reducing salt use, the feed given to farmed mullet and the timing of when they are removed from their ponds can be adjusted, and these steps, along with research into how to precisely apply salt, enable the fat-rich roe to manifest its finest flavor. The third is that business and academia have worked together to upgrade mullet farming techniques and technology. For example, Zhuang Guo-xin and Cheng Ann-chang, chairman of the Department of Aquaculture at National Kaohsiung University of Science and Technology, have worked together to use photo­synthetic bacteria to improve the ecology of fish ponds and reduce the risks involved in mullet aquaculture. All of these factors have raised the profitability of mullet farming, attracting more people and investment into the industry and building relevant expertise in Taiwan.Hsu has been delighted by the continual refinement of mullet roe in Taiwan, which has inspired him to try out all kinds of variations in its preparation. For example, he has paired mullet roe with ‘Megumi’ variety apples, with the green garlic produced in different areas, and with gin flavored with local materials, contrasting these with the enchanting flavor of pickled seafood. As he says, “There’s no end point to the search for perfection; instead you have to continually think up interesting new ways to look at mullet roe and other foods.”",2023/03/26,900,Travel & Cuisine

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846373,US charges alleged Russian spy who tried to infiltrate ICC,"The US Department of Justice unveiled charges Friday against a Russian man accused of studying for years under an assumed Brazilian alias at a Washington university, who later tried to join the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague.He was caught soon after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, when trying to move to the Netherlands and take up an internship at the court, which is now seeking President Vladimir Putin's arrest.The US indicted Sergey Vladimirovich Cherkasov on multiple offenses that took place during the roughly two years he spent in the US.Many of the charges are fraud-related and pertain to Cherkasov's effort to secure his visa, a Virginia state driving license and other documentation under the assumed Brazilian identity Viktor Muller Ferreira.US Attorney Matthew M. Graves said, ""When foreign adversaries, such as Russia, send undercover operatives into the United States, we will find them and prosecute them to the fullest extent of the law.""The indictment portrays Cherkasov as one of Russia's ""illegals,"" the name given to a notorious network of sleeper agents posing as American citizens under non-official cover in the US.Ten such ""illegals"" were arrested in a major 2010 operation.The US charges Cherkasov operated as an agent for Russian intelligence services from 2012 to 2022 mostly in Brazil under his new identity. The Netherlands earlier had named the GRU military intelligence agency.He spent roughly two years between 2018 and 2020 in the US on an international studies master's degree program at Johns Hopkins University. He began the application process to study there in 2017.The US accuses Cherkasov of fraudulently though successfully applying for university admission, a visa, a bank account, a Virginia state driving license and other documentation under his alias.""Cherkasov further made connections to persons of interest in the United States"" while maintaining a line to his Russian intelligence service handlers, the indictment states, adding, ""Cherkasov obtained information about US persons that he passed"" onto those handlers.The Justice Department also said that the suspect ""continued to use his connections"" at university ""to obtain information about US foreign policy"" and pass it on to Russian intelligence in 2021 and 2022.This could set the stage for a battle with Russia over securing the 39-year-old's extradition. However, Friday's indictment did not make clear when or if the US would seek his extradition.Cherkasov was arrested in Brazil in April 2022 after being detained and deported from the Netherlands for using fake identity papers as he came to The Hague to try to take up a job at the ICC.The Netherlands' AIVD intelligence service then released details of the case and his arrest last June.A few weeks later, in September, Moscow formally requested that Brasilia extradite Cherkasov to Russia, alleging that he was wanted there on narcotics charges.The culmination of Cherkasov's decade undercover in the Americas was to use his qualifications and presumed Brazilian identity to seek employment at the International Criminal Court.By the time of his arrest last April it already seemed highly probable that the ICC would be investigating Russia's invasion of Ukraine.The Netherlands said in June that had Cherkasov become an ICC intern as planned, he would have access to the organization's systems and would have been able to gather intelligence there. The Dutch said he might even ""have been able to influence criminal proceedings of the ICC.""The ICC issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin this month over the alleged abduction of Ukrainian children.Russia is not a signatory to the court and does recognize its jurisdiction or cooperate with its investigations.Former President Dmitry Medvedev said that any ICC member state looking to follow through on the arrest warrant against Putin while he was still president would be risking an act of war.msh/ar (AFP, AP, Reuters)",2023/03/25,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846378,"Old-time treats, old-time flavors","In the Taiwan of 40 to 50 years ago, the best-selling summertime treat was “four fruit ice,” which was made by taking a big bowl of shaved ice and covering it with a compote typically consisting of shredded papaya, candied yellow plums, dried carambola, and salted red plums. Old folks one and all associate this treat with happy memories.Taiwan produces fruits in huge quantities and bewildering variety. Farmers in times past found outlets for their big fruit harvests by pickling the fruit in sugar and salt, thus extending their shelf life. Some such fruit products, like green mango, became very popular snack items. Candied fruit in Taiwan is produced principally in Changhua County’s Baiguo Mountain, Tainan City’s Anping District, and Yilan County’s Jiaoxi Township. Candied fruits these days are made in factories, but some candied fruit makers have been in business for over a century, and the rich flavors of their products show through in the histories of these firms.Huang Wan-ling, a gourmet writer and vigorous promoter of Taiwanese cuisine who is known for her lavish “rich folk’s” banquets, starts off the banquets with a four-item “welcoming course” of candied fruits that call to mind the old-time flavors of yesteryear. Huang emphasizes that the flavors of the four different types of candied fruit have to be mutually complementary, so choice of fruit is an exacting process. She goes with shredded papaya, candied plums, Chinese olives (Canarium album), and seedless dried plums.“Four-fruit tea” is another special treat, made by taking candied fruits, steeping them in piping-hot water, and sprinkling a bit of plum powder over the tea in a ceramic mug. When drinking the tea, one uses the cup lid to keep from drinking in the fruit, while stirring the tea to ensure that the flavors are evenly concentrated. For Huang Wan-ling, the savory-sweet flavor is unforgettable, not to mention the pleasure, after finishing the tea, of taking out a fork and eating the candied fruits at the bottom of the mug. Says Huang: “Once the tea itself has gone bland, the fruits bring yet another type of flavor.” However, virtually no teahouses sell four-fruit tea nowadays because an indispensable ingredient, shredded papaya, is now exceedingly hard to come by.Rainfall in Yilan County is abundant and the soil is well drained, making it perfect for growing kumquats. (Taiwan Panorama photo)There are now only two makers of candied fruits in Taiwan that have been around for more than a century. One of them, Lao Jan Sow, is located in Yilan City. The other, Chycutayshing, does business in Tainan. Historical records related to the history of candied fruits in Taiwan are scarce, but household registration documents dating to the Japanese colonial period show that Zhu Yingbin, the founder of Lao Jan Sow (original name: Lao Shou Tang), was an apothecary. Besides running a pharmacy, he also sold candied fruits that had been made using certain Chinese medicinal materials. When customers came in for medicines, they would pick up some candied fruits while there, and this sideline became well known over time.Upon entering Lao Jan Sow today, one notices in the doorway a photo of an award that the shop won during the Japanese colonial period. Business is brisk. Some customers say they want to send candied fruits to Taiwanese friends who are living overseas and are no doubt missing treats from back home.The older sister of today’s fifth-generation proprietor recalls how honeyed kumquats were made during her childhood. Fruit farmers would bring in baskets full of kumquats, which would be sorted by size and set in barrels to soak in water. The kumquats were rinsed clean using copious amounts of water, then steeped in sugar in ceramic vats. After this they were again rinsed before being placed to simmer in sugar water and malt syrup, and finally being drained. This sort of traditional production process, however, cannot keep up with today’s high demand for candied fruits, which is why Lao Jan Sow has switched to using a factory.Kumquats are one of “the three treasures of Yilan,” and are a shared memory for local people. (Taiwan Panorama photo)According to a survey by the Council of Agriculture, some 90% of all kumquats in Taiwan are from Yilan County, grown primarily in the area around Jiaoxi and Yuanshan. Due to the abundant rainfall and well-drained land, the area has come to be known as “the hometown of the kumquat.”In discussing honeyed kumquats, local cultural historian Zhuang Wensheng starts by commenting on the locations of Yilan’s kumquat sellers. Many of the shops that sell honeyed kumquats are concentrated along Zhongshan Road in Yilan City. During the Qing Dynasty, all the local shops and Chinese medicine apothecaries were located here. Zhuang recalls that when he was a child, the people at virtually every business in this area would busily process kumquats in front of their shops throughout the kumquat season (November to March). Entire streets took on an orange hue, and Zhongshan Road was once known as “kumquat street.”With kumquats, the peel is sweet while the fruit is sour, which is why the people of Yilan used to “poke the kumquats,” meaning that they would first use an implement to squeeze out the sour juice before proceeding to candy them. During the Lunar New Year holidays some people would display a platter of kumquats on their dining table because the pleasingly round and plump shape calls to mind an image of good fortune and togetherness. An old saying holds that “kumquats make the year go great.”In addition, kumquats help the lungs and moisten the throat, and Yilan is where Taiwanese Opera got its start. Some say that performers eat a few kumquats or drink a cup of kumquat tea before taking to the stage because it helps them sing better.The traditional method of candying fruits was time-consuming, and cannot keep up with today’s high demand. This has prompted many makers of candied fruits to use additives like sweeteners, saccharin, and preservatives. However, there is one maker in Yilan, Agrioz, that insists on using nothing other than sugar and salt, and carefully controls the indoor environment where the processing takes place.First-generation proprietress Hong Meifang, a former instructor in food processing at the Ilan Institute of Agriculture and Technology, states that when making honeyed kumquats, if sugar and salt are added in the proper quantities and the moisture content of the fruit is well controlled, the result will be a natural preservative effect.To help consumers get more familiar with kumquats, which rank as one of “the three treasures of Yilan,” the Agrioz Museum + Cafe allows visitors to view part of the production process, displays lots of photos of kumquat farmers, and provides guides to describe what the visitors are seeing. Hong Meifang explains: “Harvesting kumquats is very tough work. Every kumquat on a tree is at a different degree of ripeness, so they cannot be mechanically picked all at once. Farmers absolutely must pick the fruit by hand, one at a time.” There is also an area in the museum where visitors can try their hand at making kumquat jam and steeping kumquat tea. President Tsai Ing-wen once visited the museum and took part in these hands-on activities, and the government of Haiti, a diplomatic ally of Taiwan’s, once dispatched people to come to the museum and learn how to process and market kumquats.During the Qing Dynasty, people turned up their nose at the very mention of sour kumquats, but clever people a few generations back figured out a way to candy them, thus turning them into mouth-watering treats. There are also many other kinds of candied fruits—such as dried Chinese olives flavored with licorice, and dried plums—that are quintessentially Taiwanese treats. The next time you boil up some tea, it wouldn’t hurt to heed a suggestion put forward by the gourmet writer Huang Wan-ling, who said: “Take just a sip of tea and a bite of candied fruit, and you’ll understand the savory sweetness and tartness that we in Taiwan remember as the old-time flavor of traditional treats.”Pickling fresh fruits eliminates the sour taste of the peel, softens the fruit inside, and has a preservative effect.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846383,Texas police: Migrants found 'suffocating' in train; 2 dead,"UVALDE, Texas (AP) — Two migrants were found dead and at least 10 were hospitalized Friday after police in South Texas received a call that they were “suffocating” in a freight train traveling near the U.S.-Mexico border.The Uvalde Police Department said Border Patrol was informed of the phone call and able to stop the train. About 15 migrants were found inside, according to a statement from the department.Union Pacific railroad said in a statement that the people were found in two cars on the train traveling east from Eagle Pass bound for San Antonio: 12 in a shipping container and three in a hopper car. The two people who died were in the shipping container, the statement said.At least four people were air-lifted to San Antonio, authorities said, while others were taken to local hospitals.The condition of all of those hospitalized was not immediately known. University Health in San Antonio tweeted that it had received two male patients, one in critical condition and one in serious condition.Uvalde Police Chief Daniel Rodriguez told the San Antonio-Express News that dispatchers received a 911 call about 3:50 p.m. from an unknown person seeking help. The train was stopped near the town of Knippa, which is less than 100 miles (161 kilometers) from the southern border.“We’re still trying to determine if it was from someone inside the car,” Rodriguez said. “We’re assuming it was from inside one of the cars.”Uvalde police said that Union Pacific railroad would lead the investigation.In a statement, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas suggested the deaths and injuries were linked to human trafficking and pledged to hold those responsible accountable.“We are heartbroken to learn of yet another tragic incident of migrants taking the dangerous journey,” Mayorkas said on Twitter. “Smugglers are callous and only care about making a profit.”A cause of death Friday was not immediately clear. Highs in the area neared 90 degrees (32.2 Celsius), and shipping containers often get much hotter than the surrounding temperature.Last summer, more than 50 migrants died after dozens of people were found in the back of a sweltering tractor-trailer that had been abandoned on the outskirts of San Antonio. The tragedy was the nation's deadliest smuggling episode on America's southern border, which led to officials vowing to step up policing efforts.Migrants routinely travel through Uvalde, leading to high-speed vehicle pursuits that put schools in the area on lockdown. After the Robb Elementary School massacre in Uvalde last May, when a gunman killed 19 children and two teachers, Texas lawmakers concluded in a report that the frequency of the lockdowns may have led to a “diminished sense of vigilance"" about security.Union Pacific said it was “deeply saddened by this incident and the tragedies occurring at the border. We take the safety of all individuals seriously and work tirelessly with law enforcement partners to detect illegal items and people riding inside or on our rail cars.”On the other side of Texas, a 17-year-old was charged Friday with kidnapping two migrants whose rescue this week from a Houston hotel by FBI agents ended in gunfire that killed another suspect.The migrants were stopped on a highway northwest of Houston on Saturday and were forced into another vehicle by the kidnappers, according to a prosecutor. Officials have said little about what happened between then and Thursday morning, when the FBI says its agents rescued two migrants following the shooting in north Houston.",2023/03/25,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846385,Creighton ends Princeton's March Madness run with 86-75 win,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — Creighton coach Greg McDermott understood what his team needed to do if it wanted to make school history.Ryan Kalkbrenner, the Big East's two-time defensive player of the year, had to use his 7-foot-1 frame to overwhelm Princeton's defense. And 3-point specialist Baylor Scheierman needed to show what he could do defensively. Together, they teamed up to end Princeton's March Madness run.Kalkbrenner scored 22 points, Scheierman had 21 and sixth-seeded Creighton marched on with an 86-75 victory over the 15th-seeded Tigers on Friday night that sent the Bluejays to their first Elite Eight since being part of an eight-team NCAA Tournament in 1941.""It’s been amazing, it’s been a dream come true. This is why I came to Creighton in the first place, to make a run with this group of guys,” Scheierman said after making five 3-pointers and harassing Princeton's perimeter players. “It’s just been an incredible experience. I’m looking forward to continuing that on Sunday.”Next up for Creighton is No. 5 seed San Diego State in the South Region final, with each team seeking its first Final Four. The surprising matchup could be entertaining because of the teams' contrasting styles.For Creighton to advance, Friday's big stars may need to duplicate their performances against the rugged Aztecs, particularly Kalkbrenner, who was 9 of 12 shooting despite a brief first-half benching because McDermott thought his big man's attitude needed work.“He just basically told me, get that frustrated look off my face and play with a little joy and have fun,” Kalkbrenner said. “I fixed it after that.”Soon after, the Bluejays (24-12) were celebrating.The Tigers (23-9) were led by Ryan Langborg with 26 points and Ivy League player of the year Tosan Evbuomwan with 24 points, six rebounds and nine assists.Princeton shook up brackets everywhere by beating No. 2 seed Arizona in the first round, then blew out seventh-seeded Missouri last weekend in Sacramento, California, to make its first Sweet 16 since 1967.Princeton was seeking become the first Ivy League champ to make the Elite Eight since Penn’s Final Four run in 1979, the first Tigers squad to reach the Final Four since Bill Bradley led them there in 1965, and the second straight No. 15 seed to play in a regional final. Saint Peter's last year became the first 15 seed to achieve that feat.The Tigers came up short.“We had seen great size and length against Arizona, but we hadn’t seen Kalkbrenner’s agility and the speed, the way they were getting him the ball in different positions,” coach Mitch Henderson said. “I thought he was the key. They just got easy, easy baskets when they needed them.”Princeton's offense bore no resemblance to the back-cutting, deliberate style that defined the late Pete Carril’s coaching tenure. Instead, the Tigers went toe to toe against fast-paced Creighton until stalling out at the start of the second half.Creighton used a 9-2 run to take 56-45 lead, a four-minute stretch during which Henderson called two timeouts and Evbuomwan drew his third foul.Nothing could stop the Bluejays, though. When Princeton cut the deficit to 61-52, Creighton answered with seven more points and the Tigers couldn't get closer than seven points again.Now, after beating North Carolina State and third-seeded Baylor in Denver last weekend, drawing confidence from not needing oxygen masks like their opponents, Creighton has a chance at a program-changing victory.“At the end of the day, there’s just eight teams left, and to be one of those eight teams is just crazy,"" Kalkbrenner said. “It’s what you work for all year. It’s what you work for since you get here on campus in the summer, and this is all the hard work paying off now.”BIG PICTUREPrinceton: The Tigers didn't make it to Houston but they were among the many lower-seeded standouts during this delightfully unpredictable tournament.Creighton: The Bluejays' quick-hitting offense remains their signature. But over McDermott's 13 seasons, they've developed a stronger interior presence — and a defense that makes opponents uncomfortable.CASHING INThe tourney run could prove advantageous to Evbuomwan's bank account.“There's been some stuff,” he said when asked if he'd been approached with any NIL deals this month. “It's a fun part of the game now.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/25,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846387,Tatum: Celtics need Brown to be 'best version of ourselves',"BOSTON (AP) — The Boston Celtics have operated at their best when All-Stars Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown are both being playing their best basketball at the same time.Whether that partnership can endure long enough for them to lead the franchise to an 18th NBA title has been the persistent question surrounding the Celtics each of the past two seasons as rumors have swirled about Boston’s willingness to possibly trade Brown for more high-profile stars.It included this past offseason when reports surfaced about possible trade discussions between Boston and Brooklyn after Kevin Durant levied a trade request.Brown has been consistent in saying he has not let any of the rumors be a distraction for him on the court, as evidenced him averaging career highs in points (26.7) and rebounds this season. He had 27 points and seven rebounds in the Celtics’ 120-95 win over the Indiana Pacers on Friday night, helping Boston stay in the hunt to catch Milwaukee for the top seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs.But he also acknowledged in a recent interview with The Ringer that he was bothered enough by the most recent Durant trade chatter that he was compelled to reach out to both Tatum and president of basketball operations Brad Stevens in a conference call.Tatum confirmed that detail after Friday’s win, saying that he and Stevens let Brown know in that call that he was a valued member of the organization.“Just reassuring the obvious — that we need him,” Tatum said. “He’s a big part of this team, this franchise. Without him, we can’t reach our goal. You guys know that. The world knows that. The team knows that.

And sometimes things get taken out of context and gets lost in translation. I mean, those things happen.“But I pick and choose my spots.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846388,Renamed Horseshoe to host Poker World Series on Vegas Strip,"LAS VEGAS (AP) — A name paired with poker and Las Vegas lore now has a place on the neon-lit Strip following the rebranding of an iconic hotel with a memorable history at a crossroads shared with some of the most recognizable casinos in the world.The Horseshoe Las Vegas Hotel & Casino and its corporate owner, Caesars Entertainment Corp., hosted ceremonies Friday to mark the name change from Bally’s Las Vegas, before it again hosts the upcoming 54th annual World Series of Poker.“Not only are we excited for guests to experience the redesigned resort and its latest offerings, but we are also proud to reintroduce the historic gaming brand to Las Vegas,"" Jason Gregorec, Horseshoe senior vice president and general manager, said in a statement.The 2,800-room property once was the MGM Grand Hotel, where a historic fire in 1980 killed 87 people. It was Bally's Las Vegas for 36 years.Renovations and renaming harken back to Binion’s Horseshoe, a hotel and gambling hall in downtown's “Glitter Gulch” where the World Series of Poker began.It also puts the Horseshoe marquee across the street from the Bellagio and its fountains, Caesars Palace and its statues and the glittery Flamingo Las Vegas.Jack Binion, 86, a former casino executive and member of the American Gaming Association and World Series of Poker halls of fame, was set to present a lucky horseshoe from his family’s ranch at an event also including “Jubilee!” costumes recalling the feathery Bally’s revue that ran for 35 years before closing in 2016.The first World Series of Poker in 1970 was hosted by Binion’s father, former Texas gambler Benny Binion, as an invitation-only game at his downtown Horseshoe, a 366-room hotel he opened in 1951.Jack Binion and his brother, Ted Binion, worked at the downtown property, now known as Binion’s Gambling Hall & Hotel and operated by the corporate owner of the neighboring Four Queens. Ted Binion's death in 1998 sparked a sensational murder trial and eventual acquittal in 2004 of his ex-stripper, live-in girlfriend and her secret lover.Harrah's Entertainment acquired the poker tournament in 2004 and moved it to the Rio All-Suites Hotel & Casino. A year later, Harrah's bought Caesars Entertainment, which was purchased in 2020 by Eldorado Resorts, now called Caesars Entertainment Corp. Bally's hotel-casino was part of that deal. The renaming began last year.The tournament that made championship bracelets and Texas Hold 'em famous now runs for more than seven weeks. It drew nearly 200,000 players last year to Bally's and the adjacent Paris Las Vegas and awarded almost $350 million in prizes. It is scheduled to start this year on May 30.After it ends in July, officials said an 18-table poker room will offer tournament-style play year-round.The 26-story hotel now named Horseshoe opened in late 1973 as the MGM Grand. It had 2,100 rooms and was one of the largest hotels in the world.The deadly fire seven years later was one of the worst in U.S. history. It led to laws requiring fire safety and sprinkler systems in hotels and high-rises. The hotel was rebuilt and a second tower, adding 700 rooms, was completed in 1981.Bally Manufacturing bought the property in 1986. MGM Grand Inc. moved a block down the Strip and opened the movie-themed MGM Grand Las Vegas resort in late 1993. That 30-floor property, with more than 5,000 rooms and emerald green exterior, opened as the largest hotel complex in the world.The Bally's name is still expected to remain on the Las Vegas Strip at the aging, nearly 1,500-room Tropicana resort, now owned by Rhode Island-based Bally’s Corp.",2023/03/25,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846389,Greene's DC jail visit pulls GOP closer to Jan. 6 rioters,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene swept into the District of Columbia jail to check on conditions for the Jan. 6 defendants, with Republican lawmakers handshaking and high-fiving the prisoners, who chanted “Let's Go Brandon!” — a coded vulgarity against President Joe Biden — as the group left.A day earlier Speaker Kevin McCarthy met with the mother of slain rioter Ashli Babbitt, an Air Force veteran who was shot and killed by police as she tried to climb through a broken window during the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.And the House Republican leader recently gave Fox News’ Tucker Carlson exclusive access to a trove of Jan. 6 surveillance tapes despite the conservative commentator’s airing of conspiracy theories about the Capitol attack.Taken together, the House Republicans can be seen as working steadily but intently to distort the facts of the deadly riot, which played out for the world to see when Donald Trump's supporters laid siege to the Capitol, and in the process downplay the risk of domestic extremism in the U.S.In actions and legislation, the Republicans are seeking to portray perpetrators of the Capitol riot as victims of zealous federal prosecutors, despite many being convicted of serious crimes. As Trump calls for the Jan. 6 defendants to be pardoned, some House Republicans are attempting to rebrand those who stormed the Capitol as “political prisoners.”The result is alarming to those who recognize a dangerously Orwellian attempt to whitewash recent history.“There's no question Marjorie Taylor Greene and other Republicans are attempting to rewrite history,” said Heidi Beirich, the co-founder of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism. “They're making light of what was a serious attack on our democracy.”The tour Greene led at the local jail Friday comes as nearly 1,000 people have been charged by the Justice Department in the attack on the Capitol — leaders of the extremist Oath Keepers convicted of seditious conspiracy. The 20 or so defendants being held at the jail, many in pretrial detention on serious federal charges, are among those who battled police at the Capitol, officials said, in what at times was a gruesome bloody scene of violence and mayhem.Greene told The Associated Press the idea she’s trying to rewrite history is the “stupidest thing” she’s ever heard of, especially since the assault on the Capitol has been captured in the 41,000 hours of video that McCarthy made available to Fox News.“We can’t rewrite it — it’s all on video,” Greene told the AP.“You can’t change the history, but what we can do is expose the truth. That’s what we need to do,” Greene said.The country has been here before — in the aftermath of the Civil War, when the Lost Cause movement sought to reframe the battle over ending slavery in the U.S. as one of states’ rights, and again in the years following the Civil Rights movement as critics of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. questioned his transformative legacy.In the House under Republican control this year, the new leadership openly questions what happened on Jan. 6 as well as how the federal government is investigating and prosecuting extremists. Outside groups are raising money and rallying to the aid of Jan. 6 defendants.This past week, a Republican-led Judiciary subcommittee probed the federal government's treatment of parents protesting school board policies — sometimes violently — as unfair. Next week, the new Republican committee on the “weaponization"" of the federal government will delve into First Amendment free speech rights on social media.McCarthy warned that the federal government is labeling parents as “domestic terrorists” for showing up at school board meetings, even though such prosecutions are extremely rare.His was a reference to a 2021 Justice Department memo from Attorney General Merrick Garland responding to the National School Board Association's concerns about violent protesters at school board meetings. Garland had directed federal law enforcement to address what he called a “disturbing spike” in harassment of school officials.Probing the matter, the Republican-led House Judiciary Committee released a report showing that in one federal investigation, the FBI interviewed a mom for allegedly telling a local school board “we are coming for you.” In another, the FBI investigated a dad who opposed COVID mask mandates after a tipster to a federal hotline said he ""fit the profile of an insurrectionist” because he “rails against the government” and “has a lot of guns and threatens to use them.”“Parents should have a right to go to school board meetings and not be called terrorists,” McCarthy said.While Greene has said the Capitol attack was wrong, at the jail visit Friday she said she believes there’s a ""two-tiered” justice system and that the Jan. 6 defendants are being “treated as political prisoners” for their beliefs.Democrats on the tour said that is categorically false. While the local jail came has long been the subject of complaints — the U.S. Marshals made plans to relocate 400 detainees after a surprise 2021 inspection found parts of the facility “do not meet the minimum standards” — the Jan. 6 defendants have been housed in a newer wing that was not cited as problematic in the Marshals' statement.The two Democrats who joined the tour as members of the House Oversight Committee said they both had visited detention facilities before. “It's probably as good as a jail can be,” said Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, a former public defender.Democratic Rep. Robert Garcia of California noted the way the Republicans led by Greene treated the Jan. 6 defendants as celebrities — shaking their hands and slapping backs when the lawmakers arrived in the jail facility.As they left, the defendants chanted the “Let's Go Brandon!” phrase against Biden, he said in a tweet.“What is most important to remember is that while Marjorie Taylor Greene and others want to treat these folks as pseudo celebrities, some of these folks are insurrectionists,” Garcia told reporters. “And we can't forget that.”___This story has been corrected to reflect that Ashli Babbitt was an Air Force veteran, not a Navy veteran.",2023/03/26,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846411,20 tourists stranded on Taiwan's drought-stricken Sun Moon Lake,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — More than 20 foreign tourists were stranded on Sun Moon Lake Friday (March 24) after their charter boat ran aground due to drought causing reduced water levels.After receiving an alert, the fire department dispatched a water rescue boat to retrieve the passengers. It took about 10 trips to get the travelers to safety.The drought situation in central and southern Taiwan continues to worsen. According to the Central Region Water Resources Office of the Water Resources Agency, Sun Moon Lake's water level dropped to 741.55 meters on Saturday (March 25), almost 7 m below its high water mark of 748.48 m, now at 58.93% of capacity.Firefighters were cited by ETtoday as saying the incident happened at about 5 p.m. on Friday. The yacht was carrying more than 20 tourists and is believed to have come close to the ""Nine Frog Acrobats"" statue (九蛙疊像) when it ran aground.After receiving a distress call, the Nantou County Fire Department dispatched two firefighters in an inflatable rescue boat. Fearful the rescue craft might also run aground, they only allowed small groups of passengers each time. It took 10 trips to transfer all the stranded tourists to another boat, but there were no injuries reported.Authorities did not rule out the possibility that the charter boat may have taken passengers to the location upon request. The Sun Moon Lake National Scenic Area Administration said on Friday that charter boat companies only sail their vessels on major navigation routes to avoid similar incidents.It said that it would dispatch personnel to the location where the stranding occurred on Saturday (March 25), assess the cause of the incident, and advise boat operators to avoid the area for the time being.The area has seen significantly less rainfall this winter than last year. In June 2022, the water level only slightly exposed the second frog on the statue, but now the entire statue is exposed, and the lake bed it lies on has become dry and cracked.",2023/03/25,4508,Society

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846428,Bolsonaro's legal woes deepen with undeclared diamond gifts,"RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Undeclared diamond jewelry brought into Brazil from Saudi Arabia has deepened the legal jeopardy of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. An investigation into two sets of jewels reportedly worth millions is only the latest scandal threatening the far-right politician. But an extensive paper trail and even videos could make the case particularly daunting for Bolsonaro.WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE DIAMONDS?Federal police and prosecutors are investigating whether Bolsonaro tried to sneak two sets of expensive diamond jewelry into Brazil without paying taxes — and whether he improperly sought to prevent the items from being incorporated into the presidency’s public collection. Authorities are also looking into whether he enlisted public officials to try to bypass customs.The first set of jewels, composed of earrings, a necklace, a ring and a watch by Swiss brand Chopard, arrived in Brazil in October 2021 through Sao Paulo’s international airport with an adviser to the then minister for mines and energy, Bento Albuquerque, according to the newspaper O Estado de S.Paulo, which first reported the case in early March.Customs authorities seized the jewels, which are reportedly worth $3 million. A video released by television network Globo shows Albuquerque at customs later the same day stating that the jewels were for Bolsonaro’s wife, Michelle.A second set of jewels, also made by Chopard and including a watch, a pen, a ring, cuff links and a piece resembling a rosary, slipped past authorities and ended up in Bolsonaro’s possession. The watch is worth about $150,000, the newspaper Folha de S.Paulo reported.A government watchdog on March 22 ordered Bolsonaro to turn the jewelry over to the state-owned Caixa Economica Federal bank, as well as firearms he received as a gift from authorities in the United Arab Emirates. Bolsonaro's representatives did so on Friday.Brazil requires its citizens arriving by plane from abroad to declare goods worth more than $1,000 and, for any amount above that exemption, pay a tax equal to 50% of their value. The two sets of jewelry would have been exempt from tax had they been a gift from the state of Saudi Arabia to the nation of Brazil, but would not have been Bolsonaro's to keep.Bruno Dantas, a member of Brazil’s government watchdog, said a president could receive a gift for personal use without paying taxes as long as it was of low value, such as a T-shirt of a country’s national football team. Expensive jewelry does not meet the criteria, he said.The watchdog said it will audit all gifts received by Brazil’s presidency during Bolsonaro’s term.WHAT DID BOLSONARO DO ABOUT THE CONFISCATED JEWELS?Documents and video footage appear to show Bolsonaro making multiple unsuccessful attempts to retrieve the seized jewelry.A letter from the presidential office was sent to Albuquerque requesting that the jewels be released, O Estado de S.Paulo reported. The ministries of foreign affairs and mines and energy also sent letters pressuring customs authorities. Then Bolsonaro sent a personal letter to customs, O Estado de S.Paulo said.A last attempt came in the closing days of Bolsonaro's presidency. According to a document viewed by O Estado de S.Paulo, on Bolsonaro's orders a sergeant took a military plane to Sao Paulo’s airport in a failed effort to force the release. Globo released a video of the sergeant speaking with custom authorities.WHAT LEGAL ISSUES HAS THE CASE RAISED?The Senate’s transparency commission is investigating whether the sale of a refinery by Brazil's state-controlled oil giant Petrobras to the United Arab Emirates’ Mubadala Capital was related to the jewels. Mubadala didn't respond to a request for comment sent Friday.Petrobras completed the sale for $1.65 billion one month after the first set of jewels was seized in Sao Paulo. The price was “way below” fair market value, an oil workers’ union said in a recent statement.Rodrigo Sánchez Rios, a law professor at Pontifical Catholic University in the city of Curitiba, said Bolsonaro could potentially face trial on several counts, including influence peddling, embezzlement, money laundering and corruption.“This is potentially the crime with the most evidence currently implicating Bolsonaro,” said legal expert Wallace Corbo from the Getulio Vargas Foundation, a think tank and university.WHAT HAS BOLSONARO SAID ABOUT THE JEWELRY?“There was no intention on our part to disappear with this material,” Bolsonaro told television network Record on Wednesday during an event in Florida. He previously told CNN Brasil that he neither asked for nor received the confiscated jewelry.Bolsonaro’s attorney Frederick Wassef said in a statement on March 7 that the former president “officially declared personal property received on trips,” and is the target of political persecution.WHAT ARE BOLSONARO’S OTHER LEGAL PROBLEMS?The former president has denied any wrongdoing in all of the various cases under investigation, most recently whether he incited the Jan. 8 riots in which his supporters ransacked the Supreme Court, the presidential palace and Congress one week after leftist Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva was inaugurated as president.Bolsonaro is the subject of a dozen investigations by Brazil’s electoral court into his actions during the presidential election campaign, particularly related to his unsubstantiated claims that Brazil’s electronic voting system is susceptible to fraud. If Bolsonaro were found guilty in any of those cases, he would lose his political rights and be unable to run for office in the next election.Separately, Bolsonaro and his allies are also under investigation in a sprawling Supreme Court-led investigation on the spread of alleged falsehoods and disinformation in Brazil.Federal police are also investigating Bolsonaro and his administration for alleged genocide of the Indigenous Yanomami people in the Amazon rainforest by encouraging illegal miners to invade their territory and thereby endangering their lives. He has called the accusation a “hoax from the left.”——-Savarese reported from Sao Paulo.",2023/03/25,,World

They were playing without DeMar DeRozan because of a right quadriceps strain.“I think guys were aggressive. I definitely tried to be aggressive from the beginning, trying to set the tone, and then react from there,” LaVine said. “We settled into the game, the ball is moving around, we're getting a lot more open shots, and I think that leads to a lot more 3s.”Portland, which has lost seven of its last eight games, was led by rookie Shaedon Sharpe, who matched his career high with 24 points. The Blazers' lone win during the recent stretch came against the Utah Jazz 127-115 on Wednesday. Portland was at 13th in the Western Conference standings, well out of the playoff picture.Regular Portland starters Damian Lillard (calf tightness), Jusuf Nurkic (sore right knee), Jerami Grant (quad contusion) and Anfernee Simons (sore right foot) did not play against the Bulls. Instead, the Blazers started Ryan Arcidiacono, Matisse Thybulle, Trendon Watford, Drew Eubanks and Sharpe.“I thought offensively he was pretty good, defensively he wasn't bad, but tough matchup for him,” Blazers coach Chauncey Billups said about Sharpe. “That's the reason I wanted to put him on Zach, he needs to see what it's like in the fire. Zach is a tough matchup for anybody.”DeRozan aggravated his injury in the third quarter of Chicago's loss to Philadelphia on Wednesday. He missed five games in January and February because of the injury.“It's not at a point where he can't do anything, he's just trying to work through it right now and just manage it,” Bulls coach Billy Donovan said.Even without DeRozan, Chicago led by as many as 30 points.The Bulls went on a 9-0 run to start the second quarter to go up 35-26. LaVine capped the first half with a 3-pointer to put Chicago up 61-45.The Bulls pushed the lead to 70-49 in the third quarter. LaVine was pulled at the start of the third quarter and didn't return.“It was great. A little bit extra rest, those guys were out there playing great, I didn't have any worries about it,” LaVine said. “So I'm glad that Billy trusts them to go out there and finish the game off, and that's what we needed.”TIP INSBulls: Chicago won the first game between the two teams, 129-121, last month. ... Bulls assistant Maurice Cheeks was Portland's coach from 2001-05. ... Alex Caruso started after missing the last two games with left foot soreness.Trail Blazers: It was the first of a five-game homestand for the Blazers, who also have nine games left in the season. ... Billups finds himself in the same position he was last season, juggling lineups and absences as the playoffs appear out of reach. “Unfortunately it is familiar. It's not the best, it's not the greatest, but it is what it is. Whoever is available, I'm going to coach them, I'm going to do the best I I can to help them, to help them to help us,” Billups said.UP NEXTBulls: Visit the Los Angeles Lakers on Sunday.Trail Blazers: Host the Oklahoma City Thunder on Sunday.___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/25,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846430,"Trump, facing potential indictment, holds defiant Waco rally","WACO, Texas (AP) — Facing a potential indictment, Donald Trump took a defiant stance at a rally Saturday in Waco, disparaging the prosecutors investigating him and predicting his vindication as he rallied supporters in a city made famous by deadly resistance against law enforcement.With a hand over his heart, Trump stood at attention when his rally opened with a song called “Justice for All” performed by a choir of people imprisoned for their roles in the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. Some footage from the insurrection was shown on big screens displayed at the rally site as the choir sang the national anthem and a recording played of Trump reciting the Pledge of Allegiance.The extraordinary display opened Trump’s first rally of his 2024 Republican presidential campaign. He then launched into a speech brimming with resentments and framed the probes, including a New York grand jury investigation, as political attacks on him and his followers.“You will be vindicated and proud,” Trump said “The thugs and criminals who are corrupting our justice system will be defeated, discredited and totally disgraced.”Trump's event at the airport grounds in Waco was part of a broader effort by the former president to use the potential indictment as a rallying cry for supporters to maintain his status as the GOP frontrunner in what is expected to be a crowded primary. It came one day after Trump raised the specter of violence should he become the first former president in U.S. history to face criminal charges.Trump declared his innocence in the Manhattan investigation into a hush money payment made during the 2016 election to porn actor Stormy Daniels to keep her from going public about a sexual encounter she said she had with Trump years earlier. A grand jury hearing the case is expected to meet again on Monday.Trump said the Manhattan district attorney was investigating him ""for something that is not a crime, not a misdemeanor, not an affair.”Some of Trump's recent rhetoric, including at the rally, has echoed language he used before the Capitol insurrection by a mob of his supporters seeking to stop the transfer of power to Democrat Joe Biden, who won the presidential election.Trump declared Saturday that his “enemies are desperate to stop us"" and that “our opponents have done everything they can to crush our spirit and to break our will.""He added: “But they failed. They’ve only made us stronger. And 2024 is the final battle, it’s going to be the big one. You put me back in the White House, their reign will be over and America will be a free nation once again.""Trump could be indicted soon by a Manhattan grand jury investigating a $130,000 payment that Trump’s longtime lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen, made as Trump was in the throes of his 2016 presidential campaign.Trump later reimbursed Cohen and his company logged the reimbursements as a legal expense. Cohen has already served time in prison after pleading guilty to campaign finance charges and lying to Congress, among other crimes.Trump's eyebrow-raising choice of venue in Waco for his first rally came amid the 30th anniversary of a 51-day standoff and deadly siege between U.S. law enforcement and the Branch Davidians that resulted in the deaths of more than 80 members of the religious cult and four federal agents and has become a touchstone for far-right extremists and militia groups.Trump’s campaign insisted the location and timing of the event had nothing to do with the Waco siege or anniversary. A spokesperson said the site, 17 miles from the Branch Davidian compound, was chosen because it was conveniently situated near four of the state’s biggest metropolitan areas — Dallas/Fort Worth, Houston, Austin and San Antonio — and has the infrastructure to handle a sizable crowd.Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said before Trump’s arrival that he was the one who had suggested Waco as the venue. Any suggestion Trump had picked the city because of the anniversary was ""fake news. I picked Waco!” he told the crowd.Trump did not make any direct references in his speech to Waco's history, telling the crowd of thousands that he told Patrick he wanted to hold his rally in a place with overwhelming support, not “one of those 50-50 areas,"" and said he told Patrick, “Let’s go right into the heart of it.""At several points, Trump criticized Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is expected to run for president and is seen as his strongest potential challenger for the GOP nomination. Trump called his onetime ally disloyal and said he was “dropping like a rock.”Audience members were holding red and white signs handed out by the campaign that said “Witch Hunt,"" “Trump 2024” and “I stand with Trump.”Hours before Trump arrived, hundreds of his supporters began streaming into the airport past vendors selling merchandise including Trump flags, bumper stickers and action figures.Among them was Eugene Torres, 41, who said he was unfazed by the prospect that Trump could be indicted.“It’s just another political attack on him to keep him from running and winning this race again,” said Torres, who is from the Texas coast city of Corpus Christi.Alan Kregel, 56, traveled with his wife from Dallas to see Trump in person for the first time. While he voted for Trump in 2016 and 2020, he said he felt the former president's ""methods and vocabulary"" often detracted from his policies. But now, two years out of office, he said he is more supportive of Trump than he was before.“He’s an innocent man, just persecuted,"" said Kregel, arguing an indictment would help Trump win in 2024.Trump has spent weeks now railing against the New York probe and in a post on his social media site on Friday warned of “potential death & destruction in such a false charge"" if he’s charged with a crime.In a move that seemed designed to preempt a formal announcement, he claimed last Saturday that he would be arrested the following Tuesday. While that did not happen, Trump has used the days since to try to shape public perception — echoing a strategy he has used before, including during special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation.Trump has also repeatedly invoked violence, urging his supporters to protest, and used increasingly racist and dehumanizing rhetoric as he has launched ever more personal attacks against Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg.On Friday, a powdery substance was found with a threatening letter in a mailroom at Bragg's offices, authorities said. Officials later determined the substance wasn't dangerous.Even before the threatening letter was sent to Bragg's office, Democrats warned that Trump's remarks had the potential to incite violence.“The twice-impeached former president’s rhetoric is reckless, reprehensible and irresponsible. It’s dangerous, and if he keeps it up he’s going to get someone killed,” House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York said.In addition to the Manhattan case, Trump is also facing an investigation in Georgia over his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election as well as federal investigations into his handling of classified documents and possible obstruction, as well as his efforts on Jan. 6.___Price reported from New York.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846431,Bank failures and rescue test Yellen's decades of experience,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Working against the clock to stop a developing banking crisis, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen had until sunset on Sunday, March 12, to come up with a plan to calm the U.S. economy.She quickly turned to someone who had been through the fire before, and on a much larger scale: Hank Paulson.Paulson, who ran the Treasury Department during the financial crisis in 2008, counseled immediate government action. “It’s really hard to stop or even slow down a bank run. And to do that requires a powerful and quick government response,” Paulson said, recounting what he told Yellen.A bank run on Silicon Valley Bank had begun earlier in the week. Regulators took it over by that Friday afternoon. The move panicked shareholders and depositors, stirring stark reminders of earlier failures that triggered the Great Recession.Perhaps no treasury secretary has come to the office with Yellen's ample resume, including service as the chair of the Federal Reserve and a lifetime of studying economics and finance. That experience was put to a severe test as she worked to assure multiple constituencies, including financial markets, balky Republicans in Congress and President Joe Biden's White House economic team.Yellen spent that crucial period two weeks ago assembling Federal Reserve officials; regulators at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency; lawmakers, including congressional leaders on banking — Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, and Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C.; and Wall Street executives such as Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of J.P. Morgan & Chase.But few could relate as well as Paulson, who had asked Congress for authority to buy up $700 billion in distressed mortgage-related assets from private firms to save the larger U.S. financial system.His words to Yellen as she navigated the bank collapses: “We are fighting for the survival of our regional banks.""The Fed defines regional banks as those with total assets between $10 billion to $100 billion, not as small as community banks and not as large as national ones. Regional and community banking organizations constitute the largest number of banking institutions supervised by the Federal Reserve.The crisis became apparent on Wednesday, March 8. Silicon Valley Bank's chief executive officer, Greg Becker had sent a letter to shareholders stating that the bank would need to raise $2.25 billion to shore up its finances after suffering significant losses.The bank held an unusually high level of uninsured deposits, and many investments in long-term government bonds and mortgage-backed securities had tumbled in value as interest rates rose. That caused depositors on Thursday, March 9, to rush to withdraw their funds en masse. It triggered a bank run.On the next afternoon, Yellen spoke with Fed Chair Jerome Powell, FDIC head Martin Gruenberg, acting head of the OCC Michael Hsu and San Francisco Fed chair Mary Daly. Regulators rushed to place Silicon Valley Bank into FDIC receivership.That weekend, staff from Treasury, the Fed, and FDIC began the search for a potential buyer for the bank. Yellen and other federal officials met to ensure the bank could make payroll by the coming Monday, and that no taxpayer money would be used to fund the rescue. And do it all before Asian markets opened for the week.Yellen also had to assuage Republicans in Congress. She talked with McHenry and other lawmakers who wanted to know whether the actions would lead to more regulation. McHenry did not respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press, but said at an American Bankers Association event this past week that he supported the government’s decision to make depositors whole.By Sunday evening, March 12, the Treasury, the Federal Reserve, and FDIC sent a joint statement announcing that New York-based Signature Bank had also failed and was being seized. Officials also said that an emergency lending package would ensure that all depositors at Silicon Valley Bank and New York-based Signature Bank would be protected.In a matter of days, a third bank, First Republic was fortified by $30 billion from 11 big banks to prevent more regional institutions from collapsing.Yellen came up with the idea of using bank funds to save First Republic and first raised it with Powell, Gruenberg and other regulators. Then she had a call with Dimon and broached the idea. After that call, Dimon reportedly said “we have our marching orders” and proceeded to build a coalition of banks, according to two people briefed on the matter, speaking anonymously because they were not authorized to discuss details of a private conversation.A representative from Dimon's office did not respond to a request for comment.This account of Yellen’s actions during that weekend is based on more than a dozen interviews.A former Federal Reserve governor, Sarah Bloom Raskin, said Yellen and other policymakers will now have to determine “how two banks that many didn’t think would pose a systemic risk to the banking system"" could so threaten the nation's financial health.A year ago, she withdrew her name as a Fed governor nominee after not receiving enough Senate support. She had previously served from 2010 to 2016 and took her oath of office at the same time as Yellen, a vice chair at the time.Brown, who urged President Barack Obama to nominate Yellen to succeed Ben Bernanke as Fed chair, said people “realize how competent she is and in how she’s charged with doing big things in the administration.”Now, Yellen has to respond to accusations that the Biden administration is bailing out risky banks. Some Republicans have put the blame on Biden administration spending, which they say triggered 40-year high inflation, forcing the the Fed to raise interest rates to tame prices, in turn impacting banks and their investments.Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., said at an American Bankers Association event last week that “when you go to a 40-year high level of inflation, the truth of the matter when inflation is that high, you should immediately go into action, the Fed doesn't have a scalpel, it has a hammer and it hurts.”Biden has since called on Congress to strengthen the rules for banks to prevent future failures and to allow regulators to impose tougher penalties on the executives of failed banks, including clawing back compensation and making it easier to bar them from working in the industry.Paulson said “we’re really fortunate to have a smart, experienced treasury secretary,” describing Yellen as “one who reaches out to gets a range of opinions and talks to market participants on a real time basis.”But her test is not over.She held a meeting Friday of the Financial Stability Oversight Council — the meeting had been called earlier in the week— and discussed, in part, the developments at Deutsche Bank, the German multinational investment bank whose stock was tumbling.",2023/03/26,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846432,Texas blows out Xavier 83-71 for spot in NCAA Elite Eight,"KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — Rodney Terry stopped on the way to the Texas locker room after his team knocked out Xavier for a spot in the Elite Eight, the interim coach fulfilling a fan's wish for a photograph by flashing that all-too-familiar “Hook ’em Horns” sign.“Go get that job, coach!” the grateful fan hollered after him.A couple more wins and the folks at Texas might not have a choice.The longtime assistant made his boldest statement yet for the full-time gig, guiding the Longhorns without ailing big man Dylan Disu to an 83-71 win over the Musketeers on Friday night. Tyrese Hunter scored 19 points, and Marcus Carr and Christian Bishop added 18 apiece, to move second-seeded Texas within a game of the Final Four for the first time in 15 years.“I thought we played one of our better defensive games tonight that we played all year,” said Terry, who stepped into the top job in December, when Chris Beard was suspended and ultimately fired following allegations of domestic violence.“Proud of my guys and the way they put their will on this game from the start to finish.”Disu, who had been dominant through the first two games of the tournament, hurt his foot in a second-round win over Penn State. He got treatment on it all week, and the Longhorns successfully kept it secret until tipoff, when the big man played just a couple of minutes and then limped off the floor and straight to the locker room.When he returned to the bench, he was wearing a big walking boot, a black hoodie and a grim expression.“It'll be day-to-day right now at the moment,” Terry said. “We got the best in the business working with us.”Still, the Longhorns already had a tough task ahead in No. 5 seed Miami on Sunday night, especially given the way the Hurricanes roared to an 89-75 win over Houston. The possibility of playing without Disu, who led the Longhorns to a Big 12 Tournament title and earned MVP honors on the same floor just two weeks ago, only makes it harder.“We knew before the game that we wouldn't have Dylan for the whole game,” Carr said. “We just wanted to really play for him. We knew how much this would mean to him. We got emotional in there knowing he wouldn't be out there.”Relegated to a 6-foot-9 cheerleader Friday night, Disu at least had plenty to celebrate.Sir'Jabari Rice scored 16 points and Timmy Allen added 11 for the Longhorns (29-8). The best-seeded team left in the tournament kept Souley Boum and Xavier's perimeter threats in check while making life miserable for Jack Nunge down low.Adam Kunkel hit five 3-pointers and led the third-seeded Musketeers (27-10) with 21 points. Nunge scored 15 but needed 19 shots to get there, while Colby Jones also had 15 points. Boum didn’t hit a field goal until early in the second half and finished with 12.“They were better than us,” Xavier coach Sean Miller said. “We had a very difficult time running our offense and that's a testament to their defense, because we've been able to score virtually every game we've played this year.”It was Texas that scored at will, though, and Carr that got them going. He spun through the lane like a Tilt-A-Whirl for tough buckets at the rim, and even knocked down a spinning, desperation 3 as the shot clock expired. And when Miller traded out a man-to-man defense for a zone, the Longhorns began to pound the ball to Bishop in the paint.With dozens of family and friends on hand, the Creighton transfer from the Kansas City suburb of Lee's Summit, Missouri, went to work. Bishop threw down one dunk on Carr's alley-oop lob, then slammed down another a few minutes later.By the time Allen banked in a half-court heave, the Longhorns had established a 42-25 halftime advantage — and had to be redirected from the Xavier tunnel, where they were busy celebrating, toward their own locker room.“Their pressure is something you can’t really simulate until you’re in the game against them. Their toughness, their experience,” Miller said. “And then offensively they have great guard play, and you feel that as well.”Xavier tried to creep back a couple of times, but the Longhorns never let their lead sniff single digits. And that gave Terry, who returned to Texas after head jobs at Fresno State and UTEP, a chance to breathe deeply and enjoy the moment.The 54-year-old from the small Texas town of Angleton was on Rick Barnes' staff the last time the Longhorns reached the Elite Eight, back in 2008. He was on the 2003 staff that guided them all the way to the Final Four, too.Now, he's one step away from taking Texas on a most improbable trip to college basketball's biggest stage.“Continue to want more. I mean, each round — don’t be satisfied,” Terry said. “We’re going to enjoy this victory for one night, like we have all year long, and we’ll be on to the next challenge and very quickly against a really good Miami team.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/25,,World

""I'm a very focused player, there were no distractions before the game. After the game, I kissed all the babies and hugged all the people. After business was done, I celebrated.”The Cardinals (26-11) will face second-seed Iowa on Sunday for a trip to the Final Four. The Hawkeyes beat Colorado 87-77, behind the play of Caitlin Clark.It's the fifth consecutive NCAA Tournament that Louisville has gotten this far, one of the few teams to accomplish the feat.“It’s hard to continue to get to where we are and win,” Louisville coach Jeff Walz said. ""You have to enjoy it. It’s too short not to enjoy these types of moments.”Expectations were high for the Cardinals under Walz to start the season as the team was ranked seventh in The Associated Press' preseason Top 25 poll. With many new players, the Cardinals lost four out of six games in late November and early December.Walz wasn't concerned. The team started to get more comfortable on the court and made a run to the finals of the ACC Tournament, where they lost to Virginia Tech.“We’ve been playing well for the last month and a half,"" Walz said. ""We’ll continue to roll and continue to play. We’re going to enjoy this tonight. I’m going to enjoy this. I’m going to the bar. Life’s too short.”On Friday, the Cardinals were met with a stiff challenge from upstart Mississippi.The Rebels (25-9) hadn't advanced this far since 2007, when the team made its fifth Elite Eight in program history. They were looking to become only the second No. 8 seed to reach a regional final, joining Southwest Missouri State, which did it in 1992.Mississippi's defense under coach Yolett McPhee-McCuin had been so good in the first two games of the tournament, keeping both Gonzaga and No. 1 seed Stanford under 50 points in each game.“The Sweet 16 is the new standard,” McPhee-McCuin said.Louisville reached that mark by the end of the third quarter on Merissah Russell's 3-pointer. That gave the Cardinals a 52-42 lead — their biggest of the game to that point. That 3 came shortly after Jones' three-point play extended a 46-40 lead to nine.The Cardinals played their own stout defense for the second game in a row. The Cardinals held host Texas to 51 points in the second round.Louisville got off to a slow start against Mississippi, but then Van Lith got them going and the Cardinals led 20-15 after one quarter. After a slow start to the second quarter that saw them give up the lead, the Cardinals still managed to hold a 34-29 advantage at the half.They couldn't separate themselves from the Rebels until the end of the quarter.Ole Miss cut its deficit to 58-53 with 2:32 left before Van Lith hit a shot in the lane to stem the Rebels' run. After Myah Taylor made the first of two free throws, Olivia Cochran had a three-point play with 2:17 left to make it 63-54 and pretty much seal the victory.“I didn’t feel like we had control of the game at any point. That’s different for my team,” McPhee-McCuin said. “The lights got bright. There were a lot of times I didn’t know who I was coaching. When do we give up 20 points in a quarter? That’s uncharacteristic.”Marquesha Davis and Taylor each scored 19 points to lead Ole Miss.HOMETOWN HEROAround these parts, Van Lith is a household name. She’s the small-town standout from 130 miles away who grew into being one of the best prep players in the country, the all-time state high school leader in scoring and now a star for the Cardinals.Many fans from her hometown of Cashmere that has a population of 3,200 took in the game, cheering the Louisville star on.

He was magnificent tonight.”Embiid checked back into the game with 8:26 left and scored 13 straight on the way to 46 points, but the Warriors came back from 11 down for their ninth straight home win — and one of the most important yet as they fight for playoff positioning.Green noted: “Nobody wants to be in that play-in, the play-in is dangerous.”Curry dribbled the baseline and around Embiid for a go-ahead jumper with 2:20 to play.

It’s that time of year you’ve got to turn everything up a notch,"" Green said. ""I love this time of year.""Philadelphia, which had won the last two matchups, made 10 of 17 shots to start the game but missed its first eight 3-point tries before Georges Niang connected at the 8:06 mark of the second quarter.GOLF OUTINGSixers coach Doc Rivers likes to get a round of golf in when visiting the Bay Area.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846435,Search on for missing in deadly chocolate factory explosion,"WEST READING, Pa. (AP) — An explosion at a chocolate factory in Pennsylvania on Friday killed three people and left four people missing, authorities said. One person was pulled alive from the rubble overnight.Rescue crews using dogs and imaging equipment continued to search through the rubble Saturday — hours after the blast that erupted just before 5 p.m. Friday at the R.M. Palmer Co. plant in the borough of West Reading, about 60 miles (96 kilometers) northwest of Philadelphia.West Reading Borough Chief of Police Wayne Holben said the death toll rose on Saturday with the discovery of a third body at the site. The Berks County Medical Examiner and Coroner on Saturday night also confirmed three fatalities.Borough Fire Chief Chad Moyer said four people remained missing as emergency personnel continue searching for victims and state and local fire investigators examine the scene to determine a cause.“Due to the violence of the explosion and the amount of time that has passed, the chance of finding survivors is decreasing rapidly,"" Moyer said. “However, please be assured that our primary goal is accounting for all missing individuals and reuniting them with their loved ones.”Holben earlier said the rescue of one person from the rubble “provides hope that others still may be found.” Rescue workers were continuing a thorough search using specialized equipment and techniques. Officials said dogs and imaging equipment were being used to look for signs of life during the careful removal of debris.The blast destroyed one building and damaged a neighboring building. Roadways near the site will be closed until Monday at 8 a.m., Holben said.“It’s pretty leveled,” Mayor Samantha Kaag said of the explosion site. “The building in the front, with the church and the apartments, the explosion was so big that it moved that building four feet forward.”Reading Hospital said Saturday afternoon it had received 10 patients, of which one was transferred to Lehigh Valley Hospital and another to Penn State Health St. Joseph Medical Center. Two were admitted to Reading Hospital in good and fair condition, respectively, and the others had been discharged, officials said.A UGI Utilities spokesperson said crews were brought in after damage from the blast led to the release of gas that was helping to feed the fire.“We did not receive any calls regarding a gas leak or gas order prior to the incident. But we are cooperating with the investigation and part of that will be to check all our facilities in the vicinity,” UGI spokesperson Joseph Swope said Saturday.R.M. Palmer said in a statement late Saturday that everyone at the company was “devastated by the tragic events” and “focused on supporting our employees and their families.”“We have lost close friends and colleagues, and our thoughts and prayers are with the families and friends of all who have been impacted,” the company said, expressing gratitude to the “extraordinary efforts” of first responders and the support of the Reading community, “which has been home to our business for more than 70 years.”R.M. Palmer said it was anxious to get in touch with its employees and their families. But its email, phones and other communication systems were down, and it was relying on first responders and disaster recovery organizations to provide information to affected families. The company said it would be “providing additional information and making contact with employees, impacted families, and the community as soon as possible.”Kaag said people were asked to move back about a block in each direction, but no evacuations were ordered. She had issued an emergency declaration only to allow more resources for first responders. Borough manager Dean Murray said some residents were displaced from the damaged apartment building.Gov. Josh Shapiro, who visited the site Saturday along with the emergency management agency director, vowed “any and all commonwealth resources needed to support ongoing recovery efforts –- in addition to the extensive assets that have already been deployed.”A team of structural engineers and K-9s from a state urban search and rescue task force had been assisting since last night, and additional personnel arrived Saturday, he said. A state police fire marshal was also assisting in the investigation, he said.Philip Wert, vice president of the West Reading council, said the building had been constructed in the late 1950s or early 1960s, and officials had to “access our archive to pull the blueprints last night, in order to get a better layout of the building and the mechanicals and the utilities, where things are.”“The silver lining in all this is someone was found alive, someone was found alive that was in rubble, not knowing whether they were going to live or die, and fortunately we found that person and they’ve got a second chance, and hopefully fingers crossed we’re going to find more,” he said.Frank Gonzalez stood on a hill overlooking the blast site, watching the rubble being cleared. He said his sister, Diana Cedeno, was working at the plant at the time of the blast and was among the missing.“It’s not good. It’s just stressful waiting, not knowing,” he said, expressing frustration at what he perceived as a lack of communication from authorities about the search. “We keep reaching out, bugging, keeping her name alive just in case she is in there and says her name.”He said his sister has two adult children, including a son who is deployed overseas. She has a side job decorating for parties and has also been studying for ministry at her church, he said.Gonzalez said his son and nephew had also worked at the plant, but that his son had quit a few months ago “because he said he didn’t like the smell of the gas that was in there.” His son and nephew had complained about the smell to plant supervisors, who told them, ""‘It’s all right. We got it. It’s being handled. Don’t worry about it,’” he said.Frank DeJesus said his stepdaughter, Arelis Rivera Santiago, a Palmer employee, was working in the building next door at the time of the blast. The ceiling caved, and she had to crawl under machinery to make it out, he said. DeJesus said he rushed to the scene to find her “shaking and crying hysterically,"" and she was still too shaken to speak about what had happened.Plant employees, including his stepdaughter, had complained about smelling gas throughout the day Friday, DeJesus said.“Everyone complained about smelling gas, and they kept making them work,” he said. “The supervisors told them it was nothing. It was being taken care of.”A message was sent earlier to R.M. Palmer seeking comment about the blast.Doug Olexy was home from work and checking email when the blast shook his house, rattling windows and making the walls vibrate.“It sounded like a bomb went off,” he recalled Saturday. “I mean, all of our houses shook. I’ve never heard as loud of an explosion in my life.”He and his neighbors ran out onto the street immediately afterward and were met by thick black smoke. At first, Olexy thought it was a train derailment because there are tracks nearby. Then he learned it was the Palmer plant, which he called a West Reading institution.“Everybody knows Palmer chocolate,” he said.R.M. Palmer's website says it has been making chocolate novelties since 1948 and now has 850 employees at its West Reading headquarters. Its Facebook page includes entries earlier this month advertising Easter treats such as chocolate bunnies and “the newest milk chocolate hollow"" in its “bunny family” as one with jelly beans inside.

We've got to .500, and now it's time to get on the other side.”With Davis leading the way on both ends of the court, Los Angeles (37-37) reached .500 for the first time this year.

All the things they got down the stretch are things we're willing to live with. It's hard to slow that down.”Russell sat out with a sore right hip, joining James on the sideline at an important game for the Lakers' playoff hopes. Los Angeles still improved to 8-5 during James' latest injury absence.Oklahoma City erased all of Los Angeles’ early 17-point lead when Gilgeous-Alexander’s jumper tied it at 102-102 with 5:25 to play. Davis responded with three points, and Walker hit a tiebreaking shot with 3:50 left.Schröder replaced Russell in the starting lineup and had another standout game, including six points in the final 3:18 while the Lakers hung on.

For comments on whether Honduras was about to break off diplomatic relations after more than 80 years, she referred to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.Fears about a break started March 14 when President Xiomara Castro tweeted she had told Foreign Minister Eduardo Enrique Reina to start talks with China on opening official relations. Before winning the presidential election last year, she had hinted at a break with Taipei.After Castro’s tweet, allegations hit the media about dollar diplomacy, expensive public works projects, demands for aid, and support for Castro’s family when her husband, Manuel Zelaya, was deposed as president in 2009.As Honduras decided to go ahead with sending Reina to Beijing, MOFA announced Thursday (March 23) it was recalling Chang to express its grave dissatisfaction.If the break goes ahead, Taiwan will be left with 13 official diplomatic allies, with Guatemala and Belize the only partners in Central America.

New Zealand supports political settlement of disputes through dialogue, she was quoted saying in the report.Wang said the pressing task is to achieve a ceasefire and resume peace talks, and that China would continue to play a constructive role to promote a political settlement, the agency added.During the meeting with Qin, Mahuta also raised concerns over the human rights situation in Xinjiang, the erosion of freedoms in Hong Kong, disputes in the South China Sea and increasing tensions in the Taiwan Strait, her press office said.The ministers discussed the possibility of New Zealand Prime Minister Chris Hipkins visiting China this year, the office added.China is New Zealand’s largest trading partner and New Zealand exporters rely on China to buy milk products and other agricultural goods.",2023/03/25,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846511,Taiwan’s Sandee Chan releases song sung by AI,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Golden Melody award winning musician Sandee Chan (陳珊妮) and the founder of Taiwan AI Labs, Ethan Tu (杜奕瑾) revealed this week that a song released under Chan’s name was actually sung by AI.The revelation at a press event on Wednesday (March 22) shocked the local music industry and sparked discussions on just how influential technology is in the arts today. The single was released March 14 and is called “Teach Me the Ways to Be Your Love.”It was composed by Chan and features lyrics by Chow Yiu-fai (周耀輝), one of Hong Kong's big three lyricists. The song draws inspiration from A.I.-related science fiction classics like ""Her"" and ""Blade Runner"" and uses ""I Learn to Love"" as a metaphor for the process of ""AI learning to sing,"" which is ultimately human-based.The song is accompanied by jazz pianist Martin ""Musa"" Musaubach, giving it a dramatic soundtrack style. In the occasionally pixellated but always moving video, Chan’s AI-generated voice is ever present, but Chan is not
shown singing.



The song was produced using Chan's past album sound files, combined with the work done by AI Labs personnel over one year. Chan then selected breaks and adjusted the Midi notes so the AI could fill in the lyrics.She tried to avoid using auto-tune or other software to achieve the simulation of a human voice, with all its beauty and imperfections. Every breath and harmony is sung by the A.I., and even the single cover picture was generated by AI.AI Labs founder (also originator of local bulletin board PTT) Ethan Tu, said there were no plans to launch commercial software for the project yet. However, an integrated audio-visual creation platform will be launched in the near future that can automatically generate music.Chan has been a singer for over 25 years and has won many awards, including for her 12th studio album ""Juvenile A"" in 2019. She also won Golden Melody Awards for Best Album and Best Album Producer in 2005, and Best Mandarin Female Singer in 2008.Cover art for Sandee Chan's single “Teach Me the Ways to Be Your Love.”",2023/03/25,652,Sports & Entertainment

Yui pointed out that China’s efforts were marked by broken promises linked to projects that include a canal between the Atlantic and the Pacific in Nicaragua, and airports and harbors in El Salvador.In contrast, Taiwan has recently become an important partner for Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Mexico in the fields of economy, culture, science and technology, Yui told the Spanish-language news service Tuesday (March 21).He said that if Taiwan wanted to open an embassy in Buenos Aires, it would not ask Argentina to end diplomatic relations with China, per UDN. The Latin American country could manage relations with both China and Taiwan simultaneously, Yui said.However, Beijing would not allow this, but instead it would try to isolate Taiwan. Each country needed to consider whether this kind of demand was just, Yui said in the interview.He pointed out how China’s efforts were failing, as more important government officials and lawmakers from many countries were standing up to Chinese protests and visiting Taiwan.The vice minister also underlined how the country stood as part of the first line of resistance against China’s authoritarian regime, with the war in Ukraine showing how it would not be easy for a larger country to invade and force the submission of a smaller democracy. He added that Taiwan would do its utmost to avoid a war, and called on other countries to help prevent a Chinese attack.",2023/03/25,1916,Politics
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846518,"Russia wants demilitarised buffer zones in Ukraine, says Putin ally","MOSCOW, March 24 (Reuters) - Russia wants to create demilitarised buffer zones inside Ukraine around areas it has annexed, an ally of President Vladimir Putin said on Friday, saying it might be necessary to push deeper into Ukraine if such zones cannot be set up.More than a year into Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Putin's core war aims remain unfulfilled despite Russian control of nearly a fifth of the country.Neither side shows any sign of laying down arms. Hundreds of thousands of Russian and Ukrainian soldiers have been killed or seriously wounded, according to Western military estimates.Former President Dmitry Medvedev, who casts himself as Putin's most publicly hawkish official, said Russia needed demilitarised corridors around the areas it is claiming - and which Ukraine says it will never accept Russian control of.""We need to achieve all the goals that have been set to protect our territories, that is the territories of the Russian Federation,"" Medvedev, who is deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council, said in an interview with Russian media posted on Telegram.We need to ""throw out all the foreigners who are there in the broad sense of the word, create a buffer zone which would not allow the use of any types of weapons that work at medium and short distances, that is 70-100 kilometres, to demilitarise it,"" Medvedev said.Russia would have to push further into Ukraine if such zones were not established, he said, taking Kyiv the capital or even the Western Ukrainian city of Lviv. Ukraine says it will never accept Russian occupation of its land.Russia currently controls around 17-18% of Ukraine, including a swathe of land in the east and along the Azov and Black Sea coastline as well as Crimea which Russia annexed in 2014.The grinding artillery war between two well-dug in and well-supplied armies has been costly for Russia and Ukraine, which is supported by the United States and major European powers.Russia insists it will achieve all of its war aims and has cautioned the West against testing its resolve. The West says that what CIA Director William Burns calls Putin's ""hubris"" will be pierced by battlefield defeat in Ukraine.""Nothing can be ruled out here. If you need to get to Kyiv, then you need to go to Kyiv, if you need to get to Lviv, then you need to go to Lviv in order to destroy this infection,"" said Medvedev.",2023/03/25,283,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846523,Fashion extinction? France's affordable brands in crisis,"The global fashion industry is grappling with a crisis fueled by high inflation and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. France's pret-a-porter sector is no exception.Even as French luxury labels such as Chanel and Louis Vuitton continue to churn out profits, many midrange brands have been forced to enter bankruptcy proceedings. Except for those with innovative approaches.Insolvent brands include shoemaker Andre and women's fashion labels Camaieu and Kookai.""Our company used to be incredibly successful and we had about 300 retailers in ten countries,""  Kookai's marketing director Jennifer Cohen Solal told DW.""But after the French group Vivarte bought the company in 1996, things started to go downhill — our clients gradually withdrew their love,"" she said.Vivarte downsized the company's business to three countries — France, Spain and Switzerland — and stopped investing in the remaining 120 stores.When Australia's Magi purchased the brand in 2017, one restructuring plan had already been implemented. A second one was to follow in 2021.""Our frail financial health was the reason why banks then rejected our two demands for government-backed emergency loans after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic,"" Cohen Solal recalled. Kookai entered insolvency proceedings in February this year.But Philippe Moati says today's high inflation and sinking purchasing power are just the final straw for many midrange pret-a-porter chains. He's a professor of economics at the Paris Cite University and founder of the Paris-based market research company ObSoCo.""France's midrange fashion labels have suffered from multiple crises,"" he told DW.""The monthslong yellow vest protests for more social justice from November 2018 meant many customers didn't feel like going shopping and more recently, weekslong lockdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic aggravated the chains' cash-flow problems,"" he said.""What's more, France has too much shop floor — the market is saturated — and since 2017, sales are allowed all year round, which has amplified competition,"" Moati noted.He added that websites selling secondhand clothes such as the Lithuanian platform Vinted were putting the sector under further pressure.And yet, France's midrange pret-a-porter sector did have a golden age, Gildas Minvielle, director of the Economic Observatory at Paris-based fashion school Institut Francais de la Mode, recalled.""These stores outpaced small boutiques in the 1980s and had a very successful period until 2010, even 2015,"" he told DW.But now, the sector is also having to cope with so-called fast fashion brands — extremely cheap and continuously updated clothes.""The Chinese company Shein is particularly tough competition — this pure player with only an online presence sells all sizes including very small and very big ones,"" Minvielle explained.Just like luxury brands, very cheap clothes remain popular. That particularly worries Minvielle.""Every purchase has an impact and young people should be aware of how polluting fast fashion is,"" he said.The fast fashion sector is sparking environmental and ethical concerns for using a high amount of resources and producing under dubious labor conditions.Since the beginning of the pandemic, which instituted working from home in the business world, people bother even less about what they wear, reckons Michel Resseguier, a fashion industry veteran.""In 2019, people were no longer sporting a tie at the office but still wearing a formal shirt — now, they are working from home in a t-shirt,"" he told DW.The expert says the trend towards more casual clothing at work started around the year 2000 when US technology giant Apple's Steve Jobs, who died from cancer in 2011, started addressing press conferences in sneakers and turtlenecks.""Brands in this segment need to accept that the overall market is shrinking,"" underlined Resseguier.But he also sees a silver lining — something he's trying to attain with the female fashion brand Paprika he's currently working with.""Brands can survive if they go back to their raison d'etre,"" he said. ""We are giving employees and local managers on the shop floor more power and responsibility as they understand the client's needs and know how to recreate a bond with them.""Some brands are performing well despite multiple crises — through innovative concepts, as Yann Rivoallan, head of the Paris-based Federation of Female Pret-a-Porter,  says.""Companies such as Loom or Bonne Guele are successful with their sustainably produced clothes,"" he told DW.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846524,Vatican returns Parthenon pieces to Greece Acropolis,"Greece on Friday welcomed the return of ancient artifacts from the Acropolis in Athens, given in what the Vatican City classified as an ""ecumenical donation"" after the three pieces were taken more than 200 years ago.Greek Culture Minister Lina Mendoni, visiting Catholic Bishop Brian Farrell, and the head of Greece's Orthodox Church, Archbishop Ieronymos II, led a ceremony for the repatriation of the three sculpture fragments at the Acropolis Museum.""The gifting of fragments of the Parthenon which had been held in the Vatican Museums for more than two centuries, shows itself as a cultural and social gesture of friendship and solidarity with the people of Greece,"" Bishop Brian Farrell, the Vatican's secretary for promoting Christian unity, said.""We assure you of our intimate joy at the realization of your legitimate wish to have the ... fragments at home in their place of origin,"" he added.The Vatican first announced its intentions late last year in a papal decree.The marble fragments include the head of a horse that was pulling the mythical goddess Athena's chariot, according to the Vatican Museums' website.It comes from the west front of the building and where Athena and Poseidon, the god of the sea, are depicted competing for control of the city.The second fragment depicts the head of a young male, believed to have originally been depicted carrying a tray of votive cakes offered during a procession to commemorate the founding of Athens.The third was the head of a bearded male from a part of the building whose sculptures depicted a battle between the mythical Lapith group of people and part-horse, part-man Centaurs.""Initiatives like these show the way, how the pieces of the Parthenon can be reunited, healing the wounds caused by barbaric hands so many years ago,"" Culture Minister Mendoni said, before moving on to Greece's efforts to recover the historic sculptures, from the British Museum in London in particular.""This takes us to the just and moral demand of the entire Greek people, and of this government and its prime minister, for the final return of all the sculptures of the Parthenon,"" she said.A museum in Sicily similarly returned a piece to Athens last year.Carved in the 5th century BC, the sculptures from the Parthenon were taken in the early 19th century by British diplomat Lord Elgin before Greece won independence from the Ottoman Empire.They are scattered around the world but many are at the British Museum.Britain had in the past argued that this was done with approval from the occupying Ottomans at the time and so was legally valid; Greece countered that the Ottomans were not entitled to grant any such permission.Comments in 2022 earlier this year, including from the British Museum's new chair, former Finance Minister George Osborne, suggesting a ""hybrid solution"" where ""the sculptures could be seen in both London and Athens."" That idea had prompted hope of possible movement in the dispute.However, neither the British nor the Greek governments have expressed much optimism publicly on the matter since.Mendoni on Friday said Greece would be willing to lend the British Museum ancient Greek artifacts to ""fill the gap"" if the so-called Elgin Marbles (as the musuem dubs its collection) were returned, with one legal sticking point a dispute over recognition either of ownership or exchange in any possible accord.""Greece cannot recognize possession and ownership by the British Museum because it considers the sculptures to be there as a product of theft,"" she said.The Vatican had circumvented the legal question of ownership by describing its gesture as an ""ecumenical donation"" to Greece and its Orthodox Church.msh/wd (AFP, AP)",2023/03/25,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846525,Ukraine's abducted children: 'The list of suspects will grow longer',"Since the start of the Kremlin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine,the Russian military has taken thousands of Ukrainian children to Russia. DW spoke with Daria Gerasymchuk, an advisor to the Ukrainian president's office, charged with protecting children's rights. She told DW about Russia's abduction tactics and how Ukraine is trying to get the children returned to Ukrainian territory that is under Kyiv's control.DW: The International Criminal Court (ICC) has issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian commissioner for children's rights, Maria Lvova-Belova, on allegations of having kidnapped Ukrainian children and taken them to Russia. Are these the only two responsible?Daria Gerasymchuk: Many people are involved, especially the representatives of local authorities in various Russian regions who have taken these children in. All video evidence left behind by representatives of the Russian authorities is being documented by Ukrainian state prosecutors and handed over to investigators from the ICC. So, I think the list of suspects will grow longer.The issuing of arrest warrants for Putin and Belova is historic and a first step toward recognizing the genocide of Ukrainian people by means of child abduction. According to the provisions in Article 2 of the Genocide Convention of 1948, in Article 6 of the Rome Statute of the ICC, and in Article 442 of the Ukrainian criminal code, forcibly removing children from one group to another with the aim of destroying a national, ethnic or racial group is an element of genocide.DW: What do you mean? Is Russia abducting Ukrainian children to turn them into Russians?Gerasymchuk: Yes, the Russians want to supplement their own population with Ukrainian children. Everything they are doing suggests that they do not intend to give the children back. Russia has sped up the procedures for adoption and naturalization, and is offering free schooling for children from Ukraine. What's more, the Russians are selecting children by carrying out so-called medical examinations in which the children are sorted into different categories. In other words, they are choosing the healthiest ones to supplement their own population with Ukrainian children.DW: In your opinion, is this part of a greater plan by Russia, or has it arisen from the current situation?Gerasymchuk: From the start of the invasion of Ukraine, Russia had a clear plan on what would happen with Ukrainian children. Its implementation began in 2014 following the annexation of Crimea. The Russians changed childrens' nationalities and set up the so-called ""Train of Hope,"" on which citizens of Russia could travel to Crimea to illegally adopt children.At the moment, there are at least five scenarios in Russia by which children are abducted. We came to this conclusion after analyzing the journeys of 308 children who managed to return to their parents in Kyiv-controlled Ukrainian territory.DW: What are these scenarios for child abduction?Gerasymchuk: In the first scenario, Russians separate children from their families during so-called filtration processes. The parents are arrested without charge and their children are simply taken away. There was one case in which a father of three was arrested and not released for three months. By then, the children were already in Russia, but we were able to reunite the family.In the second scenario, Russians kill the parents and take the children.In the third scenario, children are simply removed from their families. Sometimes this is done by revoking parental rights. This is often the case with ""troublesome parents"" who do not want to cooperate with the occupation authorities.The fourth scenario is when Russians do not allow us to fetch children from care institutions that have come under Russian occupation. Russia has never been willing to permit humanitarian corridors so that these children can be brought out. Instead, they are abducted. Since the start of the all-out invasion, children have been abducted from four facilities, and we were able to get them back from two.The fifth and final scenario is the most frequent. First, the Russians create poor living conditions for children in the occupied areas. Then they offer the parents to send their child away for supposed rehabilitation in a recreational camp inside Russia. But the children never return from these camps, and are taken elsewhere without their parents' permission. Some of the children we were able to bring back were in such camps for more than a year.DW: How can the children be brought back?Gerasymchuk: To find a child and bring it back, you have to know who to look for. That is why the state-run platform ""Children of War"" was created. It contains up-to-date information and personal data about children who are suffering in Russia because of the war. At the same time, the Russians hide our children as much as possible: They take them away, then try to change their names and so on. That is why searching for them can be very difficult, especially for young children who cannot remember where they come from.One very important point is whether the child being looked for has relatives in the area controlled by Ukraine who can organize guardianship and fetch the child from Russia with the help of the Ukrainian state.DW: Do you have up-to-date numbers on the abducted children?Gerasymchuk: All data is updated every morning on the platform ""Children of War."" At the moment, there are more than 16,000 children who have been deported and forcibly taken away. That is not just a number but a list of names based on information from parents, relatives, authorities or witnesses.These pieces of information are checked by the responsible authorities, and a separate investigation is launched for each child. That means we have concrete data. But a part of Ukraine's territory is occupied and we have no access. This is why citizens there will not be able to say who was abducted, and when, until after their liberation.It might be a matter of several hundreds of thousands of abducted children. In the media, Russian authorities speak of the ""evacuation"" of 744,000 Ukrainian children. But this number has not been confirmed by lists or personal data, so we believe this [the number] to be uncertain.The interview was conducted by Oleksandr Kunytskyi.This article was translated from German.",2023/03/25,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846526,Little room for maneuver as U.S.-China ties slide further,"WASHINGTON, March 23 (Reuters) - President Joe Biden said last month after a U.S. fighter jet shot down a suspected Chinese spy balloon that he planned to speak to Chinese President Xi Jinping about the episode and clear the air between the rival superpowers.Five weeks later, the call still hasn't happened.Instead, after two months of diplomatic sniping and Xi's trip this week to Moscow where he and Russian President Vladimir Putin jointly denounced the United States, U.S.-China relations have slid to what some say is the worst since the countries normalized ties in the 1970s.Further complicating matters are stopovers in the United States next week and in early April by Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen, who according to sources familiar with the planning may meet Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy during a ""transit"" stop in California on her way back from Latin America.""This is not a good moment for American diplomacy,"" said William Kirby, a professor of Chinese studies at Harvard University. ""The last time China and Russia were this close was 1957, when Mao Zedong declared in Moscow, 'The East Wind will prevail over the West Wind.'""Now U.S. officials are once again asking how to reset the world's most important bilateral relationship.A Biden-Xi call would be an obvious first step. But despite the efforts of U.S. diplomats, sources said the Chinese have shown little interest in committing to such a call, which would be their first known interaction since a November meeting at the G20 in Bali.Blinken did meet with China's top diplomat Wang Yi at the Munich Security Conference last month after the balloon incident, but this did not soothe tensions. A source familiar with that conversation called it the most antagonistic U.S.-China engagement since contentious talks in Alaska early in the Biden administration.The person said China had declined to coordinate the meeting, forcing the State Department's top East Asia diplomat, Daniel Kritenbrink, to personally track down Wang Yi at the conference center to ask whether it would happen.STATE OF THE UNION COMMENTThe U.S. decision to shoot down the Chinese balloon on Feb. 4 drew angry complaints from China and Wang called the U.S. reaction ""hysterical"".The source said frictions were also exacerbated by Biden's State of the Union speech three days later in which he appeared to question Xi's standing on the world stage, enraging officials in Beijing.""Name me a world leader who'd change places with Xi Jinping. Name me one,"" Biden said in his speech, evidently referring to a host of domestic and foreign policy challenges facing China.The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment.A National Security Council spokesperson was not available for comment.""In past times, when the relationship encountered a major dip, as after the Tiananmen massacre of 1989 or the Taiwan Strait crisis of 1995-96, the two countries made serious efforts to reestablish a stable foundation under their relations,"" said Michael Swaine, a China expert at the Quincy Institute.""Now a deepening level of suspicion, vitriol, and finger-pointing dominate almost all exchanges, preventing substantive engagement.""A senior U.S. administration official said on Monday Washington was urging China to keep communication channels open despite Tsai Ing-wen's planned stopovers, which are sensitive given that China claims self-governed Taiwan as its own.The official said Washington was open to China's views on whether to conduct a Xi-Biden call or reschedule a trip to China by Secretary of State Antony Blinken postponed due to the balloon incident.Rick Waters, the U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state for China, Taiwan and Mongolia, is currently in China and a person familiar with his plans said he would likely seek to lay the groundwork for Blinken to visit.AN EMBOLDENED CHINASome, like the Republican chair of the House select committee on China Mike Gallagher, want a tougher line, saying that Russia and China are already engaged in ""a New Cold War.""He said that to ensure China does not follow Russia's lead in Ukraine by invading Taiwan, Washington should ""aggressively clear the backlog of foreign military sales to Taiwan and ensure that American hard power is capable of deterring Xi's clear ambitions to absorb the island democracy.""However, Biden is likely to find Xi emboldened in any call after a Chinese-brokered rapprochement between Saudi Arabia and Iran and his meetings with Putin. That could make him less likely to offer concessions that could generate much-needed goodwill, said Lily McElwee, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.Daniel Russel, the top U.S. diplomat for East Asia under former President Barack Obama, said the window for a Biden-Xi call could be ""slow to open and quick to close"" given Biden will travel to Japan and Australia in May for meetings of G-7 and Quad countries Washington has encouraged to push back against China's ambitions, which will likely further antagonize Beijing.",2023/03/25,317,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846532,'What can we do?': Millions in African countries need power,"JOHANNESBURG (AP) — From Zimbabwe, where many must work at night because it's the only time there is power, to Nigeria where collapses of the grid are frequent, the reliable supply of electricity remains elusive across Africa.The electricity shortages that plague many of Africa's 54 countries are a serious drain on the continent’s economic growth, energy experts warn.In recent years South Africa's power generation has become so inadequate that the continent's most developed economy must cope with rolling power blackouts of eight to 10 hours per day.Africa's sprawling cities have erratic supplies of electricity but large swaths of the continent's rural areas have no power at all. In 2021, 43% of Africans — about 600 million people — lacked access to electricity with 590 million of them in sub‐Saharan Africa, according to the International Energy Agency.Investments of nearly $20 billion are required annually to achieve universal electrification across sub-Saharan Africa, according to World Bank estimates. Of that figure nearly $10 billion is needed annually bring power and keep it on in West and Central Africa.There are many reasons for Africa's dire delivery of electricity including ageing infrastructure, lack of government oversight and a shortage of skills to maintain the national grids, according to Andrew Lawrence, an energy expert at the Witwatersrand University Business School in Johannesburg.A historical problem is that many colonial regimes built electrical systems largely reserved for the minority white population and which excluded large parts of the Black population.Today many African countries rely on state-owned power utilities.Much attention has focused in the past two years on the Western-funded “Just Energy Transition,” in which France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States and the European Union are offering funds to help poorer countries move from highly polluting coal-fired power generation to renewable, environmentally-friendly sources of power. Africa as a region should be among the major beneficiaries in order to expand electricity access on the continent and improve the struggling power grids, said Lawrence.“The transition should target rural access and place at the forefront the electrification of the continent as a whole. This is something that is technically possible,” he said.The Western powers vowed to make $8.5 billion available to help South Africa move away from its coal-fired power plants, which produce 80% of the country's power.As a result of its dependence upon coal, South Africa is among the top 20 highest emitters of planet-warming greenhouse gases in the world and accounts for nearly a third of all of Africa’s emissions, according to experts.South Africa's plan to move away from coal, however, is hampered by its pressing need to produce as much power as possible each day.The East African nation of Uganda for years has also grappled with power cuts despite massive investment in electricity generation.Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country, has grappled with an inadequate power supply for many years, generating just 4,000 megawatts though the population of more than 210 million people needs 30,000 megawatts, say experts. The oil-rich but energy-poor West African nation has ramped up investments in the power sector but endemic corruption and mismanagement have resulted in little gains.In Zimbabwe, electricity shortages that have plagued the country for years have worsened as the state authority that manages Kariba, the country’s biggest dam, has limited power generation due to low water levels.Successive droughts have reduced Lake Kariba's level so much that the Kariba South Hydro Power Station, which provides Zimbabwe with about 70% of its electricity, is currently producing just 300 megawatts, far less than its capacity of 1,050 megawatts.Zimbabwe's coal-fired power stations that also provide some electricity have become unreliable due to aging infrastructure marked by frequent breakdowns. The country’s solar potential is yet to be fully developed to meaningfully augment supply.This means that Harare barber Omar Chienda never knows when he'll have the power needed to run his electric clippers.“What can we do? We just have to wait until electricity is back but most of the time it comes back at night,"" said Chienda, a 39-year-old father of three. ""That means I can’t work, my family goes hungry.”In Nigeria’s capital city of Abuja, restaurant owner Favour Ben, 29, said she spends a large part of her monthly budget on electricity bills and on petrol for her generator, but adds that she gets only an average of 7 hours of power daily.“It has been very difficult, especially after paying your electricity bill and they don’t give you light."" said Ben. ""Most times, I prepare customers’ orders but if there is no light (power for a refrigerator), it turns bad the next day (and) I have lost money for that.”Businesses in Nigeria suffer an annual loss of $29 billion as a result of unreliable electricity, the World Bank said, with providers of essential services often struggling to keep their operations afloat on generators.As delegates gathered in Cape Town this month to discuss Africa’s energy challenges, there was a resounding sentiment that drawn-out power shortages on the continent had to be addressed urgently. There was some hope that the Western-funded “Just Energy Transition” would create some opportunities, but many remained skeptical.Among the biggest critics of efforts to have countries like South Africa to transition quickly from the use of coal to cleaner energy is South Africa’s Minister of Mineral Resources and Energy Gwede Mantashe.He is among those advocating that Africa use all sources available to it to produce adequate power for the continent, including natural gas, solar, wind, hydropower and especially coal.“Coal will be with us for many years to come. Those who see it as corruption or a road to whatever, they are going to be disappointed for many, many years,"" said Mantashe. ""Coal is going to outlive many of us.”___AP journalists Chinedu Asadu in Abuja, Nigeria; Farai Mutsaka in Harare, Zimbabwe; and Rodney Muhumuza in Kampala, Uganda, contributed.",2023/03/26,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846533,Berlin vote could turbocharge German capital's climate plans,"BERLIN (AP) — Voters in Berlin go to the polls this weekend to decide on a proposal that would force the city government to drastically ramp up the German capital’s climate goals.Sunday's referendum, which has attracted considerable financial support from U.S.-based philanthropists, calls for Berlin to become climate neutral by 2030, meaning that within less than eight years the city would not be allowed to contribute further to global warming. An existing law sets the deadline for achieving that goal at 2045, which is also Germany's national target.The center-right Christian Democratic Union, which won a recent local election in the capital and is likely to lead its new government, opposes the earlier target but would be bound to implement it if the referendum passes.Jessamine Davis, a spokesperson for the grassroots group that initiated the vote, said Berlin's current target isn't in line with the 2015 Paris climate accord, which aims to cap global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) compared with the pre-industrial average.“This is a very ambitious target, we're clear about that. And it won't be easy,” she said of the plan to cut almost all emissions by 2030. “But the climate crisis is an even bigger challenge.”Davis pointed to the flood disaster in western Germany two years ago that killed more than 180 people and caused tens of billions of euros (dollars) in economic damage. Scientists say such disasters could become more likely as the planet warms. By contrast, redesigning Berlin's city-wide heating network so it becomes carbon neutral is estimated to cost 4 billion euros, she said.Polls show Berliners are narrowly in favor of the proposal, but the law also requires that it win the support of at least 25% of the city’s 2.4 million eligible voters to pass — something that could be harder to achieve on a day when no elections or other votes are taking place.To draw attention to the referendum, Davis' group has conducted a large-scale advertising campaign, helped by donations of almost 1.2 million euros ($1.3 million). While about 150,000 euros came from crowdfunding, most of the money was provided by philanthropic organizations and individuals.The biggest chunk — over 400,000 euros — came from German-American investors Albert Wenger and Susan Danziger.In emails to The Associated Press, Wenger said the U.S.-based couple had “a long history of supporting climate movements and making investments in innovative solutions to the climate crisis.”“The Berlin ballot initiative demonstrates that citizens in a democratic process are demanding faster and stronger climate action,” he said. “This is a replicable model for the rest of the world and could result in achieving climate neutrality by 2030 before major tipping points are crossed.”Stefan Evers, a senior lawmaker for the Christian Democrats, said his party acknowledges the “historic challenge” of climate change and the impacts it is already having on Berlin and its 3.7 million inhabitants.The party has proposed increasing the budget for climate-related measures by 5 to 10 billion euros, but Evers said the investments required if the referendum passes would break the bank.“Everybody who votes ‘yes’ on Sunday needs to ask themselves: Do we want to make drastic savings on kindergartens, schools, public sports facilities, homeless aid and social housing because of this referendum, or not,'” he told fellow lawmakers Thursday.Evers warned that if estimates of a 100 billion-euro price tag for the measures are accurate, “then in a few years Berlin won't be climate-neutral but bankrupt.”Strong criticism of the plan has also come from newspapers owned by German media giant Axel Springer. Its biggest shareholder is American investment firm KKR, which has sizeable financial interests in the fossil fuel industry.In a statement, Axel Springer dismissed as “absurd” any suggestion that its publications could be influenced by the interests of its owners. “Economic interests or those of third parties don't play a role in the coverage by our media,” it said.Davis said she's optimistic about the referendum's chances, “but what really counts now is that everybody goes to the polls."" Days before the referendum her group complained that many voters who requested postal ballots had not received them.",2023/03/25,,World

I disagree with the article written by Major Rick Chersicla, ""Stop Talking About a 'Chinese Way of War'"" in The Diplomat on 14 March 2023. This article commits the mirror-imaging error, which in trying to understand the adversary, is one of the biggest mistakes any military planner, strategist, policy and decision-maker can make. I will identify errors in his arguments and highlight why the Chinese Communist strategy is different from the Western model.
Similar and different strategic thinkers
A cursory review and comparison of US military doctrine with Chinese Communist military doctrine reveals that US military doctrine refers almost exclusively to Western military strategists. Sun Tzu receives a token footnote. In contrast, the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) strategy fuses Western and Eastern military, political and economic thought.
For example, the Science of Military Strategy (2013) cites 28 sources: twenty of these sources are not mentioned in US military doctrine, such as Lenin, Marx, Mao, Deng Xiaoping, Jiang Zemin, Chinese strategists, and PLA authors. Eight Western sources were translated into Mandarin, and include Clausewitz, Jomini, Liddell-Hart, Sokolovsky, and the US Military Academy’s Military Strategy.
This initial comparison of Chinese and American doctrinal instruction materials should not calm concerns. I have attended all levels of US professional military education (PME) and these PME schools did not teach adversary strategy to any level of competency. Underlying the Chinese approach to adversary strategy is Sun Tzu’s often quoted guidance in The Art of War 3:18: “If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat.”
Mirror imaging










The absence of instruction on adversary strategy in American PME is compounded by the propensity to commit the analytical error of mirror-imaging. In Psychology of Intelligence Analysis (2009), Richards J. Heuer, Jr. describes mirror-imaging as a source of error in describing the thoughts and actions of an adversary:

“Be Wary of Mirror Images. One kind of assumption an analyst should always recognize and question is mirror-imaging filling gaps in the analyst’s own knowledge by assuming that the other side is likely to act in a certain way, because that is how the US would act under similar circumstances.” (p. 70)

Mirror-imaging, as a way of thinking, is dangerous because it prevents analysts from accurately describing adversary thinking and behavior. Heuer cites former Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral David Jeremiah, who headed a review of the intelligence failure to predict India’s 1998 nuclear weapons test, and named the failure: “everybody-thinks-like-us mind-set. … the ‘underlying mind-set' was that India ‘would behave as we behave,’ … ‘We should have been much more aggressive in thinking through how the other guy thought.’”
Replace India in the above reference with China or Russia and you understand my point. For example, Edward Luttwak, one of the greatest grand strategists of our generation, noted that the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) predicted the invasion of Ukraine in 2023 would be a cakewalk for the Russian military. The CIA and the FSB were wrong; they did not understand Ukrainians and their will to fight.
Red teams and alternative assessments
The Indian government developed and conducted an elaborate denial and deception plan to prevent the US from applying pressure on it not to conduct the tests. The Jeremiah Report recommended two correctives to mirror-imaging: (1) engage outside regional experts to provide expertise in describing an adversaries’ history and worldview, and (2) conduct red team and alternative assessments to apply regional and country-specific knowledge to a hypothetical situation.
According to the US military’s Joint Publication 5-0 Joint Planning (2020), “red team complements intelligence efforts by offering independent, alternative assessments and differing interpretations of information. This includes critical reviews of intelligence products, considering problem sets from alternative perspectives, and helping contribute informed speculation when reliable information is lacking.”
Chinese deception
Just as the US intelligence community failed to predict the Indian nuclear tests, the US has failed in its analysis of the intentions and capabilities of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the PLA. Such failures are not accidental. Deception permeates PLA’s military doctrine and all efforts by the CCP and its subordinate elements.
The Chinese communists employed deception and subterfuge—to compensate for inferiority in training and equipment—during their war with the Imperial Japanese and the Chinese Nationalist forces from 1 August 1927 until 7 December 1949. The West is not adept at using deception beyond the military arena, whereas the CCP has practiced employing deception in every dimension of the struggle.
Michael Pillsbury realized late in his long government career the vast extent of the CCP’s strategic deception. In The Hundred Year Marathon (2016), Pillsbury identified the following elements of deception in the Chinese strategy to defeat the US:
1. Induce complacency to avoid alerting your opponent. Chinese strategy holds that a powerful adversary, such as the United States today, should never be provoked prematurely. Instead, one’s true intentions should be completely guarded until the ideal moment to strike arrives.
2. Manipulate your opponent’s advisers. Chinese strategy emphasizes turning the opponent’s house in on itself by winning over influential advisers surrounding the opponent’s leadership apparatus. Such efforts have long been a hallmark of China’s relations with the United States…
4. Steal your opponent’s ideas and technology for strategic purposes. Hardly hindered by Western-style legal prohibitions and constitutional principles, China clearly endorses theft for strategic gain. Such theft provides a relatively easy, cost-effective means by which a weaker state can usurp power from a more powerful one…
7. Never lose sight of shi [national vitality]. … two elements of shi are critical components of Chinese strategy: deceiving others into doing your bidding for you, and waiting for the point of maximum opportunity to strike…
9. Always be vigilant to avoid being encircled or deceived by others. In what could be characterized as a deeply ingrained sense of paranoia, China’s leaders believe that because all other potential rivals are out to deceive them, China must respond with its own duplicity… (pp. 35-36)
Pillsbury’s description of the principal elements of Chinese strategy to defeat the US are unlike those used in Western states. The CCP’s focus on deception is key to their goal of defeating the US.
Sun Tzu and Mao
Major Chersicla provides many good examples of Western applications of military deception, yet his article lacks examples of how Mao—and his successors—applied deception.
Mao’s famous speech given in 1938, On Protracted War, states unequivocally that “’There can never be too much deception in war’, means precisely this.” He added, “to achieve victory we must as far as possible make the enemy blind and deaf by sealing his eyes and ears and drive his commanders to distraction by creating confusion in their minds.”
These concepts correlate to Sun Tzu’s “All warfare is based on deception.” Mao and Sun Tzu agree on the key role of deception in all conflicts which contradicts Major Chersicla’s claim that “[i]n terms of military theory, however, these two strategists [Mao and Sun Tzu] – as enduring as their legacies are – do not align on key points, let alone represent an unknowable Chinese way of war.” The CCP seeks to confuse the rest of the world about its true intentions and goals.
Unrestricted Warfare
Chinese deception is not only key to military operations: deception must inform all aspects of the struggle, especially political warfare and other types of warfare cited in Unrestricted Warfare, authored in 1999 by two senior PLA Air Force colonels.

(Unrestricted Warfare, p.146)
The PLA colonels used the above list of warfare to explain how “warfare” goes beyond the kinetic or classic shooting war. Instead, “[a]ny of the above types of methods of operation can be combined with another of the above methods of operation to form a completely new method of operation” (p. 146).
The emerging Chinese Communist revolution in military affairs uses combinations of warfare types (from the columns, military, trans-military, and non-military) to achieve the CCP’s objectives. The list enables CCP and PLA planners to conceptualize novel and specific configurations of capabilities, at tactical, operational, and strategic levels, against their adversaries. In contrast, the West, including the US, lack the intellectual tools to identify, describe, assess, and counter the challenges posed by the CCP and PLA. Thanks to Dr Mark D. Mandeles for his thoughts on this subject.
Spying
The main reason the Chinese Nationalist forces (Kuomintang) were defeated by the Chinese Communist forces was that the US made the Kuomintang forces concentrate on fighting the Imperial Japanese military instead of the Communist Chinese forces so that the US could prosecute a Europe first policy.
At least three additional factors aided the Chinese Communists during the Chinese civil war: corrupt Nationalist officers, ill-treatment of Nationalist soldiers and civilians under Kuomintang control, and the vast infiltration of the Chinese communist network of spies into Chiang Kai-Shek’s military. Many analysts discuss CCP’s intelligence operations successes, including Nicholas Eftimiades, Roger Faligot, William C. Hannas, Alex Joske, Matthew Brazil, and Peter Mattis.
The PLA used Sun Tzu’s dictum of never fighting your adversary’s strengths and always using your strength against the enemy’s weakness. The PLA exploited the corruption and the dismal morale of the Kuomintang forces. Today, the CCP and the PLA continue this tradition of subterfuge, deception, and manipulation.
Spying for the CCP
PRC citizens are legally obligated to participate in information and intelligence collection. Article 7 of the National Intelligence Law (2017 and amended 2018) requires every Chinese citizen and organization to spy for the CCP. The relevant passage states:

“All organizations and citizens shall support, assist, and cooperate with national intelligence efforts in accordance with law, and shall protect national intelligence work secrets they are aware of. The State protects individuals and organizations that support, assist, and cooperate with national intelligence efforts.”

Article 14 specifies that CCP intelligence agencies can legally insist on this support:

“The state intelligence work organization shall carry out intelligence work according to law, and may require relevant organs, organizations and citizens to provide necessary support, assistance and cooperation.”

Mobilizing ethnic Chinese overseas to collect information of all types for the CCP is a feature of everyday life in the Chinese diaspora. The National Intelligence Law uses “language that does not limit these demands on individuals to Chinese citizens.” The CCP expects nationalist sympathy or threatened coercion against relatives and friends living in the People’s Republic of China (PRC) to motivate every ethnic Chinese person in the world to uphold this law.
The Western view of spying is limited to political and military intelligence. For example, CCP economic espionage seeks to gain economic and military advantage against non-Communist Chinese competitors. These efforts are conducted by CCP intelligence collectors from the Ministry of State Security, United Front Work Department, Ministry of Public Security, and the PLA. Western intelligence agencies do not pursue this kind of intelligence on behalf of western private corporations to enhance their corporate advantage against their competitors. These CCP’s actions reveal a new kind of intelligence warfare designed to strengthen their comprehensive national power.
Conclusion
Major Chersicla’s article focuses more on the similarities than the key differences between Western and Chinese Communist concepts of warfare. In this article, I tried to highlight those differences and to familiarize readers with the key areas of divergence and the dangers of mirror-imaging.
I encourage Major Chersicla and other military strategists, policy and decision makers to visit Taiwan and meet with ROC military and academic experts that have been studying the CCP’s and PLA’s way of war. In the future, I hope we do not read a case study of a mirror-imaging failure regarding how the CCP’s plan for global domination succeeded.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846577,Myanmar lawyer accused of helping army slain by guerrillas,"BANGKOK (AP) — A veteran corporate lawyer has been shot dead in Myanmar’s biggest city by self-proclaimed urban guerrillas, highlighting the bloody struggle between the military government and its foes in the country’s cities as well as the remote countryside.Min Tayza Nyunt Tin was shot multiple times while driving his car in Yangon on Friday, according to a business colleague, media reports and a statement from the guerrilla group.The group, calling itself Urban Owls, accused him of being a business associate of the country’s military leaders who seized power two years ago, and claimed he helped them launder money in order to buy real estate and business assets abroad in deals totaling hundreds of millions of dollars.Its claims could not be independently verified, and a colleague of Min Tayza denied the guerrillas’ allegations. The victim was the founder and CEO of BIZ Law Consult Myanmar, a law firm specializing in intellectual property and trademark law.Media outlets sympathetic to the military reported on the Telegram messaging app that the 56-year-old was shot by members of the People’s Defense Force.It's a loosely organized armed wing of the pro-democracy National Unity Government, which opposes the military government that was established when the army seized power in February 2021 from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi. Many of the opposition forces operate autonomously of the National Unity Government.The army takeover triggered widespread peaceful protests that were quashed with lethal force, triggering armed resistance that U.N. experts now characterize as civil war.Urban guerrillas have carried out targeted killings, arson and small bombings since 2021. Victims included officials and members of the military as well as people believed to be informers or military collaborators. In November 2021, a former navy officer who was the chief finance officer of Myanmar’s military-linked telecommunications company was fatally shot on a Yangon street.The army has clamped down harshly on opponents in the cities, arresting thousands and using deadly force even against nonviolent demonstrators. According to a detailed list by the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, a rights monitoring organization, at least 3,160 civilians have been killed by security forces since the army seized power.The statement issued by the Urban Owls guerrillas cited what it claimed were social media postings by Min Tayza, including one that expressed gratitude to former air force commander Myat Hein for helping him make his fortune.The guerrillas’ statement also claimed Min Tayza “has publicly announced on Facebook that he shall ‘only provide services to reliable friends and supporters of the military’ shortly after the 2021 coup took place.”The citations could not be verified, because the Facebook account where the comments allegedly were posted is marked as a private one.The guerrillas' statement said the shooting is “yet another warning to all business tycoons and associates” of the country's military.“We are among many guerrilla groups in Yangon who are aware of your money laundering schemes and blood money deals, and shall spare no one standing against the Spring Revolution of Myanmar,” it said.A member of BIZ Law Consult Myanmar company confirmed Min Tayza’s death to The Associated Press on Friday night but denied the allegation of his military links. The person spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of arrest by the military and attacks by urban guerrillas.“I want to say that none of the allegations are correct. We only give services for intellectual property for business firms. We are not associated with them (the military),” the person said.The firm’s Facebook page also promotes opening bank accounts, buying property and getting retirement visas in neighboring Thailand, where the company has an office. Well-to-do Myanmar residents, not just supporters of the military, have sought to transfer assets to Thailand, which they consider a safe haven.Myanmar’s economy has been in shambles due to civil disobedience, mismanagement by the military and economic sanctions imposed by Western nations as a consequence of the army’s seizure of power and human rights abuses.On Friday, the U.S. government announced a new set of sanctions against two individuals and six companies meant to stem the supply of jet fuel to Myanmar. Activists say blocking the supply of jet fuel can hinder Myanmar’s military from carrying out air strikes in the countryside, which often cause civilian casualties.",2023/03/25,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846578,Shoma Uno of Japan repeats as world figure skating champion,"SAITAMA, Japan (AP) — Shoma Uno prevailed in a quad showdown in the free skate on Saturday to become the first Japanese man to defend his title at the figure skating world championships.Uno, skating to selection of music that included Bach, attempted five quadruple jumps at Saitama Super Arena. He landed all of them except the quad salchow which he under-rotated for a total of 301.14 points.South Korean skater Cha Jun-hwan was second with 296.03 points followed by American teenager Ilia Malinin, who became the first skater to land a quadruple axel at the world championships and finished with 288.44 points.“The free skate was far from perfect but I put everything into it,” Uno said. “Every jump felt precarious but I was able to get a good result.”Uno capped an impressive perfomance by the hosts that saw Japanese skaters take gold in three out of four disciplines for the first time in history. Kaori Sakamoto won the women’s title while Riku Miura and Ryuichi Kihara won the pairs gold.“The past two weeks have been very tough because I wasn’t in peak condition, and I caused a lot of concern to everyone around me,” Uno said. “But I was able to pay them back and show my gratitude with my performance today.”Cha, third after the short program, moved up to second with a powerful routine that featured a quad salchow and a quad toeloop.Cha landed all his jumps cleanly except for a triple flip on his way to becoming the first South Korean man to win a medal at the world championships.“It’s an honor to be the first male skater as a Korean skater to get a (world) medal,” Cha said.Malinin attempted six quadruple jumps. He landed his opening quad axel but under-rotated a quad lutz which was part of a combination and was deducted points on a quad flip and a quad lutz.It was Malinin’s first medal at the world championships. He finished ninth in his 2022 debut in Montpellier, France.“I was nervous at the beginning so I was glad to pull it off,” Malinin said. “I’m just very shocked by how much I have progressed this season.”Coached by his parents who represented Uzbekistan, the 18-year-old Malinin is the only skater to land a quadruple axel, widely considered the hardest jump in figure skating, in competition.Russia’s dominant skating team has been excluded from the world championships for the second straight year because of the invasion of Ukraine.Meanwhile, Madison Chock and Evan Bates of the United States won their first ice dance title.First after the rhythm dance, Chock and Bates finished first in the free dance with 134.07 points for a total of 226.1.Reigning European Champions Charlene Guignard and Marco Fabbri of Italy were second with 219.85 points while Grand Prix Final Champions Piper Gilles and Paul Poirier of Canada were third with 217.88.Chock fell once but it was not on a required element.“We had to dig very, very deep many times, but I know we would not be sitting here without all this experience,” Chock said, adding the fall came as a shock to her. “I just caught my heel on the ice and it was so surprising.”Chock and Bates, the three-time Four Continents champions, have been together for 12 years.They won the silver medal at the 2015 world championships in Shanghai, bronze in Boston in 2016 and bronze last year in Montpellier.They have also competed at six Grand Prix Finals, winning four medals — all silver.“We’ve been pursuing this goal for so many years,” Bates said. “It was exciting and stressful all at the same time. I know that the ice dance field is very competitive. We’ve competed against all these teams for so many years.“We really wanted to focus on ourselves, and skate our best, and highlight all the work that we’ve put this year into these programs.”The 2024 world championships will take place in Montreal, Canada.___More AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/25,,World

It analyzes the market as well as the competitive landscapes in the United States. The Decaf Ground Coffee report is based on industry judgements by experts. This report gives insight into market growth statistics and new areas.Decaf coffee consumption is expected to surge in developing countries due to rising disposable incomes and shifting consumer preferences. As more people opt for this healthier option, the decaf market will expand as people seek ways to reduce their caffeine intake. With increased demand for decaf, several new companies have emerged that offer various varieties of the beverage. As decaf becomes more accessible in emerging nations, the global decaf industry will experience growth.Request for a sample report here: https://market.biz/report/global-decaf-ground-coffee-market-yhr/1466174/#requestforsampleGlobal consumer health concerns have caused an uptick in arabica coffee consumption. Arabica beans contain more vitamins and minerals than other coffees, while Robusta beans have more sugar. As consumers transition towards sweeter flavors from Robusta beans, content decaffeination will become even more successful. This coffee variety stands out for its exceptional taste, aroma, and body; due to its high sugar and lipid content it imparts a fruity note.Organic decaf coffee producers now have the unique opportunity to offer organic decaf as demand for it grows. Decaffeinated, lightly roasted beans are becoming increasingly popular with millennials who value organic cultivation practices and sustainability. As such, many cafes, coffee shops, and restaurants are now providing decaf-based dishes in response to this rising interest in decaf. As part of their lifestyle trend of working and socializing in such places, millennials may increase their consumption of decaffeinated drinks accordingly.Tesco Groceries

MCEX will bring about an unprecedented economically inclusive and socially impactful financial market that supports grassroots entrepreneurship, increases job opportunities and helps achieve ""common prosperity"".   Mr. Chan Sau San, Chairman of the Board of the Macau Monetary Authority, said in his speech, ""The Macau Monetary Authority is actively deploying the development of the modern financial industry, taking advantage of Macao's highly open financial system, and introducing different types of financial institutions to settle in Macao. It is hoped that after the trial operation of MCEX, the business model will be gradually straightened out and a solid risk prevention mechanism will be established; at the same time, opportunities will be fully seized, based on the location advantage of the ""intersection"" of Macao's dual circulation, and international funds will be introduced to help China's micro and small businesses and the real economy, and contribute to Macao's economic diversification.""

He said: ""The establishment of MCEX means that financing via financial exchanges is no longer exclusive to a small number of large corporates, but now a convenient choice for millions of micro and small businesses. As an important channel for these entities, Macao will rise to become a new international financial center in the digital age.""   The listing of the first batch of Micro Connect's DROs was kicked off by Mr. Li, Mr. Zhang and owners of three stores in Mainland China funded by the MCEX platform, marking the start of a new funding channel for China's micro and small businesses.   Lastly, Mr. Gary Zhang said, ""Let us remember this very moment. This is the first batch of micro and small businesses being funded on the exchange in human history! This is a historic moment for MCEX and for Macao, but most of all, for countless of micro and small businesses! Let us all cheer for Macao and the entrepreneurs of China!""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846633,"Intel co-founder, philanthropist Gordon Moore dies at 94","SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Gordon Moore, the Intel Corp. co-founder who set the breakneck pace of progress in the digital age with a simple 1965 prediction of how quickly engineers would boost the capacity of computer chips, has died. He was 94.Moore died Friday at his home in Hawaii, according to Intel and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation.Moore, who held a Ph.D. in chemistry and physics, made his famous observation — now known as “Moore's Law” — three years before he helped start Intel in 1968. It appeared among a number of articles about the future written for the now-defunct Electronics magazine by experts in various fields.The prediction, which Moore said he plotted out on graph paper based on what had been happening with chips at the time, said the capacity and complexity of integrated circuits would double every year.Strictly speaking, Moore’s observation referred to the doubling of transistors on a semiconductor. But over the years, it has been applied to hard drives, computer monitors and other electronic devices, holding that roughly every 18 months a new generation of products makes their predecessors obsolete.It became a standard for the tech industry’s progress and innovation.“It's the human spirit. It's what made Silicon Valley,” Carver Mead, a retired California Institute of Technology computer scientist who coined the term ""Moore's Law"" in the early 1970s, said in 2005. ""It's the real thing.""Moore later became known for his philanthropy when he and his wife established the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, which focuses on environmental conservation, science, patient care and projects in the San Francisco Bay area. It has donated more than $5.1 billion to charitable causes since its founding in 2000.“Those of us who have met and worked with Gordon will forever be inspired by his wisdom, humility and generosity,” foundation president Harvey Fineberg said in a statement.Intel Chairman Frank Yeary called Moore a brilliant scientist and a leading American entrepreneur.“It is impossible to imagine the world we live in today, with computing so essential to our lives, without the contributions of Gordon Moore,” he said.In his book “Moore’s Law: The Life of Gordon Moore, Silicon Valley’s Quiet Revolutionary,"" author David Brock called him “the most important thinker and doer in the story of silicon electronics.”Moore was born in San Francisco on Jan. 3, 1929, and grew up in the tiny nearby coastal town of Pescadero. As a boy, he took a liking to chemistry sets. He attended San Jose State University, then transferred to the University of California, Berkeley, where he graduated with a degree in chemistry.After getting his Ph.D. from the California Institute of Technology in 1954, he worked briefly as a researcher at Johns Hopkins University.His entry into microchips began when he went to work for William Shockley, who in 1956 shared the Nobel Prize for physics for his work inventing the transistor. Less than two years later, Moore and seven colleagues left Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory after growing tired of its namesake's management practices.The defection by the ""traitorous eight,"" as the group came to be called, planted the seeds for Silicon Valley's renegade culture, in which engineers who disagreed with their colleagues didn't hesitate to become competitors.The Shockley defectors in 1957 created Fairchild Semiconductor, which became one of the first companies to manufacture the integrated circuit, a refinement of the transistor.Fairchild supplied the chips that went into the first computers that astronauts used aboard spacecraft.In 1968, Moore and Robert Noyce, one of the eight engineers who left Shockley, again struck out on their own. With $500,000 of their own money and the backing of venture capitalist Arthur Rock, they founded Intel, a name based on joining the words ""integrated"" and “electronics.”Moore became Intel's chief executive in 1975. His tenure as CEO ended in 1987, thought he remained chairman for another 10 years. He was chairman emeritus from 1997 to 2006.He received the National Medal of Technology from President George H.W. Bush in 1990 and the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President George W. Bush in 2002.Despite his wealth and acclaim, Moore remained known for his modesty. In 2005, he referred to Moore's Law as “a lucky guess that got a lot more publicity than it deserved.”He is survived by his wife of 50 years, Betty, sons Kenneth and Steven, and four grandchildren.___This story corrects the name of California Institute of Technology.",2023/03/26,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846634,India's Rahul Gandhi accuses PM Modi of favoring Adani Group,"NEW DELHI (AP) — India’s top opposition leader Rahul Gandhi on Saturday launched a scathing attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and said he was being targeted because he has raised serious questions about Modi's relationship with the Indian business conglomerate Adani Group.Gandhi said the objective of his expulsion from Parliament on Friday was to prevent him from speaking in the legislature about his allegation of an infusion of an unaccounted $3 billion into shell companies owned by the Adani Group, headed by Gautam Adani.’’Some of these defense companies are working in drone and missile development and ordnance production. Why is the defense ministry not asking questions,” he said.Gandhi was expelled from Parliament a day after a court convicted him of defamation and sentenced him to two years in prison for mocking the surname Modi in an election speech.The actions against Gandhi, the great-grandson of India’s first prime minister, were widely condemned by opponents of Modi as the latest assaults against democracy and free speech by a ruling government seeking to crush dissent. Removing Gandhi from politics delivered a major blow to the opposition party he led ahead of next year’s national elections.Gandhi said he was not bothered about losing his seat in Parliament. ""My job is to defend the institutions of the country and the voice of people,"" he added.A court in the western Indian city of Surat also sentenced him to two years in prison on Thursday. But he won’t go to jail immediately as the court granted bail for 30 days to file an appeal against the verdict.The court convicted Gandhi for a 2019 speech in which he asked, “Why do all thieves have Modi as their surname?” Gandhi then referred to three well-known and unrelated Modis in the speech: a fugitive Indian diamond tycoon, a cricket executive banned from the Indian Premier League tournament and the prime minister.On Saturday, Gandhi didn't indicate how soon his legal team will approach an appeals court seeking to overturn his conviction so he could save his seat in Parliament.He accused Modi of helping the Adani Group to get contracts in India, Sri Lanka, and Australia.He also alleged that a Chinese national was involved in investments in Adani's shell companies. “Why nobody is asking the question who this Chinese national is,” he said. ”Nobody knows where this money has come from. Adani couldn't generate this money.""Gandhi has demanded a parliamentary committee probe following a report by Hindenburg Research, the U.S. financial research firm, accusing the Adani Group of stock price manipulation and fraud running into billions of dollars. The Adani Group has denied any wrongdoing and the Modi government has not accepted a call for a parliamentary investigation.Soon after Gandhi's news conference, Ravi Shankar Prasad, a top leader of Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party, rejected Gandhi's accusations and said his disqualification from Parliament had nothing to do with the Adani Group controversy.Since Modi became prime minister in 2014, Adani’s net worth has shot up nearly 2,000% to $125 billion, according to Bloomberg’s Billionaire Index. He surpassed Amazon boss Jeff Bezos to briefly become the world’s second richest man in September after a surge in the value of his seven listed entities.Adani’s businesses have won multibillion-dollar contracts to build ports, highways and power plants. The industrialist’s ambitions include developing drones and ammunition, key to the government’s goal of boosting military-related exports to $5 billion while slashing costs for expensive imports.",2023/03/25,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846653,Sharing New Zealand's Indigenous knowledge in Taiwan,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A group of young New Zealand Maori have been providing strong competition for their competitors at the 2023 Taiwan National Indigenous Games, and are making a mark by taking on a range of internships in Taipei while training for the Games' events.
Taiwan News spoke to members of the team in Taipei on Saturday (March 25) about Taiwan, their experience participating in the Indigenous Games, and their internships, which were provided by New Zealand group Tupu Toa and U.K. firm Pagoda Projects. Tupu Toa works to increase Maori and Pacific representation in business leadership positions, and is led by Tina Wilson, who is also the Trade Commissioner for the New Zealand Commerce and Industry Office in Taipei.
PhD student at New Zealand's Waikato University Edmond Carrucan is one of the two team members interning at the New Zealand office under the mentorship of Commissioner Wilson. He told Taiwan News that he can bring Maori knowledge and concepts into his work while in Taiwan, which will be helpful for him when he returns to New Zealand.
“Our work focuses on helping New Zealand businesses be competitive internationally in the import export markets,” Currucan said. “Going back home, it’s going to be a nice opener, to be able to say ‘I actually previously helped your business’,” he said.










Wilson said the team has a wide range of internship positions in tech, business, user experience, and other applications, and that they are learning about an important region for New Zealand’s economy and business. She said that what New Zealand produces, and how it produces it, makes the country’s output highly sought after in Taiwan.
“New Zealand is seven times larger than Taiwan with five times less population, and we produce 40 times more than we can consume as a nation, so we’re a good partner in that regard,” Wilson said. She also said that New Zealand can export its environmental values through exports to Taiwan.
“In New Zealand we talk about Kaitiakitanga (a Maori concept referring to environmental guardianship) being external and about the environment, how we care for the land, the rivers, the air,” she said. “Here in Taiwan it’s actually what you can consume, the fact that our food is grown and produced with good quality air, water, and soils, means that the food they consume is higher quality for them, and that’s important.”
New Zealand and Taiwan’s free trade agreement was the first in the world to include an Indigenous to Indigenous chapter. Wilson said this has helped nurture cultural and educational exchanges between the two sides to date, but added the relationship between New Zealand Maori and Taiwan’s Indigenous people goes back far further than that.
“Aside from New Zealand and Taiwan as known economies now, Maori and Indigenous Taiwanese have the same DNA, so we have an ancestral connection that is 5,000 years plus old,” she said. “These relationships have been here a lot longer than any other enforcing agencies around the edges.”
Currucan said there is good value in the exchanges between his team and Indigenous Taiwanese, but viewed through his eyes, the Austronesian connection (based on archaeological and linguistic evidence) has some methodological shortcomings. “For me, as a person who is Maori, instead of all those Western metrics and that Western knowledge, I would be most interested in the Matauranga Maori (Maori knowledge systems) to support an Indigenous knowledge claim.”
He said that during his time in Taiwan, he could see a shared respect for elders between Maori and Indigenous Taiwanese, and that this could be a basis for cooperation based on mutual understanding.
The remaining events for the Indigenous Games will be held in sporting venues throughout Taipei until March 27, and the schedule can be seen here (Chinese language version). The Maori team is set to participate in dance and archery events on March 26 and 27.TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A group of young New Zealand Maori have been providing strong competition for their competitors at the 2023 Taiwan National Indigenous Games, and are making a mark by taking on a range of internships in Taipei while training for the Games' events.Taiwan News spoke to members of the team in Taipei on Saturday (March 25) about Taiwan, their experience participating in the Indigenous Games, and their internships, which were provided by New Zealand group Tupu Toa and U.K. firm Pagoda Projects.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846670,"Germany, EU reach agreement in combustion engine row","BERLIN (AP) — Germany and the European Union announced Saturday that they have reached an agreement in their dispute over the future of cars with combustion engines, allowing the registration of new vehicles with such engines even after 2035 provided they use climate-neutral fuel only.EU Commission Vice-President Frans Timmermans tweeted that “we have found an agreement with Germany on the future use of e-fuels in cars.”German Transport Minister Volker Wissing tweeted that the way had been cleared for vehicles with internal combustion engines that only use climate-neutral fuels to be newly registered even after 2035.“We secure opportunities for Europe by preserving important options for climate-neutral and affordable mobility,"" Wissing wrote.An initial proposal by European Union member countries on new carbon dioxide emission standards for cars had been postponed amid opposition from Germany. The EU had wanted to ban the sale of all new cars with combustion engines from 2035.Germany had demanded an exemption for cars that burn e-fuels, arguing that they are carbon neutral when produced using renewable energy and carbon captured from the air so they wouldn’t spew further climate-changing emissions into the atmosphere.Wissing said they had agreed on concrete procedural steps and that a specific timetable has been made binding. “We want the process to be completed by fall 2024,” he added.Timmermans also wrote that “we will work now on getting the CO2-standards for cars regulation adopted as soon as possible.”The issue has driven an ideological wedge within the German government between Wissing’s libertarian Free Democratic Party, or FDP, and the environmentalist Green party, which had backed a complete ban on combustion engines.Germany’s main opposition party, the center-right Union bloc, also opposed an EU-wide ban on combustion engine vehicles, warning that it would harm the country’s prized auto industry.Critics say battery-electric technology is a better fit for passenger cars and precious synthetic fuels should be used only where no other option is feasible, such as in aviation.The environmental group Greenpeace criticized the agreement sharply.“This lazy compromise undermines climate protection in transport, and it harms Europe,"" the group wrote in a statement.German Chancellor Olaf Scholz “let the FDP get away with its reckless blackmailing of the EU for far too long,"" Greenpeace said. ""The result is a step backwards for the climate and a disservice to the European auto industry.”In contrast, the transport policy spokesman for the FDP in the European Parliament, Jan-Christoph Oetjen, called the agreement a great success, German news agency dpa reported.“The nonsensical blanket ban on the internal combustion engine is thus off the table,” he said.“We are keeping a cutting-edge technology and important jobs on the continent,"" Oetjen added.Germany's Environment Minister Steffi Lemke, a member of the Greens, said it was good that an agreement had been reached. A further impasse would have severely damaged both confidence in the European Union's procedures and Germany’s reliability in terms of European policy, she said, according to dpa.Lemke added that it was important that the automotive industry now has clarity regarding the switch to electromobility.E-fuels will play an important role, “especially for those sectors that cannot easily switch to efficient electric motors,” Lemke said.Ferdinand Dudenhoeffer, head of the CAR Center for Automotive Research in Duisburg, Germany, said the permission for e-fuels does not mean a significant change for the overall transformation to electric cars.Still, he called the late agreement between Germany and the EU “the end of a sad episode.”“The EU’s credibility has been severely damaged,” he added.",2023/03/25,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846671,Spiking violence strains sectarian ties in Iraqi province,"MUQDADIYAH, Iraq (AP) — Hussein Maytham and his family were driving past the palm tree grove near their home after a quiet evening shopping for toys for his younger cousins when their car hit a bomb planted on the moon-lit road.“I only remember the explosion,” Maytham, 16, said weakly from his hospital bed, his pale arms speckled brown by shrapnel. The attack took place earlier this month in the Shiite-majority village of Hazanieh. The force of the blast hurled the teenager out of the vehicle, but his family – his parents, an aunt and three cousins - perished in the fiery carnage. Residents say gunmen hidden nearby in irrigation canals opened fire, killing two others.This is the latest in a series of attacks witnessed over the last month in the central Iraqi province of Diyala, located north and east of Baghdad. Security officials say at least 19 civilians have been killed by unidentified assailants, including in two targeted attacks.The violence is pitting communities against each other in the ethnically and religiously diverse province. It also raises questions whether the relative calm and stability that has prevailed in much of Iraq in the years since the defeat of the extremist group Islamic State can be sustained.Iraq as a whole has moved on from the conditions that enabled the rise of the Islamic State group and the large-scale bloody sectarian violence that erupted after the U.S.-led invasion 20 years ago, according to Mohanad Adnan, a political analyst and partner at the Roya Development Group.But some parts of the country, including Diyala, remain tense, with occasional waves of violence reopening old wounds. “There are a few villages, especially in Diyala, where they have not overcome what happened in the past,” said Adnan.Officials, residents, and analysts say at least one instance of violence in Diyala appears to be a sectarian reprisal by Shiites against Sunnis over an IS-claimed attack. But they say other killings were carried out by Shiites against Shiites, as rival militias and their tribal and political allies that control the province struggle over influence and lucrative racketeering networks. Diyala, bordering both Iran and Iraq's autonomous Kurdish region, is a prime conduit for smuggling, including drugs.The Iranian-backed Badr Organization, a state-sanctioned militia within the Popular Mobilization Forces with a political wing, wrested control of the province from IS in 2015. Since then, it has asserted its dominance over several Shiite political parties and their associated paramilitaries, as well as Sunni groups.Although most Sunni residents displaced during the war against IS have returned to the province, they say they are often viewed with suspicion by authorities and neighbors due to their perceived affiliation with the extremists. When remnants of the group stage attacks on civilians or security forces, it often prompts a spiral of retaliatory attacks.In the Sunni village of Jalaylah, nine people, including women and children, were killed in a gruesome attack in late February, two months after they were blamed for allowing an IS attack on a neighboring village, according to security officials.The attackers moved openly through the area, said villager Awadh al-Azzawi. “They didn’t wear masks. Their faces were clear,” he said.Residents accuse members of the nearby Shiite village Albu Bali, where IS killed nine in December, of carrying out the attack in revenge. They say the perpetrators belong to local militias using weapons given to them by the state. Security officials affiliated with the armed groups declined to comment.Banners calling for the blood of the attackers are hoisted on the walls of Jalaylah.Maytham’s relatives less readily voice their suspicions of who killed their family members, who were Shiite.“Only God can be certain who is behind this attack,” said Sheikh Mustaf, the teenager’s grandfather, in his reception hall surrounded by guests offering their condolences for the eight killed in the March 3 attack, only describing the attackers as “terrorists.”A local leader of the Bani Tamim, one of the most prominent Shiite-majority tribes in Diyala, Sheikh Mustaf has called for calm. But tribe members say their weapons are at the ready if authorities do not bring the assailants to justice.Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani visited Diyala days after the attack, sending military reinforcements to the area. Several have been arrested on terrorism charges and caches of weapons, including mortars, missiles, and ammunition, have been uncovered, according to the security media cell.“We blame the security forces and the government because they have to secure the area. It’s their responsibility,” said Sheikh Maher, another relative of the deceased and prominent member of the tribe. He blamed “foreign hands” that he said “are trying to return our province back to the days of sectarianism and chaos.”A provincial security official, speaking to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media, said, “what is happening in Diyala is not only terrorism” – a term generally used for attacks by Sunni militant groups like IS – “but also a struggle for influence between armed factions linked to political blocs.”Experts say internal rifts are emerging within the Bani Tamim clan, who are split in their support among the competing forces of the Badr Organization, the movement of influential Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, and the Iranian-affiliated paramilitary group Asaib Ahl Al-Haq.“There is a struggle within the tribe in order to impose power and to obtain important positions in Diyala, positions in the Diyala government, and security positions,” the official said.Iraq analyst Tamer Badawi, a doctoral researcher at the University of Kent, said armed groups are also carrying out attacks to destabilize the area and undermine a crackdown launched by the government against smuggling networks that they have operated for years.“Now, after cracking down on smuggling, crime is increasing, namely murder and kidnapping for the sake of money,” said the security official.Residents of Diyala say regardless of the cause of the attack, they feel unsafe and blame Iraqi authorities for letting the attacks happen. “This is terrorism. It’s not about tribes, or sectarianism, it’s terrorism,” said Azzawi.",2023/03/25,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846696,"Pope expands sex abuse law, reaffirms adults can be victims","VATICAN CITY (AP) — Pope Francis on Saturday updated a 2019 church law aimed at holding senior churchmen accountable for covering up sexual abuse cases, expanding it to cover lay Catholic leaders and reaffirming that vulnerable adults and not just children can be victims of abuse when they are unable to freely consent.With the update, Francis made permanent temporary provisions that were passed in 2019 in a moment of crisis for the Vatican and Catholic hierarchy. The law was praised at the time for laying out precise mechanisms to investigate complicit bishops and religious superiors, even though it amounted to bishops policing fellow bishops without any requirement that civil law enforcement be informed.But implementation has been uneven, and abuse survivors have criticized the Vatican for a continued lack of transparency about the cases. Their advocates said a wholesale overhaul was necessary, not just Saturday's minor modifications.“The Catholic people were promised that (the law) would be ‘revolutionary,’ a watershed event for holding bishops accountable. But in four years, we’ve seen no significant housecleaning, no dramatic change,” said Anne Barrett Doyle, co-director of BishopAccountability.org, an online resource that has identified 40 bishops investigated globally under the new protocols.The new rules conform to other changes in the Catholic Church’s handling of abuse that were issued in the last four years. Most significantly, they are extended to cover leaders of Vatican-approved associations headed by laymen and women, not just clerics.The expansion is a response to the many cases that have come to light in recent years of lay leaders abusing their authority to sexually exploit people under their spiritual care or authority, most recently the L'Arche federation of Jean Vanier.The update also reaffirms that adults such as nuns or seminarians who are dependent on their bishops or superiors can be victims of abuse. Church law had long held that only adults who “habitually” lack the use of reason could be considered victims in the same sense as minors.The 2019 law expanded that definition and it is retained in the update, making clear that adults can be rendered vulnerable to abuse as situations present themselves. The inclusion is significant given resistance in the Vatican to the #MeToo pressure to recognize rank and file parishioners who are abused during spiritual direction by a priest as possible victims.The definition reads that a victim can be “any person in a state of infirmity, physical or mental deficiency, or deprivation of personal liberty which, in fact, even occasionally, limits their ability to understand or to want or otherwise resist the offense.”“This can be read as further manifestation of how the church cares for the frailest and weakest,” said Archbishop Filippo Iannone, prefect of the Vatican's legal office. “Anyone can be a victim, so there has to be justice. And if the victims are like these (vulnerable adults), then you must intervene to defend their dignity and liberty.""Francis originally set out the norms as a response to the decades of cover-up exposed by the 2018 Pennsylvania grand jury report and the scandal over then-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, who was eventually defrocked for abusing adults as well as minors. Francis himself was implicated in that wave of the scandal, after he dismissed claims by victims of a notorious predator in Chile.After realizing he had erred, Francis ordered up a full review of the Chilean abuse dossier, summoned the presidents of bishops' conferences to Rome for a four-day summit on safeguarding and set in motion plans for a new law to hold senior churchmen to account for abuse and cover-ups.The 2019 law and its update Saturday contain explicit standards for investigating bishops and superiors, but entrusts other bishops to do the work. It also mandates all church personnel to report allegations of clergy abuse in-house, though it doesn't mandate reporting of abuse by lay leaders and refrains from requiring any reporting to police. The new law expands whistleblower protections and reaffirms the presumption of innocence of the accused.The update makes clear each diocese must have an office to receive complaints, a more specific requirement than the original call for a mere “system,” such as an email address. The change derived from Francis' realization that many dioceses, particularly in poorer parts of the world, dragged their feet.The pope recently warned there was a “clear and present danger” of abuse in areas with fewer financial resources.“Maybe upwards of two-thirds of the bishops' conferences around the world haven’t really had the type of capacity-building and resources to implement process this in any meaningful way,"" said the Rev. Andrew Small, secretary of the pope's child protection advisory board.Survivors have long complained that the Vatican spent decades turning a blind eye to bishops and religious superiors who moved predator priests around from parish to parish rather than report them to police.The 2019 law attempted to respond to those complaints, but victims' advocates have faulted the Holy See for continued secrecy about the investigations and outcomes. The most egregious recent case concerned the secret sanctions imposed in 2021 on East Timor Bishop Carlos Ximenes Belo, a Nobel Peace Prize winner.Small agreed that abuse survivors, as well as the broader Catholic flock, must at the very least be informed of case outcomes.“Part of the process of justice, let alone healing, is the awareness that people were held accountable for their actions,” he said. ""And we’re not anywhere near where we should be on that.”",2023/03/25,,World

Hollywood star Tom Cruise was invited to its Taipei 101 restaurant to learn how to make the xiaolongbao during a visit to Taiwan to promote a movie in 2013.Yang was born in the Chinese province of Shanxi in 1927, and made his way on a ship from Shanghai to Taiwan during the civil war in 1948, UDN reported. He founded a cooking oil business 10 years later, but the advent of salad oil in metal tins in 1972 forced him into a radical change of course.Yang and his wife followed the advice of a businessman and devoted half of their cooking oil store on Xinyi Road to selling steamed buns. The food was so successful that they decided to abandon the cooking oil business for good.His relatives did not mention the date and cause of death, but said the funeral arrangements would be low key.",2023/03/25,5841,Society
