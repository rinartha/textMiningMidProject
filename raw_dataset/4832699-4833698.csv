https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4832750,Taiwan must prepare for impending propaganda tsunami,"TAICHUNG (Taiwan News) — Several technologies will soon converge, unleashing massive torrents of high-quality, hard-to-spot propaganda and disinformation. Taiwan will be ground zero, and it will most likely happen in 2023, during the election campaign.Taiwan already faces a large volume of propaganda and disinformation. The Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) United Front Work Department (UFWD) has been actively targeting Taiwan for some time, and Taiwan is widely seen as ground zero and the testing ground for UFWD activities.Financial Times reported during the 2020 national election cycle that reporters for both the Taiwanese news outlets Want Want China Times newspaper and CTiTV news received instructions directly from China’s Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO). These revelations led to abusive libel lawsuits against prominent journalist Kathrin Hille, though in the end they were fortunately dropped. CTiTV was eventually taken off cable TV, giving over half their entire news coverage to the then China-favored KMT presidential candidate Daniel Han Kuo-yu (韓國瑜), but China Times is still operating normally and CTiTV is now on Youtube.Websites, social media pages, and content farms spreading Chinese propaganda are chronic problems. Hackers have taken over websites and social media accounts, and even briefly took over display screens at 7-11s and Taiwan Railway Administration stations.There are armies of “50-centers” (aka “wumao”) who are said to be paid a half Renminbi for posts, and unpaid nationalistic “little pinks” that roam social media and comment sections spouting aggressive Chinese nationalism. Bot accounts on social media clumsily spread propaganda and together form the so-called “internet water army” that floods and overwhelms social media pages, such as that of Taiwan’s president and premier.However, up to now, all these efforts have been fairly crude, highly labor-intensive, and usually easy to spot. Only a relatively small number of methods actually work, and usually only with people already inclined to the propaganda.That being said, the sheer volume keeps praiseworthy civil society groups like Doublethink Lab and the recently created Ministry of Digital Affairs (MODA) very busy, and they are about to get significantly busier.Artificial intelligence (AI) tools like ChatGPT are set to take off in China, with Baidu set to release their Chinese version in March. The UFWD will certainly get their hands on the technology, tweaked for their requirements.This type of AI can write passable articles and even entire books with limited prompts very quickly, opening the floodgates to fill fake news sites and social media accounts with an unimaginable volume of content.Previously, each person could write one or two articles per day. Now people will be able to pump out articles in a minute or less, with the only limitation being coming up with enough prompts and topics to feed the AI to keep the articles flowing.The tools will likely overwhelm any fact checkers, moderators, and other defenses. The sheer volume will also make it more likely that they will dominate search engine results for all sorts of keywords and phrases, crowd out legitimate journalism and academic papers, and clog results with propaganda to their liking.This is concerning, as search engines are still our main go-to to find information. Worse, AI platforms like ChatGPT produce their results based on combing through the internet. While ChatGPT only has data up to 2021, Bing search is already testing its own without limitation, and ChatGPT will no doubt follow.This could lead to both search engines and AI platforms being corrupted by UFWD propaganda and inadvertently doing their bidding. Both must do some serious thinking and planning to avoid this happening.This is going to be linked with another AI development. Just recently, reporters at the Guardian, Le Monde, and Der Spiegel conducted an undercover investigation that found a service being offered out of Israel called Advanced Impact Media Solutions (Aims) that can manage over 30,000 social media accounts across many platforms.These companies use avatars with a “multifaceted digital backstory” and the “avatars mimicked human behavior and their posts were powered by artificial intelligence.” In short, an AI-powered system is exponentially more powerful than the rather crude systems that create Twitter bots today, and it’s only a matter of time before the UFWD gets its hands on it, or something similar.AI is also going to create the ultimate monster, realistic deepfake videos that can, once fed a certain amount of video and audio (say from news clips) of a person, can recreate the image of that person and get that digital copy to say and do whatever they like. Deepfakes take a lot of work to create, and it has to be done by a person, but that’s about to change.In just a few days, ChatGPT will be launching a video version. Of course, it will no doubt have plenty of safeguards against creating deepfakes, but the UFWD is almost certainly working on getting their hands on this technology.Once they do, they can flood the internet with fake videos, having politicians or whomever they like either parroting their propaganda, or saying or doing something outrageous. It is not hard to see how this could be extremely damaging in a political campaign.Most likely these tools will be used to undermine the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in order to get more China-friendly candidates elected. The DPP will need to think of a strategy to deal with this.",2023/03/12,1907,Opinion

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4832815,Fencing to allow Russians and Belarusians back into competition,"The International Fencing Federation (FIE) has voted to overturn a ban on Russian and Belarusian fencers competing in its events, paving the way for them to qualify for next year's Paris Olympics.The decision, following a ballot of FIE members at an extraordinary congress meeting, makes fencing just the second sport after judo to follow the recommendations of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). In January, the IOC said it is exploring a ""pathway"" for athletes from Russia and its ally Belarus to compete as neutrals in Paris, without their flags or anthems.The IOC cites their human rights, saying no athlete should be discriminated against because of their passport. But many countries have condemned the organization's plans as being premature when Russia's war in Ukraine is still raging.In an interview with DW, Lea Krüger, a German national team fencer, expressed her misgivings about the FIE's decision.""I was completely disappointed by the federation and by the sports system in general,"" she said. ""Nobody ever cares about the athletes. None of these organizations take responsibility for their decisions. And now we have the situation where I will be on the piste [the strip on which fencers compete] with a Russian athlete, and I have to decide how to act. In the end it's on us, the athletes, to take responsibility for something we never decided. It's a mess.""The FIE didn't publish any information about its decision, but Britain's fencing federation wrote on its website that the vote had passed by a majority of 2 to 1. It quoted the FIE as saying that the participation of Russian and Belarusian fencers from mid-April would be ""subject to possible future IOC recommendations/decisions, and in compliance with conditions of neutrality and individual eligibility.""However, Paris hopeful Krüger says both the FIE and the IOC have failed to define what neutrality actually means, and how it can be guaranteed.""The neutrality we had in previous years with Russia [during the country's doping bans] was not a clear neutrality,"" she said. ""There have to be stronger rules. The IOC has to show now how real neutrality can work.""Ukraine is among a group of countries, including Poland and the Baltic states, to have threatened a boycott if Russians and Belarusians are allowed in Paris. In a sport like fencing, where athletes compete at close quarters, Ukrainians could come face to face with Russians who have direct links to the military, such as being members of the army club, CSKA Moscow.""What about the Ukrainian athletes? How will they react in competitions, how will they deal with this situation?"" Krüger asked. ""They are completely alone now.""Until last year, the FIE's president and main donor was Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov. He left his position when the war broke out, as did Stanislav Pozdnyakov, who headed the European Fencing Confederation. Pozdnyakov is also the president of the Russian Olympic Committee; his daughter, Sofia, is a Russian fencer.For Krüger, the FIE's decision shows the influence that Russia has on her sport, and fencing's ties to the IOC, whose president, Thomas Bach, is a former Olympic fencer.""It was clear that fencing would be one of the first sports for the Russians to come back,"" she said. ""Usmanov gives a lot of money to the federation. We do not have big sponsors in fencing, so we are really dependent on him for money. And so, you see the connection between sports politics, fencing and Russia is very intense.""Meanwhile, Russian Sofya Velikaya, a five-time Olympic medalist in fencing, welcomed the decision in comments reported by TASS, the country's state news agency.""I believed that this should happen, and I want to thank colleagues from different countries who voted for our return,"" Velikaya said. ""Sport should provide equal rights and conditions, and common sense finally prevailed.""The president of Germany's fencing federation, Claudia Bokel, said the vote was based on ""geopolitics,"" adding: ""The result that all athletes are allowed to participate again could be a sign of further voting in the sports world in the coming weeks.""It could also spell problems for Germany. The country is set to host a World Cup event in May, and it is unclear whether fencers from Russia and Belarus will be allowed to enter Germany to take part.""The German Fencing Federation is now awaiting an enquiry from the [FIE] as to whether the entry of Russian and Belarusian fencers into Germany can be guaranteed,"" it wrote in a statement. ""Otherwise, we would probably be threatened with the withdrawal of international fencing events from Germany.""Edited by: Matt Pearson",2023/03/12,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4832816,Ukraine updates: Russia shields its wealthy cities from war,"The British Ministry of Defence says the impact of Russia's war in Ukraine varies dramatically from region to region with the biggest and richest cities relatively unscathed.Relative to their populations, the two largest cities of Moscow and St. Petersburg have not seen particularly high levels of casualties in terms of soldiers deployed to the front, the ministry said in its daily intelligence report on Sunday.It added that the low casualty rates were ""especially true for the families of the country's elite.""""Russian senior officials were photographed making up the front two rows of the audience of President Putin's state of the nation speech on February 23,"" the ministry said. ""None of these are known to have children serving in the military.""Meanwhile, in Russia's eastern regions, deaths are likely running, as a percentage of the population, at a rate more than 30 times higher than in Moscow.Ethnic minorities take the ""biggest hit,"" the report said. ""In Astrakhan [in southwest Russia], some 75% of casualties come from the minority Kazakh and Tartar population,"" the ministry explained.It predicted that, as Russia looks to address its continued deficit of combat personnel, ""insulating the better-off and more influential elements of Russian society will highly likely remain a major consideration.""Here are some of the other notable developments concerning the war on Sunday, March 12:The Ukrainian foreign minister has urged Germany to speed up its supply of ammunition and to begin training Ukrainian pilots in Western fighter jets.Dmytro Kuleba told Germany's Bild am Sonntag newspaper that the main difficulty Ukraine had in repelling Russian invasion forces was a shortage of ammunition, and that bureaucracy in Berlin was partly to blame.The minister said German weapons manufacturers told him last month at the Munich Security Conference they could deliver, but that they were waiting for the government to sign contracts.""So the problem lies with the government,"" Kuleba was quoted as saying.Kuleba was clear in saying he did not expect Western allies in the near future to give Ukraine the fighter jets it has been asking for.However, the minister said Ukrainian pilots should be trained anyway, so they would be ready once that decision was taken.For Germany to train Ukrainian pilots, it would be a ""clear message of its political engagement"", he said.Separately, Kuleba said Ukraine would keep defending the town of Bakhmut, which has been the focus of a Russian offensive for the last six months.""If we withdrew from Bakhmut, what would that change? Russia would take Bakhmut and then continue its offensive against Chasiv Yar, so every town behind Bakhmut could suffer the same fate,"" the minister said.Russian lawmakers want to crack down harder on individuals who criticize Russian forces fighting against Ukraine. How will these legal changes impact Russia's society?The Russian mercenary group is now in control of most of the front-line town of Bakhmut's eastern part, according to British intelligence. Meanwhile, Russian shelling killed three civilians in the Kherson region. Catch up on Saturday's Ukraine updates here.Before the Russian invasion, more than 70,000 people lived in Bakhmut. Now, a fierce battle is raging for the Donbas city. Not all civilians have left. A picture of life in Bakhmut, below.rc/fb (dpa, Reuters, AFP, AP)",2023/03/12,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4832829,Moldova says it foiled Russia-back plot to stir unrest,"Moldovan police said on Sunday they had thwarted an effort by Russian-backed agents who were seeking to cause mass unrest at protests organized by the political opposition.In recent weeks, the political party of fugitive pro-Russian oligarch Ilhan Shor has sought to mobilize followers against the former Soviet republic's pro-European government.The Moldovan police said they had arrested members of a network ""orchestrated by Moscow"" to destabilize the country ahead of an anti-government protest on Sunday.Police chief Viorel Cernauteanu told media that 25 men had been questioned and seven of them detained.The group was led by a Moldovan-Russian, he said, adding that it had been infiltrated and the prosecution had recorded 10 hours of video and audio.The group included ""diversionists,"" some Russian citizens, who had been promised $10,000 (€9,380) to organize ""mass disorder,"" according to the police.""People came from Russia with a very specific training role,"" Cernauteanu said.Moldovan authorities said they acted after ""receiving information on the organization by Russian special services of destabilizing actions on our territory via demonstrations.""Several protests have been held in recent weeks by the Movement for the People group, which is demanding that the government fully cover the costs of winter fuel bills and that it should ""not involve the country in war.""The group — which is backed by the Russia-friendly Shor Party — has also repeatedly called for pro-European President Maia Sandu to step down.The leader of the Shor Party, which holds six seats in Moldova's 101-seat legislature, is currently in exile in Israel. Shor, a Moldovan oligarch, is implicated in a $1 billion bank theft and was recently named as working for Russian interests on a US State Department sanctions list.Border police in the country of some 2.6 million people on Sunday said that 182 foreign nationals had been denied entry into Moldova in the past week. They included a ""possible representative"" of Russia's private military Wagner Group, which is currently involved in much of the fighting in neighboring Ukraine.Moldova's national anti-corruption agency said a day earlier that it had seized more than €220,000 euros in a case of alleged illegal financing of the Shor Party by an organized crime group.Officials said car searches of party ""couriers"" had found cash in various currencies stuffed into envelopes and bags. The agency said the money was set aside to ""pay for the transport and remunerate people who come to the protests organized by the party.""Separately, police on Sunday said they had detained 54 protesters who exhibited ""questionable behavior"" or were found to be carrying prohibited items, including a knife.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy last month said Kyiv had intercepted intelligence indicating that Moscow plotted ""to break the democracy of Moldova and establish control over Moldova.""Wedged between Ukraine and Romania, Moldova is militarily neutral but, since last year, has official candidate status to become a member of the European Union.The Kremlin has sought to keep post-Soviet states such as Ukraine and Moldova within its sphere of influence, although both countries have pivoted toward the West.Russia still has considerable influence in Moldova, particularly in the eastern breakaway region of Moldova, Trans-Dniester, where Moscow maintains a military presence. Although The Kremlin officially refers to its force of some  there as peacekeepers, they support Moscow-aligned separatists active there.Trans-Dniester seceded from Moldova after the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, with pro-Russian separatists fighting against Moldovan government forces.rc/fb (AFP, AP)",2023/03/12,150,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4832892,Ballard Power Test Drives First Hydrogen LCVs,"Vancouver, British Columbia -  Newsfile Corp. - March 10, 2023 - First Hydrogen Corp. (TSXV: FHYD) (OTC Pink: FHYDF) (FSE: FIT) (""FIRST HYDROGEN"" or the ""Company"") welcomed Ballard Power Systems (""Ballard"") to test drive its first-generation zero emission light commercial vehicle (""LCV"") at AVL Powertrain's engineering facility in Basildon, UK. Ballard partnered with First Hydrogen to develop these first-of-their-kind hydrogen powered LCVs. The two Generation I vehicles use a combination of Ballard's latest LCS fuel cell stack and First Hydrogen's proprietary technology.   The First Hydrogen vehicles will be deployed with major fleet operators that have already enrolled to drive the hydrogen zero-emission LCV's. One of the UK's largest fleet operators will start the test drive process imminently. A total of 15 major fleet operators have registered to participate as part of the UK Aggregated Hydrogen Freight Consortium (""AHFC""). The trials give commercial operators from a range of sectors – including grocery, express delivery, utilities, and roadside assistance – the opportunity to test hydrogen-powered-fuel-cell electric vehicles alongside their existing fleets and compare different technologies.   The Generation I vehicles act as proof of concept and enable fleet operators, refuelling services and prospective customers to test fuel cell vehicles in real-world conditions. The LCVs are currently undergoing vehicle evaluation and mileage accumulation, which will support optimised vehicle efficiency. The data collected enables First Hydrogen to accurately calculate fuel consumption and vehicle range under different driving conditions and inform future vehicle development.   Importantly, the findings enable the Company to provide total cost of ownership (""TCO"") data to prospective customers. Ballard's LCS fuel cell stack technology was chosen for its maximum performance and lifetime durability, which helps to further optimise TCO and make the transition to zero emission vehicles financially competitive. To support the move to net zero, First Hydrogen is also developing an end-to-end 'Hydrogen-as-a-Service' solution, providing fleets with green hydrogen fuel, fleet aftercare and zero emission vehicles.   The global LCV market is projected to reach USD 751.86 billion by 2030, increasing at a compound annual growth rate of 5.1% during the forecast period (2022-2030). To meet the market's need to achieve emissions targets and to capitalise on improving zero emission infrastructure, First Hydrogen is leading the change in the LCV sector with functional, clean fleet solutions.   David Mucciacciaro, CCO at Ballard Power Systems, commented: ""We were pleased to experience First Hydrogen's LCV first-hand and delighted to see how our leading fuel cell technology performs on the road in a light-duty application. Our plans to expand Ballard's fuel cell production will enable the scale-up of the fuel cell market as we see continued investment and customer interest.""   Robert Campbell, CEO of First Hydrogen Energy, added: ""Our close working relationship with Ballard has played a key role in developing First Hydrogen's first generation of zero-emission LCVs. This was Ballard's first visit to see the vans and we were keen for their team to see the vehicles in action before they enter our key fleet trial programme in the coming weeks.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4832905,Princeton rallies to beat Harvard and win Ivy Tournament,"PRINCETON, N.J. (AP) — It hasn't been the easiest of seasons for Princeton. The Tigers lost the first two games of conference play for the first time in six years and were looking up at the rest of an Ivy League which they have dominated over the last few seasons.The Tigers turned things around and didn't lose in the conference again, reeling off 14 straight wins and now are back in a familiar place — the NCAA Tournament.Kaitlyn Chen scored 21 points, Ellie Mitchell had four in the final 78 seconds and the Tigers came back from an 11-point third quarter deficit to beat Harvard 54-48 and win the Ivy League Tournament on Saturday.“It's full circle that we started with a loss at Harvard and finished with a big win against a really great program,” Princeton coach Carla Berube said. “We started at the bottom in late December and kept climbing. And now we're at the peak with the regular season and the tournament (championships).”It had been that kind of season for the Tigers (23-5), who earned a second straight trip to the NCAA Tournament. Princeton knocked off sixth-seeded Kentucky in the first round and lost by a point to Indiana in the round of 32 last year.“We want to be in the Sweet 16,” Chen said. “We’ll use that and hopefully push us into the next round.”The Tigers have actually won four straight Ivy championships dating back to 2018. The league didn't have a postseason tournament in 2020 and didn't play in 2021 because of the coronavirus.Trailing 48-47 with 1:18 left Mitchell hit a layup with the shot clock running down. After a off-balance runner by Harmoni Turner missed, Mitchell got the rebound and calmly sank two free throws with 37.2 seconds left. Mitchell had 10 points and 15 rebounds.Elena Rodriguez was fouled 10 seconds later for Harvard, but she missed both free throws. Chen then missed two on the other end with 23.7 seconds left leaving the door open for the Crimson (17-11), who were trying to earn their first trip to the NCAA Tournament since 2007.Harvard couldn't take advantage though as Turner turned the ball over on a drive down the lane, throwing it out of bounds.Madison St. Rose hit the second of two free throws to make it a two-possession game. McKenzie Forbes missed a 3-pointer on the other end and the Tigers celebrated hugging at center court to the delight of their home fans after St. Rose hit two more free throws for the final margin.Forbes finished with 16 points to lead Harvard, which beat Columbia in overtime to advance to the title game.Harvard trailed 18-15 after the first quarter as Chen, who was the Ivy League Player of the Year, scored 13 points for the Tigers. The Crimson got going in the second quarter outscoring Princeton 17-5, including scoring the final nine points of the half. Lola Mullaney hit a 3-pointer just before the buzzer to give Harvard its biggest lead of the half at 32-23.The Crimson extended the lead to 42-31 with 5:56 left in the third quarter before Princeton scored the next six points and trailed 44-37 heading into the fourth quarter.The Tigers started pressing in the fourth quarter, using a 1-2-2 that bothered Harvard. Princeton tied the game before Rodriguez hit one of two free throws with 1:18 left to give Harvard a 48-47 lead — its last.“Their 1-2-2 bothered us, 17-4 in the fourth quarter, you don’t win championships like that.” Harvard coach Carrie Moore said. “ l thought we learned what it requires to come out of here with a win. We still have some growing up to do. These girls have worked tremendously hard to walk away a champion and it hurts not to do that.”___AP women’s college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/womens-college-basketball and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/13,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4832906,"Leonard scores 38, leads Clippers to 106-95 win over Knicks","LOS ANGELES (AP) — Kawhi Leonard scored 38 points and the Los Angeles Clippers pulled away in the fourth quarter for a 106-95 victory over the New York Knicks on Saturday.Paul George added 22 points for the Clippers, who have won their last three games after dropping five straight.“It feels good to be on a winning streak and play well,"" coach Tyronn Lue said. “I knew we made some changes (near last month's trade deadline) and it was going to take time. We have played well in some of those earlier games and not get the win.”It was Leonard's seventh straight game with at least 21 points, and he's averaging 31 points during that stretch. He also has four 30-point games during that span.“I got some open looks in the third quarter,"" said Leonard, who scored 19 in the third quarter, including three 3-pointers. ""You know, started off attacking the basket, ended up getting that and-one. And then from there, just shot the ball with confidence.""Besides Leonard's hot play, the other difference the past two games has been the Clippers playing better defense. New York shot 32 of 90 from the field, marking the first time this season the Clippers have held teams under 40% in two straight games.“I think when Kawhi and PG are locking into the other teams best players and taking that challenge, when they’re playing at a high level defensively,"" Lue said, “you know we’re a different team.”Immanuel Quickley had 26 points and 10 rebounds for the Knicks, who have dropped three straight after a nine-game winning streak. Quickley started in place of Jalen Brunson, who was sidelined with a sore left foot.Julius Randle scored 19 despite shooting 5 of 24.“I thought we played really well in the first half and for the most part played well in the third quarter, I didn't like the way we started the fourth, and right now our margin of error is small,” Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said. “We've got to understand that the intensity of the fourth quarter is different. So be ready to handle that.”New York had a 74-73 lead late in the third quarter before the Clippers scored nine straight points to take control.The run started when Randle was assessed a technical foul with 0.3 seconds remaining after he elbowed Clippers center Mason Plumlee in the face while both were going for a rebound.Leonard tied it by making the technical shot and Plumlee converted the next two free throws to give the Clippers a 76-74 advantage going into the final 12 minutes.Los Angeles extended their lead to 14 with less than four minutes remaining in the fourth.TRAINER'S ROOMThibodeau said Brunson is day-to-day and X-rays were negative.Brunson has missed three of the past four games after being injured during a win on March 3 over Miami.“We definitely miss having him on the floor, but we've got to figure it out and figure out how to get these wins,"" guard RJ Barrett said. ""We will figure it out somehow, you know what I mean, try to get easier wins and stay like that.”RECORD BOOKRussell Westbrook passed Isiah Thomas for ninth on the NBA’s career assists list. Westbrook has 9,062 during his 15-year career.“It’s great as a point guard like myself, the different conversations that I’ve had to overcome over my career to be on this side of it. It’s a special thing,"" Westbrook said.TIP-INSKnicks: Mitchell Robinson had 14 rebounds, including eight on the offensive end. ... Trailed for most of the first half but had a 49-47 lead at halftime after Randle made three free throws with 2.6 seconds remaining after being fouled by Marcus Morris Sr.Clippers: Morris had 11 points, including three 3-pointers. ... George, who also had eight rebounds and eight assists, went over 2,000 3-pointers in his career during the second quarter.UP NEXTKnicks: Remain in Los Angeles to face the Lakers on Sunday.Clippers: Host Golden State on Wednesday.___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/13,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4832908,Utah Royals to return next season as NWSL's 13th team,"The Royals are returning to Utah and the National Women's Soccer League.The NWSL and Major League Soccer's Real Salt Lake announced the second iteration of the Utah Royals on Saturday. The Royals were part of the NWSL for three seasons from 2018 to 2020.“When we acquired Real Salt Lake last year, we said it was a matter of when, not if, the NWSL would return to Utah. This has always been an integral part of our mission,” RSL co-owner David Blitzer said in a statement.Michelle Hyncik, RSL’s general counsel, was named president of the Royals. America First Credit Union will be the team’s jersey sponsor.When FC Kansas City, one of the NWSL's founding clubs, folded in 2017, its players were transferred to a new team in Utah owned by Dell Loy Hansen, who also owned Real Salt Lake. The original Royals folded in 2020 after Hansen relinquished ownership of both clubs.In an interview with a local radio station, Hansen had criticized MLS players for supporting the Black Lives Matter movement and for protesting the August 2020 shooting by police of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin. In the fallout from Hansen's remarks, he announced he would sell.Chris and Angie Long, co-founders of Kansas-based Palmer Square Capital Management, acquired the Royals in late 2020 and moved the team back to Kansas City.The sale of the original Royals stipulated that the buyers of Real Salt Lake would have rights to a future NWSL expansion franchise for a set fee. Early last year, MLS approved the sale of RSL to Blitzer, whose Global Football Holdings has stakes in the NBA’s Philadelphia 76ers and the NHL's New Jersey Devils among other teams, and Ryan Smith’s Smith Entertainment Group, which also owns the NBA’s Utah Jazz.“This is going to be an epic moment for the state,” Smith said Saturday. “And it’s going to be a moment where I personally believe that there has been a massive hole in our community as far as professional women’s sports and an opportunity for for my young girls -- I’ve got three young girls — to be able to look up and say, ’Hey, well, there’s another option here and it’s not just about sports. It’s about leadership.'”Blitzer is expected to represent the team at the NWSL’s Board of Governors.Real Salt Lake announced the return of the Royals at a press conference ahead of the MLS team's home opener againstThe NWSL is expected to add another team for 2024, bringing the league to 14 teams. A future team in Boston is also planned.The Royals' short first tenure in the league was tainted by controversy. Coach Craig Harrington was put on paid administrative leave in September 2020 and later dismissed for allegedly making inappropriate comments.The allegations were detailed in the NWSL's report on a league-wide investigation into abuse and misconduct released in December. Harrington denied the reports.NWSL Commissioner Jessica Berman said in July that the league would consider a state's stand on reproductive rights in awarding expansion franchises.Utah has near-total abortion ban that was triggered when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, but it is currently blocked by a restraining order.Berman said Saturday that the Royals share the NWSL's values.“It’s something that we look at not only for expansion teams, but for our incumbent teams. And we have various markets where women’s health and medical rights and resources are compromised and limited that it’s our responsibility at the league office to the extent permitted by law to provide tools and resources for our players to have their medical needs met,” Berman said. “We have those safety nets and systems in place through the league office where players can have their medical needs addressed even if they have to leave the market and we are here to support them to the extent that’s necessary. And we know that the ownership group here is aligned to ensure that that’s the case.""___AP freelance writer Matthew Coles in Sandy, Utah, contributed to this report.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/13,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4832911,Jayhawks hope to have Bill Self back for NCAA title defense,"KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — Kansas hopes to have Hall of Fame basketball coach Bill Self, who missed the entire Big 12 Tournament after a medical procedure earlier week, back on the sideline when it begins its NCAA Tournament title defense next week.Norm Roberts, who led the third-ranked Jayhawks to the championship game Saturday night, said that Self talked to his team before its 76-56 loss to seventh-ranked Texas and anticipates joining them for Selection Sunday.“We plan on him coaching next week,” Roberts said. “He's doing well.”It remains unclear what caused the 60-year-old Self to visit the emergency room Wednesday night, nor what kind of procedure took place. Dr. Steve Stites, the chief medical officer at the University of Kansas Health System, only would say that Self did not have a heart attack, as some outlets had reported, and is expected to make a full recovery.Roberts led the Jayhawks to four wins to start the season, while Self was serving a school-imposed four-game suspension, and guided them to tourney wins over West Virginia and Iowa State before the loss to the Longhorns.“We’ve got a great staff,” the Jayhawks’ Dajuan Harris Jr. said. “Coach Self trusts them a lot, and we trust them too.”Still, it's hard to replace one of college basketball's winningest coaches.Self is 581-130 during his two decades with Kansas, and 788-235 in his 30 seasons as a head coach, which includes stops at Oral Roberts, Tulsa and Illinois. He’s led the Jayhawks to a pair of national titles, beating Memphis in 2008 and North Carolina last April, and the regular-season Big 12 title was his 17th in 20 seasons in Lawrence.“Hopefully, we’ll see him tomorrow for Selection Sunday,” Harris said in a mostly empty Kansas locker room Saturday night. ""Coach Rob did a great for us this whole week, but Coach Self, we trust him to lead us.”___AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/college-basketball and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/13,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4832912,No. 7 Texas rolls past No. 3 Kansas 76-56 for Big 12 title,"KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — The players flooded off the Texas bench, right past interim coach Rodney Terry and to the middle of the court inside T-Mobile Center, where they couldn't wait to get their hands on the trophy crowning them Big 12 champions.After the season they had, who could blame them?It began under the darkest of clouds with their high-profile coach, Chris Beard, fired following a domestic incident. Terry was given the job and the tall task of guiding the Longhorns through a grueling schedule, and what many have called one of the toughest conferences in college basketball history.But after finishing second to Kansas in the regular season, the seventh-ranked Longhorns proved Saturday night they were champs in their own right, blowing out the third-ranked Jayhawks 76-56 in the Big 12 finals.Dylan Disu overcame early foul trouble to score 18 points and was tournament MVP. Marcus Carr and Sir'Jabari Rice, who also landed on the all-tournament team, had 17 apiece. And just about everyone wearing burnt orange had a hand in shutting down the Jayhawks, who were trying to win a second straight tournament title.“There probably hasn't been a team challenged as much in terms of adversity or staying the course,” Terry said, his voice long gone hoarse. “There was no nights off. This tournament, we knew, was going to be tough as well, but we were excited about it, and these guys’ approach and their attitudes — they wanted to be champions, and they made it happen.”After going more than two decades without a Big 12 tourney title, the Longhorns (26-8) have won two of the past three, and likely wrapped up a No. 2 seed in next week's NCAA Tournament with their performance in Kansas City.“You only take this win for one night,” said Brock Cunningham, who was on that 2021 title team that was then bounced in the first round of the NCAA tourney. “We'll have this win tonight and then we'll get back to work.”The Jayhawks played once again without Hall of Fame coach Bill Self, who went to the emergency room on the eve of their quarterfinal for an undisclosed medical procedure. Self's longtime assistant and acting coach, Norm Roberts, said afterward that he hopes to have Self back when they begin defense of their NCAA title next week.Jalen Wilson scored 24 points and Joseph Yesufu, pressed into the starting lineup due to injuries, finished with 11 for the Jayhawks (27-7), who had won 13 of their previous 16 trips to the Big 12 finals.The question now is whether the defending national champs did enough before Saturday night to earn the overall No. 1 seed for the NCAA Tournament, and with it a favorable road through Kansas City in the regional round.“Give Texas a lot of credit. They played really well,” Roberts said. “They're very athletic; we knew that. Fast. They have some really good offensive players. I thought we did a good job early in the game, but then we missed a bunch of bunnies, easy shots and putbacks that could have kept us in the game, and then I think fatigue took over.”Both teams were missing starters Saturday night due to injuries — Kevin McCullar Jr. for the Jayhawks, Timmy Allen for the Longhorns — yet there was still plenty of star power on display inside T-Mobile Center.Wilson, the league's player of the year, kept the Jayhawks afloat during a scattershot first half. He scored 17 points, more than half their total, while pounding the glass and even picking up a steal.Texas, meanwhile, relied on depth and balance in forging a 39-33 halftime lead. It had to after losing Disu, a revelation in the previous two rounds, to a pair of fouls less than eight minutes into the game.“Everybody on the court was doing their part,” Carr said later, “cutting, moving, knocking down shots.”When Disu returned, the big man went right to work. He had a couple of baskets in the opening minutes, and a nearly five-minute drought by Kansas allowed the Longhorns to extend their lead to 53-41 with 12 minutes to go.By that point, about 500 Texas fans sounded like 15,000. And about 15,000 Kansas fans were dead silent.The knockout blow came moments later, when Disu's baskets bookended one by Rice, and Arterio Morris added an ally-oop dunk. That pushed the Longhorns' lead to 70-50 with 4 1/2 minutes to go, and while Roberts finally called a timeout to slow the onslaught, it came far too late to make a difference.“I don't think we really thought about the game was over at any point,” Rice said. “We just kept playing, and whatever the outcome was going to be when the buzzer sounded, that's what we cared about.”MISSING STARTERSMcCullar, the Jayhawks' defensive dynamo, has been dealing with back spasms that flared up again during a semifinal win over Iowa State; he watched from the bench in sweats. The Longhorns were without Allen all tournament while the veteran leader rested a lower leg injury ahead of the NCAA Tournament.THE TAKEAWAYTexas shot 50% from the field but was especially good inside the arc — the Longhorns were just 4 of 17 on 3s. And rarely did they go more than a couple of minutes without a basket, preventing Kansas from getting its crowd into the game.Kansas was forced to use some different lineups with McCullar out, playing freshman MJ Rice extra minutes. The Jayhawks rarely seemed in sync, and that was evident in Dajuan Harris Jr. turning the ball over an uncharacteristic four times.UP NEXTThe Longhorns and Jayhawks are headed to the NCAA Tournament. They'll learn Sunday night who, when and where they will play in the first round.___AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/college-basketball and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/13,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4832915,"Storm breaches California river's levee, thousands evacuate","WATSONVILLE, Calif. (AP) — A Northern California agricultural community famous for its strawberry crop was forced to evacuate early Saturday after the Pajaro River’s levee was breached by flooding from a new atmospheric river that pummeled the state.Across the Central Coast's Monterey County, more than 8,500 people were under evacuation orders and warnings Saturday, including roughly 1,700 residents — many of them Latino farmworkers — from the unincorporated community of Pajaro.Officials said the Pajaro River's levee breach is about 100 feet (30.48 meters) wide. Crews had gone door to door Friday afternoon to urge residents to leave before the rains came but some stayed and had to be pulled from floodwaters early Saturday.First responders and the California National Guard rescued more than 50 people overnight. One video showed a member of the Guard helping a driver out of a car trapped by water up to their waists.“We were hoping to avoid and prevent this situation, but the worst case scenario has arrived with the Pajaro River overtopping and levee breaching at about midnight,"" wrote Luis Alejo, chair of the Monterey County Board of Supervisors, on Twitter.Alejo called the flooding “massive,” saying the damage will take months to repair.The Pajaro River separates the counties of Santa Cruz and Monterey in the area that flooded Saturday. Floodwaters that got into the region’s wells might be contaminated with chemicals, officials said, and residents were told not to drink or cook with tap water for fear of illness.Officials had been working along the levee in the hopes of shoring it up when it was breached around midnight Friday into Saturday. Crews began working to fix the levee around daybreak Saturday as residents slept in evacuation centers.Oliver Gonzalez, 12, told The Associated Press that he, his mother and his aunt were rescued around 5 a.m. Saturday in Parajo. He grabbed his laptop, cellphone and some important documents but so much was left behind in their rush to leave.“I’m kinda scared,"" he said several hours later from an evacuation center in nearby Watsonville. ""My mom’s car was left in the water.”Anais Rodriguez, 37, said first responders knocked on her home's door shortly after midnight. Her family packed about four days' worth of clothing and drove out to safety. She and her two children, her husband and her parents — along with their dog, Mila — arrived at the shelter about an hour later with few answers about what this would mean for their community going forward.Weather-related power outages affected more than 17,000 customers in Monterey County late Saturday, according to the Governor's Office of Emergency Services.Gov. Gavin Newsom's office on Saturday said it was monitoring the situation in Pajaro.“Our thoughts are with everyone impacted and the state has mobilized to support the community,” the governor's office wrote on Twitter.The Pajaro Valley is a coastal agricultural area known for growing strawberries, apples, cauliflower, broccoli and artichokes. National brands like Driscoll’s Strawberries and Martinelli’s are headquartered in the region.In 1995, the Pajaro River's levees broke, submerging 2,500 acres (1,011 hectares) of farmland and the community of Pajaro. Two peopled died and the flooding caused nearly $100 million in damage. A state law, passed last year, advanced state funds for a levee project. It was scheduled to start construction in 2024.State Sen. John Laird, who spearheaded the law and represents the area, said the project is fully funded now but it just came down to bad timing with this year's rains.“It’s tragic, we were so close to getting this done before any storms,” he said.This week's storm marked the state’s 10th atmospheric river of the winter, storms that have brought enormous amounts of rain and snow to the state and helped lessen the drought conditions that had dragged on for three years. State reservoirs that had dipped to strikingly low levels are now well above the average for this time of year, prompting state officials to release water from dams to assist with flood control and make room for even more rain.Across the state on Saturday, Californians contended with drenching rains and rising water levels in the atmospheric river's aftermath. In Tulare County, the sheriff ordered residents who live near the Tule River to evacuate, while people near the Poso Creek in Kern County were under an evacuation warning. The National Weather Service's meteorologists issued flood warnings and advisories, begging motorists to stay off deluged roadways.In San Francisco, an 85-foot (25.91 meter) eucalyptus tree fell onto the Trocadero Clubhouse early Saturday morning. The 1892 clubhouse, a San Francisco historical landmark, was left severely damaged, with part of the roof crushed and the inside flooded.Funnel clouds were spotted in the Jamestown area — the heart of California's Gold Rush — on Saturday afternoon and the weather service issued a tornado warning — later canceled — for the Sierra Nevada foothills as severe thunderstorms, hail and high winds blanketed the region. Another set of tornado warnings were briefly issued in Fresno Count y, nearly 100 miles (160.93 kilometers) south of Gold Country. Flash flooding warnings were in effect late Saturday in Tuolumne County, with roads submerged around Sonora and neighboring communities.There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage.Newsom has declared emergencies in 34 counties in recent weeks, and the Biden administration approved a presidential disaster declaration for some on Friday morning, a move that will bring more federal assistance. President Biden spoke with Newsom on Saturday to pledge the federal government's support in California's response to the emergency, the White House said.The atmospheric river, known as a “Pineapple Express” because it brought warm subtropical moisture across the Pacific from near Hawaii, was melting lower parts of the huge snowpack built in California’s mountains.Yet another atmospheric river is already in the forecast for early next week. State climatologist Michael Anderson said a third appeared to be taking shape over the Pacific and possibly a fourth.California appeared to be “well on its way to a fourth year of drought” before the early winter series of storms, Anderson said Friday. “We’re in a very different condition now,” he added.The National Weather Service on Saturday forecasted an intensified bout of rain and snow Monday through Wednesday, with considerable flooding possible along the state's central coast, San Joaquin and Sacramento valleys and the southern Sierra Nevada foothills into midweek.Another round of heavy, wet snow is expected to hit the Sierras and areas of high elevation mid-week, the weather service said. Officials reported about 32 inches (81 centimeters) of snow had fallen by Saturday morning at the Mount Rose ski resort on the edge of Reno, Nevada.__Dazio reported from Los Angeles.",2023/03/13,,World

He also sat out March 7 with a non-COVID illness.Milwaukee won its last two without the team's leading scorer and rebounder and was 9-5 overall this season with him sidelined.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4832917,San Diego State beats Utah State for Mountain West title,"LAS VEGAS (AP) — San Diego State appeared to be in trouble Saturday, trailing by 11 points in the first half. Then, the Aztecs' defense took over.The Aztecs held Utah State without a field goal for nearly nine minutes, changing the tenor of the game as No. 20 San Diego State rallied to win 62-57 and capture the Mountain West Tournament championship.The Aztecs (27-6) claimed their Mountain West-record seventh tournament title, and second in three years. This also was their conference-record 15th appearance in the title game.San Diego State clinched the conference's bid to the NCAA Tournament, though it was never in doubt the Aztecs would be selected. What kind of seed San Diego State receives remains to be seen.“I think we're a four-seed, but we'll see what it is,” San Diego State coach Brian Dutcher said. “Our numbers are great. Our confidence is great.”Utah State (26-8) also figures to be headed to the tournament when the selections are announced Sunday.This was the fourth time in the last five years the teams have played each other in the Mountain West championship game. Utah State won the 2019 and 2020 title games, and San Diego State went home with the 2021 trophy. Boise State temporarily ended the monopoly last season by beating the Aztecs 53-52.“I think it’s more of a rivalry of respect rather than hatred or animosity,” Utah State guard Steven Ashworth said. “I think that’s what happens when you have the two best programs in the league going at it for over five years. We take pride in what we build as an Aggie culture. Obviously, they have a great culture and history here in the Mountain West.”Neither team shot well Saturday, with San Diego State making 33.3% of its shots compared to 37.1% for the Aggies. Utah State's points were a season low.“We were very fortunate to win today,"" Dutcher said. “I tell the guys at the start of the year that we’re one of the few teams when the shot won't go in, we can still find a way to win. We can hang in there and make enough plays to win the game.”Tournament MVP Matt Bradley scored 16 points for San Diego State and Jaedon LeDee had 13 points and 10 rebounds. Half of LeDee's rebounds came on the offensive end.“When he gets the ball, he's such a threat,” Bradley said. “He makes our team so much more dangerous.”For Utah State, Ashworth scored 13 points and Trevin Dorius 12.The Aggies were hot early, however, going on a 12-2 run in the first half to take a 26-15 lead with 6:57 left, but then went cold. They failed to make another field goal until 1:43 into the second half, but somehow didn't fall behind during that stretch.But the Aztecs got close, and eventually went back and forth with Utah State in the second half. San Diego State nearly put away the game by going up 53-46 with 3:03 left, but the Aggies got back to within three points with 48 seconds remaining and two points with 30.3 seconds to go.San Diego State closed out the game at the free throw line by making 9 of 10 free throws in the final 43 seconds.THE BIG PICTUREUtah State: The Aggies entered the game fourth nationally in 3-point percentage at 40.1, but struggled badly against San Diego State's long, athletic defense. Utah State made just 4 of 24 3-point attempts.San Diego State: The Aztecs come in waves. Nine players were in the game, and each was on the floor for at least 16 minutes and eight at least 19. All nine scored and collected rebounds.UP NEXTUtah State: The Aggies have a NET ranking of No. 18, so it would be quite a surprise if they aren't selected to the NCAA Tournament.San Diego State: A potential six seed could be coming San Diego State's way, but the Aztecs also might have worked their way into a No. 5.___AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/college-basketball and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/13,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4832922,Fernando Tatis Jr. gets 1st hits for Padres since 2021,"A hit is a hit, even if it's only spring training. For Fernando Tatis Jr., it's been a long time coming.The San Diego Padres superstar had been 0 for 16 this spring before hitting a smash shot off the glove of Chicago White Sox shortstop Erik Gonzalez for a single in the first inning Saturday at Peoria, Arizona. The hit came against former teammate Mike Clevinger. Tatis later added a two-run double.They were the first hits in 526 days for Tatis, who missed all of last season. He was on the cusp of returning from surgery on his left wrist when he was suspended for 80 games by major league baseball after testing positive for a performance-enhancing drug.“I remember how to hit,” Tatis told reporters. “It’s definitely clicking, feeling great.""Manager Bob Melvin said he was never worried about Tatis.“All he needed to do was get a good swing. It’s going to be off to the races,"" the manager said.Tatis isn't eligible to return to the active roster until April 20. When he comes back, he'll be in right field. The Padres signed shortstop Xander Bogaerts to a $280 million, 11-year contract in December.Until Saturday, Tatis' last hit was on Oct. 2, 2021, against the San Francisco Giants.After his suspension, Tatis had surgery on his troublesome left shoulder. When he returns to the active roster, he'll join fellow superstars Bogaerts, Manny Machado and Juan Soto in a potent lineup.CARROLL AGREESOutfielder Corbin Carroll and the Arizona Diamondbacks agreed to an eight-year deal with a club option for the 2031 season, the team announced. The contract is worth $111 million, according to a person familiar with the deal. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition on anonymity because the financial terms weren't announced. MLB.com first reported the deal.The 22-year-old Carroll is one of baseball’s top prospects and among the betting favorites — according to FanDuel Sportsbook — to win Rookie of the Year this season. Carroll was very good in a late-season cameo last season, batting .260 with four homers and 14 RBIs in 32 games.The Diamondbacks aren’t historically a big-spending team but were willing to pay to make Carroll a franchise cornerstone. The soft-spoken speedster is a Seattle native.He’s part of a young core of D-backs players, including outfielders Alek Thomas, Jake McCarthy, catcher Gabriel Moreno and pitchers Brandon Pfaadt, Drey Jameson and Tommy Henry. Arizona finished with a 74-88 record last season.WALKER HURTSt. Louis Cardinals rookie outfielder Jordan Walker, one of the sensations of spring training, left the game against the Houston Astros with a strained right shoulder suffered on a slide at second base in the first inning.But manager Oliver Marmol said he was not “overly concerned. Day to day.”Marmol said he hadn’t intended to play Walker on Sunday anyway and that Monday is a scheduled off day for the team. Walker will be re-evaluated Sunday but it seems he will be able to play later in the week.Before Sunday’s 3-2 loss to Houston, the 6-foot-6, 250-pound Walker led the Grapefruit League in hits (14), batting average (.438), slugging percentage, OPS, total bases and extra-base hits.“There was no reason for him to keep going and get it more fatigued,” said Marmol. “If it was up to him, he’d keep going but there was no reason to continue.”SONG SHUT DOWNThe Philadelphia Phillies are shutting down 25-year-old right-hander Noah Song for a few days because of back tightness. He had an MRI on Friday.“It’s just something that happens, I guess,” Song told reporters. “It kind of came on gradually, I guess, a couple days ago. It’s just something that they wanted to be very cautious of and aware of. We’re just going to monitor it as time goes on.”The Phillies selected song in the Rule 5 Draft and he must spend at least 90 days on the active roster to stay with the organization beyond this season. Song appears headed to the injured list because the Phillies said he won't be ready to pitch by opening day.Song had been a flight officer training on a U.S. Navy P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol and reconnaissance aircraft at Naval Air Station Jacksonville in northeast Florida before the Navy granted a transfer from active duty to reserves. That decision allowed him the chance to try and regain the skills that were impressive during his only pro season in 2019 when he made seven starts for Boston’s Class A Lowell affiliate, striking out 19 in 17 innings with a 1.06 ERA. With a fastball in the upper 90s mph, he went 11-1 with a 1.44 ERA and 161 strikeouts in 94 innings during his senior year at Navy.RUIZ DEALCatcher Keibert Ruiz agreed to an eight-year contract with the Washington Nationals, reportedly for $50 million. The contract begins this year and runs through the 2030 season, with club options for the 2031 and 2032 seasons.Ruiz was part of the trade deadline deal in 2021 that sent Scherzer and Trea Turner to the Dodgers. He is entering his fourth big league season.CHAPMAN PITCHESAroldis Chapman looked like his old self, even if it’s only halfway through spring training.The veteran reliever pitched one inning for the Kansas City Royals against the Milwaukee Brewers in Phoenix and struck out all three batters he faced on fastballs — minor leaguer Eric Brown Jr. (100 mph), Christian Yelich (101) and Mike Brosseau (102).Chapman, 34, had the worst season of his career last year with a 4.46 ERA in his final season with the New York Yankees, making most of his news off the field. He was sidelined late in the season with a leg infection caused by a tattoo, then when recovered, he failed to show up for a workout before the Yankees’ division series against Cleveland and was left off the roster.He went through the winter without a deal before finally signing for one year with Kansas City at $3.75 million. But before he could get to the mound, he injured himself in a fall in his home, cracking a tooth and splitting his lip.On Saturday, he looked none the worse for wear. He also has a history with Brosseau.Brosseau, then with Tampa Bay, homered off Chapman for the winning hit in the deciding game of the 2020 AL Division Series against the Yankees a month after Chapman buzzed him with a fastball, just missing Brosseau’s head. The Rays went on to reach the World Series.New Royals manager Matt Quatraro was the bench coach for the Rays back then.“That was an incredible outing,” Quatraro said of Saturday’s performance. “It was like 11 pitches. A great outing right there for sure.”___AP Sports Writer David Brandt and AP freelance writers Jack Thompson and Rick Hummel contributed to this report.___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/13,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4832923,Lightning captain Steven Stamkos injures left leg,"TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — Tampa Bay Lightning captain Steven Stamkos left in the first period Saturday night against the Chicago Blackhawks because of a left leg injury. Stamkos got tangled up with Chicago forward Joey Anderson in his own zone with less than three minutes remaining in the opening period. The two fell to the ice; Stamkos got up and skated off the ice holding his lower left leg and did not return. Coach Jon Cooper said after the Lightning’s 3-1 victory that he didn’t think the injury was serious. “I think he’s going to be OK,” Cooper said. “We just kept him out for precaution. We’ll check him out tomorrow, but we’re hopeful he will be OK.” The 33-year-old forward is second on the Lightning with 27 goals and third with 66 points. Stamkos, the No. 1 pick in the 2008 NHL draft, has played his entire NHL career with the Lightning. He’s the franchise’s all-time leader with 508 goals and 1,038 points. He reached the 1,000-point mark Dec. 1 and scored his 500th goal Jan. 18.___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/13,,World

California Baptist was the fourth seed.Daugherty was 8 of 13 from the floor and 10 of 13 at the line. Williamson added 13 points and 12 rebounds and Whitman 12 points and 11 rebounds. Daylani Ballena added 14 points and Megan Jensen 12.California Baptist's Chloe Webb scored 21 points and Sila Finau 15. Grace Schmidt added 10 points and Trinity San Antonio grabbed 11 rebounds. Four Lancers fouled out.Southern Utah led by 10 heading into the final quarter. The Lancers got within six after a 3-pointer by Dorcas Wu with 29.6 seconds remaining but didn't connect again as Ballena sank three free throws.After the teams combined for just 16 points in the second quarter which ended with the Thunderbirds ahead 31-23, they combined for 42 in the third. The Lancers missed their first 15 3-point attempts then made three in the third quarter, getting within six on Finau's four-point play with under four minutes left. But Whitman hit a 3-pointer to start a 10-6 quarter-ending run for a 53-43 lead.Southern Utah shot 49% and made 25 of 36 free throws to 13 of 20 for the Lancers, who shot 37% from the floor and put up 34 3-point attempts, making eight.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4832926,US government moves to stop potential banking crisis,"NEW YORK (AP) — The U.S. government took extraordinary steps Sunday to stop a potential banking crisis after the historic failure of Silicon Valley Bank, assuring all depositors at the failed institution that they could access all their money quickly, even as another major bank was shut down.The announcement came amid fears that the factors that caused the Santa Clara, California-based bank to fail could spread, and only hours before trading began in Asia. Regulators had worked all weekend to try to find a buyer for the bank, which was the second-largest bank failure in history. Those efforts appeared to have failed Sunday.In a sign of how fast the financial bleeding was occurring, regulators announced that New York-based Signature Bank had also failed and was being seized on Sunday. At more than $110 billion in assets, Signature Bank is the third-largest bank failure in U.S. history.In an effort to shore up confidence in the banking system, the Treasury Department, Federal Reserve and FDIC said Sunday that all Silicon Valley Bank clients would be protected and able to access their money. They also announced steps that are intended to protect the bank’s customers and prevent additional bank runs.“This step will ensure that the U.S. banking system continues to perform its vital roles of protecting deposits and providing access to credit to households and businesses in a manner that promotes strong and sustainable economic growth,” the agencies said in a joint statement.Under the plan, depositors at Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, including those whose holdings exceed the $250,000 insurance limit, will be able to access their money on Monday.In a separate move, the Federal Reserve late Sunday announced an expansive emergency lending program that’s intended to prevent a wave of bank runs that would threaten the stability of the banking system and the economy as a whole.Fed officials characterized the program as akin to what central banks have done for many decades: Lend freely to the banking system so that customers would be confident that they could access their accounts whenever needed.The lending facility will allow banks that need to raise cash to pay depositors to borrow that money from the Fed, rather than having to sell Treasuries and other securities to raise the money. Silicon Valley Bank had been forced to dump some of its Treasuries at at a loss to fund its customers’ withdrawals. Under the Fed’s new program, banks can post those securities as collateral and borrow from the emergency facility.The Treasury has set aside $25 billion to offset any losses incurred under the Fed’s emergency lending facility. Fed officials said, however, that they do not expect to have to use any of that money, given that the securities posted as collateral have a very low risk of default.Analysts said the Fed’s program should be enough to calm financial markets on Monday.“Monday will surely be a stressful day for many in the regional banking sector, but today’s action dramatically reduces the risk of further contagion,” economists at Jefferies, an investment bank, said in a research note.Though Sunday’s steps marked the most extensive government intervention in the banking system since the 2008 financial crisis, its actions are relatively limited compared with what was done 15 years ago. The two failed banks themselves have not been rescued, and taxpayer money has not been provided to the banks.President Joe Biden said Sunday evening as he boarded Air Force One back to Washington that he would speak about the bank situation on Monday. In a statement, Biden also said he was “firmly committed to holding those responsible for this mess fully accountable and to continuing our efforts to strengthen oversight and regulation of larger banks so that we are not in this position again.”Regulators had to rush to close Silicon Valley Bank, a financial institution with more than $200 billion in assets, on Friday when it experienced a traditional run on the bank where depositors rushed to withdraw their funds all at once. It is the second-largest bank failure in U.S. history, behind only the 2008 failure of Washington Mutual.Some prominent Silicon Valley executives feared that if Washington didn’t rescue the failed bank, customers would make runs on other financial institutions in the coming days. Stock prices plunged over the last few days at other banks that cater to technology companies, including First Republic Bank and PacWest Bank.Among the bank’s customers are a range of companies from California’s wine industry, where many wineries rely on Silicon Valley Bank for loans, and technology startups devoted to combating climate change. Sunrun, which sells and leases solar energy systems, had less than $80 million of cash deposits with Silicon Valley. Stitchfix, the popular clothing retail website, disclosed in a recent quarterly report that it had a credit line of up to $100 million with Silicon Valley Bank and other lenders.Tiffany Dufu, founder and CEO of The Cru, a New York-based career coaching platform and community for women, posted a video Sunday on LinkedIn from an airport bathroom, saying the bank crisis was testing her resiliency. Given that her money was tied up at Silicon Valley Bank, she had to pay her employees out of her personal bank account. With two teenagers to support who will be heading to college, she said she was relieved to hear that the government’s intent is to make depositors whole.“Small businesses and early-stage startups don’t have a lot of access to leverage in a situation like this, and we’re often in a very vulnerable position, particularly when we have to fight so hard to get the wires into your bank account to begin with, particularly for me, as a Black female founder,” Dufu told The Associated Press.Silicon Valley Bank began its slide into insolvency when its customers, largely technology companies that needed cash as they struggled to get financing, started withdrawing their deposits. The bank had to sell bonds at a loss to cover the withdrawals, leading to the largest failure of a U.S. financial institution since the height of the financial crisis.Yellen described rising interest rates, which have been increased by the Federal Reserve to combat inflation, as the core problem for Silicon Valley Bank. Many of its assets, such as bonds or mortgage-backed securities, lost market value as rates climbed.Sheila Bair, who was chairwoman of the FDIC chair during the 2008 financial crisis, recalled that with almost all the bank failures during that time, “we sold a failed bank to a healthy bank. And usually, the healthy acquirer would also cover the uninsured because they wanted the franchise value of those large depositors so optimally, that’s the best outcome.”But with Silicon Valley Bank, she told NBC’s “Meet the Press,” “this was a liquidity failure, it was a bank run, so they didn’t have time to prepare to market the bank. So they’re having to do that now, and playing catch-up.”___Rugaber and Megerian reported from Washington.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4832927,No. 6 Marquette routs Xavier 65-51 to win 1st Big East title,"NEW YORK (AP) — The final night of the Big East Tournament never sounded like this before.Tyler Kolek and No. 6 Marquette raced out to a hefty lead and didn't look back, beating No. 15 Xavier 65-51 on Saturday to win its first Big East championship after 18 seasons in the conference.As the clock wound down on an historic victory by a storied program that had been longing for an elusive title, chants of “We are, Mar-quette!” echoed through Madison Square Garden.“Marquette is a special place that has had a special basketball program for a long, long time,” coach Shaka Smart said as he accepted the trophy. “We're so proud to bring a championship back to Milwaukee.”Kolek had 20 points and eight rebounds as the top-seeded Golden Eagles (28-6) dominated a Big East final that brought a Midwestern flavor to Midtown Manhattan.The brash Big East player of the year, who vowed his team would prove doubters wrong before the season, shared hugs with his family and friends as confetti poured down on the Golden Eagles after the game.“All the moments they’ve been through with me have led up to this moment right here,” Kolek said. “To share that with my high school coach, my brother, my dad, my two best friends, it’s special. There is no better feeling.”Smart's surprising team will head into the NCAA Tournament with a nine-game winning streak. Marquette's first appearance in the Big East championship game resulted in one of its best performances of a scintillating season.Kolek's steal and layup made it 51-27 with 14:12 left. Less than a minute later, after two offensive rebounds by the Golden Eagles, David Joplin made a corner 3 to double up second-seeded Xavier (25-9).Joplin finished with 12 points. Kolek was selected the tournament's Most Outstanding Player.Adam Kunkel scored 12 points to lead the Musketeers, who had a five-game winning streak snapped. Leading scorer Souley Boum was held to one point on 0-for-9 shooting.“I thought tonight there are times when their effort level and their quickness, their togetherness, their communication, it was like there were six players on defense against us,” Xavier coach Sean Miller said. “We couldn’t get a good shot, and that is to their credit.”Smart described his team's defense as “violent.”""Coming up here to New York, we’ve really played for the most part very, very sticky, tough defense,"" Smart said. “We’re going to need that if we want to advance in the NCAA Tournament.”This was the first Big East title game since the conference dropped football in 2013 to not feature any of its longstanding Northeast members.Still, the Milwaukee school, which joined in 2005, and the Cincinnati school, which joined in 2013, filled The Garden for the first 1 vs. 2 seed Big East Tournament final in 19 years.It looked more like a 1-16 NCAA Tournament game for a while.Marquette jumped out to a 21-4 lead, and never relented.“It was huge,” Smart said. “And our guys played with real force to start the game.”During a particularly splendid 2 1/2 minutes, Stevie Mitchell swished a corner 3, Kolek came off a screen to make another 3, Kam Jones got free for a reverse layup after a nifty hesitation move on the baseline and Kolek converted a layup off a give-and-go with Oso Ighodaro.At that point, Marquette was up 33-10 with 7:02 left in the first half and the Golden Eagles had not yet committed a turnover.Marquette's only previous league tournament title was as a member of Conference USA in 1997.Twenty-six years later, the Golden Eagles were able to clear the bench in the final minute of the Big East championship and their fans were finally able to make The Garden feel like home.BIG PICTUREXavier: The Musketeers played what Miller called one of their best two-way games of the season in the semifinals Friday night against Creighton. Less than 24 hours later, they did almost nothing well. Xavier shot 34% from the field, forced only four turnovers and was held 12 points under its previous season low. The Musketeers fell to 0-2 in Big East championship games.Marquette: Smart, who took VCU to a Final Four but never could find that consistent winning formula at Texas, guided a team picked to finish ninth in the Big East in the preseason coaches' poll to maybe its best season since Dwyane Wade led Marquette to a Final Four in 2003. The Golden Eagles tied a school record for victories set in 1970-71.UP NEXTXavier: Miller will have the Musketeers back in the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2018.Marquette: The Golden Eagles will be making their second straight trip to the NCAA Tournament and figure to earn perhaps a No. 2 seed.___AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/college-basketball and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/13,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4832928,"Cale Makar scores in OT to lift Avalanche past Coyotes, 3-2","DENVER (AP) — Cale Makar scored at 1:38 of overtime, Nathan MacKinnon ran his franchise-record home goals streak to nine games and the Colorado Avalanche beat the Arizona Coyotes 3-2 on Saturday.MacKinnon also extended his home points streak to 16 games. Denis Malgin opened the scoring for Colorado in the first period, Alexandar Georgiev made 18 saves and Mikko Rantanen had two assists.“I felt like their guy was going for the change or the middle of the ice,” Makar said about the overtime goal, the defenseman’s 15th of the season. “I felt like I could get enough speed to go around the outside. It was kind of a good spot and a good pick by Mikko there. It worked out.”Jack McBain and Clayton Keller scored for Arizona in the first period, with Keller giving the Coyotes a 2-1 lead with his team-best 27th goal.Connor Ingram made 41 saves in his first game back in Denver since he stopped 49 shots last year while a member of the Nashville Predators in a 2-1 overtime loss in the first round of the playoffs.“I got out too far,” Ingram said of Makar’s winner. “I jumped out. I didn’t think he would shoot the puck. He cut to the middle, he lost it for a second, which made it even worse, and then it ends up in his hands. It’s a tough bounce.”Arizona was outshot 44-20 margin and didn’t record a shot on net in the third period and overtime.“It was just smart, hard-working hockey and playing to our identity,” Avalanche coach Jared Bednar said. “It looked like we got stronger as the game went on because we were doing things right. It’s an easier game. You’re playing with the puck the whole time and you’re trying to create scoring chances. There was good hunger there to win it in regulation. We had a bunch of really good chances and just couldn’t capitalize, so we stuck with it and got it done in overtime. To me, it’s strictly about the commitment and determination we play with.”The Avalanche entered the game in a rut, with a 1-3-1 record in March after going 7-1-2 in February and beginning to look the part of a team that could successfully defend its Stanley Cup title.“I think there’s no reason to doubt it,” MacKinnon said. “We’ve made the playoffs five, six years in a row. We’ve gotten better every season. Obviously, this hasn’t been our best season by any means, but I truly believe if we were healthy for the whole year, we’d be five, 10 points up in the west and looking at a different mentality right now. We have to keep that in mind.”NOTES: RW Christian Fischer left in the first period for Arizona after suffering a lower-body injury. … G Ivan Prosvetov was scratched for Arizona after appearing in net two nights earlier in a 4-1 win over Nashville.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4832929,"Four astronauts fly SpaceX back home, end 5-month mission","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — Four space station astronauts returned to Earth late Saturday after a quick SpaceX flight home.Their capsule splashed down in the Gulf of Mexico just off the Florida coast near Tampa.The U.S.-Russian-Japanese crew spent five months at the International Space Station, arriving last October. Besides dodging space junk, the astronauts had to deal with a pair of leaking Russian capsules docked to the orbiting outpost and the urgent delivery of a replacement craft for the station's other crew members.Led by NASA's Nicole Mann, the first Native American woman to fly in space, the astronauts checked out of the station early Saturday morning. Less than 19 hours later, their Dragon capsule was bobbing in the sea as they awaited pickup.Earlier in the week, high wind and waves in the splashdown zones kept them at the station a few extra days. Their replacements arrived more than a week ago.“That was one heck of a ride,” Mann radioed moments after splashdown. “We're happy to be home.”Mann, a member of Northern California's Wailacki of the Round Valley Indian Tribes, said she couldn’t wait to feel the wind on her face, smell fresh grass and enjoy some delicious Earth food.Japanese astronaut Koichi Wakata craved sushi, while Russian cosmonaut Anna Kikina yearned to drink hot tea ""from real cup, not from plastic bag.”NASA astronaut Josh Cassada's to-do list included getting a rescue dog for his family. “Please don't tell our two cats,” he joked before departing the space station.Remaining behind at the space station are three Americans, three Russians and one from the United Arab Emirates.Wakata, Japan's spaceflight champion, now has logged more than 500 days in space over five missions dating back to NASA's shuttle era.___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4832930,Shaq Thompson restructures contract to remain with Panthers,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — Linebacker Shaq Thompson is staying with the Carolina Panthers after agreeing to restructure his contract, the team announced Saturday night.Thompson had a salary cap figure of more than $24 million before agreeing to a new deal, which had left his future with the team in doubt. The Panthers did not disclose how much salary cap room the restructured contract will clear for the upcoming season.Thompson, Carolina's first-round draft pick in 2015, had a career-high 135 tackles last season. He became one of four players in Panthers history to record at least 100 tackles in four straight seasons.Ejiro Evero mentioned Thompson as one of the players he was eager to work with after being hired earlier this year as the team’s defensive coordinator.“Those are all questions that are above my pay grade, but if you talk about the player, that’s definitely a player I really admire, and I think he’s a heck of a player,” Evero said last month. “Definitely would love to coach him. (He fits) very well. He’s an inside backer, a three-down player. He’s a guy that can play the run game. He’s good in zone coverage, can see the quarterback, can match running backs; he fits just right.”Thompson is fourth on the team’s career tackles list, trailing only Luke Kuechly, Thomas Davis and Mike Minter.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/03/13,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4832931,"Panarin scores in OT, Rangers beat Sabres 2-1","BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) — Igor Shesterkin bailed out the New York Rangers by stopping 32 shots to force overtime, and Artemi Panarin scored a power-play goal 2:02 into the extra period for a 2-1 win over the Buffalo Sabres on Saturday night.Patrick Kane scored his second goal in four games since being acquired by the Rangers in a trade with Chicago, but much of the credit for New York's fourth win in six outings went to Shesterkin.“When he’s on his game, we’re a hard team to beat,” defenseman Adam Fox said. “You never want to force him to bail us out, but that’s just what he does.”Despite making a near costly miscue on a Sabres' goal waved off because the play was offside in the second period, Shesterkin stopped the final 21 shots he faced, including 14 in the third period. His best save came with 65 seconds remaining in regulation, getting across to foil Victor Olofsson, who was set up alone at the left post.Jeff Skinner scored and Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen stopped 24 shots for Buffalo, which continues slipping out of the Eastern Conference playoff race. In dropping to 1-5-1 in their past seven, the Sabres showed resolve in attempting to bounce back from a 10-4 drubbing to the Dallas Stars on Thursday.“I think we played less tight than we have the last few games. I don’t know if we got to fearless yet. I think there’s a whole other level for us,” Buffalo coach Don Granato said. “Without compromising defensively, I felt we still generated enough to win a hockey game.”The Rangers never led until the final score for a second straight outing, after rallying to beat Montreal 4-3 in a shootout on Thursday.Panarin’s goal came 50 seconds after Buffalo defenseman Rasmus Dahlin was penalized for hooking Mika Zibanejad.Adam Fox set up the play when he drove into the high slot before having his shot blocked by the stick of Buffalo’s Zemgus Girgensons. With Luukkonen leaning to his left, the puck rolled the other way and directly to Panarin, who snapped it into the open side.Rangers coach Gerard Gallant credited his team for playing better defensively after allowing 12 goals in its previous three outings, while expressing concern with the chances New York gave up in the final minutes of regulation.“Late in the period like that in a 1-1 hockey game to give those chances, it’s not acceptable for our group,” Gallant said. “A lot of guys in there should be thankful that Igor made those saves for them.”With the score tied at 1, the Sabres initially appeared to take the lead with 7:49 left in the second period on a strange turn of events, which led to the goal being waved off.Shesterkin played the puck in the circle to his right. Instead of passing it to his closest teammate, the goalie fire it up the ice. Buffalo’s Tyson Jost gloved the puck down just outside the Rangers blue line and fired it into the untended net, just before Shesterkin had time to scramble into position.The goal, however, was immediately disallowed because Olofsson was offside as he was a step from the Sabres bench door while making a line change before Jost crossed the blue line.ICE CHIPSNew York improved to 10-0-1 in the past 11 meetings against Buffalo. ...

(AP) — Talen Horton-Tucker scored a season-high 37 points and had 10 assists and eight rebounds as the Utah Jazz defeated the Charlotte Hornets 119-111 on Saturday night for their second straight win.Walker Kessler added 17 points and 16 rebounds and Kelly Olynyk had 17 points for the Jazz, who outrebounded the Hornets 60-43. Lauri Markkanen had 13 points and 13 rebounds.Kelly Oubre Jr. scored 24 points and Terry Rozier added 22 for the Hornets, who had their two-game win streak snapped.Utah coach Will Hardy called the 22-year-old Horton-Tucker an “old soul,” adding that he has taken to coaching since joining the Jazz this season and that he loves the Chicago native's determination.“He understands what is real and what is not,” Hardy said of Horton-Tucker, a second-round draft pick in 2019. “He understands that so far to date he hasn't really gotten what he's wanted in the NBA. He wants to play more. He wants to be in the rotation. He wants to be a key player.""If he keeps playing like this it will be hard to keep him out of the starting lineup.Horton-Tucker, who has been pressed into the primary ball-handling role of late because of injuries, dominated the game from the outset. Nearly everything was falling from floaters to mid-range jumpers to 3-pointers and he finished 14 of 24 from the field.His previous season high was 23 points. He had a career-high 40 last season against Golden State.Horton-Tucker said he wasn't surprised by his scoring outburst.“I'm not trying to be cocky, but I just felt like I could do it,” Horton-Tucker said. “It's not the only time.”The Jazz never trailed and took a 58-49 lead into halftime after getting 15 points from Horton-Tucker, including a spin move in the lane that resulted on a one-handed dunk prompting a brief celebration under the basket.Utah quickly stretched its lead to 20 in the third quarter behind Horton-Tucker, who had 12 points in the third quarter and 10 more in the fourth.The Hornets entered the fourth quarter down by 16, but closed within seven before Horton-Tucker drove the lane, did a Euro step and got a floater to fall over two defenders after the ball danced on the rim before falling through.Horton-Tucker added two free throws on Utah’s next possession to push the lead to 11 and the Hornets never mounted another serious threat.The Hornets had 14 blocks on the night, but coach Steve Clifford said the team's defensive communication was not good.“A lot of Horton-Tucker's stuff looks bad for the guy guarding the ball – but it's not his fault, the talk’s too late,” Clifford said. “I’m standing right there. Our communication wasn’t nearly what it has been. That’s what leads to it.

The Pacers played without Tyrese Haliburton, Bennedict Mathurin and Myles Turner, and will again when the teams play again on Monday.“Those three guys are banged up enough that I'm going to keep them out until at least the Milwaukee game,” Carlisle said. “I want to see our young guys validate this performance by going out and doing it again on Monday.”The game was tied at 90 going into the fourth quarter, and the Pacers hit eight of their first 11 shots in the period to take a 114-103 lead.Detroit had its top three post players — Jalen Duren, James Wiseman and Marvin Bagley III — but were taken apart inside in the first half. The Pacers had 11 offensive rebounds to Detroit's nine defensive rebounds, and finished with 38 points in the paint and 15 second-chance points.“They kicked our behind every which way on the glass,” Casey said. “I talked to our bigs and told them if we’re going to play two bigs, we have to dominate the boards or at least play with more effort.”Duren's 14 points and nine rebounds kept the Pistons within 69-57, but his teammates managed only eight rebounds in the half.“When we're playing two bigs, we can't get outrebounded,” Duren said. “We know we have to fight against the Pacers — they are fighting for a play-in spot.”Detroit, outscored Indiana 20-8 in the first four minutes of the second half to tie the game at 77. Hayes finished with nine assists and six points in the third.“The third quarter wasn't what we wanted, but that's part of the development of young players,” Carlisle said. “I'm proud of the way they finished the game.”TIPS INPacers: Smith had 11 points and four rebounds in the first five minutes of the fourth quarter before being replaced by Jackson.Pistons: Duren played 14:18 in the first half, but had four of Detroit's eight offensive rebounds and five of their nine defensive rebounds. ...

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4832940,College umpire suspended for game-ending called strikes,"NEW ORLEANS (AP) — A college baseball umpire was suspended indefinitely by the Southland Conference on Saturday in connection with a pair of late called strikes to end a game between Mississippi Valley State and New Orleans.The sequence of disputed calls began when home plate umpire Reggie Drummer called a second strike on a breaking ball that appeared to cross the plate below batter Devon Mims' knees — low enough that UNO catcher Jorge Tejeda caught it just above the dirt behind the plate.Mims hopped out of the batter's box in protest and was subsequently called out on strikes on the next pitch, which broke low and away, well off the plate.“Oh my gosh! Wow! He got rung up on ball two!,” UNO radio play-by-play announcer Emmanuel Pepis exclaimed during the broadcast. “That is horrific! ... Drummer just wanted to go home.”UNO won the game 7-3.The Southland Conference said in its statement — which didn't identify Drummer by name — that after a thorough review, “the home plate umpire's conduct and actions were deemed detrimental to the conference and in violation of Section 3 Character and Conduct of the CCA Mechanics Manual for Baseball.”Section 3 states, in part, that ""umpires are expected to exhibit and uphold the standards of integrity of the umpiring profession,"" and that “umpires shall bear a great responsibility for engendering public confidence in sports.”A replacement umpire was assigned Saturday to the weekend series' second game, which New Orleans won 35-3, surpassing the Privateers' previous record of 32 runs in a game against Northern Illinois in 1994.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4832941,Hischier leads Devils to 3-1 win over Canadiens,"MONTREAL (AP) — Nico Hischier had a goal and an assist, and the New Jersey Devils beat the Montreal Canadiens 3-1 Saturday night.Nathan Bastian and Tomas Tatar also scored to help the Devils get their sixth win in eight games (6-1-1) and move two points behind Carolina for first place in the Metropolitan Division. The Hurricanes lost 4-0 to Vegas. Akira Schmid had 23 saves.“You’ve got to be comfortable being uncomfortable,” Devils coach Lindy Ruff said. “When a game gets to 2-1, there’s some uncomfortable moments. The other team’s gonna have a push, they have some good players. (Jonathan Drouin) rang one off the post in the third.“You have to be able to win a game 2-1 sometimes and wait for your opportunities.”Denis Gurianov scored for Montreal, and Jake Allen finished with 34 saves. The Canadiens, who blocked 25 shots, have lost six straight (0-4-2).“I think we played a good game, we had a lot of turnovers in the first period and we needed to defend ourselves, but we did that well,” Canadiens coach Martin St. Louis said. “We didn’t give them much so I was happy about that.“We improved in the second period on that side, playing behind them a little more. This is a good team, credit to them. They are really fast, they don’t give a lot of space but I think we’ve managed that well.”Bastian picked up a loose puck behind the goal, came around the right side, turned and fired a shot past Allen for his sixth goal of the season to put the Devils up 1-0 at 8:24 of the first period.Hischier made it 2-0 with 1:01 left in the opening period as he redirected a pass in from from Damon Severson for his 28th.The Canadiens got on the scoreboard with 1:37 left in the second as Rem Pitlick stole the puck away from Devils defenseman Damon Severson behind the goal line and sent a pass in front for Gurianov, who quickly beat Schmid for his fourth.Tatar capped the scoring with an empty-netter with 90 seconds remaining in the third period. It was his 15th goal.“I think we’re doing a lot of good stuff right now,” Tatar said. “Obviously, in some games you get certain puck luck when we bring the points home, but I think overall we’re very happy with where the game is.”SETTING A RECORDWith a secondary assist on the Devils’ second goal of the night, forward Dawson Mercer extended his point streak to 12 games. At 21 years, 133 days old, Mercer broke the franchise record for longest point streak for a skater under the age of 22.“What I’m noticing from Dawson is he’s playing a great 200-foot game right now,” Tatar said of his teammate. “He’s very good in every zone on the ice and it’s fun to watch.”Brendan Shanahan held the previous mark as the Hockey Hall of Famer was 21 years and 65 days old when he set the franchise record between March 8-29, 1990. Only four Devils players have longer point streaks: Taylor Hall (19 in 2017-18), Brian Gionta (15 in 2005-06), Patrik Elias (15 in 1999-00 & 13 GP in 2000-01) and Petr Sykora (13 in 2000-01).UP NEXTDevils: Host Carolina on Sunday night in the opener of a three-game homestand.Canadiens: Host Colorado on Monday night to finish a four-game homestand.___AP NHL: https://www.apnews.com/hub/NHL and https://www.twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/13,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4832942,Lightning beat Blackhawks 3-1; Stamkos injures left leg,"TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — Brayden Point scored his second goal of the game with a minute left and the Tampa Bay Lightning beat the Chicago Blackhawks 3-1 on Saturday night after losing captain Steven Stamkos to a leg injury. Point broke a tie with a one-timer from between the circles that beat Petr Mrazek. He has a career-high 43 goals. “He’s been the straw that stirred the drink many nights,” coach Jon Cooper said about Point. “He and Kuch (Nikita Kucherov) have such chemistry and they’re a dynamic group together. Just look at the play they made at the end on the winning goal. You put Point in that spot and more often than not he’s going to finish.” Brandon Hagel, acquired from Chicago in a trade on March 18, 2022, hit the empty net with two seconds remaining.The Lightning lost Stamkos, their career leader in goals and points, late in the first period with a left leg injury after he got tangled up with Chicago forward Joey Anderson and both players fell to the ice. Stamkos skated off the ice, holding his leg, and did not return. “I think he’s going to be OK,” Cooper said. “We just kept him out for precaution. We’ll check him out tomorrow, but we’re hopeful he will be OK.” It was the second gut-wrenching loss in as many nights for the Blackhawks, who were beaten 4-3 in overtime by Florida on Friday night.“It’s heartbreaking because I really felt our guys put it all out there tonight,” Chicago coach Luke Richardson said. “I thought we controlled the pace of the game. I thought we had some really good chances in the third after we scored; we got some momentum there. But they’re a good team.”Point opened the scoring at 6:21 of the second period, picking up his own rebound and lifting it past Mrazek. “Guys give it to me in good spots, that’s definitely for sure,” Point said. “I’m trying to shoot and sometimes it’s a numbers game. The more you shoot, the better chance you have to score.” Taylor Raddysh, acquired by Chicago in the trade for Hagel, tied it at 5:23 of the third period. Cole Guttman chased down the rebound of Tyler Johnson’s shot behind the net and centered for Raddysh, who snapped a shot past Brian Elliott for his career-high 17th goal. All three players had connections to the Lightning. Raddysh and Johnson played for Tampa Bay; Guttman, a sixth-round pick in the 2017 draft by the Lightning, signed with Chicago last summer as a free agent. “The guys were pumped to play here tonight,” Richardson said. “I think they all played very well.” Elliott finished with 23 saves, helping the Lightning beat the Blackhawks for the eighth straight time. Mrazek made 34 saves for the Blackhawks, the NHL’s lowest-scoring team.“Overall, I thought our game was pretty good,” Johnson said. “I thought we had a lot of chances, and Mrazek was unbelievable and kept us in it.”Neither team generated much offense in the scoreless first period. The best chance came in the final minute, when Mrazek stopped Tampa Bay’s Alex Killorn on a 2-on-1 short-handed rush. “We got better as that game went on,” Cooper said. “We were pretty sleepy in the first period. Because of that we weren’t executing, but as the game went on we got better. The big boys came in, made some plays at the end and we pulled it out.” Victor Hedman, Tampa Bay’s top defenseman, returned after missing two games with an upper-body injury. DOMINATINGThe Lightning are 19-1-1 in their past 21 games against Chicago, and 14-1-0 in the last 15 regular-season games at Amalie Arena since the start of the 2009-10 season.

(AP) — Top-ranked Iga Swiatek routed Claire Liu in 65 minutes to win her opening match at the BNP Paribas Open on Saturday.Swiatek, the defending champion who took over the No. 1 ranking nearly a year ago, won 6-0, 6-1. She lost just seven points in the first set.“Tactically and tennis-wise, everything was on point,” she said. “I had so many matches that were going my way in last couple of weeks that I know what to do.”Carlos Alcaraz, the second-ranked men's player, defeated qualifier Thanasi Kokkinakis, 6-3, 6-3. Alcaraz reached the semifinals in the desert last year and could return to the No. 1 spot for the first time since January if he wins the title.Taylor Fritz, the defending men's champion, rallied past former NCAA singles champion Ben Shelton, 4-6, 6-4, 6-3.Shelton’s biggest serve reached 147 mph.“I expected him to come out serving bombs, playing well,” Fritz said. ""I was ready for it, I just had to regroup, just find a way and problem solve. He’s an incredible player and it was an extremely tough first match to come out and play, so I’m happy to get through it.”Andy Murray beat Radu Albot, 6-4, 6-3 in his first straight-set victory of the year to set up a third-round match with Jack Draper. Murray had just 18 unforced errors to 35 for Albot, and never faced a break point on his serve while firing six aces.“Hopefully I can keep pushing myself up the rankings, keep building that confidence, and maybe get a few more straightforward draws, as well,” Murray said.Jannik Sinner defeated Richard Gasquet, 6-3, 7-6 (2). The 21-year-old Sinner fired 20 forehand winners against the 36-year-old veteran.“Obviously it was a tough match today, especially in the beginning I was a little bit tight,” Sinner said on court.Another 21-year-old, Draper, beat No. 24 Dan Evans, 6-4, 6-2. Draper has lost just eight games through his first two matches of his Indian Wells debut.No. 10 Felix Auger-Aliassime reached the third round with a 7-6 (5), 6-4 win over Pedro Martinez.Emma Raducanu, the 2021 U.S. Open champion, beat No. 20 Magda Linette, 7-6 (3), 6-2. Linette, a semifinalist at the Australian Open, got an early service break, but Raducanu jumped on her serve and tied it, 5-all, before forcing the tiebreaker.“I was so pleased with the way I fought. Because Magda played at a really high level,” Raducanu said. “Like some things that were working in the past weren’t working today, and I adapted.”No. 5 Carolina Garcia outlasted Dalma Galfi, 6-1, 6-7 (4), 6-4. Eighth-seeded Daria Kasatkina beat Tatjana Maria, 6-2, 6-1.Karolina Muchova beat two-time Indian Wells champion Victoria Azarenka, 7-6 (1), 6-3 while attacking the net in swirling wind conditions.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4832951,"Carry scores 26, Kent State tops Toledo to win MAC tourney","CLEVELAND (AP) — The pain from last year's championship loss, and the unusual circumstances surrounding it, stuck with Kent State's players, gnawed at them.On Saturday night, they finally found relief.Sincere Carry scored 26 points, Malique Jacobs added 18 and Kent State won the Mid-American Conference championship, 93-78 over top-seeded Toledo, which had its winning streak stopped at 17 and will likely miss the NCAA Tournament for the 43rd straight year.The second-seeded Golden Flashes (28-6) won their first tourney title since 2017 along with the conference's automatic NCAA bid.“I want to make some noise,” said Carry, Kent State's smooth senior guard, who didn't miss a shot or free throw in the second half. “I'm not just going there to experience the moment. I'm trying to win.”With 28 wins and some near-miss losses at Houston and Gonzaga, the Golden Flashes will be a tough out for any team. They're balanced, tough and in Carry have a player capable of, well, carrying them.Jacobs added 13 rebounds and six assists while atoning for a mistake last year, when he was suspended for the first half of the title game along with three teammates after they posted a profane video on social media following the semifinals.Kent State lost in the final 75-55 to rival Akron, and that score was the security code on the team's locker room door all season.“We kept 75-55 in our head,” Carry said.“This was supposed to happen,” added Jacobs.For Toldeo, it didn't happen again.The top-seeded Rockets (27-7) now must hope the NCAA selection committee looks at their entire body of work. However, history won't be on their side as the MAC hasn't had two teams in the 68-team field since 1999, and it's more likely they're headed to the NIT.“I'd like to see our league office do more to get two teams in,” said coach Tod Kowalczyk. “The fact that Kent State and Toledo haven't been talked about. That's a MAC problem. This team won 17 straight games. How many teams in the country have won 17 straight games?”Toledo fell to 0-6 in MAC title games since last winning in 1980.RayJ Dennis, the conference player of the year, scored 25 for the Rockets. Setric Millner Jr. added 25 and 10 rebounds for Toledo, which reeled off 17 straight wins since losing to Kent State on Jan. 10.But with a chance to end one of the nation's longest NCAA droughts, the Rockets couldn't finish the job.Toledo was still within 71-67 when the Golden Flashes went on a 10-3 run capped by Carry's long 3-pointer as the 30-second shot expired.The Rockets couldn't catch up in the final minutes as Kent State put it away at the foul line in the final minute. Appropriately, Jacobs grabbed Toledo's last miss before celebrating with his teammates, making up for a moment they let escape in 2022.“Last year was a really tough evening for us,” said coach Rob Senderoff. “So really proud of them and happy for them. These are special moments. It's hard to get to the NCAA Tournament in this league.”Toledo came in averaging 85.8 points per game — second nationally to Gonzaga — and these high-powered Rockets had scored over 100 points six times this season. But the Golden Flashes held them to a season-low 63 on Jan. 19, and Kent State's defense was up to the task early.Getting defensive stops, the Golden Flashes reeled off 11 points in a row to take a 27-16 lead.With Dennis unable to get going on offense, Millner picked up the slack by scoring 11 straight points and Toledo went on an 18-6 run to briefly take the lead before Jacobs' lay-in at the horn gave Kent State a 35-34 halftime lead.Toledo's NCAA dry spell has weighed heavily on the program, to the point Kowalczyk, who has been at the school for 13 years, felt it had become an unfair talking point.“Everybody wants to make a big deal about 1980,"" he said following Friday's semifinals. “That’s not this team’s problem.”Unfortunately, it hasn't gone away.___AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/college-basketball and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/13,,World

A person with direct knowledge of the contract confirmed the financial terms. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the team did not disclose those details.The 22-year-old Carroll is one of baseball's top prospects and among the betting favorites — according to FanDuel Sportsbook — to win NL Rookie of the Year this season. Carroll was very good in a late-season cameo last season, batting .260 with four homers and 14 RBIs in 32 games.The Diamondbacks aren't historically a big-spending team but were willing to pay to make Carroll a franchise cornerstone. The soft-spoken speedster is a Seattle native.He's part of a young core of D-backs players, including outfielders Alek Thomas, Jake McCarthy, catcher Gabriel Moreno and pitchers Brandon Pfaadt, Drey Jameson and Tommy Henry. Arizona finished with a 74-88 record last season.___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/13,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4832955,Kyrou scores hat trick as Blues beat Blue Jackets 5-2,"COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Jordan Kyrou scored three goals, seldom-used goaltender Thomas Greiss stopped 38 shots and the St. Louis Blues cruised to a 5-2 win over the Columbus Blue Jackets on Saturday night.Sammy Blais had a goal and two assists, Brandon Saad had a goal and an assist, and Brayden Schenn and Robert Thomas each had two assists for the Blues, who won their second straight after losing eight of nine.“It feels great to string a couple of wins together,” Kyrou said. “I think we played a well-rounded game by everyone, and we want to keep doing that and build that foundation.”Greiss, a 37-year-old journeyman, played in just his fourth game since Jan. 26 as starter Jordan Binnington got a rest day on the front end of a back-to-back.“(Greiss) stood on his head there early in the third period,” Schenn said.Patrik Laine scored his team-high 21st goal, Boone Jenner also scored and Michael Hutchinson, in his first start with the Blue Jackets, had 19 saves for the NHL's worst team. Columbus has lost four straight.Saad poked the puck past Hutchinson's right leg in traffic to get the Blues on the board at 7:19 of the first period. Laine answered less than two minutes later with a one-timer off a perfect cross-ice pass from Johnny Gaudreau on a power play.Kyrou tapped in a pass from Robert Thomas on a rush with about 6 1/2 minutes left in the first, and Blais' tally put the Blues up 3-1 with 1:53 remaining in the period.“We had 11 missed shots in the first period and five were prime scoring (opportunities), and we don’t hit the net, we don’t make him make a save, we don’t create a rebound or nothing,” Blue Jackets coach Brad Larsen said. “So some missed opportunities there and just some blown coverage.”Kyrou's scored his second of the evening off a rebound with 7:45 left in the third period. Jenner got his 20th goal of the season for the Blue Jackets to make it a two-goal game with 4:05 left.Kyrou completed his second career hat trick with empty-net goal with 1:17 left in the game, his team-leading 29th goal of the season.BLAZING BLAISBlais has four goals in 14 games since being traded back to the Blues from the New York Rangers Feb. 9. He had zero goals in 40 games with the Rangers. His three points in the game tied a career high for seven-year veteran, who played for the Blues for four seasons in 2017-20.“Sammy had a great game. We got some bounces early,” Schenn said. “Sammy had a nice play to (assist) Saad early. Three points and a heck of showing and a good first period. Could have had more in the second.”ELVIS OUTHutchinson made his first start for the Blue Jackets since he was acquired from the Vegas Golden Knights in a trade shuffle March 2. Regular starter Elvis Merzlikins traveled to his native Latvia to be with his seriously ill grandmother. Merzlikins had split time this year with Joonas Korpisalo, the longtime Blue Jackets traded to Los Angeles before the deadline. Columbus recalled Daniil Tarasov on an emergency basis from Cleveland of the American Hockey League on Friday so Columbus could have another goalie on the bench.ON THE BRIGHT SIDEThe Blue Jackets pushed their power-play goal streak to five games. Laine has a four-game goal streak and five-game point streak.UP NEXTBlues: Host Vegas Golden Knights on Sunday night.Blue Jackets: At San Jose on Tuesday.___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/13,,World

I spent a year in a refugee camp. Somehow I ended up here on Hollywood's biggest stage,"" Quan said.As a boy, Quan starred in a 1984 ""Indiana Jones"" movie and ""The Goonies"" in 1985. The 51-year-old said he had quit acting for years because he saw little opportunity for Asian actors on the big screen.""They say stories like this only happen in the movies,"" he added. ""I cannot believe it's happening to me. This is the American dream.""Quan's co-star Jamie Lee Curtis, who built a career in horror films such as ""Halloween,"" won best supporting actress for playing a frumpy tax auditor named Deirdre Beaubeirdre.Curtis, 64, looked upward and addressed her late parents, Oscar nominees Tony Curtis and Janet Leigh. ""I just won an Oscar,"" she said through tears.Among the other early awards, Guillermo del Toro's ""Pinocchio"" was named best animated feature.A crisis response team was on hand in case of an unexpected twist. The group was formed after Will Smith smacked Chris Rock on stage last year, tarnishing the film industry's most prestigious ceremony.Host Jimmy Kimmel, who landed on the Oscars stage by parachute in a tribute to best picture nominee ""Top Gun: Maverick,"" joked in his opening monologue about the audience reaction to Smith's attack last year.""If anything unpredictable or violent happens at the ceremony, just do what you did last year - nothing,"" he told the crowd of A-list celebrities. ""Maybe give the assailant a hug.""The film ""Navalny"" about the poisoning that nearly killed Alexei Navalny, Russia's most prominent opposition leader, and his detention upon his 2021 return to Moscow, won the Oscar for best feature documentary.The 95th Academy Awards ceremony was broadcast live on Walt Disney Co's DIS.N ABC network. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences hoped to move past the slap and stage a glitzy show and boost sagging TV ratings.Ahead of the awards, nominees dressed in designer gowns and tuxedos touted their movies on a champagne carpet in place of the traditional red.Several of 2022's biggest hits at the multiplex were competing in the best picture race, from ""Top Gun: Maverick"" and ""Everything Everywhere"" to ""Elvis"" and ""Avatar: The Way of Water.""Last year, the television audience for the Academy Awards ranked as the second-lowest ever with 16.6 million viewers.The big films on Sunday's ballot, rather than some of the little-seen movies nominated in recent years, could help draw more viewers. The musical performances also may boost viewership.Lady Gaga emerged as a last-minute addition and was expected to sing her nominated ""Top Gun"" song ""Hold My Hand."" Oscars producers said last week that Gaga was unable to make it because she was in the middle of filming a sequel to the 2019 movie ""Joker.""Pop superstar Rihanna also will take the stage, performing ""Lift Me Up"" from ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.""Michelle Yeoh of ""Everything Everywhere"" faces off in the best actress category with Cate Blanchett, who played a devious orchestra conductor in ""Tar."" Best actor may be a toss-up between ""Elvis"" star Austin Butler and Brendan Fraser, who played a severely obese man in ""The Whale.""Winners are voted on by the roughly 10,000 actors, producers, directors and film craftspeople who make up the film academy.(Reporting by Lisa Richwine;Editing by Mary Milliken and Howard Goller)",2023/03/13,262,Sports & Entertainment

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4832966,Drua's dramatic upset gives Super Rugby a shot in the arm,"WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — Super Rugby sophomores the Fiji Drua beat six-time defending champions the Crusaders in a third round match Saturday and blew some excitement into a competition fast losing public interest.The last minute win in Lautoka added a note of uncertainty to a competition plagued by predictable results.The Crusaders showed contempt for the Drua by choosing the match to rest most of their All Blacks and took a second-string team to play in front of the most avid rugby fans in the tournament.It was a miscalculation of the public relations front and a costly one for their championship chances as they dropped points against a team most top sides would expect to beat and fell to eighth place on the table with a 1-2 record.The Hamilton-based Chiefs and ACT Brumbies now are the only unbeaten teams in the tournament. The Chiefs beat the Dunedin-based Highlanders 28-7 and the Brumbies beat the Queensland Reds 23-17.The Drua are fifth and share a 2-1 record with the Auckland-based Blues, the Wellington-based Hurricanes and the Western Force. The Blues beat the Hurricanes 25-19, bouncing back from a loss to the Brumbies, and the Force beat Moana Pasifika 21-18.While the Drua won the match against the Crusaders with a penalty after the fulltime siren, Moana Pasifika were on the losing end of the same scenario as Bryce Hegarty kicked the winning goal for the Force after the siren.The winning kick for the Drua was taken by Kemu Valetini, a replacement playing his first match in Super Rugby and the brother of Wallabies backrower Rob Valetini.For the first half the match in front of packed bleachers at Churchill Park went as expected. The Crusaders dominated through its forwards and scored two tries from lineout drives.But the Drua scored a try before halftime, shored up their scrum against a fading Crusaders pack and took control. They played at pace and stretched the Crusaders in energy-sapping conditions. With two tries they led 22-12 and the excitement of the crowd grew and fed the Drua’s performance.The Crusaders rallied in the last 10 minutes and with two tries from forward graft took the lead with a sideline conversion from Fergus Burke.The Drua knew they had one last chance, forced an error from the Crusaders and Valetini knocked over the winning goal from close range.“We know we can play 80 minutes,” Drua head coach Mick Byrne said. “Last week we talked about circumstances that cost us points. It wasn’t our fitness, it was just the belief in ourselves to play 80 minutes.“We’ve talked about it for a number of weeks now. We went out and showed ourselves that we can do it. This week we managed to keep 15 on the field and that’s what we can do.“It’ll just be a great encouragement for our program and what we’re doing, especially for our players.”Few other matches in the round matched the entertainment produced in Lautoka.The match between the Blues and Hurricanes looked the best contest on paper and ended with the Hurricanes six points down and on attack. But once again discipline was an issue for both sides, mistakes marred attacking moves and poor tactical decisions made the match scrappy and dull.The Brumbies and Chiefs both are worthy of their unbeaten records but are not due to meet until the 14th round of the tournament.___More AP rugby: https://apnews.com/hub/rugby and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/13,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4832967,"Magic beat Heat in OT, 126-114 despite 38 points by Butler","ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — Wendell Carter Jr. had 27 points and 11 rebounds and the Orlando Magic bounced back from a fourth-quarter collapse to beat the Miami Heat 126-114 in overtime Saturday night.Jimmy Butler scored 38 points for the Heat, including 15 in the final six minutes of the fourth quarter when Miami overcame a 15-point deficit. Butler's 3-pointer at the buzzer of regulation sent the game to overtime.But the Magic outscored Miami 18-6 in the extra session.“Being able to withstand their run and shake back, after what they did late in the fourth and the buzzer-beater after they got all the momentum, that’s big-time for us,” said Jalen Suggs, who had 16 points and four steals for Orlando.For Magic coach Jamahl Mosley, the win reminded him of the last Miami-Orlando meeting — a 107-103 Heat OT win on Feb. 11. Only this time, his young team found a way.“I’m more proud of the fact that we were in the exact same scenario the last time we played them and we didn’t fold,” Mosley said. “We gained and learned from the experience from last time, and that shows the growth of a young team.”The finish of the fourth quarter included a wild sequence during which Paolo Banchero’s foul on a 3-point attempt by Butler with 14.5 seconds left was overturned on replay. But Miami got the ball to Butler one last time, and he connected to tie the game.“We didn't deserve to win,"" Butler said.Banchero had 17 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists for the Magic. Franz Wagner had 17 points and eight rebounds before leaving with an ankle injury early in the fourth quarter.Heat guard Kyle Lowry played 36 minutes in his first game in more than a month, and did so without starting for the first time in more than a decade.Lowry, who had 12 points and four assists, had missed 15 games with soreness in his left knee and his return was as a backup to Gabe Vincent. It was Lowry’s first time playing as a reserve since Jan. 26, 2013. He had started in each of his last 771 games, including 94 in the playoffs.“It was great to be back with the guys,” Lowry said.TIP-INSHeat: Tyler Herro played 27 minutes, battling through food poisoning. ... Miami lost C Cody Zeller in the first half after he collided with Orlando’s Jalen Suggs. Zeller needed stitches to repair a cut near his right eye and later it was determined he also broke his nose. ... Zeller’s injury led to C Omer Yurtseven playing for the first time this season after missing much of the year with an ankle injury. ... G Duncan Robinson (health and safety protocols) missed the game, as did F Caleb Martin (left knee soreness).Magic: Carter returned after a three-game absence and was back in the starting lineup, leading Orlando to a 54-35 rebound advantage. ... Orlando plays the Heat only once more this season on April 9 in the regular-season finale for both clubs, at Miami.LATE TECHButler was called for a technical foul in the final seconds of overtime for leaving the floor early.“I'm not going to get a fine and, league, you're not even going to think about getting a fine,” Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said, pointing straight to a camera in the postgame interview room, as if to underscore his point.The Heat were upset with referee James Williams, especially after it seemed he ignored a request from Butler to talk about getting struck in the face.“He got the last laugh on that one, the official did,” Spoelstra said.UD’S FINALEIt was the 40th and, barring an unlikely playoff meeting, the final time Miami would visit Orlando with Udonis Haslem on the Heat roster. He’s retiring after the season.UP NEXTHeat: Host Utah on Monday.Magic: Visit San Antonio on Tuesday.___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/13,,World

(AP) — Daniss Jenkins scored 22 of his 27 points in the second half and Walter Clayton Jr. scored 17 points and Iona beat Marist 76-55 in the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference Tournament championship game on Saturday night and clinched an automatic bid into the NCAA Tournament.Patrick Gardner scored 23 points and reserve Kam Farris scored 12 for Marist.The Gaels never trailed.“Man, I wanna cry right now, you know,"" Jenkins said after the game. “We put in a lot of hard of hard work; a lot of dedication, baby, and a lot of determination, you know. I told my guys tonight, let's just go out and play with a lot of passion, a lot of confidence, baby. This is what we worked for; we earned it... so let's go out and take what's ours.""Iona led 35-26 at halftime before Marist outscored the Gaels 20-9 in the first nine-and-a-half minutes of the second half with half Marist's points coming from the foul line.Farris made a 3 to tie it at 46-all. Jenkins made a 3 with 9:27 left and Iona gradually distanced itself. An 11-0 run turned a 57-53 lead to a 15-point advantage and the Gaels cruised from there.Iona (27-7) entered as the conference's top seed while Marist (13-20) was the 11th and final seed. Iona entered with a 13-game winning streak where the average margin of victory was 16.3 points per contest.Iona was playing in its 20th MAAC championship game in the conference's 42-year history while Marist was playing in its first. The last time the Red Foxes reached a title game was in 1992 when Robert Morris beat them in the Northeast Conference final.Marist entered the tournament having lost five of its last seven before putting together a three-game win streak to reach the conference championship game.Marist had a season in which it had a pair of five-game losing streaks, a four-game losing streak and a three-game skid.___More AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/college-basketball and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/13,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4832969,"Tatum's 34 help Celtics hold off Hawks' comeback, 134-125","ATLANTA (AP) — When the Atlanta Hawks wouldn't give up their comeback bid late in the game, Boston coach Joe Mazzulla said his Celtics survived because they were able to “navigate the chaos.”It helped that the Celtics sank 20 3-pointers.Jayson Tatum led a balanced attack by scoring 11 of his 34 points in the fourth quarter, and the Celtics overcame Atlanta's fourth-quarter comeback bid, beating the Hawks 134-125 on Saturday night.“We are playing at the level we are supposed to be playing,” Tatum said. “We responded when we needed to.”The Celtics opened a six-game trip by having six players score in double figures. Jaylen Brown had 24 points. Tatum added 15 rebounds.“We were intentional about what we wanted to accomplish,” Mazzulla said after the Celtics strengthened their hold on the No. 2 spot in the Eastern Conference standings.Trae Young had 35 points and 13 assists for Atlanta, which could not maintain momentum following back-to-back wins at Washington. The Hawks remain eighth in the East.With 1:25 remaining and Boston leading 129-121, Young and Marcus Smart had to be separated after the two were entangled and fell to the court under the Celtics' basket. Smart was called for an initial foul before a lengthy review by the officials called both players for technical fouls and ejected Smart.“I just saw them both kind of go down, definitely chirping at each other going down,” Celtics center Al Horford said. “We were all in there trying to do damage control.”The officials' crew chief, Sean Wright, told a pool reporter Smart was ejected “for the grab and takedown of Trae Young.” Wright said Young drew the technical foul ""for getting up and pointing in Marcus Smart’s face.”Young said he had “nothing much to say” about the skirmish. He made two free throws to cut the deficit to six points.The Celtics, who had only nine turnovers with 35 assists, had an answer for every Hawks challenge. Boston made 20 of 42 3s while Atlanta made only 10 of 34.Boston led by 16 at 60-44, but the Hawks rallied in the final period. Clint Capela's tip-in cut Boston's lead to 108-103 with 8:06 remaining. Boston still led by only five points before Smart's 3-pointer stretched the advantage to 117-109.Young's 3-pointer again pulled Atlanta within 119-114 before Horford answered with a 3 for Boston and Tatum's layup extended the advantage to 10 points.“I feel like in the last couple of games we’ve been very conscious of taking advantage of our possessions,” Horford said. “We had some adversity there but as a group ... we have to keep moving and we did that.”LOOKING FOR DEFENSEQuin Snyder has stressed defense, including against 3-pointers, since he was named Atlanta’s coach on Feb. 26.“If a team is going to make 20 3s in a game, it is tough to beat them,” Snyder said. “... It is something we continue to talk about and continue to work on and it is the end result of not staying in front of the ball.”SELLOUTBoston was welcomed to Atlanta by a strong turnout of fans wearing green in the sellout crowd of 17,884.30-10 DOUBLE-DOUBLE (AGAIN)Young has 10 games this season with at least 30 points and 10 assists, the most by any player in the Eastern Conference.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4832971,"Maple Leafs score 4 in 2nd period, down McDavid’s Oilers 7-4","TORONTO (AP) — John Tavares scored two of the four goals in the second period as the Toronto Maple Leafs roared back to down the Edmonton Oilers 7-4 on Saturday night.Mitchell Marner had a goal and three assists for Toronto, while William Nylander and Auston Matthews each scored and had an assist. Tavares added an assist for a three-point night and Noel Acciari had the other two goals, including into the empty net, for the Leafs.Matt Murray made 22 savesConnor McDavid replied with his NHL-best 55th goal of the season and added two assists for Edmonton. Leon Draisaitl, Evander Kane and Mattias Ekholm also scored for the Oilers. Stuart Skinner stopped 31 shots. Evan Bouchard and Ryan Nugent-Hopkins chipped in with two assists each.Down 3-1 in the second, the Leafs kick-started their comeback when Marner intercepted a Ryan McLeod pass in front of Edmonton’s net before beating Skinner with his 24th goal of the campaign.Marner then stole another puck — this time off Nick Bjugstad — to feed Nylander for his 34th that tied the game 3-3.Tavares made it 4-3 to complete a three-goal outburst in exactly three minutes after he and Matthews forced another turnover out of Darnell Nurse.The Leafs went to the power play late in the period, and Tavares scored his second of the period and 30th overall for a 5-3 advantage through 40 minutes.A feisty night on the ice finally boiled over eight minutes into the third when Kane and Michael Bunting were involved in a prolonged wrestling match in Edmonton’s end.Toronto got a power play that saw Matthews score his 30th before Draisaitl replied with his 42nd on another man advantage. Acciari then iced it into the empty net late.HOME DEBUTSSaturday marked the first home game as members of the Leafs for forward Sam Lafferty and defensemen Jake McCabe and Erik Gustafsson after the trio was added ahead of the trade deadline.Luke Schenn, meanwhile, will have to wait a little longer for his first game back at Scotiabank Arena.The blue-liner, who played for Toronto from 2008 to 2012, is in Vancouver awaiting the birth of his third child.UP NEXTOilers: Host Ottawa on Tuesday night in the opener of a two-game homestand.Maple Leafs: Host Buffalo on Monday night in the second of a four-game homestand.___AP NHL: https://www.apnews.com/hub/NHL and https://www.twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/13,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4832974,High-schooler Sammy Smith wins Xfinity race at Phoenix,"AVONDALE, Ariz. (AP) — Sammy Smith won the Xfinity Series race at Phoenix Raceway on Saturday, the first victory for the 18-year-old high school student who is taking classes online so he can be a full-time driver.Making his 13th start in the last two years for Joe Gibbs Racing, Smith led the final 52 laps and held off Cup Series star Kyle Busch on two restarts to take the checkered flag for the first time in a NASCAR national series event.“It's amazing. It's a dream come true,” Smith said. “It's awesome.”Ryan Truex finished second, followed by Sheldon Creed, Riley Herbst and Chandler Smith. Busch was second following a final restart with 15 laps to go, but made contact with Chandler Smith on the final lap and ended up ninth.Sammy Smith put JGR in victory lane in Phoenix for the 16th time in the second-tier series and for the sixth consecutive year — with six different drivers. Christopher Bell (2018), Busch (2019), Brandon Jones (2020), Daniel Hemric (2021) and Ty Gibbs (2022) previously celebrated at the mile-long track in the desert.Smith also became the youngest Xfinity Series winner at Phoenix. He did so with seemingly relative ease, leading 92 of 200 laps in the United Rentals 200 and not facing any significant challenges down the stretch.Busch briefly passed him following a restart with 24 laps to go, but Smith went right back by for good.After driving nine races for Gibbs last year, Smith is now running a full slate for Gibbs. He had to give up his senior year of high school to make it happen.ALLGAIER DISAPPOINTEDJustin Allgaier failed to extend his streak of top-three finishes. The JR Motorsports driver crashed with 22 laps remaining when he made contact with Kaz Grala and slammed into the outside wall. He finished 36th in a 38-car field.It was a disappointing ending for Allgaier, who won the first two stages of the race. He also had finished third or better in four consecutive Xfinity Series races. He was third in the 2022 season finale at Phoenix, third in the 2023 opener at Daytona, third at Fontana and second last week at Vegas.UP NEXTThe series races next Saturday at Atlanta Motor Speedway.___AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/13,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4832975,"Bruins fastest ever to 50 wins, clinch playoff berth","BOSTON (AP) — The Boston Bruins' T-shirt factory is struggling to keep up with all the milestones the team is cruising past on its way to the Presidents' Trophy.“Fifty wins, it's amazing,” said forward A.J. Greer, who was wearing a shirt commemorating Patrice Bergeron's 1,000th NHL point while discussing Boston's 50th win of the season, a 3-2 victory over Detroit on Saturday.The Bruins became the first team to clinch a playoff berth this season, earning their spot when the Capitals beat the Islanders 5-1 on Saturday night. Boston's win also made it the fastest team to 50 wins in NHL history.“I love playing for this team,” Greer said after assisting on Garnet Hathaway's game-winner with six minutes left. “I love wearing the Bruins logo and especially with the results, it’s been an amazing journey so far. But we’re not really focused on anything right now besides playing the right way for 60 minutes every night.”Hathaway gathered in a rebound and poked it in to break a third-period tie as Boston rallied from a two-goal deficit to beat Detroit and improve to 50-9-5 on the season. The 50 wins in 64 games broke the record of 66 set by the 1995-96 Red Wings and matched by the 2018-19 Lightning.“Congrats to us then, I guess,” said goalie Linus Ullmark, who stopped 30 shots. “But we focus on the process, and our process is what’s important.”The Bruins were already the fastest NHL team ever to earn 100 points.“Fifty wins is great. And it’s kind of a testament to how hard this team has continued to work throughout the year,” Hathaway said before the team headed to Detroit for a rematch with the Red Wings on Sunday. “But I think guys want 51, you know? Guys are excited to play this team tomorrow already.”After blowing a two-goal lead and losing 3-2 to Edmonton on Thursday night, snapping a 10-game winning streak, the Bruins fell behind 2-0 on Saturday before the game was 5 minutes old. But Hampus Lindholm and Bergeron scored 88 seconds apart in the second period, when Boston had the first 12 shots on goal and an 18-2 edge in shots in all.Hathaway broke the tie in the third scored to avert what would have been the Bruins' first back-to-back losses at home this season.“We never want to lose two in a row. We showed that today,” Ullmark said. ""We came out a little slow. They came out hot as well. Give them credit, they really came here to play in that first period and we were just weren’t ready for it.“But we took a breather in between the first and second, and we told each other we've got to ramp it up a little bit. And then we absolutely dominated them in the second.”Magnus Hellberg made 35 saves for Detroit, which snapped a six-game losing streak by beating Chicago on Thursday. Andrew Copp scored a short-handed goal in the second minute of the first period, and Alex Chiasson also scored to give the Red Wings a 2-0 lead just 4:32 in.Lindholm scored with seven minutes gone in the second, and the Red Wings appeared to respond quickly. But Dylan Larkin's goal was taken off the board because he had smacked the stick out of David Krejci’s hands seconds earlier.Instead, Bergeron tied it on the power play, deflecting a pass from Jake DeBrusk through Hellberg's legs. It stayed that way until Hathaway tallied his 10th of the season and his first since arriving in Boston before the trade deadline from the Washington Capitals.UP NEXTThe teams play again in Detroit on Sunday.___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/13,,World

His efforts were enough to earn him the honor of being declared the MVP of Pool A on Sunday evening (March 12).A two-run home run in the sixth inning helped lead his team past Italy 11-7 on Friday (March 10). The Amis Tribe member smashed a 125-meter grand slam in the second inning in his team's matchup against the Netherlands, contributing immensely to the 9-5 win.Chang had the distinction of being the only Taiwan player to score a run against Cuba. However, Chang's heroics were not enough to overcome the deficit, and Taiwan fell to Cuba with a score of 7-1.Although Taiwan tied with the four other teams in the pool with a record of 2-2, it was eliminated from further competition due to the tiebreaker derived from Taiwan's less favorable number of runs allowed. As for Chang, the Red Sox have decided to bring him back to their team after Trevor Story and Adalberto Mondesi were sidelined with injuries, reported Yard Barker.(CNA photo)(CNA photo)(CNA photo)(CNA photo)(CNA photo)Chang poses with MVP award.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4832981,Baseball cheerleaders chant 'Team Taiwan' instead of 'Chinese Taipei',"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — During the Taiwan national baseball team's run in the World Baseball Classic (WBC), its cheerleaders captured the attention of many international viewers and could frequently be seen leading fans in chants of ""Team Taiwan.""Baseball aficionados have become fascinated by the Taiwanese baseball team's cheerleaders as cheerleading squads are not traditionally featured at games in the U.S. The name of Taiwan's team has also led to much confusion because, like most international competitions, the national team must use the name ""Chinese Taipei"" when taking part in baseball tournaments, but the cheerleaders have helped make the team's true identity clear.(CNA photo)Prior to the WBC, Baseball America ranked Taiwan 14th out of the 20 teams competing, with China ranked last. However, it indicated that in addition to its roster of former major league players and top CPBL players, the home crowd could also be an x-factor.Indeed, the cheer squad made the home crowd at Taichung Intercontinental Stadium a force to be contended with, especially in the wins over Italy and the Netherlands, according to CNA. Matt Monagan wrote for MLB.com that the cheerleaders constantly keep the crowd charged as they ""sing songs, they stomp on the dugout, they are the source of all the energy in the ballpark for sometimes four hours at a time.""(CNA photo)In February, Jomboy Media posted footage of a promotional event featuring the cheer squad and wrote ""If you're not already pumped up for the World Baseball Classic, the cheerleaders for Team Taiwan will have you ready to run through a brick wall."" When uploading footage of the cheerleaders and mascot flailing their arms to energize the crowd on Thursday (March 9), Twitter user Kevin Terrell wrote, ""I think the cheerleaders and fans get more exercise than the players.'Footage of the squad and mascot frenetically dancing during Taiwan's game with Italy on Friday (March 10) went viral on Twitter. The caption of the video posted by Fox Sports describes the scene at Taichung Intercontinental Baseball Stadium as a ""PARTY,"" and an announcer can be heard marveling ""The cardio of these fans!""(CNA photo)On Sunday (March 12), political scientist Wen-Ti Sung posted video on Twitter showing fans repeatedly shouting in unison ""Team Taiwan!"" Describing the behavior as ""Taiwan's sports nationalism,"" Sung said the chants break out whenever announcers and cheerleaders asked ""Who are we?""(CNA photo)(CNA photo)(CNA photo)(CNA photo)If you’re not already pumped for the World Baseball Classic, the cheerleaders for Team Taiwan will have you ready to run through a brick wall pic.twitter.com/R7C61NVkPQIt’s like this for every at bat for every #Taiwan player, the entire game.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4832982,Bittersweet ending for Taiwan’s WBC hopes,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwan’s best opportunity to advance out of Pool A was dashed when the team succumbed in a lopsided loss to Cuba 7-1 late Sunday afternoon (March 13).The only hope was predicated on Italy defeating the Netherlands, and a favorable outcome in tie-breaking scenarios. Each team in Pool A finished with an identical 2-2 record, but the tie-breaker (runs allowed divided by the number of defensive outs) was where Taiwan faltered.Taiwan ranked last in Pool A as a result of surrendering 31 runs over 4 games, according to CBS Sports. Poor pitching, porous defense, and too many unforced errors cost the team relegation from the next WBC tournament, meaning Taiwan will have to win their way back into WBC play through participation in a qualifying tournament.If there were any bright spots for the Taiwan team, strong performances by Yu Chang (張育成) and Li Lin (林立) powered an improbable comeback victory against Italy and helped defeat a strong Dutch squad. Also, strong audience participation and the popularity of cheerleaders bode well for the upcoming CPBL season.At the conclusion of group play, Yu Chang was selected as the MVP of Pool A with 2 home runs and an outstanding 7-for-16 at the plate for a batting average of .438. He also had the distinction of scoring the lone run or the only RBI in what would have been a shutout loss to Cuba.It’s worth noting that Taiwan has been in this situation before. The previous WBC tournament in 2017 also saw Taiwan finish last in group play. According to regulations, Taiwan would have to earn a spot in the tournament through participation in qualifying play.However, because the number of teams in the tournament expanded from the original 16 to 20, Taiwan was able to directly qualify for the 2023 WBC competition, per CNA. This loophole is not expected to exist for the next tournament though, at the moment, qualifying competition for the next WBC tournament has yet to be finalized.",2023/03/13,1478,Sports & Entertainment

Edi Kasdiwan of the Indonesian Seafarers Gathering Forum (FOSPI) said that having Wi-Fi on the boats will mean fishers can communicate with both labor organizations and their families.“This is how we will protect our rights and our mental health and ensure we are getting fair pay and treatment,” Kasdiwan said. “We are asking seafood companies, governments, and vessel owners to ensure we have rights on the job and a way to talk to the outside world when we’re at sea.”Research was conducted on 15 Taiwanese migrant-staffed fishing vessels in 2022 that showed only 11 had Wi-Fi access, though at best, the crew only had access for three hours each day. Following that, other ships only provided access on some days for a limited time, as short as 15 minutes.Migrant fishers' most recent protest in Taiwan was in late February when fishers and rights groups gathered at the Taipei Fish Market to call on the government to ensure there is encrypted Wi-Fi on every Taiwanese boat. In a statement released in November, the Fisheries Agency of the Department of Agriculture said that it would provide subsidies of NT$3 million (US$99,000) for the purchase of equipment and monthly payments of NT$8000 for subscription fees, per ship.A representative from the Stella Maris Seafarers Center, a Jesuit group advocating for migrant laborers based in Kaohsiung, told Taiwan News on Monday (March 13) that they have received no further updates from the Taiwan government since the November announcement.",2023/03/13,793,Society

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833016,Pence says Trump 'endangered my family' on Jan. 6,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Former Vice President Mike Pence on Saturday harshly criticized former President Donald Trump for his role in the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol, widening the rift between the two men as they prepare to battle over the Republican nomination in next year's election.“President Trump was wrong,"" Pence said during remarks at the annual white-tie Gridiron Dinner attended by politicians and journalists. ""I had no right to overturn the election. And his reckless words endangered my family and everyone at the Capitol that day, and I know history will hold Donald Trump accountable.”Pence's remarks were the sharpest condemnation yet from the once-loyal lieutenant who has often shied away from confronting his former boss. Trump has already declared his candidacy. Pence has not, but he's been laying the groundwork to run.In the days leading up to Jan. 6, 2021, Trump pressured Pence to overturn President Joe Biden's election victory as he presided over the ceremonial certification of the results. Pence refused, and when rioters stormed the Capitol, some chanted that they wanted to “hang Mike Pence.”The House committee that investigated the attack said in its final report that “the President of the United States had riled up a mob that hunted his own Vice President.""With his remarks, Pence solidified his place in a broader debate within the Republican Party over how to view the attack. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, for example, recently provided Tucker Carlson with an archive of security camera footage from Jan. 6, which the Fox News host has used to downplay the day's events and promote conspiracy theories.“Make no mistake about it, what happened that day was a disgrace,"" Pence said in his Gridiron Dinner remarks. ""And it mocks decency to portray it any other way.”Trump, meanwhile, has continued to spread lies about his election loss. He's even spoken in support of the rioters and said he would consider pardoning them if he was reelected.Speeches at the Gridiron Dinner are usually humorous affairs, where politicians poke fun at each other, and Pence did plenty of that as well.He joked that Trump's ego was so fragile, he wanted his vice president to sing “Wind Beneath My Wings” — one of the lines is “did you ever know that you’re my hero?” — during their weekly lunches.He took another shot at Trump over classified documents.“I read that some of those classified documents they found at Mar-a-Lago were actually stuck in the president's Bible,"" Pence said. “Which proves he had absolutely no idea they were there.”Even before the dinner was over, Pence was facing criticism for his jokes about Transportation Secretary Buttigieg, the first openly gay Cabinet member in U.S. history.Pence mentioned that, despite travel problems that were plaguing Americans, Buttigieg took ""maternity leave” after he and his husband adopted newborn twins.“Pete is the only person in human history to have a child and everyone else gets post-partum depression,” Pence said. ___Megerian reported from Wilmington, Delaware.",2023/03/13,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833017,"No. 1 Houston in AAC tourney final again, but Sasser's hurt","FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) — When Marcus Sasser crumbled awkwardly to the court after his feet slipped from under him while dribbling past midcourt, Houston coach Kelvin Sampson knew something was wrong even without really seeing what had happened.“Marcus goes down, it means he’s hurt,” Sampson said. ""We always say pain is an opinion. Some kids have a high opinion. Some kids have a low opinion. But Marcus doesn’t go down. He never misses practice, never misses a rep. He’s always there.”Sasser, the American Athletic Conference player of the year, suffered an apparent groin injury with about 6 1/2 minutes left in the first half of the top-ranked Cougars’ 69-48 win over Cincinnati in their AAC tournament semifinal game Saturday.Houston (31-2), which led throughout, was up by eight when Sasser got hurt and expanded that to 15 by halftime.Sampson said Sasser would be re-evaluated, but indicated that the senior guard might not play when the two-time reigning regular-season champion Cougars try to win their third consecutive AAC tournament title against Memphis on Sunday.“I would probably err on the side of holding him out because of how important next week is,” Sampson said. “But the most important thing is Marcus ... his healthy going forward is the most important thing here.”Jamal Shead had 16 points and nine assists for the Cougars in the AAC semifinal, which matched two teams that are moving to the Big 12 next season. J’Wan Roberts had two second-chance layups in the game's first minute to put Houston ahead to stay. He finished with 16 points and eight rebounds, while Jarace Walker had 13 points.“Just knowing that Marcus came out of the game and we still have teammates that we know that come off the bench and come with that same energy, it just shows a lot about our team,"" Roberts said. ""It just shows everybody has each other's back and we never get away from what we’re doing, just staying together.”Houston is a sure bet to be a No. 1 seed when the NCAA Tournament bracket comes out Sunday, no matter what happens in its fifth straight AAC Tournament championship game.Landers Nolley II had 14 points for Cincinnati (21-12), which shot a season-worst 25.5% (13 of 51) from the field.After 30 points for the Cougars on Friday, Sasser had four points in nine minutes against Cincinnati before the non-contact injury. He was dribbling between the conference logo and the 3-point line when his right foot appeared to slip, throwing him off-balance before his left foot slipped as well, sending him into an awkward split.Sasser was a starter on the Cougars’ 2021 Final Four team but missed their run to the NCAA Elite Eight last year because of a broken bone in his left foot before Christmas. He didn’t talk to the media after the game.Cincinnati was within 44-35 on a 3-point by Nolley with about 15 minutes left — the only time after halftime the Bearcats were within single digits. Shead then started a 17-3 run with a jumper, and had seven points in the spurt that pushed Houston's lead to 61-38.“Obviously, they’re the No. 1-ranked team in the country for a reason, and they’re a difficult team to score on,” Bearcats coach Wes Miller said. “It was a tough night for us, because we didn’t score and we didn’t defend well. So that’s how you get that kind of a lopsided margin.”BIG PICTURECincinnati: The Bearcats will miss the NCAA Tournament again, their last appearance being 2019, which was their ninth in a row. ... For the second straight day, Cincinnati was down 10 points less than seven minutes into the game. But there would be no comeback like Friday’s 84-54 victory over Temple for the Bearcats' largest-ever winning margin in a conference tournament game. Instead, they lost by more than 20 points for only the second time this season.Houston: The Cougars bounced back from Friday’s season-worst shooting game (28.1% overall, 16 of 57). They nearly doubled that in the semifinal game, shooting 50.9% (29 of 57). ... Houston is 11-0 in Dickies Arena, and still hasn’t lost away from home this season.UP NEXTHouston plays Memphis (25-8) in the tournament championship game Sunday. The winner gets the league's automatic NCAA Tournament berth, but both will be make the 68-team NCAA field — like last year, when the Cougars beat the Tigers 71-53 for the AAC tournament title.___ AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/college-basketball and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/13,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833021,"Favoring continuity, China reappoints central bank governor","BEIJING (AP) — China on Sunday reappointed Yi Gang as head of the central bank in an effort to reassure entrepreneurs and financial markets by showing continuity at the top while other economic officials change during a period of uncertainty in the world's second-largest economy.Yi, whose official title is governor of the People’s Bank of China, plays no role in making monetary policy, unlike his counterparts in other major economies. His official duties lie in “implementing monetary policy,” or carrying out decisions made by a policymaking body whose membership is a secret.But the central bank governor acts as spokesperson for monetary policy, is the most prominent Chinese figure in global finance and is in charge of reassuring bankers and investors at a time when China’s economy is emerging from drastically slower growth.At the March 5 opening of the annual session of China’s rubber-stamp parliament, the National People’s Congress, China announced plans for a consumer-led revival of the struggling economy, setting this year’s growth target at “around 5%.”Last year’s growth fell to 3%, the second-weakest level since at least the 1970s, putting president and head of the ruling Communist Party Xi Jinping under exceptional pressure to revitalize the economy.A longtime veteran of monetary policy departments, Yi was first appointed governor of the People’s Bank of China in March 2018, taking over from the highly regarded Zhou Xiaochuan.Before becoming governor, Yi spent 20 years at the central bank after getting his Ph.D. from the University of Illinois and working as a professor of economics at Indiana University from 1986 to 1994.He is also a co-founder and professor at Peking University's China Center for Economic Research.The party made a similar decision to opt for continuity in 2013, when then-PBOC governor Zhou, who already had been in the job for a decade, stayed on as governor while all other economic regulators changed.Yi's reappointment came on the congress's penultimate day, which also saw Xi loyalists appointed as finance minister and head of the Cabinet planning agency to carry out a program to tighten control over entrepreneurs, reduce debt risks and promote state-led technology development. Incumbent Wang Wentao was reappointed minister of commerce.The congress also named four vice premiers, individuals who may be in line for higher office. They include sixth-ranking member of the party's all-powerful Politburo Standing Committee, Ding Xuexiang, as vice premier overseeing administrative matters. Veteran bureaucrats He Lifeng, Zhang Guoqing and Liu Guozhong were also named to the post. Liu and Zhang were incumbents.Foreign Minister Qin Gang was also appointed to the position of state councilor, a position also held by Wang Yi, his predecessor and current superior as director of the party's Office of the Central Foreign Affairs Commission.Defense Minister Li Shangfu, an aerospace engineer by training, was also named one of the five state councilors, along with Minister of Public Security Wang Xiaohong and Secretary General of China's Cabinet, known as the State Council, Wu Zhenglong. Shen Yiqin was the only woman named to the position and is China's highest-ranking female politician.No women sit on the 24-member Politburo or its standing Committee, and the party's more-than-200-member Central Committee is 95% male.A priority for finance officials will be to manage corporate and household debt that Beijing worries has risen to dangerous levels. Tighter debt controls triggered a slump in China’s vast real estate industry in 2021, adding to the COVID-19 pandemic’s downward pressure on the economy.At the same time, the ruling party is trying to shift money into technology development and other strategic plans. That has prompted warnings too much political control over emerging industries could waste money and hamper growth.Xi has favored promoting officials who sometimes lack the experience of their predecessors and exposure to global industry and finance markets. That reflects Xi’s effort to purge the Chinese system of Western influence and promote homegrown strategies.___Associated Press writer Joe McDonald contributed to this report.",2023/03/13,,World

Andre Drummond scored the first six points in that stretch and DeRozan capped it with a three-point play.The Rockets got their first points in almost three minutes on a basket by Jalen Green after that. He was fouled on the play and missed the free throw, but Smith grabbed the rebound and finished with a dunk to make it 102-98.The Rockets led by a point at halftime and the teams stayed close through most of the third quarter. A 3-pointer by Vucevic got Chicago within one with about three minutes left in the quarter, but Houston scored the next six points to make it 87-80 a minute later.LaVine made two free throws after that before the Rockets used an 8-2 run, with 3s from Tari Eason and Kevin Porter Jr., to extend the lead to 95-84.LaVine had a three-point play near the end of the third to get the Bulls within 95-87 entering the fourth.Houston led by as many as 13 points early, but the Bulls cut the lead to 55-54 by halftime.TIP-INSBulls: Drummond had 11 points and five rebounds. ...

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833027,Roddy leads fourth-quarter rally as Grizzlies beat Mavericks,"MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) — Rookie David Roddy scored a career-high 24 points, including 17 points in the fourth quarter, as the Memphis Grizzlies rallied for a 112-108 victory over the short-handed Dallas Mavericks on Saturday night.Roddy connected on 7 of 8 shots in the fourth, including 3 of 4 from outside the arc. Desmond Bane led the Grizzlies with 25 points, while Jaren Jackson Jr. finished with 14 points.Tim Hardaway Jr. lead the Mavericks with 23 points, while Jaden Hardy finished with 22. Josh Green added 21 points for Dallas.Two of the NBA's biggest stars — the Mavericks' Luka Doncic and Memphis' Ja Morant — were absent from the game. Doncic has a left thigh strain, while Morant is away from the team after posting a video last weekend in which he appeared to be displaying a gun at a Denver-area strip club.That eliminated the top scorers from the two Western Conference teams. Then Dallas' Kyrie Irving was a late scratch with right foot soreness.But Dallas stayed close in the first half, despite Memphis shooting 55%. And the Mavericks would overtake Memphis in the third. Hardaway had 13 points in the period as Dallas outscored the Grizzlies 33-21.And the Mavericks continued to extend the lead to open the fourth.TIP-INSMavericks: Rookie Jaden Hardy started his first NBA game at G. ... Defeated the Grizzlies 137-96 in Dallas' home opener this season. ... Are 12-21 on the road.Grizzlies: Jones recorded his 2,000th career assist in the second quarter. ... Snapped a four-game losing streak to Dallas.MORE ADVICE FOR MORANTThe troubles with Morant continue to be the talk of the league, whether its questions from the media or responses from coaches. The Grizzlies guard is expected to be away from the team at least two more games.Prompted by a question, Mavericks coach Jason Kidd said sometimes young players are given high status too early. He said it is important for Morant to have someone to talk to without any negativity and provide the right advice. “Hopefully, with the time away from the team, he will become stronger on and off the floor, and he will be able to share his story to become a leader and a mentor.”UP NEXTThe two teams play each other in Dallas on Monday.___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/13,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833029,"Filipowski, No. 21 Duke beat No. 13 Virginia for ACC title","GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) — Jon Scheyer stood on the stage, wiping his brow as he scanned the bubbly crowd while his Duke players danced around the Atlantic Coast Conference Tournament championship trophy.That's when Kyle Filipowski walked up behind his coach and wrapped an arm around him.The youthful Blue Devils — from their freshmen to their 35-year-old rookie head coach — could savor a moment that felt oh-so-familiar for the blueblood program.Filipowski had 20 points and 10 rebounds as the tournament's most valuable player and No. 21 Duke locked down defensively to beat No. 13 Virginia 59-49 in Saturday night's ACC tournament championship, securing a title in Scheyer's debut season as the successor to Hall of Fame coach Mike Krzyzewski.“Coming in, everyone was talking about, ‘We’re too young, Scheyer’s first year,’” freshman guard Tyrese Proctor said while standing amid confetti strewn about the court. “We just stuck together all year and just didn’t give up.”Jeremy Roach scored 19 of his career-high 23 points after halftime for the fourth-seeded Blue Devils (26-8), who completed a final-month surge to the top of the ACC to claim a league-record 22nd championship.Only now, it's with the former Blue Devils player and assistant coach in charge.Scheyer spent last year as the coach-in-waiting for Krzyzewski's last Final Four run, assembled the nation's top-ranked recruiting class, then masterfully led that group through youthful ups and downs to enter the NCAA Tournament on a nine-game winning streak.Yes, he said, the new players that arrived this year or returned from last year wanted to be part of Duke's tradition. But it was also a leap of faith at a pivotal moment of change for the program, too.“They believed in us and in me,” Scheyer said, “and obviously I felt that way about each of them.”And it all had Scheyer soaking up the scene of celebrating fans from his midcourt-stage perch and basking in ""a surreal feeling.” That includes becoming the first to win an ACC Tournament title as both a player and a coach in league history, and only the third first-year coach ever to claim the title.Duke's winning streak began after an overtime loss at Virginia in which a league-acknowledged officiating error cost the Blue Devils a chance to win in regulation. This time, Duke grinded its way through to the horn by leaning on a defense-first approach that Scheyer has pushed all season.The Blue Devils held the second-seeded Cavaliers (25-7) to 33% shooting, with Virginia missing both contested and clean looks while committing nearly as many turnovers (12) as made shots (16).“Their length and athleticism was real, and I think at times it sped us up,” Virginia coach Tony Bennett said. “And we were at times a little bit uncharacteristic or a bit rushed. I think they sat down and guarded. We sat down and tried to guard hard, and there just wasn't a whole lot there.”The Blue Devils never trailed, leading by as many as 14 points and keeping the Cavaliers — playing a methodical pace and their own defensive-minded style — working to inch closer all night.Reece Beekman scored 12 points for Virginia, which drew to within six on Isaac McKneely's 3-pointer with 3:05 and five on Kihei Clark's layup off a scramble with 1:07 left. Finally, Beekman pulled Virginia to within 53-49 on a driving layup around Filipowski with 44 seconds left.But the Blue Devils didn't wobble, hitting six straight free throws to clinch this one. Roach hit four of those, turning in a veteran's composure on a freshman-laden team reminiscent of some of his big postseason moments during last year's Final Four run.Scheyer finally started to wave his arm to the Duke fans behind the bench for noise with freshman Mark Mitchell preparing to go to the line for the final free throws with 22.1 seconds left.Moments later, Scheyer began exchanging handshakes and high-fives with his staff as Proctor began dribbling out the clock. The horn sounded and Proctor flung the ball skyward, screaming as the players began to mob each other for the first title in Duke's new era.BIG PICTUREDuke: Offense had been the story for Duke through the first two games in the tournament, with the Blue Devils beating Pittsburgh and No. 14 Miami while averaging 90.5 points and shooting 58.7% and tallying 43 assists. Duke shot 42% this time, but the defense made Virginia work for everything.Virginia: The Cavaliers were seeking their fourth ACC Tournament title and third under coach Tony Bennett, whose first title came here against Krzyzewski's Blue Devils in 2014. After sharing the regular-season title with the Hurricanes, the Cavaliers beat North Carolina and Clemson to reach the final despite losing starting forward Ben Vander Plas to a season-ending injury on the eve of the tournament. That altered the rotation here in Greensboro, with Kadin Shedrick seeing more minutes inside, and it will force more adjustments for the NCAA Tournament ahead.TIP-INSFilipowski went scoreless in the controversial first meeting on 0-for-6 shooting. ... McKneely added 10 points for Virginia, including a pair of 3-pointers. ... Veteran Virginia point guard Kihei Clark struggled to six points on 1-for-9 shooting. ... The Cavaliers' 17 first-half points matched the lowest-ever output in any ACC final.___Follow Aaron Beard on Twitter at https://twitter.com/aaronbeardap___AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/college-basketball and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/13,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833032,Curry leads Warriors to OT win over NBA-leading Bucks,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Stephen Curry scored 36 points with 22 of those in the fourth quarter and overtime, shining in his first home game back from a long injury absence and leading the Golden State Warriors past the NBA-best Milwaukee Bucks 125-116 on Saturday night.Curry hit a tying 3-pointer with 19 seconds left in regulation, then blocked a layup attempt by Jrue Holiday in the closing moments. The Warriors got the ball back with 1.9 seconds remaining and Curry inbounded to Draymond Green, who missed from deep.Holiday had put Milwaukee up on a 3 with 32.7 seconds to play and wound up with 18 points, nine rebounds and eight assists. But the Bucks, playing without star Giannis Antetokounmpo, had their three-game winning streak snapped with just their second defeat in 21 games since Jan. 21.Thompson added 22 points, Donte DiVincenzo had 20 points and 10 rebounds and the Warriors won at home for the seventh in a row and 11th in 12.Khris Middleton had 19 points and five assists, Bobby Portis contributed 15 points and 13 rebounds and Brook Lopez 19 points and seven boards for Milwaukee.CELTICS 134, HAWKS 125ATLANTA (AP) — Jayson Tatum led a balanced attack by scoring 11 of his 34 points in the fourth quarter, and Boston overcame Atlanta’s fourth-quarter comeback bid.The Celtics opened a six-game trip by having six players score in double figures. Jaylen Brown had 24 points. Tatum added 15 rebounds.Trae Young had 35 points and 13 assists for Atlanta, which could not maintain momentum following back-to-back wins at Washington. The Hawks remain eighth in the Eastern Conference standings.With 1:25 remaining and Boston leading 129-121, Young and Marcus Smart had to be separated after the two were entangled and fell to the court under the Celtics’ basket. Smart was called for an initial foul before a lengthy review by the officials called both players for technical fouls and ejected Smart. Young made two free throws to cut the deficit to six points.CLIPPERS 106, KNICKS 95LOS ANGELES (AP) — Kawhi Leonard scored 38 points and the Los Angeles Clippers pulled away in the fourth quarter to beat New York.Paul George added 22 points for the Clippers, who have won three straight after dropping five in a row.It was Leonard’s seventh straight game with at least 21 points, and he is averaging 31 points during that stretch. He also has four 30-point games during that span.Immanuel Quickley had 26 points and 10 rebounds for the Knicks, who have dropped three straight after a nine-game winning streak. Quickley started in place of Jalen Brunson, who was sidelined with a sore left foot. Julius Randle scored 19 despite shooting 5 of 24.PACERS 121, PISTONS 115DETROIT (AP) — Jalen Smith scored 11 of his 20 points in the fourth quarter and Indiana beat Detroit to extend the Pistons’ losing streak to 11 games.Isaiah Jackson added 19 points and 11 rebounds for Indiana, which improved to 5-2 in its last seven games.Isaiah Livers had a career-high 18 points for Detroit, which dropped to a league-worst 15-53. Killian Hayes had 17 points and 13 assists.The Pistons were missing five of their top six scorers; Hayes was the only one in the lineup. The Pacers played without Tyrese Haliburton, Bennedict Mathurin and Myles Turner.MAGIC 126, HEAT 114, OTORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — Wendell Carter had 27 points and 11 rebounds and Orlando bounced back from a fourth-quarter collapse to beat Miami in overtime.Jimmy Butler scored 38 points for the Heat, including 15 in the final six minutes of the fourth quarter when Miami overcame a 15-point deficit. Butler’s 3-pointer at the buzzer sent the game to overtime.The finish of the fourth quarter included a wild sequence during which Paolo Banchero’s foul on a 3-point attempt by Butler with 14.5 seconds left was overturned by a replay.Banchero had 17 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists for the Magic. Franz Wagner had 17 points and eight rebounds before leaving with an ankle injury early in the fourth quarter.BULLS 119, ROCKETS 111HOUSTON (AP) — Zach LaVine scored 36 points and DeMar DeRozan added 27 as Chicago used a huge run in the fourth quarter to top the Rockets.The Bulls trailed by four midway through the fourth before going on a 13-0 run for a 115-106 lead with two minutes remaining.DeRozan, who had seven rebounds and five assists, scored the first four points in the run and LaVine scored the next four. LaVine’s second basket in that span came on an alley-oop from DeRozan, and former Rocket Patrick Beverley capped the run with a 3-pointer.It’s the second straight victory for the Bulls, who got 18 points and 11 rebounds from Nikola Vucevic and 16 points and 10 rebounds from Beverley. LaVine had nine rebounds and five assists.Rookie Jabari Smith Jr. had 20 points and 10 rebounds for the Western Conference-worst Rockets, who dropped their third in a row.GRIZZLIES 112, MAVERICKS 108MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) — Rookie David Roddy scored a career-high 24 points, including 17 points in the fourth quarter, and Memphis rallied past short-handed Dallas.Roddy connected on 7 of 8 shots in the fourth, including 3 of 4 from outside the arc. Desmond Bane led the Grizzlies with 25 points, while Jaren Jackson Jr. finished with 14 points.Tim Hardaway Jr. lead the Mavericks with 23 points, while Jaden Hardy finished with 22. Josh Green added 21 points for Dallas.Two of the NBA’s biggest stars — the Mavericks’ Luka Doncic and Memphis’ Ja Morant — were absent from the game. Doncic has a left thigh strain, while Morant is away from the team after posting a video last weekend in which he appeared to be displaying a gun at a Denver-area strip club.THUNDER 110, PELICANS 96NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 35 points and Oklahoma City defeated undermanned New Orleans for its fourth victory in five games.Josh Giddey added 19 points and Jalen Williams had 17 for the Thunder, who led most of the way and by as many as 21 in the first half. Gilgeous-Alexander, who did not attempt a 3-pointer, hit 11 of 23 shots and made all 13 of his free throws.Already struggling during All-Star power forward Zion Williamson’s extended injury absence, New Orleans also played without high-scoring wing Brandon Ingram, who entered the day listed as questionable after leaving a game Wednesday with a right ankle sprain. CJ McCollum scored 26 points to lead the Pelicans.KINGS 128, SUNS 119PHOENIX (AP) — Harrison Barnes scored 19 points, De’Aaron Fox and Malik Monk each added 18 and Sacramento used a balanced effort to beat Phoenix and snap the Suns' four-game winning streak.The Kings moved 3 1/2 games ahead of the Suns for the No. 3 seed in the Western Conference playoff race. Domantas Sabonis had 17 points and a team-high eight rebounds for Sacramento, which ended the game on a 13-4 run.The Suns were playing their second straight game without recently-acquired star Kevin Durant, who hurt his ankle during pregame warmups before Wednesday’s game. The team says he has a sprained left ankle and will be re-evaluated in three weeks.Devin Booker scored 28 points on 11-for-19 shooting for Phoenix. Deandre Ayton had 22 points and 12 rebounds, and Chris Paul added 16 points and 16 assists.JAZZ 119, HORNETS 111CHARLOTTE, N.C.

(AP) — Joaquín Torres scored in the 90th minute to rally the Philadelphia Union to a 1-0 victory over the Chicago Fire on Saturday night.Andre Blake made the start in goal for the Union before leaving with a leg injury in the 33rd minute. He was replaced by Joe Bendik, who completed the clean sheet. Chris Brady made one save for the Fire.Torres' match-winner came with an assist from José Martínez.The Fire were forced to play a man down after Fabian Herbers received a red card in the 50th minute. Chicago’s Kei Kamara received a red card in the third minute of second-half stoppage time.Philadelphia (2-1-0) has now won 13 straight home matches, dating to last season and including the playoffs. Only San Jose had a longer home streak. The Earthquakes won 14 straight spanning the 2001-02 seasons. The Union's 24-match unbeaten streak at home is the fourth longest in league history.Chicago (0-1-1) made it 14 straight seasons without winning a home opener in a 1-1 draw with NYCFC last week. The Fire have only won one of its first two matches in a season once — a 2-0 win over Real Salt Lake in 2017. Chicago ended last season with a 3-2-2 record in its last seven road matches after going 3-26-9 in its previous 38.Philadelphia outshot Chicago 14-12 with a 3-2 edge in shots on goal.Both teams next play Saturday.

Taipower was able to transfer power, with 1,523 households having power restored almost immediately, while another 1,350 households had power restored by 10:03 p.m.However, it was not until 1:02 a.m. on Monday (March 13) that power was completely restored to all affected households, the report said.Taipower noted poor night time visibility and inclement weather made repairs difficult, leading to a longer than expected power outage for many households. Taipower apologized for the incident and promised to strengthen maintenance and inspection of power distribution equipment to reduce the frequency of power outages.In addition to the substation incident, four separate reports of sparks or electrical arcing were reported. Each incident involved electrical poles in the Guanyin District, but none of the sparking incidents caused a power outage.Taipower said sparks were caused by salt spray in coastal areas accumulating on power line insulators. After long periods of good weather, salt can adhere to electrical poles and electrical equipment, with a slight drizzle causing abnormal leakage, discharges, or arcing.To prevent such incidents from occurring, electrical pole insulators are regularly cleaned with purified water.",2023/03/13,736,Society

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833088,West Virginia GOP Legislature passes transgender care ban,"CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) — A bill that would ban evidence-based health care for transgender minors in West Virginia, the state estimated to have more transgender youth per capita than any other in the nation, is headed to the desk of Gov. Jim Justice.The Republican governor has not taken a public stance on the measure and it's unclear whether he will sign it into law. A spokesperson said he was unavailable for comment Saturday.A 2017 study by UCLA Law’s The Williams Institute estimated West Virginia had the highest per capita rate of transgender youth in the country.Every major medical organization, including the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Psychiatric Association, supports gender-affirming care for youths.But lawmakers in West Virginia and other states advancing bans on transgender health care for youth and young adults often characterize gender-affirming treatments as medically unproven, potentially dangerous in the long term and a symptom of “woke” culture.The bill in West Virginia would outlaw those under 18 from being prescribed hormone therapy and fully reversible medication for suspending the physical changes of puberty, allowing patients and parents time to make future decisions about hormone therapy.The legislation also includes a ban on gender-affirming surgery for minors, something medical professionals emphasize does not happen in West Virginia anyway.The bill contains significant exemptions to the medication therapy ban for people under the age of 18 at risk for suicide, provisions added in the final week of the 60-day legislative session, which ended Saturday.The changes, made at the urging of Senate Majority Leader Tom Takubo, who is a physician, would allow some transgender youth to continue receiving medical interventions under certain circumstances, including hormone therapy if they experience severe gender dysphoria.Gender dysphoria is defined by medical professionals as severe psychological distress experienced by those whose gender identity differs from their sex assigned at birth.During a speech on the Senate floor late Friday night, Takubo referenced 17 peer-reviewed studies showing a significant decrease in the rates of suicide ideation and suicide attempts among youth with severe gender dysphoria who have access to medication therapy.“These kids struggle, they have incredible difficulties,” he said.The rate of suicide ideation, or having suicidal thoughts or ideas, for transgender youth in Virginia is three times higher than the rate for all youth in the state, according to research complied by West Virginia University Medicine physicians using West Virginia Youth Risk Behavior Survey data.The version of the bill first passed by West Virginia’s Republican supermajority House of Delegates last month contained no exemptions for mental health.The House on Saturday unanimously approved the Senate's changes. The amended bill then passed 88-10, with all ‘no’ votes coming from the body's shrinking delegation of Democrats.Democratic Del. Ric Griffith, who was the only legislator who spoke on the floor about the measure, voiced support for the mental health exemptions and was later one of only two lawmakers in the minority party to vote for the amended bill.“We talk a lot about, ‘Parents know what’s best for their children,'” the Wayne County lawmaker said. ""This is a fairly narrow allowance when a child could potentially be suicidal.""Under the amended bill, a person below the age of 18 would need to be diagnosed with severe gender dysphoria by at least two medical or mental health providers to gain access to medication therapy, including a mental health provider or adolescent medicine specialist.The dosage must be the lowest possible necessary to “treat the psychiatric condition and not for purposes of gender alteration,” according to the bill.Providers must be specifically trained to diagnose and treat severe gender dysphoria in adolescents and provide written testimony saying medical interventions are necessary to prevent or limit possible or actual self-harm. The minor’s parents or guardians would be required to give written consent to the treatments.Hormonal therapy could not be provided to minors before the age of puberty, something West Virginia physicians say doesn’t happen anyway.The bill includes exceptions originating in the House version for individuals born with a “medically verifiable disorder,” including people with ambiguous “external biological sex characteristics"" and for people taking treatments for infection, injury, disease or disorder that has been “caused by or exacerbated by the performance of gender transition procedures.”People also can access treatment if they are in “imminent danger of death, or impairment of a major bodily function unless surgery is performed.”The vote to send the bill to the governor came two days after a crowd of protesters descended on the state Capitol, where cries of “trans kids matter” could be heard from the Senate chamber as lawmakers debated bills.Democratic Del. Danielle Walker, the Legislature's only openly LGBTQ member, led chants of the state motto: “Mountaineers are always free.”",2023/03/13,,World

Gilgeous-Alexander, who did not attempt a 3-pointer, hit 11 of 23 shots and made all 13 of his free throws.“His mid-range game is up with the best in the league,” Giddey said of Gilgeous-Alexander, who has scored 30 or more points in 12 of his last 16 games. ""He's crafty on the block in the mid-post, finishes well and gets fouled a lot. So he's got a very deep bag. He's got a lot of weapons he goes to and you see there's not a lot of guys in this league who can cover him one-on-one.“When he's hot, when he's getting to his spots and knocking down shots, he's probably the toughest player in the league to guard at this point,” Giddey added.Already struggling during All-Star power forward Zion Williamson's extended injury absence, New Orleans also played without high-scoring wing Brandon Ingram, who entered the day listed as questionable after leaving a game Wednesday with a right ankle sprain.CJ McCollum scored 26 points for the Pelicans, who entered the fourth quarter down by 15 and cut the Thunder's lead to nine with more than five minutes remaining.Thunder reserve Isaiah Joe's third 3 of the game seemed to stunt New Orleans' momentum. Soon after, Giddey's 9-foot floater and Gilgeous-Alexander's step-back jumper sealed the victory.“It’s hard to hold a lead for the whole game on the road the way we did tonight,” Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said. “We held them off with sound execution on both ends.”Naji Marshall and Trey Murphy III each scored 15 points for New Orleans. Jonas Valanciunas added 13 points for the Pelicans, while Jaxson Hayes had 11 points and two blocked shots.But the Pelicans were done in by turnovers. They committed 22, leading to 23 Thunder points. Gilgeous-Alexander had four steals.By contrast, New Orleans turned 12 Thunder turnovers into just eight points.“We just didn’t bring it tonight — no excuses,” Pelicans coach Willie Green said. “We didn’t come out and match their energy on our home floor and take pride in these games. We came out lax and turned the ball over too much.“We can help ourselves by simply outplaying teams and playing smart,"" Green added. ""Our margin for error is small when we have guys out. ... We can't kill oursleves like that.”The result pulled Oklahoma City even with New Orleans in the standings at 32-35. Both clubs sat just a half-game behind Utah (33-35) for 10th place and the final play-in spot in the Western Conference.TIP-INSThunder: Finished with an 18-10 advantage in fast-break points. ... Shot 46.3% (37 of 80), including 9 of 28 from 3-point range. ... Outscored New Orleans in the paint, 48-36. ... Outscored the Pelicans 27-16 from the foul line.Pelicans: Have a 9-21 record since Williamson went out with an injured right hamstring on Jan. 2. ... Fell to 8-11 in games without both Williamson and Ingram. ... Outrebounded the Thunder 43-38. ... Shot 42% (34 of 81), including 12 of 34 from beyond the arc.HAPPY RETURNWilliams missed Oklahoma City's previous two games with a sprained right wrist and Daigneault was particularly pleased by the way Williams defended Valanciunas in the paint.“He did a great job on Valanciunas. Everything Valanciunas got was earned. He was really physical with him, met him and got him off his spots,"" Daigneault said.

A 2018 Kilauea eruption destroyed more than 700 residences.For about two weeks last December, Hawaii's biggest volcano, Mauna Loa, also was erupting on Hawaii's Big Island.The dual eruptions of Hawaii's biggest volcanos provided a temporary boost to tourism during the slow season.Volcanic eruptions have deep spiritual and cultural significance for Native Hawaiians. When Mauna Loa started erupting in November after lying dormant for 38 years, many Hawaiians took part in cultural traditions such as singing, chanting and dancing to honor Pele, the deity of volcanoes and fire, and leaving offerings known as “hookupu.”",2023/03/13,,World

Jrue had a straight line drive to the rim,” Draymond Green said.The Warriors got the ball back with 1.9 seconds remaining and Curry inbounded to Green, who missed from deep though he thought for sure it was “cash.”Holiday had put Milwaukee up on a 3 with 32.7 seconds to play and wound up with 18 points, nine rebounds and eight assists. But the Bucks (48-19), playing without star Giannis Antetokounmpo, had their three-game winning streak snapped with just their second defeat in 21 games since Jan. 21.“I loved this game. I thought we competed the entire time,” coach Steve Kerr said. “I thought we were really solid for most of the night.”Curry’s 3 with 1:08 remaining in regulation got Golden State within 108-106. A steal by Klay Thompson on the other end moments later led to a tying layup by Curry before Holiday delivered.“Overtime and fourth quarter, he got away from us a little bit,” Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said of Curry. “Some of them were high level.”Thompson added 22 points, Donte DiVincenzo had 20 points and 10 rebounds and the Warriors won at home for the seventh in a row and 11th in 12.Curry loved making a difference on the defensive end.“To hit a couple big shots down the stretch and then find yourself in a position where you can make a play on the other side, it gives everybody a good boost because it's shocking,” Curry said. “I think I got more about that in the locker room than any shot I made tonight, which speaks for itself.”Khris Middleton had 19 points and five assists, Bobby Portis contributed 15 points and 13 rebounds and Brook Lopez 19 points, seven boards and five blocks.Bucks leading scorer and rebounder Antetokounmpo missed his second straight game with right hand soreness and third overall after sitting out March 7 with a non-COVID illness.Golden State used a 16-4 burst out of halftime to go ahead 66-53 but the Bucks fought back to get within 80-77 heading into the fourth.Green went down hard and limped to the locker room midway through the third quarter before returning with 38.7 seconds left. While cutting through the key, Green's left foot got tangled with Holiday's right leg and Green tripped and rolled his ankle.While sore, “I will 100% expect to play,” Green said of Monday's game with Phoenix.Green finished with five points, 13 rebounds and nine assists and Golden State shot better from beyond the arc (41.8%) than it did inside (40.4%).Curry returned March 5 at the Lakers from a left leg injury suffered Feb. 4 that sidelined him for 11 games. He played on the team's three-game road trip.DiVincenzo has learned that anything Curry lets fly has a chance.“It’s super fun to watch,” he said. “Sometimes when it leaves his hand I’m like, ‘No way.’”KLAY'S GIFTThompson presented soon-to-be 16-year-old Braulio Noriega with a birthday surprise: a custom-basketball wheelchair. Noriega had his left leg amputated from above the knee because of cancer as a 6-year-old.The teen hopes to compete playing wheelchair basketball in college and eventually in his home country of Mexico.“I can't even describe how I felt,” an overjoyed Noriega said. “... There's so much emotional energy from him.”TIP-INSBucks: Milwaukee shot just 9 of 25 on 3s in the first half to 10 for 24 by the Warriors. Allen missed his initial five and shot 2 of 9 overall. ... The Bucks managed just seven offensive rebounds to the Warriors' 18.Warriors: JaMychal Green scored 11 of his 18 points in the first quarter for Golden State making three 3-pointers. ... Golden State had 33 assists — its 35th game with 30 or more to tie the Nuggets for most in the NBA. ...

They were the ""last two cartons in the convenience store,"" according to Liberty Times.Yeh put the eggs into her bicycle basket, but she remembered she needed something else and ran back into the convenience store, according to an account of the incident posted on the Facebook group ""Xizhi Group.""However, when she came out, she discovered the cartons were missing from her basket. At 9:50 a.m., Yeh told police the eggs had been stolen from her bicycle, which had been parked outside a store on Fude 1st Road.Although there were no surveillance cameras outside the store, police were able to access footage from nearby cameras in the area. They spotted a 61-year-old man surnamed Kuo (郭) walking in the area carrying the two cartons at the time of the incident.A man surnamed Kuo is escorted by a police officer. (CNA photo)After conducting a search for Kuo, police went to his residence at 1:40 p.m. When Xizhi Precinct police questioned Kuo, he confessed to the crime and handed over the two boxes with their contents ""unscathed.""After officers took Kuo into the police station for more questioning, the eggs were returned to Yeh. Kuo was then transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office to be investigated for Offenses of Larceny (竊盜罪), the report said.In her description of the incident posted after Kuo's arrest, Yeh said she tried PX Mart, Carrefour, the market, and Simple Mart, but could not find any eggs. It was not until she tried a convenience store that she found two cartons which she bought for NT$172.Yeh said she thought it was a small matter and did not want to waste police resources, but because it was reported to the police and larceny is a publicly prosecutable offense, they investigated the case. Police reminded the public to carry valuables and personal items with them at all times to avoid theft.",2023/03/13,4428,Society
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833109,"VHIS is more than tax deductions, be mindful of the calculation and get insured wisely","HONG KONG SAR -  Media OutReach - 13 March 2023 - Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme (VHIS) policyholders are eligible to claim up to HK$8,000 for tax deduction. If we use a tax rate of 17% for calculation, the total tax deduction exceeds HK$1,300. However, many policyholders focus on saving the most tax, but neglecting the actual premium paid, and end up saving less money.   VHIS Tax Deduction Claimable Limit & Calculation   Each policyholder and taxpayer can claim up to HK$8,000 of  VHIS premium for tax deduction. If the annual VHIS premium exceeds this amount, only HK$8,000 can be claimed.   The tax deduction amount is calculated as below -       Formula              VHIS premium paid during the assessment year                    X Tax Rate                    = Actual Tax Deduction Amount              Example              HK$8,000                  （Tax Deduction Claimable Limit ）                    X 17%                  （Assuming the Tax Rate is 17%*）                    = HK$1,360              *The tax rate varies between policyholders, depending on the salary.   Many may think choosing a  VHIS with higher premium allows them to enjoy higher tax deduction, and save more money. However, it is not the case.   Instead of saving tax, you spend more for a more expensive VHIS plan with similar Protection   Formula shows policyholders could enjoy higher tax deduction with more expensive plans.   However, Bowtie's calculations show that the most cost-effective way is to purchase a  Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme (VHIS) Policy with a lower premium but adequate protection.            Case 1: Purchase a more expensive VHIS plan^   Case 2: Purchase a more affordable VHIS plan^      Tax Deduction Claimable Limit            HK$8,000                    HK$3,372              Tax Deduction Amount  （Assuming the Tax Rate is 17%*）            HK$8,000 x 17%                  = HK$1,360                    HK$3,372 x 17%                  = HK$607              Yearly Expenses  （Actual Paid Premium - Tax Deduction Amount）            HK$8,000 – HK$1,360                  =          HK$6,640            HK$3,372 – HK$607                  =HK$2,765      *The tax rate varies between policyholders, depending on the salary.  ^ VHIS with similar protection   From the yearly expenses, we could see case 2 saved two times more money than case 1.   Most money is saved when the family member with the highest income applies for the tax deduction as the Policyholder    Higher the income, higher the tax rate. If the family member with the highest income purchases VHIS for the whole family, and applies for tax deduction, most money will be saved.   Bowtie will demonstrate the internal calculations with an example from Case 2.            Case 2    Case 2 - Family Member a    Case 2 - Family Member b    Case 2 - Family Member c      Tax Deduction Claimable Limit            HK$3,372                    HK$4,476                    HK$1,920                    HK$2,196              Tax Deduction Amount  （Assuming the Tax Rate is 17%*）            HK$3,372 x 17%                  = HK$607                    HK$4,476 x 17%                  = HK$761                    HK$1,920 x 17%                  = HK$326                    HK$2,196 x 17%                  = HK$373              Yearly Expenses  （Actual Paid Premium - Tax Deduction Amount）            HK$3,372 - HK$607                  = HK$2,765            HK$4,476 - HK$761                  =          HK$3,715            HK$1,920 - HK$326                  =          HK$1,594            HK$2,196 - HK$373                  =          HK$1,823      *The tax rate varies between policyholders, depending on the salary.   From the above demonstration, we could see that if one member of the family purchased VHIS for the other three members, they could save HK$1,460 more tax than before (versus saving only HK$607 for one member).   Last Tip - The most ""money-saving"" way is to...   The family member with the highest salary should purchase VHIS for the entire family and claim for tax deduction. Then, when choosing a plan, choose a plan with similar protection but a lower premium.  Hashtag: #Bowtie #vhis #insurance

Such factors include, but are not limited to:           current and future market conditions, including fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rates, inflation (including resulting interest rate rises), sustained high or low interest rate environments, the performance of financial and credit markets generally and the impact of economic uncertainty, slowdown or contraction (including as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and related or other geopolitical tensions and conflicts), which may also impact policyholder behaviour and reduce product affordability;             asset valuation impacts from the transition to a lower carbon economy;             derivative instruments not effectively mitigating any exposures;             global political uncertainties, including the potential for increased friction in cross-border trade and the exercise of laws, regulations and executive powers to restrict trade, financial transactions, capital movements and/or investment;             the longer-term impacts of Covid-19, including macro-economic impacts on financial market volatility and global economic activity and impacts on sales, claims, assumptions and increased product lapses;             the policies and actions of regulatory authorities, including, in particular, the policies and actions of the Hong Kong Insurance Authority, as Prudential's Group-wide supervisor, as well as the degree and pace of regulatory changes and new government initiatives generally;             given Prudential's designation as an Internationally Active Insurance Group, the impact on Prudential of systemic risk and other group supervision policy standards adopted by the International Association of Insurance Supervisors;             the physical, social, morbidity/health and financial impacts of climate change and global health crises, which may impact Prudential's business, investments, operations and its duties owed to customers;             legal, policy and regulatory developments in response to climate change and broader sustainability-related issues, including the development of regulations and standards and interpretations such as those relating to ESG reporting, disclosures and product labelling and their interpretations (which may conflict and create misrepresentation risks);             the collective ability of governments, policymakers, the Group, industry and other stakeholders to implement and adhere to commitments on mitigation of climate change and broader sustainability-related issues effectively (including not appropriately considering the interests of all Prudential's stakeholders or failing to maintain high standards of corporate governance and responsible business practices);             the impact of competition and fast-paced technological change;             the effect on Prudential's business and results from, in particular, mortality and morbidity trends, lapse rates and policy renewal rates;             the timing, impact and other uncertainties of future acquisitions or combinations within relevant industries;             the impact of internal transformation projects and other strategic actions failing to meet their objectives or adversely impacting the Group's employees;             the availability and effectiveness of reinsurance for Prudential's businesses;             the risk that Prudential's operational resilience (or that of its suppliers and partners) may prove to be inadequate, including in relation to operational disruption due to external events;             disruption to the availability, confidentiality or integrity of Prudential's information technology, digital systems and data (or those of its suppliers and partners) including the Pulse platform;             the increased non-financial and financial risks and uncertainties associated with operating joint ventures with independent partners, particularly where joint ventures are not controlled by Prudential;             the impact of changes in capital, solvency standards, accounting standards or relevant regulatory frameworks, and tax and other legislation and regulations in the jurisdictions in which Prudential and its affiliates operate; and             the impact of legal and regulatory actions, investigations and disputes.           These factors are not exhaustive. Prudential operates in a continually changing business environment with new risks emerging from time to time that it may be unable to predict or that it currently does not expect to have a material adverse effect on its business. In addition, these and other important factors may, for example, result in changes to assumptions used for determining results of operations or re-estimations of reserves for future policy benefits.

In addition, it works with local NGOs and the public to compensate for the lack of capacity and a need for bird rehabilitation and adoption services.The office said it frequently receives reports of injured or sick wild birds, lost pet birds, and those that have been abandoned. After receiving such reports from the public, trained animal rescue personnel will travel to the location of the injured or lost bird and bring it back for diagnosis, treatment, or resettlement.Many abandoned pet birds need foster homes. (New Taipei City Gov't photo)It will also assist bird owners seeking to find lost pet birds.In the case of injured wild birds, many cannot be returned to the wild as they may need continued sheltering. Also, many lost pet birds are not successfully reunited with their owners, meaning adoption services are the only option for such birds.Given the increase in cases, New Taipei City sought qualified partners to help provide care for these birds. A small team of experts from Taipei Zoo and National Taiwan University helped select NGOs to participate in a surrogate care program, ultimately choosing Taiwan Bird Rescue Association and the Taiwan Treasured Bird Alliance.After consulting with these NGOs, regulations were put in place for bird adoption. Schools and institutions will be given priority when it comes to exotic birds and special pet varieties. If no schools or such institutions step forward within 14 days, the general public will be allowed to adopt, with NGOs conducting owner suitability evaluation.Injured wildlife needs to be nurtured back to good health. (New Taipei City Gov't photo)New Taipei City hopes this collaborative venture can provide lost or injured birds with a better living environment, companionship and care from volunteers, and eventually a better life.If the public encounter birds that are injured or need to be rescued, they are encouraged to call the 24-hour animal rescue hotline operated by New Taipei City Animal Protection and Health Inspection Office at 02-2959-6353. Upon receiving the call, personnel will be dispatched.",2023/03/13,883,Environment

After more than two years of pandemic, global economy began to recover, entering 2022, the Russian Federations invasion of Ukraine and its global effects on commodity markets, supply chains, inflation, and financial conditions have steepened the slowdown in global growth. In particular, the war in Ukraine is leading to soaring prices and volatility in energy markets, with improvements in activity in energy exporters more than offset by headwinds to activity in most other economies. The invasion of Ukraine has also led to a significant increase in agricultural commodity prices, which is exacerbating food insecurity and extreme poverty in many emerging market and developing economies.Numerous risks could further derail what is now a precarious recovery. Among them is, in particular, the possibility of stubbornly high global inflation accompanied by tepid growth, reminiscent of the stagflation of the 1970s. This could eventually result in a sharp tightening of monetary policy in advanced economies to rein in inflation, lead to surging borrowing costs, and possibly culminate in financial stress in some emerging market and developing economies. A forceful and wide-ranging policy response is required by policy makers in these economies and the global community to boost growth, bolster macroeconomic frameworks, reduce financial vulnerabilities, provide support to vulnerable population groups, and attenuate the long-term impacts of the global shocks of recent years.Download Free Sample of This Strategic Report:- https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=bis347659In this complex international situation, Report Ocean published Wearable Devices in Healthcare Market Status, Trends and COVID-19 Impact Report 2022, which provides a comprehensive analysis of the global market , This Report covers the manufacturer data, including: sales volume, price, revenue, gross margin, business distribution etc., these data help the consumer know about the competitors better.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833179,Schwarber's 3-run homer sends U.S. past Britain in WBC,"PHOENIX (AP) — Kyle Schwarber launched a three-run homer, Nolan Arenado had three hits and two RBIs, and the United States overcame a slow start to beat Britain 6-2 on Saturday night in the World Baseball Classic opener for both teams.Trayce Thompson put Britain up 1-0 in the first inning with a homer off Adam Wainwright that just cleared the left-center wall. Thompson — who plays for the Los Angeles Dodgers — is one of the few players on Britain’s roster with big league experience.Thompson’s drive briefly put a damper on the mood for the crowd of 39,650 at Chase Field, but the Americans weren’t down long.The U.S. grabbed a 2-1 lead in the third and then broke the game open in the fourth on Schwarber’s shot that landed in the stands near the swimming pool that sits behind the right-center fence at Chase Field.In Tokyo, Shohei Ohtani had another RBI double, 21-year-old right-hander Roki Sasaki reached 100 mph 21 times in 66 pitches and Japan beat the Czech Republic 10-2 on Saturday night to clinch a quarterfinal berth.Shugo Maki hit his second home run of the tournament and new Boston Red Sox outfielder Masataka Yoshida had three RBIs, including a go-ahead, two-run double in the third inning off loser Ondrej Satoria as the Samurai Warriors overcame a 1-0 deficit.Ohtani went 1 for 3 with a walk before a crowd of 41,637 in the Tokyo Dome, leaving for a pinch hitter in the eighth inning.

He also has pitched four scoreless innings.Sasaki struck out eight in 3 2/3 innings and got the win. He allowed an unearned run, two hits and two walks.Sasaki threw the 16th perfect game in Japanese major league history in April, then pitched eight perfect innings in his next start before being pulled after 102 pitches.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833180,"'Everything' wins best picture, is everywhere at Oscars","LOS ANGELES (AP) — The metaphysical multiverse comedy “Everything Everywhere All at Once” wrapped its hot dog fingers around Hollywood’s top prize Sunday, winning best picture at the 95th Academy Awards, along with awards for Michelle Yeoh, Ke Huy Quan and Jamie Lee Curtis.Though worlds away from Oscar bait, Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert’s anarchic ballet of everything bagels, googly-eyed rocks and one messy tax audit emerged as an improbable Academy Awards heavyweight. The indie hit, A24’s second best picture winner following “Moonlight,” won seven Oscars in all. Only two other films in Oscar history — “A Streetcar Named Desire” and “Network” — won three acting Academy Awards.Fifty years after “The Godfather” won at the Oscars, “Everything Everywhere All at Once” triumphed with a much different immigrant experience. Its eccentric tale about a Chinese immigrant family — just the second feature by the Daniels, as the filmmaking duo is known — blended science fiction and alternate realities in the story of an ordinary woman and laundromat owner.“The world is changing rapidly and I fear our stories are not keeping that pace,” said Kwan, who shared best director and best original screenplay with Scheinert. “Sometimes it’s a little scary knowing that movies move at the rate of years and the world on the internet is moving at the rate of milliseconds. But I have great faith in our stories.”Yeoh became the first Asian woman to win best actress, taking the award for her lauded performance in “Everything Everywhere All at Once.” The 60-year-old Malaysian-born Yeoh won her first Oscar for a performance that relied as much on her comic and dramatic chops as it did her kung fu skills. It's the first best actress win for a non-white actress in 20 years.“Ladies, don't let anyone ever tell you you're past your prime,” said Yeoh, who received a raucous standing ovation.“Everything Everywhere,” released all the way back in March 2022, helped revive arthouse cinemas after two years of pandemic, racking up more than $100 million in ticket sales with scant initial expectations of Oscar glory. In winning best director, the Daniels — both 35 years old — are just the third directing pair to win the award, following Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins (“West Side Story”) and Joel and Ethan Coen (“No Country for Old Men”). Scheinert dedicated the award “to the moms of the world.”Best actor went to Brendan Fraser, culminating the former action star’s return to center stage for his physical transformation as a 600-lb. reclusive professor in “The Whale.” The best-actor race had been one of the closest contests of the night, but Fraser in the end edged out Austin Butler.“So this is what the multiverse looks like,” said a clearly moved Fraser, pointing to the “Everything Everywhere All at Once” crew.“Everything Everywhere All at Once,” a shock of freshness in a movie industry awash in sequels and reboots, helped Hollywood turn the page from one of the most infamous moments in Oscar history: The Slap. Jimmy Kimmel, hosting for the third time, pledged a ceremony with “no nonsense."" He said anyone who wanted to “get jiggy with it” this year would have to come through a fearsome battalion of bodyguards, including Yeoh, Steven Spielberg and his show’s “security guard” Guillermo Rodriguez.The former child star Quan capped his own extraordinary comeback with the Oscar for best supporting actor for his performance in the indie hit “Everything Everywhere All at Once.” Quan, beloved for his roles as Short Round in “Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom” and Data in “Goonies,” had all but given up acting before being cast in “Everything Everywhere All at Once.”His win, among the most expected of the night, was nevertheless one of the ceremony's most moving moments. The audience — including his “Temple of Doom” director, Steven Spielberg — gave Quan a standing ovation as he fought back tears.“Mom, I just won an Oscar!” said Quan, 51, whose family fled Vietnam in the war when he was a child.“They say stories like this only happen in the movies. I can't believe it's happening,” said Quan. ""This is the American dream.""Minutes later, Quan's castmate Jamie Lee Curtis won for best supporting actress. Her win, in one of the most competitive categories this year, denied a victory for comic-book fans. Angela Bassett (“Black Panther: Wakanda Forever”) would have been the first performer to win an Oscar for a Marvel movie. Curtis is the rare Oscar winner whose parents were both Oscar nominees: Tony Curtis was nominated for “The Defiant Ones” in 1959 and Janet Leigh was nominated in 1961 for “Psycho.”The German-language WWI epic “All Quiet on the Western Front” — Netflix’s top contender this year — took four awards as the academy heaped honors on the craft of the harrowing anti-war film. It won for cinematography, production design, score and best international film.Though Bassett missed on supporting actress, Ruth E. Carter won for the costume design of “Wakanda Forever,” four years after becoming the first Black designer to win an Oscar, for “Black Panther.” This one makes Carter the first Black woman to win two Oscars.“Thank you to the Academy for recognizing the superhero that is a Black woman,” said Carter. “She endures, she loves, she overcomes, she is every woman in this film.”ABC's telecast opened traditionally: with a montage of the year's films (with Kimmel edited into a cockpit in “Top Gun: Maverick"") and a lengthy monologue. Kimmel struggled to find lessons from the year's prior scandal when Will Smith smacked presenter Chris Rock, and went on to win best actor. If anyone tried any violence this year, Kimmel said, “you will be awarded the Oscar for best actor and permitted to give a 19-minute-long speech.”After landmark wins for Chloé Zhao (""Nomadland"") and Jane Campion (""The Power of the Dog""), no women were nominated for best director. Sarah Polley, though, won best adapted screenplay for the metaphor-rich Mennonite drama “Women Talking.”""Thank you to the academy for not being mortally offended by the words ‘women' and ‘talking,’"" said Polley.Daniel Roher's “Navalny,” about the imprisoned Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, took best documentary. The film’s win came with clear overtones to Navalny’s ongoing imprisonment and Vladimir Putin’s continued war in Ukraine. Yulia Navalnaya joined the filmmakers on the stage.“My husband is in prison just for telling the truth,” said Navalnaya. “Stay strong, my love.”Some big names weren’t in attendance for other reasons. Neither Tom Cruise, whose “Top Gun: Maverick” was up for best picture, nor James Cameron, director of best-picture nominee “Avatar: The Way of Water,” were at the ceremony. Both have been forefront in Hollywood’s efforts to get moviegoers back after years of pandemic.“The two guys who asked us to go back to theater aren’t in the theater,” said Kimmel, who added that Cruise without his shirt on in “Top Gun: Maverick” was “L. Ron Hubba Hubba.”Blockbuster nominees typically help boost Oscar ratings. Neither “Maverick” or “Avatar” — with some $3.7 billion in combined box office — took home much, though. “The Way of Water” won for visual effects; “Maverick” took best sound.After last year's Oscars, which had stripped some categories from being handed out in the live telecast, the academy restored all awards to the show and leaned on traditional song and and dance numbers. That meant some show-stopping numbers, including the elastic suspenders dance of “Naatu Naatu” from the Telugu action-film sensation “RRR,"" an intimate, impassioned performance by Lady Gaga of “Hold My Hand” from “Top Gun: Maverick,"" and an Super Bowl follow-up by Rihanna. Best song went to “Naatu Naatu "" from “RRR.”It also meant a long show. “This kind of makes you miss the slapping a little bit, right?” Kimmel said midway.After last year's slap, the academy created a crisis management team to better respond to surprises. Neither Rock, who recently made his most forceful statement about the incident in a live special, nor Smith, who was banned by the academy for 10 years, attended.Last year, Apple TV’s “CODA” became the first streaming movie to win best picture. But this year, nine of the 10 best picture nominees were theatrical releases. After the movie business cratered during the pandemic, moviegoing recovered to about 67% of pre-pandemic levels.

The Kings moved 3 1/2 games ahead of the Suns for the No. 3 seed in the Western Conference playoff race.The Kings finished the game on a 13-4 run. Seven Sacramento players scored at least 12 points. Domantas Sabonis had 17 points and a team-high eight rebounds.Sacramento's bench combined for 65 points on 20-for-33 shooting.“A lot of guys were able to contribute tonight,” Kings center Chimezie Metu said. “We've got a lot of good players on the bench. We have been consistent since I have been here with our starting lineup and guys just know what their rolls are and are ready to go in and impact the game, whether it is on the defensive end or going out there like Malik (Monk) did tonight.”The Suns were playing their second straight game without recently acquired star Kevin Durant, who hurt his ankle during pregame warmups before Wednesday's game.

Deandre Ayton had 22 points and 12 rebounds, and Chris Paul added 16 points and 16 assists.“We had so many ‘My bads’ and blown coverages, it just stacked against us,” Suns coach Monty Williams said. “You couple that with them having 36 free throws, then they made some 3s. It was too many holes for us to dig out of tonight.”Sacramento took a 67-59 lead into halftime. Trey Lyles led the Kings with 11 points, while Booker led the Suns with 17.

Williams was not pleased with the way his bench played, particularly since the Kings' bench was so productive.“Our bench came in tonight and the game plan was not there, from the jump,” Williams said. “We were fouling, Lyles came in and hit 3s.

Syria's air defenses shot several of them down.No deaths were reported. Photos from SANA show that the missiles may have landed on farmland.There was no immediate comment from Israel, which has staged hundreds of strikes on targets in Syria over the years. However, it rarely acknowledges or discusses such operations. It says it targets bases of Iran-allied militias, notably Lebanon’s militant Hezbollah group. Hezbollah has fighters deployed in Syria and fighting on the side of Syrian President Bashar Assad’s government forces. Israel also says it targets arms shipments believed to be bound for the militias.Israel previously attacked Masyaf in May and August 2022 killing five people and wounding two. According to the Britain-based opposition war monitor Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, the attacks targeted weapons depots belonging to Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard and Iran-backed militias.",2023/03/13,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833185,St. Louis wins 3rd straight with 2-1 victory over Portland,"PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — Kyle Hiebert scored the go-ahead goal in the 75th minute and St. Louis City won its third straight match with a 2-1 victory over the Portland Timbers on Saturday night, tying the MLS record for wins to start the season by an expansion team.Jared Stroud also scored for St. Louis, which was among just four teams in MLS with two wins to start the season heading into the match.“To be honest, it’s been a surreal couple of weeks, we're just having a blast,” Hiebert said. “This team is special. The locker room is special. To be able to get three points on the road was big time.""The Timbers took an early lead on Zac McGraw's header off a corner from Eryk Williamson in the third minute. Portland has scored in a team-record 23 consecutive matches, the longest active streak in the league.But Portland was hurt in the ninth minute when Cristhian Paredes had to be stretchered off with a hamstring injury. He was replaced by Evander, who Portland signed in the offseason.City regrouped and dominated the rest of the opening half, tying it up with Stroud's goal in first-half stoppage time. Heibert scored the winner on a header in the 75th that got past Timbers goalkeeper David Bingham.“We knew this wasn’t just going to be a soccer game, it was going to be a battle,” Portland coach Giovanni Savarese said.St. Louis was the first MLS team to score at least three goals in each of its first two matches, defeating Austin 3-2 in the opener and Charlotte 3-1 last weekend. In all three games this season, City has come from behind to win.“We just have confidence in the group and a calmness in the group. We’ve overcome a lot of adversity over the last couple of weeks, going down goals and showing great team resolve a great spirit and to come back every time,” City coach Bradley Carnell said.With its three wins to start the season, St. Louis matched the expansion Seattle Sounders' start in 2009.The Timbers opened the season with a 1-0 victory at home over Sporting Kansas City, before a 3-2 loss to LAFC last weekend.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/13,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833189,Defending champion leaves Iditarod race over health concerns,"ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — Brent Sass, the defending Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race champion, withdrew from this year’s race on Saturday, citing concerns for his health.Sass scratched at the Eagle Island checkpoint, a statement from the Iditarod said. Eagle Island is about 600 miles (966 kilometers) into the nearly 1,000-mile (1,609-kilometer) race.“He didn’t feel he could care for his team due to current concerns with his periodontal health,” the statement said. The condition typically relates to gum disease.A plane was being sent to Eagle Island to fly Sass off the trail, according to a video posted on the Iditarod Insider web page.“Yeah, I’m pretty sad, but it is what it is,” Sass’ father, Mark Sass, told Alaska Public Media. “I just want him to be OK.”The Iditarod said all 11 dogs on Sass’ team were in good health.Sass was in the lead when he arrived at the Eagle Island checkpoint late Friday night with an almost four-hour advantage over his nearest competitor, Jessie Holmes of Brushkana.Holmes was the first musher to leave the Eagle Island checkpoint early Saturday morning. The 40-year-old Alabama native in 2004 moved to Alaska, where he is a carpenter and appears on the National Geographic reality TV show “Life Below Zero,” about people who live in rural Alaska.The race started for 33 mushers on March 5 in Willow. It takes the sled dog teams over two mountain ranges, the frozen Yukon River and the treacherous Bering Sea ice en route to the finish line in Nome. Mushers had to contend with another issue during the first week of competition: Altering their race strategy because of high heat in interior Alaska.The winner is expected to mush down Nome’s Front Street, a block off the Bering Sea, to the finish line either Tuesday or Wednesday.Before the competitive start to the race, mushers greeted fans March 4 during a ceremonial start in downtown Anchorage and drove auction winners riding in their sleds for an 11-mile jaunt through the streets of the state's largest city.The 33 mushers represented the smallest field ever to start a race, one short of the first race run in 1973.Since then, three mushers including Sass have withdrawn.",2023/03/13,,World

Jake Oettinger had 28 saves.“It just shows the resiliency of our group,” Marchment said. “I don’t think there was a doubt we were going to come back and win that one. We played a great game, great road game and that was a huge win.”Oliver Bjorkstrand, Jordan Eberle and Ryan Donato scored, and Vince Dunn had two assists for the Kraken, who lost two in a row. Phillip Grubauer stopped 22 shots.The Kraken controlled the puck for almost the entire overtime, but after the Stars won a faceoff Heiskanen took a pass from Max Domi and fired in the winner.""That was a great pass by Maxi,” Heiskanen said. “It’s been a while since our last overtime win, so it’s great, of course. And it was a huge comeback win for us.”The last time Dallas had an overtime goal was on Dec. 12 against Detroit, although the Stars have had three shootout wins since then.“I think we did all the right things and sometimes it’s just not going to go your way,” Donato said. “They have a lot of good guys that can capitalize on a split-second opportunity. We had a lot of good chances at the end, but it is what it is.""After a scoreless first period, the Stars broke at 4:51 of the second with Hintz’s 32nd goal of the season. The score was set up by a rebound off Grubauer toward the left circle, and Esa Lindell fired a cross-ice pass to Hintz in the right circle, leaving an open net as Grubauer couldn’t dive back across the crease in time.The Kraken evened the score less than three minutes later, as Dunn fired a shot from near the blue line that was deflected by Matty Beniers and Eberle in front of the net. Beniers was initially given credit for the score, but it was later changed to Eberle. It was Eberle's 15th.Dallas regained the lead about midway through the second period. After the Stars won a faceoff in their offensive zone, Marchment deflected Ryan Suter’s shot past Grubauer for his 12th.Donato tied the game again at 2-2 midway through the third period with his 13th goal.The Kraken took the lead when Bjorkstrand scored a power-play goal with 3:25 left, but Pavelski tied it 3-3 with just over a minute left as he took advantage after Grubauer lost his stick in a flurry of activity in front of the net.Dallas coach Pete DeBoer said his team didn’t show any concern after Bjorkstrand’s goal.“Honestly, I think we felt pretty confident. I think we’d played a real good game to that point,” DeBoer said. “The guys felt confident we’d get the goalie out and score a goal.”NOTESSeattle's Jamie Oleksiak appeared in his 500th career game.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833192,NZ to chase 257 on final day of 1st test vs. Sri Lanka,"CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand (AP) — Ageless Angelo Mathews ground out a determined century to steady Sri Lanka, then put it back into a competitive position in a closely-fought match Sunday on the fourth day of the first test against New Zealand.At 35 and in his 101st test, Mathews produced his 14th century and one of his best. He was at the crease when play began, 20 not out overnight, and was finally out after tea for 115 with Sri Lanka 242 runs in front after trailing by 18 on the first innings.Sri Lanka eventually was all out for 302, a lead of 284. At stumps, after 17 overs, New Zealand was 28-1, still 256 behind, and the test is set for a thrilling final day. If New Zealand reaches its target, it will be its third-highest successful run chase in tests.If Sri Lanka wins, it will be only for the third time in New Zealand and it will keep alive its chances of reaching the final of the World Test Championship.Sri Lanka improved its chances of winning the match and leading the two-match series when it dismissed Devon Conway for 1 in the fifth over. Conway played defensively but with an unusally full follow-through at a ball from Kasun Rajitha which held up at little. The ball flew back to the bowler who took a two-handed catch above his head.On a day of undulating fortunes when both teams at times felt in charge, Mathews was the most influential figure.Sri Lanka began the day at 83-3, effectively 65-3 because of New Zealand’s narrow first innings lead. The wicket of nightwatchman Prabath Jayusuriya was the only one to fall in a slow morning session after which Mathews was 54 and Sri Lanka was 150-4, leading by 132.At that point the game was finely balanced. If the New Zealand could make further inroads into the Sri Lanka innings, especially with the second new ball, the match might have tipped entirely in favor of the home team.But Mathews became the face of Sri Lanka’s resistance, batting on through the first two sessions, even when the ball was bouncing and moving. He picked his shots carefully to minimize risk and built his century in just under 5-1/2 hours from 235 balls with 11 fours.Mathews had support throughout the day from Dinesh Chandimal who made 42 in a 105-run partnership for the fifth wicket and Dhananjaya de Silva who made an unbeaten 47 batting at No. 7.New Zealand was a bowler short throughout the fourth day because Neil Wagner has back and hamstring injuries and couldn’t bowl. The bowlers had to work hard but were rewarded by pace and bounce on a Hagley Oval pitch which will still be competitive for batters and bowlers on the last day.Blair Tickner took four wickets, Matt Henry three and Tim Southee two as the New Zealand seamers worked hard to make up for Wagner’s absence. Daryl Mitchell also bowled 12 overs to play his part.“I’m a bit sore and tired. We worked hard to bowl them out and we’re going to push for the win tomorrow,” Tickner said. “It was an overall great performance by the bowling team.”___More AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/13,,World

The eighth-ranked Wildcats hung on from there, beating No. 2 UCLA 61-59 in the Pac-12 championship game.“I kept telling myself, the next shot is going in,"" Ramey said. “My job was to make a play.”The Wildcats (28-6) boosted their case for a No. 2 seed in the NCAA Tournament. UCLA (29-5) still hopes to land the No. 1 seed in the West and return to Las Vegas in two weeks for the regional.It was the second year in a row Arizona beat UCLA in the Pac-12 title game.Arizona second-year coach Tommy Lloyd can't lose in Las Vegas. He is 9-0 in this city, 8-0 at T-Mobile Arena and 6-0 in the Pac-12 Tournament.“It was a knock down, drag out and I had a feeling it was going to be that way,” Lloyd said. “So much respect for the UCLA program. Obviously, they're going through a lot of injury stuff right now, but they're resilient and I knew it was going to be like that.”Ramey's 3-pointer put the Wildcats ahead 60-58. The clutch shot came after teammate Azuolas Tubelis missed a 3 that was rebounded by Pelle Larsson, who got the ball to Ramey.UCLA guard Tyger Campbell was fouled with 6.8 seconds left, and he made the first free throw but missed the second. Tubelis hit one of two free throws with 5.8 seconds to go, and UCLA's Dylan Andrews missed a 3 at the buzzer to ensure Arizona's victory.“Wide-open shot to win the game,” UCLA coach Mick Cronin said. “Tyger’s beating himself up over a missed free throw, but that had nothing to do with some of our bad fouls and defensive breakdowns. Those are controllables. I’ll take Tyger at the line and put my career on the line with Tyger at the line.”Tubelis, the tournament's Most Outstanding Player, had 19 points and 14 rebounds for second-seeded Arizona. Oumar Ballo scored 13 points and Larsson had 11.Amari Bailey led top-seeded UCLA with 19 points. Campbell scored 16 and Jaime Jaquez Jr. had 13 points and 10 rebounds.The Bruins knew coming in they wouldn't have guard Jaylen Clark (lower leg) or Adem Bona (shoulder), and their problems only mounted when two of Bona's replacements in the post got into foul trouble.Mac Etienne and Kenneth Nwuba each had four fouls in the second half, forcing Cronin to play at least one of them. Etienne fouled out with 9:35 left and Nwuba with 4:27 remaining, meaning the Bruins had to play with a smaller lineup the rest of the game.Arizona wasn't completely healthy, either. Point guard Kerr Kriisa has been playing with a balky shoulder this tournament.POSTGAME COMMOTIONAn Arizona fan was yelling at Cronin's dad, Hep, after the game, according to UCLA radio broadcaster Josh Lewin. When a reporter told Cronin afterward, he immediately left the postgame news conference. Athletic director Martin Jarmond quickly followed him.BIG PICTUREArizona: The Wildcats entered the game just 10 3-pointers behind their school record set in the 2010-11 season. But long-range shots didn't fall for them against the Bruins until the end. Arizona went 6 of 20 from beyond the arc.UCLA: The question is the health of Clark and Bona. Cronin won't provide any information other than saying before the Pac-12 Tournament that Clark wouldn't play. UCLA was easily the class of the Pac-12 this season, but not having those players was quite noticeable, especially against Arizona.UP NEXTArizona: Likely will be a No. 2 seed in the NCAA Tournament.UCLA: Almost certainly a No. 1 or No. 2 seed in the NCAA tourney.___AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/college-basketball and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/13,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833194,"Matt Duchene scores shootout winner, Predators top Kings 2-1","LOS ANGELES (AP) — Matt Duchene scored in the second round of the shootout and the Nashville Predators snapped the Los Angeles Kings' five-game winning streak with a 2-1 victory Saturday night.Duchene, who scored his 27th shootout goal in 71 chances, put a shot between Pheonix Copley's legs for the only score in the tiebreaker.“I was mad at myself in Vancouver for missing there. The boys count on me in that situation. You have to take advantage of it,” said Duchene, who is 4 of 6 in shootouts this season. “We deserved to win tonight. I thought we played a real stingy, smart game.”Tommy Novak scored for the Predators and Kevin Lankinen made 26 saves. Nashville has earned points in four of the five games on its road trip and are six points behind Winnipeg for the final wild card spot in the Western Conference. The Predators though have have three games in hand on the Jets.“I thought in general it was a good hockey game,"" Nashville coach John Hynes said. ""They had some good looks and our goaltender made some big saves. I thought we had some good looks at times and their guy made some good saves. I'm glad we were able to find a way to come out on top.”Mikey Anderson had the Kings’ goal. and Copley stopped 30 shots. Despite the loss, Los Angeles has picked up a point in six straight games and is one point behind Vegas in the Pacific Division.“At the end of the night, we lost the special-team battle — penalty kill, power play and the shootout. So we’re fortunate to get a point,” Kings coach Todd McLellan said.Nashville improved to 4-2 in shootouts while Los Angeles lost for only the second time in eight shootouts.Anderson opened the scoring at 9:32 of the first period when he took the pass from Gabriel Vilardi in the slot and beat Lankinen on his glove side with a snap shot. It was the defenseman's fourth goal of the season and second in the past three games.Nashville evened it on the power play with 55.2 seconds remaining in the first when Novak scored from high in the slot while Copley was being screened. The goal made Novak the sixth Nashville player with 10 or more goals this season.It also was the Predators' 10th power-play goal since Feb. 18, which is third in the league.“It was a good draw win (off the faceoff) and I kind of felt like my only option was to throw it on net. Good screen by Cody (Glass) and luckily it went in,” Novak said.Nashville's Philip Tomasino had the best opportunity in overtime but whiffed on the shot in front of the net.FIRST GAMENashville's Egor Afanasyev made his NHL debut after being called up from Milwaukee of the AHL on Friday. Afanasyev was a second-round pick by Nashville in 2019 and is the fourth rookie to make his debut for the Predators this season.SLUMPINGLos Angeles has the league's fifth-best power play with a 23.9% conversion rate, but it has struggled recently. The Kings were 0 for 3 on Saturday and are 3 for 31 over the past 10 games.TRAINER'S ROOMKings forward Kevin Fiala missed the game due to a lower-body injury. Fiala, who leads Los Angeles with 68 points, left Thursday's game at Colorado after a knee-on-knee hit from Andrew Cogliano.UP NEXTPredators: At Anaheim on Sunday night.Kings: Host the New York Islanders on Tuesday night.___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/13,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833199,"Colorado GOP selects combative, election-denying new leader","LOVELAND, Colo. (AP) — The Colorado Republican Party on Saturday selected a combative former state representative who promised to be a “wartime” leader as its new chairman, joining several other state GOPs this year that have elected far-right figures and election conspiracy theorists to their top posts.The move in Colorado comes as the party totters on the brink of political irrelevance in a state moving swiftly to the left.Former State Rep. Dave Williams, who unsuccessfully tried to insert the phrase “Let's Go Brandon” into his name on the party's primary ballot last year and insists — incorrectly — that former President Donald Trump won the 2020 election, was selected by the party's executive committee out of a seven-person field.Williams crossed the required 50% threshold on the third ballot after being endorsed by one of his competitors, indicted former Mesa County Clerk Tina Peters, who had failed to surpass 10%. Peters faces seven felony charges for her alleged role in illegally accessing voting machines in her county. She has denied the allegations while becoming a prominent national figure in the election conspiracy movement.A three-term state representative from a conservative district in the city of Colorado Springs, Williams unsuccessfully challenged Rep. Doug Lamborn in the Republican primary last year. The Colorado Secretary of State's office rejected his effort to include a popular conservative phrase denigrating President Joe Biden in his name on the ballot. A judge agreed Williams could not be known as Dave “Let's Go Brandon” Williams.In his speech to nearly 400 hardcore Republican activists and party leaders, Williams reprised the themes he hit during his campaign — that the party's recent poor performance in Colorado is simply due to it not fighting hard enough, not any disconnect between its activists and the majority of the state's voters.“Our party doesn't have a brand problem,” Williams told the group. “Our party has a problem with feckless leaders. ... We need a wartime leader.""Election deniers have won three other state party chair positions recently — in Idaho, Kansas and Michigan — and as his party is reeling from a brutal 2022 election year.Republicans lost every statewide election last year by double digits and are down to their lowest share of the state Legislature in Colorado history. They have not won a major statewide race since 2014 and lag well behind Democrats and unaffiliated voters in registration.Like six of the seven candidates who ran, Williams advocated trying to overturn a ballot measure that requires the party to allow unaffiliated voters to cast ballots in its primary. All of the candidates except Kevin McCarney, a former Mesa County party chairman, expressed skepticism that Biden legitimately won the 2020 election.Williams' main rival ended up being Erik Aadland, a combat veteran and political novice who ran an unsuccessful race for a congressional swing seat in the Denver suburbs last year. Although he's also questioned the 2020 election results, he advocated for discussing elections in less aggressive language and based his speech Saturday around the theme of how “love trumps hate.”Still, he also spoke in combative terms about how the party should move forward after Williams' selection.“We are besought by a radical left that wants to destroy this country, and we need to come together and win elections,” Aadland told the crowd.",2023/03/13,,World

(AP) — Marcus Johansson, Mats Zuccarello and Matt Boldy scored in Minnesota's three-goal third period, and the Wild beat the San Jose Sharks 5-2 Saturday night.Jared Spurgeon and Frederick Gaudreau also scored, and Ryan Hartman and John Klingberg each had two assists to help the Wild extend their point streak to 12 games (10-0-2) — one shy of the franchise record — with their their fourth straight road win. Marc-Andre Fleury made 35 saves to improve to 18-5-4 against the Sharks.“I don’t think we’re getting complacent,” Spurgeon said of the streak. “After a game is done, we sort of push it aside and look forward to the next one. Everyone is contributing, whether it’s blocking shots or, you see the power play step up today to make some big plays for us.”The Wild remained two points behind first-place Dallas in the Central Division after the Stars won earlier Saturday night at Seattle.Logan Couture and Tomas Hertl each had a goal and an assist for San Jose, and Erik Karlsson added an assist for his 84th point of the year to set a franchise record for points by a defenseman. James Reimer had 24 saves.The Sharks have lost six straight home games and eight of their last nine overall.“We played a good hockey game,” San Jose coach David Quinn said. “We were sniping from an offensive perspective. We had plenty of scoring chances. Fleury played great. And we’ve just been finding ways to lose.”Spurgeon opened the scoring just 1:44 into the game, beating Reimer on a partial breakaway for his 10th goal of the season.Minnesota led 1-0 after the first period, despite being outshot 18-5.“They obviously came out with a lot of jump,” Wild coach Dean Evason said. “We didn’t handle it real well at the start. Obviously, Flower kept us in the hockey game, made some incredible saves to allow us to get our legs under us, and maybe more so our minds straight. When we started playing the way we’re supposed to play and know we can play, we got better and better.”Couture tied the score on the power play in the second period, scoring his team-leading 23rd.Gaudreau put the Wild back in front with a power-play goal of his own late in the period. Reimer stopped an initial shot by Johansson, but Gaudreau put home the rebound for his 13th.Johansson extended the lead 30 seconds into the third period, redirecting Klingberg’s shot into the net for his 14th.Hertl brought San Jose back within 1 on the power play with 11:24 remaining, scoring his 19th of the season and 200th of his career. Minnesota challenged the play for goaltender interference but the call was confirmed upon video review.Less than three minutes later, Zuccarello pushed the lead back to 2 with a power-play goal, his 21st of the year.“I thought the last five (minutes) of the second and then the third we played a lot better, got back to just being stingy,” Spurgeon noted.Boldy added an empty-netter for his 18th.2,000 GAMESDuring the first period, the Sharks recognized assistant equipment manager Vinny Ferraiuolo, who worked his 2,000th NHL game.NOTES: Klingberg reached 400 points for his career. ...

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833201,Defiant Kohli propels India to lead in 4th test vs Australia,"AHMEDABAD, India (AP) — Virat Kohli reached triple figures for the first time in 41 innings and a wait of more than three years to nudge India ahad of Australia on day four of the fourth test Sunday.Kohli scored 186 runs, his 28th test hundred and his highest test score against Australia, as India finished with 571 (178.5 overs) runs in its first innings to take a lead of 91 runs over Australia’s first-innings total of 480 runs.At stumps, Matthew Kuhnemann and Travis Head (3 not out) negotiated six overs with Australia at 3-0 in its second innings, trailing by 88 runs.First innings centurion Usman Khawaja did not open the innings after suffering a suspected knee injury while fielding with Kuhnemann a surprising choice to replace him. The night-watchman survived as Srikar Bharat missed a sharp catching chance in the penultimate over.Kohli’s last test hundred came against Bangladesh in November 2019.Post lunch, Kohli got to his 75th international hundred off 241 balls, including five fours. He had faced 162 deliveries without hitting a boundary, and after reaching his milestone, started playing more attacking strokes. Overall, he hit 15 fours.It was Kohli’s 16th international hundred against Australia, and second slowest test hundred in terms of balls faced.Srikar Bharat meanwhile scored 44 runs off 88 balls, including two fours and three sixes. He added 84 runs for the fifth wicket with Kohli, before falling to Nathan Lyon.There was no respite for Australia though as India’s highest scorer in this series, Axar Patel, stitched up another long partnership with Kohli.India went to tea at 472-5, with Kohli-Patel adding 162 runs for the sixth wicket. The duo batted for 37.1 overs while chasing down the Australian lead.The hosts were ahead by 75 runs by the time Patel got out after scoring 79 off 113 balls.Kohli also picked up the slack and reached 150 off 313 balls, adding seven more fours since reaching his century.Mitchell Starc (1-97) finally bowled Patel in the 173rd over, and the Indian lower order suffered a mini collapse thereafter.Ravichandran Ashwin (7) holed out to midwicket off Lyon, while Umesh Yadav was run out without troubling the scorers.Kohli was last man out, caught in the deep off Todd Murphy (3-113) with Shreyas Iyer failing to come out to bat owing to a lower-back issue. He reportedly went to a local hospital for scans and is being monitored by the Indian medical team.Lyon finished with 3-151 from 65 overs, the most he has ever bowled for Australia in a single test innings. ___More AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/13,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833202,Israeli forces kill 3 Palestinian militants in West Bank,"JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli forces shot and killed three Palestinian militants Sunday who opened fire on troops in the occupied West Bank, the military said, the latest bloodshed in a year-long wave of violence in the region.The Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, an armed offshoot of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah party, claimed the men killed as members.The Palestinian Health Ministry said the men were killed by Israeli fire near the city of Nablus and identified them as Jihad Mohammed al-Shami, 24, Uday Othman al-Shami, 22 and Mohammed Raed Dabeek, 18.The military said it confiscated three M16 rifles from the militants after the shootout and that one gunman turned himself in and was arrested.The deaths Sunday bring to 80 the number of Palestinians killed since the start of the year, as Israel has stepped up arrest raids in the West Bank. A spasm of Palestinian attacks against Israelis has killed 14 people in 2023.The fresh violence follows an Israeli military raid last week on the West Bank village of Jaba, where three Palestinian militants were killed. Hours later, a Palestinian gunman opened fire on a busy Tel Aviv thoroughfare at the start of the Israeli weekend, wounding three people before being shot and killed.The current round of violence is one of the worst between Israelis and Palestinians in the West Bank in years. It began last spring after a series of Palestinian attacks against Israelis that triggered near-nightly Israeli raids in the West Bank.Nearly 150 Palestinians were killed in the West Bank and east Jerusalem in 2022, making it the deadliest year in those areas since 2004, according to the leading Israeli rights group B'Tselem. Palestinian attacks against Israelis during that same time killed 30 people.The military says most of the Palestinians killed were militants. But stone-throwing youths protesting the incursions and others not involved in confrontations have also been killed.Israel says the raids are essential to dismantle militant networks and prevent future attacks. But attacks appear to be intensifying rather than slowing down.The Palestinians view the raids as a tightening by Israel of its 55-year, open-ended occupation of lands they seek for their future state.Israel captured the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians seek those territories for their future independent state.",2023/03/13,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833203,Oil giant Saudi Aramco reports profits in 2022 of $161B off higher crude oil prices,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Oil giant Saudi Aramco reports profits in 2022 of $161B off higher crude oil prices.",2023/03/13,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833204,Oil giant Saudi Aramco makes a historic $161B profit in 2022,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Oil giant Saudi Aramco reported Sunday earning $161 billion last year, claiming the highest-ever recorded annual profit by a publicly listed company and drawing immediate criticism from activists.The monster profit by the firm, known formally as the Saudi Arabian Oil Co., came off the back of energy prices rising after Russia launched its war on Ukraine in February 2022, with sanctions limiting the sale of Moscow's oil and natural gas in Western markets.Aramco also hopes to increase its production to take advantage of market demand as China reenters the global market after lifting its coronavirus restrictions. That could raise the billions needed to pay for Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's plans to develop futuristic cityscapes to pivot Saudi Arabia away from oil.However, those plans come despite growing international concerns over the burning of fossil fuels accelerating climate change. Meanwhile, higher energy prices already have strained relations between Riyadh and Washington, as well as driven up inflation worldwide.“Given that we anticipate oil and gas will remain essential for the foreseeable future, the risks of underinvestment in our industry are real — including contributing to higher energy prices,"" Saudi Aramco CEO and President Amin H. Nasser said in a statement.Profits rose 46.5% when compared to the company's 2021 results of $110 billion. It earned $49 billion in 2020 when the world faced the worst of the coronavirus pandemic lockdown, travel disruptions and oil prices briefly going negative.Aramco put its crude production at around 11.5 million barrels a day in 2022 and said it hoped to reach 13 million barrels a day by 2027.To boost that production, it plans to spend as much as $55 billion this year on capital projects.Aramco also declared a dividend of $19.5 billion for the fourth quarter of 2022, to be paid in the first quarter of this year.Aramco's results, viewed as a bellwether for the global energy market, mirror the huge profits seen at those of U.K. energy giant BP,America's Exxon Mobil, Shell and others in 2022. But the sheer size of the $161 billion profit overshadowed even its own previous results, as well as records by Apple, Vodafone and the U.S. Federal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae.Benchmark Brent crude oil now trades around $82 a barrel, though prices had reached over $120 a barrel back in June. Aramco, whose fortunes hinge on global energy prices, announced a record $42.4 billion profit in the third quarter of 2022 off the back of that price spike.Those high prices have further strained ties between the kingdom and the United States, traditionally a security guarantor among the Gulf Arab states amid tensions with Iran. Before the midterm elections in November, the kingdom said the Biden administration sought to delay a decision by OPEC and allies including Russia to cut production that could have kept gasoline prices lower for voters — making public the typically behind-the-scenes negotiations common in the region.President Joe Biden had warned the kingdom that “there’s going to be some consequences for what they’ve done” in terms of oil prices. However, those consequences have yet to be seen as Saudi Arabia and Iran went to China to strike a diplomatic deal Friday. U.S. gasoline prices now stand on average at $3.47 a gallon, down just about a dollar from last year.For the kingdom, higher crude oil prices can help fuel the dreams of Prince Mohammed, including his planned $500 billion futuristic desert city project called Neom. However, they also run against the fears of activists over climate change, particularly as the United Nations' COP28 climate talks will begin this November in the neighboring United Arab Emirates.Saudi Arabia has pledged to have net-zero carbon emissions by 2060, like China and Russia, though its plans to reach that goal remain unclear. Aramco's earnings report noted it started a $1.5 billion Sustainability Fund in October and plans a carbon-capture-and-storage facility as well.Amnesty International's secretary-general, Agnès Callamard, criticized Aramco's annual profit coming amid global concerns about climate change.“It is shocking for a company to make a profit of more than $161 billion in a single year through the sale of fossil fuel — the single largest driver of the climate crisis,"" she said in a statement. ""It is all the more shocking because this surplus was amassed during a global cost-of-living crisis and aided by the increase in energy prices resulting from Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine.”Callamard also noted that Saudi Arabia remains one of the world's top executioners while also remaining locked in a yearslong war in Yemen and cracking down on dissent.""These extraordinary profits, and any future income derived from Aramco, should not be deployed to finance human rights abuses, cover them up, or try and gloss over them,” she said.Saudi Arabia’s vast oil resources, located close to the surface of its desert expanse, make it one of the world’s least expensive places to produce crude. For every $10 rise in the price of a barrel of oil, Saudi Arabia stands to make an additional $40 billion a year, according to the Institute of International Finance.Shares in Aramco stood at $8.74 on Riyadh's Tadawul stock exchange before it opened Sunday. That's down from a high of $11.55 a share in the last year. However, that current price still gives Aramco a valuation of $1.9 trillion — making it the world's second most valuable company behind only Apple.The Saudi government still owns the vast majority of the firm's shares. Saudi Aramco publicly listed a sliver of its worth back in late 2019.Aramco will release a comprehensive earnings report Monday.___Follow Jon Gambrell on Twitter at www.twitter.com/jongambrellAP.",2023/03/13,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833232,Hollywood stars spend Oscars eve at annual Chanel dinner,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — The night before the Oscars many of Hollywood’s biggest stars were not early to bed before the show. They were instead chatting the night away, martinis and champagne in hand, at the storied Polo Lounge in The Beverly Hills Hotel for the annual Chanel and Charles Finch dinner, an invite that's even harder to get than a seat at the Academy Awards.The patio where the likes of Clark Gable and Darryl Zanuck once dined was filled with the industry’s brightest talents, many of whom were dressed head to toe in Chanel, including Kristen Stewart, Marion Cotillard, Nicole Kidman and Camila Morrone.On the red carpet, Kidman and Stewart ran to one another to catch up, hugging and posing for photographers.“It's been so long,” Kidman said.Cotillard would join in moments later. Later on the patio, Kidman, emerging from a conversation with Idris Elba, could be seen embracing Ariana DeBose as Tessa Thompson spoke with best actress nominee Andrea Riseborough.“I’m sure you must be tired,” Thompson said.Elsewhere there was a meeting of Spider-Mans as Andrew Garfield approached Tobey Maguire, who was sipping one of the spot’s iconic martinis.“You! You!” Maguire said, as Garfield went in for a hug. They then turned to speak to “The Whale” director Darren Aronofsky.Several feet behind them, Jonathan Majors was deep in conversation with Riz Ahmed, while best supporting actress nominee Kerry Condon tried and failed to get a drink from the bar that had closed down in an attempt to coax the chatty celebrities into the dining room.Inside, they were treated to a surprise performance by “The White Lotus” actor Beatrice Grannò.Other attendees included Michael B. Jordan, Danielle Deadwyler, Hugh Grant, Brie Larson, Sigourney Weaver, Vicky Krieps, Minnie Driver, Patty Jenkins, Sarah Polley, Lily James, David O. Russell, Jerry Bruckheimer, Sofia Boutella and Ted Sarandos.Morrone, star of “Daisy Jones & The Six,” has been going to the event for several years and said it’s one of her favorites.“It’s like a really glamorous sleepover,” Morrone said. “I just love it here. I love to see all of the people who work in the entertainment industry who are being honored tomorrow. You’re in a room with like really artistic and incredible humans, so you just soak it all in. And I’ve won some pretty incredible Chanel pieces over the past few years here.”For actor Whitney Peak, who is the new new face of Chanel’s Coco Mademoiselle fragrance, the event was a chance to speak to some of her favorite filmmakers.“There’s been such great movies this year and so many people who are responsible for making those films are in the room today,” Peak said. “Daniel Kwan is going to be here and I’m like, how do I tell him that I’ve been a fan of him since the Lil Jon music video?”Chanel and cinema have been intertwined since the fashion house’s earliest days. In 1930, Samuel Goldwyn invited Gabrielle Chanel to Hollywood to dress film stars including Gloria Swanson. On her arrival back in Paris, Chanel collaborated with French filmmakers like Jean Renoir and dressed many of the new wave actresses such as Jeanne Moreau and Romy Schneider.More recently, Chanel has supported independent productions including Leos Carax’s “Annette” and Mia Hansen-Løve’s “Bergman Island.” Chanel provided the funding for Olivier Assayas’s 35mm camera for “The Clouds of Sils Maria” and has for more than a decade supported programs for emerging filmmakers and cinematic preservation and restorations.Not every attendee planned to make the trek down the champagne carpet at the Oscars Sunday, but one person who will certainly be there is filmmaker Ava DuVernay, who is on the Academy’s Board of Governors.“I’m looking forward to seeing a calm, normal Oscars,” DuVernay said. “I was there last year and it was a little traumatizing. I just want it to be chill and uneventful. That would be nice.”___For more on this year’s Oscars, visit: https://apnews.com/hub/academy-awards.",2023/03/13,,World

Athletic director Martin Jarmond quickly followed him.The Los Angeles Times reported that security asked fans in that area to leave and that Jarmond was in touch with conference officials about the situation.Alex Timiraos, UCLA associate athletic director for athletic communications, did not immediately respond to an AP request for comment.Hep Cronin, a successful high school coach, gained national attention during UCLA's unexpected run to the 2021 Final Four as he was reunited with his son at the NCAA Tournament following a yearlong physical separation due to the COVID-19 pandemic.___AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/college-basketball and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/13,,World

Argentine journalist Sergio Rubin, who recently co-wrote a book about Francis, agrees with other observers who say that the pope is keeping his home country at arm’s length to avoid being drawn into Argentina’s political polarization of the past two decades.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833236,"Swiss skier Odermatt leads GS, closes in on discipline title","KRANJSKA GORA, Slovenia (AP) — Olympic champion Marco Odermatt led a men's World Cup giant slalom Sunday to close in on his second straight season title in the discipline.Racing in sunny and warm conditions on the Podkoren 3 course, the Swiss skier was 0.28 seconds faster than Alexis Pinturault of France.Odermatt's only rival for the GS title, Henrik Kristoffersen, trailed by 0.47 in third.Odermatt leads the Norwegian by 140 points in the GS standings and would lock up the title if he remains at least 100 points ahead with only the season-ending race next Saturday remaining.“The pressure is not huge. I have a lot of confidence,” said Odermatt, who won a GS on the same hill Saturday and triumphed in five of the eight giant slaloms he started this season.Odermatt has already successfully defended his overall title this season, while also winning the super-G globe and world titles in GS and downhill.Norway's Lucas Braathen and Slovenia's Zan Kranjec in fourth and fifth, respectively, were the only other skiers to finish within a second of the lead.The second run was scheduled for later Sunday.___More AP skiing: https://apnews.com/hub/skiing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/13,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833237,"Russian advance stalls in Ukraine's Bakhmut, think tank says","KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia’s advance seems to have stalled in Moscow's campaign to capture the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, a leading think tank said in an assessment of the longest ground battle of the war.The Washington-based Institute for the Study of War said there were no confirmed advances by Russian forces in Bakhmut. Russian forces and units from the Kremlin-controlled paramilitary Wagner Group continued to launch ground attacks in the city, but there was no evidence that they were able to make any progress, ISW said late Saturday.The report cited the spokesperson of the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ Eastern Group, Serhii Cherevaty, who said that fighting in the Bakhmut area had been more intense this week than the previous one. According to Cherevaty, there were 23 clashes in the city over the previous 24 hours.The ISW’s report comes following claims of Russian progress earlier this week. The U.K. Defense Ministry said Saturday that paramilitary units from the Kremlin-controlled Wagner Group had seized most of eastern Bakhmut, with a river flowing through the city now marking the front line of the fighting. The assessment highlighted that Russia’s assault will be difficult to sustain without more significant personnel losses.The mining city of Bakhmut is located in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk province, one of four regions of Ukraine that Russian President Vladimir Putin illegally annexed last year. Russia’s military opened the campaign to take control of Bakhmut in August, and both sides have experienced staggering casualties. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has vowed not to retreat.In its latest report Sunday, the U.K. Defense Ministry said Sunday that the impact of the heavy casualties Russia is continuing to suffer in Ukraine varies dramatically across the country. The ministry's intelligence update said that the major cities of Moscow and St. Petersburg remain “relatively unscathed,” particularly among members of Russia's elite. In contrast, in many of Russia’s eastern regions, the death rate as a percentage of the population is “30-40 times higher than in Moscow.”The report highlighted that ethnic minorities often take the biggest hit. In the southern Astrakhan region, for example, about “75% of casualties come from the minority Kazakh and Tartar populations.”Russia’s mounting casualties are reflected in a loss of government control over the country’s information sphere, ISW said. The think tank said that Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova confirmed “infighting in the Kremlin inner circle” and that the Kremlin has effectively ceded control over the country’s information space, with Putin unable to readily regain control.The ISW sees Zakharova’s comments, made at a forum on the “practical and technological aspects of information and cognitive warfare in modern realities” in Moscow, as “noteworthy” and in line with the think tank’s long standing assessments about the “deteriorating Kremlin regime and information space control dynamics.”Elsewhere in Ukraine, Russian attacks over the previous day killed at least five people and wounded another seven across Ukraine’s Donetsk and Kherson regions, local Ukrainian authorities reported on Sunday morning.Donetsk Gov. Pavlo Kyrylenko said that two people were killed in the region, one in the city of Kostyantynivka and one in the village of Tonenke. Four further civilians were wounded.Local officials in the southern Kherson province confirmed that Russian forces fired 29 times on Ukrainian-controlled territory in the region on Saturday, with residential areas of the regional capital, Kherson, coming under fire three times. Three people died in the province and a further three were wounded.In Ukraine’s northeastern Kharkiv province, the Kharkiv, Chuhuiv and Kupiansk districts came under fire, but no civilian casualties were reported.The head of Ukraine’s southern Mykolaiv province Gov. Vitali Kim said Sunday morning that the town of Ochakiv, set at the mouth of the Dnieper River, came under artillery fire in the early hours of Sunday. Cars were set ablaze, while private houses and high-rise buildings sustained damage. No casualties were reported.___Follow the AP’s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",2023/03/13,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833238,2 foreign tourists die in Kenya nature reserve crash,"NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — Two foreign tourists, German and Swiss nationals, have died after the vehicle they were traveling in veered off the road and overturned in Kenya’s Maasai Mara national reserve, police said Sunday.The crash happened after the vehicle car got stuck in the mud and veered off the road on Saturday, police said.One other tourist was injured and two others, a German and a Swiss national, escaped unhurt. They were part of a tour group, but it wasn't immediately clear who was driving the vehicle.The injured tourist was airlifted to a hospital in Kenya’s capital, Nairobi, Maasai Mara Chief Warden Stephen ole Mining said.Police spokesperson Resila Onyango said the crash was under investigation.Maasai Mara national reserve is a popular tourist destination and features the annual wildebeest migration from the Serengeti in Tanzania.Climate change effects are being felt in the expansive wildlife reserve with little vegetation because of five failed consecutive rainy seasons with less than usual rainfall recorded over the last two years.",2023/03/13,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833239,‘Not done yet’: Skier Shiffrin continues quest for records,"Does getting a record 87th World Cup win make Mikaela Shiffrin the greatest ski racer of all time?Shiffrin doesn’t think so, despite congratulations pouring in from the likes of tennis stars Roger Federer and Iga Swiatek, actress Kate Winslet, and fellow skiing standouts Lindsey Vonn and Bode Miller.In fact, Shiffrin laughs off the G.O.A.T. talk.“Because all I can really see in my mind is an image of a baby goat, or like a fainting goat. That’s what comes in my head,” Shiffrin said after surpassing Swedish great Ingemar Stenmark as the winningest ski racer in the 56-year-history of Alpine skiing’s World Cup.“That image is sort of scarred into my mind and the first thing I think about when I hear people say ‘G.O.A.T.’, I just kind of laugh.”She adds that the ‘greatest’ label doesn’t belong to just one skier.“After all these years racing and getting to this point now, I realize no matter what I accomplish, people root for who they want to win – for whatever reason,” she said.“It could be something that doesn’t have anything to do with me, or doesn’t have anything to do with Ingemar, or Lindsey, or Marcel (Hirscher), or Bode, or whoever. It is a personal thing, and that’s what is so beautiful about sport.”Shiffrin won Saturday’s slalom in Are in Stenmark’s native Sweden to break the 34-year-old record, which is comparable with a tennis player earning a 25th major singles title to surpass Australian great Margaret Court, who for five decades has held the record of 24 titles.Another comparison underlines Shiffrin's dominance of her sport. In the time since her first victory on December 20, 2012, Shiffrin won more than twice as many World Cup races as the entire Austria women’s ski team, which has managed 43 victories.With Shiffrin turning 28 Monday, the American is bound to add to her tally of 87 and other milestones will come her way.“I think she can win more than 100,” Stenmark said in a recent interview with The Associated Press.“100 or more,” was also the prediction of Austrian former slalom specialist Marlies Raich, one of Shiffrin’s early idols.Best marks are also on the cards for Shiffrin when it comes to the number of crystal globes – the award for winning the season discipline or overall title.By winning the overall, slalom and GS titles this season, Shiffrin has extended her collection to 15 globes – five short of Vonn’s 20.Shiffrin, with seven slalom globes, is one short of Vonn and Stenmark, who each had eight titles in a single discipline — Vonn in downhill, Stenmark in both slalom and GS.Also, Shiffrin’s five overall titles rank her one behind the women’s record of six, set by Annemarie Moser-Proell in the 1970s.Across genders, Shiffrin still needs three more to match another Austrian standout, Marcel Hirscher, who racked up eight men’s overall titles in a row from 2012-19.Away from World Cup racing, two-time Olympic champion Shiffrin has nine gold medals and 17 in total from major championships. She won’t be able to add to those for nearly two more years, with the 2025 world championships in Saalbach, Austria, and the 2026 Milan-Cortina Olympics next up.Despite setting many of the sport’s records, Shiffrin said she still feels “that anticipation, that nervousness, that I want to race.”“For me that is a sign I have no lack of motivation,” she said. “It’s the skiing that I want to do. Every day I wake up and want to do it, again and again. That is not done yet, it’s stronger than ever.”___Eric Willemsen on Twitter: https://twitter.com/eWilmedia___More AP skiing: https://apnews.com/hub/skiing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/13,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833240,Napoli returns to Champions League set for historic season,"Napoli returns to Champions League action this week well on track to have the standout season in European soccer and in the club’s entire history.The quarterfinals of Europe's marquee club competition finally beckon for Napoli, which has a 2-0 lead from the first leg before hosting Eintracht Frankfurt in the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona on Wednesday.Only three of the 12 teams left in the competition top their domestic leagues — Napoli, Bayern Munich and Benfica — and the 18-point lead in Serie A is by far the most dominant.Real Madrid hosting Liverpool with a 5-2 lead is the glamor game of the four second legs remaining in the round of 16, though only Madrid of that storied pair has so much as a chance of a domestic league title.Napoli is a lock to be Italian champion for just the third time in its history, the first since 1990, and the first time without having Maradona in the team.Still, even with the Argentina icon, Napoli twice failed to get past the second round of the old European Cup after those 1987 and 1990 titles in Serie A.Napoli also never advanced past the round of 16 stage in the Champions League era that began in 1992. That looks set to change Wednesday.It is also a big step for Napoli’s veteran coach Luciano Spalletti, who has not taken a team to the Champions League quarterfinals since 2008 with Roma. This is Spalletti’s seventh try since then, though his first with Napoli after falling short with Roma, Zenit St. Petersburg and Inter Milan.Inter, which has not been to the quarterfinals since going out at that stage as the defending champion in 2011, takes a 1-0 lead to Porto in a finely balanced game Tuesday.Manchester City host Leipzig on Tuesday with the teams tied at 1-1.NAPOLI RESTEDA uniquely congested European season split in two by a break for the World Cup promised surprises and Napoli perhaps has benefited from having star players rested.Prolific strikers Victor Osimhen and Khvicha Kvaratskhelia were not involved in Qatar because their national teams Nigeria and Georgia, respectively, did not qualify.Eintracht’s star striker Randal Kolo Muani did go to the World Cup, almost winning the final for France with a last-minute chance, but will not play this week. Kolo Muani is suspended because of his red-card tackle in the first leg.Also missing in Naples could be the German club’s fans who local authorities want to ban from the city following clashes in Frankfurt three weeks ago.Eintracht won a court injunction Saturday against the ban though further legal action is expected before Wednesday.MADRID FAVOREDThe defending champion surely will not waste a three-goal lead against Liverpool in its own stadium.It is unlikely, though Madrid was eliminated as the title holder four years ago when taking a three-goal beating in the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in the round of 16. That was against a rampaging Ajax, which won 4-1 to overturn a 2-1 first-leg loss.Liverpool won that 2019 title but no team ever overcame a three-goal deficit in the second leg away from home in the Champions League.Liverpool perhaps could do it if the team that crushed Manchester United with six second-half goals in the Premier League a week ago shows up in Madrid. Probably not with the version that lost 1-0 at Bournemouth on Saturday.HOME COMFORTSManchester City is unbeaten at home in the Champions League for more than four years. That run includes a 6-3 win over Leipzig in the group stage two seasons ago.City also has also won all six home games in domestic competitions in 2023. Extending the streak to seven will send the club to the quarterfinals for the sixth straight year under coach Pep Guardiola in its quest to be European champion for the first time. Guardiola last lifted the trophy 12 years ago with Barcelona.DRAWS ON FRIDAYThe quarterfinals draw is made Friday at UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland. It is the first stage that teams from the same country can face each other.Pairings will also be drawn for the semifinals, plotting a path to the final on June 10 in Istanbul.Also on Friday, draws for the remaining knockout rounds are made in the second-tier Europa League and third-tier Europa Conference League.The round of 16, second-leg games in those competitions — involving Arsenal, Manchester United, Juventus, Roma and Shakhtar Donetsk — are played on Wednesday and Thursday. ___ More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/13,,World

The bank collapsed at a “stunning pace” after a run on deposits caused a liquidity crisis on Friday (March 10).Wang said that now the U.S government has stepped in and taken measures to minimize the damage, positive developments will be forthcoming. The U.S. Treasury announced on Sunday (March 12) that all depositors will be able to withdraw their funds from the failed bank, waiving the rule that only deposits under US$250,000 (NT$7,642,625) would be protected.Investors in the bank will not be bailed out, however, with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen saying “we’re not going to do that again.”According to Taiwan’s Financial Supervisory Commission, Taiwanese insurance and securities firms had no exposure to the Silicon Valley Bank, while Taiwanese trust funds had a NT$300 million exposure.The bank had US$189 billion invested in long term mortgage-backed securities in 2022, according to Forbes. This value was wiped out in less than 24 hours, in part due to a mixture of federal interest rate hikes creating fears of the bank’s ability to pay depositors, and an ensuing bank run.",2023/03/13,931,Business

At present, most of the solar photovoltaic (PV) panel installations in India are done using crystalline silicon, which improves the power efficiency by about 22% The National Solar Mission is one of the key initiatives to promote solar power expansion/generation. Solar power capacity has increased by more than 15 times in the last seven years, from 2.6 GW in March 2014 to 41.09 GW in May 2021.Segment insights:The solar energy market can be segmented on the basis of grid connected solar applications and off-grid solar applications. The grid connected solar application segment holds the largest market share. Application-wise status of installations under the Off-grid and Decentralised Solar PV Applications Programme is comparatively much lower than grid connected applications. Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) has aimed to provide solar PV-based applications in areas where grid power is either not available or is unreliable, with the help of its Off-grid Solar PV Applications Programme.COVID-19 impact analysis:In India, demand for electricity dropped when a lockdown was imposed during the first wave of COVID-19, causing commercial and office spaces to stay closed. This adversely impacted the demand for solar power. The supply side was also negatively impacted as 85% of the migrant labor in solar parks returned to their villages during the lockdown. With the easing of restrictions on movement, solar companies started procuring and setting up solar plants once again. The government also started promoting domestic solar products and introduced several policies to boost the solar energy market before and after the second wave of the pandemic. Given the government’s efforts to revive the market in light of the pandemic, solar energy along with other renewable resources may be dedicated to tackle climate change.Download Free Sample of This Strategic Report: -https://www.quadintel.com/request-sample/india-solar-energy-market/QI042Report Include:Market Behavior/ Level of Risk and Opportunity

After more than two years of pandemic, global economy began to recover, entering 2022, the Russian Federations invasion of Ukraine and its global effects on commodity markets, supply chains, inflation, and financial conditions have steepened the slowdown in global growth. In particular, the war in Ukraine is leading to soaring prices and volatility in energy markets, with improvements in activity in energy exporters more than offset by headwinds to activity in most other economies. The invasion of Ukraine has also led to a significant increase in agricultural commodity prices, which is exacerbating food insecurity and extreme poverty in many emerging market and developing economies.Numerous risks could further derail what is now a precarious recovery. Among them is, in particular, the possibility of stubbornly high global inflation accompanied by tepid growth, reminiscent of the stagflation of the 1970s. This could eventually result in a sharp tightening of monetary policy in advanced economies to rein in inflation, lead to surging borrowing costs, and possibly culminate in financial stress in some emerging market and developing economies. A forceful and wide-ranging policy response is required by policy makers in these economies and the global community to boost growth, bolster macroeconomic frameworks, reduce financial vulnerabilities, provide support to vulnerable population groups, and attenuate the long-term impacts of the global shocks of recent years.Download Free Sample of This Strategic Report:- https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=bis347644In this complex international situation, Report Ocean published Vegetable Carbon Products Market Status, Trends and COVID-19 Impact Report 2022, which provides a comprehensive analysis of the global market , This Report covers the manufacturer data, including: sales volume, price, revenue, gross margin, business distribution etc., these data help the consumer know about the competitors better.

After more than two years of pandemic, global economy began to recover, entering 2022, the Russian Federations invasion of Ukraine and its global effects on commodity markets, supply chains, inflation, and financial conditions have steepened the slowdown in global growth. In particular, the war in Ukraine is leading to soaring prices and volatility in energy markets, with improvements in activity in energy exporters more than offset by headwinds to activity in most other economies. The invasion of Ukraine has also led to a significant increase in agricultural commodity prices, which is exacerbating food insecurity and extreme poverty in many emerging market and developing economies.Numerous risks could further derail what is now a precarious recovery. Among them is, in particular, the possibility of stubbornly high global inflation accompanied by tepid growth, reminiscent of the stagflation of the 1970s. This could eventually result in a sharp tightening of monetary policy in advanced economies to rein in inflation, lead to surging borrowing costs, and possibly culminate in financial stress in some emerging market and developing economies.

After more than two years of pandemic, global economy began to recover, entering 2022, the Russian Federations invasion of Ukraine and its global effects on commodity markets, supply chains, inflation, and financial conditions have steepened the slowdown in global growth. In particular, the war in Ukraine is leading to soaring prices and volatility in energy markets, with improvements in activity in energy exporters more than offset by headwinds to activity in most other economies. The invasion of Ukraine has also led to a significant increase in agricultural commodity prices, which is exacerbating food insecurity and extreme poverty in many emerging market and developing economies.Numerous risks could further derail what is now a precarious recovery. Among them is, in particular, the possibility of stubbornly high global inflation accompanied by tepid growth, reminiscent of the stagflation of the 1970s. This could eventually result in a sharp tightening of monetary policy in advanced economies to rein in inflation, lead to surging borrowing costs, and possibly culminate in financial stress in some emerging market and developing economies.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833358,"WBC Overview and Predictions: Who Can Be A Potential Winner, and How Taiwan Will Do?","The World Baseball Classic, which determines the world champion of baseball, kicks off this Wednesday, March 8th. The WBC is usually held once every four years, but due to the corona pandemic, the 5th edition which was supposed to be held in 2021, was delayed by two years. In addition to the 16 teams that qualified for the main tournament based on the results from the previous edition, there are four teams that won the preliminary round, for a total of 20 teams.The tournament takes place in Taiwan, Japan as well as the US. In Taiwan, at the Taichung Intercontinental Baseball Stadium, will be the first round, games from the pool B that includes Taiwan. The quarter-final will be in Japan and the USA, followed by the semi-finals and final held at Lawn Depot Park in Miami, USA.Who Can Be This Year’s Winner?First and foremost, the question would be how the team Taiwan starts off with the group stage, but the other big question is which team will win this edition of the tournament. Currently, the United States and Dominican Republic whose rosters comprise mostly with MLB players, and  who have won the last two tournaments, are seen as closest to victory.A couple of our neighbors are also seen as one of the favorites to win. Japan is listed as the third strongest contenders by local Japanese bookmakers, after the US and the Dominican Republic. South Korea, who is also in the pool B with Japan, is within reach of winning the title as well.Quick Recap of the Past EditionsNow, let’s look back and do a quick recap of the history of WBC before the fifth edition begins. The first WBC was started by the initiative of MLB in the US. Taiwan was eliminated in the first round due to the withdrawal of some key players such as Wang Jianmin and Chen Chin-Feng. The second championship was held in 2009. Taiwan faced tough matches against South Korea and China, both of which Taiwan were defeated against, and was eliminated in the first round, just like previous time.In the next 3rd edition, as a result of the previous edition, Taiwan was required to compete from the qualifying round. The team Taiwan managed to advance to the main tournament, where they even made it through the first round with 2 wins and 1 loss against New Zealand, Thailand, and the Philippines. However they lost to Japan and Cuba in the second round and were eliminated.And in the 4th edition held in March 2017, Taiwan was regrettably eliminated in the first round without winning a single game. The past champions so far are Japan, who won the first two rounds, Dominican Republic, and the defending champion USA.What To Expect from the First Round This Year?In the first stage, Taiwan is in pool A alongside the Netherlands, Cuba and Panama. There is no doubt that Cuba, in particular, will be a tough opponent for Taiwan. Pool B, whose games take place in Japan, include team Japan, South Korea and China, and will involve a fierce battle between the three Asian teams, but also they should watch out for Australia and the Czech Republic, too.One of the groups whose first games are held in the US, pool C are United States, Mexico, Colombia, and Canada and Great Britain. Pool D, also starts in the US and is said to be the “group of death” has the powerhouses of Puerto Rico, Venezuela and Dominican Republic who have to fight for the positions of the top two. The competition is intense.In any case, Taiwan will be required to fight without loosening their guard.",2023/03/13,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833366,Missing Taiwanese soldier confirmed to be in China,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) on Monday (March 13) confirmed that a soldier who went missing on Thursday (March 9) from a base in Kinmen County is in China.During a meeting of the Internal Administration Committee of the Legislative Yuan, MAC Minister Chiu Tai-san (邱太三) faced questions from legislators about the fate of the missing soldier, who is surnamed Chen (陳), and what government departments are doing to address the situation. Prior to the meeting, Chiu confirmed to the media that Chen is in China.In the Legislative Yuan session, Chiu said that in addition to launching a search effort for Chen, the Ministry of National Defense (MND) conducted an inventory of equipment, while the Coast Guard Administration (CGA) scanned nearby waters. He said that on Friday evening (March 10) notice was received that Chen was in Xiamen, China.Legislators questioned whether poor communication channels between Taiwan and China could have led to the inefficient handling of Chen's disappearance. Chiu said the cross-strait situation is ""a bit complicated and ambiguous.""However, Chiu stressed that although there is competition and confrontation, the two sides of the strait still have mechanisms for handling matters such as economic and trade exchanges, financial activities, and fighting crime.Chiu said the status of the soldier and his motive for leaving the base are not yet understood. He said these questions must be addressed and China has an investigative mechanism to deal with this situation.He said the MND and CGA are both continuing to investigate the incident. On Thursday, the 26-year-old private first class from the Lieyu Garrison Battalion failed to appear during a roll call at his base on Erdan Island and was reported missing.According to the Criminal Code of the Armed Forces, soldiers who fail to return to their post for more than six days could face up to three years in prison or a maximum of NT$300,000 in fines.",2023/03/13,2839,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833379,Ke Huy Quan wins Oscar in an inspiring Hollywood comeback,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Ke Huy Quan had mostly disappeared from Hollywood for over two decades, dispirited by the lack of on-camera work for Asian Americans. He returned in a big way, winning the supporting actor Oscar to cap an inspiring comeback story.Quan accepted the trophy Sunday night for his role in “Everything Everywhere All at Once,” becoming just the second Asian winner ever in the supporting actor category, joining Haing S. Ngor for “The Killing Fields” in 1984.As his name was announced, Quan rose and hugged co-stars Michelle Yeoh and Jamie Lee Curtis, who won supporting actress honors after him. He clasped his hands to his mouth.“My mom is 84 years old and she’s at home watching,” Quan said. “Mom, I just won an Oscar!”An emotional Quan kissed his statue repeatedly and sniffled into the microphone on stage after receiving a standing ovation. Presenter Ariana DeBose was in tears.“My journey started on a boat. I spent a year in a refugee camp and somehow I ended up here on Hollywood’s biggest stage,” he said. “They say stories like this only happen in the movies. I can’t believe this is happening to me. This is the American dream.”As a child actor, Quan followed his manager's advice to adopt an Americanized name, so he went by Jonathan Ke Quan.“When I decided to get back into acting three years ago, the very first thing I wanted to do was to go back to my birth name,” he said backstage. “To see Ariana open that envelope and say Ke Huy Quan, it was so emotional.”Quan rode a huge wave of momentum into the Oscars, having won every major award except the BAFTA. Quan endeared himself during acceptance speeches as much as he did in his winning performance. He used his position to encourage other struggling actors that one day they also will find success.Along the awards show trail, the enormously likeable Quan compiled a photo album for the ages as he posed for selfies with everyone from Tom Cruise to directors James Cameron and Steven Spielberg. It seemed anyone famous was happy to smile or make funny faces alongside Quan.The Vietnam-born actor whose family immigrated to California in the late 1970s first gained attention as a pre-teen in the hugely popular 1980s movies ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" and “The Goonies.” He went on to roles in the TV show “Head of the Class” and the movie “Encino Man” (starring fellow Oscar nominee Brendan Fraser ) in the early 1990s before work dried up.Finding few on-camera opportunities, Quan turned elsewhere. He earned a film degree from the University of Southern California and worked behind the scenes as a stunt coordinator and assistant director.“I owe everything to the love of my life, my wife Echo,” he said, “who month after month, year after year for 20 years told me that one day, one day my time will come. Dreams are something you have to believe in. I almost gave up on mine. To all of you out there, please keep your dreams alive.”Inspired by the success of the 2018 movie “Crazy Rich Asians,” Quan returned to acting and landed an audition for “Everything Everywhere All at Once,” which earned a leading 11 Oscar nominations. His former “Goonies” co-star, Jeff Cohen, serves as his lawyer who drew up the contract for his Oscar-winning role.“Thank you to my ‘Goonies’ brother for life, Jeff Cohen,” Quan said.Now, people stop him to talk about a movie he made as a grown-up, “Everything Everywhere All at Once.""As Waymond Wang, Quan appears in three different incarnations in the critically acclaimed film. He won a Golden Globe and became the first Asian man to win an individual category at the SAG Awards.Quan won the Oscar over fellow nominees Brendan Gleeson and Barry Keoghan of “The Banshees of Inisherin,” Brian Tyree Henry of “Causeway” and Judd Hirsch of “The Fabelmans.”During a commercial break, Quan said he ran up to Spielberg, who gave Quan his first big break by casting him in “Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.” They hugged.“He said, ‘Ke, you are now an Oscar-winning actor,'” Quan said. “Hearing him say that meant the world to me and I still cannot believe it.”He had another reunion on stage after “Everything Everywhere All at Once” was announced as best picture by Harrison Ford, Quan's co-star in “Indiana Jones.”The 51-year-old Quan is set to appear in the Marvel Cinematic Universe series “Loki” on Disney+.However, he's in search of more work. Quan recalled years ago calling his agent every three and six months asking if there were any jobs for him only to be told no.“First thing tomorrow I'm going to call my agent,” he said. “Hopefully, he'll give me a different answer.”___For more coverage of this year’s Academy Awards, visit: https://apnews.com/hub/academy-awards",2023/03/13,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833380,Brendan Fraser wins best actor Oscar in career comeback,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Brendan Fraser won the best actor Oscar for “The Whale,” a transformative role in which he revived a career that was once so bright.“I started in this business 30 years ago and things didn’t come easily to me,” said an emotional Fraser, breathing heavily on stage Sunday night. “I just want to say thank you for this acknowledgement.”Fraser was one of five first-time nominees in the category, the first time that had happened since 1935. Fraser beat out Austin Butler of “Elvis,” Colin Farrell of “The Banshees of Inisherin,” Paul Mescal of “Aftersun,” and Bill Nighy of “Living.”Fraser figures the role of Charlie, a 600-pound reclusive gay English teacher who tries to restore his relationship with his teenage daughter, found him at the perfect time.Any earlier in his career and Fraser has said he wouldn't have had the life experience or heartache to authentically play a character who lives with sadness, pain and life-threatening obesity.“I think it’s a film that’s going to change some hearts and minds, and that feels really good,” he said backstage.Fraser's portrayal earned him standing ovations at film festivals in Venice and Toronto, and the early praise continued building through the fall and winter. In addition to receiving the best reviews of his career, he earned a SAG Award for his performance. Along the way, he's given emotional acceptance speeches, unafraid to cry at times.His eyes were rimmed red as he clutched his Oscar in one hand, clearly moved by the reaction from his Hollywood peers.“This has been incredibly rewarding and affirming,” he said backstage, “and it’s given me a lesson in humility and gratitude.”It's a career comeback, which Hollywood has always loved.The 54-year-old Canadian American actor broke out in the early 1990s with the comedy “Encino Man” and the drama “School Ties.” He was the face on movie posters for ""George of the Jungle” and “The Mummy” trilogy, where he worked with fellow Oscar nominee Michelle Yeoh. He did dramatic turns in “Gods and Monsters,” “The Quiet American” and 2006 best picture winner “Crash.”He had his share of projects that bombed, too.Then Fraser all but disappeared.He was off the big screen for several years dealing with a series of personal issues involving divorce, his mother's death, health problems and an alleged assault by the then-president of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association. He boycotted this year's Golden Globes as a result.He regained career momentum with a series of cable TV shows before appearing in director Steven Soderbergh's movie “No Sudden Move” two years ago.Now, he owns one of the biggest prizes in movies.“I hope I live up to this,” he said.___For more on this year’s Oscars, visit: https://apnews.com/hub/academy-awards",2023/03/13,,World

Those cheers got even louder in the fourth for his encore, which was a blast deep into the left-center seats that brought home Randy Arozarena and Alex Verdugo and made it 7-1.Meneses hit his first homer off starter Nick Martinez, who took the loss, and the second off Brady Singer. Mexico starter Patrick Sandoval gave up one run over three innings, earning the win.The 30-year-old Meneses became an unlikely MLB slugger in 2022 after spending over a decade in the minors and playing overseas. He debuted with the Nationals last season, batting .324 with 13 homers in just 222 at-bats.Mexico kept piling onto the lead in the eighth, sending nine players to the plate and scoring four runs off Daniel Bard to make it 11-2.The Americans scored three runs in the eighth to make the final outcome more respectable. Tim Anderson had two hits and three RBIs, while Will Smith hit a solo homer.In Tokyo, Japan won Group B with a 4-0 record and will play a quarterfinal Thursday against Italy, which advanced along with Cuba from Group A on tiebreakers. Matt Harvey got the win as Italy defeated the Netherlands 7-1, causing all five teams to finish 2-2.South Korea beat the Czech Republic 7-3 in the day’s other Group B game, and Cuba defeated Taiwan 7-1 in Group A.In Group C, Canada beat Britain 18-8 before Mexico’s big win over the U.S. In Group D, Venezuela beat Puerto Rico 9-6 and Israel topped Nicaragua 3-1.AUSTRALIA 8, CZECH REPUBLIC 3TOKYO (AP) -- Australia defeated the Czech Republic 6-3 on Monday and advanced to the quarterfinals.It’s the first time Australia has reached the second round after appearing in all four previous tournaments.Australia finished 3-1 in Group B behind Japan, which was 4-0.Australia will face Cuba, the top team in Group A, in one quarterfinal. Japan will play Italy, which finished second in Group A in Taichung, Taiwan. Both quarterfinals are at the Tokyo Dome.Logan Wade’s two-run double in the seventh off the right field wall broke a 1-1 tie and drove in Robbie Glendinning and Aaron Whitefield.Australia took a 1-0 lead in the first on Alex Hall’s solo homer off Martin Schneider. It was the only run — and only hit —- that Schneider gave up in going 5 1/3 innings. He was pulled after reaching the 65-pitch limit, giving up one hit, and one run with one strikeout.The Czech Republic tied it at 1 in the third on Eric Sogard’s single that scored Petr Zyma.Australia padded its lead by making it 6-1 in the eighth, and again it was Hall -- this time with a triple -- that scored Ulrich Bojarski and Tim Kennelly. Glendinning’s subsequent single added another.Marek Chlup’s two-run single in the eighth narrowed the margin to 6-3, but Australia replied with two more of its own in the ninth.JAPAN 7, AUSTRALIA 1TOKYO (AP) — Shohei Ohtani hit a three-run homer that landed just below his image on a video advertising board, sending Japan to a win over Australia on Sunday.Ohtani also walked twice and finished with four RBIs. His first-inning drive traveled an estimated 448 feet.Ohtani turned on a hanging curveball from Will Sherriff, who didn’t even watch the flight of the ball into the Tokyo Dome’s right-field seats, bending and putting hands on his knees. It was the first home run of the tournament for Ohtani, who is 6 for 12 with eight RBIs and seven walks.Winner Yoshinobu Yamamoto struck out eight in four scoreless innings, allowing one hit and no walks. He threw 42 of 60 pitches for strikes, averaging 95.2 mph with his fastball and topping out at 96.9 mph. The 24-year-old right-hander was the Pacific League’s MVP for the Orix Buffaloes in 2021 and 2022, and pitched a no-hitter last June 22 against the Saitama Seibu Lions.Robbie Perkins was the only Australia batter to reach against Yamamato, on a one-out single in the third. Alex Hall homered in the ninth off Hiroto Takahashi, who finished a five-hitter.VENEZUELA 9, PUERTO RICO 6MIAMI (AP) — Salvador Pérez homered, doubled twice, singled and had five RBIs as Venezuela improved to 2-0 in Group D on Sunday.Venezuela struck quickly with a four-run first against Puerto Rico starter José Berrios. Pérez hit an RBI single and Anthony Santander followed with his second homer of the tournament, a three-run drive that cleared the wall in right.Pérez made it 7-0 with a three-run shot off reliever Fernando Cruz in the second.Venezuela starter Pablo López was the beneficiary of the early run support. López struck out six, while limiting Puerto Rico to one run and two hits in 4 2/3 innings.Eddie Rosario homered for Puerto Rico, which is 1-1.Down 9-1, Puerto Rico tried to rally with a four-run sixth against reliever Andres Machado.MJ Melendez’s RBI double in the eighth got Puerto Rico within three before Silvino Bracho relieved Jhoulys Chacin and retired Javier Baez on a pop out and Rosario on a double-play grounder. Bracho then pitched a perfect ninth for the save.CANADA 18, BRITAIN 8, 7 INNINGSPHOENIX (AP) — Tyler O’Neill had four hits and four RBIs, Freddie Freeman added two hits and Canada beat Britain 18-8 on Sunday.The game lasted just seven innings because the WBC has a mercy rule during group play. If one team is leading by 10 or more runs after an inning following the seventh, the game is over.Canada scored in every inning, including five runs in the first, four in the third and six more in the fourth.Britain took a 3-0 lead in the top of the first, but had a tough afternoon on the pitcher’s mound, giving up 17 hits and 16 walks. Harry Ford had one of Britain’s highlights with a three-run homer.Akeel Morris took the loss, giving up five runs in just 2/3 of an inning. Phillippe Aumont got the win.ISRAEL 3, NICARAGUA 1MIAMI (AP) — Garrett Stubbs hit a two-run double in a three-run eighth inning, helping Israel rally for the win in its WBC opener Sunday.Stubbs had two of Israel’s seven hits.

But it dropped to 0-2 in WBC group play.ITALY 7, NETHERLANDS 1TAICHUNG, Taiwan (AP) — Harvey pitched four innings of one-run ball for Italy, and Milwaukee Brewers prospect Sal Frelick had three hits and two RBIs Sunday.Italian players had to wait a few minutes after the final out to find out they advanced with Cuba while the Netherlands, Taiwan and Panama were eliminated.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833382,Antiwar ‘All Quiet’ wins the Oscar for international film,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — The war movie that abhors war has won an Oscar for best international film, along with three other statues.“All Quiet on the Western Front,” starring Felix Kammerer and directed and co-written by Edward Berger, earned nine nominations, including best picture.It also won for cinematography, production design and original score Sunday night.“I think it might feel incredible but I don’t quite know yet because I haven’t processed it yet,” Berger said backstage. “I'm a little bit on autopilot.”Berger was joined onstage by Kammerer as well as others involved in the film.“This was your first movie and you carried us on your shoulders as it was nothing,” he told the 27-year-old Austrian actor. “Without you, none of us would be here.”The Netflix film is based on the classic 1929 novel of the same name by Erich Maria Remarque. Set during World War I, it follows the life of a young German soldier who enlists in the army with his friends. But the realities of war shatter his hopes of becoming a hero and he focuses on his own survival.“We tried to make a film about our past, about our responsibility in Germany and with our history,” Berger said. “Our urge was to talk about our guilt and our shame that we’ve brought and the terror that the two wars have caused in the world. Hopefully, at some point we will stop making the same mistakes in the future.”The German-language film doesn't hew exactly to Remarque's novel. Instead, it deviates into political issues against the backdrop of the war. It premiered last year, when Russia invaded Ukraine in the biggest military conflict in Europe since World War II, lending an unexpected relevancy to the movie.“It's absolutely terrible,” cinematography winner James Friend said of the war in Ukraine. “It's a lesson that we can just sort of learn from really.”""All Quiet on the Western Front” won seven BAFTA trophies, including best film.Berger said he was happy, proud and grateful that Hollywood embraced the movie.“I think we do have a little bit of an inferiority complex as German moviemakers because we feel like a small country with less stars and less visibility as opposed to England and America,” he said. “I hope this gives me and a few others a bit of confidence to say, ‘Let’s just do it, let’s just do our movies.’”The original American movie starring Lew Ayres debuted in 1930 and won Oscars for best picture and best director.It was later made into a television movie starring Richard Thomas and Ernest Borgnine, winning an Emmy and a Golden Globe.“All Quiet on the Western Front” beat out “Argentina, 1985” from Argentina, “Close” from Belgium, “EO” from Poland and “The Quiet Girl” from Ireland.___For more coverage of this year’s Academy Awards, visit: https://apnews.com/hub/academy-awards",2023/03/13,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833383,Flames beat Senators 5-1 for 3rd win in four games,"CALGARY, Alberta (AP) — Elias Lindholm, Jonathan Huberdeau and Rasmus Andersson each had a goal and an assist, and the Calgary Flames beat the Ottawa Senators 5-1 Sunday night.Trevor Lewis and Noah Hanafin also scored, and Nazem Kadri and Mikael Backlund each had two assists as the Flames won for the third time in four games. Jacob Markstrom stopped 30 shots.“I thought we had good pace to our game all night,” Flames coach Darryl Sutter said. “When they did score, we came right back. ... Marky made some big saves.”Calgary remained six points behind Winnipeg — which who won 3-2 at Tampa Bay earlier Sunday — for the second wild card in the Western Conference.“We got to collect points as much as we can here in the stretch,” Kadri said. “Overall, I think just the whole 60 minutes is pretty positive for us. We made a lot of great plays and hopefully its something we can build on.”Tim Stutzle scored his 32nd goal for Ottawa, and Kevin Mandolese finished with 35 saves to lose for the second time in the rookie's three career starts. The Senators have lost three of four after winning five straight.The Senators are six points behind the New York Islanders for the second wild card in the Eastern Conference.“We didn’t play our worst game but everything didn’t go the way we wanted it to,” Stutzle said. “The last two games aren’t the way we want to play. You just have to turn the page. But it’s definitely really frustrating right now.”Adding to the challenge for the Senators is they also have to pass Florida and Washington, who are between them and the Islanders.“We have a ton of belief in our group,” Ottawa defenseman Travis Hamonic said. “We’ve been resilient all season. We’ve played through a ton of adversity. We’ve clawed our way back into the race and into the conversation when everyone left us on the side of the road a couple months ago.”Andersson opened the scoring with 7:51 left in the first as he got a pass back from Backlund on a rush and fired a shot past Mandolese from the slot for his ninth goal of the season.Lindholm made it 2-0 as he scored from a sharp angle from the left side off a cross-ice pass across the front of the goal from Backlund for his 19th with 1:34 left in the first.Stutzle took advantage of an unfortunate deflection by the Flames to get the Senators on the board at 5:55 of the second. Backlund's pass behind the net hit off Markstrom's leg and went in front of the net, where Stutlze tapped it into the open net.Huberdeau redirected a pass from Kadri in the air over Mandolese's shoulder to restore the Flames' two-goal lead 1:08 later. It was his 13th.“(Kadri) pass it to me and it hit the stick, I don't know, I just try to deflect it a little bit,” Huberdeau said. “I got lucky with that, it finally went in. ... It was quick. I'm glad it looked good.”Sutter added: “That's a big play in the game.”Hanafin made it 4-1 as he got a pass from Kadri and beat Mandolese from the left circle for his fifth with 6:52 left in the middle period.Lewis jumped on a loose puck in front and whipped it in for his ninth at 5:30 of the third to cap the scoring.LINDHOLM’S MILESTONE GOALLindholm’s goal was the 200th of his career — including 136 with the Flames. He’s fourth for the most goals by a Swede in franchise history behind Kent Nilsson (229), Hakan Loob (193) and Backlund (180).POWER OUTAGEThe Senators went 0 for 4 with the man advantage and are now 0 for 20 over their last six games.UP NEXTSenators: At Edmonton on Tuesday night to finish a five-game trip.Flames: At Arizona on Tuesday night to open a two-game trip.___AP NHL: https://www.apnews.com/hub/NHL and https://www.twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/13,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833384,"‘Everything Everywhere’ duo win directing, writing Oscars","LOS ANGELES (AP) — The writing-and-directing duo the Daniels won three Oscars apiece on a dominant night for “Everything Everywhere All at Once.”In victories that were entirely expected Sunday but might have seemed like a sci-fi fantasy a year ago, Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert won Academy Awards for best director and best original screenplay, two of seven won by their multiversal dramedy. The Daniels topped talented fields that included Hollywood royalty Steven Spielberg in both categories.And they each get to take home a best picture Oscars as producers of the film.“There is greatness in every single person,” Kwan said as he accepted best director. “It doesn’t matter who we are. There is genius in every single person, you just have to find it. Thank you to the people who unlocked my genius.”But Kwan assured his young son he would not foist similar expectations on him.“This is not normal, this is kind of crazy,” he said. “I will love you no matter what.”The Daniels came into the night the favorites for the directing Oscar, and “ Everything Everywhere All at Once,” the top nominee with 11, had immense awards season momentum. It also won best actress for Michelle Yeoh, best supporting actor for Ke Huy Quan and best supporting actress for Jamie Lee Curtis.Scheinert dedicated the director Oscar to “all the mommies in the world,” and to his own parents.“Thank you for not squashing my creativity when I was making really disturbing horror films or really perverted comedy films or dressing in drag as a kid, which is a threat to nobody,” he said.When they won for screenplay, Scheinert railed off the names of his favorite school teachers, saying, “you guys all inspired me and taught me to be less of a butthead.”And Kwan said “my impostor syndrome is at an all-time high.” He called Scheinert “my confidence. He is the person who told me I was a storyteller before I believed it.”Each 35 years old, the Daniels were the youngest and least experienced filmmakers in a group of directing nominees that also included 76-year-old Spielberg (""The Fabelmans""), 48-year-old Ruben Östlund (“Triangle of Sadness”) 59-year-old Todd Field (“Tár”) and 52-year-old Martin McDonagh (“The Banshees of Inisherin”).Their wins come almost exactly a year after the film's release. The Daniels' only previous feature was the oddball dead-body comedy “Swiss Army Man."" At the time it might have seemed a pipedream that such a pair would win the best director Oscar that has eluded star filmmakers from Alfred Hitchcock to Ridley Scott to Quentin Tarantino.But “Everything Everywhere,” which mixed the same kind of strangeness with elements of Hollywood sci-fi and action epics, stirred buzz - and inspired memes - from the start and became a magnet for awards in recent months.Kwan becomes the third winner of Asian descent to win a directing Oscar. Chloe Zhao and Bong Joon also won the prize. The film was a boon for Asian actors, who were cast in most of the major roles, including Michelle Yeoh, Stephanie Hsu and Ke Huy Quan, all of whom got Oscar nominations, with Quan and Yeoh winning and Hsu losing to castmate Curtis.The Daniels are the third directing duo to win an Oscar. Jerome Robbins and Robert Wise won for the original “West Side Story” in 1962, and brothers Joel and Ethan Coen won for “No Country for Old Men” in 2008.They are also among the youngest to win the award. “La La Land” director Damien Chazelle was the youngest at 32 in 2017.Last month they won the Directors Guild of America Award, which has proven to be a strong predictor of Oscar victory.Spielberg had once been expected to cruise through awards season with his autobiographical “The Fabelmans,” but the late surge in affection for “Everything Everywhere All at Once” proved too much.Scheinert, from Birmingham, Alabama, and Kwan, from Westborough, Massachusetts, met while studying film at Emerson College in Boston.They began their career making music videos before moving on to features, occasionally directing episodes of television.There were no female directors nominated in the category. After two years of trend-bucking with back-to-back wins for women in the category, the Academy returned to its historic norm of nominating male directors only.___Follow AP Entertainment Writer Andrew Dalton on Twitter: https://twitter.com/andyjamesdalton___ For more coverage of this year’s Academy Awards, visit: https://apnews.com/hub/academy-awards",2023/03/13,,World

Action in the 68-team tournament begins Tuesday with two games in the First Four. March Madness gets into full swing Thursday and Friday with 32 games spread over eight cities. The Final Four is set for April 1 and 3 at NRG Stadium in Houston.Arizona State and Nevada made it off the bubble, as most expected, and into the 68-team field. Rutgers and Oklahoma State did not. And in a decision most everyone saw coming, the selection committee left North Carolina, last year’s national runner-up, out of the tournament. It made the Tar Heels the first team to start the season ranked No. 1 in the Associated Press Top 25 and finish it by not making the Big Dance.LAWRENCE, Kan. (AP) — Kansas coach Bill Self was discharged from a Kansas City-area hospital Sunday, where he’d been recovering after a procedure to treat blocked arteries in his heart, and the Hall of Famer will rejoin the No. 3 Jayhawks for the defense of their NCAA championship this week.His longtime assistant, Norm Roberts, said Sunday night Self would probably be back in the office on Monday to begin preparing for Howard. That’s who the top-seeded Jayhawks will open the NCAA Tournament against on Thursday in Des Moines, Iowa, after they were surprisingly put in the West Region by the selection committee.WOMEN'S NCAA TOURNAMENTSouth Carolina is six wins away from becoming the 10th women’s basketball team to go undefeated for an entire season, and the Gamecocks will enter the NCAA Tournament as the No. 1 overall seed.Dawn Staley’s squad has been challenged a few times this year but has always pulled through. The defending national champions will play Norfolk State in the first round of the tournament.The other No. 1 seeds are Indiana, Virginia Tech and Stanford. The tournament begins Wednesday with four First Four games and the full madness starts Friday.PRO FOOTBALLMIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (AP) — The Miami Dolphins are acquiring All-Pro cornerback Jalen Ramsey in a trade with the Los Angeles Rams, two people with knowledge of the deal told The Associated Press on Sunday.The Rams will get Miami’s third-round pick in the 2023 NFL draft and tight end Hunter Long, according to the people, who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because neither team had announced the deal.The Rams went 5-12 last season and missed the playoffs just one year after winning the Super Bowl, and they’ve have been making changes to their roster this offseason. Los Angeles parted ways with veteran linebacker Bobby Wagner last month after one season.The Rams traded for Ramsey in the middle of the 2019 season after he spent the first four years of his career in Jacksonville. Ramsey, a six-time Pro Bowl selection, had 77 tackles and four interceptions during the Rams’ Super Bowl-winning 2021 season. Last season, he had a career-high 88 tackles and four interceptions.WASHINGTON (AP) — The Washington Commanders are keeping Daron Payne around, thanks to the second-biggest contract for a defensive tackle behind only seven-time All-Pro Aaron Donald.The Commanders agreed to terms with Payne on a four-year contract worth $90 million, with $60 million guaranteed, according to a person with knowledge of the deal. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity Sunday because the contract had not been announced. The deal was first reported by ESPN.Donald signed a contract last year with the Los Angeles Rams that paid him $95 million, with $65 million guaranteed.Payne led Washington with a career-high 11 1/2 sacks last season. The Commanders put the franchise tag worth $18.9 million on him last month in the hopes of working out a long-term agreement.GOLFPONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Scottie Scheffler took on the scary TPC Sawgrass as if he was playing alone. And by the time he got done with a masterful performance Sunday in The Players Championship, that’s about how it looked.Scheffler ran off five straight birdies in the middle of his round, built a six-shot lead and left all the drama to everyone else on his way to a 3-under 69 to win the richest prize on the PGA Tour by five shots.The victory was worth $4.5 million and sent Scheffler back to No. 1 in the world for the second time this year. He now has six victories in his last 27 starts on the PGA Tour, including the four wins he had last year culminated by his Masters title.When he poured in a 20-foot par putt on the final hole, Scheffler had the largest margin of victory in The Players since Stephen Ames won by six in 2006.SOCCERMADRID (AP) — Real Madrid will side against Barcelona in the legal proceedings that the rival is facing over its payments of millions of euros over several years to a company that belonged to the vice president of Spain’s soccer refereeing committee, Madrid said Sunday after an urgent board meeting.The decision came two days after prosecutors formally accused Barcelona of alleged corruption in sports, fraudulent management and falsification of mercantile documentation. An investigating judge will decide whether the accusations should lead to charges.GENEVA (AP) — A spying operation on behalf of World Cup host Qatar bugged a 2017 hotel meeting between FIFA president Gianni Infantino and Switzerland’s then-attorney general during an investigation of soccer officials, Swiss daily Neue Zürcher Zeitung said Sunday.The report said intelligence operatives linked to a former CIA officer wiretapped a meeting involving Infantino and Swiss federal prosecutor Michael Lauber at a Qatari-owned hotel in Bern, which also then housed the emirate’s embassy.The NZZ report said documents and sources showed the surveillance was carried out for “Project Matterhorn” — named for the iconic Swiss mountain — to gather material on Lauber.BASEBALLTOKYO (AP) — Shohei Ohtani hit a three-run homer that landed just below his image on a video advertising board, sending Japan to a 7-1 victory over Australia in the World Baseball Classic on Sunday night.Ohtani also walked twice and finished with four RBIs. His first-inning drive traveled an estimated 448 feet.Japan won Group B with a 4-0 record and will play a quarterfinal Thursday against Italy, which advanced along with Cuba from Group A on tiebreakers. Matt Harvey got the win as Italy defeated the Netherlands 7-1, causing all five teams to finish 2-2.South Korea beat the Czech Republic 7-3 in the day’s other Group B game, and Cuba defeated Taiwan 7-1 in Group A.Also, Joey Meneses hit two homers, including a three-run shot in the fourth inning, to lead Mexico to an 11-5 win over the United StatesAUTO RACINGAVONDALE, Ariz. (AP) — William Byron won his second straight NASCAR Cup Series race, taking advantage of a pair of late cautions to give the rolling Hendrick Motorsports team a victory in overtime at Phoenix Raceway on Sunday.Byron’s No. 24 Chevrolet got a great start in overtime with two laps left, and just like he did a week earlier at Las Vegas, he overtook teammate Kyle Larson for the win. He also had to hold off Ryan Blaney, who finished second, while Tyler Reddick was third.Byron denied Kevin Harvick a chance to win his 10th race at Phoenix. Harvick’s Stewart-Haas No. 4 Ford passed Larson for the lead with 44 laps remaining, taking advantage of the long run under green-flag conditions that favored his car all afternoon.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833388,"Oscars fashion: Fan Bingbing, Angela Bassett regal in 2 ways","NEW YORK (AP) — Fan Bingbing made a regal entrance in sparkling silver and emerald green on the champagne-colored carpet Sunday at the 95th Academy Awards. Hong Chau wore a high-neck pink Prada column gown with a feathery black train and Malala Yousafzai worked the hood of her silver sparkler from Ralph Lauren like a pro.Bingbing, the “X-Men” star, wore Tony Ward Couture with her hair sculpted into an Old Hollywood bob, as some of the men among the early walkers brought the sparkle. We're looking at you Lorenzo Zurzolo. Others, like Brendan Fraser, went for traditional black tuxedos.While Bingbing looked like a queen, Sofia Carson was a princess in white custom Giambattista Valli haute couture, a stunning statement diamond and emerald necklace accenting her ball gown with its off-shoulder, form-fitting bodice, a delicate diamond-shaped cutout at the center. Her jewels were by Chopard, including 122.49 carats of emeralds and 92.57 carats of diamonds.Also looking royal was Angela Bassett in Moschino. The dress by Jeremy Scott included draping that looked like a huge bow up top as the fabric swirled around her body. She was perfectly accented with a serpent Bulgari necklace.“It's light, it's royal purple, our color for royalty,"" she told E!. ""Just bringing that to the carpet. And, also spring.”Yousafzai, 25, was a producer on “Stranger at the Gate.” She said her dress represented “peace, love, harmony.”“I feel so much myself in it,” she told The Associated Press.Rihanna helped close down the carpet in custom Alaia, a leather band dress she wore over a jersey bodysuit as she showed off her baby bump. Lady Gaga snagged a black Versace look off the runway from the fashion house's show last week in Los Angeles. It featured boning under a sheer top with sheer sleeves and a ballgown skirt with a drop waist. Around her neck was a Tiffany & Co. diamond choker.Cate Blanchett donned a never-before-seen blue draped velvet top from the Louis Vuitton archives. She wore it with a black skirt made of fully sustainable silk.Monica Barbaro practiced her carpet walk in a two-tone Elie Saab ballgown of deep plumb and delicate blue chiffon with a long full train.“They were the first couture house to loan to me when nobody knew who I was,” she told E!Cara Delevingne repped young Hollywood well in a gorgeous red silk taffeta ballgown with a thigh-high slit and one shoulder with a billowing bow. She paired the look with a Bulgari serpent choker in white gold with emeralds for the eyes of the snake.“Cara’s smoky pink eyeshadow is so fresh and modern. She looks so fresh faced yet simultaneously glamorous,” said Danielle James, beauty director for Elle.com.Florence Pugh went in a different direction with a super-mini look in black under a voluminous strapless top that fell into billowy sleeves and yards of long fabric in a greyish white. It was Valentino Haute Couture. She had a Tiffany & Co. diamond necklace around her neck with matching pink tourmaline earrings.Halle Bailey did the young proud as well in an ethereal strapless soft blue gown by Dolce & Gabbana, with sheer panels at the skirt and boning on top. So did Janelle Monáe in a Vera Wang look that fell from a strapless black crop top to an orange skirt. She wore a black fabric choker around her neck.Jamie Lee Curtis went for a long-sleeve sparkler by Dolce & Gabbana that was the precise color of the Oscars' new off-white carpet.Harvey Guillen and Harry Shum Jr. made statements of their own, the former in a Christian Siriano coat with a silver brocade design and a full ruffled coat and the latter in a white evening jacket with a wide sash and black trim.“Puss in Boots” star Guillen said his outfit is the first time Siriano has designed for a plus-size man.The dramatic, embellished long coat flared out at the waist. It evoked Guillen’s vampire mockumentary show “What We Do in the Shadows,” on which he plays fan favorite Guillermo.Shum made sure to grab supporting actress nominee Chau to compliment her bubblegum pink frock while chatting with friends.“You look amazing,” he said.“The Whale” actor replied he did too.“I try to change it up,” Shum said.Lilly Singh donned Siriano, who managed to salvage his Oscar looks last week after a pipe burst in his studio. Singh's magenta trouser look was topped with a long matching coat.Sandra Oh's orange look popped against the lighter carpet. Like Chau, Allison Williams went for soft pink, with lots of sparkle, while Mindy Kaling stunned in bright white, a bustier look by Vera Wang with detached overlong sleeves and open boning. Also in white: Ariana DeBose in a standout Versace moment with jeweled embellishment made to evoke armor.Williams' Giambattista Valli look came with chunky embellishment, a feather-trimmed hem and a pink taffeta tulle cape.The beauty games were strong as well. Oh's updo was perfect for her flowy look, also from Giambattista Valli.“I love the messy updo with a bang. It juxtaposes with the orange dress so nicely. Her light and airy look matches the vibe,” said James, the Elle beauty expert.James Hong was 3 months old when the first Oscars were handed out in 1929. At 94, he’s finally made the show.Wearing a bow tie with googly eyes, the “Everything Everywhere All At Once” actor arrived in his typically playful mood for the Oscars, pulling faces and camping it up for the cameras.Eva Longoria also wore white, a heavily beaded look by Zuhair Murad that featured an open neckline to the waist.There was a healthy showing of black as well, led by Danai Gurira in classic Jason Wu, her hair worn high to, as she told reporters, honor the women who carry things with grace and beauty on the tops of their heads. Phoebe Waller-Bridge also went for black. The strapless look came with a Bulgari serpent choker set in pink gold with diamonds and another set of emeralds for eyes.Stylist and men's fashion blogger Peter Nguyen had some standouts, including Riz Ahmed.“His edgy, wide collar open shirt continues the theme of Young Hollywood making more statements by going against the grain of tradition,” Nguyen said.His fav, though, was Questlove in a tone-on-tone black suit, shirt and tie with a minimal topcoat he called both “elegant and flattering.” On Questlove's feet were rubbery comfy shoes.Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson sported a satin double-breasted dinner jacket in ballet pink.Fashion expert Melissa Rivers, daughter of the late “Fashion Police” host Joan Rivers, loved all the tidy hair, white and statement jewelry.“Some of the women that we really look to are showing us glimpses of what we're going to see next. We're getting away from the big ballgowns and going with the column,” she said.She includes Jessica Chastain in custom silver crystal Gucci among them. Chastain paired her strapless column gown and black train with a gold Lionhead Gucci necklace featuring 80 carats of green tsavorites and diamonds.Erika Harwood, senior style editor for Byrdie, noted a strong showing in “truly vintage looks and pieces"" pulled from designers' archives.Also among them: Winnie Harlow in an archival Y2K look from Armoni Prive, Vanessa Hudgins in vintage Chanel, Rooney Mara in 2008 Alexander McQueen and Zoe Saldana in vintage Cartier jewels.Tiffany Reid, senior vice president of fashion for Bustle, cited white as a huge trend.“White was the color of the evening, giving angelic on the champagne carpet,"" she said. “Emily Blunt in Valentino, Michelle Yeoh in Dior, Tems in Lever Couture, Mindy Kaling in Vera Wang, Halle Berry, Rooney Mara in McQueen, Michelle Williams in Chanel.”But her two best dressed were Bassett (in purple) and Chau (in pink). Her glam queen was Gurira, with her hair tribute to “beauty inspired by African women.” Shum made Reid's best-dressed list for the men, along with Lukas Dhont, Michael B. Jordan, Paul Mescal and Austin Butler.Cassie Anderson, fashion director for Cosmopolitan, noted a wealth of rosettes, including those on the looks of Nicole Kidman and Berry. And she, too, saw white as a strong trend, along with metallics like those of Yousafzai and Williams.“Studies suggest that gold is the luckiest color to wear to the Oscars,” Anderson said, “but white was THE color.”___For more coverage of this year’s Academy Awards, visit: https://apnews.com/hub/academy-awards",2023/03/13,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833407,Maximizing Efficiency: How Control Systems Streamline Manufacturing Processes,"Manufacturing is a complex process that encompasses various activities, from raw material acquisition to final product assembly. With so many moving parts, it can be challenging to ensure optimal efficiency and productivity throughout the entire production cycle. Fortunately, modern control systems offer an effective solution.Define Control Systems: Control systems are engineered to automate and streamline manufacturing processes, giving companies unprecedented efficiency and productivity gains. By taking advantage of control system capabilities, companies can optimize production, minimize downtime, and eliminate errors – ultimately increasing profits and competitiveness in the marketplace.Control systems come in many shapes and sizes, from basic programmable logic controllers (PLCs) to more sophisticated distributed control systems (DCS) and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) devices. All of these systems share one important trait: their capacity for automating routine tasks and procedures – freeing up human workers for higher-level activities like problem-solving or innovation.One way control systems can simplify manufacturing is the use of automated guided vehicles (AGVs). AGVs are self-guided vehicles used to transport materials and products between different areas within a manufacturing facility. By automating the routing and movement of AGVs using control systems, companies can optimize material flow while minimizing delays or errors.Another example of how control systems can enhance efficiency is through predictive maintenance. Predictive maintenance utilizes data analytics and machine learning algorithms to predict when equipment will need maintenance, enabling operators to take preventive action before an actual breakdown occurs.By collecting information on key performance indicators like equipment temperature or vibration, companies can forecast when repairs are necessary and schedule them proactively, reducing downtime while increasing overall equipment effectiveness (OEE).One of the primary advantages of control systems is their capacity for automating routine tasks and procedures. This frees human workers up to focus on higher-level activities, like problem-solving or innovation. For instance, control systems can automate production line monitoring and adjustment tasks, eliminating human intervention while minimizing errors or delays.Control systems offer real-time monitoring and diagnostic capabilities, enabling operators to quickly detect and resolve any problems that arise. This helps prevent downtime, minimizing disruptions to productivity. Furthermore, control systems collect data on key performance indicators like throughput or cycle time so companies can track their progress and identify areas for improvement.Another crucial advantage of control systems is their capacity to enhance safety in the workplace. Monitoring environmental conditions like temperature and pressure, as well as detecting potential safety hazards like leaks or equipment failures, allows these systems to prevent accidents and injuries and guarantee workers are working in a secure environment.Implementing a control system isn’t just an initial endeavor. It requires ongoing upkeep, upgrades, and adjustments to guarantee it meets the demands of the manufacturing facility. Furthermore, training employees on how to utilize and interpret data from the system is paramount for maximizing its advantages.When implementing a control system for manufacturing facilities, it’s essential to have an extensive understanding of their goals and objectives. This will guarantee that the system is designed and implemented with these objectives in mind. Furthermore, having an experienced team who can guide implementation as well as provide ongoing support and maintenance is paramount.It is important to remember that implementing a control system is not an “all-inclusive” solution.

This may involve connecting multiple systems or using advanced analytics and machine learning algorithms in order to maximize production and efficiency.In short, the advantages of control systems in manufacturing are abundant. By automating repetitive tasks, providing real-time monitoring and diagnostic capabilities, and improving safety protocols, companies can achieve greater efficiency and productivity than ever before. By taking advantage of these technologies, businesses can stay ahead of the competition in an ever-evolving manufacturing landscape.",2023/03/13,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833442,Composing the Oscar-winning 'All Quiet on the Western Front' score,"Director Edward Berger's anti-war drama has won four Oscars, out of nine nominations. The film has also picked up seven BAFTAs, including for best film.German composer Volker Bertelmann, better known as Hauschka, has also received an Academy Award for best original score.Ahead of the award ceremony, the musician told DW about his approach to composing for this film.DW:  You've worked with director Edward Berger several times. What was your first thought when you were asked to write the music for ""All Quiet on the Western Front""?My first thought was actually, ""Definitely do it!"" — and the second thought was: How do I tell this German story about the war in a manner that leaves it up to people to make up their own minds and to find their own interpretation without pushing them toward one point of view?Did you write the music during the making of the film, or afterwards?The film was already finished. I was invited to Berlin for the screening, and it was very clear to me that this was going to be an impressive film.The next day I had the first theme, the harmonium with these three notes that you hear at the beginning of the film.I sent the theme to Edward Berger — which is something you don't normally do, you don't send the first idea to the director, you collect maybe 10-15 ideas first so you're sure one of them might work. But in this case, I decided to send him the first idea right away, because it was so strong and clear to me. I wanted to know if he felt the same way.He called me the next day and was overjoyed: ""Fantastic, this is awesome, we're excited, it's exactly how we want it!"" At that point it was clear to me that I could actually develop everything with that theme in some way.You wrote a very minimalistic, but also expressive and frightening score. How did you decide what the music for this film should be?The first 10 minutes of the film tell the story of the uniform, and for me that was like a collage of images. There's no text, you just see the soldiers slowly leaving for the war. Then the soldiers die. Their uniforms are taken off, they're washed, they are taken to a factory where they are cleaned, and then it's time for the sewing machines to sew new name tags onto the uniforms.For me, that sequence stands for the machinery of war, for how people were like material. And I felt that the music had to fit the war machine, for instance the sewing machines, in some way. The only way to do that was to take short, iconic elements and have them pop up again and again, like an art installation.I also thought about the fact that these five young men who go to war lose everything they dreamed of in a relatively short period of time, everything they actually are as humans. Yet they keep on having these moments, where they might hold a woman's scarf in their hands or see a poster of a woman.In the film, women tend to symbolize what these guys are actually waiting for, where they have a sense of normalcy. That's where there's hope. And I felt like it needed a religious theme to go with the powerful war machine sound.The main three-note theme that runs throughout the film was played on your great-grandmother's harmonium. What is the story behind that?I got a call from my hometown more than a year ago about a harmonium which belonged to my family. I checked out the instrument and immediately said, ""I want that.""In Düsseldorf, where I live now, there is a gentleman who restores harmoniums. I called him and asked if he could restore it. It then stood in my studio, ready and waiting to be used at some point.After that first screening in Berlin, I thought it would be great to score the film with an instrument that dates back to that era, and that also works like a machine. I saw the harmonium and immediately figured that might do the trick, it has a bellows, it has air, you hear the wood when you work on it.I played the first notes, I put it through a distortion and through amplifiers, and that made it so dynamic and powerful that you hear it, but you can't tell for sure what kind of instrument it is.What was the most difficult thing for you when working on the music for this film?What was most difficult was actually not to put too much pathos and too much heroism into the music. As a composer, of course, this is a story where you tend to write sad, melancholic melodies. It was very important to keep a distance and appeal to the emotions at the same time.Seven BAFTA nominations and nine Oscar nominations — what could be the reasons for such great international recognition?I think it's because people can form their own picture of what's being portrayed. And of course current events certainly played a role as well. It could just as easily have been the other way around, that people would have said they didn't want to see a film about war — but it seemed that the film resonated. The current times, the strong script and the strong execution are also part of it. I think that combination led to the vast majority choosing to honor the film.This is a translation of the interview conducted by Marina Baranovska in German.It was updated on March 13 following the Oscars ceremony.",2023/03/13,,

In some recent polls, Lai is not only a frontrunner for the party primary, but also in the general presidential election.Lai has recently received public support from both current Premier Chen Chien-jen (陳建仁) and former Premier Su Tsen-chang (蘇貞昌), but has yet to receive a public endorsement from President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文). Many election watchers are waiting to see if Lai's candidacy can unite factions within the party.Registration for the DPP's presidential primary began Monday morning (March 13) and ends Friday afternoon (March 17). The registration fee is NT$4 million (US$120,000) with a refundable polling fee of NT$1 million (US$30,000), putting the total bill for primary hopefuls at NT$5 million (US$150,000).Insiders within Lai’s camp revealed his intention of visiting the DPP Central Standing Committee on Wednesday to register for the primary, per New Talk. Prior to this visit, Lai was spotted having dinner with DPP legislators representing various factions.At a press conference held recently at the Presidential Office, Tsai affirmed that Lai was a good candidate for president, noting he was an experienced and seasoned politician.This sentiment was shared by others loyal to Tsai. ""As long as the nomination team confirms it’s Lai or another candidate, most probably Lai, and as soon as the president calls us into action, we will fully mobilize without any hesitation,"" said Chen Shih-chung (陳時中), honorary chairman of the Tsai Ing-wen Club (小英之友會).",2023/03/13,511,Politics
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833444,"Michelle Yeoh's mom tearful, proud of 'little princess'","KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) — Michelle Yeoh’s mother cried for joy for her “little princess” when the Malaysian performer became the first Asian to win the best actress Oscar.Yeoh’s family and two Cabinet ministers were among the supporters roaring with joy at Yeoh's win during a special Academy Awards viewing party in Malaysia on Monday morning. Her trophy for her performance as a laundromat owner was one of seven Oscars for “Everything Everywhere All at Once,” including best picture.Janet Yeoh, 84, praised the actor as intelligent and hardworking and a filial daughter.“I so love my daughter and she has made Malaysia proud,” Yeoh told a news conference after the viewing at a cinema in Kuala Lumpur. ""Malaysia Boleh (Malaysia Can)!”Janet Yeoh said she was immensely proud of “my little princess,” who wanted to be a ballerina before entering the movie world. Yeoh said she pushed her daughter out of her cocoon despite protests from her late husband, a lawyer whom she described as “old-fashioned.”In her acceptance speech, Yeoh dedicated her award to her mother and said “all the moms in the world” were the real superheroes.Shortly after, Yeoh made a video call to her mom, holding up her trophy in triumph.“It was such a jaw-dropping moment. I was speechless, I cried,” said Vicki Yeoh, Michelle Yeoh's niece, who was at the special viewing. “The nominees are really strong, but we had no doubt. We keep telling her that you will win … you will stand on the stage with the golden man.”Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said Malaysia's government joined the nation to congratulate Yeoh for creating history.“Coupled with this achievement, Michelle’s illustrious and exemplary career in this field will certainly continue to be a source of great inspiration and motivation to our homegrown actors and actresses and provide even greater impetus to the growth of our local industry,” Anwar said in a statement. “Way to go, Michelle!”Sports Minister Hannah Yeoh, who was at the viewing, immediately posted on social media: “Most inspiring quote for all of us aunties - ‘Ladies, don’t let anybody ever tell you that you are past your prime’ - Michelle Yeoh.”Lawmakers Sim Tze Sin and Wee Ka Siong thanked Michelle Yeoh for “breaking glass ceilings"" for Asian and Malaysian women. They praised her for being an icon for resilience and perseverance.Michelle Yeoh, 60, learned ballet before turning to acting. Her first major Hollywood role was playing a Chinese spy in the Bond film “Tomorrow Never Dies” in 1997 alongside Pierce Brosnan.She gained renown for her role in the 2000 martial arts masterpiece “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" a best-picture nominee that won the Oscar for best foreign language film.Yeoh had more recent success in the 2018 movie “Crazy Rich Asians” and Marvel's “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" in 2021.“We are incredibly proud.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833446,"Russia's economy holds up, but growing challenges test Putin","Western sanctions have hit Russian banks, wealthy individuals and technology imports. But after a year of far-reaching restrictions aimed at degrading Moscow’s war chest, economic life for ordinary Russians doesn’t look all that different than it did before the invasion of Ukraine.There’s no mass unemployment, no plunging currency, no lines in front of failing banks. The assortment at the supermarket is little changed, with international brands still available or local substitutes taking their place.Crowds might have thinned at some Moscow malls, but not drastically. Some foreign companies like McDonald’s and Starbucks have been taken over by local owners who slapped different names on essentially the same menu.“Economically, nothing has changed,” said Vladimir Zharov, 53, who works in television. ""I work as I used to work, I go shopping as I used to. Well, maybe the prices have risen a little bit, but not in such a way that it is very noticeable.”Russia’s economy has weathered the West's unprecedented economic sanctions far better than expected. But with restrictions finally tightening on the Kremlin’s chief moneymaker — oil — the months ahead will be an even tougher test of President Vladimir Putin’s fortress economy.Economists say sanctions on Russian fossil fuels only now taking full effect — such as a price cap on oil — should eat into earnings that fund the military's attacks on Ukraine. Some analysts predict signs of trouble — strained government finances or a sinking currency — could emerge in the coming months.But other economists say the Kremlin has significant reserves of money that haven’t been hit by sanctions, while links to new trade partners in Asia have quickly taken shape. They say Russia isn’t likely to run out of money this year but instead will face a slow slide into years of economic stagnation.“It will have enough money under any kind of reasonable scenario,” Chris Weafer, CEO and Russian economy analyst at the consulting firm Macro-Advisory, said in a recent online discussion held by bne IntelliNews.Russia will keep bringing in oil income, even at lower prices, so ""there is no pressure on the Kremlin today to end this conflict because of economic pressures,” he said.As the economy teeters between sanctions and resilience, what everyday Russians can buy has stayed remarkably the same.Apple has stopped selling products in Russia, but Wildberries, the country’s biggest online retailer, offers the iPhone 14 for about the same price as in Europe. Online retailer Svaznoy lists Apple AirPods Pro.Furniture and home goods remaining after IKEA exited Russia are being sold off on the Yandex website. Nespresso coffee capsules have run short after Swiss-based Nestle stopped shipping them, but knockoffs are available.Labels on cans of Budweiser and Leffe beer on sale in Moscow indicate they were brewed by ABInBev’s local partner — even though the company wrote off a stake in its Russian joint venture and put it up for sale. Coke bottled in Poland is still available; local “colas,"" too.ABInBev says it’s no longer getting money from the venture and that Leffe production has been halted. Wildberries and Svyaznoy didn’t answer emails asking about their sourcing.But it’s clear goods are skirting sanctions through imports from third countries that aren’t penalizing Russia. For example, Armenia’s exports to Russia jumped 49% in the first half of 2022. Chinese smartphones and vehicles are increasingly available.The auto industry is facing bigger hurdles to adapt. Western automakers, including Renault, Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz, have halted production, with sales plunging 63% and local entities taking over some factories and bidding for others.Foreign cars are still available but far fewer of them and for higher prices, said Andrei Olkhovsky, CEO of Avtodom, which has 36 dealerships in Moscow, St. Petersburg and Krasnodar.“Shipments of the Porsche brand, as for those of other manufacturers, aren't possible through official channels,” he said. “Whatever is on the market is scattered offerings of cars that were imported by individual persons or through friendly countries by official channels.”Unlike European automakers, some corporations are far from bailing.While 191 foreign companies have left Russia and 1,169 are working to do so, some 1,223 are staying and 496 are taking a wait-and-see approach, according to a database compiled by the Kyiv School of Economics.Companies are facing public pressure from Kyiv and Washington, but some have found it's not so easy to line up a Russian buyer or say they're selling essentials like food.Moscow residents, meanwhile, have downplayed the impact of sanctions.“Maybe it hasn’t affected me yet,"" 63-year-old retiree Alexander Yeryomenko said. ""I think that we will endure everything.”Dmitry, a 33-year-old who declined to give his last name, said only clothing brands had changed.“We have had even worse periods of time in history, and we coped,"" he said, but added that ""we need to develop our own production and not to depend on the import of products.""One big reason for Russia’s resilience: record fossil fuel earnings of $325 billion last year as prices spiked. The surging costs stemmed from fears that the war would mean a severe loss of energy from the world's third-largest oil producer.That revenue, coupled with a collapse in what Russia could import because of sanctions, pushed the country into a record trade surplus — meaning what Russia earned from sales to other countries far outweighed its purchases abroad.The boon helped bolster the ruble after a temporary post-invasion crash and provided cash for government spending on pensions, salaries and — above all — the military.The Kremlin already had taken steps to sanctions-proof the economy after facing some penalties for annexing Ukraine's Crimea peninsula in 2014. Companies began sourcing parts and food at home and the government built up huge piles of cash from selling oil and natural gas. About half of that money has been frozen, however, because it was held overseas.Those measures helped blunt predictions of a 11% to 15% collapse in economic output. The economy shrank 2.1% last year, Russia's statistics agency said. The International Monetary Fund predicts 0.3% growth this year — not great, but hardly disastrous.The big change could come from new energy penalties. The Group of Seven major democracies had avoided wide-ranging sanctions against Russian oil for fear of sending energy prices higher and fueling inflation.The solution was a $60-per-barrel price cap on Russian oil heading to countries like China, India and Turkey, which took effect in December. Then came a similiar cap and European embargo on Moscow's diesel fuel and other refined oil products last month.Estimates differ on how hard those measures will hit. Experts at the Kyiv School of Economics say Russia’s economy will face a “turning point” this year as oil and gas revenue falls by 50% and the trade surplus plunges to $80 billion from $257 billion last year.They say it's already happening: Oil tax revenue fell 48% in January from a year earlier, according to the International Energy Agency.Other economists are skeptical of a breaking point this year.Moscow could likely weather even a short-term plunge in oil earnings, said Janis Kluge, a Russian economy expert at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs.Even cutting Russian oil revenue by a third ""would be a severe hit to GDP, but it would not bankrupt the state and it would not lead to a crash,"" he said. ""I think from now on, we are talking about gradual changes to the economy.”He said the real impact will be long term. The loss of Western technology such as advanced computer chips means an economy permanently stuck in low gear.Russia may have successfully restarted factories after the Western exodus, “but the business case for producing something sophisticated in Russia is gone, and it’s not coming back,” Kluge said.",2023/03/13,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833448,Ruth E. Carter becomes 1st Black woman to win 2 Oscars,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Ruth E. Carter made history: The costume designer behind the “Black Panther” films became the first Black woman to win two Oscars.Carter took home best costume design Sunday night at the 95th Academy Awards for the Marvel sequel “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.” Carter also won in 2018 for “Black Panther,” which made her the first African American to win in the category.In her acceptance speech, Carter thanked the film's director Ryan Coogler and asked if “Black Panther” star Chadwick Boseman could look after her mother, Mabel Carter, who she said died “this past week.” Boseman died in 2020 of cancer at 43.“This is for my mother. She was 101,” Carter said. ""This film prepared me for this moment. Chadwick, please take care of mom.”Carter then paid tribute to her mother backstage.“I had a great relationship with her in her final years. The same relationship I always had with her. I was her ride-or-die. I was her road dog. I was her sidekick,"" she said. ""I know she’s proud of me. I know that she wanted this for me as much as I wanted it for myself.”“Black Panther: Wakanda Forever” grappled with the grief of losing Boseman, its superhero.In her career, Carter has been behind-the-scenes in some of Hollywood’s biggest films. She’s received Oscar nominations for her work in Spike Lee’s “Malcolm X” and Steven Spielberg’s “Amistad” and received praise for her period ensembles in other projects such as Lee Daniels’ “The Butler,” Ava DuVernay’s “Selma” and the reboot of “ROOTS.” She’s created costumes for Oprah Winfrey, Denzel Washington, Eddie Murphy and even Jerry Seinfeld for the “Seinfeld” pilot.Carter played an influential role as lead costume designer in making “Black Panther” a cultural phenomenon as she infused the pride of African diaspora into the character’s stylish and colorful garments to help bring Wakanda to life. She wanted to transform the presence of Queen Ramonda - played by Oscar nominee Angela Bassett — as a queen in the first film to being a ruler in the sequel.""Angela always wanted to play a queen, so to amplify her, we added vibranium … we gave her the royal color of purple, and adorned her in gold as she wore the crown at the UN,” Carter said. “When she sits on the throne, she’s in a gray one shouldered dress. The exposed shoulder shows her strength — Angela, she got those guns, right?”Carter said she was able to pull off the win against a “tough lineup.” She was up against designers from “Elvis,” “Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris,” “Everything Everywhere All at Once,” and “Babylon.”She got her start in 1988 on Lee’s “School Daze,” the director’s second film. They’ve since collaborated on more than 10 films, including “Do the Right Thing” and “Jungle Fever.” She’s also worked with Robert Townsend on “The Five Heartbeats” and Keenen Ivory Wayans on “I’m Gonna Git You Sucka.”“I pulled myself up from my bootstraps,"" Carter said. ""I started in a single parent household. I wanted to be a costume designer. I studied. I scraped. I struggled with adversity in an industry that sometimes didn’t look like me. And I endured.”Through the Oscar-nominated “Malcolm X,"" she reached new heights. That film, starring Denzel Washington, propelled her into the “Hollywood makeup,” offering her more opportunities to work with directors who had different points-of-views and scripts.Carter's wish is that her historic win Sunday will offer more opportunities to women of color.“I hope this opens the door for others … that they can win an Oscar, too,” Carter said.___ For more coverage of this year’s Oscars, visit: https://apnews.com/hub/academy-awards",2023/03/13,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833449,"Nobel laureate Kenzaburo Oe, writer of poetic fiction, dies","TOKYO (AP) — Nobel literature laureate Kenzaburo Oe, whose darkly poetic novels were built from his childhood memories during Japan’s postwar occupation and from being the parent of a disabled son, has died. He was 88.Oe, who was also an outspoken anti-nuclear and peace activist, died on March 3, his publisher, Kodansha Ltd., said in a statement Monday. The publisher did not give further details about his death and said his funeral was held by his family.Oe in 1994 became the second Japanese author awarded the Nobel Prize in literature.The Swedish Academy cited the author for his works of fiction, in which “poetic force creates an imagined world where life and myth condense to form a disconcerting picture of the human predicament today.”His most searing works were influenced by the birth of Oe’s mentally disabled son in 1963.“A Personal Matter,” published a year later, is the story of a father coming to terms through darkness and pain with the birth of a brain-damaged son. Several of his later works have a damaged or deformed child with symbolic significance, with the stories and characters evolving and maturing as Oe’s son aged.Hikari Oe had a cranial deformity at birth that caused mental disability. He has a limited ability to speak and read but has become a musical composer whose works have been performed and recorded on albums.The only other Japanese to win a Nobel in literature was Yasunari Kawabata in 1968.Despite the outpouring of national pride over Oe’s win, his principal literary themes evoke deep unease here. A boy of 10 when World War II ended, Oe came of age during the American occupation.“The humiliation took a firm grip on him and has colored much of his work. He himself describes his writing as a way of exorcising demons,” the Swedish Academy said.Childhood wartime memories strongly colored the story that marked Oe’s literary debut, “The Catch,” about a rural boy’s experiences with an American pilot shot down over his village. Published in 1958, when Oe was still a university student, the story won Japan’s prestigious Akutagawa prize for new writers.He also wrote nonfiction books about Hiroshima's devastation and rise from the Aug. 6, 1945, U.S. atomic bombing, as well as about Okinawa and its postwar U.S. occupation.Oe has campaigned for peace and anti-nuclear causes, particularly since the 2011 Fukushima crisis, and has often appeared in rallies.In 2015, Oe criticized Japan's decision to restart nuclear reactors in the wake of the earthquake and tsunami-triggered meltdown at the Fukushima plant, calling it a risk that could lead to another disaster. He urged then-Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to follow Germany’s example and phase out atomic energy.“Japanese politicians are not trying to change the situation but only keeping the status quo even after this massive nuclear accident, and even if we all know that yet another accident would simply wipe out Japan’s future,” Oe said.Oe, who was 80 then, said his life’s final work is to strive for a nuclear-free world: “We must not leave the problem of nuclear plants for the younger generation.""The third of seven children, Oe was born on Jan. 31, 1935, in a village on Japan’s southern island of Shikoku. At the University of Tokyo, he studied French literature and began writing plays.The academy noted that Oe’s work has been strongly influenced by Western writers, including Dante, Poe, Rabelais, Balzac, Eliot and Sartre.But even with those influences, Oe brought an Asian sensibility to bear.In 2021, thousands of pages of his handwritten manuscripts and other works were sent to be archived at the University of Tokyo.",2023/03/14,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833451,New Zealand beats Sri Lanka on last ball of 1st cricket test,"WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — Kane Williamson and Neil Wagner stole a bye from the last ball of the first cricket test Monday to beat Sri Lanka by two wickets and emphasize New Zealand’s aptitude for extraordinary test match victories.Only two weeks after New Zealand beat England by a single run at the Basin Reserve, the Black Caps again played a part in one of the most incredible finishes in test match history.Rain seemed to have wrecked the final day of the match in Christchurch when it prevented play in the scheduled first two sessions. When it cleared the umpires announced a single extended session in which New Zealand needed 257 runs to win and Sri Lanka needed nine wickets.A winning result seemed impossible though the session was extended to at least 52 overs and more than 3-1/2 hours. In what turned into a 50-overs match, then a 20-overs match, Williamson made an unbeaten 121 to guide New Zealand to a narrow victory.A limpid rainbow hung over Hagley Park as the players came out in the late afternoon to play out the last chapter of an absorbing match. The Sri Lanka fielders were shielding their eyes against the setting sun as the last overs were bowled and darkness engulfed the ground just as the players left the field.New Zealand needed 131 runs off the last 20 overs, then 101 off the last 15 with Williamson steering the innings.Williamson had support from Daryl Mitchell, who made 102 in the first innings and produced another crucial innings of 81 on Monday, accelerating New Zealand's scoring rate. When he was out New Zealand still needed 53 to win.Asitha Fernando bowled superbly through more than the last hour, removing Mitchell with a magnificent yorker. He then dismissed Tom Blundell with 47 to win and Michael Bracewell with 19 required.Finally eight runs were needed off the last over with Williamson in charge.One run came from the first ball bowled by Asitha, one run from the second and then Matt Henry was run out and the drama increased.Neil Wagner, the hero of New Zealand’s win over England, had been supposed to be ruled out of the match and the next test with a bulging disc in his back and a hamstring strain. But he couldn’t resist the drama of the moment, discharging himself from the spinal unit of a local hospital and jogging to the crease with five runs needed and three balls remaining.Williamson struck a boundary and there was one run needed off two balls. The next ball from Asitha was short, it passed over Williamson’s head as he stood upright but no wide was called.That left the equation as one ball remaining, one run needed.Williamson played at but missed another short ball and ran through, arriving as the stumps were shattered by a Sri Lanka throw at the non-striker's end. The final and crucial decision was left to the video umpire. He considered the footage and decided Williamson had made his ground and New Zealand had won by two wickets with no time to spare.New Zealand's winning run chase was it's third-largest in test cricket.“When it came to that last run I just had to put my head down and go,” Wagner said. ""Kane was going. I thought of going the previous ball but I knew Kane was the man to do the job.“Exceptional from Kane and Daryl and all the guys. An extraordinary team performance. One of the characteristics of this team is that we keep fighting and try to stay in the contest.”Monday was Wagner's 37th birthday.Defeat cost Sri Lanka the chance of a place in the final of the World Test Championship, securing instead India's place against Australia in June.“Unfortunately we were on the losing side but I think it was a pretty good game,” Sri Lanka captain Dimuth Karunaratne said. “It’s disappointing for us but if you take the positives out I think we’ve done really, really well and done a good job in this championship.”The first test had been absorbing and the complexion of the match changed at times hour by hour in Christchurch. It contained two centuries, numerous half centuries, a five-wicket haul to Tim Southee and it saw some of the chess-like tactical moves of good cricket.New Zealand captain Tim Southee saw a green pitch on the first day and sent Sri Lanka in. By the end of the day after half centuries to Kusal Mendis and Dimuth Karunaratne, Sri Lanka had 300 runs on the board and the upper hand.Southee’s five-for helped New Zealand end Sri Lanka’s first innings at 355 in a solid start to the second day. But the home team then slumped to 151-5 and the prospects of a first innings lead looked faint.Once again the lower order came to New Zealand’s rescue. Mitchell made 102 and seamer Matt Henry made 72 from 75 balls as New Zealand achieved an improbable first innings lead.Veteran Angelo Mathews made 115 before Sri Lanka was all out for 302 in its second innings, an overall lead of 284.That left the game in a fascinating balance and created the possibility of a magnificent finish on the final day.___More AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/13,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833453,Asian shares extend losses as US banking worries persist,"TOKYO (AP) — Asian shares declined Tuesday, as investors around the world watched to see what's next following the second- and third-largest bank failures in U.S. history.In Asia, direct exposure to the risks from the U.S. failures seemed slim, at least so far. Still, fears of contagion persisted, sending regional benchmarks lower across the region.Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 dropped nearly 2.0% to 27,286.87, extending losses from the day before. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 dipped 1.6% to 6,992.00. South Korea's Kospi fell 1.9% to 2,365.18. Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell 1.2% to 19,462.84. The Shanghai Composite declined 0.7% to 3,245.13.“There is escalating tension in the global financial world; this is despite non-U.S. banks’ exposure to US regional banks being minimal, with the global systems being well capitalized and flush with liquidity,” Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management, said in a report.“U.S. financial stress could lead banks of all stripes to retrench lending to the real economy and tighten broader financial conditions, amplifying risk to the broader markets.”On Monday, Japan's chief government spokesman, Hirokazu Matsuno, told reporters that the impact on Japanese banks would likely be limited.However, bank shares fell sharply Tuesday. MUFG fell 6.3%, Mizuho Financial Group sank 5.8% and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group’s shares dropped 6.2%.The biggest price decline so far on Wall Street this week appeared to be with banks. Other stocks rose on hopes the bloodletting will force the U.S. Federal Reserve to take it easier on the hikes to interest rates that are shaking Wall Street and the economy.Investors are worried that a relentless rise in interest rates meant to get inflation under control are approaching a tipping point and may be cracking the banking system.On Wall Street, the S&P 500 dipped 0.2% to 3,855.76 after whipsaw trading, where it careened from an early loss of 1.4% to a midday gain of nearly that much. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3% to 31,819.14, while the Nasdaq composite rose 0.4% to 11,188.84.The U.S. government announced a plan late Sunday meant to shore up confidence in the banking industry following the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank since Friday.The heaviest pressure is on the regional banks a couple steps below in size of the massive, “too-big-to-fail” banks that foundered in 2007 and 2008. Shares of First Republic Bank fell 61.8%, even after the bank said Sunday it had strengthened its finances with cash from the Federal Reserve and JPMorgan Chase.Huge banks, which have been repeatedly stress-tested by regulators following the 2008 financial crisis, weren't down as much. JPMorgan Chase fell 1.8%, and Bank of America dropped 5.8%.Some investors are calling for the Fed to make cuts to interest rates soon to stanch the bleeding. Rate cuts often act like steroids for the stock market. The wider expectation, though, is that the Fed will likely pause or at least hold off on accelerating its rate hikes at its next meeting later this month.That would still be a sharp turnaround from expectations just a week ago, when many traders were forecasting the Fed could go back to increasing the size of its rate hikes to tame stubbornly high inflation.Now, ""depending on reactions in financial markets and eventual fallout on the overall economy, we wouldn’t rule out that the hiking cycle could even be over and that the next move by Fed officials may be lower not higher,” said Kevin Cummins, chief U.S. economist at NatWest.Higher interest rates can drag down inflation by slowing the economy, but they raise the risk of a recession later on. They also hit prices for stocks, as well as bonds sitting in investors' portfolios.Prices for Treasurys shot higher as investors sought safety and as their expectations grew for an easier Fed. That in turn sent their yields lower, The yield on the 10-year Treasury was steady at 3.56%, down from 3.70% late Friday. That’s a major move for the bond market.The two-year yield, which moves more on expectations for the Fed, fell to 3.99% from 4.59% Friday. It was above 5% earlier this month.In energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude lost 35 cents to $74.45 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It fell $1.88 to $74.80 a barrel on Monday.Brent crude, the international standard, lost 90 cents to $79.87 a barrel.In currency trading, the U.S. dollar rose to 133.69 Japanese yen from 133.20 yen.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833454,Government races to reassure US that banking system is safe,"NEW YORK (AP) — Depositors withdrew savings and investors broadly sold off bank shares Monday as the federal government raced to reassure Americans that the banking system was secure after two bank failures fed fears that more financial institutions could fall.President Joe Biden insisted that the system was safe after the second- and third-largest bank failures in the nation's history happened in the span of 48 hours. In response to the crisis, regulators guaranteed all deposits at the two banks and created a program that effectively threw a lifeline to other banks to shield them from a run on deposits.“Your deposits will be there when you need them,” Biden told the public, seeking to project calm. He also said the banking executives responsible for the failures would be held accountable.In other developments, the Federal Reserve announced that it would reassess its supervision of Silicon Valley Bank.“We need to have humility and conduct a careful and thorough review of how we supervised and regulated this firm, and what we should learn from this experience,” said Michael Barr, the Fed’s vice chair for supervision, who will lead the effort.Regulators closed the bank Friday after depositors rushed to withdraw their funds all at once. The only larger failure in U.S. banking history was the 2008 collapse of Washington Mutual. New York-based Signature Bank was seized by regulators late Sunday in third-largest failure in the U.S.In both cases, the government agreed to cover deposits, even those that exceeded the federally insured limit of $250,000.Despite the message from the White House, investors broadly dumped shares in bank stocks. Shares of First Republic Bank closed down more than 60% even after the bank said it was taking emergency funding from the Federal Reserve and additional money from JPMorgan Chase.Shares in KeyCorp and Comerica plunged by nearly a third. The stock of well-known franchises such as Charles Schwab, Fifth Third Bank, Truist and Huntington Bancshares all dropped by double digits.The selloff happened in part because the country woke up to a new banking system and investors had to find the winners and losers, banking experts said.There was no guarantee that the anxiety would not spread. Customers at other banks with deposits over the $250,000 limit remained at risk of losing access to their money for a time.Just because the government covered for Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank ""doesn’t mean they are going to cover for these smaller banks,” said Chris Caulfield, a senior partner at West Monroe.In Asia, direct exposure to the risks from the U.S. failures seemed slim, at least so far. Hirokazu Matsuno, the Japanese government spokesman, told reporters a major ripple effect to the Japanese financial system was unlikely. But fears sent regional benchmarks lower in morning trading.Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 dropped 1.7%, extending losses from the day before. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 dipped 2.1%, and South Korea’s Kospi fell 0.9%. The Shanghai Composite index lost 0.7%, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was down 1%.Wesley Zheng, co-founder and CEO of Posh Robotics, which is working to develop sustainable batteries, said he will move $4 million from Silicon Valley Bank to JPMorgan Chase.“No more small banks. We have so many other things we’re working on, we don’t want to be worried about figuring out the risk management of the banks we’re working with,"" he said.Further, the government's actions suggested it would stand behind all deposits if doing so prevents damage to the broader economy.“Everything is now covered. That’s a fact. No matter how specialized or isolated your bank is, if there’s a risk of contagion, regulators have made it clear that they are going to intervene,” said Norbert Michel, a banking policy expert at the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute.Amid the selloff of midsize banks, investors kept relatively calm over the health of the nation’s biggest banking bulwarks, such as Citigroup, Bank of America and Wells Fargo. Investors apparently concluded that the only place to be safe in banking was with the nation’s most strictly regulated institutions.Notably, shares in JPMorgan Chase — the nation's biggest bank with more than $3 trillion in assets — fell a modest 1.8% on Monday.Regional banks were seen as the riskiest, since they do not have the scale to compete against larger competitors. Large account balances — once seen as a positive sign that a bank's clients are well off — were a liability since they could be withdrawn at the first sign of trouble.“I wouldn’t want to be running a regional bank right now where my services are no different from my competition,” Caulfield said.International regulators also had to step in to ease fears. The Bank of England and U.K. Treasury said they facilitated the sale of a Silicon Valley Bank subsidiary in London to HSBC, Europe’s biggest bank. The deal protected 6.7 billion pounds ($8.1 billion) of deposits.Under the plan announced by U.S. regulators, depositors at Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank were able to access their money. A new Fed program will allow banks to post certain high-quality securities as collateral and borrow from a government emergency fund.The Treasury has set aside $25 billion to offset any losses. However, Fed officials said they do not expect to have to use that money, given that the securities posted as collateral have a very low risk of default.New York bank regulators took possession of Signature Bank on Sunday, ousting its leaders and handing day-to-day control over to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said the decision by the state Department of Financial Services was aimed at holding off a bigger crisis involving more banks.“Our view was to make sure that the entire banking community here in New York was stable, that we can project calm,” Hochul said Monday at a news conference.She said a high volume of withdrawals that began last week continued with online transactions through the weekend. The bank was open Monday under the name of Signature Bridge Bank.Signature, which was founded more than two decades ago, has about 40 offices across the country and says it focuses on banking for privately owned businesses, their owners and senior managers.Though Sunday’s steps marked the most extensive government intervention in the banking system since the 2008 financial crisis, the actions were relatively limited compared with 15 years ago.The two failed banks themselves have not been rescued, and taxpayer money has not been provided to them.Michele Barry, a teacher who was at Silicon Valley Bank on Monday, said members of the FDIC and bank employees were available to answer questions.Barry, who also runs an after-school program for children, wanted to make sure that her four employees would be paid. She was told that all checks from Friday would be honored, along with her automatic payments.Barry left enough in her account to cover the payments, but she transferred the bulk of her money over to another bank. She said Biden’s reassurance was helpful.“I’m from South Africa. Chances are if this happened in South Africa, nobody would insure your money,” she said.___ Rugaber and Megerian reported from Washington. Sweet and Bussewitz reported from New York.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833455,China's Xi wants bigger global role after Saudi-Iran deal,"BEJIING (AP) — President Xi Jinping called Monday for China to play a bigger role in managing global affairs after Beijing scored a diplomatic coup as the host of talks that produced an agreement by Saudi Arabia and Iran to reopen diplomatic relations.Xi gave no details of the ruling Communist Party's plans in a speech to China's ceremonial legislature. But Beijing has been increasingly assertive since he took power in 2012 and called for changes in the International Monetary Fund and other entities it says fail to reflect the desires of developing countries.China should “actively participate in the reform and construction of the global governance system” and promote “global security initiatives,” said Xi, the country’s most powerful leader in decades.That will add “positive energy to world peace and development,"" Xi said.On Friday, Xi was named to another term in the ceremonial presidency after breaking with tradition in October and awarding himself a third-five year term as general secretary of the ruling party, putting himself on track to become leader for life.The National People’s Congress on Sunday cemented Xi’s dominance by endorsing the appointment of his loyalists as premier and other government leaders in a once-a-decade change. Xi has sidelined potential rivals and loaded the top ranks of the ruling party with his supporters.The new premier, Li Qiang, tried Monday to reassure entrepreneurs but gave no details of possible plans to improve conditions after Xi's government spent the past decade building up state companies that control banking, energy, steel, telecoms and other industries.Li's comments echoed promises by other Chinese leaders over the past six months to support entrepreneurs who generate jobs and wealth. They have vowed to simplify regulations and taxes but have given no indication they plan to rein in state companies that entrepreneurs complain drain away their profits.The ruling party will “treat enterprises of all types of ownership equally” and “support the development and growth of private enterprises,” Li said.“Our leading cadres at all levels must sincerely care about and serve private enterprises,” he said.Chinese officials earlier indicated anti-monopoly and data security crackdowns that knocked tens of billions of dollars off the stock market value of e-commerce giant Alibaba Group and other tech companies were ending. But entrepreneurs were rattled anew in February when a star banker who played a leading role in tech deals disappeared. Bao Fan's company said he was “cooperating in an investigation” but gave no details.Li said Beijing will make a priority of job creation as it tries to revive economic growth that sank to 3% last year, the second-lowest level in decades. This year's official growth target is “around 5%.""The premier expressed confidence China can cope as its workforce shrinks. The number of potential workers age 15 to 59 has fallen by more than 5% from its 2011 peak, an unusually abrupt decline for a middle-income country.Li said that while China is losing its “demographic dividend” of young workers, better education means it is gaining a “talent dividend.” He said some 15 million people still enter the workforce every year.“Abundant human resources is still China’s outstanding advantage,” he said.Abroad, Beijing also has built on China’s growing heft as the second-largest economy to promote trade and construction initiatives that Washington, Tokyo, Moscow and New Delhi worry will expand its strategic influence at their expanse.Those include the multibillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative to construct ports, railways and other trade-related infrastructure across an arc of countries from the South Pacific through Asia to Africa and Europe. China also is promoting trade and security initiatives.A “Global Security Initiative” issued in February said China is “ready to conduct bilateral and multilateral security cooperation with all countries.” It offered to help African countries resolve disputes and to set up a “new security framework in the Middle East.”Also last month, Beijing called for a cease-fire in Russia's war against Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy welcomed Chinese involvement but said success would require action in addition to words. Beijing has refused to criticize President Vladimir Putin's attack on Ukraine and has accused Western governments of provoking the invasion.Xi's government rattled the United States and Australia in early 2022 when it signed an agreement with the Solomon Islands that would allow Chinese navy ships and security forces to be stationed in the South Pacific nation.The foreign minister, Qin Gang, warned Washington last week of possible ""conflict and confrontation” if the United States doesn't change course in relations that have been strained by conflicts over Taiwan, human rights, Hong Kong, security and technology.Xi called Monday for faster technology development and more self-reliance in a speech loaded with nationalistic terms. He referred eight times to “national rejuvenation,” or restoring China to its rightful place as an economic, cultural and political leader.He said that before the ruling party took power in 1949, China was “reduced to a semi-colonial, semi-feudal country, subject to bullying by foreign countries.”“We have finally washed away the national humiliation, and Chinese people are the master of their own destiny,” Xi said. “The Chinese nation has stood up, become rich and is becoming strong.”Xi also called for the country to “unswervingly achieve” the goal of “national reunification,” a reference to Beijing’s claim that Taiwan, the self-ruled island democracy, is part of its territory and is obliged to unite with China, by force if necessary.The president of Micronesia, a group of islands east of the Philippines, in a letter dated March 9 and obtained by The Associated Press, accused China of “political warfare.” David Panuelo said Beijing used spying and bribes in an effort to ensure Micronesia would side with China or stay neutral in a possible conflict with Taiwan.The Chinese foreign ministry denied the allegations.___AP writer Nick Perry in Wellington, New Zealand, contributed.",2023/03/13,,World

This AI platform records and analyzes existing business performance indicators, then compares them to ideal scenarios to offer timely and relevant advice on strategy adjustments, ultimately enhancing operational efficiency and driving business success.   Personalized Intelligent System Brings the Best Customer Service Experience   According to the NGT official information, YOTTA can recommend personalized products or services to target users and customers by using AI technology to analyze their specific preferences. It can also suggest appropriate music, movies, books, and exhibitions based on user favor. Users can use its intelligent search function to access more information. The built-in search engine has been upgraded with AI technology, significantly improving the relevance and accuracy of search results, with faster search speed and more abundant content display. The intelligent customer service system that derives from this mechanism can automatically answer customer questions and provide corresponding technical support after exploring particular situations. Meanwhile, YOTTA continues to learn and enhance its natural language processing (NLP) logic to empower its cognitive, understanding, and abilities to generate, providing users with more reliable and tailored services.

For general industries, AI technology can significantly facilitate or supplant the processing of repetitive and cumbersome mechanical tasks, such as template writing, spreadsheet creation, information collection and organization, data and document classification and management, basic modeling, and programming code writing. YOTTA's language processing model adopts automated chatbots and virtual assistants to handle question-and-answer tasks, which can efficiently reduce customer service costs and improve user experience. In addition, YOTTA's analysis model can be used in the early stage of digital marketing to analyze the consumption emotions of target customers through social media, generate high-quality marketing content, and then carry out personalized push. Nowadays, in the e-commerce-dominated retail and fast-moving consumer goods (FMCGs) markets, using YOTTA's AI models can not only recommend products to consumers but also provide businesses with the greatest benefit of automating inventory management, inventory count and sorting, as well as strengthen fraud monitoring and warning in online transactions.   The launch and trial of YOTTA entirely demonstrate NGT's professionalism and proficiency in developing and delivering cutting-edge AI products and related services. It showcases the core team's deep understanding and adept use of this emerging technology logic.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833545,Taiwan Gender Equality Week tackles STEM gender gap,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwan Gender Equality Week (TGEW) is empowering women in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) to complement the United Nations 67th Session of the Commission on the Status of Women (UN CSW), taking place from March 6-17.

            The Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in New York (TECO-NY) hosted two events, on March 7 and 9, to celebrate the technological wisdom and achievements of women. The events attracted both distinguished speakers and guests, including diplomatic allies, NGOs, and overseas Taiwanese.

            Director-General of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office James K.J. Lee (李光章) said in his opening remarks, “As a global leader in the IT industry, Taiwan is committed to sharing its experience and expertise with international partners.” However, Lee acknowledged that gender discrimination and unjust stereotypes continue to deprive women of reaching their full potential in the tech industry.

            H.E. Deputy Prime Minister of Eswatini Themba Masuku also spoke at the event. Masuku called Taiwan’s exclusion from the U.N. “unfair” and “unjustifiable,” adding “Eswatini will always support Taiwan’s call for readmission as a member of the U.N.”











            “Taiwan Night – Celebrating Women in Tech” on March 7 featured a multiverse fashion show, directed by Taiwanese designer Claudia Wang (王子欣) and was live streamed on YouTube. TECO also organized a seminar titled “Taiwan Main Stage: Promoting Gender Equality in the Digital Age” on March 9, a collaboration between NGOs and the public sector that shared insights and pondered new initiatives to build a more gender-inclusive future.

            Taiwanese panelists included Deputy Minister of Taiwan’s National Science and Technology Council Chern Yi-juang (陳儀莊), Vice Chairperson of the Committee on International Affairs, Taiwan Nurses Association Ko Nai-ying (柯乃熒), and Founder of With Red & Period Museum Vivi Lin (林薇).

            In addition, Taiwan’s NGOs organized 31 parallel events during TGEW, 16 in-person and 15 virtual. The Taiwan Nurses Association (TWNA) will host a discussion called “Gender Equality in the Health Care System in the Digital Age” on March 14. The Garden of Hope Foundation will also co-host three events between March 5-17 that examine how technology affects women’s safety.

            Taiwan ranks first in Asia and sixth in the world in gender equality, according to the Executive Yuan. However, female representation in STEM remains low in Taiwan and the world.

            In many tech companies in Taiwan, the percentage of women in management positions lags behind the national average of 30.5%. For example, in 2020, TSMC, Taiwan’s largest semiconductor company, reported that only 20% of its STEM employees and 12% of its management were female.

            The Gender Equality Committee of the Executive Yuan named several barriers that prevent women from fully participating in the workforce, including gender stereotypes and discrimination, existing childcare policies, unconscious bias, and “traditional values that need to be checked and improved upon.”

            Despite its exclusion from the U.N., Taiwan is committed to promoting gender equality as part of the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals. Increasing gender diversity will enable Taiwan’s tech industry to reach new heights, as well as alleviate Taiwan’s labor shortage.

            The Ministry of Foreign Affairs released its TGEW 2023 video entitled “The Power of Women,” to showcase the ways women are stepping into new fields and making a positive impact amid a new era of advanced technology.TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwan Gender Equality Week (TGEW) is empowering women in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) to complement the United Nations 67th Session of the Commission on the Status of Women (UN CSW), taking place from March 6-17.The Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in New York (TECO-NY) hosted two events, on March 7 and 9, to celebrate the technological wisdom and achievements of women.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833546,"Authorities remove Shinto deity from Taiwan shrine, return to Japan","TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Controversial depictions of a Japanese deity allowed in Taoyuan Martyrs' Shrine and Cultural Park in October have been returned to Japan.The depiction of the Japanese goddess Amaterasu caused an uproar last year when it was allowed into the shrine for a cultural event, leading to accusations that Taoyuan City Government had “abandoned its ancestors” per Storm Media. The deity appeared in the shrine during the former Democratic Progressive Party Mayor Cheng Wen-tsan’s (鄭文燦) time in office, and has been sent back to Japan by his successor, Kuomintang (KMT) Mayor Chang San-cheng (張善政).The Martyr's Shrine complex was built by the Japanese government during the colonial period (1895-1945) as a traditional Shinto shrine, but became the Taoyuan County Martyrs’ Shrine under the Kuomintang, following its takeover of Taiwan in 1949. The shrine is dedicated to soldiers who died in armed conflicts, which were mostly a result of conflict with Japan.KMT legislator for Taoyuan Niu Hsu-ting (牛煦庭) said the previous mayoral administration had not properly considered the potential impact when allowing Japanese deities into the park. “Cheng Wen-tsan’s city government … allowed manufacturers to make decisions about welcoming gods and offering sacrifices based on purely commercial considerations, which lacks sufficient oversight,” he said, posing in Facebook on Monday (March 13).DPP Legislator Huang Chiung-hui (黃瓊慧) responded to Niu’s comments and said that despite the concerns of critics, Amaterasu did not represent war, that the removal was politically motivated, and was without civic merit. “As a native of Taoyuan, I have already learned how to respect and tolerate various multi-ethnic cultures, and ideology is not my first consideration for sightseeing,” she wrote, also on Facebook on Monday.Taoyuan Martyrs' Shrine is one of the best-preserved examples of a Japanese Shinto shrine outside of Japan. Japanese colonial authorities built many shrines in Taiwan during the occupation period, but the majority were destroyed by the KMT government following Japan’s decision to switch diplomatic recognition to China in 1973.",2023/03/13,1281,Politics

The documentary, which is streaming on Netflix, follows the story of a couple in southern India who devote themselves to caring for an orphaned elephant and explores the bond between humans and animals.“Congratulations India” trended on Twitter after “Naatu Naatu” by M.M. Keeravani and Chandrabose trumped the likes of Rihanna and Lady Gaga to win best original song.In the southern Indian city of Hyderabad, where the predominant language is Telugu, fans were elated over the Telugu song’s global triumph. “It’s an incredible feeling. Finally, a Telugu film did it and we have won an Oscar,” rejoiced Venkata Ramanna, a software engineer, who described the win as “exhilarating.""From Indian celebrities and politicians to cricketers and regular citizens, social media in India was awash with congratulations.“#NaatuNaatu on top of the world!!!” cheered Chiranjeevi, a prominent Telugu film actor and former politician, on Twitter.“Exceptional! The popularity of ‘Naatu Naatu’ is global,” tweeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi.He also congratulated the female duo behind “The Elephant Whisperers,” director Kartiki Gonsalves and producer Guneet Monga, for highlighting the “importance of sustainable development and living in harmony with nature.""Monga tweeted that the award was “historic” for India and for women: “To all the women watching….The future is audacious and the future is here,” she wrote.Licypriya Kangujam, a young climate activist in India, called the documentary win a proud moment for every environmentalist.But the hashtags Naatu Naatu and RRR dominated social media feeds Monday.The three-hour maximalist action epic is one of India’s most expensive and top-grossing films of all time and pairs two of the country’s biggest stars: N.T. Rama Rao Jr. and Ram Charan.It also quickly climbed U.S. box-office charts before it found an even wider audience on Netflix, where it ranked among the top 10 non-English language films for weeks. The massively popular song also won a Golden Globe award in January.“Naatu Naatu is an emotion across the globe,” Charan posted on Twitter as he congratulated the “RRR” team. “This award belongs to every Indian actor, technician and filmgoer,” he wrote.The song was shot in August 2021 in front of Ukraine's Mariinskyi Palace, the official residence of the president in Kyiv, months before Russia invaded the country. The crew took 15 days to shoot the music video, which featured around 50 dancers and up to 400 extras.In an interview with Variety in January, director S.S. Rajamouli said he wanted to explore the movie's anti-colonial themes in the song through an action sequence that saw the film's two main Indian actors out-dance the British. He said he wanted choreography “that would look great with two people doing it together, but not so complicated that no-one could do it.""The fast-paced dance steps quickly went viral, sparking a TikTok challenge where users attempted to recreate the acrobatic moves. The catchy tempo became an internet sensation, having racked up more than 122 million views on YouTube.Backstage at the awards ceremony, Keeravani was emotional about the win. “It's just the beginning of everything,” he said. “For the world, particularly the Western world, folks are more on India and Asian music. It’s just long due. I feel very happy to open doors and the world to embrace my culture.”___See more AP Academy Awards coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/academy-awards",2023/03/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833558,Flights at several German airports disrupted by 1-day strike,"BERLIN (AP) — Flights at several German airports were severely disrupted on Monday by the latest in a string of one-day strikes related to various pay disputes.The ver.di union called workers out on “warning strikes” at Berlin, Hamburg, Hannover and Bremen airports.Some 200 departures were canceled in Berlin, and about a third of the planned 200 arrivals were expected to be canceled, German news agency dpa reported. Hamburg airport said that all 123 planned departures during the strike were canceled and at least 50 of the 121 planned arrivals.The walkouts by airport staff come amid difficult pay talks for employees of Germany’s federal and municipal governments.Unions are seeking a 10.5% pay raise, while employers so far have offered an increase totaling 5% in two stages and one-time payments of 2,500 euros ($2,630) per employee — which unions have rejected as insufficient. The next round of talks is due to start March 27.There are also negotiations ongoing nationwide over air safety workers' pay and locally for ground service workers.",2023/03/13,,World

Family members heard a single gunshot. They ran into the room and found the small toddler, 4-years-old, unresponsive,” Gonzalez said.The girl was pronounced dead at the scene after police responded to a 911 call by the family, Gonzalez told journalists outside the home.“It just seems like another tragic story of, again, a child gaining access to a firearm and hurting someone else and this time there was a fatal shot,” Gonzalez said.The Harris County District Attorney's Office will decide whether any of the adults will face charges based on the police investigation, which is still in the preliminary phase, Gonzalez said.“Our hearts are broken. Our deputies are pretty shaken up,” Gonzalez said, noting that support personnel would be at the scene to assist the officers and family members.“The community is impacted when a child loses their life in this way,” Gonzalez said, adding that the shooting was another avoidable gun death.“We continue to send the message that this is very preventable,” Gonzalez said. “You've got to be sure you're being a responsible gun owner, securing your weapons in a safe place. It's got to be more than just telling young kids not to touch the weapons. You know, we've got to do a little more. We see far too many tragic situations like this unfold.”",2023/03/13,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833560,Oscar Moments: Moms get special praise on feel-good night,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — It was chaotic, messy, wild, creative, big-hearted and utterly unique. If it were a bagel, it would most certainly have been the “everything” kind.But “Everything Everywhere All At Once” was a movie, not a bagel, and it ruled Sunday's Oscar ceremony, making for one feel-good moment after another — and making history, too, on a huge night for Asians and Asian Americans in Hollywood.And as for The Slap? Well, this Oscar night felt more like a big hug, its heartwarming speeches a potent antidote to the uneasy memory of last year’s Will Smith saga. They kept coming: There was Ke Huy Quan, bounding up the stairs to accept the supporting actor trophy, his teary joy infectious as he referred to his remarkable life story. From the same film there was Jamie Lee Curtis, speaking eloquently about acting as a collaborative endeavor, and the directing duo the Daniels, thanking public school teachers and the family members who nurtured their creativity.Then there was leading lady Michelle Yeoh, putting an overdue cherry on top of her amazing career as she became the first Asian best actress winner. She spoke of many things, but perhaps most eloquently about mothers, whom she called “superheroes.” And on this Oscar night in particular, many winners joined her in thanking their mothers poignantly, none more so than costume designer Ruth E. Carter, who saluted her 101-year-old mother, who she said had just died.Also thanked, of course, were were children, fathers, husbands and wives. “I am your son, and I love you,” Guillermo del Toro, winning for best animated film, said to his late parents. And perhaps the four most heart-rending words of the night came from a wife to a husband: “Stay strong, my love,” said Yulia Navalnaya to her imprisoned husband, Alexei Navalny, the Russian opposition leader.Some of the evening’s top moments:SO, ABOUT LAST YEAR ...Serving once again as host, Jimmy Kimmel was clearly going to have to bring up The Slap, as it shall forever be known. It took about seven minutes into his monologue before he did — a sarcastic crack about the bizarrely passive reaction last year to the moment Will Smith slapped Chris Rock over a joke directed at his wife. “We have strict policies in place,” Kimmel said. “If anyone in this theater commits an act of violence at any point in this show, you will be awarded the Oscar for best actor and permitted to give a 19-minute long speech.” Later, he made a reference to Smith’s performance as Hitch, and at another point referenced one of his songs — all without mentioning his name.QUAN GETS TEARS FLOWING EARLY, AND OFTENEmotions were running high from the second award, as the ebullient Quan won his supporting actor trophy — an outcome that was expected but no less exciting in the moment. In fact, presenter Ariana DeBose could barely utter his name — she was already crying.“My journey started on a boat. I spent a year in a refugee camp,” said Quan, 51, who is of Vietnamese descent. “Somehow, I ended up here on Hollywood’s biggest stage. They say stories like this only happen in the movies. I cannot believe it’s happening to me. This — THIS — is the American dream.” He also thanked — of course — his mother, age 84, watching at home.CURTIS: “I AM HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE”Winning immediately after Quan, Curtis stepped onstage and made yet another terrific awards-season speech about collaborating in the industry. “I know it looks like I am standing up here myself, but I am not,” she said. “I am hundreds of people.”She spoke to all the fans and colleagues who “supported the genre movies I have made all these years, the hundreds and thousands of people: We. Just. Won. An. Oscar. Together!” And Curtis, too, shouted out to her famous late parents, Tony Curtis and Janet Leigh, whom she noted had been nominated in different categories. “I just won an Oscar!” she told them.STAY STRONG, MY LOVENavalny sits in solitary confinement in Russia. So it was left to his wife, Yulia Navalnaya, to speak for him — and to him, as well — when the documentary “Navalny” won an Oscar. “My husband is in prison just for telling the truth. My husband is in prison just for defending democracy,” Navalnaya said. “Alexei, I am dreaming of the day when you will be free and our country will be free. Stay strong, my love.”Director Daniel Roher dedicated his Oscar to Navalny and all political prisoners around the world. “Alexei, the world has not forgotten your vital message to us all: We must not be afraid to oppose dictators and authoritarianism wherever it rears its head.”GAGA GOES MINIMALNo one knows how to step into the glamour better than Lady Gaga, and she appeared on the Oscar red (well, champagne-colored) carpet in dramatic makeup and a fabulous Versace gown from the designer’s recent collection. But when she appeared onstage — in a surprise appearance — to sing a powerful rendition of “Hold My Hand” from “Top Gun: Maverick,” the glamorous outfit was gone, replaced by a T-shirt and ripped jeans and a makeup-free face. It was yet another compelling Oscar performance for Gaga, who never fails to innovate and surprise.CARTER MAKES HISTORY, AGAINFour years ago, Carter took her first historic statuette, becoming the first Black woman to win for costume design for “Black Panther.” On Sunday she again made history when she won the award for “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,” becoming the first Black woman to win two Oscars. She dedicated the award to Mabel Carter, her mother, who she said died this past week at age 101. “This film prepared me for this moment,” she said. “Chadwick, please take care of Mom” — referring to Chadwick Boseman, the beloved late star of the original film.THE DANIELS THANK THE TEACHERS – AND THE MOMMIES!The Daniels — Scheinert and Kwan — had a number of opportunities to ascend the stage, collecting awards for best original screenplay and best director on the way to a best picture win for “Everything Everywhere.” The first time, Scheinert quipped he was going to name all the teachers who put him and his brother in detention — then instead thanked the teachers, by name, who “educated me and inspired me and taught me to be less of a butthead.”Kwan thanked “my Mom who protected me as a child, protected my inner storyteller.” Winning best director, they came back to thank, in Scheinert’s words, “the mommies of the world .... specifically my mom and dad, thank you for not squashing my creativity when I was making really disturbing horror films or really perverted comedy films or dressing in drag as a kid, which is a threat to nobody!” The audience cheered.YEOH IS TAKING IT HOME TO MALAYSIA – AND MOM!In “Everything Everywhere,” one of Yeoh’s most memorable scenes is a reconciliation of sorts with her young adult daughter (Stephanie Hsu ), a scene that speaks to the very essence of parenthood, in all its trials and rewards.So it was fitting that Yeoh, accepting her best actress award, would focus on motherhood as well. “I have to dedicate this to my mom, all the moms in the world because they are really the superheroes,"" she said, “and without them none of us would be here tonight.” She added that her mom was watching in Malaysia with her family. “She’s 84, and I’m taking this home to her.” Yeoh, 60, also earned cheers for her plug for women as they age in Hollywood, telling them: “Don't let anybody tell you you're past your prime!""___For more coverage of this year’s Academy Awards, visit: https://apnews.com/hub/academy-awards",2023/03/13,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833561,10 iconic moments in Pope Francis' first 10 years as pontiff,"VATICAN CITY (AP) — Pope Francis marks the 10th anniversary of his election as pope on Monday. During that decade, several historic occasions, as well as several unplanned events, helped define the contours and priorities of history's first Latin American pontiff. Visits with refugees in Italy and Greece, trips to Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, and the coronavirus pandemic and the death of his predecessor are some of the iconic moments that have shaped his papacy and influenced the direction of the Catholic Church at large.—- July 8, 2013: Francis travels to the southern Italian island of Lampedusa for his first pastoral visit outside Rome to denounce the “globalization of indifference” that greets migrants who risk their lives trying to reach Europe. The plight of refugees would go on to become a major concern of his pontificate, including when he returned from Greece in 2016 with 12 Syrian migrants aboard his plane.July 29, 2013: During his first airborne press conference as pope, Francis is asked about a purportedly gay priest and replies, “Who am I to judge?” His comment while flying home from World Youth Day in Rio de Janeiro signaled a more conciliatory, welcoming tone for LGBTQ Catholics who long felt marginalized by the church.Nov. 29, 2015: Francis starts his yearlong Jubilee of Mercy by opening the holy door of the Bangui cathedral, bringing his message of peace to the conflict-wracked Central African Republic. His emphasis on the church being a merciful “field hospital” of welcome would long outlast the official jubilee year.Feb. 13, 2016: “We are brothers,” Francis says as he becomes the first pope to meet with the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill. The historic meeting in Havana, Cuba, wouldn’t be repeated, as hoped, following Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine.Feb. 4, 2019: Francis signs a document pledging Christian-Muslim cooperation to work for peace with the grand imam of Egypt’s Al-Azhar, the seat of Sunni learning, during the first-ever papal trip to the Arabian Peninsula. The “Human Fraternity” document would go onto become a cornerstone of the pope’s effort to forge better relations with the Muslim world.Oct. 21, 2019: Conservative Catholic activists steal three Amazonian Indigenous statues from a Vatican-area church and throw them in the Tiber River, claiming they were pagan idols. The so-called “Pachamama” stunt during Francis’ synod on the Amazon epitomized the depth of conservative opposition to the pope, which only intensified after he launched a crackdown on the use of the old Latin Mass.Nov. 24, 2019: Standing at the memorial to victims of the U.S. atomic bombing in Hiroshima, Japan, Francis declares that not only the use but the mere possession of nuclear weapons is “immoral.” Francis' position modified the Catholic Church's position, which previously held that nuclear deterrence could be morally acceptable in the interim as long as it was used toward mutual, verifiable nuclear disarmament.March 27, 2020: Francis prays in a hauntingly empty St. Peter’s Square for an end to the coronavirus pandemic on the day that Italy recorded the biggest jump in COVID-19 deaths. “We have realized that we are on the same boat, all of us fragile and disoriented, but at the same time important and needed, all of us now called to row together, each of us in need of comforting each other,” he says.July 26, 2022: On the grounds of a former residential school in Canada, Francis apologizes to Indigenous peoples for the “catastrophic” and “evil” policy of forcibly assimilating Native peoples into Christian society. His Canadian apology tour followed a 2015 mea culpa in Bolivia for the “sins, offenses and crimes” of Europe’s colonial-era conquest of the Americas.Jan. 5, 2023: Francis bids farewell to Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI, presiding over his funeral in St. Peter’s Square and closing out an unprecedented chapter in the history of the 2,000-year-old Catholic Church. Benedict’s 2013 resignation paved the way for Francis’ election, and the two men lived side-by-side in the Vatican for a decade as a retired and reigning pope.",2023/03/13,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833564,Inside the Dolby: What you didn’t see on TV on Oscars night,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — It’s during the commercial breaks that the audience inside the Dolby Theatre really comes to life on Oscar night.The stars will gladly play for the cameras posted in their face during the global broadcast – they are actors after all – but a lot of the time it seems like most would rather just talk to their fellow artists in the room.The breaks may go on for an eternity for people watching the Oscars at home but in the Dolby, they’re never long enough as stars on the main floor abruptly end conversations and rush to take their seats again.The beginning of the show is always a scramble as security, organizers and a booming voice of god all try to coax attendees to their seats in time for the live broadcast start. Some barely made it in, like “The Last of Us” and “The Mandalorian” star Pedro Pascal, whose handler pleaded to let him in because of his appearance in host Jimmy Kimmel’s monologue, while others, like Elizabeth Banks, seem to have been shut out of the opening moments. She was led in the room during the first break, walking past supporting actor nominee Brian Tyree Henry, who had made his way up to Cate Blanchett a few rows ahead.A few minutes later, Henry was one of the first to jump to his feet to cheer for Ke Huy Quan, who won in their category, as Quan’s co-star Michelle Yeoh wiped a tear away from the front row. One person even stood for the end of Quan’s speech: Harry Shum Jr.After his loss, Henry was in good spirits in the lobby. He made his way over to Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Martin McDonagh. He asked for a photo with Waller-Bridge, which McDonagh then dutifully snapped.Back in the room, as Jamie Lee Curtis took the stage to accept her supporting actress prize, Cate Blanchett put her hands over her mouth and made prayer hands toward the newly anointed Oscar winner.Audience members were briefly concerned as what appeared to be smoke billowed up in front of Curtis during her speech. But all breathed a sigh of relief to realize that it was merely a part of the next act, a performance from Sofia Carson.During the next break, Blanchett beelined over to fellow Australian Nicole Kidman to give her a big hug, and Kidman did the same later with Austin Butler.Outside of the theater in the lobby Miles Teller hung by the bar with his wife, while Bill Nighy took a quick bathroom break. And in another part of the room, filmmaker Rian Johnson shared a laugh with Hugh Grant, who made a cameo in his nominated movie “Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery.”The lobby was quite chilly, but at least a few came prepared with layers: Rooney Mara had a red coat to put over her dress and Andrea Riseborough put a black leather jacket over her pale pink gown, which she wore through the end of the ceremony.At the bar, best actor nominee Paul Mescal made some new friends for a few moments. As they debated whether or not they should order tequila, a fan approached Mescal in line to ask for a photo.“Is a selfie ok?” Mescal asked, snapping the pic himself.A few feet away, Mescal's “Aftersun” director Charlotte Wells spent most of the ceremony in the lobby, sipping on a beerIn another corner, Rooney Mara chatted with her “Women Talking” co-star Jessie Buckley. And over on a hard-to-come-by couch, 84-year-old “EO” director Jerzy Skolimowski sat by himself snacking on the popcorn and trail mix available for guests.In the ladies’ room, Yeoh and Sandra Oh were walking arm and arm to exit, while Florence Pugh was a bit delayed. She needed a little help drying her hands in her voluminous dress.“I’m dripping, I’m dripping,” she said with a laugh, her arms extended as far as they could go out in front of her.Moments later at the bar, Pugh sidled up next to Cara Delevingne, both with trains that extended feet behind them, as they whispered to one another. The act of turning around to leave was not as straightforward as they may have anticipated.“To follow each other it takes like ten minutes,” Pugh said.As the night wears on, the lobby gets a bit shinier as more and more winners come out with more and more Oscars in hand, but it also gets a bit less starry as the bigger names of the night make their way back into the room for the final categories.Some, hungry from the long show, took advantage of the “snack boxes” under every seat with a pretzel, a bottle of water and various types of movie theater candy, from Junior Mints to Raisinets.During one of the last breaks, Kerry Condon hugged “Everything Everywhere All At Once” directors Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert as they came back to the room, best original screenplay Oscars in hand, as Michelle Williams stretched her legs a few feet away.Michelle Yeoh was one who didn’t have time to make it back to her seat between winning the best actress award and when Harrison Ford announced that “Everything Everywhere All At Once” had won best picture. So, she emerged from the wings of the stage to join her cast and crew at the microphone for the last award of the night.Many choose to linger in the Dolby Theatre for a bit, but others were eager to move on to the Governors Ball, Vanity Fair and various other gatherings where press and photographers are not invited. For stars on Oscar night, the show is often just the first stop.___For more coverage of this year’s Academy Awards, visit: https://apnews.com/hub/academy-awards.",2023/03/13,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833565,8 dead after smuggling boats capsize off San Diego coast,"SAN DIEGO (AP) — At least eight people were killed when two migrant smuggling boats capsized in shallow but treacherous surf amid heavy fog, authorities said Sunday, marking one of the deadliest maritime human smuggling operations ever off of U.S. shores.A Spanish-speaking woman on one of the panga-style boats called 911 Saturday night to report the other vessel overturned in waves at Black's Beach, authorities said. She said there were 15 people on the capsized vessel and eight on hers.Coast Guard and San Diego Fire-Rescue crews pulled bodies of eight adults from the water, but fog hampered the search for additional victims.Recovery efforts resumed Sunday but no additional bodies were found. The Coast Guard announced on Twitter that the search was suspended at 3:30 p.m.Survivors may have escaped on land, including the woman who called 911. Authorities did not know her whereabouts.San Diego Lifeguard Chief James Gartland said rescuers found the two boats overturned in shallow waters when they arrived. Surf was modest, with swells around 3 feet (1 meter), but skies were foggy and black.“That area is very hazardous, even in the daytime,"" Gartland said at a news conference. ""It has a series of sandbars and in-shore rip currents, so you can think that you can land in some sand or get to waist-high, knee-high water and think that you’re able to be safe to exit the water, but there’s long, in-shore holes. If you step into those holes, those rip currents will pull you along the shore and back out to sea.”Black's Beach is about 15 miles (24 kilometers) north of downtown San Diego in a secluded area not far from the popular La Jolla Shores. Its reputation for some of the best breaks in Southern California draws many surfers.Hundreds of maritime smuggling operations occur every year off California's coast and sometimes turn fatal. In May 2021, a packed boat carrying migrants capsized and broke apart in powerful surf along the rocky San Diego coast, killing three people and injuring more than two dozen others.Smuggling off the California coast has ebbed and flowed over the years but has long been a risky alternative for migrants to avoid heavily guarded land borders. Pangas enter from Mexico in the dead of night, sometimes charting hundreds of miles north. Recreational boats try to mix in unnoticed with fishing and pleasure vessels during the day.South of the U.S. border, there are many secluded, private beaches with gated entrances between high-rises with magnificent ocean views, some only partially built because funds dried up during construction. Popotla, a fishing hamlet where narrow streets are lined with vendors selling a wide variety of local catch, is favored among smugglers for its large, sandy beach and relatively gentle waves.At least some of Saturday's victims were Mexican, according to the consulate in San Diego, but how many was unknown. Illegal crossings have soared under President Joe Biden, with many migrants turning themselves in to Border Patrol agents and being released in the United States to pursue their cases in immigration court.A pandemic rule scheduled to end May 11 denies migrants a chance to seek asylum on grounds of preventing the spread of COVID-19 but enforcement has fallen disproportionately on Mexicans, Hondurans, Guatemalans and El Salvadorans because those have been the only nationalities that Mexico agreed to take back.As a result, people of those four countries have been more likely to try to elude capture, knowing they are likely to be expelled under the public health rule, known as Title 42 authority. Mexico recently began taking back Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans under Title 42.___Associated Press writer Christopher Weber contributed from Los Angeles.",2023/03/13,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833566,What do race and ethnicity mean? The US government is asking,"Nyhiem Way is weary of people conflating African American and Black. Shalini Parekh wants a way for South Asian people to identify themselves differently than East Asians with roots in places like China or Japan. And Byron Haskins wants the U.S. to toss racial and ethnic labels altogether.“When you set up categories that are used to place people in boxes, sometime you miss the truth of them,” said Haskins, who describes himself as African American.Way, Parekh and Haskins' voices are among more than 4,600 comments pending before the Biden administration as it contemplates updating the nation's racial and ethnic categories for the first time since 1997.There's a lot to consider.Some Black Americans want their ancestors' enslavement recognized in how they are identified. Some Jewish people believe their identity should be seen as its own ethnic category and not only a religion. The idea of revising categories for ethnic and racial identities, both in the census and in gathering demographic information between head counts, have fueled editorials and think-tank essays as well as thousands of written comments by individuals in what is almost a Rorschach test for how Americans identify themselves.The White House’s Office of Management and Budget is set to decide on new classifications next year and is hosting three virtual town halls on the subject this week.Some conservatives question the process itself, saying the overarching premise that Americans need more ethnic categories will only accelerate Balkanization.“By creating and deepening sub-national identities, the government further contributes to the decline of one national American identity,” wrote Mike Gonzalez, a senior fellow at The Heritage Foundation, in his personal comment posted on the OMB web page seeking public input.That view contrasts sharply with those who say previous categories have overlooked nuances.“This is certainly a singular moment and opportunity to greatly improve and enhance the accuracy and completeness of the data,"" Mario Beovides, director of policy and legislative affairs for the NALEO Educational Fund, said during a recent forum.The proposed changes would create a new category for people of Middle Eastern and North African descent, also known by the acronym MENA, who are now classified as white but say they have been routinely undercounted.The process also would combine the race and ethnic origin questions into a single query, because some advocates say the current method of asking about race and separately about ethnic origin often confuses Hispanic respondents. With the revisions, the government would try to get more detailed answers on race and ethnicity by asking about country of origin.Another proposal recommends striking from federal government forms the words “Negro” and “Far East,” now widely regarded as pejorative. The terms “majority” and “minority” would also be dropped because some officials say they fail to reflect the nation's complex racial and ethnic diversity.Several Black Americans, like Way, whose ancestors were enslaved, said in public comments to the OMB that they would like to be identified in a category such as American Freedmen, Foundational Black Americans or American Descendants of Slavery to distinguish themselves from Black immigrants, or even white individuals born in Africa, as well as reflecting their ancestors' history in the U.S.Way, who is president of United Sons & Daughters of Freedmen, which describes itself as dedicated to restoring the broken promises from Reconstruction, also recommended substituting the word “population group” for “race.”Conflating “African American” with “Black” has ""blurred what it means to be an African American in this country,” Way, who works for a pharmaceutical company in Athens, Georgia, said in a telephone interview.Haskins, a retired government worker from Lansing, Michigan, suggested eliminating race categories like ""white"" and “Black” since they perpetuate “deeply rooted unjust socio-political constructs.”Instead, he said people should be able to self-identify as they wish. When his sociologist daughter points out the difficulty of aggregating such data into something useful to address inequalities in housing or voting, or tailoring health or education programs to the needs of communities, he tells her, “Go crazy at it. That's what you're being paid for.”“You need to search for the truth and not just stay with the old categories because someone decided, 'That is what we decided,'” Haskins said.Parekh is asking the government to distinguish South Asians from East Asians.“When these groups are assessed together, one loses a lot of important granularity that can help differentiate issues that are specific to one group and not another,” Parekh said.The MENA community appears to be having a related problem, based on several comments to OMB. Without its own category, the group's political power is diluted. People could benefit from cohesive representation, especially if identities were taken into account in drawing political districts, advocates said.It comes down to something even more personal for Houda Meroueh, who described herself to the Biden administration as a 73-year-old Arab American woman.""When I go to the doctor's office I do not feel they have the information necessary to understand my medical history or my culture,"" she said. ""For all these reasons I want to be counted as who I am. Not as white.""Jordan Steiner said ethnic categories should be expanded to include not only MENA, but other groups like Jews who often regard themselves not only as members of a religious group but an ethnic one too.Jessica Aksoy commended the proposals to expand the categories, saying she often felt limited about which boxes to check as someone of Turkish, European and Jewish heritage.“Recognizing our differences is honoring and celebrating the rich melting pot of America,” Aksoy said. “The face of America is changing, and this initiative is for progress in recognizing that.” ___Follow Mike Schneider on Twitter at @MikeSchneiderAP",2023/03/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833567,Iran-Saudi Arabia deal casts China in unfamiliar global role,"BEIJING (AP) — An agreement between Iran and Saudi Arabia to reestablish diplomatic relations has cast China in a leading role in Middle Eastern politics — a part previously reserved for longtime global heavyweights like the U.S. and Russia. It's another sign that China's diplomatic clout is growing to match its economic footprint.Under strongman leader Xi Jinping, Chinese diplomacy has become known for angry outbursts against the West, threats against Taiwan, aggressive moves in the South China Sea and a refusal to condemn Russia over Ukraine.The deal reached in Beijing Friday, under which the sides agreed to reopen their embassies and exchange ambassadors after seven years of tensions, shows a different side of Chinese diplomacy. Xi appears to have played a direct part in the talks by hosting Iran’s president in Beijing last month. He also visited the Saudi capital Riyadh in December for meetings with oil-rich Gulf Arab nations crucial to China’s energy supplies.The agreement was seen as a major diplomatic triumph for China, coming as Gulf Arab states perceive the United States as winding down its involvement in the Middle East.""I think it is a sign that China is increasingly confident in taking a more assertive role in the Middle East,"" said Muhammad Zulfikar Rakhmat, an Indonesian academic affiliated with the Washington-based Middle East Institute.China's economic interests increasingly draw it into conflicts far from its shores. It's by far the biggest customer for Middle Eastern energy exports, while the U.S. has reduced its need for imports as the country shifts toward energy independence.Chinese officials have long argued that Beijing should play a more active role in the region, said June Teufel Dreyer, a political scientist at the University of Miami specializing in Chinese politics.Meanwhile, U.S.-Saudi frictions have created “a vacuum that Beijing was happy to step into,” Dreyer said.China has invested heavily in regional energy infrastructure. It also occasionally contributed naval ships to join anti-piracy operations off the coast of Somalia, though the U.S. Navy has served as the main security guarantor for Mideast waters since the 1980s.In a statement Saturday, China's Foreign Ministry quoted an unidentified spokesperson as saying Beijing “pursues no selfish interest whatsoever.""“China has no intention to and will not seek to fill so-called vacuum or put up exclusive blocs,” it said, in an apparent reference to the U.S.At the close of the ceremonial legislature’s annual session Monday, leader Xi Jinping said China should “actively participate in the reform and construction of the global governance system” and promote “global security initiatives,”The diplomatic victory comes as Washington has heavily criticized China for failing to condemn Russia’s invasion and for accusing the U.S. and NATO of provoking the conflict.However, many Middle Eastern governments view China as a neutral party, with strong ties to both Saudi Arabia, China’s largest oil supplier, and Iran, which relies on China for 30% of its foreign trade and in which China has pledged to invest $400 billion over 25 years. Iran, which has few export markets owing to sanctions over its nuclear program, sells oil to China at a steep discount.The deal “boosts Beijing’s ability to project an image of itself as a constructive actor for peace, which will be helpful for fending off accusations from the West that it is supporting Russia’s invasion in Ukraine,” said Amanda Hsiao, Taipei-based analyst for the International Crisis Group.“It demonstrates that China is trying to conduct competition in foreign diplomacy with the U.S., and not only in its immediate neighborhood,” said Wang Lian, an international relations professor at Beijing’s prestigious Peking University. The successful negotiations show the two countries “placed their trust in China,” Wang said.China created the position of special envoy for the Middle East in 2002, focusing on Israel and the Palestinian Authority. While China sells drones and other weaponry to countries in the region, it does so nowhere on the scale of the United States and without political conditions.Earlier, China moved aggressively to build ties in the South Pacific, signing a security agreement with the Solomon Islands that could see Chinese naval ships and security forces taking up a presence in the country. The U.S., Australia and others moved swiftly to shore up ties in the Pacific, and China’s efforts to ink similar agreements with other island nations ultimately foundered.Having secured a norm-breaking third five-year term in office, Xi appears more confrontational than ever toward the West, with his foreign minister warning just days earlier of future “conflict and confrontation” with the U.S.However, that strain of tough-talking “wolf warrior” diplomacy is mainly reserved for developed nations seen as rivals, while China has been “admirably diplomatic” with others, said Miami's Dreyer. Having largely written off the democratic West, China has been willing to build close ties with authoritarian regimes from North Korea to Nicaragua.Though China is active in U.N. peacekeeping operations, Beijing's previous efforts at third-party mediation have sagged under the weight of its political baggage. A recent Chinese proposal calling for a cease-fire and peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine went nowhere.China's decision to mediate between Iran and Saudi Arabia was highly deliberate, both because the two are key to regional stability and for the opportunity to “poke a finger” in Washington's eye, said Yitzhak Shichor, professor of political science and Asian studies at Israel's University of Haifa and a leading expert on Beijing's ties with the region.It's too soon to say whether the agreement will bring lasting improvements between the two longtime adversaries, much less greater Mideast stability. None of their fundamental conflicts appear to have been discussed.But for Saudi Arabia, the agreement may facilitate its quest for an off-ramp from its proxy war against Iran-backed Houthis rebels in Yemen. And for Iran, it could contribute to greater regional stability at a time of mounting domestic problems.Not everyone happy about the agreement.Under political pressure at home, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has threatened military action against Iran’s nuclear program as it enriches closer than ever to weapons-grade levels. Riyadh seeking an accommodation with Tehran takes one potential ally for a strike off the table.It was unclear what this development meant for Washington, whose Middle East presence has waned since the end of its withdrawal from Iraq and amid its growing energy independence.However, the White House bristled at the notion that a Saudi-Iran agreement in Beijing suggests that Chinese influence could replace the U.S. in the Mideast. “I would stridently push back on this idea that we’re stepping back in the Middle East — far from it,” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said.The fact that Saudi Arabia struck the agreement without Washington shows they are “seeking to diversify their bets on security and not rely wholly on the United States,” Jon Alterman of the Center for Strategic & International Studies, wrote in a note on the deal.“The U.S. government is of two minds on that; it wants the Saudis to take increasing responsibility for their own security, but it does not want Saudi Arabia freelancing and undermining U.S. security strategies,” Alterman wrote.",2023/03/13,,World

The study examines the market’s current and future developments.The global ceramics market size is valued at USD 283.20 billion in 2023 and is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5. 7% from 2023 to 2030.Ceramics are inorganic nonmetallic materials that are both hardy and brittle. These transparent materials can be shaped into many shapes, including porcelain and earthenware. Ceramics are very malleable, ductile, and thermally as well chemically stable. Ceramic materials are excellent electrical insulators. Superconductive ceramics and piezoelectric clays are exceptions. These materials are used in many industries, including construction and health care.Request for a sample report here: https://market.biz/report/global-ceramics-market-qy/389775/#requestforsampleAdvanced ceramics are more resistant to corrosion than other materials (such as steel and aluminum), which results in lower maintenance costs and other costs for automobiles, armors, and aircraft. These ceramics are attractive to many industries such as aerospace, energy and protection, defense, automotive and electronics. Component breakage is common in components of energy and defense, aviation, defense, and automotive. This happens due to thermal expansion. Advanced ceramics exhibit a lower rate of thermal expansion when placed in the same environment as conventional metals and alloys. This has led to their widespread use in various industries.The market will continue to grow due to the increasing urbanization and rapid economic growth. Market value will rise due to rising infrastructure spending. Market growth will be supported by the expansion of automotive and other end-use industries.Saint-Gobain

OthersMany industries have been concerned by the high costs of ceramics and advanced ceramics. Ceramic prices are largely determined by the cost of ceramic fibers. However, the production of alumina or silicon carbide fibers is still very low. These fibers are used primarily as composites in a number of industries including aerospace, defense, marine, and military. The slow production of ceramic fibers causes silicon carbide prices to rise, which limits the growth of advanced ceramics. Matrix generation is another factor that contributes to higher prices for these ceramics. This is because matrix generation requires expensive batch processes at high temperatures under controlled circumstances.A lack of customer awareness and trust in ceramic materials is the biggest threat to the market. This leads to a lower adoption rate. These ceramics are also too expensive, making them unsuitable for low-cost applications. This further reduces their acceptance among the populace. The lower acceptance of ceramics will limit the market growth rate.Get This Whole Report From Here: https://market.biz/checkout/?reportId=389775&type=Single%20UserTable content:N-Heptane market–

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833582,Tour de Taiwan Stage 2 ends in Taoyuan,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The Tour de Taiwan, a five-day international cycling race starting in Taipei and ending in Kaohsiung, continued with a Stage 2 competition.Monday’s course (March 13) covered 120.59 kilometers, ending with a mountain-top finish in Taoyuan. Weather conditions were not ideal as riders struggled with strong winds, slight rain, and chilly temperatures dipping to 12 C, per race organizers.Taoyuan Mayor Chang San-cheng (張善政) presided over the start of the race. In a prepared speech, he pledged to give riders a special experience with a distinctive race course that would test riders' physical strength and endurance.At 9:30 a.m, a starting pistol was fired in front of Taoyuan City Hall and the race commenced with some 60% of the race course being conducted on expressways, making for fast conditions before ultimately turning into the mountains. Riders pushed hard from the start, with Jack Aitken from ST George Continental Cycling Team breaking away, followed by Lu Shao-hsuan (盧紹軒) (Taiwan) and Hoonmin Jun (Seoul Cycling Team) in a breakaway pursuit 30 km into the race.Lu was the first to reach the first sprint point, Datan Elementary School, gaining three points, though he soon fell back from the lead due to mechanical failure before the first climb, leaving only Aitken and Hoonmin Jun in the lead, per race organizers.However, the peloton would eventually catch up with Aitken three km before the finish line, making for an exciting sprint finish, with Jordi Lopez Caravaca from Equipo Kern Pharma emerging as the stage winner, marking his first professional race win.""It's an incredible feeling to secure my first professional victory here in Taiwan. The mountain-top finish was tough, but I was determined to push through and give it my all,” said Caravaca at a press conference afterward. He added, “I'm thrilled to have come out on top and to have experienced such a warm welcome in this beautiful country.”In terms of overall ranking, Raymond Kreder kept the yellow jersey and was closely followed by Lopez Caravaca by just two seconds. Last year's winner, Benjamin Dyball, is currently sitting in 37th place, 15 seconds behind the leader.Thailand’s Thanakhan Chaiyasombat retained the blue jersey for the second day in a row as the best Asian rider.",2023/03/13,807,Sports & Entertainment

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833611,China's 'wolf warrior' Zhao Lijian relegated to painting border markers,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A former ""wolf warrior"" diplomat notorious for his caustic comments is being mocked by Chinese netizens for being relegated to menial work, such as painting an obscure border marker following his demotion in January.Zhao Lijian (趙立堅), a former spokesperson for China's Foreign Ministry, was known for making aggressive comments such as warning that Beijing would not ""sit idly by"" if former U.S. House Speaker Pelosi were to go through with her trip to Taiwan in 2022. However, in December, Zhao stopped appearing at Foreign Ministry press conferences, and it was later revealed that he had been demoted to the post of deputy director of the Department of Boundary and Ocean Affairs Department.On March 9, Weibo user ""Lovey Zhao Shushu"" (可愛多趙蜀黍) posted an image of Zhao standing next to a Qing Dynasty (1644–1911) stele marking a boundary in Guangxi Province. On March 10, the Weibo user posted a photo of Zhao and an unidentified official standing next to another boundary marker in Guangxi identifying the boundary with Vietnam.The next day, the Weibo account posted a photo of Zhao dressed in casual clothes while painting a border pillar in Aijiang Village, Daxin County, Chongzuo, Guangxi, which is also along the boundary with Vietnam. Many Chinese netizens mocked Zhao's substantially reduced role:""Demoted a thousand miles away?""""Where the motherland needs me to go, I will absolutely go there!""""I wonder how some people can talk nonsense while keeping a straight face?"" If you tell too many lies, you will have a split personality.""Twitter user Teacher Li is not Your Teacher (李老師不是你老師), a key figure who promoted the White Paper Revolution, on March 10 posted the image of Zhao standing next to the Qing Dynasty stele, prompting ridicule by followers:""He really was demoted to the very bottom.""""He brought us a lot of fun when he was in the limelight. I miss him!""""I'm sneaking around having fun, please do not disturb.""Some China observers believe that Zhao was possibly demoted because of what were deemed to be inappropriate remarks by his wife, Tang Tianru (湯天如). Many Chinese netizens discovered a series of photos of Tang traveling to Germany in June 2022, while ordinary Chinese were under harsh travel restrictions and expressing her appreciation for what she considered a ""normal life"" there.In another post uploaded in December, Tang complained about the lack of fever medication in China and felt ""helpless,"" prompting some to interpret this as meaning that Zhao was infected with COVID. Having been absent from foreign ministry press conferences since December, China announced on Jan. 10 that Zhao had been reassigned to his current position.Zhao Lijian stands next to Qing Dynasty stele.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833641,"UN chief: 'Cold, hard facts' should guide climate policy","BERLIN (AP) — The head of the United Nations called Monday for scientists to serve up “cold, hard facts” to push governments into making policies that curb climate change before a key global warming threshold is passed.His comments came as experts and officials from around the world gathered for a week-long meeting in the Swiss Alpine town of Interlaken to finalize the last of seven reports issued by the global body's panel of top scientists since the Paris climate accord was forged in 2015.In a video address to delegates, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said that the latest report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change “could not come at a more pivotal time.”“Our world is at a crossroads — and our planet is in the crosshairs,” he said. “We are nearing the point of no return; of overshooting the internationally agreed limit of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) of global warming.”That threshold, agreed in Paris almost eight years ago and measured against average temperatures during pre-industrial times, has become the yardstick for climate scientists who warn of the dangers of an ever hotter planet.Guterres cited recent IPCC reports showing that while some impacts of global warming are already unavoidable, “it is possible to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees with rapid and deep emissions reductions across all sectors of the global economy."" Some scientists disagree, noting that the rate at which greenhouse gas is being pumped into the atmosphere makes this limit almost impossible to keep to.The U.N. chief said the final installment in the IPCC's sixth reporting cycle — known as the synthesis report because it brings together insights from six previous papers — should provide governments with “solid, frank, detailed scientific guidance to make the right decisions for people and planet” when they gather for the annual world climate conference in Dubai at the end of the year.Guterres stressed that speeding up the phase-out of fossil fuels is “tough but essential.”“Show the urgent need to end global heating with cold, hard facts,” he told delegates.",2023/03/13,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833642,"March Madness top teams bring talent and, for some, baggage","Kansas and Alabama are no strangers to playing for national championships.For the Jayhawks, another high-expectations trip to March Madness is a rite of spring. For the Crimson Tide, well, this path to glory travels through some unfamiliar ground — the basketball court.Alabama rolls in as the top overall seed in an NCAA Tournament that feels both familiar and foreign this season. Yes, there are plenty of heartwarming stories and unbelievable upsets to come when the action begins Tuesday with the first of four play-in games.But this was also a season clouded with police blotters at Alabama and Texas, injuries at Houston and UCLA, some unsightly losses at Kansas, and enough twists and turns at the top of the field to make this as unpredictable a bracket as ever.“I'm not sure we would've predicted this,” Alabama coach Nate Oats said of the top seeding that belongs to the Crimson Tide for the first time.Alabama's ability to set aside distractions — namely, the inevitable questions that will be directed at its star, Brandon Miller, and others about an o ngoing murder case against a former member of the team — could have as big an impact on the Crimson Tide's chances as anything.But all these teams, especially at the top, have their issues.It starts with Houston, the 1 seed in the Midwest, which was cruising along until Saturday, when its star guard, Marcus Sasser, fell awkwardly and left the game with a groin injury.Sasser didn't play in his team's conference title game and Houston lost. How quickly he gets back to form could dictate whether the Cougars make the Final Four, which will take place at NRG Stadium, not far from their home arena.Or take the Jayhawks, who looked like the top overall seed for a time. Two double-digit losses to Texas knocked them down a few notches. They are top seeded, but will play in the West, not the Midwest — one of those rare teams that might have preferred a possible trip down the road to Kansas City over a flight to Las Vegas for the Sweet 16. Not helping the situation was the recent illness of coach Bill Self, who was feeling chest tightness and checked himself into the hospital before the Big 12 Tournament. He was released Sunday and is expected to be with the Jayhawks this week.“They mark it how they feel and we’re just going to do what we need to do to get where we need to be,” Kansas forward KJ Adams said.There are issues one notch down the bracket, too.No. 2 UCLA has been dealing with injuries all season. Most recently, guard Jaylen Clark (Achilles) and big man Adem Bona (shoulder) have gone down. Clark won't be back; Bona might. It takes a hunk out of a team that still has the core of a roster that lost to Gonzaga on a buzzer-beater from near midcourt at the Final Four two years ago.Another 2 seed, Texas, has had months to bounce back from the firing of coach Chris Beard, whose fiancee called in a domestic dispute that led to the coach's arrest. Charges were eventually dropped. By then, Rodney Terry had taken over the team and it found its footing, though the ugliness of the episode is bound to be rehashed during basketball's biggest month.Back among the No. 1 seeds, Purdue has a 7-foot-4 playmaker, Zach Edey, leading the way and also has a little baggage of its own. Coach Matt Painter's program has now made the tournament 14 times in his 18 years but has advanced as far as the Elite Eight only once. This is the first time one of Painter's teams has come in as a top seed, though.The coach is as aware as anyone how a trip to the Final Four might just cover up a lot of those old blemishes.“Obviously, I know,"" Painter said, “you get judged on what you do in the tournament.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/13,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833643,NCAA Tournament success depends on strong guard play,"Anyone trying to fill out their NCAA Tournament brackets ought to start by figuring out which teams have the best backcourts.This has been a guard’s event for years.When Kansas’ Ochai Agbaji helped the Jayhawks win the national title last season, he became the eighth straight guard to be selected as a Final Four’s most outstanding player. The list started with UConn's Shabazz Napier in 2014 and continued with Duke’s Tyus Jones, Villanova’s Ryan Arcidiacono, North Carolina’s Joel Berry II, Villanova’s Donte DiVincenzo, Virginia’s Kyle Guy and Baylor’s Jared Butler.Occasionally a big man can dominate the college basketball landscape the way Anthony Davis did while leading Kentucky to the 2012 title, but they’re the exceptions. The NCAA Tournament generally is all about guard play.Here’s a look at six backcourts that merit watching.BAYLOR: L.J. Cryer, Adam Flagler and Keyonte George.Baylor won the NCAA Tournament two years ago behind its outstanding backcourt and will try to do it again with a different set of guards. All three of them score at least 14.5 points per game. Flagler was one of five finalists for the Jerry West Award given to the nation’s top shooting guard. He also earned AP first-team all-Big 12 honors. George, the best pro prospect in the trio, was a second-team all-Big 12 pick. Baylor ranks second in Division I in adjusted offensive efficiency, a metric measured by college basketball stats guru Ken Pomeroy that essentially translates to points scored per 100 possessions when adjusted for the level of competition.HOUSTON: Marcus Sasser and Jamal Shead.Sasser is one of 10 semifinalists for the Naismith Award given to the national player of the year He's eager for this NCAA Tournament showcase after a foot injury ended his 2021-22 season after just 12 games. He injured his groin in the American Athletic Association Tournament and didn't play in Sunday's championship game, so it remains to be seen how close he is to full strength. Sasser has scored over 17 points per game each of the last two seasons. Shead has nearly three times as many assists as turnovers.KANSAS: Gradey Dick, Dajuan Harris and Kevin McCullar Jr.The defending national champions had to replace virtually their entire nucleus from last year but still put together an outstanding backcourt to complement forward Jalen Wilson, the AP Big 12 player of the year. Dick, a freshman, is a Jerry West Award finalist, scoring nearly 15 points per game; he arguably is more a small forward at 6-foot-8, but Kansas lists him as a guard. Dick and McCullar both were AP second-team all-Big 12 selections. McCullar, a Texas Tech transfer, has scored in double figures three straight seasons and is pulling down over 7 rebounds per game. Harris is dishing out over 6 assists per game and ranks third among all Division I players in assist-turnover ratio.MARQUETTE: Kam Jones, Tyler Kolek and Stevie Mitchell.Kolek, a Naismith Award semifinalist and the Big East player of the year, has 7.7 assists per game and has well over three times as many assists as turnovers. He was named the Big East Tournament MVP. Jones, a second-team AP all-Big East selection, leads Marquette in scoring and makes nearly three 3-pointers per game. Mitchell has over 7 points per game but is best known for his defense. This group helped Marquette win its first Big East outright regular-season title and first Big East Tournament championship.MIAMI: Jordan Miller, Nijel Pack and Isaiah Wong.This trio helped Miami win a share of the Atlantic Coast Conference regular-season title and earn the No. 1 seed in the ACC Tournament for the first time since 2013. Wong is a Jerry West Award finalist and AP first-team all-ACC pick. He was named ACC player of the year by a 75-member panel including coaches and media representatives. Wong, Miller and Pack are each scoring over 13 points per game.XAVIER: Souley Boum, Colby Jones and Adam Kunkel.This trio helped Xavier lead all Division I teams in assists per game. Boum and Jones are each averaging over 4 assists per game, while Kunkel has 3 per game. They’re also scoring about a combined 42 points per game. Boum, an AP first-team all-Big East selection, ranks second in the conference in scoring. Jones was an AP second-team all-Big East pick. ___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833644,"UK approves increased submarine-related exports to Taiwan, risking angering China","Britain approved a sharp increase in exports of submarine parts and technology last year to Taiwan as it upgrades its naval forces, a move that could impact British ties with China.The value of licences granted by the British government to companies for the export of submarine-related components and technology to Taiwan totalled a record 167 million pounds ($201.29 million) during the first nine months of last year, according to UK government export licensing data. That is more than the previous six years combined, a Reuters analysis of the data showed.The data is publicly accessible but the most recent Taiwan-related figures haven’t previously been reported.Beijing considers Taiwan part of China, known as the One-China policy, and strongly objects to perceived foreign interference with the island believing it to be support for Taiwan’s desire to be recognised as its own country.When presented with the figures by Reuters, China’s foreign ministry said in a statement: ""If this is true, it is a serious violation of the one-China principle, undermines China's sovereignty and security interests, and undermines peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.”“China is highly concerned about this and firmly opposes it,” said the written statement, which urged Britain to “refrain from providing military support to the Taiwan authorities.”Britain does not recognise Taiwan and has no formal diplomatic relations with the island but it maintains economic and trade ties and there is a de facto British embassy in Taipei.A British government spokesperson said in a statement the UK has a long record of “granting licences for exports of controlled goods to Taiwan, on a case-by-case basis, where those applications are consistent with the rules that regulate the exports of arms and dual-use products.”""We consider the Taiwan issue one to be settled peacefully by the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait through constructive dialogue, without the threat or use of force or coercion,"" the statement added.The increase in licences granted reflects greater demand from Taiwan, two government officials said on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue.Two lawmakers with knowledge of the exports and two former officials said the approvals reflected Britain’s increased willingness to support Taiwan. One of the lawmakers, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity, said authorising the export licences amounted to giving a ""green light"" to better equip Taiwan.The data is from the Export Control Organisation, which is responsible for export licensing and sits within the UK Department for International Trade. It shows the government authorised 25 export licences to Taiwan during the first nine months of 2022 under the categories ""components for submarines"" and ""technology for submarines.""The data doesn’t disclose which companies received the authorisation or detail what specific equipment it covers.One licence type, called ML9, covers “vessels of war, special naval equipment, accessories, components, and other surface vessels,"" according to Britain’s list of strategic military items that require export authorisation. Another license type, ML22, includes technology that is required for the development, production, operation, installation, maintenance, repair or goods or software.The British government on Monday announced a boost to defence spending as it unveiled an update to its defence, security and foreign policy priorities, setting out how it plans to “tackle new threats” from China and Russia.HEIGHTENED TENSIONSMilitary tensions between Beijing and Taipei are at their highest in decades. Taiwan, some 100 miles south east from the Chinese coast, has said it is building a fleet of submarines to build up their naval defences. Taiwan has for decades been unable to buy conventional submarines from other countries because of their concerns of angering China.Taiwan’s democratically-elected government strongly rejects China’s sovereignty claims, saying only the island’s people can decide their future.As Reuters previously reported, an array of foreign submarine-technology vendors, with the approval of their governments, have been aiding the program.In response to a request for comment about the submarine-related exports from Britain, Taiwan’s defence ministry said in a statement that its ship-building programme was ""a major national policy, and the navy has promoted various projects in a pragmatic way under it.""""We hope that all walks of life will continue to give their support, to jointly maintain the security and peace of the Taiwan Strait,"" the ministry said.Taipei aims to test its first prototype by September and deliver the first of the planned eight vessels by 2025.Britain’s granting of submarine-related licences began to tick up after Taiwan announced it planned to build the submarine fleet in 2017.Britain approved the export of 87 million pounds worth of submarine components and technology to Taiwan in 2020, up from 31,415 pounds in 2017 and none in 2016, according to the licensing data. The value of such licences approved in 2021 dipped to just under 9 million pounds.UK 'TILT' TO INDO-PACIFICBritain’s Integrated Review, a document laying out the country’s defence, security and foreign policy priorities that was published in March 2021, specified a “tilt” to the Indo-Pacific but didn’t mention Taiwan.Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last year has raised questions in Britain and elsewhere in the West about other possible future flash points around the world.Britain’s defence minister, Ben Wallace, told Reuters last month that the West’s actions in support of Kyiv was a signal to other countries that grabbing land does not pay off. ""This conflict is important because the world is watching whether the West will stand up for its values of freedom, democracy, liberal societies and the rule of law,"" he said.Western lawmakers and other officials have been stepping up their visits to Taiwan, despite Beijing's objections. That included one in November by Britain’s then minister of state for trade, Greg Hands. ""We urge the British side to stop any form of official exchanges with Taiwan and stop sending wrong signals to separatist forces for Taiwan independence,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said at the time.Tobias Ellwood, head of the UK parliament’s defence committee and a member in Britain’s governing Conservative Party who visited Taiwan in December, told Reuters the British government had to be careful about what detail it publicly provides about the equipment covered by the export licences.""An announcement of the specific nature of these exports risks revealing sensitive information on Taiwan's defensive capabilities and some of the UK government's caution in discussing these exports is valid,"" Ellwood said.One of the former British officials said: ""Every decision around Taiwan is made very deliberately and usually cautiously."" Asked about the decision to approve the increase in export licences, the official said: ""You just don't do something like this without thinking through the implications very carefully.""($1 = 0.8297 pounds)(Additional reporting by Ben Blanchard in Taipei, Martin Quin Pollard in Beijing and Andy Bruce and Paul Sandle in London; editing by Cassell Bryan-Low)",2023/03/13,1958,Politics

The Wall Street Journal reported last month that a visit to Moscow could take place in April or early May.China's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the possibility of Xi going to Moscow and the Kremlin declined to comment.No other details were immediately available.The sources briefed on the matter declined to be identified given the sensitivity of the issue.Last month, Putin hosted China's top diplomat Wang Yi on a visit to Moscow and signalled that Xi would travel to Russia.China and Russia struck a ""no limits"" partnership in February of 2022, when Putin was visiting Beijing for the opening of the Winter Olympics, weeks before Russia invaded Ukraine, and the two sides have continued to reaffirm the strength of their ties.Xi has met Putin in person 39 times since becoming president, most recently in September during a summit in central Asia.On Monday, Xi wrapped up the annual session of China's parliament, the National People's Congress, during which he was unanimously confirmed in a precedent-breaking third term as president.(Reporting by the Hong Kong, Beijing and Moscow newsrooms; Editing by Robert Birsel)",2023/03/13,293,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833693,"Iran says 22,000 arrested in protests pardoned by top leader","DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iran announced Monday that the country's supreme leader has pardoned more than 22,000 people arrested in the recent anti-government protests that swept the Islamic Republic. There was no immediate independent confirmation of the mass release.The statement by Iran's judiciary head Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejehi offered for the first time a glimpse of the full scope of the government's crackdown that followed the demonstrations over the September death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who had been detained by the country's morality police.It also suggests that Iran's theocracy now feels secure enough to admit the scale of the unrest, which represented one of the most-serious challenges to the establishment since the aftermath of the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Tens of thousands also were detained in the purges that followed the revolution.However, anger still remains in the country as it struggles through the collapse of the nation’s currency, the rial, economic woes, and uncertainty over its ties to the wider world after the collapse of Tehran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers.The state-run IRNA news agency quoted Ejehi as announcing the figure Monday. Iranian state media had previously suggested Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei could pardon that many people swept up in the demonstrations, ahead of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, when the pious fast from dawn to dusk. Ramadan starts later next week.Ejehi said a total of 82,656 prisoners and those facing charges had been pardoned. Of those, some 22,628 had been arrested amid the demonstrations, he said. Those pardoned had not committed theft or violent crimes, he added. His comments suggest that the true total of those detained in the demonstrations is even greater.In February, Iran had acknowledged “tens of thousands” had been detained in the protests. Monday's acknowledgment from Ejehi offered an even higher than what activists had previously cited. However, there's been no mass release of prisoners documented in recent days by Iranian media reports or activists.More than 19,700 people have been arrested during the protests, according to Human Rights Activists in Iran, a group that’s been tracking the crackdown. At least 530 people have been killed as authorities violently suppressed demonstrations, the group said. Iran has not offered a death toll for months.“From day one there was no transparent accounting of who was arrested and imprisoned — before or after the mass protests these past months — which is why there’s no way to verify how many are being released now,” said Jasmin Ramsey, the deputy director of the U.S.-based Center for Human Rights in Iran.“We also know that more than five months after the death of ... Mahsa Amini in state custody, not a single Iranian official has been held accountable for the mass killings of street protesters, nor the arbitrary imprisonments of tens of thousands.”The judiciary's announcement also came ahead of next week's celebration of Nowruz, the Persian New Year. On Tuesday, some in Iran also mark nearly 4,000-year-old Persian tradition known as the Festival of Fire that's linked to the Zoroastrian religion. Hard-liners discourage such celebrations, viewing them as pagan holdovers.There had been calls for anti-government protests around both events. While mass demonstrations have cooled in recent weeks, nightly chants against Iran's theocracy can still be heard in some neighborhoods of Iran's capital, Tehran.The announcement followed a major development last week, when Iran and Saudi Arabia said on Friday that with China's mediation, they agreed to reestablish diplomatic ties and reopen embassies after a seven-year freeze in relations. That agreement could help aid an end to the yearslong war in Yemen, which sees a Saudi-led coalition battle the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels who hold its capital, Sanaa. It has also helped boost the rial in recent days against the dollar.Meanwhile, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko visited Tehran and met Monday with his Iranian counterpart, Ebrahim Raisi. Iran has been supplying the bomb-carrying drones that Russia now uses in its war on Ukraine. Lukashenko, the authoritarian leader of Belarus, remains close to Russia, which used Belarusian territory to launch Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.Lukashenko said his country and Iran would sign an unspecified set of deals valued at $100 million.Iran “opposes external pressure, attempts to impose someone else’s will,"" Lukashenko said, addressing his hosts. ""And how, in spite of everything, you develop modern technologies and nuclear energy. And, as we decided today with the president of Iran, we can be very useful to each other if we truly unite our efforts.”___Follow Jon Gambrell on Twitter at www.twitter.com/jongambrellAP.",2023/03/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833694,March Madness betting guide: Upsets shuffle favorites' odds,"LAS VEGAS (AP) — March Madness isn't just about filling out — and later trashing — brackets. There are more ways to bet the field in the NCAA Tournament, an event that will consume basketball fans over the next three weeks. Here's a look at the favorites, underdogs and long shots.WHO’S FAVORED TO REACH THE FINAL FOUR?Earlier this week, top-seeded Houston was the plus-135 favorite to emerge as the Midwest Region representative and play in Houston, according to FanDuel Sportsbook. That means a $100 bet pays $135. The next top team in the region is No. 5 Texas at plus-350.Alabama, the No. 1 overall seed, was plus-150 to come out of the South.The most competitive region appears to be the West. Top seed Kansas opened as a slight favorite but later shared that spot with 2-seed UCLA at plus-330 (before the Jayhawks were ousted). No. 3 seed Gonzaga wasn't far behind at plus-400.Top seed Purdue was at plus-300 to come out of the East, but the Boilermakers lost in the first round.WHO’S FAVORED TO WIN THE TITLE?After a batch of first-round upsets, the favorites listed by FanDuel Sportsbook got shuffled a bit over the weekend: Houston was the top favorite at plus-440, just ahead of Houston (+490). UCLA was next (+700).WHO IS THE BIGGEST UNDERDOG?If you're looking for the next Saint Peter's or Loyola-Chicago, check out these options.Nineteen teams were listed at plus-50,000: Arizona State, Charleston, Colgate, Furman, Grand Canyon, Howard, Iona, Kennesaw State, Kent State, Louisiana-Lafayette, Montana State, Nevada, Northern Kentucky, Oral Roberts, Texas A&M-Corpus Christi, Texas Southern, UC Santa Barbara, UNC Asheville and Vermont. Furman did advance to the second round with a big win over 4th-seeded Virginia but that was it. Fairleigh Dickinson or Princeton, anyone?WHAT’S THE BIGGEST SPREAD DIFFERENCE?Alabama was a 23 1/2-point favorite over Texas A&M-Corpus Christi. Kansas was favored by 22 1/2-over Howard in their first-round matchup — the same spread Fairleigh Dickinson faced against Purdue before its shocking 63-58 win.WHAT’S THE BIGGEST OVER/UNDER?The old saying is that life is too short to bet the under, but it's often the wise play. Some of these totals may give bettors second thoughts before taking the over, but that doesn't mean it's the wrong move.The highest totals heading into the tourney were Gonzaga-Grand Canyon, Missouri-Utah State and Texas A&M Corpus Christi-Southeast Missouri State at 155 1/2 each, Xavier-Kennesaw State at 153 1/2, Auburn-Iowa at 151 1/2 and Florida Atlantic-Memphis and Colgate-Texas at 150 1/2 each.NOT REAL UNDERDOGSJust because the committee seeds one team over another doesn't necessarily mean it's the better team in the minds of the oddsmakers. Games where the lower seed was the favorite on the early line: Tenth-seeded Utah State by 1 1/2 points over seventh-seeded Missouri (Missouri won), ninth-seeded West Virginia by 2 1/2 over eighth-seeded Maryland (Maryland won) and ninth-seeded Auburn by 1 1/2 over eighth-seeded Iowa (Auburn won 83-75).PROPSCirca Sports in Las Vegas likes the chances of the 5-12 opening-round upset trend continuing, posting the odds of a No. 12 seed winning at minus-510. Odds also are in the favor of a No. 13 beating a four-seed at minus-250.A victory by a No. 14 (plus-110), No. 15 (plus-195) and No. 16 (plus-745) aren't as likely but that's March Madness: A 15 and a 16 won in the first round, after all.The Big 12 had the highest total for number of tournament wins by a conference at 11.BRACKETSThe chase for the perfect bracket in office pools and everywhere else ended before the second round this year. Wins by the likes of 15-seed Princeton, 13-seed Furman and 16-seed Fairleigh Dickinson's near-historic win over No. 1 seed Purdue left the number of perfect brackets at 0 late Friday in the major contests run by ESPN, CBS Sports, the NCAA and others.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/19,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833695,BBC backtracks on Lineker over tweet slamming UK asylum plan,"LONDON (AP) — The BBC called a truce Monday in its showdown with sports commentator Gary Lineker, reversing its suspension of the former soccer great for a tweet that criticized the U.K. government’s contentious new migration policy.The about-face followed a weekend of chaos and crisis for Britain's publicly funded national broadcaster, which faced a huge backlash after sidelining one of its best-known hosts because he expressed a political opinion.“Gary is a valued part of the BBC and I know how much the BBC means to Gary, and I look forward to him presenting our coverage this coming weekend,” BBC Director-General Tim Davie said.Lineker, 62, said he was “glad that we have found a way forward.”The furor stems from a plan announced last week by Britain's Conservative government to try to stop tens of thousands of migrants a year from reaching the country in small boats across the English Channel. A new bill will bar asylum claims by anyone who reaches the U.K. by unauthorized means and will compel the government to detain and deport them “to their home country or a safe third country.”The legislation has been condemned by refugee groups and the U.N., and the government concedes it may breach international law.Lineker, one of England’s most lauded players and the corporation’s highest-paid television presenter, was suspended after he described the plan on Twitter as “immeasurably cruel"" and called the government's language ""not dissimilar to that used by Germany in the 30s.”The Daily Telegraph and the Daily Mail — two right-leaning newspapers long critical of the BBC — expressed outrage over what they described in headlines as Lineker’s “Nazi” comment, although he hadn't used the word.The Conservative government called Lineker’s comparison offensive and unacceptable, and some lawmakers said the BBC should sack him.The broadcaster announced Friday that Lineker would be “stepping back” until he agreed to keep his tweets within BBC impartiality rules.Critics accused the BBC of suppressing free speech, and it was forced to scrap much of its weekend sports programming after commentators, analysts and Premier League players refused to appear on air as a show of support for Lineker.The flagship “Match of the Day” program was reduced from the usual 90 minutes of highlights and analysis to a 20-minute compilation of clips from the day’s games, without commentary or punditry. Other TV and radio soccer shows were pulled from the schedule on Saturday and Sunday as the boycott spread.Davie insisted Monday that the BBC “did the right thing” by suspending Lineker, but said there would now be an independent review of its social media rules to address “gray areas” in the guidelines.“Between now and when the review reports, Gary will abide by the editorial guidelines,"" he said.Davie said the BBC “has a commitment to impartiality in its Charter,” as well as a commitment to freedom of expression.“That is a difficult balancing act to get right,” he said.The furor reflects the distinctive nature of U.K. media, where newspapers are highly opinionated and news broadcasters are required to be balanced — especially the taxpayer-funded BBC, which has a duty to be impartial.The crisis dramatically illustrated the pressures long faced by the 100-year-old BBC in an increasingly polarized political and media world. Those on the right often sense a leftist slant in the broadcaster’s news output, while some liberals accuse it of having a conservative bias.Opposition politicians have accused the government of meddling by pushing for Conservative-friendly bosses for the BBC. Davie is former Conservative local-government candidate. BBC chairman Richard Sharp is a Conservative Party donor who helped arrange a loan in 2021 for then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson, weeks before Sharp was appointed to the BBC post on the government’s recommendation.The Conservatives also periodically suggest changing the BBC's funding model. It gets much of its money from a license fee paid by all households with a television.The opposition Labour Party's culture and media spokeswoman, Lucy Powell, said the Conservatives “have long wanted to undermine the BBC.”“As well as a review of the BBC’s social media guidelines, this saga should prompt the government to examine how it protects and promotes a truly independent and impartial BBC,"" she said.As part of its commitment to impartiality, the BBC bars news staff from expressing political opinions.Lineker, as a freelancer who doesn’t work in news or current affairs, isn’t bound by the same rules, and has sometimes pushed the boundaries of what the BBC considers acceptable. Last year, the BBC found that Lineker breached its rules with a tweet about alleged donations from Russians to the Conservatives.James Harding, a former BBC director of news, said the corporation has got into a “muddle” over the issue of impartiality.He said it was important that the broadcaster “that delivers news and information that informs the country is impartial,” but added: ""You can’t get to a world in which the BBC is policing the opinions of every writer, director, musician, sports personality, scientist, business entrepreneur.""Lineker said it had been “a surreal few days” and thanked colleagues for their support. And he showed no signs of stopping his use of social media.“A final thought: however difficult the last few days have been, it simply doesn’t compare to having to flee your home from persecution or war to seek refuge in a land far away,"" he tweeted to his 8.8 million followers. “It’s heartwarming to have seen the empathy towards their plight from so many of you.”___Follow AP’s coverage of migration issues at https://apnews.com/hub/migration and soccer at https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/14,,World
