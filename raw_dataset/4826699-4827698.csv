https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4826707,Emre Can delivers as Dortmund’s title charge takes hold,"Dortmund’s run since the turn of the year is laying the foundations of something potentially quite special. It’s eight from eight in the Bundesliga after this riproaring Friday night classic under the lights, as Dortmund go three points clear to position themselves as the chief challenger to Bayern Munich’s decade of domestic hegemony.Eight straight wins equals a club record set in 2011-12 when Jürgen Klopp used to roam the corridors here. Edin Terzic has the keys now and he’s overseeing a spell of form that is every bit as energizing as what Klopp brought to this club. The atmosphere in Signal Iduna Park was raucous, feverish at times, with the wall of sound muffled only in the final 15 minutes after Emil Forsberg had halved Dortmund’s lead.Previous editions of Dortmund in the last decade may have cracked under the pressure of that final quarter hour but this was a night when 80,000 fans roared after every blocked cross or crunching tackle. As Leipzig ended the game strongly, Dortmund had to fight for this win and just when the visitors thought they’d got a point in injury-time, Nico Schlotterbeck made a goal-line clearance. Chest bumps all round.If this was a victory Dortmund secured with grit, it was built on the attractive, attacking vibrancy of the first half. Julian Brandt was outstanding again – an unfortunate handball ruled out by VAR in what would have been a fifth goal in as many Bundesliga games – and Marius Wolf enjoyed an influential game. Marco Reus was close to his best too, winning and scoring the opener from the spot after being caught by Leipzig keeper Janis Blaswich. It was a goal that draws him level with Michael Zorc as Dortmund's second highest goalscorer, now only behind the legendary Manfred Burgsmüller.The second of the night came courtesy of Emre Can, a player who doesn’t always get the credit he deserves but who often plays a crucial role. The Germany player can be overshadowed by the talismanic Jude Bellingham, but in his preferred role of central midfield, Can is dynamic and capable of bringing as much to Dortmund’s attacks as in defence. Although his primal instinct is to defend and he formed an effective wall alongside Bellingham and Salih Özcan, limiting the influence of Forsberg and Dominik Szoboszlai.Can’s big moment came a few minutes before half time when he pounced on a half Leipzig clearance from a freekick, pounding the ball into the ground and beyond the unsighted Blaswich, who endured a tough night in the Leipzig goal. Can’s goal proved to be the winner.The former Liverpool and Juventus player is still only 29, even though it feels as though he’s been around a lot longer than that. While he is susceptible to the odd lapse in concentration – his misjudgement let in Christopher Nkunku for a one-on-one in the seventh minute – his experience is exactly what makes him such an asset to Terzic. Can could be seen coaching the less experience Jamie Bynoe-Gittens and Julian Ryerson through the final stages.In this kind of form, Dortmund’s title credentials are growing stronger by the week. If anyone is going to prise Bayern’s hands off the Meisterschale it’s surely the Black and Yellows, who make the short trip to Gelsenkirchen next for a Ruhr Derby in which they will be overwhelming favorites to win again. This felt like a big night in their title charge. April 1’s Klassiker could be pivotal.",2023/03/03,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4826708,Final verdict on Belgium-Iran prisoner swap treaty could free Belgian aid worker,"Belgium's top court has given a conditional green light to a controversial prisoner swap treaty with Iran.The legislation was passed in July last year in an effort to secure the release of Belgian aid worker Olivier Vandecasteele, imprisoned in Iran on espionage charges Belgium says are fabricated. However, the treaty was slammed by some parliamentarians, Iranian dissidents, and critics of the regime in Tehran, who feared it would lead to the release of Assadollah Assadi — an Iranian diplomat convicted of a terror plot.Belgium's Constitutional Court has now ruled that the treaty can go ahead, but said in its judgment that the victims of the prisoner the government intends to exchange must be informed of the transfer, in turn giving them the chance to mount a legal challenge.""This is a good day for democracy in Belgium because the judicial authorities of this country took account of all the arguments … to say that, in fact, this treaty is constitutional. There’s no doubt: the Constitutional Court recognises that the treaty can enter into force,"" Vandecasteele's best friend Olivier Van Steirtegem told Belgian broadcaster LN24 after the judgement.In a phone call with the Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi on March 1, Belgium's Prime Minister Alexander De Croo pushed for Vandecasteele's release.""My message was very clear: Olivier Vandecasteele is an innocent man and must be released immediately.In the meantime, his inhuman conditions of detention must change,"" he said in a tweet.Vandecasteele, a 42-year-old former aid worker, was arrested and imprisoned in Tehran in February 2022. He was sentenced to 40 years behind bars earlier this year.Van Steirtegem has been campaigning for his friend ever since. A petition demanding Vandecasteele's release currently has more than 73,000 signatures.Out of 131 Belgian parliamentarians, 79 voted in favor of the prisoner-exchange treaty designed to free him in July 2022, while 41 rejected it and 11 abstained.The move was widely criticized by Iran's political movement in exile, the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), as well as members of the US Congress — Randy K.Weber, Louie Gohmert, and Brian Fitzpatrick — who sent a letter to the Belgian prime minister asking him to oppose the treaty. De Croo rejected accusations he was giving in to ""blackmail.""A case calling for the treaty to be annulled was lodged in Belgium's top court last year.Prisoner swaps often take place between autocracies and democracies when the latter is keen to bring their citizens home, and the former is keen to use this tactic to achieve political goals.While the US, UK, and other nations have engaged in prisoner-exchange treaties to address similar suspected cases of hostage diplomacy, Belgian-Iranian parliamentarian Darya Safai  — who has herself been imprisoned in Iran  — believes that prisoner swaps will not work with Tehran.""If Belgium appeases the regime in Iran in this manner, we are sending across a message that we are weak and are ready to give them what they want,"" she told DW in an interview last September.After Friday's judgment, Van Steirtegem told Belgian broadcaster LN24 that ""attempts to find all possible arguments that could be found in all possible elements of Belgian law must stop.""He told DW Vandecasteele's life was at stake right now.""Since his arrest a year ago, his health has been deteriorating and he is also in solitary confinement, which means he is in a cell two meters by three, with a hole in the cell to go to the toilet. There is a light which is constantly on, and there is no heating. He has nobody to talk to and cannot even meet his lawyers. We need to get him released soon,"" he said.Nassim Papayianni, senior campaigner on Iran at Amnesty International, told DW that while Vandecasteele's release was important, Assadi being released earlier would also represent a risk for Iranian dissidents abroad.“The international community, including Belgium and other European governments need to fulfill their obligations under international law, to duly punish attempted extrajudicial executions, other crimes under international law, and other unlawful acts committed by the Iranian authorities extraterritorially, to crush freedom of expression and peaceful dissent,"" she said.But Iranian human rights lawyer and former head of public interestl law at Oxford University Kaveh Moussavi told DW that ""Assadi is not going anywhere just yet.""""The court makes it clear that any prisoner exchange shall be subject to individual judicial supervision in which the rights of the victims have to be judicially evaluated. It is much like a parole process,"" he said. ""So if this takes place, then the prisoner exchange can take place.""Moussavi added that the decision is not the end of legal remedies. ""It is still possible for the NCRI to appeal the decision at the European Court of Justice. So the judicial process is not yet over,"" he said.Vandecasteele's family say there may still be a long way to go to free him. But in a tweet published on the ""Free Olivier Vandecasteele"" account after Friday's ruling, they say ""there might finally be a light at the end of the tunnel!""Edited by: Maren Sass",2023/03/03,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4826709,Bakhmut: What will be the outcome of the battle?,"Bakhmut is of great strategic importance to both the Ukrainian and the Russian forces, says Marina Miron, a research fellow at the Centre for Military Ethics at King's College London. Miron believes that, if Russian troops capture the city, they will advance further, perhaps toward Kramatorsk.""They would control important roads, cutting off the Ukrainian armed forces and making the defense much harder for them,"" says Miron. She warns that this would also undermine the morale of the Ukrainian troops, and could lead to Western partners losing confidence in the capabilities of the Ukrainian army.Ralph Thiele, a retired German colonel who has served on the personal staff of NATO's Supreme Allied Commander Europe, agrees. ""The Ukrainian side is basically compelled — also by its Western partners — to deliver successes. There has to be some sort of constant public justification for the huge amount of support being given to Ukraine,"" says Thiele.He also emphasizes the psychological importance of defending Bakhmut. ""People must somehow be motivated to hang in there. That is a signal that goes out to the whole of Ukraine — to the civilian population, as well as to soldiers in other places,"" Thiele says. The amount of effort the two sides are putting into conquering and defending the city is not really justifiable, he adds.Mike Martin, a researcher at King's College London, says Russia is persisting in its efforts to capture Bakhmut because it corresponds to Putin's stated war aim of, in his words, ""liberating the Donbas."" Martin explains: ""If you look at the way the roads and the rail networks are arranged, there are two bigger settlements to the west of Bakhmut, but still in the Donbas: Sloviansk and Kramatorsk. And in order to take those bigger cities, which he needs to do to complete his strategic goal, he needs to take Bakhmut first.""In Ralph Thiele's estimation, Ukraine is less likely to win the battle for Bakhmut. The Russian army has already encircled the city. ""There's a small strip four kilometers wide that's still accessible for people to flee, or to bring in reinforcements and supplies. But four kilometers is nothing, and the Russians are positioned all around it in a horseshoe formation, and they're trying to push the ends of this horseshoe together.""Thiele adds that the Russians also outnumber the Ukrainians near Bakhmut. ""If we look at the overall situation, we see that there is far more on the Russian side, be it armored vehicles, tanks, artillery or planes,"" he says. The Ukrainians, meanwhile, are still waiting for Western military aid to arrive.As far as aid is concerned, Thiele is not very optimistic. ""When we see that the whole of Europe produces less ammunition for Ukraine in a month than Russia uses in a day, we can see how difficult it's going to be to get them the support they need.""He points out that the issue of tanks is also very difficult. ""In public debate, people keep saying 'yes' to tanks. But the tanks have to get there somehow. They have to be driven there, but many of the bridges can't bear that weight. So it's difficult to get them there. If a tank breaks down or requires maintenance, it can't be done on the spot; it may have to be driven back 900 kilometers to Poland or Slovakia.""Markus Reisner, a colonel in the Austrian army, comments: ""Success in Bakhmut would mean the Russians would effectively succeed in occupying another piece of land. But that would not mean a breakthrough into the heart of the territory, because they will come up against the next line of defense."" He says that, following successful campaigns near Kharkiv and Kherson, Ukraine decided relatively quickly to launch a third offensive, from Zaporizhzhia toward Melitopol, but that pressure on the Ukrainian forces near Bakhmut has meant Kyiv has had to keep redeploying forces there.According to Reisner, the Ukrainian army is currently preparing eight brigades and looking for a suitable place to launch an offensive. This could be in the region north of Melitopol. If successful, it could cut Russian forces off from Crimea, and those near Zaporizhzhia and Kherson could be cut off from the supply line across the Crimean bridge. ""The Russians would then have very different concerns, namely how to supply their units in the region, rather than how to continue attacking in Donbas,"" says Reisner.However, Gustav Gressel, a fellow of the European Council on Foreign Relations who specializes in Russia and defense policy, believes that now is not the right time for a Ukrainian counteroffensive. ""If you want to mount a counteroffensive, you have to assemble capabilites away from the frontline and the fighting, and then organize them for an attack. That would be risky at this stage,"" he says. ""Even if Ukraine pushes through Russian lines and expands its control, the Russians would still have strong reserves and a large number of troops they can throw into the battle."" These, he explains, could be used to man lines in the rear, or to attack the Ukrainians from several directions at once.""If we wait a few months until the Russian offensive potential is exhausted, and Russia starts to eat up its reserves to fuel the current offensive, then Ukrainian forces will have more room to expand their control as soon as they have penetrated the Russian front,"" Gressel believes. ""That way, they can liberate more terroritory with the same amount of losses, and with the same amount of vehicles used.""""Everyone has an interest in this war coming to an end now, and of course there is pressure on both sides — especially on Ukraine, and perhaps now also on Russia through India and China,"" says Ralph Thiele. However, he believes that when people talk of ""defeating Russia,"" this is ""just a turn of phrase."" Russia still has the capacity to greatly escalate the war — and not just with nuclear weapons. ""This includes hypersonic weapons, which we don't even notice, but which make it possible for Putin to place a bomb on every desk in the world, without us being able to defend ourselves against it,"" Thiele warns.He says it is now the West's job to prevent an escalation. ""We must see how we can convince him to back down. That would essentially be done by those who support him, which would be China or India, Saudi Arabia, Brazil and South Africa. That's a large group, and they could really pressure Russia."" As for Ukraine, Thiele says every military success would help to strengthen its position before a ceasefire.As for the likely course of the war in the near future, Mike Martin of King's College London does not believe a lack of soldiers would be a reason for Ukraine to stop resisting. ""I think the stopping point for this war for the Ukrainians will either be when they win, or when the West stops supplying them with weapons,"" he says.This article was originally written in Russian.",2023/03/03,,

(TSXV: FHYD) (OTC Pink: FHYDF) (FSE: FIT) (""FIRST HYDROGEN"" or the ""Company"") reveals new images outlining the vision for its Generation II concept vehicle, which will be available with either fuel cell electric or battery electric drive trains. The latest sketches show the design process that the Company is undertaking with global mobility experts EDAG Group.The images show the vehicle's overall form in greater detail and indicate some of the van's technical assets. As well as the vertical taillights and branded daytime running lights, which were revealed earlier this year, the new illustrations exhibit an aerodynamic fuselage. They also show muscular and dynamic fenders and a large front grill, which is both functional and stylish. Incorporating First Hydrogen branding, the grill provides the necessary ventilation for the vehicle's front located fuel cell.Vehicle sketchesTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/8330/157201_figure1.jpgThe Generation II concepts are being developed while First Hydrogen trials its Generation I fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEV).  Launched last year, the Generation I vehicles are currently undergoing mileage accumulation and evaluation before entering trials with major fleet operators in the UK.  The road trials for Generation I are managed in conjunction with the UK Aggregated Hydrogen Freight Consortium (AHFC).  Members cover a variety of sectors including grocery, roadside assistance, utilities, construction and express delivery and trial participants will use First Hydrogen's demonstrator vehicles alongside their existing fleets to evaluate the benefits of different vehicle technologies.  Data and feedback gained during these trials will influence the design and engineering of the Company's future vehicles to ensure designs meet customer needs.The global light commercial vehicle market is projected to reach USD 751.86 billion by 2030, increasing at a compound annual growth rate of 5.1% during the forecast period (2022-2030).  Further growth is expected as industries strive to meet zero emission targets and governments incentivise switching to zero emission mobility and invest in better infrastructure.  First Hydrogen is targeting the commercial van market and light commercial vehicle sector to support fleet operators to move away from fossil fuels and invest in zero emission transport.Steve Gill, CEO of Automotive for First Hydrogen, says: ""We are delighted to present a first look at the new concept vehicle and are proud of its clean, functional, and modern design. The aerodynamic design and overall proportions have been shaped to consider operations on highways and in urban environments. We have taken a particular focus on the lighting, ensuring high visibility for drivers and other road users, – this is especially important for use by delivery, utilities, and roadside assistance companies – but also make the vehicles instantly recognisable as First Hydrogen.""Bernat Costa, Design Director at EDAG Spain, comments: ""We have taken great care to reflect the modern and clean energy values First Hydrogen represents in the vehicle design. The pure and minimalist design meets functional needs and accommodates the technical requirements of hydrogen propulsion. We have also created a design suited to modular builds, providing operational flexibility through a range of sizes and potential bespoke elements.""About First Hydrogen Corp.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4826775,"Scientists say ancient Europeans rode horses 5,000 years ago","A group of international researchers on Friday said they believe to have compelling evidence that ancient Europeans were riding horses 5,000 years ago.The team from the University of Helsinki and other European institutions made the claim after examining more than 200 human skeletons in museum collections in Bulgaria, Poland, Romania, Hungary and the Czech Republic.The team's findings, published in the journal Science Advances, claimed skeletal signs of what scientists call ""horsemanship syndrome."" These are recognized in six tell-tale markers indicating a person was likely regularly riding an animal — including characteristic wear marks on the hip sockets, thigh bones and pelvis, as well as stress-induced vertebral degeneration.""If you sit on horseback you need to balance with every step of your mount, you need to cling tightly with your legs,"" said Martin Trautmann, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Helsinki.He said such morphology is pronounced as ""saddles and stirrups dated much later,"" adding that early riders likely rode bareback and gripped the mane of the horse.""Our findings provide a strong argument that horseback riding was already a common activity for some Yamnaya individuals as early as 3000 B.C.""Archaeologist Volker Heyd of the University of Helsinki said the find ""fits very nicely into the overall picture"" of the Yamnaya, a Bronze Age culture known for its burial mounds, or ""kurgans,"" and originating from the Pontic Caspian steppe in what is now Ukraine and western Russia.Researchers long suspected the Yamnaya used horses as that would explain the culture's rapid geographical expansion over the course of just a few generations.""It is difficult to envision how this expansion could have taken place without improved means of transport,"" researchers said. ""Using horses for transport was a decisive step in human cultural development.""""The spread of Indo-European languages is linked to their movement, and they reshaped the genetic make-up of Europe,"" said archaeologist Heyd.Researchers said it is unlikely that the Yamnaya were a warrior people.""They were cowboys, not warriors,"" said Martin Trautman.The team is convinced that only a small number of individuals would have been riders who ""were probably helping the Yamnaya people in guarding their animals, their cattle and sheep mostly.""Though scientists had previously found evidence that horses may have been domesticated for their milk around 3500-3000 BC, Friday's publishings are the first to suggest evidence of the origins of horseback riding.The researchers involved in the report say the earliest clues to horseback riding are depictions from the Mesopotamian Ur III period (shortly before 2000 BC). The activity was also written about and visually depicted in the Old Babylonian period from 1880-1595 BC.js/sms (AFP, AP)",2023/03/04,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4826792,"Wall Street closes sharply higher, notches weekly gains as Treasury yields ease","NEW YORK, March 3 (Reuters) - Wall Street rallied on Friday to end a volatile week, as U.S. Treasury yields eased and economic data helped investors look past the growing likelihood that the Federal Reserve will have to keep its restrictive policy in place until late in the year.
All three major U.S. stock indexes surged more than 1%, with the tech-laden Nasdaq climbing close to 2% with a boost from interest rate sensitive megacaps. U.S. Treasury yields eased in the wake of comments from Fed officials that calmed fears over inflation and interest rates.
""It continues to be all about the Fed and how gracefully they can slow the economy,"" said David Carter, managing director at JPMorgan Private Bank in New York. ""The Fed is telling markets what they want to hear but also injecting the caution that rates may need to go higher depending on the economic data.""
For the week, the indexes notched gains, with the S&P snapping a three-week losing streak and the Dow, returning to positive territory year-to-date, enjoyed its first weekly advance since late January.
The week also saw the benchmark S&P 500 break through its 50- and 200-day moving averages, two closely watched technical levels.
""It’s an indication that a shift is transpiring,"" said Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth in Fairfield, Connecticut. ""And a lot of people are suspect of it, but they don't want to be left behind.""
Economic data released on Friday showed steady demand for services, with purchasing managers' indexes (PMI) from the Institute for Supply Management and S&P Global indicating that activity in the sector continues to expand even as input prices cool.
""Investors saw what they wanted in the ISM data, which was basically healthy growth with slowing prices,"" Carter added. ""It suggests they are willing to stay on the plane as they are less worried about the landing.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 387.4 points, or 1.17%, to 33,390.97, the S&P 500 (.SPX) gained 64.29 points, or 1.61%, to 4,045.64 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) added 226.02 points, or 1.97%, to 11,689.01.
All 11 major sectors of the S&P 500 ended the session green, with tech (.SPLRCT) and consumer discretionary (.SPLRCD) enjoying the largest percentage gains.
Fourth-quarter earnings season is on the final stretch, with all but seven of the companies in the S&P 500 having reported. Results for the quarter have beaten consensus estimates 68% of the time, according to Refinitiv.
Still, on aggregate, analysts believe S&P 500 earnings will have fallen 3.2% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year, and expect negative year-on-year numbers for the first two quarters of 2023. This would imply the S&P 500 entered a three-quarter earnings recession in the closing months of 2022, per Refinitiv.
Apple Inc (AAPL.O) jumped 3.5% after Morgan Stanley said the stock could rally more than 20% this year on a potential hardware subscription.
Broadcom Inc (AVGO.O) advanced 5.7% after the chipmaker forecast second-quarter revenue above analysts' estimates as increased investments in AI spurred demand for chips.
Among losers, Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) slipped 2.1% on the heels of its revenue miss, as high inflation dampened consumer demand.
Chipmaker Marvell Technology Inc (MRVL.O) slid 4.7% in the wake of the company's quarterly profit miss and disappointing revenue forecast.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 4.54-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.36-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 23 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 79 new highs and 57 new lows.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4826797,"First evidence for horseback riding dates back 5,000 years","WASHINGTON (AP) — Archaeologists have found the earliest direct evidence for horseback riding – an innovation that would transform history – in 5,000 year old human skeletons in central Europe.“When you get on a horse and ride it fast, it’s a thrill – I’m sure ancient humans felt the same way,” said David Anthony, a co-author of the study and Hartwick College archaeologist. “Horseback riding was the fastest a human could go before the railroads.”Researchers analyzed more than 200 Bronze Age skeletal remains in museum collections in Bulgaria, Poland, Romania, Hungary and the Czech Republic to look for signs of what co-author and University of Helsinki anthropologist Martin Trautmann calls “horse rider syndrome” – six tell-tale markers that indicate a person was likely riding an animal, including characteristic wear marks on the hip sockets, thigh bone and pelvis.“You can read bones like biographies,” said Trautmann, who has previously studied similar wear patterns in skeletons from later periods when horseback riding is well-established in the historical record.The researchers focused on human skeletons — which are more readily preserved than horse bones in burial sites and museums – and identified five likely riders who lived around 4,500 to 5,000 years ago and belonged to a Bronze Age people called the Yamnaya.“There is earlier evidence for harnessing and milking of horses, but this is the earliest direct evidence so far for horseback riding,” said University of Exeter archaeologist Alan Outram, who was not involved in the research, but praised the approach.The study was published Friday in the journal Science Advances.Domesticating wild horses on the plains of Eurasia was a process, not a single event, the researchers say.Archaeologists have previously found evidence of people consuming horse milk in dental remains and indications of horses controlled by harnesses and bits dating back more than 5,000 years, but that does not necessarily indicate the horses were ridden.The Yamnaya culture, known for its characteristic burial mounds, originated in what’s now part of Ukraine and western Russia, an area called the Pontic Caspian steppe. The horses they kept were distinct from modern horses – likely more easily startled and less tolerant of humans – although they may have been the immediate genetic ancestors of modern horses, which emerged a few centuries later, the researchers say.The Yamnaya are most significant because of their dramatic expansion across Eurasia in only a few generations — moving westward to Hungary and eastward to Mongolia, said University of Helsinki archaeologist and co-author Volker Heyd.“The spread of Indo European languages is linked to their movement, and they reshaped the genetic make-up of Europe,” he said.Their relationship with horses may have partly enabled this stunning movement, the researchers suggest. “Horses expand the concept of distance – you begin to think about places previously out of reach as being reachable,” said co-author Anthony, the Hartwick College archaeologist.That does not mean the Yamnaya people were warriors on horseback, as the horses they rode were likely too skittish for stressful battlefield situations, he said. But horses may have allowed the Yamnaya to more effectively send communications, build alliances and manage the herds of cattle that were central to their economy.Because only a small percentage of the skeletons studied clearly showed all six markers of riding horseback, “it seems that a minority of the people at that time were riders – that does not suggest that a whole society was built on horseback riding,” said molecular archaeologist Ludovic Orlando, who is based at the Centre for Anthropobiology and Genomics of Toulouse in France and was not involved in the research.Still, he praised the work for helping to better pinpoint the potential genesis of horseback riding.“This is about the origins of something that impacted human history like only a few other things have,” said Orlando.",2023/03/04,156,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4826798,Amazon pauses construction on 2nd headquarters in Virginia,"NEW YORK (AP) — Amazon is pausing construction of its second headquarters in Virginia following the biggest round of layoffs in the company’s history and its shifting plans around remote work.The Seattle-based company is delaying the beginning of construction of PenPlace, the second phase of its headquarters development in northern Virginia, Amazon’s real estate chief John Schoettler said in a statement. He said the company has already hired more than 8,000 employees and will welcome them to the Met Park campus, the first phase of development, when it opens this June.“We’re always evaluating space plans to make sure they fit our business needs and to create a great experience for employees, and since Met Park will have space to accommodate more than 14,000 employees, we’ve decided to shift the groundbreaking of PenPlace (the second phase of HQ2) out a bit,” Schoettler said.He also emphasized the company remains “committed to Arlington” and the local region, which Amazon picked — along with New York City — to be the site of its new headquarters, known as HQ2, several years ago. More than 230 municipalities had initially competed to house the projects. New York won the competition by promising nearly $3 billion in tax breaks and grants, among other benefits, but opposition from local politicians, labor leaders and progressive activists led Amazon to scrap its plans there.In February 2021, Amazon said it would build an eye-catching, 350-foot Helix tower to anchor the second phase of its redevelopment plans in Arlington. The new office towers were expected to welcome more than 25,000 workers when complete. Amazon spokesperson Zach Goldsztejn said those plans haven't changed and the construction pause is not a result — or indicative of — the company's latest job cuts, which affected 18,000 corporate employees.The layoffs were part of a broader cost-cutting move to trim down Amazon's growing workforce amid more sluggish sales and fears of a potential recession. Meta, Salesforce and other tech companies — many of which had gone on hiring binges in the past few years — have also been doing the same.Amid the job cuts, Amazon has urged its employees to come back to the office. Last month, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said the company would require corporate employees to return to the office at least three days a week, a shift from from the prior policy that allowed leaders to make the call on how their teams worked. The change, which will be effective on May 1, has ignited some pushback from employees who say they prefer to work remotely.Goldsztejn said the company is expecting to move forward with what he called pre-construction work on the construction in Virginia later this year, including applying for permits. He said final timing for the second phase of the project is still being determined.When Virginia won the competition to land HQ2, it did so less with direct incentives, and more with promises to invest in the regional workforce, particularly a graduate campus of Virginia Tech that is under construction just a couple of miles from Amazon’s under-construction campus in Crystal City.Still, there were significant direct incentives. The state promised $22,000 for each new Amazon job on the condition that the average worker salary for those new jobs is $150,000, annually. Those incentives were about $550 million for 25,000 projected jobs.Arlington County also promised Amazon a cut of its hotel-tax revenue on the theory that hotel occupancies would increase significantly once Amazon builds out its campus. That incentive, projected initially at about $23 million, is dependent on how many square feet of office space Amazon occupies in the county.Suzanne Clark, a spokeswoman for the Virginia Economic Development Partnership, said state officials are not concerned about Amazon filling its commitments. The total of 8,000 workers now employed at the new headquarters is already running about 3,000 ahead of what was expected at this point, she said.She said no incentive money has been paid out yet to Amazon. The company is scheduled to submit its first application for payment on April 1, which will be based on the job creation from 2019 through 2022. Amazon would then receive its first grant payment on or after July 1, 2026.In a statement, Democratic U.S. Rep. Don Beyer, who represents the district, called on the company to “promptly update leaders and stakeholders about any new major changes in this project, which remains very important to the capital region.”Arlington County Board Chair Christian Dorsey said during a news briefing Friday that Amazon hasn't earned any of the performance-based incentives and it has not received any funds from the county. He said it’s unclear how long the delay might be, but it's “not really disappointing” since officials there had initially projected the buildout to be completed by 2035. Amazon had previously said it planned to complete the project by 2025.“Amazon is still very much committed — as we understand it — to certainly fulfilling all of their plans and obligations within the window that was envisioned when they struck the deal to come here,” Dorsey said.Dorsey shared the company notified him about the pause in advance of releasing the information to the public. He said Amazon didn't provide a reason for the delay, but it wasn’t challenging to guess it was tied to the economic uncertainty in the county.“They are really trying to take a pause and think about this consciously. And make decisions that not only make sense in light of current conditions but expected future conditions.”",2023/03/04,1444,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4826799,Was ChatGPT generative AI's 'iPhone moment'?,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — When the first-generation iPhone was released by Apple, it was not the first smartphone on the consumer market.Similar devices had been popular since the late '90s, but the iPhone shone a spotlight on the device, pushing it into the mainstream. Shawn Wen (溫宗憲), the Taiwanese co-founder and CEO of a London-based AI company PolyAI, believes that with ChatGPT, generative AI has reached a similar milestone.Speaking on the Startup Island TAIWAN podcast, Wen said that ChatGPT represents a marketing breakthrough more than it does a technological one. “(This helps to) bring people’s attention, bring in more resources, and help the business to grow, so in that way ChatGPT is important,” he said.Kyle Pi (皮克宇), also Taiwanese, and the co-founder and CEO of InstAI agreed, saying that initially he wasn’t impressed by ChatGPT as it did not represent any kind of technological breakthrough. “Architecture and process-wise, there’s not much innovation, so early on I was actually very against it,” he said.“I thought this is just another large language learning model, people spending a lot of money, and then training a toy (to) claim that it can have human emotions,” Pi said. However, he said that once he put on his “business hat,” he realized where the value in the product was.He said he is excited to see what new applications will be found as it continues to learn from human input. “So, with my business hat on, I think it’s really exciting, but with my tech hat, I know what it is, and it’s not rocket science,” Pi saidWen’s company creates realistic voice assistants currently used in the U.K., and said that he would not yet use ChatGPT to generate sentences for customers as it is still too unreliable, though it can be used for other applications. He said that ChaptGPT can summarize the content of the 700 to 1,000 calls his company receives every second, and generate daily reports that help improve the efficacy of the voice assistant in the future.Wen said that while big companies like Google are beginning to look at it, these companies need highly accurate outputs for their services, something that ChatGPT can not yet provide. “(This kind of) information needs to be close to 100% accurate,” he said.“ChatGPT doesn’t guarantee that, in fact, all the generative AI doesn’t guarantee that.”",2023/03/07,550,Business

According to previous rules, cruise passengers had to stay on board during a self-health monitoring period and take quick tests every other day, UDN reported.The Maritime and Port Bureau announced on Saturday this would no longer be necessary, with only travelers showing COVID symptoms such as fever and coughing being asked to take the tests. Other requirements, such as a negative result from a COVID test taken within two days before entering Taiwan, and restrictions on the movements of crew members and staff, had already been scrapped, officials said.If a passenger tested positive during the cruise, they could board any vehicle after disembarking, with the cruise company no longer required to book a special vehicle. Crew members had to take one home test before boarding the ship, with management determining how often staff had to take COVID tests during the voyage.The Maritime and Port Bureau said the new rules were intended to attract more cruises to Taiwan and to help simplify procedures for visitors.",2023/03/04,939,Travel & Cuisine

It argued that authorities were arbitrarily labeling pro-democracy outfits as foreign agents and that they did not have the right to ask for its information.On Saturday, the court ruled that the activists were obliged to answer the notice served to them, and that their refusal to do so was unjustified.Sentencing in the case is expected on March 11 with a maximum jail term of six months for this particular offense.Chow is already serving two other prison terms for unlawful assembly linked to her involvement in organizing Tiananmen commemoration events.Chow and two other former Alliance leaders, Lee Cheuk-yan and Albert Ho, were also charged with inciting subversion of state power under the national security law (NSL) in 2021.Since the imposition of the NSL in the summer of 2020, after months of anti-government protests in Hong Kong, the semi-autonomous city has undergone dramatic changes.Hundreds of pro-democracy politicians, activists and citizens have been arrested.sri/sms (AP, AFP, Reuters)",2023/03/04,,

The two main candidates are the Kuomintang’s (KMT) Lin Ming-chen (林明溱) and the Democratic Progressive Party’s (DPP) Tsai Pei-hui (蔡培慧), who have accused each other of trying to interfere with the election results.Lin said that hidden cameras had been reported outside polling venues, and also made accusations that DPP electoral inspectors were filming voters with their phones. In Taiwan it is illegal to film, broadcast, interfere, or “use mobile phones” to influence voters.Tsai, meanwhile, said that protestors had intimidated her supporters, gathering outside polling stations and chanting “do you want war?” She also said that voters were being recorded.According to CNA, the covert cameras were removed from the election site at Nantou Ying Pan Elementary School polling station, after the public alerted them to them. Four people were subsequently taken by police for questioning.Ordinarily, the Nantou second electoral district would be relatively unimportant on a national scale. However, the election is the first in Taiwan since Lai Ching-te (賴淸德) became the chairman of the DPP, and will be the last held before the 2024 presidential election.Given the DPP’s disastrous results in the 2022 local elections, the Nantou by-election is seen by some as a possible indication of the DPP’s chances of remaining in power in 2024.",2023/03/04,1314,Politics

They also found a 17-year-old named Chen (陳) in the possession of five illegal guns and ammunition.Police transferred the three fugitives to a special detention center for foreigners, while they questioned the youngest man at their station. Social workers were evaluating his situation before handing his case over to a court for a decision, per CNA.Because Wu was also being sought for fraud in the Philippines, his case could be dealt with by a local court, while Chen and Yang might be extradited to Taiwan soon. The fugitives are wanted in Taiwan for kidnapping, fraud, and drug offenses.",2023/03/04,2092,Society

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4826977,Taiwan’s DPP wins legislative by-election in Nantou,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) candidate Tsai Pei-hui (蔡培慧) defeated former Nantou County Commissioner Lin Ming-chen (林明溱) of the Kuomintang (KMT) in a legislative by-election in Nantou County Saturday (March 4).The vote was made necessary by the election of KMT Legislator Hsu Shu-hua (許淑華) as Nantou County commissioner in nationwide regional elections last Nov. 24.

Saturday’s result marked the first victory for the DPP since Vice President Lai Ching-te (賴清德) took over as party chairman in January, following the ruling party’s poor performance in the regional polls. The legislative district, which includes Nantou City and the townships of Zhushan, Mingjian, and Xinyi, was seen as a KMT stronghold.During the counting of the votes after 4 p.m., Tsai established an early lead of about 1,000 votes, but finished almost 2,000 votes ahead, receiving 45,218 votes or 49.44% to Lin’s 43,293 or 47.34%, the Liberty Times reported. Almost half the eligible voters, or 46.35%, actually went to the polls, according to the Central Election Commission (CEC).Earlier in the day, police took in four people for questioning about cameras planted in flowerpots at polling stations, reportedly to record the identity of voters.Lin, who served as legislator for the same seat before being elected county chief in 2014, had been sharply criticized for wanting to return to his old position. During the campaign, his past frequent trips to China at the taxpayers’ expense and the purchase of a house for his son also invited criticism.In another legislative by-election in January, KMT Taipei City Councilor Wang Hung-wei (王鴻薇) defeated DPP candidate Enoch Wu (吳怡農) for the seat vacated by the new mayor of the capital, Chiang Wan-an (蔣萬安).",2023/03/04,1370,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4827029,Russian oil for Indian solidarity: A partnership with mutual benefits,"Russia, an enemy? Not in India, where Russia has long been viewed as a valued political and economic partner. Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year, the relationship has even picked up additional pace. India has declined to join the West's sanctions on Moscow and the country is now importing more crude oil from Russia than ever before. This was one of the driving factors behind the recent official visit to India of German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.According to the Indian Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Russia has become India's fourth largest source of imports in the past year. From April to December 2022, imports totalled $32.8 billion (€30.08 billion), up from $6.58 billion in the same period of 2021.India has bought ""a lot of crude, converted it into refined petroleum products and sold it,"" Indian Commerce Secretary Sunil Barthwal told the Nikkei Asia news outlet.""I would like to clarify we do not ask our companies to buy Russian oil,"" Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar told parliament in December. ""We ask our companies to buy oil [that] is the best option that they can get. Now, it depends on what the market throws up.""As part of global sanctions on Russia, a new price cap has been put on Russian crude oil that came into force on February 5, 2023. For India, the third biggest consumer of oil in the world, this reduction makes a huge difference.This brings multiple benefits for the government. Because India imports more than 80% of its crude oil, the cap means it can lower energy costs. Furthermore, by turning to Russian oil, India can decrease its dependence on the Middle East, which used to be the source of some 60% of the country's oil imports.The economic and political relationship between Russia and India, which are both nuclear powers, is not only based on their mutual interest regarding oil. It also goes back to their long-standing cooperation during the Cold War era.The Soviet Union supplied weapons to India for decades and trained Indian forces in how to use them. India obtained three fifths of its arms from the USSR between 1955 and 1991, analysis by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) shows.According to Air University, an establishment in the US state of Alabama that provides military education for the US Air Force, military cooperation between India and Russia remains significant.""The breadth of Russian-origin platforms in the Indian military ... have created a “lock-in” effect, while the depth of relative support to India’s technology base and strategic systems have engendered a relatively high degree of indebtedness and trust in key strategic circles,"" wrote the authors of a 2021 article for the Journal of Indo-Pacific Affairs.They added that the ""quantity and sensitivity of Russian contributions to the Indian arsenal"" had been largely ""underappreciated.""By contrast, there was a cooler relationship with the United States, which delivered arms to India's enemy Pakistan.Furthermore, for a long time Soviet-type economic planning served as a model for the Indian economy, as it transitioned from colonialism and sought to fight poverty. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, India introduced reforms and opened up its economy to the world.In 2005, under the presidency of George W. Bush, US representatives spoke of India as a ""natural ally"" with ""shared values,"" which would become ""a major world power in the 21st century"" with  US support. It is this aspiration to be a leading global player that explains why India has continued to cooperate with Russia, as part of various institutions, such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), the BRICS bloc (made up of Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) and the Russia-India-China (RIC) grouping, despite its new partnership with the US.""The Russian-Indian partnership will continue,"" Rajan Menon and Eugene Rumer from the US think tank Carnegie Endowment for International Peace wrote in September last year. ""For India, Russia remains an important supplier of weapons. … India has not joined the West's sanctions on Russia. By doing so, it has demonstrated its independent foreign policy,"" they concluded.""Enhancing trade and economic cooperation between India and Russia is a key priority for the political leadership of both the countries,"" the Indian Embassy in Moscow states in a 2022 briefing on India-Russia economic relations.However, it is also partly the case that before the surge of oil imports from Russia, economic cooperation between the two countries had been stagnating at a rather low level, with Russia only rarely making it into the top 25 of India's trading partners between 2012 and 2021.Germany, by comparison, ranked sixth in 2012, but slide down to 11th position in 2021.This article was translated from German.",2023/03/04,,

Russian mercenary leader Yevgeny Prigozhin said on Friday that his forces had almost completely surrounded the town.The minister reportedly listened to a situation report and handed out awards to men and women fighting on the front line.""The awards are deserved and earned, you are fighting properly. A lot of work lies ahead,"" Shoigu said during the ceremony, according to Russian state media.The Russian Defense Ministry has reported previous visits by Shoigu to the front in Ukraine in mid-January and before that two times in December. However, independent analysts later said that, based on video material, Shoigu was in fact some 80 kilometers away from the front during his visits.In contrast, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Commander-in-Chief Valery Zaluzhny and the head of the land forces, Oleksandr Syrskyi, have made regular visits to contested sections of the front line.Here are some of the other notable developments concerning the war in Ukraine on Friday, March 4:The British Ministry of Defence said in its daily intelligence update on Saturday that Ukraine's hold on the strategically important but small town of Bakhmut in Donetsk was being threatened by Russian advances.""The Ukrainian defence of the Donbas town of Bakhmut is under increasingly severe pressure,"" the intelligence report said, adding that due to progress made by the Russian Army and Wagner Group mercenaries, the Ukrainian position was now ""vulnerable to Russian attacks on three sides.""The ministry also reported that two key bridges in Bakhmut had been destroyed in the last 36 hours and that ""Ukrainian-held resupply routes out of the town are increasingly limited.""Audience members at a geopolitical conference in New Delhi burst out laughing after Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that Ukraine began the war against Russia, a claim that the Kremlin has rolled out numerous times.Responding to a question over the effect of the war on Russia's energy strategy, Lavrov said: ""You know the war which we are trying to stop and which was launched against us using the Ukrainian people.""Seemingly caught off guard by the laughter, Lavrov paused briefly before continuing: ""Of course the conflict influenced the policy of Russia, including the energy policy.""India, which was hosting the summit, has maintained good relations with Russia and held a neutral stance on the invasion.Rheinmetall, one of Germany's biggest weapons manufacturers, has been in talks with the Ukrainian government about building a tank factory in Ukraine, German newspaper Rheinische Post reported on Saturday.""For around €200 million ($213 million), a Rheinmetall factory can be built in Ukraine,"" CEO Armin Papperger said, adding that such a facility would be able to produce up to 400 Panther tanks a year.Papperger said that talks with Kyiv had been ""promising"" and that he hoped for a decision ""in the next two months.""Rheinmetall has already made around 250 tanks of various types available for Ukraine, including Marder, Leopard 24A and Leopard 1.Papperger told the Rheinische Post that Ukraine needs between 600 and 800 tanks to defeat Russia, meaning that the production of new tanks must begin quickly. ""Even if Germany were to hand over all of its available 300 Leopard 2 tanks, it would be nowhere near enough.""The CEO said that Ukraine has received enough weapons to defend itself, but not to win back territory taken by Russian forces. He also predicted the war would last ""probably for years.""Rheinmetall has seen its value more than double since Russia launched its full-scale invasion last year.ab/fb (AFP, dpa, Reuters, AP)",2023/03/04,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4827031,Philippines: Governor killed in latest politician assault,"Six gunmen on Saturday opened fire as a local politician was meeting villagers in the central Philippines, killing the lawmaker, Negros Oriental Governor Roel Degamo, and five of his constituents, police said.The shooting in the town of Pamplona is the latest in a series of high-profile attacks on local officials.The gunmen, who were reportedly dressed in uniforms similar to those worn by the armed services, opened fire with assault rifles at Degamo's home after alighting from a convoy, local police said.Following the attack, which occurred as villagers had gathered in front of Degamo's house to seek cash and medical aid, the gunmen fled and later abandoned three SUVs, police said.Police said they were searching for 10 suspects, including the six gunmen.Negros Oriental province has a history of violent political rivalries.Degamo, 56, had recently been declared the rightful winner of the election for the provincial governorship following a recount lost by his local rival, who had previously been proclaimed the victor.President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. condemned the mid-morning attack, saying in a statement: ""My government will not rest until we have brought the perpetrators of this dastardly and heinous crime to justice.""He said that authorities already had ""much information and now have a clear direction on how to proceed to bring to justice those behind this killing.""Degamo's widow, Janice Degamo, who is also the mayor of Pamplona, said in a Facebook video: ""Governor Degamo did not deserve that kind of death. He was serving his constituents on a Saturday.""Governor Mamintal Alonto Adiong Jr. of southern Lanao del Sur province was wounded and four of his bodyguards killed after gunmen attacked their convoy last month.Another recent highway ambush killed the vice mayor of the northern town of Aparri, Rommel Alameda, along with five companions.President Marcos, who took office in June last year, is facing inherited challenges posed by widespread criminality, decadeslong Muslim and communist rebellions and other security concerns.tj/fb (AFP, AP)",2023/03/04,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4827032,Malaysia: Deadly floods force mass evacuations,"Several states in Malaysia's south have been hit by massive floods amid the country's monsoon season, with more than 41,000 people forced to flee their homes across the region.Officials say the floods, which have caused at least four fatalities in the past week, are some of the most severe ever to hit the country.The southern state of Johor, which borders Singapore, is the worst-hit of six Malaysian states affected by the flooding.Almost 40,000 people have left their homes in the state to seek refuge from the rising waters, and more than 1,000 were forced to evacuate in five other states. Authorities have set up more than 200 relief shelters for displaced people, according to the national disaster management agency.Relief efforts in Johor and elsewhere have been hampered by the torrential rain, which has flooded roads, submerged cars, damaged homes and caused many shops to close.Police said at least four people had died since Wednesday. The fatalities include a man whose car was swept away by floodwaters and an elderly couple who drowned.They said the latest fatality was a 68-year-old woman who drowned near her flooded house after leaving an evacuation center in the town of Segamat in Johor.Floods are common in Malaysia during the annual monsoon season between October and March and often cause mass evacuations and deaths.However, some environmental officials have said the current flooding is unusual in its intensity and have blamed climate change and human activities for playing a role in the disaster.The president of the Malaysian Nature Society, Vincent Chow, told the French AFP news agency that the floods were the worst to hit Johor since 1969.""Now, the weather is unpredictable. Climate change has outfoxed the weatherman,"" he said.Meenakshi Raman, the president of the environmental group Friends of the Earth Malaysia, also suggested in comments to the news agency that the large scale of the flooding was partly down to humans.""Forest and land clearings in the upper reaches of our rural areas, towns and cities lead to our rivers and drains chocked with soil erosion, and they cannot contain the increased volumes of rainfall,"" she said.""The over-concretizing of areas also leads to overflows of water, as there is little green left to act as sponges,"" she added.The Meteorological Department has warned that the rain could go on until April.tj/fb (AFP, Reuters)",2023/03/04,,

Dlamini was scheduled to meet with President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) and Premier Chen Chien-jen (陳建仁), MOFA said.Visits to Taiwanese companies investing in Eswatini and to the Hsinchu Science Park were on the delegation’s agenda, as the African country was developing its own Royal Science and Technology Park.MOFA praised Eswatini for its frequent public support for Taiwan at international events such as the United Nations General Assembly and the World Health Assembly, and pointed out Dlamini had often represented his country to defend Taiwan’s cause.",2023/03/04,737,Politics

A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than March 7, 2023. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually handle securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, defendants overstated Enovix's ability to produce batteries at scale, touting the Company's ""meaningful progress"" in scaling up its manufacturing facility, and its being positioned to deliver batteries ahead of competitions, despite its continued manufacturing issues.To join the Enovix class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=10931  or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email pkim@rosenlegal.com or cases@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor's ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.Follow us for updates on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-rosen-law-firm, on Twitter: https://twitter.com/rosen_firm or on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/rosenlawfirm/.Attorney Advertising.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4827116,Avant-garde pioneer artist Mary Bauermeister has died,"Mary Bauermeister died on March 2 at the age of 88, as confirmed by her son Simon Stockhausen to German press agency dpa.She was considered the ""mother of the Fluxus movement,"" which broke with tradition, using Dadaist means to, bring everyday life into art. Yet, for Bauermeister, who was born on September 7, 1934 in Frankfurt, this categorization did not make sense.""Fluxus didn't even exist at the end of the 1950s,"" she said in an interview in 2018. The term was not in circulation until 1963, when Fluxus festivals were being held in Düsseldorf and other cities across Germany. By then, Bauermeister had already become a star in the US.Before that she spent time in Cologne where she moved to at the age of 22 after studying art in Ulm and Saarbrücken.The city with the famous cathedral had been cleared of rubble and was in the midst of the ""economic miracle.""Women had been given equal rights by law.A trailblazer who disregarded norms, the young woman declared nature to be the material for her art, breaking with all prevailing genre boundaries.In her famous ""lens boxes,"" dome-shaped pieces of glass, magnifying lenses and prisms merged together to form optically-distorted images and words that appeared to be magical structures.Bauermeister soon became involved with the New Music scene in the Rhineland. Her attic apartment in the heart of the historical part of Cologne also served as her studio, and developed into a meeting place for the international art and music avant-garde. Composers such as John Cage, David Tudor and La Monte Young gave their first concerts there at Bauermeister's invitation.The public West German broadcaster WDR, with its radio station and renowned studio for electronic music, was a magnet for musicians from all over the world.The International Society for New Music (IGNM) hosted a festival in the city. In the evenings, after various WDR events, an international audience and artists from all over Europe and the US would gather in Bauermeister's studio, where a ""counter-festival"" would be held, featuring many artists who had been rejected by the official IGNM jury.Between March 1960 and October 1961, legendary exhibitions also took place in Bauermeister's apartment in addition to concerts. Fluxus stars such as Wolf Vostell, Nam June Paik and Christo performed and/or exhibited their works in the ""Bauermeister Studio."" The ""Light Ballet"" by Zero artist Otto Piene premiered with Bauermeister's support. Her studio was a hub of creativity and free thought.""All the greats slept on my mattresses — John Cage, Christo, writer Hans G. Helms, pianist David Tudor and Korean composer Nam June Paik, who is regarded as the inventor of video art,"" Bauermeister, who was active through her old age, recalled in an interview. What she shared with her companions was a zest for improvisation.She said her perspective on life had been formed in reaction to Germany's National Socialist past: ""People murdering Jews during the day while listening to Beethoven in the evening made us suspicious. So, we loved everything that was radical and broke with the past,"" she said.Baumeister not only played host in a male-dominated avant-garde movement, but also continually developed her own installations made of mirrors, sculptures made of fluorescent tubes or ""writing pictures."" She created spirals of polished pebbles, which made her famous in the US in the 60s. She also experimented with patched sheets that she mounted on light boxes. Ciphers, signs and text fragments from science, philosophy and mathematics, music and art formed the basis for her drawings, collages and objects.During a composition course in Darmstadt, Bauermeister met the composer Karlheinz Stockhausen. In 1962, they displayed their works together in Amsterdam — it was Bauermeister's first museum exhibition. A year later, she moved to New York, where  her prisms and lens boxes sold at top prices in galleries. A closer look at her glass spheres reveals notes by John Cage or her own autobiographical texts.Bauermeister married Karlheinz Stockhausen in 1967. Before that, the two lived for several years under one roof with Stockhausen's first wife Doris in a menage-a-trois. Bauermeister had two of her four children with Stockhausen.She later wrote a book entitled ""Ich hänge im Triolengitter: Mein Leben mit Karlheinz Stockhausen"" (Hanging in a Triplet Grid: My Life with Karlheinz Stockhausen) about this time. It was published in 2011.While the Museum of Modern Art in New York exhibited Baumeister's works in the 1990s, Germany was for a long time more hesitant. She was only rediscovered in her home country a few years ago. Now, her works are exhibited in German museums.Baumeister continued to work in her house near Cologne, creating geometric shapes in the form of snails and pyramids from stones that had been smoothed by the sea. She also  created pictures made of delicately arranged bits of straw, painted over with phosphorus paint, a technique she had begun to employ back in 1958. In her house in Forsbach, she regularly held Sunday matinees in which she talked to interested people about her eventful life.This article was originally written in German.",2023/03/04,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4827131,Spanish PM Sanchez announces planned gender-parity law,"Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has announced a plan to pass new legislation to require a more equal representation of women in political, business and public fields.Sanchez was speaking during a rally held by his Socialist Party (PSOE) in Madrid on Saturday. The Equal Representation Law will be up for Cabinet approval on Tuesday ahead of International Women's Day on March 8.The prime minister described the left-wing coalition government's plan as ""not only taking a step in favor of feminism, but in favor of Spanish society as a whole.""The law will demand that listed companies with more than 250 employees and an annual turnover of over €50 million (roughly $53 million) assign women to at least 40% of management roles.Women lawmakers currently make up 44% of Congress and 39% of the Senate. The proposed law will require that these are both brought up to 50% with parties obliged to put up an equal number of male and female candidates to stand during elections.It will apply to elections at all levels, from municipal votes to the European Parliament.Professional associations and juries that give out awards financed with public money will also have to make sure women make up at least 40% of their boards.""This Tuesday we will break the glass ceiling forever,"" Sanchez said. ""No step backward in the defense of equality.""The leftist coalition government, which includes PSOE and Podemos (We Can), has driven through a series of laws establishing equality measures.The parliament passed legislation in February boosting transgender rights, easing access to abortion and granting menstrual leave to women suffering from severe period pain.The coalition government has come under pressure for another law — the Sexual Consent Law or the ""Only Yes Means Yes Law"" — which sought to help victims of sexual assault but has inadvertently resulted in more than 700 offenders having their sentences reduced on technicalities, as well as 74 being released early.PSOE is hoping to close the loophole, but Podemos says the problem lies with conservative judges misinterpreting the law and argues that any change would mean backpedaling on progress.ab/msh (Reuters, EFE, dpa)",2023/03/04,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4827144,German abortion clinics targeted by US-style protests,"In the early afternoon on a gray and windy Friday in February, a dozen protesters from EuroProLife slowly began to appear opposite the Pro Familia family planning advice and counseling center in Frankfurt's Westend.Clutching hymn sheets and rosaries, they chanted the Hail Mary prayer. Some held placards bearing images of smiling babies or a tiny clenched fist with the slogans ""Unborn Lives Matter"" and ""Abortion Is Not a Solution.""The demonstration was held by 40 Days for Life, a movement that originated in the US state of Texas in 2004. It calls on protesters to hold so-called ""vigils"" outside of abortion facilities for 40 days beginning on Ash Wednesday to coincide with Lent.The protesters say they don't wish to talk to the media. They say they have been unfairly portrayed by the press, and that their words have been misreported and turned against them. They simply want to pray in peace, they say.Claudia Hohmann has been the director of the Pro Familia center in Frankfurt for nine years. She remembers the day in 2017 when protesters first appeared on the normally quiet square close to the entrance of the city's botanical gardens.""It was a real shock,"" Hohmann says. ""I'm sure there are women who aren't so affected by it, but there are individuals who carry that [experience] with them into counseling and are then less open to talking. The situation outside simply fuels feelings of shame and guilt.""Under Section 218 of the German Criminal Code, abortion is illegal, but it is possible up to 12 weeks after conception only if a counseling certificate is obtained at least three days before the procedure. Without this certificate, any woman who has an abortion is liable to prosecution, as is the doctor who performs the procedure.Pro Familia has branches in cities throughout Germany and is certified to issue the required certificates. The office in Frankfurt offers counseling to around 1,700 pregnant people each year.Hohmann says that protests not only have a psychological impact on those visiting the center — where the singing and prayers by protesters can be heard inside the building — but people are also becoming too intimidated to seek counseling.""Freedom of speech is all well and good,"" Hohmann told DW. ""Just not here. It's very targeted and that's what is so perfidious about it.""The activists outside the counseling center call the protests ""vigils"" and, Hohmann says, are careful to portray themselves as peaceful demonstrators simply expressing an opinion.""Of course, we're glad that they don't shout at us or throw things at us, but that's not the point. It's a friendliness behind which lies a lot of aggression towards people,"" Hohmann says.According to Germany's Statistical Office, around 100,000 abortions are performed each year in the country, down from 130,899 in 1996. In some parts of Germany, it can be difficult for those seeking an abortion to find a clinic — in some cities there are none.Medical schools do not always teach the procedure, and fewer and fewer graduates want to work in this area of healthcare. At the same time, the doctors who do provide the service are often older and are going into retirement. Between 2003 and 2020, the number of clinics offering abortion services fell 50% to only 1109.Dutch gynecologist Gabie Raven became troubled by the increasing numbers of Germans crossing the border to get an abortion at her clinics in the Netherlands and decided to open a clinic in the western German city of Dortmund in November last year.She was immediately targeted by anti-abortion protestors, who called her a ""baby murderer."" Her address and telephone number were quickly published on anti-abortion websites.""I took part in a TV program [for Franco-German public broadcaster ARTE] about the history of abortion and I think the 'Pro-Life' groups saw it and started saying that I am the most evil doctor in Germany,"" Raven told DW.""There's a Bible Belt here, just like in Holland, and they say they have no problems with abortion — but we all know that's not true. It was really hard for us to find premises to lease, I think, because we wanted to perform abortions,"" Raven says.Protests outside of abortion clinics and family planning centers are common in the United States, where abortion is a highly partisan and dominant political issue. Planned Parenthood, which provides reproductive healthcare and advice at centers throughout the US, even has guidelines on its website for patients on how to deal with protestors gathered outside of its centers.Although less widespread and less well-publicized than those in the US, anti-abortion protests outside counseling centers and abortion clinics are not a new phenomenon in Germany. But they have increased in scale and intensity in recent years.Ulli Jentsch is a journalist who works at the Berlin-based Anti-Fascist Press Archive and Education Center (apabiz) and has been researching the extreme right, Christian fundamentalism and the ""Pro-Life"" movement in Germany for more than 20 years. He says that the anti-abortion movement in the US has been a role model for activists in Germany and Europe since at least the 1990s.""Apart from trying to copy US-style tactics, there are also the contacts,"" Jentsch told DW. He points to Terrisa Bukovinac, a prominent US anti-abortion activist who was a guest speaker at the annual ""March for Life"" anti-abortion demo in Berlin in September 2022.During her speech, Bukovinac, a self-declared atheist and left-leaning progressive, called abortion a ""global genocide"", telling the crowd: ""It is so amazing to be here today to stand in solidarity with all of you and with the unborn victims of the global abortion industrial complex.""According to Jentsch, right-wing conservative think tanks in the US are also pouring money — and expertise — into expanding their own ideologically aligned organizations in Europe and around the world.The aim is to import the successful US ""litigation model"", where with a lot of legal know-how and financial backing, contentious cases are brought before the courts in the hope of setting a legal precedent far more restrictive than constitutionally intended.""They are very active and well funded, and this work wouldn't be possible without funding from the US,"" Jentsch says. ""They use the money to support certain cases, for example at the European Court of Human Rights, and they've also supported cases pertaining to the 'vigils'. They are in Strasbourg [the seat of the European Parliament], in Brussels [where the EU is headquartered], sitting at the interface where policymaking takes place, and that is their great strength.""The Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) is a conservative Christian legal advocacy group founded in the US in 1993. Lawyers from ADF's international arm supported the organizer of the ""40 Days for Life"" protest group Pavica Vojnovic in her case against the municipal government in the German city of Pforzheim after it banned protestors from gathering outside of the Pro Familia center there. Vojnovic launched a legal challenge against the ban and eventually won her case at the Administrative Court in Mannheim in August last year.When the protests first started outside of Pro Familia in Frankfurt in 2017, the Interior Ministry in the state of Hesse introduced guidelines ordering protesters to gather out of sight and earshot of the counseling and advice center. For one year, the protesters moved to the main road about 100 meters away.Anti-abortion group Euro Pro-Life filed a legal challenge to the order, arguing that the German constitution guarantees the right to public assembly, freedom of speech and religion. The order was overturned in court in March 2022 on the basis that it represented an ""unjustified encroachment on the fundamental right to freedom of assembly"" and the protesters returned to the square directly in front of the center.Last week, Family Minister Lisa Paus vowed to introduce legislation to prevent anti-abortion activists from protesting outside of abortion clinics and counseling centers. ""Women must have unhindered access to counseling services and facilities that perform abortions,"" Paus told Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland, describing the so-called ""vigils"" as ""unacceptable attacks on women's extremely personal decision"".The government has also agreed to set up a commission to look at how abortion could be regulated outside of the German Criminal Code with a view to decriminalization.In her Pro-Life office overlooking the square where the protesters gather, Claudia Hohmann sees the protests as part of a broader conservative backlash against equality, reproductive rights and the freedom to live as one chooses.""They won't break us or intimidate us, of course not, but it's damaging to our counseling service,"" she says.""They are against everything we do here, against sex education, against supporting minorities, against the freedom to live as one chooses. Those are our goals, and that's why [for them] we're the total Antichrist, the enemy.""Edited by: Rina GoldenbergWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4827169,"Bundesliga title race is real, but Bayern still favorites","How late in the year does it have to be before the reality of a different Bundesliga champion can genuinely be entertained?Borussia Dortmund continue to deliver strong arguments that a new champion is possible. Upstarts Union Berlin are still in the hunt, but after their recent humbling in Munich and a tired looking draw at home against Cologne perhaps they are running their own race.Edin Terzic's side have won eight straight in the league and are level on points with the defending champions. The last time the club won this many in a row was back in the 2011/12 season, when Jürgen Klopp was the head coach and they ended up winning the title — which was also the last time a team not called Bayern Munich won the Bundesliga.Furthermore, Dortmund are making fewer mistakes, questions about their mentality have clearly been answered and this time last year, Bayern were six points clear of their rivals in black and yellow. The possibility of a new champion is both seductive and compelling.History though, says otherwise.Two seasons ago, RB Leipzig were just two points behind Bayern Munich after 23 games and Bayern ended up winning the title by 13 points. The season before that, Bayern were one point ahead of RB Leipzig and four ahead of Dortmund at this point of the season and Bayern ended the campaign with 82 points while Dortmund trailed in second with 69.And perhaps most memorably is the 2018/19 season. Borussia Dortmund let a nine-point lead after 15 games slip. By the time matchday 23 had finished, Dortmund were ahead by just three points. The fight continued with Dortmund pulling two points clear again on matchday 27, but whenBayern beat Dortmund 5-0 the tide turned and Germany's most successful club edged out Dortmund by two points in one of the most thrilling seasons to date.Along with the past, the present Bayern Munich team is also very capable of defending the crown.With Jamal Musiala and a resurgent Thomas Müller, this side has a lot of quality.Granted, Julian Nagelsmann's team might have already drawn seven games this season — the last and only time they have drawn that many games in the last decade was in the 2016/17 season and it took 30 games — but they have only lost twice and they do score a lot more than anyone else.Against Stuttgart, it was Matthijs de Ligt scoring from range andEric Maxim Choupo-Motingdelivering another reminder why he is an underrated choice at number nine. Bayern's goals are proof of their strength in depth, their +44 goal difference matters right now and could be decisive in May too.Those goals are the reason Bayern are top after 23 games. In the last ten seasons, only in the aforementioned 2018/19 campaign have Bayern Munich not been top at this point in the season. In that time period, it has never been this close at this stage of the season, which is why excitement about the possibility of a new champion is only natural.Put that feeling into the ​​​​​​current discourse around competition in football, particularly in Germany, and it's clear to see how impactful a different team winning the Bundesliga this season would be for German football and those arguing the 50+1 ownership structure does not compromise competition.In the last decade, challengers in March have not stopped Bayern. The last time they did was in 2012 when Borussia Dortmund delivered an eight-game winning streak that ended in early March. Perhaps history is repeating itself after all.Edited by: Mark Hallam",2023/03/04,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4827237,Taiwan author wins Newman Award for Chinese Literature,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Chang Kuei-hsing (張貴興), an author born in Borneo, Malaysia, who later immigrated to Taiwan at the age of 20, won the prestigious Newman Award for Chinese Literature offered by the University of Oklahoma.The award is the first literary award in the United States aimed at promoting Chinese literature, with winners entitled to US$10,000 (NT$300,000) in prize money. The eighth award ceremony was held on Friday (March 3) at the University of Oklahoma.In his speech at the award ceremony, Chang said the award is significant as judges read his work in the original language and with an English translation. He praised the committee for choosing his work, and for helping to draw attention to Taiwanese authors.Chang was born in North Borneo, Malaysia, and attended local Chinese schools throughout his youth. He also contributed to Chinese language newspapers in his community.“Malaysia only has 300,000 Chinese, but we have seven daily Chinese-language newspapers. They would host supplements each week which nurtured my first writings,” said Chang at the award ceremony.Chang’s writings are infused with recollections of his early life in Borneo, particularly the surrounding jungle and wildlife of his rural upbringing. He draws upon nature in a literary style described as “magical realism.” His work also addresses the challenges of growing up as an immigrant in a largely homogenous culture.In 1976, at the age of 20, Chang left the jungle to come to Taiwan to pursue his studies at National Taiwan Normal University. He later became a Taiwanese citizen in 1982. He said he has spent two-thirds, or 46 years of his life, in Taiwan and thanked the environment which supported his life as a writer.“When I die, I want to leave my heart in Taiwan, but return my body to Borneo,” said Chang. Later, during the English translation of his Chinese-language remarks, he joked that he was only speaking metaphorically.“Taiwan is a small country but it has many outstanding talents which may have been limited because of Taiwan’s size. I hope that winning this prize will bring more attention to Taiwan,” said Chang.Chang has published six novels, with an English translation of his latest, ""Herd of Elephants"" (群象), to be released in the second half of this year.",2023/03/05,569,Culture

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4827259,Taiwan passport ranked 72nd by Nomad Capitalist,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The consulting firm Nomad Capitalist published its annual passport index this week, with Taiwan’s passport ranked 72nd out of 199 passports.Taiwan’s passport received a score of 83.00 on the index. In contrast, the number one passport on the index, the United Arab Emirates, received a score of 110.50. The lowest ranked passport on the list belongs to Afghanistan, with a score of 25.50.Taiwan passport holders can access a relatively high number of countries without a visa (76), or through visa-on-arrival or electronic travel authorization (eTA) schemes (58). However, Nomad Capitalist ranked the country’s passport as relatively low on global perception. It scored in the intermediate range on issues of dual citizenship and freedom at home.Screenshot from Nomad Capitalist.While the number of countries that can be accessed on a given visa is an important aspect of Nomad Capitalist’s ranking system, it is not the only factor. The index also takes taxation laws into account as well as the possibility of dual citizenship, global perception as well as freedom at home.The closest Asian neighbors to Taiwan’s passport ranking are Macao, which ranked 70th, followed by Hong Kong, which tied for 54th with Costa Rica. In the opposite direction, further down the index, is Thailand, which ranked 100th. China tied with Eswatini and Morocco at 132 on the index.With the exception of the number one spot, which went to the United Arab Emirates, and the number eight spot, New Zealand, all of the other top ten passports belong to European countries. The top ten list is as follows.1. UAE
2. Luxembourg
3. Switzerland

7. Czech
8. New Zealand

Her coach thought a naked weigh in would allow her to overcome the weight discrepancy. In a desperate attempt to lose weight, Lo even cut her hair.As time ran out for the weigh in, she was eventually disqualified. Lo’s coach, Liu Tsung-ta (劉聰達) posted on Facebook, apologizing for the matter and admitting he failed to fulfill his responsibility to supervise athletes.Liu explained that the weigh in for the U.S. Open is quite short, lasting only two hours, from 10:00 to noon. He instructed Lo to report her weight at 7 a.m. when it was discovered she was 0.3 kg overweight. Liu then instructed her to go for a run.Lo was still hopeful that she could pass the weight test if she shed her clothing, but at 11:45 a.m., the judges said she had to remain in underwear and shorts for the weigh in. By noon, there were no more chances to make the weight cut-off, making her trip to the U.S. a waste.Her coach said that other international taekwondo competitions like a recent event held in China allow for a naked weigh-in. Lo is quite tall for a typical competitor in her weight class, standing at 190 cm, making weight qualifying quite difficult.Lo still has a chance to compete and achieve Olympic qualification requirements in the upcoming Belgian Open Taekwondo and Dutch Open Taekwondo.",2023/03/05,1382,Sports & Entertainment

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4827331,"Under EU urging, Portugal will no longer issue golden visas","Five hundred thousand euros ($530,000) for a residence permit in a Schengen zone EU country: That's the deal the Portuguese government has been offering rich foreigners since 2012. About 12,000 investors have taken advantage of it, effectively purchasing an entry ticket to the European Union for themselves and their families.Now Portugal is calling time on its golden visa program, partly in response to pressure from the European Union. Prime Minister Antonio Costa has announced that the program will expire on March 16.""It's good that the golden visa is finally being abolished — they should never really have introduced it,"" said Ana Gomes, a former Socialist Party member of the European Parliament who has opposed the program since its introduction. ""They were an invitation for money laundering, and they made it possible for criminal and terrorist organizations legally to infiltrate the Schengen zone."" Gomes said more than half of the people who applied for golden visas were from countries where money laundering is particularly prevalent, and added that Portugal never investigated where their funds came from.The program brought in about €‎7 billion euros for the country, almost 90% of which came from the purchase of property. According to the Portuguese Immigration and Border Service's statistics, only 22 visas were issued for job creation, resulting in a mere 280 new jobs in over 10 years.Hugo Santos Ferreira, the president of the Portuguese Association of Real Estate Developers and Investors, is not at all happy about the proposal to end the golden residence permits. ""It's an attack on all foreign investors who want to invest their money in Portugal,"" he said. ""Portugal will lose its credibility and its good reputation as an investment-friendly country.""Santos Ferreira said Portugal needed international investors to strengthen its economy and couldn't afford to do without an important instrument that brings in over €600 million per year. ""On top of that, the program has created thousands of jobs in the construction and property sector,"" he said.In recent years, the price of real estate in Portugal has skyrocketed, particularly in its two biggest cities, Lisbon and Porto. Critics say the golden visa program is partly responsible, as well as the fact that more and more EU citizens are buying houses and apartments in Portugal — at prices Portuguese people can no longer afford.""The golden visas have prompted considerable price increases, especially at the top end of the market,"" Gomes said. And this is the argument that the government has now adopted to justify shutting down the golden visa program. Gomes said the official line was just a pretext, and it was increasingly harsh criticism from the European Union that was ultimately responsible for the program's imminent end.The criticism primarily concerned the visa applicants' often dubious origins. Since the start of the war in Ukraine, Russians have been banned from investing in Portugal, and excluded from the golden visa program. But, Gomes said, countries such as China and Vietnam, whose wealthy citizens are eligible for golden visas, are not exactly models of transparency either.Santos Ferreira said all transactions in Portugal were strictly controlled. He acknowledged that there are bad actors everywhere, but he doesn't consider that a reason to abolish the golden visas. ""No one's talking about closing down the banks,"" he said, ""although it's well-known that money can be laundered there, too."" He said he hoped that the government would back down at the last minute and that the golden visas might continue in some other form, but it looks as if this is the end of the road for Portugal's €500,000 Schengen entrance card.""It was simply too untransparent and dangerous,"" Gomes said.It remains to be seen what will happen to holders of existing golden visas. According to some reports, their residence permits will only be renewed if they are actually living permanently in Portugal.This article was originally written in German.",2023/03/05,,

Its planned budgets for the year put defense spending at 1.55 trillion yuan ($225 billion, €211 billion).On Taiwan, Li said Beijing should advance the process of ""peaceful reunification"" while taking steps to oppose Taiwan's independence.""As we Chinese on both sides of the Taiwan Strait are one family bound by blood, we should advance economic and cultural exchanges and cooperation across the Taiwan Strait and improve the systems and policies that contribute to the wellbeing of our Taiwan compatriots,"" Li said.Taiwan's government on Sunday emphasized that China should respect the core principles of sovereignty, democracy, and freedom that are important to the Taiwanese people.Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council, which is responsible for shaping policy toward Beijing, also urged China to approach cross-Taiwan Strait issues in a pragmatic, fair and mutually respectful manner.The council emphasized the importance of finding a peaceful resolution to the ongoing tensions between China and Taiwan.The meeting of 2,977 members of the NPC is the year's highest-profile event, but its work is limited to endorsing decisions made by the ruling Communist Party.As a result, there are no debates and all documents and decisions are expected to receive unanimous support.This year's gathering also comes at the start of China's latest five-year political cycle, as an addendum to the ruling Communist Party's 20th annual congress in October.There, President Xi Jinping secured a historic third term and cemented his iron grip on power.In the coming days, the NPC will see Xi renamed head of state, the replacement of Li Keqiang as premier and the appointment of other top members of the State Council, China's Cabinet.rm/fb (Reuters, AP, AFP, dpa)",2023/03/05,,

Unfortunately, they face the difficult task of besting the top teams in Pool A, such as Cuba, Panama, and the Netherlands.With just two teams advancing from Pool A to the quarterfinals, Taiwan faces nearly insurmountable odds, a fact made more evident by a CTS report that indicates Taiwan does not even rank amongst the top half, or top 10 teams in the tournament, according to the official WBC rankings.Worse yet, a Dominican Republic reporter calculated the historical run difference amongst each of the 20 teams in the tournament. Among the teams, Taiwan ranked third from the bottom. While the stats may disappoint, fans are still holding out hope as the final roster spot for the Taiwan team was filled on Sunday (March 5).Right-handed pitcher, Teng Kai-Wei (鄧愷威), arrived to join the team from the San Francisco Giants minor league system. Teng said he was warmly greeted at the hotel by his teammates. He said his goal for the tournament is not to waste too many balls and waste too many pitches, according to CTS.As of press time, Teng had yet to discuss his pitching schedule with the coaching staff. He said there were some special arrangements between his U.S. ballclub and the Taiwan team, and he was happy to abide by the agreement.Teng said he was happy to put on the Taiwan uniform once again, following his previous success with the Taiwan team which won the 2019 Asian Baseball Championships. He admits there will be pressure, but it is also a great responsibility to play on behalf of his home country.Unfortunately, competition in Pool A is expected to be quite difficult as many teams have MLB players. In past World Baseball Classics, Taiwan not only struggled to score in addition to pitching woes.Taiwan's first test comes against Panama on Wednesday (March 8) at 7 p.m.",2023/03/05,1190,Sports & Entertainment

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4827360,War in Ukraine diminished China's hope of easy victory in Taiwan: Peter Zeihan,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Geopolitical analyst and consultant Peter Zeihan discussed the economic, demographic, and political landscape in East Asia with Taiwan News in early February.In part one of the interview, Zeihan explained China’s ongoing demographic crisis. In part two, he shares his perspective on the potential for military conflict between Taiwan and China. In his view, the likelihood of a serious military engagement between Taipei and Beijing is relatively low.

However, this somewhat optimistic view is tempered with the caveat that, in the midst of China’s catastrophic population decline and Xi Jinping’s (習近平) increasing isolation at the reins of power in Beijing, political outcomes may be unpredictable. In Zeihan’s estimation, the current military conflict in Ukraine has heavily influenced Beijing’s calculus toward its plans for a military operation to capture Taiwan.In his interview with Taiwan News, Zeihan outlines four key assumptions that the leadership in Beijing likely held prior to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. However, over the past year of conflict, all four of those assumptions have been almost entirely undermined.The first assumption is that Beijing could win the war quickly and easily. In light of the prolonged conflict that Russia has committed itself to in Ukraine, in addition to the geographic advantage that Taiwan has over Ukraine in an invasion scenario, this assumption is “out the window,” says Zeihan.The second assumption relates to the effectiveness and reliability of Russian weaponry and logistics equipment, which China has heavily invested in. Zeihan suggests that the performance of Russian weapons and hardware in Ukraine may be causing China some “serious buyer’s remorse.”The third assumption relates to the possibility of international sanctions that other nations would likely use to target China. Given Russia’s experience, China must understand the risks that sanctions would present.“If you take the sanctions that are on Russia and put them on Beijing, you get a deindustrialization collapse, complete with a famine in less than six months,” he said.Similarly, the fourth assumption, which Zeihan thinks ""really terrifies the Politburo,” is the idea that Beijing could evade international boycotts if it were to attack Taiwan. Beyond government sanctions, Zeihan believes the prospect of global companies abandoning investments and walking away from the Chinese economy may serve as a strong incentive for Beijing to avoid military action.At the end of part two, Zeihan discusses how a war would affect Taiwan’s advanced semiconductor industry, and how Washington might respond.Zeihan offers a warning to Taiwan that its days as the primary manufacturer of the highest-end chips are not going to last much longer. He says this period is headed toward its end “regardless of what happens with the United States or war with China.”Part two of Peter Zeihan’s interview with Taiwan News can be viewed below. Keep an eye out for the final part of the interview which is coming soon. In part three, Zeihan discusses Taiwan’s economic outlook and some serious problems with Taiwan’s domestic energy policies.",2023/03/07,1752,Politics

The giant pangasius is an invasive, carnivorous fish.After the photo of the large fish was posted on a Facebook group dedicated to Xiaying residents, many members of the group commented on the fish. Some people who live near Wuchengen Park said that the release of the invasive fish into the pond had impacted the ecology of the pond, causing the number of fish and turtles to decrease.Xuan Tian Shang Di Temple committee chairperson Chiang Chin-li (姜金利) said the temple would start cleaning the pond on Saturday and the fish caught from the pond would be temporarily placed elsewhere.",2023/03/05,7434,Environment

The concert also featured Eick's brother Johannes playing the drums.Mathias Eick and his brother Johannes come from a musical family. He started learning the piano when he was just five, followed by the trumpet a year later. He also plays the vibraphone, the double bass, guitar and keyboards. But the trumpet was always the instrument closest to his heart, Eick reveals on his website.Eick has received numerous awards, including the International Jazz Talent prize and several others. Eick's music has been lauded by critics as an ""innovative"" force in European jazz and he has played with ensembles including the Trondheim Jazz Orchestra, and with performers including French drummer Manu Katche, Finnish jazz pianist Iro Haarla and Swedish bassist Lars Danielsson.His music has been described as ""plaintive and spare"" by JazzTimes, in a article following the release of his first album, ""The Door"" (2008). British newspaper The Guardian has described the trumpeter as someone with ""a cinematic interest in musical storytelling."" Eick's albums include ""Skala"" (2010), ""Midwest,"" (2014), ""Ravensburg"" (2017) and most recently, ""When We Leave"" (2021).First up are the tracks ""Family"" and ""Children,"" after which you'll hear Mathias Eick introducing himself and his quintet. After that, it's ""At Sea"" followed by ""Arvo,"" which, in turn is followed by a drum solo. Up next is ""Oslo."" The following track is called ""Ravensburg,"" from Eick's album of the same name.During his performance, Eick told the audience that he often visited his grandmother who lived in southern Germany. She often got the children puzzles from the toy brand Ravensburg, which inspired him to write the piece. That track is fittingly followed by one called ""For my Grandmothers.""And that brings our series of DW Jazz Concerts to an end.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4827451,Estonia votes in shadow of Russia's war in Ukraine,"Estonians are going to the polls on Sunday to elect a new parliament in an election heavily overshadowed by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.Prime Minister Kaja Kallas' pro-European and pro-Kyiv government is facing a challenge from a far-right party that wants to stop the entry of Ukrainian refugees and brake the country's transition to green energy.None of the nine parties running in the election is expected to win an absolute majority, meaning that a coalition will need to be formed.The current coalition government, led by Kallas' Reform party, has vehemently supported EU sanctions against Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine and backed Western arms deliveries to Kyiv. Kallas, the first woman to lead the Estonian government, has also called for a strengthening of NATO's eastern flank against threats from Russia, which borders Estonia.However, it is not certain that Kallas, whom opinion polls cast as the favorite to lead the next government, can maintain her alliance with the Social Democrats and the conservative Isamaa (Fatherland) party.A leading election rival is the far-right nationalist EKRE party, which opinion polls place in second place.EKRE, under its leader Martin Helme, has pledged not to admit more Ukrainian refugees.While saying he wants to maintain support for Kyiv in its defense against the Russian attack, Helme has accused Kallas of undermining Estonia's defenses by giving weapons to Ukraine.EKRE has also promised to slash energy bills by opposing the transition to green energy, amid a cost of living crisis caused by some of the highest inflation in the EU — 18.6% year on year in January.Despite EKRE's good showing in opinion polls, analysts consider it unlikely the party will make it into government, especially as Kallas has ruled it out as a coalition partner.Any future coalition will partly depend on election performances by the center-left Centre Party, which is promising more investment in infrastructure and affordable housing, and the pro-business party Estonia 200.Analysts say a coalition between Reform, Estonia 200 and the center-left, pro-EU Social Democrats is possible, as is one between Reform, Centre and Isamaa.The elections are the ninth to take place since Estonia, now an EU and NATO member, gained independence from the Soviet occupation in 1991.Some 965,000 people are eligible to cast their ballots for the 101 seats in the Riigikogu legislature.A third of eligible voters cast their vote via the internet in the days leading up to Sunday, including Kallas, with Estonia in 2005 becoming the first country in Europe to introduce online voting.

The agency said its team later saw at least five houses on fire after attacks in Khromove.On Saturday, a British intelligence update said Russian fighters made further inroads into Bakhmut's northern suburbs, prompting Ukrainian units to destroy two critical bridges outside the city in the past 36 hours.One of these bridges links Bakhmut to the nearby town of Chasiv Yar, along the last remaining Ukrainian resupply route, the British report said.The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, has suggested that Ukrainian troops are preparing to withdraw from the key eastern stronghold.But Ukraine's Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov told the German newspaper Bild am Sonntag that Russia's losses in Bakhmut ""run to 500 killed and wounded every day.""The Russian soldiers were just ""cannon fodder"" in the ""meat grinder tactics"" used by Moscow, he said.The Ukrainian defense chief said Moscow was making efforts to capture Bakhmut because it held ""a symbolic place for the Russians.""Capturing Bakhmut would not only give Russian fighters a rare battlefield gain after months of setbacks, but could also rupture Ukraine's supply lines, allowing Moscow's forces to advance toward other Ukrainian strongholds in the eastern Donetsk region.Here are some of the other notable developments concerning the war in Ukraine on Sunday, March 5:There has been an increase in close combat in Ukraine, the latest UK defense intelligence report said, citing recent evidence.The assessed that this is likely due to the Russian command's insistence on offensive action consisting mostly of dismounted infantry, with less support from artillery fire due to a shortage of ammunition in Russia.The report, which was released on Sunday, March 5, 2023 revealed that in late February 2023, Russia  mobilized reservists who were ordered to assault a Ukrainian concrete strong point armed only with firearms and shovels.The ""shovels"" are believed to be entrenching tools that are being used for hand-to-hand combat.One of the reservists who took part in the assault described being ""neither physically nor psychologically"" prepared for the action.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Kyiv was planning to increase its cooperation with European institutions this year.His remarks came shortly after he met with European Parliament President Roberta Metsola during her visit to Ukraine.""The task is to actively prepare everything for our country's membership in the European Union, increase arms deliveries to Ukraine and strengthen sanctions against Russia,"" Zelenskyy said in his daily video address.Meanwhile, Metsola urged increasing arms deliveries to the Ukrainian military. ""Member states should seriously consider sending fighter jets to Ukraine,"" she said.She expressed hope that accession negotiations for Ukraine could begin as early as this year.Latvian Prime Minister Krisjanis Karins expressed his support for supplying Ukraine with fighter jets in an interview with the German news magazine Der Spiegel.Karins stated that he saw no reason why the West should not provide Ukrainian forces with fighter jets if they needed them. He said the delivery of fighter jets was only a matter of time, and that providing weapons to Ukraine was essential for achieving peace.""True, we all want peace. But the only way to peace is for Ukraine to win. And for that, it needs our weapons,"" Karins said.The Latvian prime minister also said that the Baltic nation is aiming to spend 3% of its GDP on defense, more than the NATO goal of 2%.As a ""frontline state,"" Latvia has no choice, he said.In December, the Baltic states of Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania expressed their intention to increase their defense spending in response to the full-scale invasion of Ukraine launched by Moscow a year ago.Russia's position as a significant energy supplier has suffered a permanent setback following the West's abandonment of Moscow's oil and gas due to its war in Ukraine, according to the head of the International Energy Agency (IEA), Fatih Birol.In an interview published in the French newspaper Liberation, Birol said that ""Russia has lost the energy battle.""He noted that Moscow's oil and gas exports have fallen by 40% since its military forces invaded Ukraine a year ago, adding that this is just the start of its problems.Birol also emphasized that the departure of foreign experts from Russia would result in a decrease in oil and gas production without their technical support.Russia cannot simply replace Europe, once the largest consumer, with Asia, the IEA head said, as it would take years to build pipelines from Western Siberia to China.""Russia's role in international energy affairs will be much less important in the future,"" Birol said.Polling stations opened across Estonia with the center-right Reform Party, led by Prime Minister Kaja Kallas, is seen as the front-runner.Kallas has gained international attention over the past year as a vocal supporter of Ukraine against its invasion by Russia.Since taking office in 2021, Kallas has been advocating for sanctions against Moscow, a stance that has raised her profile and boosted her standing in the polls.Her party is expected to win the most votes in the general election, according to recent polling.However, Kallas is facing a challenge from the populist opposition party EKRE. The party is pushing for a reduction in Estonia's involvement in the Ukraine crisis and is blaming the government for the country's economic struggles.ss/fb (AP, dpa)",2023/03/05,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4827469,"ROSEN, A HIGHLY RECOGNIZED LAW FIRM, Encourages Inspirato Incorporated Investors with Losses to Secure Counsel Before Important Deadline in Securities Class Action First Filed by the Firm - ISPO","New York, New York - Newsfile Corp. - March 4, 2023 - WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of the securities of Inspirato Incorporated (NASDAQ: ISPO) between May 11, 2022 and December 15, 2022, both dates inclusive (the ""Class Period"") of the important April 17, 2023 lead plaintiff deadline, in the securities class action commenced by the Firm.SO WHAT: If you purchased Inspirato securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Inspirato class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=10246 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email pkim@rosenlegal.com or cases@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than April 17, 2023. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually handle securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) the Company's unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 (collectively, the ""Non-Reliance Periods"") included in the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") for the Non-Reliance Periods, could no longer be relied upon; (2) the quarterly reports could no longer be relied upon due to the incorrect application of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (""ASC 842"") with respect to the assessment of right-of-use assets and liabilities, resulting in an understatement of both right-of-use assets and total lease liabilities of approximately 9% for each of the Non-Reliance Periods resulting in an understatement of total assets and total liabilities by approximately 5% for each of the Non-Reliance periods, and due to property-related and other expenses being under accrued in the first quarter, and over accrued in the second quarter, resulting in cost of revenue being understated by approximately 1% and overstated by approximately 5% in the first and second quarter, respectively (similarly, any previously issued or filed reports, press releases, earnings releases, and investor presentations or other communications describing the Company's condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements and other related financial information covering the Non-Reliance Periods should no longer be relied upon); (3) the Company was not in compliance with the periodic filing requirements for continued listing set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) (the ""Rule"") as a result of its failure to file its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2022 (the third quarter report) with the SEC by the required due date; and (4) as a result, defendants' statements about its business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.To join the Inspirato class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=10246 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email pkim@rosenlegal.com or cases@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.No Class Has Been Certified.

Fire service official Emdadul Haque said there were no immediate casualties.The UNHCR in Bangladesh wrote in a tweet that volunteers from the camp were tackling the fire. The agency also said it was giving support.Local newspaper Dhaka Tribune reported that four fire services units had also been deployed.""We currently don't have an estimate for damages but there are no reports of casualties,"" police superintendent at Cox's Bazar Rafiqul Islam told Reuters. He added that the blaze had been brought under control and that officials from fire, police and refugee relief departments were all on the scene.""Some 2,000 shelters have been burnt, leaving about 12,000 forcibly displaced Myanmar nationals shelterless,"" Mijanur Rahman, Bangladesh's refugee commissioner, told AFP, adding that 35 mosques and 21 learning centers were among the destroyed buildings.Mohammad Shamsuddoza, a senior official at Bangladesh's Refugee Relief and Repatriation Commission, told German news agency DPA, that these were made mostly of bamboo and tarpaulin.Another police official said that the cause of the fire had not yet been ascertained.The camp has seen similar fires in January 2022 and March 2021, with the latter killing 15 people and destroying more than 10,000 homes.Over 1 million Rohingya refugees have fled to Bangladesh to escape state oppression that the US has said amounts to genocide.The number of Rohingya crossing the border shot up in 2017 when the military in Buddhist-majority Myanmar began a violent crackdown on the minority group.Most Rohingya in Myanmar have been denied citizenship and other rights.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4827489,Greece: Thousands protest train crash as PM offers apology,"Mourning swelled into anger again in Athens on Sunday as thousands of people gathered in front of the Greek parliament on Syntagma Square to protest against the government and rail company they hold responsible for the recent deadly train crash.Protesters have already clashed with police in previous days, while train worker unions have been holding strikes. They said they had already warned the rail company, Hellenic Train, about safety issues on the line.There were early reports of violence at Sunday's protest, called by university students, public sector employees and rail workers, as police clashed with groups of protesters.Police said some 12,000 people had shown up, with many releasing black balloons into the sky in memory of the dead. Others carried signs with slogans such as ""Down with murderous governments.""Meanwhile, Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis turned to Facebook on Sunday to offer an apology to the families of the 57 victims in Tuesday's train crash, which has become the worst rail disaster in Greek history.""As prime minister, I owe a big apology to everyone, but above all to the victims' relatives,"" Mitsotakis wrote on Facebook.""Both personally, but also in the name of all those who have governed the country for years,"" he added.""Because, indeed, it cannot be that in Greece in 2023, two trains can run on the same line in different directions and nobody notice,"" the prime minister continued.In an apparent agreement with protesters, Mitsotakis added that: ""We cannot, we don't want to and we mustn't hide behind human error.""The AFP news agency reported that investigators were looking at the possibility of bringing criminal charges against Hellenic Train.For its part, the company released a statement on Saturday defending its response. ""These are particularly difficult days for the country and for our company,"" it said.The 59-year-old man, who has already admitted responsibility for the accident, was expected in court on Sunday after his hearing was postponed on Saturday.If charged and convicted of negligent homicide, he could face life imprisonment.However, details about the incident have come out revealing that the as-yet-unidentified suspect may have lacked the appropriate experience. German news agency dpa reported that he had begun a traineeship last year despite being more than ten years older than the maximum age allowed for such a position.The fact that he was left unsupervised during a busy holiday weekend has also raised further questions.""In the case, there are important new elements that need to be examined,"" the suspect's lawyer, Stefanos Pantzartsidis, said.ab/fb (AFP, dpa, Reuters)",2023/03/05,,

Armenia said the Azerbaijani armed forces opened fire on the car of a Passport and Visa Department of the police.The two former Soviet nations have been locked in a conflict for decades over the mountainous region, which in 2020 boiled over into full-blown war.A Russian-brokered peace deal was reached late in 202 after more than 6,000 lives were lost.There have been several flare-ups between the two sides since the  agreement was signed.The agreement to end the 2020 war left a winding road called the Lachin Corridor as the only authorized connection between Nagorno- Karabakh and Armenia, a lifeline for supplies to the region's approximately 120,000 people.However, traffic on that road has been mostly blocked since December by Azerbaijani environmental activists to protest what they say is illegal mining.Armenia has accused Azerbaijan of backing the protesters to create blockade.""Sending an international fact-finding team to the Lachin corridor and Nagorno-Karabakh is becoming a vital necessity,""  Armenia's foreign ministry said after the shooting.Azerbaijan's ministry of defence said, ""Today's incident once proofed that Azerbaijan needs to create an appropriate checkpoint on the Lachin-Khankendi road.lo/jcg (AFP, AP)",2023/03/05,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4827516,Leverkusen's Florian Wirtz slowly getting back to his best,"Florian Wirtz is still looking for his old confidence. The odd ball escapes his control, the occasional pass doesn't find a teammate. Against Hertha Berlin on matchday 23, the Leverkusen playmaker battled through the rust, but his teammates showed no signs of frustration. They're just happy that Wirtz is back playing at this level after suffering a painful ACL injury in his knee last year.Wirtz's spectacular assist for Moussa Diaby to score Leverkusen's third in a 4-1 win was proof of the 19-year-old's exceptional abilities. Wirtz received the pass from Diaby and as he turned towards goal he unleashed a beautiful pass to split the defense and set up his French teammate.It was this moment of brilliance that made it easier for his teammates to forgive the occasional poor touch. In eight appearances this season, Wirtz has four assists. In a total of 68 Bundesliga games, the German teenager has 13 goals and 20 assists — no one has managed that before in the Bundesliga.""We are a better team with Florian, and because of him I am a better coach. But we can't hope that he will do it all alone. That isn't right for him or us,"" said Leverkusen head coach Xabi Alonso recently.Wirtz's contract at Leverkusen runs until 2027, but it seems unlikely that the youngster will remain at the club until then. However, the Wirtz family does not seem easily swayed by more lucrative offers from other teams. Europe's top clubs have been getting in line for quite some time and if Leverkusen do not qualify for European football this season then offers will likely increase.Wirtz's father Hans-Joachim, who is also his son's agent, gave hope to Leverkusen and their fans though.""Florian has a long-term contract with Bayer. We are interested in fulfilling as much of it as possible,"" Hans-Joachim said recently. ""Of course, every young player wants to play with the best but until the Euros in 2024 Florian is best placed at Leverkusen.""There is a reason Germany head coach Hansi Flick was disappointed to get the news ahead of the 2022 World Cup that Wirtz would miss out due to injury. In Flick's future plans for Germany, the teenager has a big role to play. Flick is hoping that at the home European Championships in 2024 Wirtz will be back to his full strength and give Germany a decisive boost in quality.After 82 minutes against Hertha, Wirtz's shift was done. A handshake from head coach Alonso and a big round of applause from Leverkusen's home crowd was recognition of his performance and presence. After all, those in Leverkusen know how special this 19-year-old is.This article was originally written in German.",2023/03/05,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4827517,People still in need a month after Turkey-Syria earthquake,"At least 50,000 people have died, millions have lost their homes, and 214,000 buildings have collapsed or are at risk of doing so after the February 6 earthquake. The deaths and damage spanned 11 provinces in Turkey alone. Millions of people remain in urgent need of help.The death toll is expected to rise because there are numerous victims whose identities have yet to be clarified and who have not yet been officially registered as dead. People continue to look for their loved ones. Turkey's Justice Ministry did not comment when DW asked how many people were still missing.The grief of the survivors became intertwined with anger immediately after the quakes. People started asking how it was possible that so many buildings that were supposedly earthquake-proof had simply collapsed. They blamed the authorities and accused them of negligence. It turns out that building regulations were often not followed. So far, almost 1,000 people are formally suspected of having skirted construction regulations. So far, at least 235 people have been arrested, 330 are being monitored under judicial control, and four are in pretrial detention. Arrest warrants have also been issued for 270 other suspects. Five are abroad, 82 have already been released, and 32 have died.Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Authority had warned of the potentially catastrophic consequences of an earthquake years ago. It had also prepared and issued plans to reduce the risks from disasters from 2019 to 2021.In 2020, one of these plans forecast that a 7.5 magnitude earthquake would occur in Kahramanmaras. That prediction came true on February 6.According to UNICEF, about 5 million children have been affected by the earthquakes. On Wednesday, Turkey's Family and Social Services Ministry stated that, of the 1,911 children rescued from the ruins who did not require heavy medical intervention, 1,543 have been handed over to family members. Almost 100 remained in the care of the ministry itself, and 81 had yet to be identified.The ministry rejected reports that some of the children had been handed over to Islamist groups and associations with official connections. However, Halk TV, a station that is critical of the government, has reported that 60 children have been placed in three buildings in the Istanbul district of Beykoz where they were apparently in the care of Islamist groups.DW's Turkish service also reported that nine children had been taken away from their parents and enrolled in a Quran school with links to the radical Ismailaga branch of the Sufi Order.The government is under fire as Turkey is heading for presidential and parliamentary elections. The campaign was briefly interrupted after the earthquake but seems to have begun in earnest again. On Wednesday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan criticized the opposition in a speech and signaled that elections would be brought forward from June to take place on May 14. A decree is expected to be issued on Friday to make this date official.It is not known how the voting will take place in the most-affected cities. There has been a suggestion that voters from the earthquake zone would be able to cast their ballots in other cities for the presidential vote but not for the parliamentary elections.The mammoth task of reconstruction comes as Turkey is already in the midst of an economic crisis. The World Bank has calculated that the earthquake caused material damage worth of $34.2 billion (€32.5 billion). According to the Turkish Statistical Office (TÜIK), approximately 14 million people live in the 11 cities in the earthquake zone. The economy in the region, which accounts for about 9.8% of the GDP, is based on agriculture and animal husbandry, as well as textiles, steel and energy.The economist Mahfi Egilmez, a former undersecretary at Turkey's Finance Ministry, has published a detailed study on the economic consequences of the quake. In it he calculates that the removal of debris, the repair of damaged residential buildings and infrastructure, the construction of new homes, and state financial aid of $2.5 billion will come to a total of $48.7 billion. Of this, $27 billion will be for new housing.Economists say the destruction will lead to increased demand for many products and services, which in turn will fuel inflation, which is already high. The economist Murat Kubilay told DW that he expected inflation to reach at least 50% by the end of 2023.Freedom of speech and the press has been further restricted in Turkey since the earthquake. The Radio and Television Supreme Council (RTÜK) has already imposed fines amounting to around 8 million Turkish lira (ca. $426,000) on three TV stations for their coverage of the earthquake.Supporters of the major soccer clubs Fenerbahce and Besiktas who recently called on Erdogan and his government to resign have been banned from attending sporting events.The part of northern Syria affected by the earthquake had already been devastated by 12 years of civil war that Bashar Assad's regime has waged with the backing of Russia and Iran. Media report that about 8.8 million people were affected by the quake, many of whom are now homeless. Officially, there were 5,900 deaths but the actual figure is probably much higher.Most of the people affected in Syria received no help at all in the first few days. One of the reasons was that the borders were blocked. Though aid is now being sent to Syria, it is not reaching the people affected. Large parts of the earthquake zone are not under the full control of the regime. The city of Idlib, effectively the last rebel stronghold, is mainly controlled by Islamist militias. There are more than 2 million people who fled from other parts of Syria living here. Observers say the aid officially sent to Syria is not arriving here.Before the quakes, there were already about 1.8 million displaced people living in makeshift tents, shelters and homes in northwestern Syria. Now, many are forced to live outdoors in freezing temperatures. Ammar Fayyad told a reporter from DW's Arabic service that he and his son were traumatized and living in a car: ""Tents cost between $200 and $400, and we can't afford that, so we've decided to stay here.""This article was originally written in German.",2023/03/05,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4827547,UK: Liverpool rewrite record books by thrashing Manchester United 7-0,"Manchester United suffered its heaviest defeat in the English Premier League on Sunday, losing 7-0 to Liverpool in what was the club's worst loss since 1931 when it went down 7-0 in a game against Wolverhampton Wanderers in the second division.Liverpool, in turn, recorded their biggest ever margin of victory in the fixture.Mohamed Salah struck twice and became the Merseyside club's all-time leading Premier League scorer with 129 goals.""To get it today against United with that result is unbelievable. I'm going home to celebrate with the family, Chamomile tea and sleep,"" he said after the game.Cody Gakpo, Darwin Nunez both scored twice and Roberto Firmino also found the back of the net once.Six of Liverpools goals came in an explosive second-half performance.It was the first time since 1999 that three players had scored two goals for the same club in the Premier League.United claimed their first trophy since 2017 just a week ago by winning the League Cup.Sunday's sobering defeat, described by Sky Sports pundit and their former defender Gary Neville as a 'disgrace', however left them in third place on 49 points and surely out of the title race.Erik ten Hag accused his Manchester United players of an ""unprofessional"" and ""unacceptable"" performance.""This is definitely a strong setback and is unacceptable. I'm really disappointed and angry about it. It is a reality check,"" the Manchester United manager said.Liverpool's previous biggest win over United was a 7-1 victory in 1895 when both clubs were in the second tier.The team's fourth win in five league matches lifted them above Newcastle United into fifth on 42 points, three points behind fourth-placed Tottenham Hotspur with a game in hand.""It was a fantastic day for everyone,"" Liverpool skipper Jordan Henderson told Sky Sports. ""The performance level from every single player was top quality today which is something that we've been missing for a while of course.""lo/jcg (AP, AFP, Reuters)",2023/03/05,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4827562,"Delaware Singapore To Set The Next Frontier of Enterprise Digital Transformation, New Innovations Await","SINGAPORE -  Media OutReach - 6 March 2023 - With the digital landscape entering its next phase,  delaware Singapore has plans to lead the charge in the next stage of digital transformation. With a large focus being placed on low/no code innovations and the development of an automated ecosystem, delaware Singapore is doubling down on its investments in these cutting-edge technologies that will be the leading solutions in the coming years. As such, delaware Singapore is poised to be a pioneer among its peers in the race towards the future of enterprise.             The Low-Code/No-Code Solution    Creating computer applications (Apps for short) is a laborious process. It is an intricate writing of line-by-line code to create programs that serve fixed purposes. Let alone a lack of capacity for easy customisations; a single mistake would cause a complete malfunction and be hard to locate.  Low-code/no-code solutions, however, present a fascinating alternative – a modular approach that allows professional developers to quickly build applications by relieving them of the need to write code line by line.   Suffice to say, it is little wonder that the proliferation of low-code/no-code platforms is an opportunity that arose from a lack of skilled software developers. The efficacy and efficiency required to improve turnaround time for developing projects have never been more critical in this fast-paced age.    The Advent of Transformation    As it stands, many enterprises still rely on outdated, manual processes, which can hinder efficiency and organisation as the information is not centralised. What’s more, delaware Singapore has noticed that many of its clients — large enterprises — do not have dedicated data warehouses to manage their information. Moreover, many enterprises utilise multi-product ecosystems, with most of the products being cloud-based. This results in a hybrid landscape with cloud and on-prem applications — which presents a significant challenge when integrating the layers.   Hence, the investment into new technology trends, such as low-code/no-code platforms, will present a momentous change in how businesses manage their information infrastructure. Furthermore, as automation continues to evolve, AI-enabled automation is taking centre stage. This evolution of Robotic Process Automation (RPA) will become an essential element that extends into a full suite of hyper-automation processes like workflows, low-code apps, chatbots and AI-based services.    Investing into the Future of ICT Solutions    delaware Singapore’s commitment to investing and exploring the best solutions in the market, is poised not only by the gap caused by the current solutions adopted by its clients but also to bring further value to its clients. An example of a product delaware Singapore is particularly proud of is its  DEL20 innovation, which allows clients to experiment with new technology and how it can solve business challenges, as well as unlock new opportunities. The company has also developed a number of in-house IPs, such as  Fuse and FAST packages, to accelerate clients’ adoption of low-code frameworks. delaware Singapore is also co-investing with Microsoft and its clients on projects that involve the development and implementation of Microsoft solutions, such as the  Microsoft Power Platform. As such, delaware Singapore looks forward to sharing more about its progress and the impact of its investments in the coming months.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4827563,China sets modest growth target of about 5% as parliament opens,"BEIJING, March 5 (Reuters) - China set a modest target for economic growth this year of around 5% on Sunday as the National People's Congress (NPC) kicked-off its annual parliamentary session, which is poised to implement the biggest government shakeup in a decade.China's gross domestic product (GDP) grew by just 3% last year, one of its worst showings in decades, squeezed by three years of COVID-19 restrictions, crisis in its vast property sector, a crackdown on private enterprise and weakening demand for Chinese exports.In his work report, outgoing Premier Li Keqiang emphasised the need for economic stability and expanding consumption, setting a goal to create around 12 million urban jobs this year, up from last year's target of at least 11 million.Li set a budget deficit target at 3.0% of GDP, widening from a goal of around 2.8% last year.""We should give priority to the recovery and expansion of consumption,"" said Li, who spoke for just under an hour in a speech to open the parliament, which will run through March 13.""The incomes of urban and rural residents should be boosted through multiple channels. We should stabilize spending on big-ticket items and promote recovery in consumption of consumer services,"" he said.This year's growth target of around 5% was at the low end of expectations, as policy sources had recently told Reuters a range as high as 6% could be set. It is also below last year's target of around 5.5%.""While the official growth target has been lowered for the second consecutive year, which might be a disappointment to the market, we reckon investors (should) pay attention to the underlying growth momentum to gauge the recovery pace,"" said Zhou Hao, economist at Guotai Junan International.COMBAT PREPAREDNESS, 'PEACEFUL REUNIFICATION'Li said China's armed forces should devote greater energy to training under combat conditions and boost combat preparedness.China should also promote the peaceful development of relations with Taiwan and advance the process of China's ""peaceful reunification"", but also take resolute steps to oppose Taiwan independence, he said.China's increasingly fraught relations with the United States were just one of a host of challenges Beijing is facing, as the government prepares for its biggest shake-up in a decade during this year's parliamentary session.Li and a slate of more reform-oriented economic policy officials are set to retire during the congress, making way for loyalists to President Xi Jinping, who further tightened his grip on power when he secured a precedent-breaking third leadership term at October's Communist Party Congress.During the NPC, former Shanghai party chief Li Qiang, a longtime Xi ally, is expected to be confirmed as premier, tasked with reinvigorating the world's second-largest economy.The rubber-stamp parliament will also discuss Xi's plans for an ""intensive"" and ""wide-ranging"" reorganisation of state and Communist Party entities, state media reported on Tuesday, with analysts expecting a further deepening of Communist Party penetration of state bodies.The NPC opened on a smoggy day amid tight security in the Chinese capital, with 2,948 delegates gathered in the cavernous Great Hall of the People on the west side of Tiananmen Square.It is the first NPC meeting since China abruptly dropped its zero-COVID policy in December, following rare nationwide protests.",2023/03/06,221,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4827564,"Asia stocks rally, bonds tense for U.S. rate tests","SYDNEY, March 6 (Reuters) - Asian shares edged up on Monday while bond markets held their breath ahead of an update on the U.S. rate outlook from the world's most powerful central banker, and a jobs report that could decide if the next hike needs to be super-sized.
There was some disappointment that Beijing chose to lowball its growth outlook with a target of 5%, rather than the 5.5%-plus favoured by the market, but the recent run of actual data has been strong enough to keep investors optimistic.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (.MIAPJ0000PUS) rose 0.8%, after bouncing 1.5% last week.
Japan's Nikkei (.N225) climbed 1.0% to a three-month top, while South Korean stocks (.KS11) added 0.6% helped by a softer reading on inflation.
S&P 500 futures dipped 0.1% and Nasdaq futures 0.2%, after rallying on Friday as bond yields eased back a little.
Yields on 10-year Treasuries stood at 3.970%, after last week's spike to 4.09% proved tempting enough to attract buyers.
Markets have become resigned to more rate rises from the Federal Reserve but are hoping it will stick with quarter-point moves rather than switch back to half-point hikes.
San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly on Saturday reiterated rates would have to go up but set a high bar for moving to half-point increases.
Futures imply a 72% chance the Fed will go by 25 basis points at its meeting on March 22.
All of which sets the scene for Fed Chair Jerome Powell's testimony to congress on Tuesday and Wednesday, where he will no doubt be quizzed on whether larger hikes are needed.
Much, however, might depend on what the February payrolls report reveals on Friday. Forecasts are centered on a more modest increase of 200,000 following January's barnstorming 517,000 jump, but risks are on the upside.
And that will be followed by the February CPI report on March 14.
KURODA BOWS OUT
""Powell's testimony comes before the payrolls and inflation numbers, therefore, he is likely to avoid committing to a policy path,"" said Jan Nevruzi, an analyst at NatWest Markets.
""Payrolls are due on the final day when Fed officials can publicly discuss monetary policy, but CPI will be released during the blackout period,"" he added. ""If we end up in a situation where the jobs and inflation numbers present a conflicting view, the outcome of the Fed meeting could become even harder to predict.""
The Fed is hardly alone in warning of further tightening.
In an interview released over the weekend, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said it was ""very likely"" they would raise interest rates by 50 basis points this month and the bank had more work to do on inflation.
Australia's central bank is expected to lift its rates by 25 basis points on Tuesday, while the Bank of Canada is seen pausing having raised rates at a record pace of 425 basis points in 10 months.
Friday marks the final policy meeting for Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda before Kazuo Ueda takes the reins in April, and all eyes are on the fate of its yield curve control (YCC) stance.
""No change is expected but we should not completely rule out the chance of Kuroda going out with a bang via the BoJ announcing another tweak to the 0% YCC tolerance band,"" noted analysts at NAB in a note.
The BOJ jolted markets in December when it unexpectedly widened the allowed trading band for 10-year bond yields to between -50 and +50 basis points.
So far, Ueda has sounded dovish on the outlook for policy which has kept the yen on a softer trend. The dollar was last at 135.95 yen after touching a three-month peak of 137.10 last week.
The euro held at $1.0629 , just off its recent seven-week low of $1.0533, while the dollar index was a fraction firmer at 104.610 .
Friday's pullback in bond yields helped gold recover some ground and it was trading at $1,855 an ounce .
Oil prices dipped, perhaps disappointed by China's latest growth target.
Brent eased 33 cents to $85.50 a barrel, while U.S. crude fell 30 cents to $79.38 per barrel.SYDNEY, March 6 (Reuters) - Asian shares edged up on Monday while bond markets held their breath ahead of an update on the U.S. rate outlook from the world's most powerful central banker, and a jobs report that could decide if the next hike needs to be super-sized.There was some disappointment that Beijing chose to lowball its growth outlook with a target of 5%, rather than the 5.5%-plus favoured by the market, but the recent run of actual data has been strong enough to keep investors optimistic.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (.MIAPJ0000PUS) rose 0.8%, after bouncing 1.5% last week.Japan's Nikkei (.N225) climbed 1.0% to a three-month top, while South Korean stocks (.KS11) added 0.6% helped by a softer reading on inflation.S&P 500 futures dipped 0.1% and Nasdaq futures 0.2%, after rallying on Friday as bond yields eased back a little.Yields on 10-year Treasuries stood at 3.970%, after last week's spike to 4.09% proved tempting enough to attract buyers.Markets have become resigned to more rate rises from the Federal Reserve but are hoping it will stick with quarter-point moves rather than switch back to half-point hikes.San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly on Saturday reiterated rates would have to go up but set a high bar for moving to half-point increases.Futures imply a 72% chance the Fed will go by 25 basis points at its meeting on March 22.All of which sets the scene for Fed Chair Jerome Powell's testimony to congress on Tuesday and Wednesday, where he will no doubt be quizzed on whether larger hikes are needed.Much, however, might depend on what the February payrolls report reveals on Friday.

A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than March 22, 2023. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles.

Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company.

Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose, among other things, that: (1) the global collaboration and option agreement with Janssen Biotech, Inc., one of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, for cell-based cancer immunotherapies, (the ""Janssen Collaboration Agreement""), was less sustainable than Fate had represented to investors; (2) accordingly, certain of the clinical programs, milestone payments, and royalty payments associated with the Janssen Collaboration Agreement could not be relied upon as future revenue sources; (3) as a result, Fate had overstated the impact of the Janssen Collaboration Agreement's on Fate's long-term clinical and commercial profitability; and (4) as a result, the Company's public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. When the truth emerged, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.To join the Fate class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=11392  or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email pkim@rosenlegal.com or cases@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point.

The event will also attract nearly 33,800 visitors from 98 countries worldwide (including nearly 11,000 international visitors), of which almost are wholesalers, retailers, food service, and F&B manufacturers.   Việt Nam is expected to participate in 39 businesses at FOODEX Japan this year with many big names in the food and agriculture sector. Vietnamese firms will bring agricultural products; vegetables; fresh, processed and canned fruits; processed seafood; nutritional food from cereals; alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages; confectionery.   As one of the representatives for Vietnam's agriculture and food sector, The PAN Group will attend the exhibition with its member companies, including Khang An Foods, Aquatex Bentre, Bibica, and Lafooco.   PAN's booth will continue to recreate the sustainable value chain and introduce the most typical products, which are the pride of Việt Nam, such as shrimp, pangasius, vegetables, confectionery, cashew nuts, fresh flowers, dried fruits, coffee, rice, and traditional fish sauce.   This activity is also expected to create a favourable environment to promote trading opportunities for the group's member units in expanding domestic and international markets. PAN said this is the first time they have participated in FOODEX Japan 2023 with the group's scale though their member companies have been familiar with the event for years.   This would be an opportunity for the group to introduce agricultural and food products with high added value from Vietnam thanks to deep processing according to high standards with their own brands to the international community.   Mrs Nguyen Thi Tra My, The PAN Group's CEO, shared: ""High-end markets such as Japan, the US, and the EU have long been PAN's traditional markets. However, we consider participating in big fairs like FOODEX Japan an opportunity to expand the market and promote products and a good opportunity to reposition Vietnamese agricultural products and food internationally.   ""Previously, the world knew us as a country with large agricultural output but not appreciated for its quality. We want to prove that currently, agricultural products and foods that are deeply processed and branded in Vietnam can be confident in quality comparable to products of any country in the world market.""   A PAN representative in the confectionery sector added: ""Japan has been Bibica's traditional market for more than ten years. We entered the market from the position of processing goods. There are very popular Bibica branded products in the Japanese market, such as Cherry soft candy.   ""Even during the COVID-19 pandemic, Bibica has products that have never seen a decline in sales in the Japanese market. In 2022, Bibica recorded an increase of 32 per cent over the previous year and increased by 111 per cent compared to 2019 before the pandemic. I hope these numbers inspire Vietnamese businesses to confidently exploit high-end international markets like Japan, the US, or the EU.""   In addition to the main trading activities from March 7-10, FOODEX Japan includes many specialised exhibitions and business connection activities continuously during the 4-day event. In 2022, Japan was Vietnam's fourth largest trading partner, with a total import-export turnover of US$50 billion. The culture and cuisine of Vietnam and Japan are also highly appreciated for their harmony, which serves as a foundation to open up great cooperation opportunities in agriculture and food.

SINGAPORE -  Media OutReach - 6 March 2023 -  Zoho Corporation, a leading global technology company, today unveiled its new collaboration experience, Trident, as well as strengthened collaboration technologies to offer businesses easier ways to communicate across channels, reduce tool-ambiguity, and improve an organization's overall digital adoption.            Establishing itself as a central work hub or virtual headquarters, Zoho Workplace is a unified office platform that combines collaboration, productivity, and communications tools. It is now a flexible, full-featured business mail and cloud office suite that is built on a common data model and unified through search and AI, enabling users to operate collaboratively and seamlessly through applications.   Commenting on the continued innovation, Gibu Mathew, VP and GM of Zoho APAC notes, ""In the past year, Zoho Workplace adoption has accelerated in the APAC region as businesses of all sizes transition to digital-forward, hybrid work. With a clear focus on continued innovation, Zoho is well-positioned to be a growth partner for businesses. The goal of Zoho Workplace is to enable businesses to unify their work to a point where the line between apps disappears. It's heartening to see so many new businesses join the Zoho family, using Zoho Workplace as their customizable center of gravity.""   Zoho Workplace has grown 38% year-over-year in APAC and now has more than 16 million users worldwide. This substantial growth is attributed to increasing business demand for simplified, streamlined solutions that maintain utmost standards for user privacy as well as rising costs from other collaboration platform providers.

Here's a look at what's new:      Zoho Trident is a brand new collaboration, productivity and communication experience that combines mail, messages, audio/video calls, calendar, tasks and more into the same place.

The Zoho Voice platform is now a full        Phone System integrated directly within team collaboration app Zoho Cliq and web conferencing app Zoho Meeting. This allows employees to make direct line calls and send SMS messages, as well as pick up inbound calls across the apps.       Zoho Webinar is now part of the Zoho Meeting web conferencing app that will let you broadcast yourselves to hundreds of attendees and engage with them using Polls and Q&As.             Zoho is releasing a new AI-based grammar tool,        BluePencil. This brings writing suggestions and a text editor which can be used on any third-party webpage.       Universal Drag & Drop functionality lets users save time and improves users experience doing things across collaboration channels. Drag an email attachment and drop it to your colleague's chat to send it directly, for example.       Mobile Device Management capabilities and        OTP-restricted Emails have been added to the workplace suite as Zoho focuses on security.       TrueSync has been added to Zoho Workdrive so that hard drive storage limits are no longer a concern. TrueSync creates a mirror of all WorkDrive files and folders on the desktop so you can seamlessly switch between the cloud and your computer. You can access files locally and make changes without using up hard drive space.           Zoho Workplace Pricing:   Zoho Workplace is available in three editions: Standard is $3 per user per month.

No one was found, and a search and rescue mission was carried out.The bow of the fishing boat, Hsin Chang Fa No. 88 (新長發88), was discovered seven days after the boat went missing, with Japanese search and rescue staff recovering the body of an unidentified fisherman. Authorities fear the Taiwanese captain and the rest of the six-person Indonesian crew may be lost at sea with their whereabouts unknown.Upon receiving the report of a capsized vessel, Japan's Coast Guard launched a search and rescue operation. Taiwan’s Coast Guard followed by dispatching the CG-125 Lienchiang (連江艦) rescue vessel to assist the search in distant waters.Hsin Chang Fa No. 88 departed from Badouzi Fishing Harbor at 11 a.m. on Feb. 27 to fish around the Diaoyutai Islands. According to past fishing records, the vessel typically fishes for 15 to 20 days at sea before returning to Badouzi.The latest accident at sea comes after another vessel, Lien Sheng Fa (聯昇發) overturned on Feb. 26 with a Taiwanese captain and 15 Indonesian crew members still missing. A lifeboat from the 98-ton vessel was deployed and there is a chance the crew could still be alive.And earlier on Feb. 17, another fishing vessel, Sheng Feng No. 128 (昇豐), went missing with one Taiwanese and five Indonesian fishermen going missing 767 km northwest of Palau.",2023/03/06,1357,Society

He claimed he would broadcast the carnage live on Facebook and told followers to ""just wait for the show.""Shao, in the second post, claimed that he had prepared a dagger and changed the location of the killings to the Taoyuan Airport. He repeated his previous graphic descriptions and included a photo of a large knife.Netizens took screenshots and reported the threats to the police.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4827660,Taiwan's eased school mask mandate Q&A,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwan on Monday (March 6) lifted its indoor mask mandate for schools at all levels, but there are three settings in which masks will still be required and schools have the option to modify rules as needed.After imposing mask requirements for over 800 days, the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) largely ended the mask measures for schools at all levels, kindergartens, after-school institutions, and cram schools. Generally, faculty, staff, and students can decide whether or not they want to wear masks in the classrooms, but there are some exceptions. The following is a Q&A on the new policy posted by SET News.Masks are now optional in campus classrooms, but they are still required in school health centers and when taking school buses and shuttle buses, according to the CECC.Ministry of Education (MOE) Chief Secretary Liao Hsin-kuo (廖興國) said that when there is a possible need for masks in special fields or lectures, the school may decide whether to implement a mask requirement. However, school administrators must first explain this rule change to teachers and students and not implement it unilaterally through administrative procedures to avoid dissatisfaction among teachers and students.CECC head Victor Wang (王必勝) pointed out that the MOE's principle for loosening the mask mandate is ""independent mask-wearing,"" respecting the freedom of students and teachers to decide when they will wear masks. In addition, Wang said that subjects that would require the wearing of masks would be set by the organizer or responsible department.He said that there is no penalty for ""independent mask-wearing,"" and stressed that people should mutually respect each other's choices when it comes to wearing or not wearing a mask.Under this program, classmates of students who test positive for COVID can continue to attend in-person classes as long as they are asymptomatic and receive a negative result from a rapid antigen test.Liao said that the relevant departments will be invited to simplify the content of this program in the near future. Liao said it is possible that the airport model will be followed in which rapid antigen tests will only be distributed to those who request them, but he said the implementation period must still be discussed with relevant units before it is announced.Philip Lo (羅一鈞), deputy head of the CECC's medical response division, said after campus mask rules are relaxed, the center will pay attention to the situation with infections in schools and monitor children aged 6 to 12 and 12 to 17 to determine whether there is a sudden spike in cases. However, Lo said that the preliminary assessment by the CECC is that the loosening of mask rules will not impact the overall trend of the COVID outbreak in Taiwan.",2023/03/06,2343,Society

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4827663,Deloitte Consulting releases 2023 China Consumer Insight and Market Outlook White Paper,"HONG KONG, CHINA -  Media OutReach - 6 March 2023 - In the past two decades, China's economy has thrived, people's living standards have steadily improved, and the consumer market has been full of dynamism. Consumption is the biggest contributor to China's economic growth today.   In 2023, China's consumer market will face growth challenges given the impact of pandemic fluctuations and the arrival of the post-pandemic era. On the other hand, the Government has continuously introduced policies to expand domestic demand, encourage new forms of consumption, and drive high-quality growth. This reflects how China's consumer market is undergoing rapid upgrading and innovation in consumption patterns and business models, ushering in a new phase of development. Against this backdrop, Deloitte Consulting has released the  2023 China Consumer Insight and Market Outlook White Paper.   ""Deloitte Consulting has been cultivating China's consumer market for a long time. The white paper provides an analysis of the predictable future development trends of the consumer goods and retail industry based on changes in consumer behavior and attitudes during the post-pandemic era and technological advancements. We hope to help consumer goods and retail companies deepen their understanding of consumers and the market, explore new consumer trends, and grasp the keys to winning in the market"" says  Woolf Huang, Deloitte Consulting China Clients, Industries, & Markets leader.   The insights of the white paper are based on the nationwide consumer survey data: This study was conducted in November 2022, using an online questionnaire, with respondents ranging in age from 18 to 73. The questionnaire covers consumer background information, consumer attitudes, shopping behaviors, lifestyles, interests, values, and more. This online survey sample set quota is based on the demographic structure data from the Seventh National Population Census, with a sample size of 2,000 covering 301 cities or autonomous regions from the 1st- to the 5th-tier in China.   Based on the analysis first-hand survey data, the  2023 China Consumer Insight and Market Outlook White Paper highlights five major trends for the consumer goods and retail industry in 2023.  Michael Deng, Deloitte Consulting China Consumer Products and Retail, Wholesale & Distribution Industry leader, introduced the report.   The top 5 trends in consumer goods and retail   Return to rational consumption: In the aftermath of the pandemic, consumers have become more pragmatic and rational in their purchasing decisions, based on reduced consumption needs and increased economic pressures and life uncertainties. They have reduced impulse purchases, prioritizing product quality and value, taking advantage of promotions, and comparing prices across multiple sellers before making a purchase.   With much more information available, consumers are taking recommendations with a pinch of salt, making their own choices after careful research and comparison instead of blindly following trends. This shift in consumer behavior favors domestic brands, which are seen as more cost-effective and have a better understanding of Chinese consumer habits.   The pursuit of pleasing experiences: As people have become more affluent and product and channel options have increased, consumers today not only seek to satisfy their material needs, but also hope to achieve physical and emotional satisfaction and pleasure by seeking out pleasing experiences. Social attributes are now deeply embedded across the entire shopping journey, where consumers enjoy interactions at various stages such as information research, decision-making, and experience sharing.   Meanwhile, many consumers value bricks-and-mortar retail for its more transparent information, more intuitive and hands-on experience, and immediate access. They are increasingly concerned about the security of their personal information and are often frustrated with the current state of privacy protection, prompting them to take active steps to protect their privacy and interests.   Embracing diverse innovation: The rise of technology, changes in the social environment, and policy incentives have created fertile ground for business model innovation. A variety of new retail channels and scenarios have emerged this decade, ushering in the era of the ""Now Consumer"" who pursues new lifestyles and consumption habits, embraces innovation, enjoys trying new things, and is highly energetic and receptive. Live streaming, instant retail, and home leisure consumption have become popular trends in new retail channels and buying scenarios.   Deloitte Consulting's research found that live streaming and instant retail are increasingly becoming the norm for consumers. The pandemic led consumers to passively adopt ""home mode,"" unlocking various opportunities for leisure consumption at home. Consumers have discovered the joy of these at-home activities and are pursuing them. The rise of the ""home economy"" could become a long-term consumption focus.   Being green and sustainable: China's promotion of green and sustainable development, including its efforts towards advancing peak carbon and carbon neutrality, its participation in global climate change governance, and its pursuit of a harmonious relationship between society and nature, has led to widespread public acceptance and recognition of the concept of greenness and sustainability. This concept is also reflected in consumption patterns, as consumers are aware of the social responsibility associated with their consumption behavior.   Following the proposal of ""promoting green consumption and establishing green, low-carbon production and lifestyle"" by the 20th National Congress, consumers have increasingly incorporated the idea of greenness and sustainability into their consumption. Some consumers are also willing to pay a premium for green consumption, which is expected to remain a lasting trend for consumers as awareness and adoption of sustainable practices in consumption behavior continue to grow.   Pursuing technological advances: The past decade has been a period of rapid internet development, with continuous innovation in Internet technology, service forms, and business models. With the advent of the ""new infrastructure,"" the retail ecosystem is becoming more digitalized, intelligent, and efficient. The widespread adoption of the latest innovations in underlying technologies, such as 5G, cloud computing, IoT, big data, and artificial intelligence, is propelling advances in retail technology.   Chinese consumers exhibit strong curiosity and acceptance of new technologies and are eager to experience the convenience and innovations they bring, creating a positive feedback loop that drives even further advances in technology. For example, around 2015, the sharing economy began to boom, with shared bikes, power banks, massage chairs, and more entering the market. This highlighted the strong ability of the internet to allocate physical resources to meet consumer needs. Around 2016, visual media such as live streaming and short videos further enriched internet services, satisfying consumers' entertainment needs while providing new business models for traffic monetization.   Today, mobile internet is widely popular, and the proportion of elderly internet users is surging. Consumers remain enthusiastic about new technologies and look forward to the maturation and application of the Metaverse.   Michael Deng says, ""Based on the above trends derived from Chinese consumer insights, Deloitte suggests that to better serve consumers, consumer goods and retail companies should strive to capture shares of consumers' time, minds, and wallets 24/7, both online and offline. We present the following recommendations for consumer goods and retail companies:        focus on product value for money;         lead with a strong value proposition and build brand trust to win recognition;         build a brand's private domain, lay out Omni-channel consumer operations, and create unique brand experiences;         prioritize omni-channel integration to meet diverse consumer needs; and         create an open business ecosystem that can adapt to changing consumer needs.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4827664,Taiwan's frontline troops on Matsu complain of food shortages,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Soldiers from Matsu’s Defense Command have made their complaints public about substandard food rations.Writing in the sand on a local beach that meals are canned food with no meat options, their complaints attracted the attention of legislators, who expressed concern about the lack of fresh food supply, especially during times of escalating cross-strait tensions, per UDN.Matsu residents also chimed in, noting that complaints about the high price of eggs by many Taiwan citizens are nothing new to those living in Matsu who lack access to most grocery supplies and are accustomed to inflated food prices.Juguang Township Mayor Chen Leli (陳樂禮) confirmed food shortages are due to rising transport costs as the number of cargo ships servicing the area has been halved. He appealed to the central government for help, per UDN.Chen said the county government previously subsidized the delivery of food and materials to Juguang, though these funds have been cut. He called for reinstatement of such aid to assist cargo ships delivering food and materials to the area.Army Command Headquarter said on Sunday night (March 5) that a cargo ship leased to Matsu’s Juguang military base has completed repairs in the past two days. It added that a meat shortage does indeed exist at a Juguang market, with troops having no choice but to eat canned food for two days.A soldier stationed in Matsu posted in a Whistleblower’s Commune Facebook group that said the cargo ship had not been operational for a month, claiming some soldiers felt deprived of food and felt a sense of abandonment by the Ministry of National Defense (MND).KMT Legislator Chen Hsueh-sheng (陳雪生) said the MND should have taken measures to ensure Matsu's food supplies. Chen pledged to ask Defense Minister Chiu Kuo-chen (邱國正) such questions during an appearance before the Legislature’s Foreign and Defense Committee on Monday (March 6).",2023/03/06,2415,Society

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4827683,Taiwan’s Zengwen Reservoir drops to worrying 19% capacity,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The water levels of Zengwen Reservoir, the largest in Taiwan, have dropped to 19% and are said to be able to supply water for a mere 20 days.As of 9 a.m. on Monday (March 6), the capacity of Zengwen Reservoir which provides water supply to Chiayi and Tainan has plummeted to 19%, according to a Water Resources Agency (WRA) website monitoring the real-time status of the country’s reservoirs.However, the WRA rebutted reports about the estimated three-week period it can last, saying such reports are misleading as they did not factor in the status of Wusanto Reservoir, which sits near Zengwen Reservoir and the supply of which should be taken into account, per TVBS.A prolonged drought has contributed to the dangerously low levels of the reservoir. The amount of rainfall in the south hit a 30-year-low in 2022, and the region has seen no precipitation surpassing 200 millimeters for more than 570 days, said the WRA.Reduced water pressure has been implemented for Tainan and Chiayi, with water restrictions to kick in in Kaohsiung starting Wednesday (March 8) as part of an emergency response. Well drilling and halted irrigation, among other measures, are being taken to avoid a red water alert, meaning water rationing, for Tainan and Kaohsiung by April, per WRA.The public is urged to save water as rain is not expected for the coming weeks. Reservoirs that have plummeted to less than 25% in storage levels also include Xinshan Reservoir in Keelung, Shigang Dam in Taichung, Wushe Reservoir in Nantou, and Baihe Reservoir in Tainan.",2023/03/06,1999,Environment

Bamboos, rustic benches, butterflies, and water lilies… you won’t be able to see them the same way again.

         ""Nature of Art"" art exhibition & book launch by Inessa & Alice Kalabekova (The Fullerton Hotel Singapore)             Inspired, curated & initially exhibited at Singapore Botanic Gardens (UNESCO World Heritage Site)             Unique perspective on familiar scenes of Singapore nature. Bamboo, banana trees, butterflies, leaves, birds, flowers, and water lilies are not just decorative elements, or a backdrop to a peaceful walk. For the artist, they are animated entities, and each bush or branch can be the hiding place of a mythological creature.             Mother & daughter collaboration: art by mother & poems by 12 y.o. daughter         SINGAPORE -  Media OutReach - 6 March 2023 - Griness presents Inessa Kalabekova's solo exhibition in Singapore, called ""Nature of Art,"" from March 1 to March 31, 2023. Here the artist explores the sights and secret corners of Singapore's parks and gardens, through the medium of painting and collage. Each painting is in a dialogue with the poems of Alice Kalabekova, Inessa's young daughter, a burgeoning writer in her own's right. A book, specially published for the exhibition, will comprise both the artworks and the poems, as well as sketches and photographs.       Inessa and Alice Kalabekova exhibition Nature of Art at The Fullerton Hotel Singapore     The eighteen paintings on show have been originally exhibited in the form of prints. They were shown within the original context that inspired them, namely Singapore's Botanic Garden, in July last year. This is the first time the original artworks - plus some newest, previously unseen paintings - will be presented to a Singaporean public in a gallery setting.   In the show Inessa looks at the peculiar Singaporean natural context with child-like eyes, operating a magic spell of sorts. Bamboo, banana trees, butterflies, leaves, birds, flowers, and water lilies are not just decorative elements, or a backdrop to a peaceful walk. For her, they are animated entities, and each bush or branch can be the hiding place of a mythological creature.   Legends are indeed at the very center of Inessa's imaginary dimension. Her representations draw from both Eastern and Western traditions, ultimately converging into personal mythologies. An example is the figure of the dragon; while this is usually represented as an evil creature in Western culture, it is a rather positive one in Chinese myths. In her ouvre Inessa creates her own interpretation of the dragon, which encompasses both positive and negative elements. Of course, viewers themselves can give their interpretation of the dragon, according to their own background.   The artist says that making art is a way for her to record and express her emotional journey between her internal self and the nature of life. When Inessa tackles a new canvas, she doesn't just make a decorative piece, but rather creates a whole, complete world to share with others.   The inspiration from the paintings came to the artist as much from a direct appreciation of nature and ancient legends, as from the delicate and poignant poem written by her daughter. Involving Alice in the creative process came naturally to Inessa; her entire family is a participant in her world of art and imagination. Mother and daughter spend a lot of time together, and love to create stories about their adventures in nature. They let each their individual gaze on their surroundings influence each other, and together they are able to transform the most mundane aspects into moments of beauty and wonder. It's really a process of co-creation, where the pure stare of the young girl meets the trained – but just as sincere and spontaneous – eye of the professional artist. It's not a coincidence that in Inessa's work, childhood memories are often recurring, and the past imagination merges with the present.   In the context of Singapore, this process and compassionate gaze takes up even more meaning. We know that what we call nature (forest, the shores, vegetation) has been artificially modified in Singapore since the '70s, when the government started presenting Singapore as a ""Garden City"", later to be rebranded as ""City in a Garden"". The whole City in the Garden project has been about recreating a natural environment with a strong artificial element akin to urban planning. So what we have today in Singapore is that nature - in order to simply exist - needs to be either decorative or efficient.   In this context, Inessa's work creates a special enchantment; she is able to find the beauty in the efficient, transmuting something grown and modified to be practical and transactional, into a place of beauty, possibility, and storytelling.   The artist was born in the Central Asian country of Kazakhstan, part of the former USSR. She studied not only visual art, but also music, dance, and architecture academically. This varied and diverse education provided her with a synesthetic understanding, developing her capacity to translate music into visuals and movement, as all these forms of expressions are animated, in her view, by the same energy source.   At the time the educational model in Kazakhstan was the Russian one, with a big stress on technique, versus concept. The artist had the chance to focus on the conceptual aspect of her practice at a later time, when she enrolled in the prestigious art college Central Saint Martins in London. This opened up the artist to a variety of expressive possibilities. She complemented her artistic studies in Oxford, where she learned about the nitty-gritty of building herself as an artist within the art system.   Over the years Inessa has exhibited internationally and her artworks were collected by museums such as the Haegeumgang Theme Museum in South Korea, as well as private collections in over eleven countries, including of Japan, Australia, Portugal, Austria, USA, and Dubai. Among her most recent awards, she won the International Art Competition ""Waters"" at Art Room Gallery in 2020 and was a finalist of the Prisma Art Prize International in Rome. Last year a Special Mention Award at Art Vue Foundation and Honorable Mention, Palm Art Award, Germany.   Being classically trained and with a big awareness of painterly tradition, it's only natural that Inessa would start a piece from the composition. A very important part, the foundation of the artist's inner world, are her sketchbooks, full of images as well as quotes and ideas. Some depictions are from real life – some of the initial inspiration for the ""Nature of Art"" series have been made  en plein air - or they might be images and phrases or stories that just pop into her mind, and are deemed suitable to be translated into painting. From the initial sketch to the final piece, the idea might change completely. The following steps involve balancing colours within the composition. The collage is then built by overlapping layers of paper cuts on top of those colours.   The layering of different strata involves also going back to the sketchbooks, to retrace the original idea. It's really a back-and-forth, based on a strong intuition; the artist can feel which part is working and which one doesn't. In the collages, Inessa uses also some little tricks that she learned from classical painting. One is the interplay between warm and cold colours, which create vibrancy and movement, a sense of aliveness. Although they look very contemporary, in Inessa's paintings there is always a subtle dialogue with the masters of the past, especially Marc Chagall, Sargent, Rembrandt, Fechin, Carel Fabritius, William Morris. The latter is directly referenced in the use of his famous wallpaper patterns as part of the collage.   With a passion for collecting items and images, Inessa incorporates not only wallpapers, but also postcards, musical scores, and maps within the canvas. There are also a lot of easter eggs and references inside the collages. For example, the artist's passion for museums is found in the use of museum tickets, which are not immediately visible, but revels themselves to the viewer slowly. The cues Inessa inserts in the canvas are meant to unfold, rather than be appreciated at a glance. This corresponds to the artist's approach to the technique, which is laborious and involves many steps; similarly, also the appreciation of the canvases promotes a slower, more mindful approach, in contrast with the fast-consuming culture that in starting to permeate the art world, as well as societies at large.   As Lao Tzu famously said: ""Nature does not hurry, yet everything is accomplished."" Going against the grain, the artist defines ""The Nature of Art"" as a ""slow art exhibition, meant to be cosy."" When preparing a show, she always considers the location, and this is perhaps due to her architectural background. Changing the exhibiting space from the Botanic Garden to an exhibiting space, naturally changes also the fruition of the paintings by visitors.   The space of the East Garden Gallery, within The Fullerton Gallery Hotel Singapore is small and intimate, it and carries with it the history of the heritage building before it was transformed into a world-class hotel. The history of places and objects is part of the storytelling element central to Inessa's artistic vision. It might now be an entire story told by one canvas, other times is just a hint, like a song that evokes a possible unfolding of a story, without being too descriptive.   One of the most interesting elements of ""The Nature of Art"" exhibition is to bring the magic powder of spirit and imagination, to a context that is goal-oriented and highly bureaucratic. The question the artist seems to ask is: what is that propels the world forward? Transactions, efficiency and economics, or rather love, curiosity and storytelling?
