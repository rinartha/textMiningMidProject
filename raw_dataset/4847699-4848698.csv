It combines the concepts of traditional celebrity endorsements with modern content-driven marketing strategies. In recent years, marketers have begun to go beyond traditional celebrities for product endorsements, collaborating with online celebrities/influencers. This is a direct result of these influencers’ growing number of social media followers and their capacity to affect their followers’/fans’ purchasing habits. The increasing usage of the internet for advertising techniques has transformed corporate models and created new revenue streams. Customers’ easy access to high-speed, low-cost internet connections provides marketers with a new avenue to reach out to target groups, resulting in the emergence of influencer marketing strategies.Marketers and brands can create more targeted advertising campaigns by leveraging these promotion strategies, improving customer experience and business relationships. Consumer demand is driven by product authenticity and the availability of dependable goods and services. Customers are constantly being forced to acquire things via traditional marketing and promotion approaches. Traditional methods can result in a negative brand image. Furthermore, consumers’ transition to the over-the-top (OTT) sector and other social media channels has decentralized the consumer base across channels, resulting in expensive marketing costs and no return on investment (ROI).As a result, businesses are increasingly implementing successful marketing strategies that reach end consumers without disturbing them. Influencer marketing is one of the most effective marketing tactics for reaching direct customers via macro and micro influencers and forming strong bonds between customers and brands. Customers trust brands that are backed by celebrities, bloggers, vloggers, and well-known individuals via social media channels. According to ClickZ, 22% of consumers in the 18-34 age bracket bases their purchasing decisions on celebrity endorsements. According to the figures above, organizations’ brand image might be harmed if they betray their customers’ confidence. By providing quality and transparency, businesses have a significant opportunity to win consumer trust and acquire new customers.Major market player included in this report are:

Herpes simplex viruses come in two varieties: HSV-1 and HSV-2. Blisters on the genital organs, blisters in the mouth, lips, and other regions, itching or tingling in the infected areas, pelvic discomfort, vaginal discharge, and other symptoms are all frequent genital herpes symptoms. Therapy options for genital herpes include medication, episodic treatment, and suppressive treatment, among others. Commercially available antiviral medications for the treatment of genital herpes include Acyclovir, Famciclovir, and Valacyclovir.Over the projected period, the rising frequency of sexually transmitted diseases, particularly genital herpes, is likely to drive demand for genital herpes therapy. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, genital herpes affects roughly 50 million people in the United States. During the projected period, factors such as rising genital herpes diagnosis rates in emerging nations and expanding clinical trials of genital herpes vaccines have further fueled the expansion of the genital herpes market. Sanofi Pasteur, for example, is working on a herpes vaccine called HSV529 in partnership with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The vaccine is categorised as a replication-defective virus, which means it has all of the HSV virus’s components minus two key proteins required in viral DNA replication, UL5 and UL29. GlaxoSmithKline plc started phase 1 human clinical trials for their investigational HSV-2 vaccine in March 2021, with the goal of determining the reactogenicity, safety, and immunogenicity of four different dosage levels of the vaccine in healthy adults aged 18 to 40.Furthermore, rising government support for the development of novel therapeutics for the treatment of genital herpes is expected to drive market expansion during the forecast period. Furthermore, in developed countries, accurate diagnostic techniques such as competitive polymerase chain reactions (PCR), DNA enzyme immunoassay hybridization, and real-time PCR assays are widely utilized to identify STIs. These tests are effective for diagnosing asymptomatic infections, which will boost demand for genital herpes therapy and propel the industry forward. Inadequate reimbursement and a poor treatment seeking rate for genital herpes, on the other hand, will stifle market growth between 2021 and 2027.

These components are required for the operation of any electrical device. As a result of the rise in electronic devices such as smartphones and tablets, the CNT market will grow. According to JEITA, total global output by the electronics and IT industries is predicted to increase 11% year on year in 2021 to $3,360.2 billion, with production increasing 5% to $3,536.6 billion in 2022. Carbon nanotube demand is predicted to rise due to present market growth in the electronics industry (CNTs). Due to the transition to EV (electric vehicles) and the growing percentage of electrical components in autos, and the rising demand for eco-friendly products in the automotive and aerospace industries, electronic components and devices are predicted to grow across regions.
Medical Sector is Anticipated to Witness Fastest Growth in Carbon Nanotubes Market
The medical sector is projected to witness the fastest growth in the carbon nanotubes (CNT) market during the forecast period 2022-2028. The carbon nanotubes play a significant role in various medical procedures such as transdermal drug delivery, cancer treatment, proteomics, others (cardiac autonomic regulation, platelet activation, tissue regeneration & others). The use of CNTs with biological systems can bring about advancements in medical science, especially diagnostics, biosensing, drug delivery, and disease treatments. Such extensive usage of CNTs anticipated propelling the market growth of the carbon nanotubes market in the medical sector.
The Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes (MWNT) Segment to Bolster Carbon Nanotubes Industry Growth
The Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNT) market catered to the largest market share in the global carbon nanotubes market and is expected to follow the trend from 2022-2028. MWNCTs are widely used in energy storage (batteries and supercapacitors), as well as conductive copper. When MWNTs are used in a composite structure, they become highly conductive. On the other side, the outer wall is the only structural component that can conduct electricity, whereas the inside walls are not. MWNTs have a large aspect ratio, with lengths nearly 100 times and, in certain instances, much longer than the diameter. The aspect ratio, degree of entanglement, and straightness of the tubes all influence their performance and application. Hence the advantages mentioned above support the market growth of MWNT segmental growth.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847744,Paraxylene Market Global Industry Analysis and Forecast 2023 To 2031,"The paraxylene market has been on a growth trajectory for the past few years, driven by the demand for plastics in various industries. The market has witnessed advancements in production technologies and the introduction of bio-based paraxylene in several bioplastics. According to a recent report by Report Ocean, the global paraxylene market was 50.1 million tons in 2021 and is projected to reach 71.1 million tons by 2028, growing at a CAGR of 5.2% over the analysis period of 2022-2028.The growth of the paraxylene market can be attributed to the increasing demand for dimethyl terephthalic acid, terephthalic acid, and other derivatives of PTA. Additionally, the demand for PET bottles, fibers, resin, and other products from various sectors such as food and beverage, personal care and cosmetics, textile, and pharmaceuticals, is expected to boost market growth during the forecast period.Download Free Sample of This Strategic Report: https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=MR294However, the growth of the paraxylene market is also accompanied by environmental concerns. Paraxylene has been known to have hazardous impacts on aquatic organisms and their habitat. The discharge of paraxylene into water bodies can cause long-term damage to the ecosystem and aquatic life. Therefore, it is crucial to have proper regulations in place to ensure responsible production and disposal of paraxylene.Despite the environmental concerns, the paraxylene market is expected to grow in the coming years due to its widespread applications in various industries. The market players are expected to continue investing in R&D to come up with eco-friendly alternatives to paraxylene. In conclusion, the paraxylene market presents numerous growth opportunities, but it is essential to balance this growth with environmental responsibility.Surging Demand for PET and Polyester by Various End-User Driving the Global Paraxylene Market GrowthThe ever-expanding interest for polyester as well as PET across several end-use industries organizations is likely to bolster the demand throughout the coming few years. Moreover, growing interest for sifted terephthalic corrosive (PTA) for polyester creation is anticipated to offer spur to the paraxylene market. The huge usage of PET among individuals, especially in the Asia Pacific region, is highlighting the market growth. The surging adoption of PET containers and other packaging materials, credited to them being viewed as protected and prudent, in the food and beverage industry has played an important role in the surge in the market growth. Furthermore, the large-scale espousal of polyester in the material business world has strengthened the demand for paraxylene in the global market. The substantial usage of paraxylene in making PTA is expected to aid the rapid expansion of the market during the forecast period. Additionally, the limitless usage of PET in numerous applications in the material business such as in production of goods, dresses, specialized materials is significantly aiding the growth of the global paraxylene market.Purified Terephthalic Acid (PTA) Accounted for The Largest Market Share and Likely to Grow with The Highest CAGRBy product type, the global paraxylene market is divided into purified terephthalate acid (PTA), dimethyl terephthalate (DMT), and others. Amidst the segmentation, PTA acted as the sole driver of the paraxylene market as about 97% of the paraxylene demand went into PTA manufacturing, thus accounting for the largest market share in 2021. PTA has netter financial nature and lower capital cost, making it an ideal feedstock for numerous end-use businesses. Consequently, the polyester makers prefer PTA. However, demand from assembling of designing polymers, for instance, polybutylene terephthalate is projected to bolster the growth of Dimethyl Terephthalate during the proposed forecast period.Get a Sample Report: https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=MR294Impact of COVID-19 On The Global Paraxylene MarketAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the world witnessed one of the worst recessions since WW2.

Nevertheless, with the improving market circumstances in the post COVID era, the growth of the Paraxylene market is likely to recover during the forecast period.Asia-Pacific Region Is Expected to Grow with The Highest CAGR in The Global Paraxylene Market.In terms of regional analysis, the global Paraxylene market has been classified into North America, Europe, the Asia-Pacific, Latin America and the Middle East, and Africa. Amidst the segmentation, the Asia-Pacific region is expected to be the largest growing market in the global paraxylene owing to the factors such as rising urbanization, high population growth, rise in disposable income, and the increasing demand for fast-moving consumer goods. China, India, as well as the U.S. comprise some of the largest paraxylene market globally. Moreover, China accounted for the greatest market share in terms of regional consumption of paraxylene.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847795,Asian shares mostly rise on relief over US bank strength,"TOKYO (AP) — Asian shares were mostly higher on Tuesday as investors got some relief from worries over troubled U.S. banks with a planned takeover of failed Silicon Valley Bank.Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 lost 0.1% to 27,456.98. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 jumped 1.1% to 7,036.20. South Korea's Kospi added 0.4% to 2,419.43. Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose nearly 0.4% to 19,644.68, while the Shanghai Composite inched up less than 0.1% to 3,249.39.“Asian equities were positive on Tuesday, lifted by mostly higher major indices in the previous session. Receding fears surrounding the banking crisis and surging oil prices led to solid risk-taking flows,” Anderson Alves at ActivTrades said in a report.Markets have been in turmoil following Silicon Valley Bank's collapse, the second-largest U.S. bank failure in history, earlier this month, and then the third-largest failure, by New York-based Signature Bank.Investors have been hunting for which banks could be next to fall as the system creaks under the pressure of much higher interest rates.On Wall Street, the S&P 500 eked out a 0.2% gain to 3,977.53 after having been up by as much as 0.8%. Banks and energy stocks led the gainers in the benchmark index, outweighing losses in technology and communications companies.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.6% to 32,432.08, while the Nasdaq composite fell 0.5%, to 11,768.84, reflecting losses in Google parent Alphabet and other tech companies. Gainers outnumbered decliners on the New York Stock Exchange by nearly 3-1. The S&P and Nasdaq are coming off two straight weekly gains.First Citizens Bank's stock soared 53.7% after it said it would buy most of Silicon Valley Bank, whose failure sparked the industry’s furor earlier this month. As part of the deal, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. agreed to share some of the losses that may arise from some of the loans First Citizens is buying.Other banks that investors have highlighted as the next potential victims of a debilitating exodus of customers also strengthened.First Republic Bank jumped 11.8% and PacWest Bancorp rose 3.5%. Most of the focus in the U.S. has been on banks that are below the size of those that are seen as “too big to fail.”A broader worry has been that all the weakness for banks could cause a pullback in lending to small and midsized businesses across the country. That in turn could lead to less hiring, less growth and a higher risk of a recession. Many economists were already expecting an economic downturn before all the struggles for banks.“Unfortunately this is what happens when you tighten policy that quickly,” Amanda Agati, chief investment officer of PNC Asset Management Group, said about the past year's swift rise in interest rates. “Things break in the system. Some of the weakest links are starting to show up.”The Federal Reserve has pulled its key overnight rate to a range of 4.75% to 5%, up from virtually zero at the start of last year. It indicated last week that the troubles in the banking system could end up acting like rate hikes on their own, by slowing lending.Huge, quick swings in expectations for the Fed have caused historic-sized moves in the bond market.Yields jumped Monday in their latest lunge. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which helps set rates for mortgages and other important loans, rose to 3.53% from 3.37% late Friday. It was above 4% earlier this month.Lower rates can act like steroids for stocks, and technology and other high-growth stocks tend to get a particularly big boost. That has helped the S&P 500, which is dominated by such Big Tech stocks as Apple and Microsoft.Other areas of the market that don’t benefit from such Big Tech stocks have been weaker. The Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks, for example, is on track for a 7.6% loss this month versus a 0.2% gain for the S&P 500.The Russell outgained the broader market Monday, however, adding 1.1%, to 1,753.67.In energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude lost 2 cents to $72.79 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It gained $3.55 to $72.81 per barrel on Monday.Brent crude, the international standard, fell 21 cents to $77.91 a barrel.In currency trading, the U.S. dollar fell to 130.62 Japanese yen from 131.56 yen. The euro cost $1.0813, up from $1.0804.——AP Business Writers Stan Choe, Damian J. Troise and Alex Veiga contributed to this report.",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847796,"Mississippi tornado victims wonder, 'How can we rebuild?'","ROLLING FORK, Miss. (AP) — The tornado that collapsed the roof and two walls of Jermaine Wells’ Mississippi home also hurled a massive tractor tire that landed near him in the living room as his wife huddled in the laundry room.The couple survived the Friday night storm, but as they picked through the ruins of their one-story home Monday in Rolling Fork, he said they're not sure how they're going to pay for daily expenses, let alone long-term recovery.Wells, 50, drives a backhoe for a road department in another county, and he said he doesn't get paid if he doesn't work. His wife, a cashier at a local store, gathered loose coins as he looked for clothing in the rubble.“I can’t even get to work. I don’t have no vehicle, no nothing,"" Wells said. “How can we rebuild something that we don’t have nothing to build our foundation with?”The disaster makes life even more difficult in this economically struggling area. Mississippi is one of the poorest states in the U.S., and the majority-Black Delta has long been one of the poorest parts of Mississippi — a place where many people work paycheck to paycheck, often in jobs connected to agriculture.Two of the counties walloped by the tornado, Sharkey and Humphreys, are among the most sparsely populated in the state, with only a few thousand residents in communities scattered across wide expanses of cotton, corn and soybean fields. Sharkey's poverty rate is 35%, and Humphreys' is 33%, compared with about 19% for Mississippi and less than 12% for the entire United States.People in poverty are vulnerable after disasters not only because they lack financial resources but also because they often don’t have friends or family who can afford to provide long-term shelter, said the Rev. Starsky Wilson, president and CEO of Children’s Defense Fund, a national group that advocates policies to help low-income families.“We have to make sure people with power — policymakers — pay attention to and keep their attention on people that are often unseen because they are poor, because they are Black, because they are rural,” Wilson told The Associated Press on Monday.On Monday, the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency revised the state death toll from the tornado to 21, down from 25. The agency said the new number is based on deaths confirmed by coroners. MEMA spokeswoman Allie Jasper said the agency does not know of any people still reported missing. One person was killed in Alabama.Preliminary assessments show 313 structures in Mississippi were destroyed and more than 1,000 were affected in some way, the Federal Emergency Management Agency told emergency managers Monday.The tornado destroyed many homes and businesses in Rolling Fork and the nearby town of Silver City, leaving mounds of lumber, bricks and twisted metal. The local housing stock was already tight, and some who lost their homes said they will live with friends or relatives. Mississippi opened more than a half-dozen shelters to temporarily house people displaced by the tornado.The tornado obliterated the modest one-story home that Kimberly Berry shared with her two daughters in the Delta flatlands about 15 miles (24 kilometers) outside Rolling Fork. It left only the foundation and random belongings — a toppled refrigerator, a dresser and matching nightstand, a bag of Christmas decorations, some clothing.During the storm, Berry and her 12-year-old daughter prayed inside a nearby church that was barely damaged, while her 25-year-old daughter survived in Rolling Fork. Berry shook her head as she looked at the remains of their material possessions. She said she’s grateful she and her children are still alive.“I can get all this back. It’s nothing,” said Berry, 46, who works as a supervisor at a catfish growing and processing operation. “I’m not going to get depressed about it.”She spent the weekend with friends and family sorting through salvageable items. Her sister, Dianna Berry, said her own home a few miles away was undamaged. She works at a deer camp, and she said her boss has offered to let Kimberly Berry and her daughters live there for as long as they need.President Joe Biden issued an emergency declaration for Mississippi on Sunday, making federal funding available to hardest-hit areas. But Craig Fugate, who headed FEMA when Barack Obama was president, said it's important to remember that the agency will not pay for all expenses after a disaster.“In those communities where people don’t have insurance and the homes were destroyed, their ability to do recovery will be tested,” Fugate said.FEMA provides temporary housing and helps with some uninsured losses, but he said the agency is not designed to replace everything if homes are uninsured or underinsured. Long-term recovery will be heavily dependent on money from Housing and Urban Development.“That money won’t flow fast,” he said.In recent years, FEMA has moved to reduce barriers so that “all people, including those from vulnerable and underserved communities, are better able to access our assistance,” said FEMA spokesperson Jeremy Edwards. He cited agency changes expanding the types of documents survivors can provide to verify they lived in or own a particular home.Marcus T. Coleman Jr., who heads the Center for Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships with the Department of Homeland Security, said after visiting Rolling Fork he's concerned about both the mental health and financial challenges for people struggling in the tornado's aftermath. “Disasters often exacerbate preexisting inequities,” said Coleman.Denise Durel heads United Way of Southwest Louisiana, where residents are still recovering from hurricanes Laura and Delta that struck in 2020. The organization has been helping people rebuild damaged homes, and some were uninsured or had too little coverage.“Just drive through town,” she said. “Blue tarps are still there. The houses are in worse shape.”Louisiana has finally received a large infusion of federal money to help those still struggling from the two 2020 hurricanes. Durel said if people didn’t register with FEMA soon after the storms, they can’t qualify for this new money. She said the application process is difficult and requires internet access, but many families were focused on gutting their homes and might not have known about registration or understood its importance.“The people in Mississippi have to understand loud and clear: Somehow you have to find a way to get those people registered with FEMA,” Durel said.__This story has been updated to correct the title for Marcus T.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847797,Australia steps toward making big polluters reduce emissions,"CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — The Australian government took a major step toward implementing a key climate policy that would force chief greenhouse gas polluters to reduce emissions, with the minor Greens party pledging their support Monday.The center-left Labor Party administration said the so-called Safeguard Mechanism reforms are essential to Australia reaching its target of reducing its emissions by 43% below 2005 levels by the end of the decade. The reforms would create a ceiling on the nation’s emissions and force Australia’s 215 biggest polluting facilities to reduce their emissions over time.The Climate Council, a leading climate communicator, described the reforms as the first Australian legislation in a decade that would regulate greenhouse gas pollution.With the support of the Greens’ 11 senators, the government only needs the backing of two unaligned or minor party senators to get the reforms through the upper chamber. Greens leader Adam Bandt said a “hard cap” on emissions would mean that half of the 116 new coal and gas projects proposed in Australia would not go ahead.The amount of greenhouse gas emissions allowed under the cap has not been made public. The cap would be reduced over time as polluters scaled back their emissions.“The Greens, through the negotiations, has secured a big hit on oil and gas,” Bandt told reporters as he confirmed his party’s support for the reforms.The legislation was passed Monday by the House of Representatives, where Labor holds a majority of seats.Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the Safeguard Mechanism “is the vehicle to achieve our commitment for 43% reduction by 2030.”Climate Change and Energy Minister Chris Bowen said that without the mechanism, Australia would only reduce its emissions by 35% by the end of the decade.“Today we’re a big step closer to passing the Safeguard Mechanism reforms through Parliament,” Bowen said.The reforms would reduce Australia's greenhouse gas emissions by 205 million metric tons (226 million U.S. tons) by 2030, equivalent to taking two-thirds of Australia’s cars off the road in the same time, Bowen said.Big polluters would be able to buy carbon credits to help achieve their emission reduction targets. But polluters that use carbon credits to achieve more than 30% of their abatement would have to explain why they were not doing more to reduce their own emissions.Opposition climate change and energy spokesperson Ted O’Brien rejected the reforms, saying capping emissions would drive Australian industrial investment offshore to China and India.“This is not a plan to decarbonize the Australian economy but rather a plan to deindustrialize it,” O’Brien said.The conservative opposition created the Safeguard Mechanism when it was in power in 2016. But the emission limits were so high that the 215 major polluters, which account for 30% of Australia’s emissions, were able to increase their emissions by 4%.The previous government had set a less ambitious target of reducing Australia’s emissions by only 26% to 28% below 2005 levels by 2030.The Climate Council welcomed the Greens' deal with the government as a historic agreement.“This will be the Federal Parliament’s first reform to genuinely cut pollution in a decade,” Climate Council CEO Amanda McKenzie said in a statement.The Australia Institute, a left-wing policy think tank, was critical that the reforms would allow some new fossil fuel projects to proceed, though fewer than under the current mechanism.Greenpeace Australia Pacific spokesperson Glenn Walker said the most important task for the Australian Parliament was to rule out new fossil fuel mines in favor of clean, future-proof industries.",2023/03/27,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847798,Netanyahu delays judicial overhaul after mass protests,"JERUSALEM (AP) — Bending to a wave of mass protests, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delayed his contentious judicial overhaul plan Monday and said he wanted ""to avoid civil war” by making time to seek a compromise with political opponents.The announcement appeared to calm some of the tensions that have fueled three tumultuous months of unrest. But it failed to address the underlying issues that have polarized the nation, and the anti-government protest movement vowed to intensify its efforts.In his prime-time address, Netanyahu, who had previously rejected calls to delay the legislation, took a more conciliatory tone than in recent speeches. He acknowledged the deep divisions in the country and said he was hitting the pause button “to prevent a rift in the nation.”“When there’s an opportunity to avoid civil war through dialogue, I, as prime minister, am taking a timeout for dialogue,” he said. He vowed to reach a “broad consensus” during the summer session of parliament, which begins on April 30.He spoke after tens of thousands of Israelis demonstrated outside parliament, and the country’s largest labor union launched a nationwide strike in a dramatic escalation of the mass protest movement against his plan.Netanyahu and his religious and ultranationalist allies presented the overhaul in January just days after forming their government, the most right-wing in Israel’s history.The proposal has plunged Israel into its worst domestic crisis in decades. Business leaders, top economists and former security chiefs have all come out against the plan, saying it is pushing the country toward an autocracy. Fighter pilots and military reservists have threatened not to report for duty, and the country’s currency, the shekel, has tumbled in value.The plan would give Netanyahu, who is on trial on corruption charges, and his allies the final say in appointing the nation’s judges. It would also give parliament, which is controlled by his allies, authority to overturn Supreme Court decisions and limit the court’s ability to review laws.Netanyahu has argued that the overhaul is needed to rein in a liberal and overly interventionist court of unelected judges. But his opponents say the package would damage the country’s system of checks and balances by concentrating power in the hands of Netanyahu’s allies. They also say that he has a conflict of interest as a criminal defendant.Tens of thousands of people, largely secular, middle-class Israelis, have regularly joined mass protests against the plan.Those demonstrations ramped up Sunday night after Netanyahu abruptly fired Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, who had urged the prime minister to put his plan on hold, citing concerns about damage to the Israeli military.The firing sparked a spontaneous outburst of anger, with tens of thousands of people taking to the streets in just one hour.Chanting “the country is on fire,” they lit bonfires on Tel Aviv’s main highway, closing the thoroughfare and many others throughout the country for hours.Demonstrators continued Monday outside the Knesset, or parliament, turning the streets surrounding the building and the Supreme Court into a roiling sea of blue-and-white Israeli flags dotted with rainbow Pride banners.“This is the last chance to stop this move into a dictatorship,” said Matityahu Sperber, 68, who joined a stream of people headed to the protest outside the Knesset. “I’m here for the fight to the end.”Israel’s main trade union, the histadrut, declared a general strike in what it said was the first time it has carried out such an action over a political issue.The chaos shut down much of the country and threatened to paralyze the economy. Departing flights from the main international airport were grounded, stranding tens of thousands of travelers.Large mall chains and universities closed their doors, and the union called for its 800,000 members to stop work in health care, transit, banking and other fields.Diplomats walked off the job at foreign missions, and local governments were expected to close preschools and cut other services. The main doctors union announced that its members would also strike.In a sign of easing tensions, the union said late Monday that it was halting the strike in response to Netanyahu’s delay.The announcement appeared to buy the embattled Netanyahu several weeks of quiet. But it was far from clear whether the disputes could be resolved.The country’s figurehead president, Isaac Herzog, said pausing the legislative blitz was “the right thing.”“This is the time for frank, serious and responsible discussion that will lead urgently to calming spirits and lowering the flames,” he said.Opposition leader Yair Lapid said he was willing to hold a “genuine dialogue” under Herzog’s sponsorship.National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, an ultranationalist who has pushed for quick passage of the package, said he would respect the delay but showed few signs of compromise.“The reform will pass,” he tweeted. “No one will scare us.”The first of a series of laws — giving the coalition control over judicial appointments — had been scheduled to pass this week.Before Netanyahu’s speech, some 20,000 right-wing Israelis attended a counter demonstration in support of the prime minister. That demonstration also took place near parliament and passed without violence.“They won’t steal the election from us,” read a flyer for event, organized by Religious Zionist party. Netanyahu said he was “moved” by the show of support.Shikma Bressler, one of the leaders of the anti-government protest movement, said the campaign would continue until the legislation is canceled.“This is just an attempt to weaken the protests in order to enact Netanyahu’s dictatorship,” she said. “Now is not the time to reduce the pressure, but to increase it.”Dozens of protesters from rival sides faced off late Monday in central Tel Aviv. The sides, kept apart by police, exchanged insults, but there was no violence. Police used a water cannon to disperse anti-government protesters.Israel’s Palestinian citizens have largely sat out the protests. Many say Israel’s democracy is tarnished by its military rule over their brethren in the West Bank and the discrimination they themselves face.The Biden administration, which has been uneasy with Netanyahu and the far-right elements of his government, welcomed the announcement as “an opportunity to create additional time and space for compromise,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters.___Associated Press reporters Tia Goldenberg and Paz Bar in Tel Aviv and Josh Boak in Washington contributed to this report.",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847799,Kings set franchise record with point in 12th straight game,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Viktor Arvidsson had two goals for the second straight game, Adrian Kempe also scored twice and the Los Angeles Kings extended their point streak to a franchise-record 12 games in a 7-6 win over the St. Louis Blues on Sunday night.Alex Iafallo and Trevor Moore also scored during a five-goal first period and Drew Doughty scored for the third consecutive game to help the Kings run their record to 10-0-2 since their last regulation loss at the New York Rangers on Feb. 26.“I think first and third period, we played pretty well,"" Kempe said. ""It was just second period where we didn’t play well at all, so good lesson for us and I think we answered pretty well in the third.”Phillip Danault had three assists, Pheonix Copley made 16 saves and the Kings also completed their best homestand ever with a 5-0-2 mark in seven games.Jordan Kyrou had two goals, and Brandon Saad, Justin Faulk, Pavel Buchnevich and Kasperi Kapanen also scored for St. Louis. But the Blues had their five-game point streak snapped. Joel Hofer was replaced after giving up five goals on 17 shots in the first period.“I think for fans, interesting game to watch. I think we show some character to almost get them back,” Buchnevich said.The Kings wasted no time jumping all over the Blues, getting goals from Arvidsson at even strength, Iafallo on the power play and Kempe shorthanded in the opening 7:35.Saad broke up the momentum briefly, but Arvidsson and Moore had power-play goals and Hofer’s night ended with 3:38 left in the opening period.Jordan Binnington made 12 saves in relief, stopping a penalty shot by Arvidsson midway through the second.Things got dicey for the Kings when the Blues scored three straight goals in the second period, pulling within one on Kyrou’s power-play goal with 2:25 left.“We were able to get to a young goaltender, and it came real fast,” Kings coach Todd McLellan said. “Nothing ever comes easy in this league, but the power play was clicking. Everything felt good, and then we played like it felt good instead of playing our game, and that’s when it changed.”Kempe responded with his 36th goal early in the third to push the margin back to two, and Doughty struck on the power play 39 seconds after Kapanen made it 6-5.“It’s all wrong today,"" Buchnevich said of the special teams breakdowns by the Blues. ""I think we’ve been last couple months super solid on PK. I don’t know, maybe their game, it doesn’t click.”Kyrou cut it to 7-6 with 49 seconds remaining and Binnington pulled for an extra attacker.WELCOME BACKThe Kings saw the returns of F Kevin Fiala (lower body) and D Sean Durzi (upper body) after recent absences, and both players made their presence felt on the power play. Los Angeles was 4 for 5 with the man-advantage, with Durzi producing two assists and Fiala collecting one of his two helpers on special teams.“The power play was clicking again, so that was big thanks to them two, and nice to have them back in the lineup.”NOTES: Arvidsson has five goals and two assists in his past three games. ... The Kings have scored at least four goals in one period in four of their last five games. ... Kings C Blake Lizotte served a one-game suspension after receiving a match penalty for cross-checking Winnipeg D Josh Morrissey on Saturday.UP NEXTBlues: Host the Vancouver Canucks on Tuesday night.Kings: Visit the Calgary Flames on Tuesday night.___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/27,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847800,Tokyo demands China free Japan national detained in Beijing,"TOKYO (AP) — Tokyo has demanded that China release a Japanese national who was detained in Beijing earlier this month on suspicion of spying, Japan’s top government spokesperson said Monday.Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno told a news conference that Japan's Embassy in China was informed by Chinese authorities that a Japanese man in his 50s was taken into custody in Beijing earlier in March.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said in Beijing that “the Japanese citizen is suspected of engaging in espionage activities in violation of the criminal law ... and the Anti-Espionage Law of the People’s Republic of China.”All foreigners who visit and live in China “must abide by Chinese laws, and those who break the law and commit crimes must be held accountable according to the law,” Mao said at a regular news briefing.He said that similar cases involving Japanese citizens have occurred repeatedly and urged the Japanese government to “strengthen education among its citizens and send them reminders.”In Tokyo, Matsuno said the Japanese government had demanded the early release of its citizen. Japan also requested that Chinese authorities allow the man access to Japanese consular officials. He said Japan's government is providing as much support for him as possible, including communicating with relevant parties.A Japanese pharmaceutical company, Astellas Pharma Inc., acknowledged that the man detained is its employee, but declined to disclose further details, including his name, position and whether he is based in China. The company said it was seeking information from the Japanese Foreign Ministry.More than a dozen Japanese citizens with business or other connections to China have been arrested in the past over allegations including spying. A Japanese diplomat was detained for questioning in 2022 and released hours later, prompting strong protests from Japan.Tokyo and Beijing have been increasingly at odds in recent years as Japan considers China's growing influence in the region as a threat to its national security and the economy.",2023/03/27,,World

Mississippi is one of the poorest states in the U.S., and the majority-Black Delta has long been one of the poorest parts of Mississippi — a place where many people work paycheck to paycheck in jobs tied to agriculture.Two of the counties walloped by the tornado, Sharkey and Humphreys, are among the most sparsely populated in the state, with only a few thousand residents in communities scattered across wide expanses of cotton, corn and soybean fields.Sharkey’s poverty rate is 35%, and Humphreys’ is 33%, compared to about 19% for Mississippi and under 12% for the entire United States.“It’s going to be a long road to recovery, trying to rebuild and get over the devastation,” Wayne Williams, who teaches construction skills at a vocational education center in Rolling Fork, said Sunday as people across town hammered blue tarps onto damaged roofs and used chainsaws to cut fallen trees.The tornado killed 25 and injured dozens in Mississippi. It destroyed many homes and businesses in Rolling Fork and the nearby town of Silver City, leaving mounds of lumber, bricks and twisted metal.The local housing stock was already tight, and some who lost their homes said they will live with friends of relatives. Mississippi opened more than a half-dozen shelters to temporarily house people displaced by the tornado.President Joe Biden issued an emergency declaration for Mississippi early Sunday, making federal funding available to hardest-hit areas.Berry spent the weekend with friends and family sorting through salvageable items at her destroyed home near a two-lane highway that traverses farm fields. She said she walked to the church before the tornado because her sister called her Friday night and frantically said TV weather forecasters had warned a potentially deadly storm was headed her way. Berry said as the storm rumbled and howled overhead, she tried to ignore the noise.“That’s the only thing that was stuck in my head was just to pray, pray and cry out to God,” she said Saturday. “I didn’t hear nothing but my own self praying and God answering my prayer. I mean, I can get another house, another furniture. But literally saving my life — I’m thankful.”Her sister, Dianna Berry, said her own home a few miles away was undamaged. She works at a deer camp, and she said her boss has offered to let Kimberly Berry and her daughters live there for as long as they need.",2023/03/27,104,World

Taken by 19 Japanese reporters, over 200 archived photos are on display, including Abe holding a pineapple to show support for Taiawn, or he comforted earthquake victims in Hualien city with his kind words.In November 2022, the show made its debut in Tokyo and is now touring Taiwan, which is its first overseas location. In the Taipei exhibition, Abe’s wife, Abe Akie, provided over 30 centerpieces that bring the statesman’s other side to light.At Monday's opening press event, President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文), Culture Minister Shih Che (史哲), and Vice Premier Cheng Wen-tsan (鄭文燦), were on hand. Tsai noted that the strong relationship between Japan and Taiwan is due to Abe, as he often emphasized the importance of stability in the Taiwan Strait to the world.""In the face of the international situation, the concept of a free and open Indo-Pacific, which was first brought up by Abe, has become a common strategic goal shared by international democratic allies,"" said Tsai.Japan’s chief representative in Taiwan, Izumi Hiroyasu (泉裕泰), noted that the exhibition taking place overseas in Taiwan is unprecedented. “This event shows how much Abe was loved in Taiwan. Also, it strengthens my determination to deepen exchanges between both sides,” said Izumi.The exhibition will run until April 10 at Chang Yung-fa (張榮發) International Convention Center.

Baboons can turn dangerous when provoked or cornered.The baboon is about 110 centimeters tall and weighs around 20 kilograms. It is also thought to have escaped from nearby Leofoo Village Theme Park, though the park denies missing any of its baboons.Taoyuan City Government said there were two baboon sightings yesterday, and one reported sighting on Monday morning around the Fugang area. More manpower was deployed to catch the baboon, as well as drones for aerial surveillance.Traps baited with fruit are being deployed to catch the baboon. (Borough Chief Chen Jin-fu photo)Taoyuan’s Agriculture Bureau is now trying to trap the baboon by placing fruit and vegetables in metal cages. Previously, municipal officials tried to hunt down and cage the baboon, which proved to be ineffective as the animal was too elusive. Whether stationary traps will be more effective still needs to be evaluated.Farmers were the first to tip off authorities that a baboon was in the Taoyuan area, with one reporting that lettuce from his garden had been pulled up and eaten, with a suspicious foot print left behind, per UDN.Fruit deployed to lure the baboon into a cage. (Taoyuan Bureau of Agriculture photo)Taoyuan’s Bureau of Agriculture said that multiple fruit baited traps will be effective as the baboon begins to become less suspicious as it spends more time outside. Still, many municipal officials are eager to successfully conclude the case and avoid panicking the public.",2023/03/27,4440,Environment

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847854,"In Macron's France, streets and fields seethe with protest","PARIS (AP) — A big day has come for French high school student Elisa Fares. At age 17, she is taking part in her first protest.In a country that taught the world about people power with its revolution of 1789 — and a country again seething with anger against its leaders — graduating from bystander to demonstrator is a generations-old rite of passage. Fares looks both excited and nervous as she prepares to march down Paris streets where people for centuries have similarly defied authority and declared: “Non!”Two friends, neither older than 18 but already protest veterans whose parents took them to demonstrations when they were little, are showing Fares the ropes. They’ve readied eyedrops and gas masks in case police fire tear gas — as they have done repeatedly in recent weeks.“The French are known for fighting and we'll fight,"" says one of the friends, Coline Marionneau, also 17. “My mother goes to a lot of demonstrations ... She says if you have things to say, you should protest.”For French President Emmanuel Macron, the look of determination on their young faces only heralds deepening crisis. His government has ignited a firestorm of anger with unpopular pension reforms that he railroaded through parliament and which, most notably, push the legal retirement age from 62 to 64.Furious not just with the prospect of working for longer but also with the way Macron imposed it, his opponents have switched to full-on disobedience mode. They're regularly striking and demonstrating and threatening to make his second and final term as president even more difficult than his first. It, too, was rocked by months of protests — often violent — by so-called yellow vest campaigners against social injustice.Fares, the first-time protester, said her mother had been against her taking to the streets but has now given her blessing.“She said that if I wanted to fight, she wouldn’t stop me,” the teen says.Critics accuse Macron of effectively ruling by decree, likening him to France’s kings of old. Their reign finished badly: In the French Revolution, King Louis XVI ended up on the guillotine. There’s no danger of that happening to Macron. But hobbled in parliament and contested on the streets piled high with reeking garbage uncollected by striking workers, he’s being given a tough lesson, again, about French people power. Freshly scrawled slogans in Paris reference 1789.So drastically has Macron lost the initiative that he was forced to indefinitely postpone a planned state visit this week by King Charles III. Germany, not France, will now get the honor of being the first overseas ally to host Charles as monarch.The France leg of Charles' tour would have coincided with a new round of strikes and demonstrations planned for Tuesday that are again likely to mobilize many hundreds of thousands of protesters. Macron said the royal visit likely would have become their target, which risked creating a “detestable situation.”Encouraged by that victory, the protest movement is plowing on and picking up new recruits, including some so young that it will be many decades before they'll be directly impacted by the pushed-back retirement age. Their involvement is a worrisome development for Macron, because it suggests that protests are evolving, broadening from workplace and retirement concerns to a more generalized malaise with the president and his governance.Violence is picking up, too. Police and environmental activists fought pitched battles over the weekend in rural western France, resulting in dozens of injuries. Officers fired more than 4,000 nonlethal dispersion grenades in fending off hundreds of protesters who rained down rocks, powerful fireworks and gasoline bombs on police lines.“Anger and resentment,” says former President François Hollande, Macron's predecessor, “are at a level that I have rarely seen.”For Fares, whose first demonstration was a peaceful protest in Paris this weekend, the final straw was Macron’s decision to not let legislators vote on his retirement reform, because he wasn’t sure of winning a majority for it. Instead, he ordered his prime minister to skirt parliament by using a special constitutional power to ram the bill through.It was the 11th time that Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne had to resort to the so-called Article 49.3 power in just 10 months — a telling sign of Macron’s fragility since he lost his parliamentary majority in an election last June.“It’s an attack on democracy,” Fares said. “It annoyed me too much.”Her friend Luna Dessommes, 18, added hopefully: “We have to use the movement to politicize more and more young people.”At age 76, veteran protester Gilbert Leblanc has been through it all before. He was a yellow vest; by his count, he took part in more than 220 of their protests in Macron's first term, rallying to the cry that the former banker was too pro-business and ""the president of the rich.""Long before that, Leblanc cut his teeth in seminal civil unrest that reshaped France in May 1968. He says that when he tells awe-struck young protesters that he was a “soixante-huitard” — a '68 veteran — they “want to take selfies with me.”This winter, he has kept his heating off, instead saving the money for train fares to the capital, so he can protest every weekend, he said.“My grandfather who fought in World War I, got the war medal. He would rise from his grave if he saw me sitting at home, in my sofa, not doing anything,” Leblanc said.“Everything we've obtained has been with our tears and blood.”",2023/03/27,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847855,"Deal to buy Silicon Valley Bank calms bank fears, for now","NEW YORK (AP) — First Citizens Bank is buying much of Silicon Valley Bank, the tech-focused financial institution whose failure this month set off a chain reaction that helped rattle faith in banks around the world.The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and other regulators had already taken extraordinary steps to head off a wider crisis by guaranteeing all depositors in SVB and another failed institution, Signature Bank, could get their money, even if they had more than the $250,000 limit insured by the FDIC.The First Citizens deal announced late Sunday, at least initially, seemed to achieve what regulators have sought: a shoring up of trust in other regional banks across the country.Stock prices strengthened for First Republic, PacWest Bancorp. and other banks that investors have spotlighted as most at risk for a sudden exodus of nervous customers, similar to the run that caused Silicon Valley Bank's failure.The sale underscores that Silicon Valley Bank’s assets do have value and helps to rebuild some faith in the banking sector, investors and experts said. But they also said it doesn’t by itself provide an immediate all-clear for other banks following the second- and third-largest U.S. failures in history. Restoring trust and figuring out exactly what pain other banks may ultimately feel will take more time.“The financial system is like a boat,” said Aaron Klein, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former official at the Treasury Department. “SVB’s collapse has rocked the boat, but the ship is righting itself.”“The news today is good, it’s a positive step forward to digging out of the hole of the collapse that SVB put us in,” he said. “But losses are substantial: $20 billion is real money, even in Washington.”That $20 billion is referring to the loss the FDIC says its deposit insurance fund could take because of Silicon Valley Bank's failure. As part of the deal with First Citizens, the FDIC agreed to share in potential losses or gains coming out of some of the loans purchased from Silicon Valley Bank.The $20 billion wouldn't come from taxpayers. It would instead come from an FDIC fund that banks pay into. But banks could ultimately charge slightly more in fees or pay less in interest to their customers to help make up for it, Klein said.“The question is who should bear those losses?"" he said. “Should seniors get a few less interest points on their bank deposits, or should” big depositors with more than $250,000 at Silicon Valley Bank be willing to lose some of their cash?First Citizens agreed to buy about $72 billion of Silicon Valley Bank's assets at a discount of $16.5 billion. About $90 billion in assets remain in FDIC's receivership. The FDIC also received rights related to First Citizen BancShares stock that could be worth up to $500 million.Since the banking crisis began in mid-March, officials from the Treasury Department to the Federal Reserve have said they still see the system as sound and secure.Todd Phillips, a fellow at the Roosevelt Institute and a former attorney at the FDIC, said extraordinary actions by regulators back up those statements. Besides guaranteeing deposits at Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, regulators also announced a program to allow other banks to raise cash more easily. That has the overall banking system on more stable footing in his mind, even if investors are sending some bank stocks on wild runs.“What D.C. is thinking and what New York is thinking about everything that’s going on is very different,” Phillips said. “New York appears to be very concerned that there are more banks that may fail and that shareholders will be wiped out, whereas D.C. is much more concerned about the health and safety of the financial system.”He said his general message to people is: “Your deposits will be fine. You will be fine. This really is a crisis of large institutional shareholders of banks that are worried” about losing their money.Phillips said the next big step will be to see if Congress does anything to broaden deposit protections for customers at banks.Amanda Agati, chief investment officer of PNC Asset Management Group, looks at the banking industry's struggles through the eyes of an investor, and she sees more pain coming. She just doesn't know exactly how much and from where.Interest rates have leaped over the last year as the Fed tries to get high inflation under control, and that's squeezing the system and causing weak links to crack. “It’s highlighting increased stress in the system,” she said, and it could lead banks to lend less, which would put more pressure on the economy.The Federal Reserve just raised interest rates again last week, and Agati said what it does going forward will likely have a greater impact on markets and the economy than which bank could be next to see its stock drop.As for the First Citizens-Silicon Valley Bank deal, she said: “I don’t think it moves the needle at all in terms of the market overall.""Silicon Valley Bank, based in Santa Clara, California, collapsed March 10 in a bank run after customers rushed to withdraw money due to fears over the bank’s solvency. It was the second-largest bank collapse in U.S. history after the 2008 failure of Washington Mutual. Two days later, New York’s Signature Bank was seized by regulators in the third-largest bank failure in the U.S.Customers of Silicon Valley Bank will automatically become customers of First Citizens, which is headquartered in Raleigh, North Carolina. The 17 former branches of SVB will open as First Citizens branches Monday, the FDIC said.New York Community Bank agreed to buy a significant chunk of Signature Bank in a $2.7 billion deal a week ago, but the search for a buyer for SVB took longer.First Citizens Bank, which was founded in 1898, saw its shares surge following the deal's announcement. They were up a little more than 55% in late-day trading.",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847856,Myanmar army leader calls for decisive action to crush foes,"BANGKOK (AP) — As Myanmar’s military put on an annual show of strength Monday, its top leader told its assembled ranks they need to take decisive action against those fighting army rule of the country.Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing spoke at a military parade on Armed Forces Day. At sunrise, members of all service branches marched in mass formations onto a huge parade ground in the capital, Naypyitaw, backed by armored vehicles, missiles and artillery as well as fighter jets and helicopters flying overhead.Myanmar’s military has been accused of indiscriminate killings of civilians as it engages in major offensives to suppress the armed resistance opposed to its takeover of the government two years ago. Min Aung Hlaing in his speech said those who condemned his military government demonstrated indifference to the violence committed by its opponents.Armed Forces Day marks the anniversary of the start of a 1945 uprising of a ragtag army against occupying Japanese forces. The country then called Burma attained independence from colonial power Britain in 1948 and has been ruled by a succession of military governments for most of the years since.On Feb. 1, 2021, the army ousted Aung San Suu Kyi’s elected government, prompting peaceful protests that security forces suppressed with bloody violence. The escalation of the violence since then has been characterized by U.N. experts and others as a civil war.The opposition to military rule is led by a self-styled National Unity Government, or NUG, which was established by elected lawmakers who were denied their seats by the army and stakes a claim to being the country’s legitimate administration.Its armed wing, the loosely organized People’s Defense Forces, or PDF, along with their armed ethnic minority allies, regularly strike military columns, bases and outposts. At the same time, the army and air force are hitting villages with artillery and air strikes, often causing civilian casualties and credibly being accused of other brutal human rights abuses. Their offenses have displaced more than a million people, causing a humanitarian crisis.“The terror acts of the NUG and its lackey so-called PDFs are needed to be tackled for good and all,"" Min Aung Hlaing said in his speech. ""The (military) and the government also need to take action against this terrorist group, trying to devastate the country and killing the people.”His government has declared major resistance organizations to be terrorist groups, and anyone associated with them is subject to harsh punishment.While Min Aung Hlaing said the actions of his military were necessary to achieve peace, his government is keen to dismiss allegations of human rights abuses by pointing at violence carried out by its opponents.After security forces arrested, tortured and killed activists in the cities, urban guerrilla groups responded with bombing and assassinations of targets linked to the military. On Friday, a veteran corporate lawyer accused of being a military crony was shot dead in the country's biggest city, Yangon.There were scattered protests reported against the army's celebration.Independent online media reported that bomb explosions took place in at least three areas of the country’s biggest city, Yangon on Monday morning.Yangon Revolution Force, a pro-democracy activist group, announced it had protested Armed Forces Day by performing a ritual at a Buddhist pagoda placing a curse on Min Aung Hlaing. The military’s leaders, like many other people in Myanmar, are known to be highly superstitious.In the Sagaing region in the northwest, a stronghold of armed resistance, people held small protests against Armed Forces Day.___Find more AP Asia-Pacific coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific",2023/03/27,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847857,Taiwan's former leader Ma begins China visit,"TAOYUAN, Taiwan (AP) — Former Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou departed for a tour of China on Monday, in what he called an attempt to reduce tensions a day after Taiwan lost one of its few remaining diplomatic partners to China.The ex-president is visiting in a private capacity, bringing a delegation of academics and college students for exchanges, as well as members of his family, but the trip is loaded with political meaning.Ma’s policies brought Taiwan and Beijing to their closest relationship ever, but his exit from office was overshadowed by massive protests against a trade deal with the mainland and his successor has focused on bolstering ties with the U.S. and defending the autonomy of the democratically governed island that China claims as part of its own territory.Current President Tsai Ing-wen is expected to launch a 10-day diplomatic tour of her own Wednesday, ostensibly to visit the island's remaining allies in Latin America. She will stop in the U.S., Taiwan’s biggest unofficial partner and supplier of arms.Ma's visit comes amid rising tensions. Beijing has stepped up pressure against Taiwan in recent years, poaching its diplomatic allies while also sending military fighter jets flying towards the island on a near daily basis. On Sunday, Honduras established diplomatic relations with China, leaving Taiwan with only 13 countries that recognize it as a sovereign state.Ma, a member of the opposition Nationalist Party (Kuomingtang), will land in Shanghai before starting his visit in nearby Nanjing. He is expected to tour the mainland from March 27 to April 7, stopping in Wuhan and Changsha, as well as other cities. He is bringing college students from Taiwan to meet with fellow students from Shanghai’s Fudan University and Changsha’s Hunan University.Ma has framed the visit as a bid to lower the tensions in cross-strait relations through people to people exchange. “I hope through the enthusiasm of the youth and their interactions to improve the cross-strait mood, so bring peace faster, and earlier,” he said to reporters ahead of his departure on Monday afternoon. He said it would be his first time to visit China.His trip has not drawn much controversy in Taiwan, where the public is used to seeing Kuomingtang politicians visit China. However, it has been criticized by some political opponents and activists.A former mainland student leader in the 1989 Tiananmen square protests called on Ma to cancel his trip. “If you have even a strand of affection for Taiwan ... you should announce the cancellation of your trip,” said Wang Dan, a Chinese dissident who previously lived in Taiwan, on his Facebook page.A handful of protesters from a pro-independence group held a demonstration at the departures area at Taoyuan airport before Ma's departure. “Ma Ying-jeou is humiliating our nation and forfeiting its sovereignty,"" they shouted before police carried them out. “You are a stinky beggar.”On the other side, a small group of people from the pro-unification camp also came to the airport to show their support. “Cross-strait relations are like flowers blossoming in spring and both sides are a family,"" they shouted.The trip is also a chance for him to honor his ancestors, ahead of Tomb Sweeping Day on April 5. During the festival, which is celebrated in Taiwan and China among other countries, families visit ancestral graves to maintain the burial grounds and remember the dead.Ma will not go to Beijing, but may meet with Chinese officials.Ma met with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Singapore in 2015, while he was still in office. The meeting was the first between the leaders of the two sides since Taiwan split from mainland China in 1949 during the Chinese civil war, but was considered more symbolic than substantive.In 2016, the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party won national elections and Beijing cut off contact with Taiwan’s government, citing Tsai's refusal to endorse the idea that Taiwan and China are one country.___Wu reported from Taipei.",2023/03/27,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847858,A steel plant ready for war shows hit to Ukraine's economy,"ZAPORIZHZHIA, Ukraine (AP) — Flak jackets are piled up at Ukraine’s Zaporizhstal steel plant, and anti-tank traps guard the entrance. Whenever air raid sirens sound — and they go off every day — most workers head to one of the 16 bomb shelters scattered across the sprawling grounds.But some keep working — braving not only the intense heat and sparks flying from blast furnaces forging steel used in everything from railway cars to household appliances, but the threat of shelling — to keep the molten metal moving.The southwestern city of Zaporizhzhia, which gives the plant its name, is less than 50 kilometers (31 miles) from the front line and its residential buildings and energy infrastructure are a frequent Russian target. The impact of the war has left the plant running below full capacity, with a third of its 10,000 workers idle.The damage to Ukraine’s metal industry has crippled a lucrative sector and key employer needed to support an economy cratered by war. Efforts to restore production and get goods moving again to customers worldwide will be crucial to helping the country rebuild.A pillar of the economy before the war, the metal industry accounted for a third of the goods that Ukraine exported, but it has been upended by Russian forces who have taken control of the industrial heartland — the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.For steel and mining company Metinvest, the slowdowns at the Zaporizhstal steel plant are only part of the pain. Since Russia seized Ukraine's Crimea Peninsula in 2014, the company has lost equipment and facilities in Russian-controlled areas, seen workers head to the front line and lacked enough security to grow.But “the biggest damage we have suffered is the damage caused to the economy of Ukraine,” Metinvest CEO Yurii Ryzhenkov told The Associated Press. “When damage is done to the country, the company suffers from it no less than from direct hits of shells.”At the Zaporizhstal steel plant, life still revolves around the blast furnaces, even if only three out of four are operating. Relentless hissing fills the air, which is tinged with the pungent, acidic tang of sulfur that results from separating cast iron and waste deposits.The workers' silver suits reflect the blinding light emanating from the red, molten metal churning in the blast furnace, where temperatures reach 1,500 C (more than 2,700 F).The process looks busy, but the workers know they are melting less cast iron than before the war.“We are limited. Both in terms of raw materials and sales,” said Oleh Ilin, the blast furnace master.Unlike other industrial enterprises in Ukraine, Zaporizhstal wasn’t damaged by artillery fire or missile strikes. But like many others, its growth has been hindered by power outages from Russian missile attacks, damage to infrastructure and blocked Black Sea ports.The latter is one of the biggest challenges for Zaporizhstal, where work has been interrupted only twice in its almost 90-year history — during World War II and shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine. Russian troops were stopped just dozens of kilometers from the plant last spring, but almost a year later, it hasn't been able to recover fully.Prices are higher for products that Zaporizhstal makes, and they are harder to get to customers. Trains instead of ships mostly move orders, increasing prices not just for transportation but for production and raw materials.Before the war, Zaporizhstal could complete a batch of steel strips used in appliances like refrigerators, for example, and deliver it in a month or two, said Roman Slobodianiuk, general director of Zaporizhstal. Now, it could take three months or longer.“Not every client is ready to take such risks. So we were forced to reduce the geography of our customers,” he said.Zaporizhstal used to work with customers in almost 60 countries — that has been reduced by half. The war affected its capacity to fulfill orders in much of the Middle East and many African countries.“Before the war, around 90% of metallurgical products were exported through the sea, because it was much cheaper,” said Dmytro Goriunov from Ukraine’s Center for Economic Strategy.Now, the plant focuses on closer European countries and the U.S. market, which can be reached through Polish seaports.About a third of the metal industry’s capacity has been destroyed and production is about 65% lower, according to data from industry association Ukrmetallurgprom and Oxford Economics.The KSE Institute of Ukraine estimated that damage to Ukrainian businesses as a whole from the war amounts to $13 billion. Economic output shrank by about a third in 2022, and the economy ministry forecasts growth of only 1% this year.The government relies on donations from allies like the European Union and the U.S. to pay citizens' wages and pensions, helping it avoid printing money that could fuel inflation. Ukraine got a boost last week with a $15.6 billion loan package from the International Monetary Fund.For its part, Metinvest is trying to rebuild after losing two major facilities to Russia, including the Azovstal steel plant where Ukrainians fought off a siege from its labyrinth of tunnels and bunkers in Mariupol.Maksym Notchenko, 41, a former worker of Azovstal, watched from a distance as the plant was besieged with Russian strikes: “It was like pieces of your body were being cut off.”He fled and started working at Zaporizhstal last April. About 20,000 other Metinvest workers did the same, leaving occupied territories or front-line fighting. Before the invasion, Metinvest had around 100,000 workers — now the number is 85,000.Ryzhenkov, the CEO, said that restoring supply chains, primarily unblocking Black Sea ports, will revive the company.“A trait of Ukrainians, that despite everything that happens to us, we continue to work, we invent new ways of working, how to be effective in any situation,” Ryzhenkov said.He says the only way to guarantee Metinvest's security and development is liberating all Russian-held territories, including Crimea. That's why the company invests resources to support Ukrainian forces.Their “victory can guarantee Ukraine and the business that it can develop here,” Ryzhenkov said.___AP Business Writer David McHugh contributed to this report from Frankfurt, Germany.___Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine: https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine.",2023/03/27,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847859,Deputies accused of shoving guns in mouths of 2 Black men,"BRANDON, Miss. (AP) — Several deputies from a Mississippi sheriff’s department being investigated by the Justice Department for possible civil rights violations have been involved in at least four violent encounters with Black men since 2019 that left two dead and another with lasting injuries, an Associated Press investigation found.Two of the men allege that Rankin County sheriff's deputies shoved guns into their mouths during separate encounters. In one case, the deputy pulled the trigger, leaving the man with wounds that required parts of his tongue to be sewn back together. In one of the two fatal confrontations, the man's mother said a deputy kneeled on her son's neck while he told them he couldn't breathe.Police and court records obtained by the AP show that several deputies who were accepted to the sheriff's office's Special Response Team — a tactical unit whose members receive advanced training — were involved in each of the four encounters. In three of them, the heavily redacted documents don't indicate if they were serving in their normal capacity as deputies or as members of the unit.Such units have drawn scrutiny since the January killing of Tyre Nichols, a Black father who died days after being severely beaten by Black members of a special police team in Memphis, Tennessee. Nichols' death led to a Justice Department probe of similar squads around the country that comes amid the broader public reckoning over race and policing sparked by the 2020 police murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis.In Mississippi, the police shooting of Michael Corey Jenkins led the Justice Department to open a civil rights investigation into the Rankin County Sheriff’s Department. Jenkins said six white deputies burst into a home where he was visiting a friend, and one put a gun in his mouth and fired. Jenkins’ hospital records, parts of which he shared with AP, show he had a lacerated tongue and broken jaw.Deputies said Jenkins was shot after he pointed a gun at them; department officials have not answered multiple inquiries from the AP asking whether a weapon was found at the scene. Jenkins’ attorney, Malik Shabazz, said his client didn’t have a gun.“They had complete control of him the entire time. Six officers had full and complete control of Michael the entire time,” Shabazz said. “So that’s just a fabrication.”Rankin County, which has about 120 sheriff's deputies serving its roughly 160,000 people, is predominantly white and just east of the state capital, Jackson, home to one of the highest percentages of Black residents of any major U.S. city. In the county seat of Brandon, a towering granite-and-marble monument topped by a statue of a Confederate soldier stands across the street from the sheriff's office.In a notice of an upcoming lawsuit, attorneys for Jenkins and his friend Eddie Terrell Parker said on the night of Jan. 24 the deputies suddenly came into the home and proceeded to handcuff and beat them. They said the deputies stunned them with Tasers repeatedly over roughly 90 minutes and, at one point, forced them to lie on their backs as the deputies poured milk over their faces. The men restated the allegations in separate interviews with the AP.When a Taser is used, it’s automatically logged into the device’s memory. The AP obtained the automated Taser records from the evening of Jan. 24. They show that deputies first fired one of the stun guns at 10:04 p.m. and fired one at least three more times over the next 65 minutes. However, those unredacted records might not paint a complete picture, as redacted records show that Tasers were turned on, turned off or used dozens more times during that period.The Mississippi Bureau of Investigation was brought in to investigate the encounter. Its summary says a deputy shot Jenkins at approximately 11:45 p.m., or about 90 minutes after a Taser was first used, which matches the timeframe given by Parker and Jenkins. The deputy’s name was not disclosed by the bureau.Police say the raid was prompted by a report of drug activity at the home. Jenkins was charged with possessing between 2 and 10 grams of methamphetamine and aggravated assault on a police officer. Parker was charged with two misdemeanors — possession of paraphernalia and disorderly conduct. Jenkins and Parker say the raid came to a head when the deputy shot Jenkins through the mouth. He still has difficulty speaking and eating.Another Black man, Carvis Johnson, alleged in a federal lawsuit filed in 2020 that a Rankin County deputy placed a gun into his mouth during a 2019 drug bust. Johnson was not shot.There is no reason for an officer to place a gun in a suspect’s mouth, and to have allegations of two such incidents is telling, said Samuel Walker, emeritus professor of criminal justice at the University of Nebraska.“If there are incidents with the same kind of pattern of behavior, they have their own set of rules,” he said. “So these are not just chance experiences. It looks like a very clear pattern.”Jenkins doesn't know the name of the deputy who shot him. In the heavily redacted incident report, an unidentified deputy wrote, “I noticed a gun.” The unredacted sections don't say who shot Jenkins, only that he was taken to a hospital. Deputy Hunter Elward swore in a separate court document that Jenkins pointed the gun at him.Elward's name also appears in police reports and court records from the two incidents in which suspects were killed.The sheriff's department refused repeated interview requests and denied access to any of the deputies who were involved in the violent confrontations. The department has not said whether deputies presented a search warrant, and it's unclear if any have been disciplined or are still members of the special unit.The news outlet Insider has been investigating the sheriff’s department and persuaded a county judge to order the sheriff to turn over documents related to the deaths of four men in 2021. Chancery Judge Troy Farrell Odom expressed bewilderment that the department had refused to make the documents public.“(The) day that our law enforcement officers start shielding this information from the public, all the while repeating, ‘Trust us. We’re from the government,’ is the day that should startle all Americans,” Odom wrote.The AP requested body camera or dashcam footage from the night of the Jenkins raid. Jason Dare, an attorney for the sheriff’s department, said there was no record of either.Mississippi doesn’t require police officers to wear body cameras. Incident reports and court records tie deputies from the raid to three other violent encounters with Black men.During a 2019 standoff, Elward said Pierre Woods pointed a gun at him while running at deputies. Deputies then shot and killed him. In a statement to the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation obtained by the AP, Elward said he fired at Woods eight times. Police say they recovered a handgun at the scene of the Woods shooting.Court records place Christian Dedmon, another deputy who shot at Woods, at the Jenkins raid.Dedmon was also among deputies involved in a 2019 arrest of Johnson, according to the lawsuit Johnson filed alleging that one of the deputies put a gun in his mouth as they searched him for drugs. Johnson is currently imprisoned for selling methamphetamine.Other documents obtained by the AP detail another violent confrontation between Elward and Damien Cameron, a 29-year-old man with a history of mental illness. He died in July 2021 after being arrested by Elward and Deputy Luke Stickman, who also opened fire on Woods during the 2019 standoff. A grand jury declined to bring charges in the case last October.In an incident report, Elward wrote that while responding to a vandalism call, he repeatedly shocked Cameron with a Taser, punched and grappled with Cameron at the home of his mother, Monica Lee. He said after getting Cameron to his squad car, he again stunned him to get him to pull his legs into the vehicle.After going back inside to retrieve his Taser, deputies returned to find Cameron unresponsive. Elward wrote that he pulled Cameron from the car and performed CPR, but Cameron was later declared dead at a hospital.Lee, who witnessed the confrontation, told the AP that after subduing her son, Elward kneeled on his back for several minutes. She said when Stickman arrived, he kneeled on her son’s neck while handcuffing him, and that her son complained he couldn't breathe.Lee said she later went outside, hoping to talk to her son before the deputies drove him away.“I walked outside to tell him goodbye and that I loved him, and that I would try to see him the next day. That’s when I noticed they were on the driver’s side of the car doing CPR on him,” Lee said. “I fell to the ground screaming and hollering.”___Michael Goldberg is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

Two members of the team proactively offered help and self-assigned tasks to aid her in crossing the street.At 9:37 a.m., the Facebook page for the team uploaded a video of the Good Samaritan act from a smartphone. The author of the post praised the two players for having warm hearts.The author wrote that although children can sometimes be rambunctious and naughty, they are always reminded to maintain a positive mindset and attitude. The author then thanked the two boys for their kindness.The post pointed out that their actions on Thursday were ""really worthy of appreciation and encouragement. The writer expressed the hope that the boys will continue to maintain a positive attitude and continue to work hard.A woman was cited by UDN as stating that her mother was moved by the boys' act of kindness and used her cell phone to capture the moment. She stated that her mother saw the boys first push the elderly woman's cart across the other side of the road before one of the boys went back to the other side and helped her cross the street.On Monday, the boys were identified by Liberty Times as Su Ya-ko (蘇亞各) and Chang Kei-hung (張科閎), both of whom are in 6th grade. According to the newspaper, it was Su who helped push the cart to the other side of the street, while Chang took the elderly woman's hand and helped her walk across the roadway.They said that when they first offered to help the woman, she initially declined. However, they persisted, and she agreed to have them first push her cart to the other side of the street before helping her cross.Su stated that when he pushed the cart across the street, many of the woman's recyclables fell onto the pavement, and he had to pick them up as he pushed forward. Chang said that a road that takes two or three seconds to cross in this case took over 30 seconds, but said it was worth it because he had a ""very warm feeling"" after helping the woman.Reflecting on the experience, the boys said that they were really happy to be able to help out. The video has garnered 122,000 views, 7,000 likes, and 222 comments.(Facebook, Taichung City Shangfeng Elementary School Baseball Team screenshot)",2023/03/27,1068,Society
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847887,Former Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou leaves for China,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Former Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou (馬英九) met briefly with local media before departing for China today to pay respects to his ancestors.
Ma said that he had waited 36 years before making this visit to China. He is leading an entourage of 30 Taiwanese college students affiliated with his foundation on the trip to foster greater cross-strait youth exchange, per UDN.
With Ma’s trip coming one day after Taiwan severed diplomatic relations with Honduras, many are urging Ma to be cautious on his 12-day trip to China.
Premier Chen Chien-jen (陳建仁), attending a ground-breaking ceremony at the Pingtung Science and Technology Industrial Park today (March 27), urged Ma to ""be less temperamental, and more courageous,” when it comes to diplomacy.










He also encouraged Ma to visit more countries and do more in support of Taiwan diplomats who are working hard to open more doors to overcome international isolation, per Liberty Times.
As Ma begins his trip today, more details are beginning to emerge regarding the genesis of the excursion, which started with Ma’s foundation notifying teachers and students that an overseas trip was being planned for the Tomb Sweeping Festival.
The destination was kept a secret until March 19, the day before the news of the China trip was made public, 30 students affiliated with Ma’s foundation were selected for an all-expense paid trip, sponsored by the Ma Ying-jeou Foundation.
In recent years, the COVID-19 pandemic froze cross-strait official links to event NGO interaction being delayed. This led many Taiwanese college students to have almost no interaction with Chinese students.
As Ma leads students to visit five different cities on a busy itinerary, he is hoping to reignite cross-strait interactions.TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Former Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou (馬英九) met briefly with local media before departing for China today to pay respects to his ancestors.Ma said that he had waited 36 years before making this visit to China.

Furthermore, the high-income class is also getting exposed to a wider range of bottled water, such as sparkling water and flavored water, which in turn boosts the sales of bottled water.China Bottled Water Market – By Product TypeBased on product types, the China bottled water market is segmented into spring water, purified water, mineral water, distilled water, sparkling water, and others. Because of the high health concerns, the mineral water segment dominates the China bottled water market with around 91% share. There are several health benefits of mineral water. For example, it reduces blood pressure, helps regulate blood circulation, controls cholesterol levels, and is a good source of essential minerals, such as magnesium. However, sparkling water is also growing rapidly due to consumers’ preference for sparkling water over sodas and other sugary carbonated beverages.Impact of COVID-19 on China Bottled Water MarketThe sudden COVID-19 outbreak negatively impacted the China bottled water market. Since the virus was thought to have originated from Wuhan, there was a high rate of COVID-19 infections and an overburdened healthcare system.

Consequently, the production and distribution operations of bottled water were directly impacted, resulting in shortages of stock in convenience stores and supermarkets/hypermarkets. Furthermore, the physical distribution of products also emerged as a challenge due to the risk of the virus spreading through solid surfaces. However, the online sales of bottled water witnessed significant growth during this period, especially among health-conscious consumers.China Bottled Water Market – Competitive LandscapeThe leading players in the China bottled water market are Nongfu Spring, FineWaters, Natural Waters of Viti Ltd., The Coca-Cola Company, Nestl Waters, China Resources (Holdings) Co.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847911,"India Bottled Water Market Overview, Demand, Supply and Production Status 2023 To 2031","The India bottled water market is on a steady growth path and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 6.4% during the forecast period of 2021-2027. The increase in pollution levels and the decreasing accessibility to safe drinking water are some of the factors driving the growth of the market. India has been experiencing water scarcity and pollution issues, and the situation is expected to worsen in the coming years. A report by UNICEF suggests that more than half of the Indian population does not have access to clean drinking water, and by 2030, around 40% of the Indian population may completely lose their access to drinking water. This has created significant growth opportunities for the India bottled water market.The flourishing tourism sector in India is also contributing to the growth of the market. Tourists are increasingly opting for bottled water as they consider it safer and more hygienic than tap water. This trend is expected to continue in the forecast period, providing an impetus for the growth of the India bottled water market.Download Free Sample of This Strategic Report: https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=MR385However, the growth of the India bottled water market may be hindered by counterfeit products of famous brands and strict government regulations on plastic bottles. The sale of counterfeit bottled water products may negatively impact the market growth, as consumers may switch to other safer alternatives. Moreover, government regulations on plastic bottles may restrict the usage of plastic bottles, impacting the bottled water market’s growth.In conclusion, the India bottled water market is growing at a fast pace and is expected to continue on a steady growth path during the forecast period. The increasing pollution levels, decreasing accessibility to safe drinking water, and flourishing tourism sector are the primary drivers of the market. However, counterfeit products of famous brands and strict government regulations on plastic bottles may hinder the market’s growth.Increasing Water Pollution Levels Propelling the Demand for Bottled Water in IndiaThe level of water pollution in India is very high, with around 80% of the water severely polluted. A large quantity of untreated sewage is released into water bodies, which is considered the primary cause of water pollution. Among 122 countries, India ranks 120th in terms of water quality. Water pollution in India is also caused by rapid industrialization and the discharge of industrial water into water bodies. The increasing water pollution levels are limiting people’s access to clean and safe drinking water, which is anticipated to boost the demand for bottled water during the forecast period.Flourishing Tourism in the Country is Boosting the India Bottled Water MarketTourism is one of the most flourishing sectors in India and acts as a crucial component in boosting the countrys economy. According to an estimate, over 10.93 million foreign tourists arrived in India in 2019. With the expanding tourism sector in India, the demand for bottled water is expected to surge as bottled water is the most reliable source for water consumption for tourists. Additionally, the growth in the hospitality sector is fueling the demand for bottled water in airports, railways, hotels and restaurants.India Bottled Water Market – By Distribution ChannelBased on distribution channels, the India bottled water market is categorized into on-trade and off-trade segments. The off-trade segment is further classified into supermarkets/hypermarkets, convenience stores, retail stores, specialty stores, online channels, home, and office delivery, and others. Among these, the retail store segment accounts for the largest market share because of the high number of retail stores in every locality in India and the easy availability of bottled water of various brands through these channels. On the other hand, the on-trade segment also covers a substantial share of the market. Many bottled water brands, such as Bisleri or Clear Pani, have formed partnerships with offices, restaurants, etc., as their official suppliers for packaged drinking water, which further propels this segment’s growth.Request To Download Sample of This Strategic Report:- https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=MR385India Bottled Water Market – Regional InsightsGeographically, the India bottled water market is segmented into North India, South India, East India, and West India. Among these regions, the southern part of India accounts for the largest market share. The severe water crisis in this part of the country is estimated to drive the demand for packaged drinking water during the forecast period. Additionally, the Western region also covers a substantial share of the market. The west is also faced with a similar situation as the south. The lack of access to safe and clean drinking water is expected to drive the bottled water market in South India.Impact of COVID-19 on India Bottled Water MarketThe sudden outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in India significantly halted the growth of the bottled water market. Nevertheless, the pandemic situation is expected to positively impact the market post-COVID-19 as consumers have now started purchasing bottled water directly from companies. According to reports, the COVID-19 situation disrupted access to water resources for a high percentage of the population. The lack of access to clean and safe water in India prompted its population to demand packaged drinking water, which will fuel the market growth in the forecast period.Additionally, most bottled water companies are partnering with the OwO micro delivery app for delivering water to residential areas in India. The app is said to handle over 500 orders per day in Gurugram (Haryana), including those for Bailley, Bisleri, Aquafina, Kinley of Coca-Cola, and Divya Jal of Patanjali. The company plans to expand to other areas in Delhi-NCR soon.India Bottled Water Market – Competitive LandscapeThe leading players in the India bottled water market are Parle, Coca-Cola India, PepsiCo, Tata Waters, Kingfisher Water, Narang Group, Energy Beverages Pvt. Ltd., Manikchand Groups, Rail Neer (Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation), A.V Organics LLP, Patanjali, and other prominent players.Request To Download Sample of This Strategic Report:- https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=MR385Market Segment:The market is highly concentrated among leading players such as Parle and Coca Cola.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847927,Figure skaters fleeing Russia as Ukraine war rages on,"Russian figure skating has confronted the repercussions of the International Skating Union's (ISU) ban on the participation of its skaters in international competitions.Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine began last year, dozens of talented youngsters have given up their citizenship to compete for other countries, even those on Russia's so-called 'Unfriendly countries' list.They are faced with harsh criticism not only from State Duma representatives but often from teammates in their new federations too.As figure skating fans follow the world championship that started in Tokyo on March 22, Russia's four-time Olympic champion Evgeni Plushenko's statement made last month has created a sporting and political scandal.After a junior championship in Perm, Pluschenko gave an interview in which he accused the judges for giving unfair scores to the students of his figure skating academy ""Angels of Plushenko"".""I talked to the parents of the athletes. Most likely there will be transfers to different countries"", Plushenko said. He added that many athletes who were judged unfairly may be affected. ""If our federation doesn't need my athletes, if our figure skating doesn't need them, then we will go where we are needed.""Among those who may switch allegiance is one of Plushenko's students, Veronika Zhilina (main picture). She received plaudits for being able to easily do quadruple jumps at the age of 14, as well as Zhilina's peer Sofia Titova, who can land the triple axel jump.Plushenko and his school did not respond to DW's interview inquiries.In Russia, the renowned coach's words were put into context and were seen as an attempt to remove his athletes from under the sanctions. ""Considering today's political situation… this sounds like treason,"" star choreographer Alexey Zheleznyakov said, in response to Zhilina and Titova's intentions.Despite such comments, last September, six months after the full-scale invasion, Russia's Figure Skating Federation announced that 19 athletes applied to switch federations. Given that this doesn't include those who don't belong to the federation, the real number of athletes who left or are planning to flee is even higher.The war against Ukraine and ensuing sanctions on Russian sports might have played a significant role in skaters' decision to give up their citizenship.""Athletes are young people of conscription age. Would they benefit from getting to the front in the assault units near Ugledar or straight to the next world? I don't think so,"" famous Russian Olympic sportscaster Kirill Nabutov said.""Do athletes profit from moping around their local rinks in St Petersburg, Moscow or Novosibirsk realizing how short their sporting life is without having a chance to take part in international competitions? The answer is no,"" he added.Most athletes themselves don't admit they have escaped Russia because of the war. The departure of 17-year-old Marya Dmitrieva, who can land a triple axel, caused a stir in the sports press last August.The teenager holds dual Russian-Israeli citizenship but only decided to move to Israel with her mother last year. In an interview with DW, she insists that it was her family's love for the Middle Eastern country and not sanctions against Russia that motivated them to move.Now Dmitrieva has been actively participating in competitions across the world that are unavailable to skaters from Russia. On her Instagram, she is posting joint photos with young skaters from different countries including ones from Ukraine. ""I meet Russian-speaking guys from various countries. Whatever countries we are from, we are all very friendly,"" Dmitrieva says.Dmitrieva explains that she was welcomed warmly by her teammates and is on good terms with the head of the Israeli Figure Skating Federation, Boris Chait. In this respect, she was luckier than her former teammate and friend, Polina Dhzumaniyazova,who transferred to the Hungarian team last year.When Polina joined the Hungarian national team it sparked harsh criticism from young Hungarian skater Vivien Papp. ""I had excellent results, but then a Russian girl was brought here. I will go to a place where I am welcomed and appreciated. My beautiful country does not need me,"" local media cited Papp. At the last European Figure Skating Championship, the Hungarian team consisted of 6 people, four of whom are Russian.Back in Russia, the athletes' relocations has been met with mixed reactions. ""Is it normal to change your sports citizenship in this situation? From my perspective, it is. It is not a betrayal at all,"" according to reknowned Russian coach Tatyana Tarasova, speaking shortly after the breakout of the war.However, some Russian politicians see it differently. Switching citizenships by athletes can only be considered as an act of high treason, State Duma representative and former Moscow regional sports minister Roman Tereshkov stated last summer. And though Tereshkov's words weren't backed by the Kremlin, this narrative has been repeated even by some coaches.""These words don't hurt me. If I have relatives in Israel, if I am Jewish, then why I can't compete for my second country?"" Dmitrieva said in reaction. She has set a goal to win the Junior World Championships and Olympic games in the next year, but it remains unclear whether her Russian compatriots will be allowed to take part in these competitions.",2023/03/24,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847936,"Amid strained US ties, China finds unlikely friend in Utah","SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — China’s global campaign to win friends and influence policy has blossomed in a surprising place: Utah, a deeply religious and conservative state with few obvious ties to the world’s most powerful communist country.An investigation by The Associated Press has found that China and its U.S.-based advocates spent years building relationships with the state’s officials and lawmakers. Those efforts have paid dividends at home and abroad, the AP found: Lawmakers delayed legislation Beijing didn’t like, nixed resolutions that conveyed displeasure with its actions and expressed support in ways that enhanced the Chinese government’s image.Its work in Utah is emblematic of a broader effort by Beijing to secure allies at the local level as its relations with the U.S. and its Western allies have turned acrimonious. U.S. officials say local leaders are at risk of being manipulated by China and have deemed the influence campaign a threat to national security.Beijing’s success in Utah shows “how pervasive and persistent China has been in trying to influence America,” said Frank Montoya Jr., a retired FBI counterintelligence agent who lives in Utah.“Utah is an important foothold,” he said. “If the Chinese can succeed in Salt Lake City, they can also make it in New York and elsewhere.”Security experts say that China’s campaign is widespread and tailored to local communities. In Utah, the AP found, Beijing and pro-China advocates appealed to lawmakers’ affiliations with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, better known as the Mormon church, which is the state’s dominant religion and one that has long dreamed of expanding in China.Beijing’s campaign in Utah has raised concerns among state and federal lawmakers and drawn the attention of the Justice Department.A state legislator told the AP he was interviewed by the FBI after introducing a resolution in 2020 expressing solidarity with China early in the coronavirus pandemic. A Utah professor who has advocated for closer ties between Washington and Beijing told the AP he’s been questioned by the FBI twice. The FBI declined to comment.'DECEPTIVE AND COERCIVE'Beijing’s interest in locally focused influence campaigns is not a secret. China’s leader, Xi Jinping, said during a trip to the U.S. in 2015 that “without successful cooperation at the sub-national level it would be very difficult to achieve practical results for cooperation at the national level.”A spokesman for the Chinese embassy in Washington told the AP that China “values its relationship with Utah” and any “words and deeds that stigmatize and smear these sub-national exchanges are driven by ulterior political purposes.”It is not unusual for countries, including the U.S., to engage in local diplomacy. U.S. officials and security experts have stressed that many Chinese language and cultural exchanges have no hidden agendas. However, they said, few nations have so aggressively courted local leaders in ways that raise national security concerns.In its annual threat assessment released earlier this month, the U.S. intelligence community reported that China is “redoubling” its local influence campaigns in the face of stiffening resistance at the national level. Beijing believes, the report said, that “local officials are more pliable than their federal counterparts.”The National Counterintelligence and Security Center in July warned state and local officials about “deceptive and coercive” Chinese influence operations. And FBI Director Christopher Wray last year accused China of seeking to “cultivate talent early—often state and local officials—to ensure that politicians at all levels of government will be ready to take a call and advocate on behalf of Beijing’s agenda.”Authorities in other countries, including Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom, have sounded similar alarms.Those concerns have arisen amid escalating disputes between the U.S. and China over trade, human rights, the future of Taiwan and China’s tacit support for Russia during its invasion of Ukraine. Tensions worsened last month when a suspected Chinese spy balloon was discovered and shot down in U.S. airspace.LEGISLATIVE AND PR VICTORIESU.S. officials have provided scant details about which states and localities the Chinese government has targeted. The AP focused its investigation on Utah because China appears to have cultivated a significant number of allies in the state and its advocates are well-known to lawmakers.Relying on dozens of interviews with key players and the review of hundreds of pages of records, text messages and emails obtained through public records’ requests, the AP found China won frequent legislative and public relations victories in Utah.China-friendly lawmakers, for example, delayed action for a year to ban Chinese-funded Confucius Institutes at state universities, according to the legislation’s sponsor. The Chinese language and cultural programs have been described by U.S. national security officials as propaganda instruments. The University of Utah and Southern Utah University closed their institutes by last year.In 2020, China scored an image-boosting coup when Xi sent a note to a class of Utah fourth-graders thanking them for cards they’d sent wishing him a happy Chinese New Year. He encouraged them to “become young ‘ambassadors’ for Sino-American friendship.”Emails obtained by the AP show the Chinese Embassy and the students’ Chinese teacher coordinated the letter exchange, which resulted in heavy coverage by state-controlled media in China.A Chinese state media outlet reported the Utah students jubilantly exclaimed: “Grandpa Xi really wrote back to me. He’s so cool!” Portraying China’s most authoritarian leader in decades as a kindly grandfather is a familiar trope in Chinese propaganda.Xi's letter garnered positive attention in Utah, too. A Republican legislator said on the state Senate floor that he “couldn’t help but think how amazing it was” that the Chinese leader took the time to write such a “remarkable” letter. Another GOP senator gushed on his conservative radio show that Xi’s letter “was so kind and so personal.”Dakota Cary, a China expert at the security firm Krebs Stamos Group, said in making such comments Utah lawmakers are “essentially acting as mouthpieces for the Chinese Communist Party” and legitimizing their ideas and narratives.“Statements like these are exactly what China’s goal is for influence campaigns,” he said.SPY AGENCY INTERESTChina’s interest in Utah is not limited to its officials and advocates who are engaged in diplomacy, trade and education. U.S. officials have noted that China’s civilian spy agency, the Ministry of State Security (MSS), has shown an interest in Utah, court records show.In January, former graduate student Ji Chaoqun was sentenced to eight years in prison on charges related to spying for China. The Chicago student told an undercover agent he’d been tasked by his spy handlers “to meet people, some American friends."" He was baptized at a Latter-day Saints church and told the undercover agent he'd “been going to Utah more often lately” before his arrest, according to his Facebook page and court records.Ron Hansen, a former U.S. intelligence official from Utah, pleaded guilty to trying to sell classified information to China. Hansen said China's spy service had tasked him with assessing various U.S. politicians’ views towards China. The FBI found the names of Utah elected officials among sensitive files he stored on his laptop, court records show. Hansen was sentenced in 2019 to serve 10 years in federal prison.Hansen was well known in Utah political circles and helped organize the first ever annual U.S.-China National Governors Forum, which was held in 2011 in Salt Lake City, according to court records and interviews. The U.S. State Department canceled the forums in 2020 due to concerns about Chinese influence efforts.‘UTAH IS NOT LIKE WASHINGTON D.C.’The AP found groups of up to 25 Utah lawmakers routinely took trips to China every other year since 2007. Lawmakers have partially used campaign donations to pay for the trade missions and cultural exchanges, while relying on China and host organizations to pay for other expenses.On the trips, they’ve forged relationships with government officials and were quoted in Chinese state-owned media in ways that support Beijing’s agenda.“Utah is not like Washington D.C.,” then Utah House Speaker Greg Hughes, a vocal supporter of former President Donald Trump, told the Chinese state media outlet in 2018 as the former president ratcheted up pressure on Beijing over trade. “Utah is a friend of China, an old friend with a long history.”In an interview last month with the AP, Hughes said the trips to China made him “bullish” about the country and prospects of improving trade. However, he said he now believes the visits were pretexts for Chinese officials to influence him and other lawmakers.“It’s a trip not worth taking,” Hughes said.Utah doesn’t require public officials to report in detail their foreign travel or personal finances, so it’s difficult to determine lawmakers' financial ties to China. Some of Utah’s most pro-China legislators, however, have China-related personal business connections.Sen. Curt Bramble told Courthouse News Service last year that his role as a part-time legislator and as a business consultant sometimes overlap and that he “had clients in China — a dozen at times — some of them on legislative tours, some on consulting.”In an interview with AP, Bramble said none of his clients are based in China; they only do business there. He declined to name them.Bramble, a Republican who represents a conservative district, also rejected fears of undue Chinese influence in Utah.“China’s not going anywhere. China’s going to be a world force. They’re going to be a player for the foreseeable future and trying to understand what that implies for the United States or for the state of Utah and get a concept of that seems to be a valuable endeavor,” he said.TIES FORGED BY TWO UTAH RESIDENTSMany of the Utah-China ties have been forged by two state residents with links to the Chinese government or to organizations that experts say are alleged front groups for China, including its civilian spy agency, the AP found.The two men advocated for and against resolutions, set up meetings between Utah lawmakers and Chinese officials, accompanied legislators on trips to China and provided advice on the best way to cultivate favor with Beijing, according to emails and interviews.In reviewing the AP’s findings, legal experts said the men’s connections with Chinese officials suggest that they should register with the Justice Department under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, known as FARA. The law generally requires anyone who works on behalf of a foreign entity to influence lawmakers or public perception, but its scope is the subject of significant debate and enforcement has been uneven.“If I were representing either of these individuals, I would have significant concerns about FARA exposure,” said Joshua Ian Rosenstein, an attorney who handles such matters.One of the men, Taowen Le, has championed China to religious and political leaders in Utah for decades. Le, a Chinese citizen, moved to Utah in the 1980s and has been a professor of information technology at Weber State University since 1998. Le converted in 1990 to the Mormon faith.From 2003 through 2017, Le had another job -- as a paid representative of China’s Liaoning provincial government. Provincial governments are largely controlled by Beijing and Liaoning has had a longstanding “sister” relationship with Utah.Le’s advocacy continued after he said he left Liaoning’s payroll, emails and interviews show. He has frequently forwarded messages from Chinese government officials to Utah lawmakers and helped the Chinese Embassy set up meetings with state officials.After embassy officials tried unsuccessfully last year to get staff for Utah Gov. Spencer Cox to schedule a get-together with China’s ambassador to the U.S., Le sent the governor a personal plea to take the meeting.“I still remember and cherish what you told me at the New Year Party held at your home,” Le wrote in a letter adorned with pictures of him and Cox posing together. “You told me that you trusted me to be a good messenger and friendship builder between Utah and China.”State Senate President Stuart Adams turned to Le when Utah was scrambling to obtain large quantities of drugs that Adams thought could be used as potential treatment against the coronavirus in early 2020, emails and interviews show.Le, who belongs to the same congregation as Adams, said in an email to another lawmaker that he was able to get the Chinese Embassy to assign two staffers to work “tirelessly” on the request until it was fulfilled.RELIGIOUS SALES PITCHA hallmark of Le’s approach is to utilize his religion in his pitches to lawmakers. He quoted scripture from the Bible and the Book of Mormon in his emails, text messages and letters, and sprinkled in positive comments that Russell Nelson, the church’s president-prophet, has made about China.Chinese officials have tried to cultivate friendly ties with the church. When visiting Utah, China's diplomats and officials often meet top church members as well as lawmakers, emails and other records show.Expanding to China has been a top goal for the church, which plays a heavy role in Utah politics and the state's overall identity. Many of the state’s residents lived abroad as missionaries, and several of Utah’s public schools have robust K-12 Chinese immersion programs.While the church has historically been an outspoken advocate for religious freedom, Le sought to stop Utah lawmakers from supporting religious figures or groups discriminated against by the Chinese government.When a Utah lawmaker sponsored a resolution in 2021 condemning China’s well-documented and brutal crackdown of its minority Muslim Uighurs, Le chastised the legislator in text messages and compared unflattering media coverage of the Chinese government to that of the church’s founder, Joseph Smith Jr.“Pray to God and seek guidance from the Holy Spirit as you ponder about these issues instead of solely relying on those biased media reports,” Le said.The resolution failed that year and a similar one introduced in January did not receive a hearing.CHINA'S ‘ADVANTAGES’Le has served as a board member of the China Overseas Friendship Association, which has ties to the United Front Work Department -- a Chinese Communist Party organization the U.S. government says engages in covert and malign foreign influence operations.A United Front publication profiled Le in 2020 after he attended a meeting in Beijing of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, a prestigious advisory body controlled by the Chinese Communist Party.“I deeply feel the advantages of China’s system,” Le told the publication.Le told the AP he was interviewed by the FBI in 2007 and 2018 about his Chinese government ties. He said his advocacy has always been self-directed.“I don’t consider myself a lobbyist because I’m not a lobbyist. I’m just someone who cherishes the relationship between the U.S. and China,” Le said in an interview in his Weber State office.Adams, the Senate president, said he feels otherwise.“I do believe he’s lobbying,” Adams said. “He advocates very hard on China.”LAWMAKER'S SON TURNED CHINA ADVOCATEAnother Utah resident whom lawmakers said regularly has advocated better relations with China was Dan Stephenson, the son of a former state senator and employee of a China-based consulting firm.Emails and other records show Stephenson advised the Utah Senate president on how to make a good impression with a Chinese ambassador and assisted a Chinese province in its unsuccessful efforts to build a ceramics museum in Utah.Stephenson has promoted China in Utah for several years and has boasted of being well connected with government officials there.“I’ve heard more than once from the mouths of Chinese government officials that China is prioritizing their relationship with Utah,” Stephenson told lawmakers at a committee hearing. That testimony came shortly after Stephenson accompanied Republican state Sen. Jake Anderegg on a trip to Shanghai and Beijing that included meetings with officials at China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.A few months after that trip, Stephenson provided Anderegg with the draft language for a pro-China resolution the state senator introduced in 2020 expressing solidarity with China during the pandemic, Anderegg told the AP.The resolution passed with near unanimous approval.A Chinese diplomat’s efforts to win passage of a similar resolution in Wisconsin failed, with the state’s Senate president publicly blasting it as a piece of propaganda.Anderegg told the AP that he was interviewed by FBI agents seeking information about the Utah resolution’s origins.“It seemed rather innocuous to me,” Anderegg said of his resolution. “But maybe it wasn’t.”Stephenson said the FBI has not contacted him and no Chinese government official played a role in the resolution.TIES TO ALLEGED FRONT GROUPSStephenson has links to Chinese groups allegedly active in covert foreign influence operations, documents show.He is a partner in the Shanghai-based consulting firm Economic Bridge International. The company’s chief executive, William Wang, is a Chinese citizen and council member of the China Friendship Foundation for Peace and Development, according to an online biography. The group is affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party’s United Front.Stephenson, also once worked for the China Academy of Painting, which has been used by China’s Ministry of State Security as a front for meeting and covertly influencing elites and officials abroad, according to Alex Joske, the author of the recently published book “Spies and Lies: How China’s Greatest Covert Operations Fooled the World.”Stephenson said he worked only briefly — without pay — for the China Academy of Painting. He added he did not witness any spy agency involvement.WORK ALIGNED WITH CHINESE GOVERNMENT'S DESIRESStephenson said he’s never taken any action at the direction of the Chinese government and never accepted compensation from it.“I work to promote Utah’s economy, to help American companies succeed in China, and to encourage healthy people-to-people and commercial ties,” Stephenson said.His work sometimes aligned with what Chinese government officials were seeking and in ways experts say likely helped the Chinese Communist Party's messaging.Stephenson urged Utah’s elected officials to make videos to air on Shanghai television to boost the spirits of that city’s residents early in 2020 as they battled COVID-19, according to emails obtained by AP.“You cannot buy this type of positive publicity for Utah in China,” Stephenson said in an email pitching the videos.The request originated with the Shanghai government, according to Stephenson’s email, and came as officials in China were scrambling to tamp down public fury at communist authorities for reprimanding a young doctor, who later died, over his repeated warnings about the disease's dangers.Many lawmakers recorded videos reading sample scripts Stephenson provided, and a compilation of those videos was uploaded to a Chinese social media website. The compilation ends with dozens of lawmakers in unison shouting “jiayou!”- a Chinese expression of encouragement -- on the Utah House and Senate floors.___Suderman reported from Washington.

After conducting an investigation, the baboon was found to have sustained gunshot wounds from a hunting rifle (獵槍), reported TVBS.Despite attempts by veterinarians to save the baboon, it succumbed to its injuries. Since the monkey is a protected animal, rifles are strictly regulated, and there were gunshot wounds on its body, the department will report the case to the police to commence a criminal investigation.TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — An olive baboon (Papio anubis), which had been on the loose for over two weeks, was finally captured in Taoyuan City on Monday (March 27).The baboon, which is 110 centimeters tall and weighs around 20 kilograms, was spotted last week in Taoyuan's Pingzhen District. By Monday morning, he was seen in Taoyuan’s Yangmei District.Later in the afternoon, members of the Taoyuan Department of Agriculture searched the outskirts of the Taiwan Railways Administration's Fugang Mechanical Engineering Depot.After narrowing the scope of their search, agriculture bureau personnel ""arrested and brought to justice"" the baboon at 3 p.m., reported UDN. The baboon had been reportedly darting from one location to another that morning.Earlier sighting of baboon. (Facebook, 我是新屋人 photo)When it ran into a house on Zhongzheng Road in the Fugang area of Yangmei District, agricultural bureau staff members were able to surround the monkey to keep her from escaping again. They then fired a tranquilizer dart, which quickly took effect.As the baboon became incapacitated, agricultural bureau personnel quickly threw a net over the animal and were finally able to take it into custody. As for where the baboon will be sent next, the Taoyuan Department of Agriculture was cited by TTV News as stating that because the baboon was injured during the capture, it will first be sent to Leofoo Village Theme Park to undergo medical treatment.It will then be transferred to the Taipei Zoo. The zoo will later hold a press conference to announce its plans for the creature.(Taoyuan Department of Agriculture photo)(Taoyuan Department of Agriculture photo)(Taoyuan Department of Agriculture photo)",2023/03/27,5228,Society

Such actions are not just imprudent, but also illegal according to local law, per UDN.Taitung County Government reiterated that grazing cattle must be kept more than 200 meters away from provincial highways. Any violators identified will be subject to fines ranging upwards of NT$60,000 (US$2,000).Taitung County Department of Agriculture released a statement today stating there have been many incidents of cows straying onto the county's provincial roads. Some of these incidents have even occurred at night time, where vision is reduced, leading to the accidental death of cattle.The recent drought around Taitung has severely impacted vegetation in mountain areas, causing much of it to wither and die. With less grass to feed cattle, livestock have had to go further to forage as well as rely upon supplemental nutrition and agricultural by-products.Taitung Agriculture Department Director Hsu Chia-hao (許家豪) appealed to farmers to abide by regulations as well as strengthen fence maintenance and cattle marking. These efforts can lessen the risk of cattle escaping and wandering closer to roads, endangering the lives of passers-by and threatening property.Additionally, he said his department would assign special personnel to monitor cattle grazing, warning farmers not to take any chances when it comes to their livestock grazing too close to busy roads.",2023/03/27,715,Environment

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847987,Gwyneth Paltrow accuser calls Utah ski crash 'serious smack',"PARK CITY, Utah (AP) — The man suing Gwyneth Paltrow over a 2016 skiing collision at an upscale Utah resort told a jury Monday that the actor-turned-lifestyle influencer crashed into him from behind and sent him “absolutely flying.”“All I saw was a whole lot of snow. And I didn’t see the sky, but I was flying,” said Terry Sanderson, a 76-year-old retired optometrist, calling the impact “a serious smack.”That’s the opposite of what Paltrow testified, and the jury has heard dueling narratives as the trial enters its second week. Paltrow said Sanderson was uphill and hit her from behind. He's suing her for more than $300,000, claiming she skied recklessly and that he has permanent brain damage from the crash that altered his personality.On the stand Friday, Paltrow said Sanderson knocked into her gently from behind but that the collision escalated as the two skidded down the beginner slope. She said his skis veered between her legs, causing her to briefly panic as she heard a man groaning behind her. Paltrow was present in court Monday.Sanderson recalled a screaming woman skiing out of control and hitting him square in the back. Craig Ramon, another skier who says he's the sole eyewitness to the collision, testified last week that he saw Paltrow hit Sanderson.Regardless of who hit who, both sides agree the two then fell down and Paltrow landed on top of Sanderson. Paltrow's attorneys have disputed the extent of Sanderson's injuries and post-crash disorientation, but both sides say the collision resulted in Sanderson's four broken ribs and a concussion.Sanderson was brought to tears throughout his testimony Monday, particularly when he appeared unable to focus or remember things.His legal team attempted to present his confusion and memory lapses to support their brain-damage argument. Paltrow's lawyers used it to undercut his reliability as a witness.Sanderson's testimony also resurfaced questions about the potential that a GoPro helmet camera may have documented the crash. Though no footage made it into evidence for the trial, attorneys have repeatedly questioned witnesses about an email one of his daughters sent that said: “I also can’t believe this is all on GoPro.”That daughter, Shae Herath, testified last week that her words were mere speculation that someone on the upscale mountain must be outfitted with a helmet camera because they are a fixture at ski resorts.Paltrow’s attorneys have continued to raise questions about what happened to the footage that Sanderson and his family members referred to.It became clear Monday the potentially explosive evidence wouldn't explode.Judge Kent Holmberg said online sleuths had found the link and that its contents would be included as evidence. It didn’t contain GoPro footage. Instead, it was to a chat between members of Sanderson’s ski group, in which Ramon — the man claiming to be the crash’s sole eyewitness — said on the day of the crash that Paltrow had crashed into Sanderson.“Terry was knocked out cold. Bad hit to the head!” Ramon wrote. “I did see the hit. Terry did not know his name.”The exchange made clear that Ramon thought Paltrow crashed into Sanderson years before any lawsuit was filed. It also shows Sanderson and those skiing with him knew the woman in the crash was Paltrow.After four-and-a-half days of Sanderson's attorneys calling witnesses, Paltrow's defense team has equal time to present their case. They brought one of her family's four ski instructors to the stand Monday afternoon. Attorneys said Monday that Paltrow's two teenage children, Moses and Apple, would have their depositions read into the record later in the week instead of appearing in court on the witness stand.Jurors sat transfixed as Paltrow's attorneys played computer animated reconstructions of how they say the collision occurred, with high enough resolution to show trees, children's ski coats and multiple vantage points.For their first witness, the defense called Eric Christiansen, a mustachioed 40-year veteran ski instructor who was giving a lesson to Paltrow's family at Deer Valley Resort the day of the collision. He said he was monitoring much of the mountain during the exact moment Sanderson and Paltrow collided and didn't see the moment of impact but saw what happened immediately before and after.In testimony that wandered into instruction about skiing technique, Christiansen said Paltrow was making “short radius turns” while Sanderson was skiing down the groomed run “edge to edge"" and “quite dynamically.”He said he remembered Paltrow landed on top of Sanderson because he approached and took her skis off, then Sanderson's.“I believe you told me once if a soccer player takes out someone’s legs, they’re underneath,” Paltrow's attorney, Steve Owens, said as he asked questions about the crash.Paltrow's attorneys plan to depose a slate of medical experts who are expected to undercut testimony from the neurologists, radiologists and psychologists hired by Sanderson's team.The trial has also touched on the habits and hobbies of wealthy people like Sanderson and Paltrow as well as the power — and burden — of celebrity. The amount of money at stake for both sides pales in comparison to the typical legal costs of a multiyear lawsuit, expert witnesses, a private security detail and high-resolution animation.Much of the questioning throughout the trial's first five days has revolved around Sanderson's motivation for suing Paltrow. Her attorneys have argued the lawsuit is an attempt by an “obsessed” man to exploit Paltrow's wealth and fame. Sanderson's attorneys have attempted to paint Paltrow as a carefree movie star who hurt an aging man and is unwilling to take responsibility for the fallout.“No one believed how serious my injuries were,” said Sanderson, who enjoyed wine tasting and international travel before the crash. “There was lots of insults added to that singular incident.”___Associated Press journalist Kiana Doyle in Seattle contributed to this report.",2023/03/28,382,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847988,Iraqi parliament passes controversial vote law amendments,"BAGHDAD (AP) — Iraqi lawmakers passed early Monday controversial amendments to the country's election law that could undermine the chances for smaller parties and independent candidates to win seats in future polls.The amendments increase the size of electoral districts, a move widely backed by the Coordination Framework, a coalition of Iran-backed parties. The coalition forms the majority bloc in the current parliament, which brought Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani to power last year.The bill passed in a 206-12 vote in the 329-seat assembly, according to media reports. The remaining lawmakers were absent from the hourslong session, which started on Sunday night.The amendments also reverse key articles passed ahead of the 2021 federal election and redraw the electoral maps to have Iraq return to one electoral district per each governorate.Several Iraqi political blocs and independent parliamentarians had rejected the amendments and stalled the vote for weeks. Hundreds of protesters gathered over the past weeks to voice their opposition.Independent lawmakers who objected to the law walked out of a previous session, causing it to be postponed due to a lack of quorum. They attempted to stall the vote again overnight by protesting and disturbing the count, before Iraqi security forces escorted them out of the assembly hall.On Saturday, hundreds protested in Baghdad against the new amendments, while some protesters in other parts of Iraq blocked roads with burning tires.“These amendments will only fortify the rulers in power and their corruption, and exclude independent and new political groups,"" one of the protesters, Mohamed Al-Daami, told The Associated Press. He described the amendments as “unjust.”Iraq's previous election law was adopted following mass anti-government protests in 2019. That legislation gave independent candidates and grassroots movements a better chance at winning seats. Its drafting and the subsequent 2021 elections involved technical assistance from the United Nations. The vote was lauded as a “substantial achievement” by Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, the U.N. special representative to Iraq.The outcome of that election shocked the Coordination Framework, which lost seats while its chief political rival, firebrand Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr was declared the clear victor.Al-Sadr's political bloc gained 74 seats in the 2021 polls, while the Fatah Coalition, made up of Iran-backed parties, lost nearly half of its votes and more than two-thirds of its seats, compared to the 2018 polls.Despite emerging as the clear winner in the election, al-Sadr did not win a parliamentary majority needed to form the government. An alliance with Sunni and Kurdish parties fell apart after the cleric, frustrated by months of political impasse, ordered his lawmakers to resign in a sudden move that many observers said was a miscalculation.The move allowed his political rivals in the Coordination Framework to amass the needed parliamentary majority to form the government and name al-Sudani as prime minister.Amending the electoral law and reversing the articles that effectively disempowered the ruling coalition from the vote emerged as a priority for the new government.Iraq's provincial elections are slated for Nov. 6, the country's first local vote in a decade. Independent candidates fear the elections under the new law will empower ruling parties, which they accuse of rampant corruption.The Iraqi government hast not yet scheduled the country's next general elections.",2023/03/27,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847989,Many rely on radio broadcasts in Zimbabwe and across Africa,"HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) — Just the size of his hand, the radio set hung in the busy marketplace stall is essential to Mark Nyabanda.“I can’t do without it,” said the 25-year old, taking a break from selling fertilizer in Mbare market in the capital, Harare, to listen to a radio weather report warning of possible floods.Radio bulletins also provide him with information on disease outbreaks, political news and entertainment, he said.“I don’t trust these new technologies,"" he said, referring to social media. ""They are full of falsehoods. We saw it during the coronavirus outbreak.”In many Western countries, conventional radio has been overtaken by streaming, podcasts and on-demand content accessed via smartphones and computers.But in many of Africa's 54 countries, with a combined population of 1.3 billion people, traditional radio sets are widely used, highlighting the digital divide between rich countries and those still struggling to have reliable internet.Radio sets are all over the place in Zimbabwe. Rural livestock herders dangle them from their necks while tending animals while those in the cities listen to their radio sets for news.When schools closed during the coronavirus pandemic, sub-Saharan African had the highest proportion of schoolchildren who lacked internet connectivity to participate in remote learning online lessons, according to the United Nations children’s agency. Many students relied on lessons beamed via tiny solar-powered radio sets at home.More than 80% of people in Africa own a mobile phone with access to a mobile phone network, according to Afrobarometer, a leading research institute. But “fewer than half” have mobile phones with internet access. The number of those who have access to computers at home is even lower at 28% of people polled in 34 African countries in a survey on the digital divide published in December last year.“Closing the digital divide remains a critical issue for most African countries, and for the continent as a whole,” said Afrobarometer.The lack of internet connectivity means traditional radio “remains king,” said Afrobarometer in another survey last year.Radio is “overwhelmingly” the most common source of news in Africa, according to the survey. About 68% of respondents said they tuned in at least a few times a week, compared to about 40% who use social media and the internet.Traditional radio sets are easy and inexpensive to use versus the higher cost and logistical problems of getting access to the internet.Many small radio sets now come with inbuilt solar panels that allow people to listen to broadcasts even when they don’t have electricity. Especially in vogue are radios that also now come with a cell phone charger and a flashlight — all huge conveniences in a continent where electricity outages are rampant and internet connection spots are often distant.“People don’t have to worry about network or data expenses. And one can’t be switched off for not paying license fees,” said Stanley Tsarwe, coordinator of journalism studies at the University of Zimbabwe. “The radio set has become very powerful and multi-functional and that becomes critical in Africa where access to power and access to the internet are very limited” he said.Many people trust information from their radio sets over other sources, said John Masuku, a veteran radio broadcaster of five decades.“There is a lot of disinformation and misinformation so people still want to check … if it is not said on radio then it is not fact. That is why radio is popular and celebrated in Africa,” he said.Broadcasts in local languages are also attract radio listeners. Zimbabwe's state radio and a host of community stations offer broadcasts in Shona, Ndebele and 12 other local languages, he said.However, the way many in Africa listen to the radio is changing as internet penetration improves. The number of people getting news at least “a few times a week” from either social media or the internet or both has almost doubled from 24% to 43% over the past decade, according to Afrobarometer.The falling prices of mobile phones that can access FM radio stations is also shifting how people listen to radio in Africa, said Tsarwe of the University of Zimbabwe.“There is an ongoing convergence between radio and digital mobile technologies, especially the mobile phone,"" he said. ""Radio is integrating more rapidly with the mobile phone because it is much more accessible in Africa. The mobile phone is the future of radio in Africa.”",2023/03/27,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847990,"Strike over pay paralyzes rail, air travel in Germany","BERLIN (AP) — Trains, planes and public transit systems stood still across much of Germany on Monday as labor unions called a major one-day strike over salaries in an effort to win inflation-busting raises for their members.The 24-hour walkout — one of the biggest in decades — also affected cargo transport by rail and ship, as workers at the country's ports and waterways joined the strike.Many commuters opted to drive to work, causing some delays on the roads, while those who could worked from home.Unions are seeking a pay increase of at least 10.5% and have dismissed offers from employers of about 5% over two years plus one-off payments.High inflation also seen elsewhere last year has hit many workers hard, said Ulrich Silberbach of the Civil Service Federation.“We have recorded drops in real wages and these need to be balanced out,” he told reporters in Berlin, adding that some of his union's members in larger cities are having to apply for state benefits to afford rent.Silberbach said that he hoped employers would increase their offer in upcoming talks — otherwise, unions might have to consider an open-ended strike.His colleague Martin Burkert from the EVG rail union lamented that workers' pay is a fraction of what some top managers earn.But rail company Deutsche Bahn called the union's demands exaggerated and warned that millions of commuters would be affected.“Thousands of companies that normally send or receive their goods by rail will also suffer,” Deutsche Bahn spokesman Achim Strauss said. “The environment and the climate will also suffer in the end. Today's winners are the oil companies.”Train tickets that couldn't be used because of the disruption will remain valid and travelers should check the company's website for updates, he said.Three days of talks are scheduled between the two sides. Interior Minister Nancy Faeser, who represents the federal government in the negotiations, said her side would engage in the discussions in a “tough but also fair and constructive” fashion.Faeser said she was confident that a good solution can be reached.Labor strikes are a regular occurrence in Germany and normally end in a compromise deal between unions and employers.The walkout already caused disruption and delays Sunday, as travelers scrambled to reach their destinations early.",2023/03/27,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847991,"Malaysia, Cambodia sign pacts on Cambodian workers","PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) — Malaysia and Cambodia signed two agreements on Monday on the employment of Cambodian migrant workers, as Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim made his first visit to Phnom Penh since becoming his country’s leader in November.Anwar was accompanied by his ministers of foreign affairs, religious affairs and human resources, Malaysia’s foreign ministry said ahead of his one-day trip.He held talks Monday morning with Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen and was to meet with King Norodom Sihamoni and top lawmakers later in the day.The two governments signed agreements on the recruitment, employment and repatriation of Cambodian workers in Malaysia. Malaysia, one of Southeast Asia’s richer countries, employs low-wage workers from Cambodia, one of the region’s poorer nations.Anwar's trip comes during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. He was also scheduled to meet with members of Cambodia’s small Islamic community, almost all of whom belong to the Cham ethnic minority. Islam is Malaysia’s official religion, while Cambodia’s population is predominantly Buddhist.At a news conference after meeting with Anwar, Hun Sen praised relations between the countries and said they agreed to promote cooperation in trade, agriculture, tourism, energy, education and industry. He urged Malaysia to buy more rice from Cambodia.Cambodia is Malaysia’s 58th largest trading partner and its eighth largest among the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, according to Malaysia's foreign ministry.Trade between Malaysia and Cambodia totaled $683.6 million in 2022, an increase of 20.8% from the previous year, it said.",2023/03/27,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847992,"José Abreu, Trea Turner among key players in new spots","CHICAGO (AP) — Baseball begins again on Thursday with opening day. For some players and managers, it's also their first regular-season game with a new team.Here is a closer look at a couple people in new places who could have a big impact this year:—1B José Abreu, Houston Astros: Abreu has been one of baseball's most consistent performers since his big league debut in 2014. He had at least 25 homers and 100 RBIs in six of his first nine seasons. The three-time All-Star hit .317 with 19 homers and 60 RBIs during the pandemic-shortened 2020 season, winning the AL MVP award.After beginning his major league career with the Chicago White Sox, Abreu finalized a $58.5 million, three-year contract with the World Series champions in November. The addition of Abreu — with his steady presence in the lineup and clubhouse — became even more significant when Houston second baseman Jose Altuve broke his right thumb during the World Baseball Classic.—SS Xander Bogaerts, San Diego Padres: One of the biggest surprises of free agency was Bogaerts' $280 million, 11-year contract with San Diego in December. But Bogaerts' deal strengthens the Padres' star-studded lineup and the team's infield defense.The 30-year-old Bogaerts won two World Series titles while spending his first 10 years with Boston. He hit .307 with 15 homers and 73 RBIs in his final season with the Red Sox. With Bogaerts in the fold, the Padres could have four players with shortstop experience in their starting infield — perfect timing with baseball's new limits on defensive shifting.—OF Daulton Varsho, Toronto Blue Jays: Varsho was acquired in a December trade after he set career highs with 27 homers, 74 RBIs and 16 steals in 151 games with Arizona last year. He was selected by the Diamondbacks in the second round of the 2017 draft and spent his first three seasons with the team.The 26-year-old Varsho should help balance Toronto's heavily right-handed lineup, which also includes Vladimir Guerrero Jr., Bo Bichette, Matt Chapman and George Springer. He also is a versatile defensive upgrade in the outfield who can even fill in at catcher in a pinch.—SS Trea Turner, Philadelphia Phillies: Turner's $300 million, 11-year contract with the NL champions sure seems like an ideal match of player and team. Turner brings his speed and athleticism to a Philadelphia lineup that — at full strength — includes sluggers Bryce Harper, Kyle Schwarber and J.T. Realmuto.Turner, a World Series winner with Washington in 2019, hit .298 with 21 homers and a career-high 100 RBIs for the Los Angeles Dodgers last year. He also swiped 27 bags in 2022, and the bigger bases and new limits on pickoffs could make him an even more dangerous baserunner this season.—Manager Pedro Grifol, Chicago White Sox: There is lots of talent on the White Sox, who have ace right-hander Dylan Cease atop their rotation and All-Star shortstop Tim Anderson in their lineup. But the team flopped to an 81-81 record last year and missed the playoffs after making the previous two postseasons.Enter Grifol, who was hired in November after Tony La Russa stepped down late last season because of health issues. Grifol, a former minor league catcher, spent the previous 10 seasons in a variety of coaching roles with Kansas City. He was widely praised during spring training for his attention to detail and the pace of the team's workouts, but there is pressure to get the club turned around this year.—C Sean Murphy, Atlanta Braves: Murphy was acquired in a three-team trade in December in Atlanta's biggest offseason move. The Braves, winners of five consecutive NL East titles, then signed the catcher to a $73 million, six-year contract, counting on his continued development behind the plate.The 28-year-old Murphy set career highs with a .250 batting average, 18 homers and 66 RBIs in 148 games with Oakland last season. He also is known for his defense, winning a Gold Glove in 2021. Murphy and Travis d’Arnaud should give Atlanta one of baseball's best catching tandems.___Follow Jay Cohen at https://twitter.com/jcohenap___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/28,,World

Over 90 children were sent home while the school notified the local health department about the possible norovirus or enterovirus cluster infection or food poisoning case.Students’ vomit and the school lunch provided on Friday (March 24) were submitted for testing.By Sunday, over 180 students were experiencing discomfort. 368 students took Monday off, including those who did not show obvious symptoms but whose parents wanted to avoid the risk of them getting infected at school.At the time of publishing, the school was still waiting for test results to be announced. Yahoo News cited the school’s Principal Cheng Li-chuan as saying reports are expected in two weeks.As norovirus is very contagious, outbreaks occur easily. After observing a rise in cases in February, the Taoyuan Department of Public Health urged schools and food service providers to stay alert and reinforce food safety management.Norovirus is immune to ethanol and hand sanitizers, so members of the public should wash their hands often with soap, per Heho. They should also separate cooked and raw ingredients when cooking, and avoid eating raw eggs, meats, or shellfish.Those who experience diarrhea should wait at least 48 hours after symptoms are gone before returning to work or school to reduce the chance of spreading the virus. Other symptoms caused by the virus include nausea, vomiting, stomachache, fever, chills, fatigue, headache, and soreness.Young children may experience more severe vomiting for one to 10 days before gradually recovering.",2023/03/27,2873,Food Safety & Health

HONG KONG SAR -  Media OutReach - 27 March 2023 -  ""The ReStart Art Club"", the annual private party hosted by  Princess Alia Al-Senussi and  Dino Sadhwani during Art Basel Hong Kong returned this year after a hiatus due to the global pandemic and was held on Thursday, 23rd March 2023 at K11 ATELIER King's Road. This one-night only event brought together the global creative community and luminaries from different disciplines across regions to celebrate the reinvigoration of the international art scene in Hong Kong.     Hosts & Host Chairs of ""The ReStart Art Club""                          (From Left) Michael Govan, Eva Chow, Adrian Cheng, Dino Sadhwani, Princess Alia Al-Senussi, Philip Tinari & Alan Lau   Curated by Jason Swamy and produced by COI Communications, the theme of this year was an exploration of the binaries of art - familiar and foreign, digital and analog, acoustic and electronic, while showcasing the confluence of age, ethnicities, and cultures.   To highlight the concept of dualisms, the event was chosen to be held at K11 ATELIER King's Road, a contemporary office space with a vertical creative city concept, while the set paid homage to the industrial heritage of the area.   Art Basel Hong Kong's largest private event honoring movers and shakers of the art world returns   Alongside the hosts, this event was brought together by 5 distinguished Host Chairs: Adrian Cheng of K11 Group,  Alan Lau of M+,  Eva Chow of LACMA, along with  Michael Govan of LACMA and  Philip Tinari of UCCA, both of whom have participated in previous editions of the event, as well as 18 esteemed Host Committee members from around the region.   Celebrating arts, culture, and creativity in all shapes and forms   As guests arrived the venue, they were instantly met with a blend of cultures through a Chinese music performance with a modern twist, where musicians performed amidst an elevated stage full of larger-than-life flowers, and dancers dressed in matching colored body suits were concealed within the installation and emerged to greet and interact with guests.   Tying in the themes of nature and dualities, guests were then invited to enjoy a Five Flower Tea infused gin cocktail before traversing through the depths of nature at the digital exhibit created by d'strict at ARTE M Hong Kong, which is the first ever overseas showcase of Korea's largest immersive media art exhibition. In the future, ARTE M Hong Kong will move to 11 SKIES, Hong Kong's largest retailtainment new landmark, with more works added to the collection in a larger space with F&B facilities as a permanent exhibition.   Guests were then offered a molecular sphere cocktail and guided into a lift with an eccentric dance performance to continue their journey. The lift opened into an unrefined yet mysterious speakeasy decorated with traditional Hong Kong and industrial elements where spectacular performances were unveiled sequentially.   An endless night of enthralling performances from award-winning virtuosos    The 2023 edition saw over 8 local and international acts which were flown in from Ukraine, Switzerland, United States, Mexico, France, Philippines, Taiwan and more. One of the highlights of the evening at The Amber Room was an enthralling set by Sly5thAve, a Grammy-award winning musician. A dramatic curtain reveal marked the beginning of a high energy dance performance at The Green Room, followed by a riveting solo performance by accordion player Mario Batkovic, and DJ and dance performances that continued throughout the night.   A range of canapés inspired by local flavors and the Hong Kong dim sum culture were offered to guests to pay homage to our vibrant city, and beverages were sponsored by Two Moons Distillery, Moët & Chandon, Don Julio 1942, and KHEE Soju. Within the speakeasy, there was also a dragon-i branded lounge area, which served as a forerunner to the after-party that continued at the club.   Other contributing artists at the event included Min Joon Lee, the international collective Hyper Futurism with a curation of digital artworks, and Magic Room with a selection of Hong Kong-styled neon signs.   The hosts, Princess Alia Al-Senussi and Dino Sadhwani, have successfully created yet another captivating, fun-filled event and captured the spirit of reconnecting and restarting. The party lived up to the hype from its previous editions and will certainly be remembered as a must go-to event in the calendar during Art month in Hong Kong. It is hoped that the event will continue the success in celebrating the collaboration among people passionate about art and culture, performance, gastronomy, music and entertainment.

Among them is, in particular, the possibility of stubbornly high global inflation accompanied by tepid growth, reminiscent of the stagflation of the 1970s. This could eventually result in a sharp tightening of monetary policy in advanced economies to rein in inflation, lead to surging borrowing costs, and possibly culminate in financial stress in some emerging market and developing economies.

These restrictions have affected not only airlines but also other industries that rely on air transportation, such as tourism, international trade, and logistics. The market in 2022 has also been damaged by the war. The conflict has led to a decrease in consumer and investor confidence, as well as disruptions in supply chains and logistics. The effects have been felt across many industries, including energy, manufacturing, and agriculture.Download Free Sample of This Strategic Report: https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=aa2322The war has also had significant geopolitical implications. It has raised defense spending in many countries and strengthened the armed forces of NATO nations. European nations, in particular, have increased their defense budgets in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. For example, Germany earmarked USD 109 billion, which is more than the whole cost of its military in 2021, in order to increase its defense spending above 2% of GDP. The war has also led to increased tensions between Russia and other countries, particularly in Europe, and has raised concerns about the potential for further military conflicts in the future.An active antenna is one that has active electronic components (i.e., transistors) and is not simply composed of passive parts such as metal rods, capacitors, and conductors. Included in this category are smart antennas, remote radio head antennas, and beamforming antennas. These will all play an increasingly important role in the network, and the ratio of active antennas is estimated to grow from nearly 6 percent in 2017 to over 13 percent by 2024. Much of this growth will be driven by MIMO and Massive MIMO configurations.The base station antenna market is segmented on the basis of application, and region.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848075,"Taiwan tech startup inspired by alien language that thinks in past, present, future","TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Alan Chan (詹雨安) dropped out of university to co-found Heptabase, a Taiwanese-founded U.S. startup with a Taiwan-based team, that helps users store, organize, and share data, and has recently secured US$1.7 million dollars in seed funding.Speaking to the Startup Island TAIWAN Podcast, Chan described the “knowledge networks” that users can create with Heptabase. Since new concepts are not always immediately applied, Chan said that the software allows users to create and store notes about concepts they are learning and access them when it is time to apply that knowledge.Chan said he found Heptabase’s first users via social media app Telegram. He said he searched ""visual, whiteboard, mind map,"" on Telegram, found interested users, and sent them a prototype so that they could provide feedback.“So, the community grew organically; it went from zero to one to five, to now I think about 6000 members across 82 countries,” Chan said. He said that the team produces a new iteration of the product every day or two and that the product ships fast.Chan said Heptabase is primarily focusing on the individual’s process of creating. “We believe it is more important to create a tool that can augment individual thinking before we can evolve this tool into a collective intelligence tool,” he said.Chan said that Heptabase’s long-term approach is about building metadata and utilizing the information to find new ways to search for information. “I think we could create a new way that we have not seen before for discovering knowledge based on context rather than based on a keyword,” he said.He said the name Heptabase was inspired by fictional aliens from science fiction literature whose language could communicate the past, present, and future simultaneously. “That gives you a feeling about why I built Heptabase,” Chan said, “it is about connecting knowledge between the past, present, and future, while preserving all the original context.”Heptabase is currently entirely reliant on word of mouth for new users and does not have any trial plans available.",2023/03/27,1596,Business

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848096,Jack Ma returns to China as government tries to quell private sector fears,"HONG KONG/BEIJING, March 27 (Reuters) - Alibaba (9988.HK) founder Jack Ma has returned to China, ending a more than year-long stay overseas that was viewed by industry as reflecting the sober mood of China's private businesses and troubled policymakers trying to spur the economy.
The return of China's best-known entrepreneur may help to quell the concerns of the country’s private-sector businesses after a bruising two-year regulatory crackdown. His public reemergence provides support for the government's softening tone toward the private sector as leaders try to shore up an economy battered by three years of COVID curbs.
Online discussion saying that Ma was in China began emerging on Chinese social media early on Monday and his return was confirmed by a school he had visited and the Alibaba-owned South China Morning Post newspaper.
Ma, a former English teacher, discussed topics such as artificial intelligence-powered chatbot ChatGPT and also said he hoped to return to teaching one day during his visit, the Yungu School said on its official WeChat account. The school was founded by Ma and other Alibaba founders in the e-commerce giant's home city of Hangzhou in 2017.
He returned to China last week, two sources with knowledge of the matter said. Reuters was not able to establish how long he plans to stay in China this time round.
Ma's return ""boosts the sentiment of the broader platform, internet industry,"" said Zhang Zihua, chief investment officer at Beijing Yunyi Asset Management.
""Because that means the new top leadership has indeed been re-examining the position and the importance of the platform companies in China's economic development. The previous restrictive policies on the platform, internet sector are also expected to be adjusted,"" Zhang said.
Alibaba shares jumped more than 4% after news of Ma's return broke before giving up some of its gains.
LI'S REQUEST
Ma's stay abroad came to symbolize the reversal of fortunes for the country's private sector after his empire and the technology industry were the targets of Beijing's regulatory crackdown.
A speech Ma gave in 2020 criticising China's regulatory system is commonly accepted as the spark for the tighter government scrutiny and triggered his public retreat. In late 2021 he left Mainland China and has been seen in photographs in Japan, Spain, Australia and Thailand.
While Chinese authorities have recently said they are easing the crackdown and would support the private sector, Chinese entrepreneurs and investors said they saw Ma's decision to stay overseas as a factor hindering confidence.
Recognising this, China's new Premier Li Qiang had since late last year asked Ma to return to the mainland, hoping that this would boost business confidence among entrepreneurs, five sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
Some of these efforts involved asking people close to Ma such as his business associates to persuade the Alibaba founder in person while he was living in Japan, two of the sources said.
Reuters was not immediately able to establish whether Ma had returned due to Li's efforts.
Alibaba and the State Council did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Li, a close ally of President Xi Jinping, has been at the forefront of government's effort to bolster the private sector, saying earlier this month that the country's environment for entrepreneurial businesses will improve and that Beijing will treat all firms equally.
However, companies are hesitant, privately pointing to a lack of new supportive policies and the new regulatory framework the crackdown had brought.
That view is shared by long-time Asia analyst Fraser Howie, who has written several books on China's financial system.
""I can see how this sort of signals a relaxation but none of the laws and institutions set up to control the private sector have changed,"" he said.
""It doesn't matter at all to private business because he is already beaten. The State won, Jack has lost control, power, wealth and its not coming back.""HONG KONG/BEIJING, March 27 (Reuters) - Alibaba (9988.HK) founder Jack Ma has returned to China, ending a more than year-long stay overseas that was viewed by industry as reflecting the sober mood of China's private businesses and troubled policymakers trying to spur the economy.The return of China's best-known entrepreneur may help to quell the concerns of the country’s private-sector businesses after a bruising two-year regulatory crackdown. His public reemergence provides support for the government's softening tone toward the private sector as leaders try to shore up an economy battered by three years of COVID curbs.Online discussion saying that Ma was in China began emerging on Chinese social media early on Monday and his return was confirmed by a school he had visited and the Alibaba-owned South China Morning Post newspaper.Ma, a former English teacher, discussed topics such as artificial intelligence-powered chatbot ChatGPT and also said he hoped to return to teaching one day during his visit, the Yungu School said on its official WeChat account. The school was founded by Ma and other Alibaba founders in the e-commerce giant's home city of Hangzhou in 2017.He returned to China last week, two sources with knowledge of the matter said. Reuters was not able to establish how long he plans to stay in China this time round.Ma's return ""boosts the sentiment of the broader platform, internet industry,"" said Zhang Zihua, chief investment officer at Beijing Yunyi Asset Management.""Because that means the new top leadership has indeed been re-examining the position and the importance of the platform companies in China's economic development. The previous restrictive policies on the platform, internet sector are also expected to be adjusted,"" Zhang said.Alibaba shares jumped more than 4% after news of Ma's return broke before giving up some of its gains.Ma's stay abroad came to symbolize the reversal of fortunes for the country's private sector after his empire and the technology industry were the targets of Beijing's regulatory crackdown.A speech Ma gave in 2020 criticising China's regulatory system is commonly accepted as the spark for the tighter government scrutiny and triggered his public retreat. In late 2021 he left Mainland China and has been seen in photographs in Japan, Spain, Australia and Thailand.While Chinese authorities have recently said they are easing the crackdown and would support the private sector, Chinese entrepreneurs and investors said they saw Ma's decision to stay overseas as a factor hindering confidence.Recognising this, China's new Premier Li Qiang had since late last year asked Ma to return to the mainland, hoping that this would boost business confidence among entrepreneurs, five sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.Some of these efforts involved asking people close to Ma such as his business associates to persuade the Alibaba founder in person while he was living in Japan, two of the sources said.Reuters was not immediately able to establish whether Ma had returned due to Li's efforts.Alibaba and the State Council did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Li, a close ally of President Xi Jinping, has been at the forefront of government's effort to bolster the private sector, saying earlier this month that the country's environment for entrepreneurial businesses will improve and that Beijing will treat all firms equally.However, companies are hesitant, privately pointing to a lack of new supportive policies and the new regulatory framework the crackdown had brought.That view is shared by long-time Asia analyst Fraser Howie, who has written several books on China's financial system.""I can see how this sort of signals a relaxation but none of the laws and institutions set up to control the private sector have changed,"" he said.""It doesn't matter at all to private business because he is already beaten.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848097,Rhodes ready to take his place in WrestleMania spotlight,"World Wrestling Entertainment’s prodigal son could become its undisputed champion on April 2.Cody Rhodes will face Roman Reigns in the main event of this year’s WrestleMania looking to write the final chapter of a story that began seven years ago when he left the company. When Rhodes departed in 2016, he was mired in playing different characters with no hopes of being a top-card wrestler.He spent the time on the independent circle, including Ring of Honor, before becoming one of the significant figures in the formation of All Elite Wrestling, which has become the biggest competitor to WWE since WCW in the late ’90s.Rhodes came back to a hero's welcome at last year’s WrestleMania. A torn pectoral muscle last June put a slight roadblock to the comeback, but Rhodes returned in late January and won the Royal Rumble. That set up his match with Reigns, who will put his 946-day championship reign on the line April 2 at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles.“It’s satisfying and vindicating. But it’s hard for me to look at it and say, ‘Hey, I told you so. I knew I had it,’ unless I beat Roman Reigns,” said Rhodes about his comeback.During his interview with The Associated Press, Rhodes also discussed his father, previewed his match against Reigns and reflected on the past seven years.AP: The main event between you and Roman looks like two wrestlers peaking at the right time.RHODES: I’m from Georgia, so there’s an element I see a little differently in the sense that Roman’s not a Bulldog; he’s a Yellow Jacket. Roman went to Georgia Tech, the MIT of the South. I’m sure MIT people are freaking out that I’m saying that, but it’s not an easy school to get into. That forms his wrestling IQ. His conditioning is that of a high-level athlete. That’s why he was able to stand in there with Brock Lesnar (last year) and look the part. You mentioned he’s peaking at this point. That’s a scary thought if you think about the success he’s already had. What might be in my favor is simply the fact that I don’t think Roman knows enough about what I’ve done and who I am. My thing is taking something that wrestling purists, analysts, observers, and journalists say cannot be done or will ever be done again and subverting those expectations.AP: This main event, more than others at WrestleMania, has the feelings of a family story due to your dad (who passed away in 2015). It’s Dusty Rhodes’ son against one of “Dusty’s Kids” that he trained at NXT.RHODES: When he passed away, “Dusty’s Kids” was something that I heard a lot because his influence and legacy were being spread out. That was a statistic being touted. Bayley, Sasha (Banks), Becky (Lynch), Seth (Rollins), Roman, Sami (Zayn), Kevin (Owens), the core ones, were all doing better than I was. It wasn’t something I could complain about or throw a tantrum over because they were honoring him. It almost felt like they were honoring him more than I was. And there’s jealousy and envy that comes with it. I would have loved to have done a promo class or been around a ring with my father. I got a far different education from him than they did. But that’s why in these interviews, even on nights I don’t want to say his name or talk about him, you hear it nonetheless because his fingerprints are all over WrestleMania. Every one of those people I just named, for the most part, is doing something spectacular. You want to add yourself to that list, and you almost can’t function if you don’t. I feel like that’s slightly weaponized in a sense by Roman toward me. I wasn’t adjusted and ready for it. I’m ready for it now.AP: You already had a lot of support from fans when you returned last year, but it seemed like you picked up more after going through with your match with Seth Rollins after suffering a torn pec while preparing for the match because people could see what you were going through physically.RHODES: It was just a matter of I had to do it. The doctor said I couldn’t hurt it anymore, and I had the surgery lined up. I don’t want to be dramatic and say I could not live with myself, but that’s not the type of wrestler or athlete I was brought up to be. Every person who texted me and gave me these wonderful superlatives about it, I said you would have done the same thing. That crowd needed that match, and I was going to have that match.AP: It might be hard looking at it right now, but how is life for Cody Rhodes after the past 3-4 years?RHODES: Life is splendid. When I left my former gig to come back to WWE, it was a far bigger gamble than “All In” (the first AEW show in 2019) ever was. That’s why I get these “All In” vibes when I think about WrestleMania because I certainly could have been the laughingstock of the industry. And going into the biggest event ever involved in the wrestling ring from any measurable standpoint is one part of life being great, blessed and lucky. The other part is I have my family in terms of Brandy (his wife) and Liberty (his daughter), for them to come to this and experience this knowing that it wasn’t a life wasted. Every sacrifice I’ve made, early morning gym trip, times I wasn’t able to be home or won’t be able to be home, it’s not a life wasted in what we do and that makes this run just all the sweetest.___AP Sports: https://apnews.com/hub/sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/27,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848098,Prince Harry in court for privacy suit against tabloid,"LONDON (AP) — Prince Harry and Elton John were in a London court Monday as the lawyer for a group of British tabloids prepared to ask a judge to toss the lawsuit they brought with several other high-profile people who allege phone tapping and other invasions of privacy.Harry’s presence at the High Court in London is a sign of the importance he attaches to the case, one of several lawsuits the Duke of Sussex has brought against the media. The hearing is expected to last four days.The case alleges Associated Newspapers Ltd., which publishes titles including the Daily Mail, commissioned the “breaking and entry into private property,” engaging in unlawful acts that included hiring private investigators to bug homes and cars and record private phone conversations.“They were the victim of numerous unlawful acts carried out by the defendant, or by those acting on the instructions of its newspapers, The Daily Mail and The Mail On Sunday,” attorney David Sherborne said in a court document.Other plaintiffs include John’s husband, David Furnish, and actresses Liz Hurley and Sadie Frost, who was also in court. John arrived after a lunch break in sat in the gallery. Harry sat near the rear of the court and took notes as attorneys discussed preliminary matters.The allegations date back to 1993 and continue beyond 2018, Sherborne said.The publisher said the claims are too old to be brought now and should also be thrown out because because they rely on information the newspapers turned over in confidentiality for a 2012 probe into media law breaking.“It would be surprising indeed for any reasonably informed member of the public, let alone a figure in the public eye, to have been unaware of these matters,” attorney Adrian Beltrami said in writing.Britain held a year-long inquiry into press ethics after revelations in 2011 that News of the World tabloid employees eavesdropped on the mobile phone voicemails of celebrities, politicians and a teenage murder victim.Owner Rupert Murdoch shut down the newspaper amid a criminal investigation and public uproar. Several journalists were convicted, and Murdoch’s company paid millions in damages to dozens of hacking victims.In the inquiry’s 2012 report, Lord Justice Brian Leveson said “outrageous” behavior by some in the press had “wreaked havoc with the lives of innocent people whose rights and liberties have been disdained.”Judge Matthew Nicklin, who is hearing the current eavesdropping case, is also overseeing a separate libel lawsuit Harry brought against Associated Newspapers over an article about his quest for police protection when he and his family visit the U.K.Harry, the younger son of King Charles III, and his wife, the former actress Meghan Markle, stepped down as working royals in 2020 and moved to the U.S., citing what they described as the unbearable intrusions and racist attitudes of the British media.Harry has said he wants to make reforming the British media his life’s work. He fumes at the U.K. media throughout his memoir “Spare,” published in January. He blamed an overly aggressive press for the 1997 death of his mother, Princess Diana, and also accused the media of hounding Meghan.The couple has turned to British courts to combat what they see as media mistreatment. In December 2021, Meghan won an invasion-of-privacy case against Associated Newspapers over the Mail on Sunday’s publication of a letter she wrote to her estranged father.Harry is also suing the publisher of another tabloid, the Mirror, in a separate hacking suit.",2023/03/27,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848099,Cristiano Ronaldo happy again with Portugal's national team,"Cristiano Ronaldo is feeling at home again.It took only two games for him to make his peace with Portugal’s national team and show he is not done impressing at the international level just yet.In his return after a disappointing World Cup and a controversial move to Saudi soccer, the 38-year-old Ronaldo scored four goals in Portugal’s first two games in 2024 European Championship qualifying, showing he remains the leader that fans got used to seeing wearing the national team’s red and green uniform.Ronaldo netted twice in the 6-0 rout of Luxembourg on Sunday, three days after scoring another brace in the 4-0 win over Liechtenstein, when he became the men’s player with the most international appearances with 197.“Two games, two victories,” the Portugal captain said on his social media accounts after the win at Luxembourg. “Happy to have contributed to a very positive start by our national team. Let’s go.”The goals came against European minnows but seemed to be enough to restore Ronaldo's confidence and his role as a starter with the national team.Ronaldo was in tears the last time he left the field with Portugal following a loss to Morocco in the quarterfinals of the World Cup in Qatar last year after he was benched by then coach Fernando Santos in the knockout stage.The disappointing World Cup, added to his decision to accept a lucrative deal from Saudi club Al Nassr, had put in doubt his future with the national team. He said last week he wasn’t sure if he would ever play internationally again and only returned after reflecting with his family and realizing it wasn’t time to “throw in the towel” yet.Also likely playing a part in his decision to keep playing was the arrival of coach Roberto Martínez to replace Santos after the World Cup. The Spaniard pledged to respect Ronaldo’s history, and the star forward said he welcomed the “breath of fresh air” to the national team.Martínez said he was thrilled with the attitude shown by Ronaldo in the coach's first two games in charge.“Ronaldo is a unique player and brings a lot of experience to the locker room,” the former Belgium coach said. “He is a reference and is prepared to be a leader and a captain of this national team.”With his four goals at the start of the Martínez era, Ronaldo extended his international scoring record to 122 goals, 13 more than former Iran striker Ali Daei. Ronaldo’s 198th international appearance on Sunday left him two ahead of Kuwait’s Bader Al-Mutawa.Portugal, the 2016 European champion, plays its next two matches against Bosnia-Herzegovina and Iceland in June. The team leads Group J in Euro 2024 qualifying with six points, two more than Slovakia. The top two finishers in each group will advance to the tournament in Germany next summer.And if Ronaldo remains as happy and motivated as he is now, he will certainly be there to try to help Portugal win yet another European trophy. ___Tales Azzoni on Twitter: http://twitter.com/tazzoni___AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/27,,World

Therefore, Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Lo Chih-cheng (羅致政) on Friday (March 24) held a public hearing in which experts and scholars discussed the problem.Chung Hui-yu (鍾慧諭), deputy director of the Feng Chia University Innovation Center for Intelligent Transportation and Logistics, stated that Taiwan's transportation network is already a national security issue, and ""we don't have 100 years to wait."" Chung called for the design of national road specifications.Lo said that the number of traffic accident deaths and injuries remains high in Taiwan, with nearly 3,000 people dying in traffic accidents every year. The Ministry of Communications is expected to propose a draft of the Basic Law of Road Traffic Safety in April.Lo said Taiwan must ""get rid of this pedestrian hell"" and expressed hope that citizen groups and experts will also propose a version of the draft law. Lo argued that ""only when good and clear laws are issued from above can those below follow them.""According to data from the National Police Agency, there was a total of 50,832 cases of vehicles failing to stop for pedestrians on crosswalks in 2022, an increase of 157% from the 32,464 cases reported over the same period in 2021. This year, there have already been 13,069 cases from January to February alone, an increase of 71% from the 7,639 cases reported in 2022.The Cabinet has requested that priority improvements be given to areas that surround school campuses. Since 2013, more than 1,400 fines for such violations have not been paid, while the number of violations has also increased significantly and many of them are repeat offenders, which means that law enforcement has not achieved the desired deterrent effect, said Chen.Chung pointed out that the driver's license exam and traffic violation systems are too lax in Taiwan, and in the U.S., Europe, and Japan there are stricter penalties. Traffic violation points in many other countries can last for three years, while in Taiwan the points expire after six months.Chung said that the system in Taiwan is flawed and needs to be changed for the sake of national security.",2023/03/27,4438,Society

West Ham defender Thilo Kehrer came on for the Borussia Dortmund defender toward the end of the game against Peru and Flick said Monday he'll start against Belgium in Cologne.AC Milan defender Malick Thiaw was the only other potential option in Flick’s squad because the Germany coach did not call up Real Madrid defender Antonio Rüdiger or Dortmund center back Niklas Süle for the two friendlies. Southampton defender Armel Bella-Kotchap is out with a shoulder injury.Havertz, who is out with a cold, had played well against Peru behind the front two of Niclas Füllkrug and Timo Werner. Serge Gnabry will take Havertz's place against Belgium, Flick said.“Otherwise there may be one change, maybe two,” said Flick, who wanted to use the games against Peru and Belgium to learn about his players’ capabilities and build confidence after years of disappointment at major tournaments.“We want to take the next step,” the Germany coach said. “We tried (against Peru) to have a good defensive setup, compact in length and breadth, and it worked well at times. Sometimes there's still potential for improvement. And that's what we want to achieve against Belgium.”Germany will host next year's European Championship.Belgium, which started Euro 2024 qualifying with a 3-0 win at Sweden last week, will be without regular goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois. The Read Madrid player was allowed to return to his club as a precaution because of “a minor strain in the adductor,” the team said.Like Germany, Belgium is going through a rebuilding process under coach Domenico Tedesco following its World Cup exit in the group stage.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848145,Who is bidding to buy English soccer club Manchester United?,"MANCHESTER, England (AP) — The race to buy Manchester United is taking shape.Based on the publicly declared bids for one of the world's most iconic soccer teams, the frontrunners are Qatari banker Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad Al Thani and local boy-turned-billionaire Jim Ratcliffe.There is also the possibility that the current American owners, the Glazer family, could yet retain control of the team, despite raising hopes among supporters they would finally walk away after repeated attempts by fans to drive them out.After a second round of bidding last week, Sheikh Jassim and Ratcliffe remain in contention for what is likely to be the biggest ever sale of a sports team, with the price estimated to reach up to $6 billion.Sheikh Jassim's latest offer was placed on Friday night, a person with knowledge of the bid said.The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly.American merchant bank Raine's decision to extend the deadline for the rival bidders to fine-tune their second bids has added to the feeling that it is effectively a two-horse race if there is to be an outright takeover of the 20-time English league champions.Raine is handling the proposed sale on behalf of the Glazers and is also exploring other “strategic alternatives” that may see the family remain in place by selling a minority stake or take up other funding options.The Glazers, who also own the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, want the process to be completed in time for the start of the offseason transfer window, when prospective new owners would be expected to invest significantly in the team.Finnish entrepreneur Thomas Zilliacus declared his interest over the past week. His plans include a 50% shared ownership scheme with fans.But it is Sheikh Jassim and Ratcliffe who appear to be leading the way.QATARI SHEIKHSheikh Jassim is the chairman of Qatar Islamic Bank and he is the son of a former prime minister.He has submitted an offer to buy out the Glazer family, with the bid said to be completely separate from Qatari-owned Paris Saint-Germain.Sheikh Jassim, who is described as a United fan, plans to buy the club through his Nine Two Foundation, which was named after the club's famed Class of '92 youth team that produced stars like David Beckham and Ryan Giggs. That was also the year he became a supporter.While concerns have been raised about Qatar's human rights record, Sheikh Jassim's plans will appeal to fans on a number of levels.He has promised to rid the club of debt, invest in the stadium, training center and playing squads in a bid to “return the club to its former glories both on and off the pitch.”Meanwhile, supporters would hope a Qatar-based owner would be able to compete with the exorbitant spending of Manchester City, which is owned by Abu Dhabi's ruling family and has dominated English soccer for the past 10 years.JIM RATCLIFFEThe billionaire owner of petrochemicals giant INEOS is one of Britain's richest people and a United fan since childhood.Born in Failsworth, Greater Manchester, he says he is focused on United winning the Champions League for the first time since 2008 and making it the “number one club in the world once again.”Ratcliffe has bid for the Glazers' stake of about 69%, a person with knowledge of the offer said.The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because details of the bid have not been made public.INEOS says it is aiming for “a modern, progressive, fan-centered approach to ownership.”Ratcliffe is said to be worth $15.1 billion and already owns French club Nice, cycling franchise Team INEOS, is one-third shareholder of the Mercedes-AMG Petronas Formula One team and competes in the America's Cup with sailing team INEOS Britannia.Last year, he failed in a bid to buy Premier League rival Chelsea.ELLIOTT MANAGEMENTAmerican investment firm Elliott Management is an interesting addition to the process, given it has not made a bid for a full takeover.Elliott has, however, bid for a minority stake and is prepared to offer capital or finance to other potential buyers, a person with knowledge of the process said.The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly about the bid.A minority stake or capital investment could provide a way for the Glazers to remain in control, while carrying out necessary development of United's iconic, but ageing, Old Trafford stadium.Elliott took control of AC Milan in 2018, stabilized the storied Italian club's finances and led it to its first league title in 11 years last season.Milan was sold to RedBird Capital Partners for about $1.3 billion last year.___James Robson is at https://twitter.com/jamesalanrobson___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/27,,World

She unexpectedly stepped down last month after eight years as leader of the party and of Scotland’s semi-autonomous government.SNP members chose Yousaf over Scottish finance minister Forbes by a margin of 52% to 48%, after third-placed candidate Ash Regan was eliminated in a first vote. Turnout among the 72,000 members was 70%.Yousaf faces the challenge of uniting the SNP and reenergizing the stalled independence campaign.“Just as I will lead the SNP in the interests of all party members, not just those who voted for me, so I will lead Scotland in the interests of all our citizens whatever your political allegiance,"" he said in an acceptance speech at Edinburgh's Murrayfield rugby stadium.Yousaf paid tribute to his late grandparents, who emigrated from the Punjab to Glasgow more than 60 years ago.“They couldn’t have imagined, in their wildest dreams, that two generations later their grandson would one day be Scotland’s first minister,” he said. “We should all take pride in the fact that today we have sent a clear message: that your color of skin, your faith, is not a barrier to leading the country we all call home.”Yousaf is widely seen as a “continuity Sturgeon” candidate who shares the outgoing leader’s liberal social views.A formidable leader who led the SNP to a dominant position in Scottish politics, Sturgeon failed in her aim of taking Scotland out of the U.K. and divided the party with a contentious transgender rights law.The three candidates to succeed her shared the goal of independence, but differed in their economic and social visions for Scotland.Forbes, 32, is an evangelical Christian who has been criticized for saying that her faith would have prevented her from voting in favor of allowing same-sex couples to wed, had she been a lawmaker when Scotland legalized gay marriage in 2014.Both Forbes and 49-year-old Regan opposed legislation championed by Sturgeon to make it easier for people in Scotland to legally change their gender.The gender recognition bill has been hailed as a landmark piece of legislation by transgender rights activists, but faced opposition from some SNP members who said it ignored the need to protect single-sex spaces for women, such as domestic violence shelters and rape crisis centers.Yousaf has promised to push forward with the bill, which has been passed by the Scottish parliament but blocked by the U.K. government.The SNP holds 64 of the 129 seats in the Scottish parliament and governs in coalition with the much smaller Greens. The smaller party had warned it might quit the coalition if the SNP elected a leader that doesn’t share its progressive views — meaning a victory by Forbes or Regan could have splintered the government.That split has been avoided, but the pro-independence campaign remains adrift. Scottish voters backed remaining in the U.K. in a 2014 referendum that was billed as a once-in-a-generation decision. The SNP wants a new vote, but the central government in London has refused to authorize one, and the U.K. Supreme Court has ruled that Scotland can’t hold one without London’s consent.Yousaf said he would ask the Conservative government in London for authorization to hold a new referendum. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's office said the answer remained no.Yousaf has also said he wants to build a “settled, sustained” majority for independence. Polls currently suggest Scottish voters are split about evenly on the issue.“To those in Scotland who don’t yet share the passion I do for independence, I will aim to earn your trust by continuing to govern well,” Yousaf said.The acrimonious SNP leadership contest has sent the SNP’s poll ratings plunging — to the delight of the Labour Party and the Conservatives, which hope to gain seats in Scotland during the next U.K.-wide election, likely next year.Critics say Yousaf, who served in several posts in Sturgeon’s government, bears some responsibility for Scotland’s long health care waiting times, homelessness problem and high drug death toll.Independent pollster Mark Diffley said that while the SNP members who elected Yousaf are passionately concerned about independence, the new leader “will now have to pivot really quite sharply towards what public priorities are, which is not the same.""“It’s more about supporting people through the cost of living crisis, getting economic growth, improving public services,” Diffley said. ""That’s where reality will bite, I think, pretty soon.”",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848147,Anti-government protests in Kenya hit Nairobi for 2nd week,"Nairobi, Kenya (AP) — Thousands of anti-government protesters marched on the streets of Kenya's capital, Nairobi, on Monday despite the government's declaration that the protests are illegal.Opposition leader Raila Odinga joined protesters on the western side of the capital where his convoy attracted thousands of supporters and he addressed them at various stops calling for electoral justice and reduced prices for food items.Police used a water cannon and teargas to disperse supporters. Police chief Japheth Koome insists that the protests are illegal but Odinga says Kenyans have a right to demonstrate.Odinga and his party, Azimio la Umoja–One Kenya Coalition, are leading the protests against the rising cost of living and calling for President William Ruto's resignation saying he wasn't validly elected in last year's election.The protests occurred last week and Odinga has urged his followers to take to the streets twice a week, on Mondays and Thursdays.More than a dozen civil society groups have in a joint statement expressed concern over police declaring Monday's protests illegal and urged authorities to uphold people's constitutional right to peaceful demonstrations.Ruto over the weekend urged Odinga to face him directly and “stop terrorizing the country.”Odinga’s plan in last week’s protests was to march to the president’s offices at State House but police erected barriers to prevent public access and motorists were directed to alternative routes.Ruto is currently out of the country visiting Germany.Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua shared photos of himself at his office early Monday morning and urged Kenyans to report to work.Nairobi's central business district remained calm but most businesses were closed on Monday morning due to the uncertainty over demonstrations and if there would be violence.There were reports of some violence directed at Odinga and his supporters. Some people raided a farm in the outskirts of the capital owned by the family of the former president Uhuru Kenyatta, cutting trees and taking away sheep, according to local media reports. The former president supported Odinga in 2022 elections.Odinga's gas cylinder manufacturing business near the central business district was pelted with stones.There was a heavy police presence within the capital and surrounding neighborhoods on Monday. Police have dispersed crowds that gathered in Kibera and Mathare, poor areas of Nairobi.A resident on Kibera, Emily Atieno, told the Associated Press she would continue to protest until the “price of cooking flour is reduced”. Another protester Mario Omari said protests would continue until Ruto resigns from office.Local media have been warned against broadcasting Monday’s protests. The Communication Authority of Kenya said the airing of last week’s demonstrations caused panic, incited the public and threatened peace.The High Court, however, ruled that the authority’s notice was unconstitutional and upheld media freedom in response to a petition filed by a civil society group, a journalists’ union and the Law Society.In 2018, Kenya's main television stations were taken off air for one week by the regulator after airing Odinga’s “mock” swearing in ceremony where he claimed to be the people’s president.” Odinga had rejected the 2017 election results and organized anti-government protests.Police last week threatened to take action against those pictured hurling stones at officers.They released photos of people who they said were wanted for crimes committed during the protests but were called out by local media outlets for using old photos and others that were taken during protests in Burundi.",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848148,Opposition disrupts Indian Parliament after Gandhi's ouster,"NEW DELHI (AP) — Members of opposition parties dressed in black disrupted India's Parliament on Monday and protested in the capital, New Delhi, after Rahul Gandhi, a key opposition leader and fierce critic of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, was expelled from the legislature last week.Hundreds of supporters of Gandhi's Congress party demonstrated in the heart of New Delhi and dozens were detained by police. Lawmakers from 18 opposition parties also protested together outside Parliament, donning black clothes to symbolize mourning and waving posters that warned India's democracy is in danger.Gandhi's expulsion on Friday came a day after a local court convicted him of defamation and sentenced him to two years in prison for mocking Modi's surname in an election speech in 2019. The actions against Gandhi, the great-grandson of India's first prime minister, were widely denounced by opponents of Modi as assaults against democracy and free speech by a government seeking to quash dissent. His removal from Parliament also delivered a major blow to the Congress party ahead of national elections next year.“The government wants to suppress the opposition and their voice,” said Mallikarjun Kharge, president of the Congress party.Over the weekend, Gandhi said he is being targeted for raising questions about Modi's relationship to Gautam Adani, a coal tycoon who until recently was Asia's richest man.Hindenburg Research, a U.S. financial research firm, accused the Adani Group in January of stock price manipulation and fraud running into billions of dollars. Since then, Gandhi has pushed for an investigation into Adani's sprawling businesses, whose market value has since plummeted by tens of billions of dollars. Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party says he has no links to Adani.The protesting opposition lawmakers backed Gandhi on Monday by renewing calls for a parliamentary probe into the Adani Group.Gandhi said he was not bothered about losing his seat in Parliament. “My job is to defend the institutions of the country and the voice of people,” he said over the weekend.A court in Modi’s home state of Gujarat convicted Gandhi last week over a 2019 speech in which he asked, “Why do all thieves have Modi as their surname?” Gandhi then referred to three well-known and unrelated Modis: a fugitive Indian diamond tycoon, a cricket executive banned from the Indian Premier League tournament and the prime minister.Under Indian law, a criminal conviction and prison sentence of two years or more are grounds for expulsion from Parliament. Gandhi was granted bail for 30 days to allow him to appeal the decision, which Gandhi says he will do.",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848149,UN expert advising IOC gives views on Russians at Olympics,"GENEVA (AP) — Russian athletes who have actively served in the military invasion of Ukraine should be allowed to return to international sports if they did not take part in war crimes, according to a United Nations expert advising the International Olympic Committee.The U.N. special rapporteur for cultural rights, Alexandra Xanthaki, said late Sunday only Russian military members implicated in “allegations of war crimes, genocide, crimes against humanity or propaganda for war” should be denied neutral status to compete in international sports ahead of the 2024 Paris Olympics.Xanthaki angered Ukrainian athletes who took part in an IOC-hosted call to consult them ahead of an Olympic announcement due Tuesday to update guidance for sports bodies 16 months before the opening of the Paris Games.Ukrainian government and sports officials want the IOC to ban all Russians from the 2024 Games and claim most of the country’s recent Olympic medalists were affiliated with the military.Xanthaki wrote on her official Twitter account Sunday her view that “an athlete who has participated in war would be included” for neutral status to compete in sports without national symbols such as flags and anthems.The Greek lawyer later clarified it was usual that “men all around the world are conscripted to take part in wars” and have to follow orders, including killing. She also referred to “illegal aggressive” conflicts in Syria, Afghanistan, Israel and Iraq.“We cannot hold all men who participate in illegal wars by their states following orders responsible. Those who perform crimes, we must,” Xanthaki wrote.It is unclear how far the IOC will follow her advice ahead of its executive board meeting Tuesday. It is due to discuss “solidarity with Ukraine, the sanctions against Russia and Belarus, and the status of athletes from these countries.”The IOC’s initial advice to sports bodies within days of the war starting last February was to exclude athletes from Russia and ally Belarus. It cited Russia’s “extremely grave violation” of the Olympic Truce in place for the 2022 Winter Games in Beijing, plus the integrity and security of sports events.Since January, the IOC has pushed for finding a path to reintegrate Russians and Belarusians into world sports. It pointed to advice from Xanthaki and another U.N. expert that excluding athletes based only on their passport would be discrimination that breached their human rights.Xanthaki on Friday briefed members of official athlete panels from most national Olympic bodies, including Ukraine, in a two-hour call hosted by the IOC.The Ukrainians “ferociously disagreed with my analysis,” she acknowledged in a Twitter exchange, adding that athletes taking part from countries in the Global South agreed with her.“It makes no sense in terms of sport,” Ukrainian skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych, a two-time Olympian, told The Associated Press on Monday about Xanthaki’s views on the call and the difficulty of proving an athlete’s links to war crimes.“Do we have to make a documentary about how he makes a crime?” said Heraskevych, who drew attention at last year's Beijing Games by holding up a “No War in Ukraine” sign after his race.The IOC was talking Monday with representatives of Olympic sports bodies who will decide for themselves on conditions for letting athletes compete in their upcoming events, and define neutrality.A strong position against the IOC was taken last week by track and field’s World Athletics, which is refusing to admit any Russians or Belarusians “for the foreseeable future.”Final decisions on Russian athletes competing at the Paris Games still rest with the IOC. In the Olympic Charter, article 44.3 states: “Nobody is entitled as of right to participate in the Olympic Games.”___More AP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/27,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848150,More than 180 Rohingya refugees arrive on Indonesian beach,"LHOKSEUMAWE, Indonesia (AP) — More than 180 disoriented Rohingya Muslims, some of whom needed medical attention, arrived in the early morning in Indonesia’s northernmost province of Aceh, an official said Monday.“From the information we received, the boat took them and told them that they have arrived at their destination and left them at the beach,” said Andy Rahmansyah, East Aceh police chief.He said the authorities are still collecting more information and giving medical aid to some of the refugees.Ali Hussein, one of the refugees, said the boat took them from Bangladesh before it fled and left them in the dark after the group disembarked to the beach.“It was difficult there. When we were gathered, we got offered a rate for the boat and we agreed to go to a far place, whether it is Indonesia or Malaysia,” Hussein said.The group of 184, including women and children, arrived by fishing boat at Kuala Matang Peulawi, a coastal area in Peureulak subdistrict in East Aceh.More than 700,000 Rohingya Muslims fled from Buddhist-majority Myanmar to refugee camps in Bangladesh after an army-led crackdown in August 2017. Myanmar security forces have been accused of mass rapes, killings and the burning of thousands of Rohingya homes.Most of the refugees who left the camps by sea have attempted to reach Muslim-majority Malaysia, but many have ended up in Indonesia along the way.More than 500 Rohingya landed in Aceh in 2022. The most recent group was in February, when 71 people landed at a beach in Aceh Besar district. In early January, 184 weak and hungry Rohingya refugees landed on Kuala Gigieng beach, also in Aceh Besar district.___Associated Press writer Edna Tarigan in Jakarta, Indonesia, contributed to this report.",2023/03/27,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848151,Greenland to stay in daylight saving time forever,"COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — Residents of Greenland have switched to daylight saving time and moved their clocks one hour forward this weekend for the very last time.Unlike most of Europe, Greenlanders will leave their clocks untouched come autumn when daylight saving time ends. While Europe and the U.S. debates whether to stick to the twice-yearly practice, Greenland - a vast Danish semi-independent territory in the Arctic - has resolved to perennially remain only three hours behind Copenhagen and most other European countries instead of four.Greenland's parliament, Inatsisartut, voted to stick to daylight saving time year-round on Nov. 24 last year. Officials say it will give Greenlanders another hour of daylight in the afternoons and more time to do business with Europe and farther afield.“The shift of time zone marks an exciting new beginning, an equal connection to North America and Europe, and an opportunity to slow down in a fast-paced world,” Visit Greenland, the local government's tourism office said in a statement.Geographically, sparsely populated Greenland belongs to the North American continent but geopolitically, it is in Europe.Greenland is part the Danish Realm and its southernmost tip is more than 3,200 kilometers (nearly 2,000 miles) west of Copenhagen.Its 56,000 people mainly Inuit, indigenous people who chiefly live on the west coast in small towns and hamlets or remote coastal settlements.",2023/03/27,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848152,Elizabeth Warren running for 3rd US Senate term in 2024,"BOSTON (AP) — Massachusetts Democratic U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren announced Monday that she will seek a third term in 2024.Warren, a prominent voice for the liberal wing of the Democratic Party and a failed 2020 presidential contender, said she's running for reelection to end corruption in Washington, make the economy work for the middle class and protect democracy.“I first ran for Senate because I saw how the system is rigged for the rich and powerful and against everyone else. I won because Massachusetts voters know it, too. And now I’m running for Senate again because there’s a lot more we’ve got to do,” Warren said in a campaign video released Monday.Warren, 73, had more than $2.3 million in her campaign account at the end of 2022, according to reports filed with the Federal Election Commission.Warren first won election to the seat in 2012, defeating incumbent Republican U.S. Sen. Scott Brown, who was elected to fill out the term of Democratic U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy, who died in 2009.With the win, the then-Harvard Law School professor became the first woman elected to the U.S. Senate from Massachusetts.In 2018, Warren won a second term, easily defeating Republican candidate Geoff Diehl, before quickly setting her sights on the presidency.While popular among some Democratic voters for her blunt rhetoric, Warren was unable to break away from the party's pack of contenders and dropped out after failing to win any of the states that voted on Super Tuesday, including coming in third in the Democratic primary in her home state.During the campaign against Brown and again during her bid for the presidency, Warren was dogged by past claims of Native American heritage and her inability to provide documentation of that ancestry.That led then-President Donald Trump to go after her early in the presidential campaign, derisively labeling her “Pocahontas."" Warren had said she learned of her family ties to Cherokee and Delaware tribes from stories told by her parents.After the 2020 loss, Warren continued her focus on the financial sector.Warren recently joined California Rep. Katie Porter, a Democrat, to push a proposal to repeal a 2018 rollback of certain aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act, enacted after the financial crisis a decade earlier.The bill, part of discussions in Congress following the recent abrupt failure of two banks, is unlikely to advance.In her campaign video, Warren ticked off a series of priorities from passing a wealth tax and putting stricter rules on banks to making child care more affordable, protecting coastal communities and building what she called “a 21st century transportation system across all of Massachusetts.""It's unclear who might challenge Warren for the Senate seat. Many Democrats appeared to be waiting until Warren or fellow Massachusetts U.S. Sen. Edward Markey, also a Democrat, decided not to seek reelection. Markey in 2020 fended off a primary challenge from then-Democratic U.S. Rep. Joe Kennedy.The state's Republican Party is trying to rebuild after losing the governor's office last year when Republican Gov. Charlie Baker opted not to seek a third term and Democrat Maura Healey handily defeated GOP candidate Geoff Diehl.Warren already has the backing of many high-profile Massachusetts Democrats including U.S. Rep. Ayanna Pressley, Boston Mayor Michelle Wu and Markey.Warren serves on several congressional committees including the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, the Committee on Finance and the Committee on Armed Services.",2023/03/27,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848237,India: Parliament adjourned amid pro-Rahul Gandhi protest,"The Indian parliament on Monday was adjourned as opposition lawmakers protested the expulsion of opposition leader Rahul Gandhi.Gandhi, former president of the Congress party, was stripped of his parliamentary seat on Friday.This came a day after he was convicted in a defamation case and sentenced to two years in prison in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's home state of Gujarat. He was immediately granted bail.Critics say that his dismissal from parliament heightens concerns about the creeping authoritarianism in the world's largest democracy.Opposition lawmakers held a meeting led by Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge in the parliament building on Monday morning, according to the Economic Times newspaper.Multiple opposition parties from across the country participated in the meeting.When the parliamentary session opened, the Congress leaders entered wearing black shirts and scarves.Some of them tore paper and hurled it at Om Birla, the speaker of the lower house, the Indian Express reported.""I want to run the House with dignity,"" said Birla before adjourning the session until 4 p.m. local time.Ahead of the parliamentary session on Monday, Congress parliamentarian Pramod Tiwari told news agency ANI that the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) ""time is up.""After Gandhi's expulsion, several opposition parties held a protest march in the capital city of New Delhi on Friday.They alleged that ""democracy is in danger"" and pushed the government to investigate the allegations against India's most powerful business tycoon Gautam Adani.Adani has been under scrutiny after US-based investment short-selling firm Hindenburg Research recently released a scathing report outlining allegations of accounting fraud and market manipulation at Adani Group.For over a month, Congress has been pointing out Prime Minister Narendra Modi's close relationship with Adani and demanded an investigation into the industrialist.""I have been disqualified because the prime minister… is scared of the next speech that is going to come on Adani. I will continue to ask the question – what is the prime minister's relationship with Mr Adani?"" asked Rahul Gandhi at a press conference on Saturday.Rahul Gandhi was sentenced for a comment he made in 2019, when he asked why ""all thieves have Modi as [their] common surname.""His remarks were seen as a dig against Modi who has won two elections since then.Members of the government filed a criminal defamation case against Gandhi, alleging that his words were insulting.The Congress leader faces several other defamation cases and a money-laundering case that has been snaking its way through India's glacial legal system for more than a decade.Edited by: Farah Bahgat",2023/03/27,,

Myanmar's military leaders are known to be highly superstitious.In the Sagaing region in the northwest, a stronghold of armed resistance, people also held small protests against the junta on the pubic holiday.zc/fb (AFP, AP)",2023/03/27,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848240,Taiwan's former leader Ma sets off on China tour,"Former Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou began his 12-day visit to mainland China on Monday, departing from the Taoyuan International Airport near Taipei and heading to his first stop — the Chinese city of Shanghai.Ma, who is bringing a cohort of Taiwanese students with him as part of an exchange with two Chinese universities, is visiting as a private citizen.However, his role as the former head of the democratic, self-governing island carries political weight. He has framed the trip as a means to improve relations between Beijing and Taipei.""I hope through the enthusiasm of the youth and their interactions to improve the cross-strait mood, so bring peace faster, and earlier,"" he told reporters before setting off.Ma's visit comes a day after Honduras — one of the 14 countries to formally recognize Taiwan — broke its ties with the island.Ma is a member of the opposition Nationalist Party (Kuomingtang) and held the presidential office between 2008 and 2016. He met with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Singapore in 2015, shortly before rival Tsai Ing-wen won the presidency.The Kuomingtang had maintained closer cross-strait relations than Tsai's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) who have angered Beijing through their insistence on Taiwan's independence and sovereignty.Beijing considers Taiwan a renegade province and has pledged to take back control of the island.However, Monday marks former President Ma's first visit to the mainland. He will also be taking part in the traditional Tomb Sweeping Day on April 5 when families visit the graves of their ancestors.Ma will visit several cities — not including Beijing — and may meet with Chinese officials. The delegation of students traveling with him are set to meet with their counterparts from Shanghai's Fudan University and Changsha's Hunan University.The DPP has criticized Ma's travel plans, but there has been little in terms of controversy on the island due to other Kuomingtang politicians having previously made similar trips.Groups gathered at the airport to see off Ma, with some protesting his actions while others were expressing support.A former student leader from the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests urged Ma to cancel the visit.""If you have even a strand of affection for Taiwan ... you should announce the cancellation of your trip,"" Wang Dan wrote on his Facebook page.Tensions between China and Taiwan have been heightened since the DPP took power. Beijing cut off contact and has been carrying out military maneuvers in the proximity of the island.ab/fb (AP, Reuters)",2023/03/27,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848247,Retegui a bright note as Azzurri again fail to shine,"MILAN (AP) — Mateo Retegui’s impressive debut for Italy added some gloss to what was essentially a mediocre performance from the defending champion at the start of European Championship qualifying.Less than two years after beating England on penalties to win Euro 2020, Italy kicked off its campaign to reach Euro 2024 with a 2-1 loss at home to the same opponent on Thursday.The Azzurri followed that up with a 2-0 win over Malta on Sunday but there is much to improve.“We could have and should have done better. In what? Almost everything,” Italy coach Roberto Mancini said. “We did some things right, and other things less so. It was important to win, but we should have scored more goals.”The first qualifiers for Euro 2024 took place just over three months after the World Cup, which Italy again didn’t qualify for.After Italy failed to reach the 2018 World Cup, the Azzurri stormed through qualification for Euro 2020. They won all 10 of their matches, scoring 37 goals and conceding just four.Mancini’s team then went on to win the tournament and Italy’s revival appeared to be complete.But the Azzurri’s recent performances have raised doubts about whether Italy’s triumph was indeed a return to the top or an anomaly driven by the passion and fervor of a country recovering from being one of the hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic. Italians dominated the sporting successes that year.Italy has won just eight of its 20 matches since lifting the European Championship trophy. Thursday’s loss to England was its first in European Championship qualifying since 2006 and the first time it had lost the opener in nearly 50 years.The one bright note for Mancini and Italy against England was that Retegui scored on his international debut. The Argentina-born forward, who has Italian citizenship through his maternal grandmother, followed that up by netting Italy’s opener at Malta.“He broke the deadlock, which was crucial, but he still needs time and to get to know European football,” Mancini said.The 23-year-old Retegui has spent his entire career so far in Argentina, where he plays for Tigre on loan from Boca Juniors. He was the top scorer in the domestic league last season with 19 goals and also tops the current standings, having netted six times in eight matches.“He’s a goalscorer, we saw that during the period we were following him,” Mancini said. “Of course he has to settle in, he has to fit into certain ways, but he scores goals and that’s an important characteristic for a center forward.“He has the qualities but we have to give him time. He’s like a student in a new school.”Retegui has already been courted by Italian clubs, with Inter Milan reportedly at the head of the queue.The Nerazzurri have the added bonus that they have another Argentina-born player with an Italian passport on its books, Facundo Colidio. Moreover, he is on loan at Tigre.“It would be a good thing if Retegui came to Serie A,” Mancini said. “I think it would give him more strength, he would manage to learn the language and consequently communicate better with his teammates.”___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/27,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848248,Another Pakistan court protects ex-PM Imran Khan from arrest,"ISLAMABAD (AP) — Another Pakistani court on Monday ruled in defense of former Prime Minister Imran Khan, granting him protection from arrest as lawsuits mounted against him. Police have charged the ousted premier with incitement to violence in several cases when his followers clashed with security forces this month.The latest reprieve for Khan comes as a political crisis roils Pakistan, pitting the former cricket star turned Islamist politician against the government of his successor, Shahbaz Sharif, and spilling into violence in the streets.Khan was ousted through a no-confidence vote in Parliament last April. Since then, the 70-year-old opposition leader has had more than 100 legal cases filed against him, including on charges of terrorism, incitement to violence and graft while in office.He has unsuccessfully campaigned for early elections, and has claimed, without providing evidence, that there are numerous plots to assassinate him.The Islamabad High Court on Monday ruled that Khan cannot be arrested — at least for another week — in seven separate cases over March 18 clashes between his followers and police outside a court in the Pakistani capital where Khan was to appear on graft charges.Khan's supporters hurled stones at the officers and scuffled with police, who fired tear gas and beat the crowd with batons. Islamabad police have since then arrested nearly 400 Khan supporters over that and other incidents.As Khan arrived for the hearing and walked into the Islamabad court earlier on Monday under tight security, his bodyguards held up bulletproof shields around him for protection. Police also detained Khan's personal photographer at the scene and several Khan followers.Footage distributed on social media shows police dragging, pushing and shoving detained Khan followers into a police truck parked near the court. In their crackdown on Khan's supporters, police last week also detained Azhar Mashwani, the head of Khan's social media team, and others.Monday's ruling echoed those of a court in the eastern city of Lahore which recently granted multiple bails to the former prime minister. Under Pakistani law, such court decisions shield a suspect from arrest.Khan has mostly avoided court appearances since last November, when he was wounded in a gun attack at a protest rally in the eastern Punjab province. One of his supporters was killed and 13 were wounded in that attack.",2023/03/27,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848249,Alibaba's Jack Ma returns to mainland China,"HONG KONG (AP) — Alibaba founder Jack Ma has resurfaced in China after months of overseas travel, visiting a school Monday in the city where his company is headquartered and discussed topics such as artificial intelligence.Ma founded e-commerce firm Alibaba in the 1990s and was once China’s richest man. He has kept a low profile with few public appearances since Nov. 2020, when he had publicly criticized China's regulators and financial systems during a speech in Shanghai.Shortly afterward, authorities put the brakes on the initial public offering of Alibaba’s financial affiliate Ant Group, which had been set to raise $34.5 billion in what would have been the world’s largest share offering at the time. Alibaba was later investigated and fined $2.8 billion for breaching antitrust rules as Chinese authorities cracked down on the once-freewheeling technology industry.In the past year, Ma has been travelling, with reports of sightings in Europe, Japan, Thailand and Hong Kong. His itinerary has been closely watched as a barometer of Beijing’s attitude towards private businesses.On Monday, Ma visited the Yungu School in Hangzhou, in eastern China, that was established by Ma and other partners of Alibaba, according to a WeChat post by the school. Ma discussed technologies such as the artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT, and spoke of his passion for learning.Alibaba did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Chinese government has been seeking to raise confidence in the private sector after regulatory crackdowns, on technology, education, online gaming and financial companies, and harsh COVID-19 restrictions slowed the economy.Earlier this month, China’s newly-appointed premier, Li Qiang, sought to reassure entrepreneurs and investors by saying the government would provide “unswerving” support for the private sector. The commitment to this was “unequivocal and steadfast,” he said.Ma stepped down as Alibaba chairman in 2019, saying he hoped to focus on philanthropy. In January, he ceded control of Ant, the financial technology firm, amid a revamp of its shareholding structure.The same month, a top Chinese central bank official said that the c rackdown on the internet industry was “basically” over.",2023/03/27,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848283,"Zelenskyy, atomic agency chief discuss nuclear plant fears","ZAPORIZHZHIA, Ukraine (AP) — The U.N.'s atomic energy chief warned during a meeting Monday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that the perilous situation at Europe’s largest nuclear plant “isn’t getting any better” as relentless fighting in the area keeps the facility at risk of a disaster.The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant's six reactors are in shutdown and it is receiving the electricity it needs to prevent a reactor meltdown through just one remaining power line. It has on occasion had to switch to emergency diesel generators to power its essential cooling systems.In a meeting with Zelenskyy in southern Ukraine covered exclusively by The Associated Press, International Atomic Energy Agency Director-General Rafael Mariano Grossi said the situation at the plant remains tense because of the heavy military presence around it and a blackout that recently struck the facility, something that has occurred repeatedly since Russian forces took it over last year.Grossi plans to visit the plant this week for the second time following Russia’s invasion 13 months ago. The Vienna-based agency has staff permanently deployed at the plant since Grossi's last visit in September.Earlier this month, fighting interrupted power supply to the plant for half a day, forcing staff to activate backup generators.Grossi had expressed alarm at that development.“Each time we are rolling a dice,” he told his agency at the time. “And if we allow this to continue time after time, then one day our luck will run out.”Grossi and Zelenskyy met in the the city of Zaporizhzhia, which is in Ukrainian-held territory, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) northeast of the nuclear plant with the same name.The IAEA said in January it was placing teams of experts at all four of Ukraine’s nuclear power plants to reduce the risk of accidents, including the now-closed Chernobyl plant whose deadly nuclear accident in 1986 spread fallout over much of Europe.Grossi emphasized that his seventh trip to Ukraine underlined his commitment and support for “as long as it takes.”Also attending the meeting were other IAEA officials, the head of the presidential office, Andriy Yermak, and the head of nuclear operator Energoatom, Petro Kotin.While in Zaporizhzhia, Zelenskyy also inspected military positions in the partially-occupied province and awarded soldiers military honors. He visited wounded soldiers at a hospital and an apartment building that Kyiv claims was hit by a missile on Wednesday, killing at least one person and injuring more than 30.Residents were still shocked by the experience.“It’s terrifying. I cannot find the words to tell you,” said Hanna Budkova, 39, who was in a busy playground in front of the apartment block with her nearly 2-year-old daughter. “I’m afraid to go anywhere near the windows.”Zelenskyy later visited Nikopol, a frequently shelled city across the Dnieper River from the nuclear power plant, according to the presidential office.Elsewhere, two people were killed and 29 wounded Monday when Russian forces shelled the city of Sloviansk, in the partially occupied eastern Donetsk region, officials said.Video footage of the aftermath showed damaged residential buildings, debris in the streets and vehicles on fire. Zelenskyy described the attack as “terrorism.”Russia has denied targeting residential areas even though artillery and rocket strikes have hit Ukrainian apartment buildings and civilian infrastructure daily during the war.The Sloviansk attack followed a typical pattern of long-range shelling adopted by the Kremlin's forces, especially in recent months as the fighting became deadlocked during the winter.In the eastern Donetsk region, about 10 cities and villages were shelled by Russian forces over the previous 24 hours, Ukraine’s presidential office reported.Russian missiles hit the city of Avdiivka, damaging residential buildings, a hotel and a courthouse, it said.Avdiivka Mayor Vitali Barabash said utility companies are being evacuated from the front-line city, as it “resembles more and more a landscape from post-apocalyptic movies.”Attacks also intensified in the Zaporizhzhia region, where 14 settlements on the front line were shelled, authorities said.In the partially occupied Kherson region, the Ukrainian-controlled part of the province was bombarded 20 times, wounding four people, the presidential office said.Several explosions shook the Russia-occupied city of Melitopol in the Zaporizhzhia region, damaging a building where Russian security forces are quartered, said the exiled elected mayor Ivan Fyodorov. The Russian-installed authorities said “artillery shelling” of Melitopol partially destroyed a vocational school building, damaged several other buildings and wounded four people.Earlier, Zelenskyy met in Kyiv with British actor Orlando Bloom, according Yermak, the head of the presidential office. Bloom, a UNICEF goodwill ambassador, arrived over the weekend and visited its suburb of Irpin.At his meeting with Zelenskyy, Bloom said “he was struck by the courage and resilience of Ukrainians, who despite the war remain strong,” Yermak wrote.Bloom “will support projects to provide humanitarian assistance and restore infrastructure, focused on ensuring the interests of Ukrainian children,” the official said.German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Monday at a meeting in the Netherlands that Germany has fulfilled its promised delivery of 18 advanced Leopard 2 battle tanks to Ukraine. Canada, Norway and Poland also have sent such tanks to Ukraine.___This has corrected that the Zaporizhzhia plant is not currently providing power.___Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine: https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",2023/03/28,,World

But Kyoto University has its own tradition of students who opt for different attire on their special day.This year, Zelenskyy was the star at the event.“I am President Zelenskyy,” the student told local TV network Yomiuri. He said it took him three months to grow his beard. He decided to be his lookalike for the graduation ceremony Friday, because “since December, when I was growing out my beard, I was told I look like President Zelenskyy.”His performance was not just a comical cosplay. The student, who goes by Amiki on Twitter, was holding a sign carrying messages expressing his support for Ukraine, along with a passage from Zelenskyy’s speech in December at the U.S. Congress.In the video from TV Osaka, he said he respects Zelenskyy as “the real man among men.”“We stand for Ukraine! Justice will prevail in the end, I hope so. Glory to Ukraine,” he tweeted.The student also held a wooden shamoji — a rice serving spoon — like the one that Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida presented to Zelenskyy as a gift during his secret trip to Kyiv last week. The rice paddle is a specialty of Hiroshima, where Kishida is from, and bears a prayer for victory, but was bitterly criticized by opposition lawmakers as “nonsense.”Giving a rice serving spoon to the leader of a country at war didn't seem appropriate, the student said. “Nonetheless, I’m happy if the Ukrainian people were pleased and the traditional prayer behind it was conveyed.”Ukrainian Ambassador Sergiy Korsunsky retweeted a scene from the video of the Zelenskyy lookalike, as well as the student's tweets showing solidarity for Ukraine.",2023/03/27,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848285,New Maryland provider opening in post-Roe 'abortion desert',"CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) — A new abortion provider is opening this year in Democratic-controlled Maryland — just across from deeply conservative West Virginia, where state lawmakers recently passed a near-total abortion ban.The Women’s Health Center of Maryland in Cumberland, roughly 5 miles (8 kilometers) from West Virginia, will open its doors in June — a year after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned federal abortion protections — to provide abortions to patients across central Appalachia, a region clinic operators say is an “abortion desert.”“Hours in any direction, there are no other abortion providers here — it’s smack dab in the middle of an absolute abortion desert, and that's by design,"" said Katie Quiñonez, executive director of the Charleston-based Women’s Health Center of West Virginia, the state's lone abortion clinic until it was forced to stop the procedures after legislators in September passed a ban with narrow exemptions.The Cumberland clinic will be the only independent reproductive health care center in the area and the western-most provider of surgical and medical abortion and gender-affirming hormone therapy in Maryland. Quiñonez, who will also serve as the Maryland clinic’s executive director, said the facility will be a more accessible option for patients in northern West Virginia, western Maryland, south central Pennsylvania and Ohio, where an abortion ban is under injunction.Independent abortion clinics provide most abortions in the U.S. — especially for people with low-incomes who live in isolated, rural states hostile to abortion access. The clinics are more likely to offer abortion after the first trimester and to provide both surgical and medication abortion options, according to the Abortion Care Network, the national association for independent abortion care providers.Dozens of independent clinics across the country have been forced to close their doors since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, and in 14 states, there are no abortion clinics at all.At least 66 clinics in 15 states have stopped providing abortions since the decision, according the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights. The number of clinics providing abortions in those 15 states dropped from 79 to 13 by October of last year, with the remaining clinics in Georgia.When West Virginia lawmakers passed their sweeping abortion ban, several members of the Republican majority said they hoped it would force the Women’s Health Center of West Virginia to shut down. Republican Sen. Robert Karnes said he believed shuttering the center was “going to save a lot of babies."" Brandon Steele, a Republican in the state's House of Delegates, called abortion access “a scar” and ""a curse"" lawmakers had to “remove from this land.”West Virginia patients seeking an abortion now have to take time off work, travel hundreds of miles and pay for lodging and other accommodations, “all to get basic health care,” Quiñonez said.“Our communities deserve better — people should be able to access abortion care without delay or barriers,” she said.The Women's Health Center of Maryland will provide abortion services into the second trimester and will accept Maryland Medicaid, which covers abortion. It will also offer annual exams, contraception, testing and treatment for sexually-transmitted diseases, as well as breast and cervical cancer screenings.Although no abortions can be provided there, West Virginia’s clinic is still open and offers other reproductive health care and hard-to-find services, like gender-affirming hormone therapy. But Quiñonez said they still get calls from anxious patients who don't know where to go for an abortion. Until the Maryland clinic opens and can take referrals, her staff has no other option but to send callers to a website to find out-of-state services.Since January 2022, the clinic's abortion fund has distributed $150,000 for more than 800 people, mostly West Virginia residents.Maryland has a Democratic governor and a Democratic-controlled General Assembly that has shown commitment to preserving abortion access. Abortion is legal in Maryland until about 24 weeks into pregnancy.The nearest independent reproductive health clinic to Cumberland that provides abortion and gender-affirming hormone therapy is a Planned Parenthood 90 miles (145 kilometers) away in Frederick. That facility provides medication abortion only.A closer clinic in Hagerstown is open for abortions during limited hours a few times a month. It provides first-trimester abortions only and doesn’t accept Maryland Medicaid — a barrier to low-income patients, Quiñonez said. Otherwise, patients must travel more than 100 miles (161 kilometers) to Pittsburgh or even further, to Baltimore or Washington, D.C.Renovations started last week on the Cumberland clinic — crews were installing new medical equipment and signage, deep cleaning, applying fresh paint, replacing floors and patching drywall.The cost for the facility, licensing and renovations is roughly $1.17 million. First-year operating costs — to include payroll, building operations — are projected to be around $763,000. Both the West Virginia and Maryland clinics are funded by donations, foundations and organizations in support of expanding abortion access in the U.S.The Women’s Health Center of Maryland will have its own finances and, eventually, state-based board of directors. The Women's Health Center of West Virginia's directors will act as the board while the organization recruits new, locally-based members.“Folks have always needed abortions — since the beginning of time,"" Quiñonez said. “And they will always need abortions until the end of time. We are going to keep fighting to get every patient the care they need.”",2023/03/27,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848286,Juventus lawyers appear in court for false accounting trial,"TURIN, Italy (AP) — Juventus’ lawyers appeared before a judge Monday to face the first in a series of court dates following accusations of false accounting by the 36-time Italian champions.The judge for a preliminary hearing in a Turin court postponed the procedure until May 10 for administrative reasons.Juventus, former club president Andrea Agnelli and 11 others face charges of false communications by a company listed publicly on the Milan stock exchange, obstructing watchdog agencies, false billing and market manipulation.“It’s completely normal in terms of procedure,” Juventus lawyer Maurizio Bellacosa said following the postponement, adding that the club will request that the trial be moved to Milan or Rome upon its resumption in May.Juventus’ entire board of directors resigned in November after news emerged of the widespread investigation by Turin prosecutors.The club was then hit with a 15-point penalty in Serie A in January after a sports trial in the case was re-opened based on information from the Turin prosecutors.Juventus, which denies wrongdoing, has appealed the 15-point penalty to Italy’s highest sports court within the Italian Olympic Committee, known as CONI. An appeal hearing at CONI is slated for April 19.If the point penalty is reduced, it could boost Juventus back into the Champions League places. The team is currently in seventh place but would be in second place if the entire penalty was scrapped.UEFA has also requested documentation from the Turin prosecutors.One of the Turin prosecutors, Ciro Santoriello, withdrew himself from the case after a video emerged of him professing to be a fan of Juventus rival Napoli and to “hate” Juventus.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/27,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848287,Wanted: A manager to end Tottenham's long trophy drought,"There’s the romanticism of a return for Mauricio Pochettino. The intrigue of the possible arrival of Julian Nagelsmann. Maybe even an audacious attempt to lure the Premier League’s “Next Big Thing” — Roberto De Zerbi.For now, though, Tottenham — in a state of flux after the departure of Antonio Conte — will be led until the end of the season, at least, by Cristian Stellini, a long-time No. 2 now going it alone for what is set to be a demanding couple of months as the team looks to secure Champions League qualification.Most soccer fans knew all about Conte, the serial winner — at least before he arrived at Tottenham — known to eventually combust, pretty much as he did a week ago in a rant that marked the beginning of the end of his time in north London.Fewer will have heard of Stellini, who has been Conte’s assistant for much of the past 13 years and has a soccer background just as interesting as the man he has loyally served until now.The 48-year-old Stellini has been thrust into the limelight intermittently in recent months while leading Tottenham for certain matches in place of Conte, who had to step away briefly because of either suspension or for health reasons. He has done a good job, too, notably gaining wins at Marseille in November to secure advancement in the Champions League and against both Manchester City and Chelsea in the Premier League in February.Still, Stellini is very much Conte’s man, which makes it all the more unexpected that he is still at Tottenham following the latest managerial change at a club without a major trophy since 2008.Aside from an underwhelming stint in his native Italy with Alessandria in 2017 — he lasted 142 days at the third-division team — he has always been an assistant at senior level, ever since retiring as a player in 2010.He was the No. 2 to Conte at Siena in 2010-11, with the club earning promotion to Serie A, and then at Juventus for a little over a year. Then came a dark period for Stellini when he was handed a 2½-year ban in 2012 by the Italian Football Federation following an investigation into alleged match-fixing — accusations he denied — stemming from his time at Bari as a player in 2008-09.He returned in 2015 as a youth coach at Genoa and was eventually reunited with Conte in 2019 at Inter Milan, again taking up the role as assistant coach. They moved together to Tottenham in 2021.Stellini stayed with Conte's tried-and-tested 3-4-3 formation during his games in charge at Tottenham and there's no sign he prefers a different tactic, especially given the players he has at his disposal. Pedro Porro, a January signing, and offseason recruit Ivan Perisic were brought in especially to be wing backs, for example.He takes the helm with Tottenham occupying the fourth and final Champions League qualification spot, but under real threat by the teams below. Fifth-place Newcastle is two points back and has two games in hand while sixth-place Liverpool and seventh-place Brighton are seven points adrift having played two and three fewer games, respectively.Tottenham's recent form has been concerning, too, with the team having won just one of its last five games in all competitions. In the space of a week at the start of March, Tottenham lost to second-tier Sheffield United in the FA Cup's last 16 and was eliminated from the Champions League at the same stage.Stellini has to shore things up for the Premier League's final stretch, starting for Tottenham with a match at Everton on April 3.In the meantime, the club's board will begin the search for a fourth permanent manager since Pochettino left in 2019. Here are some of the potential options:MAURICIO POCHETTINOPochettino was fired by Tottenham when the team's fortunes declined following its remarkable rise capped by an unlikely appearance in the Champions League final in 2019. Pochettino's magic had worn off after 5 1/2 years at the club but, after a four-year break, he would return energized. The fans would certainly like it, though chairman Daniel Levy might have moved on. Pochettino has been without a job since leaving Paris Saint-Germain in July.JULIAN NAGELSMANNThe 35-year-old Nagelsmann is available after being fired by Bayern Munich on Friday. He is young and ambitious and might have his eye on bigger jobs, potentially Real Madrid if Carlo Ancelotti leaves at the end of the season. It would be a reversal of policy, with Tottenham coming off hiring Jose Mourinho and Conte — experienced managers who were a supposed guarantee of trophies. That didn't happen and bringing in Nagelsmann would represent a breath of fresh air, akin to Pochettino when he joined in 2014.ROBERTO DE ZERBIDe Zerbi, an Italian like Conte, has taken Brighton to new levels since joining as a replacement for Graham Potter in September. The team has lost just one of its last 13 games after adapting to De Zerbi's bold playing style and is in a good position to qualify for Europe for the first time. A sharp tactician, De Zerbi is unlikely to be short of offers in the coming years so Tottenham could get in first by making an aggressive appointment.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/27,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848288,Chelsea blames financial losses on sanctions on Abramovich,"LONDON (AP) — Chelsea reported losses of 121 million pounds ($148 million) in 2021-22, with the club on Monday citing the sanctions imposed on former owner Roman Abramovich as a major factor.Abramovich was sanctioned by the British government last March as it sought to freeze the assets of individuals it believed had connections to Vladimir Putin following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.Chelsea was placed under a special license that restricted the club's ability to sell tickets, accept event bookings and even sign contracts with players. The restrictions remained in place until May, when the club was bought by a consortium led by American businessman Todd Boehly.In a statement, Chelsea said the restrictions “resulted in extraordinary expenses and loss of revenue.”“Furthermore, some of these limitations are also expected to have an impact on the financials in the following years due to the long-term impact from restrictions on entering into new contractual arrangements,” Chelsea said.Chelsea said turnover in the last financial year, ending June 2022, increased by 47.6 million pounds ($58.4 million) to 481.3 million pounds ($590 million).The financial results do not include the club's spending spree of around $630 million on new players over the last two transfer windows.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/27,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848289,Kansas high court signals continued abortion rights support,"TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) — Kansas’ highest court signaled Monday that it still considers access to abortion a “fundamental” right under the state constitution, as an attorney for the state argued that a decisive statewide vote last year affirming abortion rights “doesn't matter.""The state Supreme Court is considering exactly how far the Republican-controlled Legislature can go in restricting abortion under a 2019 decision protecting abortion rights. The justices heard arguments from attorneys for Kansas and abortion providers in two lawsuits but isn't likely to rule for months.One lawsuit challenges a 2015 law banning a common second-trimester abortion procedure, and the other challenges a 2011 law that regulates abortion providers more strictly than other health care providers. Legal challenges have blocked both laws from being enforced.The U.S. Supreme Court declared in June 2022 that the U.S. Constitution doesn't protect abortion rights and that states can ban abortion, but the Kansas court had ruled in 2019 that access to abortion is protected as a matter of bodily autonomy under the state constitution. That led the Legislature to put a proposed amendment on last August's ballot asking voters whether to lift that constitutional protection, which would have allowed lawmakers to greatly restrict or ban abortion. Voters soundly rejected the measure.But Kansas Solicitor General Tony Powell, representing the state, told the court that last year's vote “doesn't matter” and shouldn't factor into its decisions on the two lawsuits, arguing that voters might not have wanted abortion banned but still favor “reasonable” restrictions. He said the justices should “let the people work it out” through their elected representatives.Powell told reporters afterward: “The court is in the best position to remedy any mistakes that it made.”Five of the six justices present for the arguments expressed skepticism while questioning Powell, who at one point said, “I’m doing the best I can.”“We had a vote in August, and it was pretty overwhelming,” Justice Dan Biles told him. “That’s the elephant in the room.”The justices did ask Alice Wang, a Center for Reproductive Rights attorney representing the abortion providers, whether preserving life was a compelling state interest. She said that question was before the state Supreme Court when it ruled in 2019.“This court declined to recognize any compelling interest,"" Wang said.Kansas allows most abortions until the 22nd week of pregnancy, attracting patients from other states with bans, most notably Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas. Abortion rights opponents fear that Kansas courts will overturn many of the restrictions imposed over the past 30 years.The state is asking the state Supreme Court to overturn its 2019 decision, but the two cases also give the court the chance to narrow that ruling's scope by upholding either or both laws.Many Republicans had expected Kansas voters to approve the proposed state constitutional change in August, and Powell acknowledged that he was “boxed in” by the state's failure to challenge much of the evidence presented by abortion providers to the trial court judge.Powell repeatedly argued that the justices also ought to consider federal court decisions or even decisions from other states’ courts.“I think the court should have its blinders off,” he said.Among Republican-leaning states, Kansas is an outlier in preserving abortion access, in part because the state's abortion opponents preferred making year-by-year incremental changes prior to last year's U.S. Supreme Court ruling.However, the state still forces patients to wait 24 hours before getting an abortion, requires minors to get parental consent, spells out what patients must be told in writing beforehand and even mandates that the information for patients be printed in 12-point Times New Roman type.Three members of the court's 6-1 majority retired after the 2019 decision, but their replacements all were appointed by Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly, a strong abortion rights supporter. One of the new justices, K.J. Wall, recused himself from the cases, so six justices will decide them. The court did not give a reason for Wall's action.The 2019 ruling came in the early stages of the lawsuit over the ban on the second-trimester procedure. The justices kept the law on hold but sent the case back to the trial court to examine the ban further. A trial judge said the law could not stand.The law deals with a certain type of dilation and evacuation, or D&E, procedure. According to state health department statistics, about 500 D&E procedures are done in Kansas each year, accounting for 6% of the state's total abortions. About 90% of the state's abortions occur in the first trimester.A D&E procedure ban would force providers to use alternative methods that the Center for Reproductive Rights, an abortion rights advocate, has said are riskier for the patient and more expensive. Biles hit on that argument repeatedly during Monday's hearing.Abortion providers saw the law requiring them to comply with stricter regulations than other types than of doctors as an attempt to regulate them out of business. Before it was set to take effect in July 2011, it appeared briefly that no Kansas provider would be able to comply, though a Kansas City-area Planned Parenthood clinic ultimately did. A trial court judge ruled that the state had no justification for rules applying only to abortion providers, and the state appealed.Those behind the clinic regulation law argued that it would make clinics safer for women seeking abortions. Several justices were skeptical that the state has a compelling reason to treat abortion clinics differently than other health care providers.The state's argument for banning the second-trimester procedure was summed up in how they wrote the law. It specifically would prohibit doctors from using forceps or similar instruments on a live fetus to remove it from the womb in pieces. Such instruments are used in some D&E abortions.Although Powell derided the specific method as “heinous,” Biles told him that there is no evidence in the record that it is worse for the fetus than the alternatives.___Follow John Hanna on Twitter: https://www.twitter.com/apjdhanna",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848290,How Netanyahu judicial plan sparked massive unrest in Israel,"JERUSALEM (AP) — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s proposed judicial overhaul unleashed the most intense social unrest in Israel in decades before he announced Monday that he would delay the plan.Tens of thousands of people repeatedly took to the streets to protest the proposal — including spontaneous mass demonstrations that erupted across the country late Sunday after he fired his defense minister for questioning the overhaul. Business leaders, bank chiefs, fighter pilots, military reservists, academics, former security commanders and other influential sectors of society also came out against the plan.On Monday, Israel’s largest trade union declared a general strike — paralyzing the country’s international airport — and thousands of people gathered outside parliament.Later in the day, Netanyahu announced he would delay the overhaul, saying he was still determined to pass a judicial reform but would take the time to seek a compromise. The head of the country’s largest trade union responded by saying it would call off a general strike that threatened to grind the country's economy to a halt.Here’s a look at Israel's most serious domestic crisis in decades:HOW DID WE GET HERE?Netanyahu, who is on trial for corruption in three separate cases, has been at the center of political turmoil that has plagued the country since 2019.After he was indicted, Netanyahu’s former governing partners turned on him, and he was unable to form a stable, lasting coalition. That led to a protracted political crisis that sent Israelis to the polls five times in less than four years.After an 18-month political exile as opposition leader, Netanyahu returned to power late last year in a coalition with ultra-Orthodox and ultranationalist allies, forming the country’s most right-wing government ever. He denies wrongdoing in the corruption cases.___WHAT IS THE JUDICIAL OVERHAUL ABOUT?After taking power, key figures in Netanyahu’s Likud Party along with his governing partners pledged to quickly overhaul the country’s judicial system, which critics say is driven by a desire to push their ideological agendas with less judicial oversight. The changes would give the governing coalition control over judicial appointments and weaken the country's Supreme Court by granting parliament the authority to overturn its decisions and limiting judicial review of laws.Opponents say the overhaul would upend the country’s delicate system of checks and balances by giving Netanyahu's ruling coalition control over what is now an independent judiciary. They also say Netanyahu has a deep conflict of interest in trying to reshape the legal system while on trial.The government says the legal changes are necessary to streamline governance in the face of an interventionist judiciary.___WHAT FUELED THE LATEST PROTESTS?Israel has experienced nearly three months of mass protests since Netanyahu’s confidant, Justice Minister Yariv Levin, unveiled the overhaul in January.But the eruption of anger over Defense Minister Yoav Gallant's dismissal, organized quickly largely via the WhatsApp messaging app, was startling. In roughly one hour, tens of thousands of people blocked Tel Aviv’s main highway, and thousands more demonstrated outside Netanyahu’s Jerusalem home.Gallant was the first Cabinet minister to break ranks and publicly call for a delay in the overhaul. With morale down and soldiers threatening not to report for duty, Gallant said that pushing ahead could hurt Israel’s military readiness.In security-obsessed Israel, Gallant, a gruff retired general, is among the most respected members of the new Cabinet. By attacking the man responsible for national security, Netanyahu may have crossed a red line — and unwittingly united this deeply polarized country by touching upon national security, one of the few areas of consensus.___WHAT WAS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE GENERAL STRIKE?Israel’s largest trade union is one of the most powerful institutions in the country, representing nearly 800,000 people across sectors that include health care, banking, government services, day care and transportation.While the union has crippled parts of the economy in past labor disputes over the years, never before has it gone on strike to protest a political matter.The decision was felt almost immediately. Israel’s main international airport canceled all outgoing flights, stranding more than 70,000 travelers. Doctors and day care workers said they would stay off the job, and others were expected to join as well.The economy already has been hit by the protests, with the shekel currency tumbling in value in recent weeks. A protracted strike could have meant longer-lasting and deeper damage.___WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?The pause Netanyahu declared could help ease the tensions and buy him some time to find a compromise. But it also runs the risk of angering his far-right coalition partners — potentially threatening the stability of his government and risking the possibility of new elections.Any new election would once again likely focus again on Netanyahu's suitability to govern while he faces serious legal problems.___WHAT EFFECT COULD THE JUDICIAL OVERHAUL HAVE OUTSIDE ISRAEL?While the battle may seem like an internal Israeli matter, its outcome could have important repercussions for the region and beyond.Netanyahu's coalition allies are dominated by religious and nationalist hardliners who oppose Palestinian statehood and have close ties to the West Bank settlement movement. A weaker court system could clear the way for more aggressive settlement construction and even annexation of West Bank lands. That could lead to further friction with the Palestinians, who seek the Israeli-occupied West Bank as part of a future independent state, as well as with Israel's Western allies, who have voiced concerns about the overhaul and criticized the comments of some of his partners.Israeli soldiers could also be more susceptible to war crimes prosecution in the Hague. One of Israel's key defenses has been that it has an independent judiciary capable of investigating and prosecuting wrongdoing by troops. A weakened judiciary could rob Israel of that defense.Israel's high-tech industry, the engine of the country's economy, could also be affected. International agencies have already said they might lower Israel's debt rating if the overhaul passes since the agencies consider a strong judiciary crucial to ensuring a good business climate. A lower rating could make investors hesitant to do business in Israel and potentially lead companies with operations in Israel, including the world's leading tech giants, to scale back their presence.___Goldenberg reported from Tel Aviv, Israel.",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848291,UK pushes on with asylum law despite rights group opposition,"LONDON (AP) — The British government pushed its contentious migration bill forward in Parliament on Monday, despite a call from Europe’s top human rights organization for lawmakers to block the legislation.The Illegal Migration Bill would bar asylum claims by anyone who reaches the U.K. by unauthorized means, and compel the government to detain and then deport them “to their home country or a safe third country.” They would be banned from ever reentering the U.K.As the House of Commons held the first of two days of debate on the legislation, the 46-nation Council of Europe said the bill’s provisions “create clear and direct tension with well-established and fundamental human rights standards.”“It is essential that parliamentarians prevent legislation that is incompatible with the United Kingdom’s international obligations being passed,” the council’s human rights commissioner, Dunja Mijatović, said in a letter to British lawmakers.Prime Minister Rishi Sunak insisted the legislation did not breach Britain’s international obligations.“This is a tough piece of legislation, the likes of which we haven’t seen,” he said. “It’s important that it is effective, which it will be. It is also important that we abide by our international obligations. This is a country and a government that does follow the law.”Britain receives fewer asylum-seekers than some European nations such as Italy, Germany or France. But thousands of migrants from around the world travel to northern France each year in hopes of reaching the U.K., drawn by family ties, the English language or the perceived ease of getting a job.Most attempt the journey in dinghies and other small craft now that authorities have clamped down on other routes such as stowing away on buses or trucks. More than 45,000 people arrived in Britain by boat in 2022, up from 28,000 in 2021 and 8,500 in 2020.The government says the new law, once approved by Parliament, will deter migrants and hobble smuggling gangs who send desperate people on hazardous journeys across one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes.But charities and refugee groups say it is unethical, unworkably and likely illegal. The United Nations’ refugee agency said the law would be a “clear breach of the Refugee Convention” and amount to an “asylum ban.”The government is facing competing calls from legislators to toughen up and water down the bill.Legislators from the right wing of the governing Conservative Party want the government to go even further and act to prevent the European Court of Human Rights from blocking deportations.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848292,Key takeaways from AP’s report on China's influence in Utah,"SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — China's global influence campaign has been surprisingly robust and successful in Utah, an investigation by The Associated Press has found.The world's most powerful communist country and its U.S.-based advocates have spent years building relationships with Utah officials.Legislators in the deeply conservative and religious state have responded by delaying legislation Beijing didn’t like, nixing resolutions that conveyed displeasure with China's actions and expressing support in ways that enhanced the Chinese government’s image.The AP's investigation relied on dozens of interviews with key players and the review of hundreds of pages of records, text messages and emails obtained through public records’ requests.Beijing’s success in Utah shows “how pervasive and persistent China has been in trying to influence America,” said Frank Montoya Jr., a retired FBI counterintelligence agent who lives in Utah.“Utah is an important foothold,” he said. “If the Chinese can succeed in Salt Lake City, they can also make it in New York and elsewhere.”Here are some key takeaways:LEGISLATIVE AND PR VICTORIESThe AP review found that China and its advocates won frequent legislative and public relations victories in Utah.Utah lawmakers recorded videos of themselves expressing words of encouragement for the citizens of Shanghai in early 2020, which experts said likely helped the Chinese Communist Party with its messaging.The request came from a Chinese official as the government was scrambling to tamp down public fury at communist authorities for reprimanding a young doctor, who later died, over his warnings about the dangers posed by COVID-19.Around the same time, Utah officials were thrilled when China's authoritarian leader Xi Jinping sent a letter to fourth grade students in Utah. A Republican legislator said on the state Senate floor that he “couldn’t help but think how amazing it was” that Xi would take the time to write such a “remarkable” letter. Another GOP senator gushed on his conservative radio show that Xi’s letter “was so kind and so personal.”The letter was heavily covered in Chinese state media, which quoted Utah students calling Xi a kind “grandpa” — a familiar trope in Chinese propaganda.State lawmakers have frequently visited China, where they are often quoted in state-owned media in ways that support Beijing’s agenda.“Utah is not like Washington D.C.,” then-Utah House Speaker Greg Hughes, a vocal supporter of former President Donald Trump, told the Chinese state media outlet in 2018 as the former president ratcheted up pressure on China over trade. “Utah is a friend of China, an old friend with a long history.”FBI SCRUTINYUtah Republican Sen. Jake Anderegg told the AP he was interviewed by the FBI after introducing a 2020 resolution expressing solidarity with China in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic. It won nearly unanimous approval. A similar resolution, proposed by a Chinese diplomat, was publicly rejected by Wisconsin’s Senate.Anderegg said the language was provided to him by Dan Stephenson, the son of a former state senator and employee of a China-based consulting firm.Stephenson and another Utah resident, Taowen Le, are among China's most vocal advocates in Utah.Both men have supported and sought to block resolutions, set up meetings between Utah lawmakers and Chinese officials, accompanied legislators on trips to China and provided advice on the best way to cultivate favor with Beijing, according to emails and interviews. Both have ties to what experts say are front groups for Beijing.After embassy officials tried unsuccessfully last year to get staff for Utah Gov. Spencer Cox to schedule a get-together with China’s ambassador to the U.S., Le sent the governor a personal plea to take such a meeting.“I still remember and cherish what you told me at the New Year Party held at your home,” Le wrote in a letter adorned with pictures of him and Cox posing together. “You told me that you trusted me to be a good messenger and friendship builder between Utah and China.”Both men said their advocacy on China-related issues were self directed and not at the Chinese government's behest. Le told AP he has been interviewed twice over the years by the FBI.The FBI declined to comment.TAILORED APPROACHSecurity experts say that China’s campaign is widespread and tailored to local communities. In Utah, the AP found, Beijing and pro-China advocates appealed to lawmakers’ affiliations with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, better known as the Mormon church, which is the state’s dominant religion and one that has long dreamed of expanding in China.Le, who converted to the church decades ago, has quoted scripture from the Bible and the Book of Mormon in his emails and letters to lawmakers, and sprinkled in positive comments that Russell Nelson, the church’s president-prophet, has made about China.PART OF BROADER TRENDBeijing's success in Utah is part of a broader trend of targeting “sub-national” governments, like states and cities, experts say.It is not unusual for countries, including the U.S., to engage in local diplomacy. U.S. officials and security experts have stressed that many Chinese language and cultural exchanges have no hidden agendas. However, they said, few nations have so aggressively courted local leaders across the globe in ways that raise national security concerns.In its annual threat assessment released earlier this month, the U.S. intelligence community reported that China is “redoubling” its local influence campaign in the face of stiffening resistance at the national level. Beijing believes, the report said, that “local officials are more pliable than their federal counterparts.”Authorities in other countries, including Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom, have sounded similar alarms.A spokesman for the Chinese embassy in Washington told the AP that China “values its relationship with Utah” and any “words and deeds that stigmatize and smear these sub-national exchanges are driven by ulterior political purposes.”___Suderman reported from Washington.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848293,Louvre staff block entrances as part of pension protest,"PARIS (AP) — The Louvre Museum in Paris was closed to the public on Monday when its workers took part in the wave of French protest strikes against the government's unpopular pension reform plans.Dozens of Louvre employees blocked the entrance, prompting the museum to announce it would be temporarily closed.The demonstrators toted banners and flags in front of the Louvre's famed pyramid, where President Emmanuel Macron had celebrated his presidential victory in 2017. They demanded the repeal of the new pension law that raises the retirement age from 62 to 64.The showbusiness, broadcasting and culture branch of the CGT union tweeted an image of the Mona Lisa with an aged and wrinkled face, with the words: “64 it’s a No!”The action comes on the eve of another nationwide protest planned for Tuesday against the bill — and as Macron holds a meeting with Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne to discuss the way forward. The Louvre is always closed on Tuesdays, so staff protested a day earlier.Some tourists were stoic about the artistic blockade.“If you firmly believe that this will bring some change, there’s plenty of other things that we can see in Paris,"" said Britney Tate, a 29-year-old doctoral student from California.Others who had traveled thousands of miles were more vocal about the inconvenience.“We’re going to respect their strike tomorrow, but to do this today, it’s just heartbreaking,” said Karma Carden, a tourist from Fort Myers, Florida. “We knew that Versailles would not be open because of the protest, but we knew the Louvre was open.""I understand why they’re upset, but (it's bad) to do this to people from around the world who’ve traveled from around the world for this and paid thousands of dollars,” she added.",2023/03/28,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848303,The Pros and Cons of Being a Solo Entrepreneur vs. Having a Co-Founder,"Beginning a business is an exciting but difficult journey that necessitates careful planning, hard work, and dedication. One of the most important early decisions an entrepreneur must make is whether to go it alone or find a co-founder. Both options have advantages and disadvantages, and the choice is ultimately determined by the individual’s goals, personality, and circumstances.Going solo entails starting and running your own business. While it provides complete autonomy and control, it also means that you are responsible for all responsibilities, risks, and costs. To succeed as a solo entrepreneur, you must wear many hats, from marketing and sales to operations and finances, and you must have a diverse set of skills.One of the most significant benefits of being a solo entrepreneur is having complete control over decision-making. Because there is no one to answer to, the entrepreneur can make decisions quickly and act on them without any obstacles or delays. This adaptability can be especially useful in the early stages of a business when quick decisions are critical to success.Personal Fulfillment: As a solo entrepreneur, you can pursue your passions and interests without having to compromise with a partner or team. Because entrepreneur can set their own schedule and work at their own pace, solo entrepreneurship can also be a great way to achieve work-life balance.Lower Overhead: Starting a business can be expensive, and having a co-founder means splitting the costs of everything from equipment to rent. As a solo entrepreneur, however, you only have to cover your own expenses, which can be a significant advantage in the early stages when cash flow is limited.Limited Skill Set: As a sole proprietor, you are in charge of everything from marketing to accounting to customer service. While some entrepreneurs excel in all areas, others may struggle with specific tasks, resulting in a lack of business growth or success.Loneliness: Starting a business can be an isolating experience, and solo entrepreneurs may miss the camaraderie and support of a co-founder or team. Inadequate social interaction can also have a negative impact on mental health, leading to feelings of isolation and burnout.Limited Resources: As a solo entrepreneur, you have limited resources, including time, money, and expertise. This can make it challenging to scale the business, as you may not have the resources to invest in new projects or hire additional staff.Shared Responsibility: Having a co-founder means sharing responsibilities and decision-making, which can be a significant benefit. Entrepreneurs can bounce ideas off each other, brainstorm solutions to problems, and divide tasks based on their strengths and weaknesses when they have two heads working together.Shared Risk: Starting a business is risky, and having a co-founder shares that risk. Entrepreneurs can split the costs of starting a business with a partner, making it easier to get started and take on larger projects.Diverse Skill Set: Co-founders can bring a wide range of skills and expertise to the table, which can be beneficial in the development of a successful business. While one partner may excel in marketing, the other may be more skilled in finance or operations, resulting in a synergistic partnership.Managing conflict is one of the most difficult aspects of having a co-founder. Disagreements can arise between two people who have opposing ideas and opinions, causing tension and potentially damaging the business relationship.Shared Control: Decisions must be made jointly with a co-founder, which can be a disadvantage for entrepreneurs who prefer complete control. Stalemates or delays can also result from disagreements over direction or strategy.Inequity: When there is a co-founder, there is the possibility of unequal contributions, which can lead to resentment and tension. One partner may believe they are putting in more effort or contributing more money than the other, resulting in disagreements over equity and profit-sharing.Communication contact:Global Business Development Teams – Market.usMarket.us (Powered By Prudour Pvt.

According to the Ministry of the Interior in Taiwan, the proportion of the population aged 65 and older increased from 7.09% in 1993 to 15.51% in 2020 (Ministry of the Interior, Taiwan, 2020).This rapid increase in the older adult population has prompted policymakers in Taiwan and other Asian nations to invest in aging-related programs and services, such as Long-Term Care Insurance and community-based care programs.What is Long-Term Health Care?Long-term care is the support and assistance provided to individuals with chronic illnesses, disabilities, or other conditions that limit their ability to perform daily activities. It includes services such as nursing care, home health aides, and other social support. The need for long-term care is growing rapidly due to an aging population and increased life expectancy. However, long-term care costs are becoming a major burden for families and governments worldwide, including in the United States and Asian nations such as Taiwan.Long-Term Care Insurance has been available in the United States and Canada for decades as part of a private insurance system for those families who wish to protect personal assets and maintain control of their choice of care services.Long-term care services are costly in the United States, and those costs will continue to rise in the decades ahead.LTC NEWS Cost of Care Calculator – Find Your LocationThe cost of long-term care services in Taiwan and other Asian nations varies depending on the type of care, and the level of support required. In Taiwan, the government has implemented a Long-Term Care Insurance program that aims to provide affordable and accessible care for older adults and individuals with disabilities. The program is funded by a combination of government contributions, premiums paid by insured individuals, and co-payments by their family members.According to the Ministry of Health and Welfare in Taiwan, the premiums for Long-Term Care Insurance are based on the age of the insured individual and their income level, with the maximum premium being capped at NT$15,600 (approximately USD $530) per year (Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taiwan, 2021). The insurance covers a range of services, including in-home care, adult day care, respite care, and institutional care.In the United States, premiums are not funded by any level of government, but some tax advantages do exist. Premiums vary depending on several factors, including age, health, and family history.How Much Does Long-Term Care Insurance Cost in the United States?In other Asian nations, the cost of long-term care services can vary depending on the availability of public services and the prevalence of private providers. For example, in Japan, the government provides financial support for long-term care services. However, the cost of care can still be high for individuals and their families, particularly for those who require intensive support (OECD, 2020).In Singapore, the government provides subsidies for long-term care services through the ElderShield and CareShield Life insurance schemes, but some individuals may still face significant out-of-pocket expenses (Ministry of Health, Singapore, 2021).Overall, the cost of long-term care services in Asian nations highlights the importance of investing in aging-related programs and policies to ensure that older adults and individuals with disabilities have access to affordable and high-quality care.The Taiwanese government’s Long-Term Care Insurance program is an example of a successful approach to addressing the needs of the aging population and promoting their well-being, while also recognizing the financial constraints that families may face. As the number of older adults continues to increase in Asia and around the world, it is crucial that policymakers and healthcare providers work together to ensure that adequate support and resources are available to meet their needs.While the aging population presents challenges for both the United States and Asian nations, there are also unique cultural and societal factors at play in how this demographic shift is experienced. For example, in many Asian cultures, there is a strong tradition of filial piety, or the obligation of adult children to care for their aging parents (Chan, 2011). This cultural norm has influenced the development of aging-related policies and programs in many Asian nations, such as Taiwan’s Long-Term Care Insurance program, which is funded by both the government and the adult children of older adults (Chen et al., 2018).Global Long-Term Care CostsThe cost of long-term care is increasing worldwide, driven by the aging population and higher demand for services. In 2020, the global expenditure on long-term care was estimated at $1.4 trillion, and this figure is expected to rise to $2.5 trillion by 2030 (KPMG, 2021). These costs are borne by families, governments, and insurers, and they can significantly impact household budgets, public finances, and social welfare systems.In many countries, families are the primary caregivers for elderly relatives, and they often bear the financial burden of long-term care. In the United States, for example, families pay over $470 billion per year in out-of-pocket expenses for long-term care. This can cause significant financial stress for families, particularly those with lower incomes or limited resources.Governments also play a role in funding long-term care, either through public insurance programs or the direct provision of services. However, long-term care costs are growing on public finances, particularly in countries with aging populations and limited resources. For example, in Japan, long-term care costs accounted for 3.7% of GDP in 2019, and this figure is projected to rise to 7.5% by 2050 (OECD, 2021). In some countries, such as India and Indonesia, there is limited public support for long-term care, and families bear almost all of the costs.Impact on FamiliesThe high cost of long-term care can have a significant impact on families, both financially and emotionally. Many families struggle to afford the cost of care, particularly if they have limited incomes or savings. This can lead to difficult choices, such as reducing other expenses or taking on debt. In some cases, families may need to provide care themselves, which can be time-consuming and stressful.In addition to financial stress, long-term care can also have an emotional toll on families. Caregiving can be a demanding and exhausting task, and it can strain relationships between family members. Caregivers may also face isolation and loneliness, as they often need to prioritize the care of their loved ones over their own social activities and relationships.Impact on GovernmentsThe rising cost of long-term care also places a growing burden on governments worldwide. In many countries, public insurance programs are the primary funding source for long-term health care, but these programs are often underfunded and struggle to keep up with the growing demand for services. This can lead to long waiting lists for care, and some individuals may not receive the care they need.Governments also face challenges in managing the quality of care provided. Long-term care is a complex and often highly regulated sector, and ensuring that care providers meet high-quality standards can be difficult. In addition, some governments struggle to attract and retain qualified care providers, particularly in rural or remote areas.Comparison of the United States and TaiwanThe United States and Taiwan are two countries that have very different approaches to long-term care. The United States has a predominantly private long-term care system, with individuals and families responsible for financing their own care. In contrast, Taiwan has a nationalized long-term care system, with the government providing comprehensive coverage for long-term care services.The United StatesIn the United States, long-term care is primarily funded through private insurance or out-of-pocket expenses. Medicare, the federal health insurance program for people over 65, does not cover long-term care services, except in limited circumstances. Medicaid, the joint federal-state program for low-income individuals, does cover long-term care, but only for those who meet strict eligibility criteria based on income and assets.As a result, many families in the United States struggle to afford the cost of long-term care. According to the LTC NEWS Cost of Care Calculator, the average cost of a private room in a nursing home was $108,199 per year, while the average cost of a home health aide was $57,087 per year. These costs can quickly deplete savings and retirement accounts, leaving families with limited resources unless they own Long-Term Care Insurance.The high cost of long-term care in the United States has also led to disparities in access to care. Wealthier families are more likely to be able to afford high-quality care, while lower-income families may need to rely on Medicaid, which often provides lower-quality care and has limited provider options.TaiwanThe Taiwanese system of long-term care is designed to be accessible and affordable for all citizens. All Taiwanese citizens over the age of 65 are eligible for long-term care services, regardless of their income or health status. Services are provided in a range of settings, including nursing homes, community-based care centers, and home-based care.The Taiwanese long-term care system has successfully improved access to care and reduced the financial burden on families. A 2019 study found that the system had significantly increased the use of long-term care services, particularly among low-income and rural populations. The system has also been successful in reducing the financial burden on families, with out-of-pocket expenses for long-term care services accounting for less than 20% of total long-term care spending in Taiwan.Other Asian NationsTaiwan is not the only Asian nation that has implemented a nationalized system of long-term care. Other countries in the region, including Japan, South Korea, and Singapore, have also implemented comprehensive systems of long-term care coverage.Japan has a long history of providing long-term care services, and has implemented a national insurance program for long-term care. The program provides coverage for a range of services, including nursing care, home-based care, and institutional care. However, the program is facing challenges due to an aging population and increasing demand for services.South Korea has also implemented a national insurance program for long-term care, which provides coverage for a range of services, including home-based care, day care, and institutional care. The program is funded through a combination of government revenue and social insurance premiums.Singapore has a hybrid system of long-term care, with the government providing subsidies and support for long-term care services, but also encouraging individuals to save for their own long-term care needs. The government has also implemented a range of policies to support family caregivers, including providing caregiver training and support.ConclusionThe rising cost of long-term care is a global challenge, with families and governments around the world struggling to cope with the growing demand for services. The United States and Taiwan represent two very different approaches to long-term care, with the United States relying primarily on private insurance and out-of-pocket expenses, while Taiwan has implemented a nationalized system that combines government funding and insurance.Despite how a nation decides to plan for long-term health care, one thing remains in common globally. Aging is a reality and impacts families, finances, and government, and the problem will grow in the decades ahead.About Matt McCann, CLTC®Matt McCann is a well specialist on long-term care planning and is well known speaker on long-term health care issues and is sought after by the media for his expertise.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848334,Uni-Bio Science Group Limited Announces 2022 Annual Results,"Record High Turnover of HK$440.3 Million and HK$38.5 Million Profit Achieved   Expanding Portfolio with New Drug Innovations and Strategic R&D Partnerships    HONG KONG SAR - EQS Newswire - 27 March 2023 - A fully integrated biopharmaceutical company –  Uni-Bio Science Group Limited (""Uni-Bio Science"", together with its subsidiaries referred to as the ""Group"", stock code: 0690.HK), is pleased to announce its annual results for the year ended 31 December 2022 (the ""Year"").   Key Accomplishments in 2022   During the Year, the Group achieved a spectrum of accomplishments, for both of its marketed products and innovative biologics. The key highlights include:         During the Year, the Group achieved a record high turnover of HK$440.3 million, representing a noticeable increase of 24.6% year-on-year (""YoY""). Sales of Pinup® and Boshutai® performed exceptionally well, registering an increase of 51.2% and 292.5% YoY respectively.             The Group made a remarkable turnaround, posting a profit of HK$38.5 million with a significant increase of 296.6% YoY, marking an important milestone for a research-oriented biopharmaceutical company.             The Group's Acarbose Tablets (Boshutai®) was successfully awarded the drug alliance procurement bid for the second and fourth batches of medicines for two years in the 13-provinces Alliance Procurement. To meet the growing demand for Boshutai®, the Group had already expanded its production capacity at its strategic partner's Suzhou production site to ensure supply stability.             New Drug Application (""NDA"") of the Group's Bogutai® (teriparatide injection) had been accepted by the China National Medical Products Administration (""NMPA"") and completed the China Center for Food and Drug Inspections (""CFDI"") registration site verification. Bogutai® will be the Group's fifth marketed drug and the first domestically manufactured PTH Liquid in China to use a disposable injection pen.             The Group has continuously improved EGF process technology and increased the production capacity of the drug substance to 4 times the original amount, further enhancing production efficiency, reducing costs, while opening up new formulation opportunities.             The formulation development of oral form Uni-GLP-1 was completed, and the results showed that its bioavailability was superior to the positive control oral semaglutide. Currently, formal animal studies in beagle dogs are under preparation to further validate the bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of the oral form Uni-GLP-1 in animals. The clinical work of Uni-GLP-1 injection pen is on schedule for related pharmacological studies.             The Group's fibronectin products are shown to be as effective as natural fibronectin derived from human blood. During the Year, the Group had completed the development of fibronectin raw material, which have high yield and high activity. It will be the first advanced skincare raw material of the Group to be launched.      Annual Results   In 2022, the Group recorded a record-breaking revenue of approximately HK$440.3 million, representing a significant increase of 24.6% year-on-year (2021: HK$353.4 million). The increase in revenue was mainly attributable to the impressive sales growth of Pinup® and Boshutai®. Pinup® saw a remarkable increase of 51.2% in revenue, jumping from approximately HK$142.2 million to approximately HK$215.1 million for the Year. The increase was attributable to Pinup®'s inclusion in the national centralized procurement in 2021, which has secured the Group with substantial hospital orders. During the Year, revenue of Boshutai® increased substantially from approximately HK$4.5 million to approximately HK$17.4 million, representing a significant increase of 292.5%. GeneSoft® recorded an increase in revenue from approximately HK$36.3 million to approximately HK$38.4 million, representing an increase of 6.0%. Revenue generated from GeneTime® was approximately HK$169.4 million, representing a decrease of 0.6% from approximately HK$170.5 million in 2021. Despite the pandemic-related production interruptions in the first quarter of 2022, the Group quickly resumed and upgraded production of GeneTime®. As a result, sales of GeneTime® resumed growth in the second half of the Year, offsetting the earlier shortfall.   Gross profit was approximately HK$334.9 million, representing an increase of 20.9% as compared with approximately HK$277.0 million in 2021, whereas gross profit margin was 76.1% (2021: 78.4%). Thanks to the Group's diligent internal control, general and administrative expenses accounted for merely 10.7% of revenue in 2022 as compared with 13.3% in 2021. The selling and distribution expense for the Year also decreased to 48.0% of revenue from 52.5% in 2021. The R&D expenses decreased by 28.8% to approximately HK$35.8 million due to the completion of several clinical tests and the capitalization of development expenses.   The Group's commitment to cost control and profitability resulted in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (""EBITDA"") for the Year of HK$65.8 million as compared to HK$13.7 million in 2021. Net cash flow of HK$48.7 million from operating activities for the Year was recorded, representing the second consecutive year of positive cash flow for the Group. The Group recorded a profit of approximately HK$38.5 million for the Year, a remarkable increase of 296.6% year-on-year (2021: loss of HK$19.6 million). Basic earnings per share was approximately HK$0.61 cents (2021 basic loss per share HK$0.31 cents).   Prospects   Despite the reopening of borders, global economic headwinds are expected to continue in 2023 due to rising interest rates, inflation, and geopolitical trends. These factors will create economic shifts and challenges for businesses in areas such as trade, investment, and labor. Yet, with the implementation of the ""Healthy China"" strategy and the support of favorable factors such as supportive policies, industry efforts, and capital investments, the pharmaceutical and healthcare sector is expected to remain one of the most dynamic and promising fields in China over the longer term.   Despite the unpredictable headwinds, the Group has consistently maintained a healthy financial position with a positive cash flow and a manageable debt load. Our innovative ""four-wheel drive"" business model, which includes high-value generic drugs, bio-innovative drugs, new skincare raw materials, and CMO business, enables us to diversify our income streams and adapt to changing market conditions. This approach fosters sustainable growth while positioning us as a leader in the competitive biopharmaceutical landscape.   Looking forward,  Mr. Kingsley Leung, Chairman of Uni-Bio Science said, ""We are well-equipped to navigate challenges and capitalize on emerging opportunities, remaining dedicated to product innovations. We have enhanced production capacity four-fold to meet the growing demand of our signature EGF products. We have also been exploring different applications of the EGF products while developing different dosage forms of the EGF products, such as gel form, film form, and VSD foam dressings. The single-dose form of GeneSoft® (no preservatives) utilizing the Blowing Filling and Sealing packaging technology has also been under development, which can reduce the risk of cross-infection as well as is safer and more convenient to use. This technology will also be used to develop Diquafosol Sodium Eye Drops, which is complementary to GeneSoft®.   Besides product innovation, our product development has also come to fruition. Bogutai®, the first domestically manufacturing PTH Liquid in China to use a disposable injection pen, will be approved for product launch by September 2023. It will become our fifth marketed and self-developed drug. We believe that Bogutai® will become another signature product. Meanwhile, our first advanced raw skincare material, fibronectin, is also ready for market launch in 2023. We believe with these products will further diversify our revenue stream and will ride on the growing market opportunities. At the same time, we have been preparing for the new round of national centralized procurement for Pinup®, which will be launched as soon as in April 2023. As Pinup® was among the first to be selected in the fourth batch of the national centralized procurement, the Group will enjoy the advantage and is confident to be selected in the upcoming procurement.   Uni-Bio is steadfast in its efforts to strengthen its comprehensive R&D capabilities and broaden its portfolio of best-in-class products. We have been partnering with Alephoson Biopharmaceuticals Ltd. and DotBio Pte. Ltd. to investigate the potential application of Cell Penetration Protein Alternation Technology (CePPA) and co-develop next-generation best-in-class compounds in ophthalmology and other potential therapeutic areas since late 2021. We have also committed to the research of innovative delivery technology for oral drugs of peptide drugs to solve many pain points caused by traditional single drug delivery. Some of which under development include 3rd generation oral form of Uni-PTH, oral dosage form of Uni-GLP-1, as well as Uni-GLP-1 injection pen. Through these efforts, we aim to further diversify the formulation choices of the Group's marketed and future products, providing better solutions that meet the evolving needs of patients.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848336,Saudi Aramco to invest billions in Chinese petrochemicals,"RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) — Saudi Arabia's state-owned oil giant Aramco will invest billions of dollars in China's downstream petrochemicals industry, including the construction of a new refinery, the company said in deals announced Sunday and Monday.The announcements came as the company posted a record profit of more than $160 billion in 2022 and as Saudi Arabia, a longtime U.S. ally, has developed closer ties with Beijing in recent years.Aramco will acquire a 10% interest in China's Rongsheng Petrochemical Co. Ltd,, a purchase valued at $3.6 billion. Under a long-term sales agreement, Aramco will supply 480,000 barrels per day to Rongsheng affiliate Zhejiang Pettroleum and Chemical Co. Ltd., which owns and operates China's largest refining and chemicals complex.“This announcement demonstrates Aramco’s long-term commitment to China and belief in the fundamentals of the Chinese petrochemicals sector,"" Aramco executive vice president Mohammed Al Qahtani said in a statement. ""It also promises to secure a reliable supply of essential crude to one of China’s most important refiners.”On Sunday, Aramco announced plans to construct a new refinery and petrochemical complex in northeastern China through a joint venture. Aramco, which holds a 30% stake in the Huajin Aramco Petrochemical Company, would supply 210,000 barrels per day of crude to the complex.Saudi Arabia has cultivated closer ties with both Russia and China in recent years. Earlier this month, Saudi Arabia and Iran agreed to restore diplomatic ties for the first time since 2016 in a deal brokered by Beijing even as Riyadh announced a massive contract to buy commercial planes from U.S. manufacturer Boeing.",2023/03/27,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848337,Harry Kane has a decision to make about his future,"MANCHESTER, England (AP) — Harry Kane likely knew what was awaiting him after he celebrated becoming England’s all-time leading scorer.Within hours of his 55th goal for his national team on Sunday came confirmation of Antonio Conte’s departure as manager of Tottenham by “mutual agreement.”Conte leaves after failing to end the London club's 15-year wait for a trophy and Kane’s own pursuit of silverware. The Italian coach has been a serial winner with Juventus, Chelsea and Inter Milan, but could not maintain that record at Tottenham, despite spending about $140 million on transfers.Kane, who was presented with a golden boot ahead of England's 2-0 win over Ukraine at Wembley Stadium on Sunday after surpassing Wayne Rooney's scoring record, may wonder if any manager can turn Tottenham into a winning team.“The individual accolades are well deserved and are amazing. But he wants to be part of a team that is successful,” England coach Gareth Southgate said Sunday.Southgate was referring to the national team's own bid to win a trophy for the first time since 1966, but the same can be said of Kane’s club career.In the last two months, Kane has surpassed late Tottenham great Jimmy Greaves as the club’s leading scorer and Rooney’s England total. Team honors, however, continue to elude him and a fresh round of upheaval at Tottenham has come toward the end of another trophyless campaign.Conte is the seventh full-time managerial appointment at Tottenham since the club’s last trophy — the League Cup in 2008.At the age of 29, Kane's chances of ending his own drought are diminishing. He turns 30 before the start of next season, when he will have a year left on his current contract.“He's got a big decision to make career-wise,” former Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard said Sunday. “I've been there myself, where you're thinking is my team good enough to get me the medals? Am I going to get out my career what I want to get?”Gerrard ended his Liverpool career without winning a Premier League title, but lifted virtually every other major trophy, including the Champions League in 2005.While Kane has a decision to make about his own future, Tottenham must also consider the merits of selling while it can still command a large fee for its star player or risk losing him for nothing next year.Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy was in a strong enough position to block Kane's proposed transfer to Manchester City in 2021, when the player publicly addressed the prospect leaving. The situation is very different two years later, with Kane able to exert more pressure on Tottenham's hierarchy if he chooses to seek a move.City is unlikely to still be in the market for Kane after signing Erling Haaland last year, but he has for a long time been linked with Manchester United. A top-class striker is a priority for United manager Erik ten Hag after the departure of Cristiano Ronaldo in November.A key issue will be his price, with Tottenham reportedly valuing Kane at about $123 million.He would certainly be a statement signing for prospective new owners of United, with Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad Al Thani and Jim Ratcliffe leading the race to buy out the Glazer family.United's American owners want the potential sale to be completed before the transfer window opens at the end of the season and Kane would be an ambitious target at the start of a new regime.United would appear to be one of the few realistic options if Kane were to stay in England, with the player unlikely to want to join a London rival like Chelsea, while City and Liverpool have recently invested heavily in their forward lines.Saudi-backed Newcastle would be another possibility if it qualifies for the Champions League.Overseas, Real Madrid, Barcelona, Paris Saint-Germain and Bayern Munich could all be options, dependent on the price.The prospect of staying in England would give him the opportunity to set another scoring benchmark by overtaking Alan Shearer's Premier League record of 260 goals. Kane currently has 204 goals and is primed to pass Rooney (208) in second place on the all-time list.Even in a Tottenham team that has been inconsistent this season, Kane has scored 21 goals in the league, which is only seven fewer than Haaland.___James Robson is at https://twitter.com/jamesalanrobson___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/27,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848338,Suicide bomber kills 6 people near foreign ministry in Kabul,"ISLAMABAD (AP) — A suicide bomber struck Monday near the foreign ministry in Kabul, killing at least six people and wounding several, according to officials. It was the second time this year that there has been an attack near the ministry.There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the bombing but the regional affiliate of the Islamic State group has increased attacks since the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in mid-August 2021. IS has targeted Taliban officials and patrols, as well as members of the country’s minority Shiites.According to Khalid Zadran, a spokesman for the Kabul police chief, Taliban security forces spotted the bomber before he was able to reach a checkpoint at the Malik Asghar intersection, near the ministry.The attacker then detonated his explosives, killing at least six civilians. Three members of the Taliban security forces were among those wounded in the attack.The Kabul hospital run by the EMERGENCY non-governmental organization said it received two fatalities from the explosion and 12 wounded, including a child.“Among the injured, who are all male, is a child,"" said Stefano Sozza, the NGO’s country director in Afghanistan. ""Once again we are reminded that although the war has ended, we continue to treat victims of violence.”In mid-January, an IS attack near the ministry killed at least five people and wounded several others. Checkpoints line the fortified route to the ministry, which is on one of the roads leading to the presidential palace. Guards stop and search vehicles and people along the way.The Islamic State group has also claimed other recent attacks in Kabul, including a bombing near a checkpoint at the city’s military airport that killed and wounded several people and also an assault on a Kabul hotel in mid-December.",2023/03/27,572,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848339,Whitney Houston's family wants to highlight her gospel roots,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Whitney Houston’s brother remembers when his young sister listened to their mother during gospel rehearsals before she mimicked every tune that was sung.As Houston rose to pop superstardom, her exceptionally talented vocals were rooted in gospel music. And now, her family — led by her sister-in-law Pat and brother Gary Houston — wants the foundation of her musical legacy to continue to live on through her new posthumous gospel album and documentary under the same name, “ I Go to the Rock: The Gospel Music of Whitney Houston. ”“Gospel was in her heart,” said Gary Houston, who recalled his sister around the age of 5 wearing their mother Cissy Houston’s wig and high heels while using a broom as a microphone. “We woke up to and went to sleep to gospel. She would sing exactly what she heard my mother and her siblings. No secular music. It was all gospel.”Pat Houston, the executor of Whitney Houston’s estate, said she’s excited for listeners to hear the six-time Grammy-winner’s message of hope and faith and the influential mark gospel music had on her life and career through both projects, which both were released Friday last week. The documentary, hosted by CeCe Winans, aired on UPtv and AspireTV and will be available on DVD.The singer’s 14-track album features several tunes from notable soundtracks including “Jesus Loves Me” from “The Bodyguard,” “His Eye Is on the Sparrow” from “Sparkle” along with “I Go to the Rock” and “Joy to the World” from “The Preacher’s Wife” soundtrack – the best-selling gospel album of all time. The project also includes six unreleased tracks – three of which (“He Can Use Me,” “I Found a Wonderful Way” and “Testimony”) were recorded when she was 17 years old.“You heard the innocence of her voice,” said Pat Houston. “You could see where she started and how she ended up with all her hits throughout her career. Any song is a great song of Whitney Houston’s. You heard her gospel roots all wrapped up in her music.”Whitney Houston first started singing at the New Hope Baptist Church in Newark, New Jersey, as a child. Between the mid-1980s to the late 1990s, she was one of the world’s best-selling artists with her effortlessly powerful vocals rooted in the Black church but made palatable to the masses with her pop persona.It understandably took time for the family to grieve after Whitney Houston’s death in 2012. Her brother, Gary, said he still feels his sister’s spirit whenever it rains, or when a bird visits him while he’s at home adding that “when the doorbell rings, I think it’s her.”But now, Gary and Pat Houston feel like they’re in a better place. That’s one of the reasons Pat felt now is the perfect time to release the gospel-centric projects — especially with Easter next month and Whitney Houston’s 60th birthday celebration on the horizon in August.“An Easter project is something she always wanted to do since her visit to Israel,” Pat Houston said. “It never came into fruition. We’re doing this all through Whitney’s lens. It’s special because this is her 60th birthday celebration. This project is definitely a labor of love for her. It represents her in such a very spiritual way.”Pat Houston said she hopes viewers can find closure through watching the documentary with several guest appearances including Jenifer Lewis, Kim Burrell and Kevin Costner. It features the singer's first-ever performance in front of an audience as well as many others including her singing “I Go to the Rock” with The Georgia Mass Choir on “Saturday Night Live” in 1996, “Jesus Loves Me” in Santiago, Chile, in 1994, and “Guide Me O Thou, Great Jehovah” on “The Arsenio Hall Show” in 1990.“Hopefully one could have peace and knowing that Whitney Houston was a woman of God,” she said. “No one is really exempt from the harsh realities of the world. She certainly understood that. But Whitney expressed her love for God. She knew where her strength was coming from and she showed it throughout the documentary.”",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848340,Bank of America signs on as new Boston Marathon sponsor,"BOSTON (AP) — The Boston Marathon has agreed to a 10-year sponsorship deal with Bank of America that organizers hope will allow the world’s oldest and most prestigious annual 26.2-mile road race to grow over the next decade while maintaining its historic character.Financial terms of the deal announced Monday were not disclosed. But the deal does not include the naming rights that typically allow the sponsor to boost its profile and an event to boost its coffers.“Why would you ever change a legacy? ... No, we’re not going to do that,” said David Tyrie, Bank of America’s chief digital officer and chief marketing officer. ""Everything you know and love about the Boston Marathon — and things that are around it — will continue. And then there’s going to be (an additional) 30% that we haven’t figured out yet that are going to be the taking it to the next level thing. And those are really exciting ones.”The bank already had a foot in the distance-running world as the sponsor of the Chicago Marathon for the last decade. Unlike that race, which is officially named the Bank of America Chicago Marathon, the Boston Marathon will keep its name, with the ""presented by Bank of America” tagline.“At some level we realized that Bank of America saw this differently,” Boston Athletic Association President and CEO Jack Fleming told The Associated Press. “They saw us as a different opportunity and maybe didn’t need to have that title and wanted to preserve it for everyone else. And for Boston.”First run in 1897 by 15 men who were inspired by the marathon race at the inaugural modern Olympics in Athens the previous spring, the Boston Marathon has grown into a weekend-long running festival and the signature event of the Massachusetts holiday known as Patriots’ Day. For 30,000 recreational runners who have to qualify just to line up in Hopkinton on the third Monday in April, it is a bucket-list event.The race remained an amateur competition — with runners competing for a gilded olive wreath and a bowl of beef stew — until 1986, when insurance giant John Hancock signed on as the main sponsor. The financial influx allowed the BAA to draw the top professional runners from around the world and offer a prize purse that is now approaching $1 million.But Hancock, a Boston institution since 1862, was acquired in 2004 by the Canadian insurance firm Manulife Financial. In September, the company announced it would not be renewing its sponsorship deal after 38 years.Within a month, the BAA was hearing from potential new sponsors. Fleming said the BAA was leery of the recent deals with crypto exchanges and other internet startups that evaporated when the sponsor went bankrupt.Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America stood out for its ability to see what made the race special.“We don’t do this very often. We don’t want to do this very often. We’ve only done this once prior,” Fleming said. “This is our next chapter.""The bank also has a large presence in Boston: The course runs past 11 Bank of America branches or ATMs — two of them on the final sprint down Boylston Street to the Copley Square finish line.“There’s an inherent appreciation for the uniqueness of the Boston Marathon,” Tyrie said. “We make sure that we have the best interest of the BAA, the marathon, its runners, its legacy (in mind). We make sure we really understand all of that.”Other events in connection with marathon weekend, including the charity bib program, the professional and para athlete fields and the weekend-long runner’s expo, are covered by the sponsorship deal and could take the Bank of America name. Tyrie said the company wants to raise the race's profile year-round, capitalizing on its experience in Chicago to bring new ideas to Boston.“There was never a strategy that says, ‘Hey, listen: We’re going to be the sponsor of choice for endurance sports,’” he said. “Chicago is run really well and we’ve been doing it for a while. ... We’ve got some pretty cool ideas that we’ve leveraged in Chicago. But it’s not really about taking a playbook.""“That’s Chicago,"" he said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848341,Report: Queen Elizabeth II asked Germany for pricey horses,"BERLIN (AP) — Two horses fit for a queen, please.That's what Britain's Queen Elizabeth II had asked for as a gift during her state visit to Germany in 1978, weekly Der Spiegel reported Monday.The expensive present raised eyebrows among German bureaucrats at the time, who noted that the cost of the Holsteiner and Gray horses was more than for any other offering made to a visiting head of state since the end of World War II.Nevertheless, Germany's then-President Walter Scheel approved the gift in the interests of good bilateral relations, Der Spiegel reported citing previously confidential archive papers.The magazine reported that the papers also noted the late monarch's aperitif preferences — gin and tonic — and dislike of helicopters.Records showed that the British embassy had concerns about possible protests if Elizabeth visited Dresden during her trip in 1992. In the end she did attend a church service and was largely welcomed by locals in the city that was flattened by Allied bombing raids during the war, Der Spiegel reported.Another sensitive issue during the trip was the question of whether Elizabeth would make a speech at the Bundestag. Der Spiegel reported that it was then-Chancellor Helmut Kohl who raised objections, possibly because of his lingering anger at Britain's efforts to block German reunification a few years earlier.In total, Elizabeth made five state visits to Germany, most recently in 2015, though only files older than 30 years were released.The report comes days before Elizabeth's son, King Charles III, makes his first state visit to Germany. The monarch was originally meant to visit France first, but plans for that trip were postponed due to anti-government protests in the country.Charles' three-day visit to Germany from Wednesday to Friday will include stops in Berlin, Brandenburg and Hamburg as part of a diplomatic outreach effort before his coronation on May 6. Unlike his mother, Charles will be permitted to speak before the Bundestag on Thursday.Britain's royal family has ancestral ties to Germany. Before changing its name to Windsor due to concerns about anti-German sentiment during World War I the family bore the name Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, indicating its German heritage.",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848342,Lebanon changes unpopular move to delay daylight saving time,"BEIRUT (AP) — Lebanon’s caretaker prime minister reversed an unpopular decision made by his office to delay the start of daylight saving time by a month, saying Monday the Cabinet decided to implement the change in two days.Najib Mikati’s comments came after the government’s initial decision earlier this month was widely criticized around the country with many, including the country’s largest church, saying they will not abide by the decision.“The new daylight saving time will start at midnight Wednesday,” Mikati said after a Cabinet meeting that only discussed the issue.With some institutions implementing the change while others refused, many Lebanese found themselves in the position of juggling work and school schedules in different time zones — in a country that is just 88 kilometers (55 miles) at its widest point.Last week, the government said it will delay the start of daylight saving time by a month until the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. That led to mass confusion in a country already experiencing the worst economic and financial crisis in its modern history.In some cases, the debate took on a sectarian nature, with many Christian politicians and institutions, including the small nation’s largest church, the Maronite Church, rejecting the move.The small Mediterranean country normally sets its clocks forward an hour on the last Sunday in March, which aligns with most European countries. However, on Thursday, the government announced a decision by Mikati to push the start of daylight saving to April 21.",2023/03/27,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848370,"Vrana, Kapanen, Blais in prove-it mode for rebuilding Blues","Breathing through 25 stitches in his nose, Jakub Vrana beamed about his fresh start with the St. Louis Blues.“I’m really happy to be here, to start all over again with a new team,” he said.The Blues are happy to have him, courtesy of a trade from Detroit. They're also glad to have Kasperi Kapanen after plucking him off waivers from Pittsburgh and to get Sammy Blais back from the deal that sent Vladimir Tarasenko to the New York Rangers.Vrana, Kapanen and Blais are all players signed only through next year who are trying to show they deserve major jobs in the NHL. St. Louis sold at the trade deadline and is out of the playoff race, but the early returns from those three are a good start to turning things around and winning again as soon as next year.“It’s a new life for them, and they want to prove themselves, so they’re hungry players,” coach Craig Berube said. “So far they’ve been pretty good for us. Hopefully they continue to grow and get to the level they (had) once been.”Blais, a 2014 Blues draft pick and a valuable depth player when they won the Stanley Cup in 2019, has 15 points in his first 22 games back from the New York Rangers. Kapanen has 10 points in his first 14 games, while Vrana scored six goals in his first 11.They've been doing it thanks to more opportunities. Blais was playing less than 10 minutes a game with the Rangers, Kapanen's role with the Penguins was inconsistent and Vrana played in just five games for the Red Wings sandwiched around his stint in the NHL/NHLPA Player Assistance Program.Asked if he thought he needed a change of scenery, Vrana responded: “Detroit thinks that for sure, right? So, I accept it and I’m happy for it.”So are his new teammates who got the same.“It’s been feeling good being back here and finding my confidence back a little bit,” said Blais, who has more points since his return to St. Louis than he did in 54 games with New York, which included a lengthy absence because of a torn ACL in his right knee. “It's been really good since I've been back here: finding my game, my legs and just got to keep looking forward and playing with confidence.”Confidence is slowly coming back for Kapanen, like Vrana now with his third NHL organization. A first-round pick of Toronto's in 2014, Kapanen signed a $6.4 million, two-year deal with Pittsburgh just last summer before finding himself the odd man out, on waivers and changing teams midseason in February.It may be the best thing to happen to the son of longtime Finnish forward Sami Kapanen.“I still have room to improve, but I think it's heading in the right direction,” Kasperi Kapanen said. “It’s a new start for me, so I’m excited. It’s a great team, and the guys have been really making me feel comfortable, which is awesome. When you feel at ease, I think everything comes easier.”Vrana is playing more at ease than he has since his early pro years with the Washington Capitals, whom he helped win the Cup in 2018. A 2021 trade to Detroit for Anthony Mantha did not work out for either team, and Vrana never found his groove with the Red Wings and eventually fell out of favor with management.Berube praised Vrana's skill and speed and said it'll take some time for the 27-year-old Czech winger to figure out his all-around game. But thanks to the Blues' approach to take a step back this season with an eye on getting right back into contention, he, Kapanen and Blais all have plenty of chances to prove their future value.“Guys who have stuff to prove have a little bit more pressure on themselves,” veteran forward Robert Thomas said. “And they put it on themselves. It’s always nice to see those guys succeed and keep on pushing for more.”___Follow AP Hockey Writer Stephen Whyno on Twitter at https://twitter.com/SWhyno___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/27,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848371,Supreme Court to hear lawsuit involving disability activist,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court will decide whether a disabled activist can file disability rights lawsuits against hotels she doesn't intend to visit.The high court said Monday it would decide a case involving Deborah Laufer. Laufer, who lives in Florida, has filed over 600 federal lawsuits against hotel owners and operators, according to a Supreme Court filing.Laufer has a vision impairment, uses a cane or wheelchair to get around, and has limited use of her hands, according to court documents. Her lawsuits contend that the websites of accommodations, generally small hotels and bed-and-breakfasts, are not clear enough about whether they are accessible to people with disabilities.Under the federal Americans With Disabilities Act hotels must identify and describe their accessible features including guest rooms in sufficient detail.Laufer's lawsuits and lawsuits by other self-appointed “testers” have divided federal appeals courts. The question is whether Laufer and others have suffered an injury that gives them the ability to sue, called “standing.” Some courts have ruled that people who never intend to visit the accommodations they are challenging can nonetheless sue. Other courts have declined to allow the lawsuits.The case the court agreed to hear involves the Coast Village Inn and Cottages in Wells, Maine. A federal trial court dismissed Laufer's lawsuit alleging the hotel's website contained insufficient information on disability accommodations. But a federal appeals court allowed the case to go forward.The hotel currently has a notice at the top of its website that reads: “Please Note: Unfortunately, we do not have the capabilities to provide pet-friendly or ADA compliant lodging. We apologize for the inconvenience!”",2023/03/27,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848372,Fleming stars as `Nixon in China' arrives at Paris Opera,"PARIS (AP) — After spending decades portraying generals' wives, a countess and a courtesan, Renée Fleming walked gingerly onto the stage of the Bastille Opera in a blond wig, red coat and black gloves to depict Pat Nixon, former first lady of the United States.John Adams’ “Nixon in China,” a 1987 work among the most acclaimed American operas, received its Paris Opera premiere on Saturday night to eight minutes of applause following a revelatory production by Argentine director Valentina Carrasco that replaced literalism with metaphor. The lasting images were of a dark American eagle pitted against a bright red Chinese dragon and of ping-pong tables symbolizing both diplomacy and the quest for superiority.“You really have to be in your mid-60s to even remember this other than as it’s something that you learn about in school,” said Fleming, a 64-year-old soprano who bid farewell to the standard repertory six years ago. “I’m sorry, but in the context of what’s going on now, Watergate doesn’t seem quite as horrific as it did at the time.”Thomas Hampson, a 67-year-old American baritone, starred as President Richard Nixon, complete with hunched shoulders and a sweaty face he repeatedly dabbed with a white handkerchief. Hampson broke out Nixon’s stiff V-for-victory motion with arms outstretched during curtain calls.Hampson was a high school senior in Spangle, Washington, when Nixon made the seven-day trip to China in 1972, the first visit by an American president following the 1949 communist revolution.“The whole effort of an American president to just simply shake hands across the globe was extremely impressive,” Hampson said. “Nixon will always and forever be Watergate. But there are parts of the presidency of Richard Nixon and parts of Richard Nixon that we just have to parse out and respect for what it is.”Adams, now 76, made the trip from his California home and signed autographs during intermission, then joined the curtain calls. He wrote the opera with librettist Alice Goodman.“They are larger-than-life characters. They created these personae, as most politicians do, but between Mao and Kissinger and Madam Mao and Nixon, they’re kind of political archetypes and I think that just captures the public imagination,” he said.“Nixon” launched at the Houston Grand Opera with realistic sets by Peter Sellars that were reproduced for the 2011 Metropolitan Opera premiere. The Paris Opera became the first major European house to stage it, and “Nixon” debuts at Madrid’s Teatro Real on April 17 in a John Fulljames staging that first appeared at the Royal Danish Opera in 2019.Fleming was making her Santa Fe Opera debut on a rainy night in August 2019 when company artistic director Alexander Neef approached her with an idea.“He said, `I’m going to Paris and I want you to come for the first three of my seasons,'” Fleming recalled Neef saying of his job starting in 2021-22. “I was sort of shocked and said, `Well, let me see what I can think of that I could sing.’”Carrasco, now 49, was living in Rome in 2020 and rushed to see the monument Ara Pacis Augustae after an impending pandemic closure was announced. While walking in, she received a call from Neef asking her to stage “Nixon.”“I thought it was a sign,” Carrasco saidShe had a flash to a childhood memory of seeing “From Mao to Mozart,” a film with violinist Isaac Stern that won the 1981 Academy Award for best documentary feature. A segment stuck in her head in which Stern gives a master class and tells a student to swing her instrument while playing as if swinging a ping-pong paddle.“Ping-pong is good because it’s like a terrain divided in two, like the Cold War, an Iron Curtain in-between,” Carrasco said. “It’s a winner-loser situation, and I thought it was an interesting metaphor for the world. And Ping-Pong is a very beautiful choreographic for a visual. And the tiktok, tiktok, tiktok of the ping-pong ball reminded me of many places where the music is very percussive. And then, of course, there was Ping-Pong Diplomacy.”Gustavo Dudamel conducts a strong cast that includes Xiaomeng Zhang as Chou En-lai, Joshua Bloom as Henry Kissinger, John Matthew Myers as Mao Tse-Tung and Kathleen Kim as Madame Mao. There are seven more performances through April 16, and the April 7 show will be streamed in France and aired later on Medici and Mezzo.Carrasco splits the stage in two levels early on, scenes of diplomacy on top and torture on the bottom.Kissinger plays table tennis against Chou, each dressed like a wrestler entering a ring. Chou wins the match 69-1 — China repeatedly cheats by not crediting Kissinger with points he won. Carrasco had tried 49-3 during a rehearsal, using the numbers for the French constitution article that allowed the retirement age to be lowered without French Assembly approval.A clip of the Stern film is shown between the second and third acts.Fleming prepared by speaking with former Nixon aide Frank Gannon and reading Will Swift’s “Pat and Dick: The Nixons, an Intimate Portrait of a Marriage.”“I didn’t know he was funny. I never would have guessed that,” Fleming said. “I didn’t know anything about her. So all of this material is really interesting. She was fiercely protective of him and of her children.”",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848373,UN-backed probe cites crimes against humanity in Libya,"GENEVA (AP) — U.N.-backed human rights experts said Monday there is evidence that crimes against humanity have been committed against Libyans and migrants in chaos-stricken Libya, including women being forced into sexual slavery.The investigators commissioned by the U.N.-backed Human Rights Council also faulted the European Union for sending support to Libyan forces that they say contributed to crimes against migrants and Libyans, and called on EU authorities to review their policies toward Libya.The findings come in an extensive new report, based on interviews with hundreds of people, including migrants and witnesses, that wraps up a fact-finding mission created nearly three years ago to investigate rights violations and abuses in the North African country. The mission shared its findings with the International Criminal Court.Oil-rich but largely lawless Libya has in recent years emerged as the dominant transit point for migrants seeking a better quality of life in Europe. A ctivists have long decried horrible conditions faced by migrants who were trafficked and smuggled across the Mediterranean.Spokespersons for the government in the capital of Tripoli, which works in western Libya, and the forces of a powerful commander that controls eastern and southern Libya, were not immediately available for comment.The investigators found “reasonable grounds to believe that crimes against humanity were committed against Libyans and migrants throughout Libya,” said Mohamed Auajjar, the head of the fact-finding mission. Speaking in Arabic through a translator at a news conference in Geneva, he said his team unearthed ""numerous cases of arbitrary detention, murder, torture, rape, enslavement, sexual enslavement and enforced disappearance.”The Libyan coast guard, which has received training and equipment from the EU, has worked “in close coordination"" with trafficking networks in Libya, the report said. The “wide-scale exploitation of vulnerable, irregular migrants” churned up “significant revenue” that spurred continued rights violations, it said.“The support given by the EU to the Libyan coast guard in terms of pull-backs, pushbacks, (and) interceptions led to violations of certain human rights,"" said investigator Chaloka Beyani. ""You can’t push back people to areas that are unsafe, and the Libyan waters are unsafe for the embarkation of migrants.”He said the European bloc and its member states weren't found to be responsible for war crimes, but ""the support given has aided and abetted the commission of the crimes.”European Commission spokesman Peter Stano told reporters Monday that the EU did not fund the Libyan coast guard “nor any other entity in Libya,” adding that the EU assistance was meant to “improve their performance.”“We are providing assistance to help them improve their performance when it comes to search and rescue, be it with vessels, be it with equipment, or previously training with a focus exactly on human rights,” he said.The investigators documented enslavement, rape — “at times at gunpoint” — and other sexual abuse against women and men, including by guards working both for state authorities and trafficking groups.Investigators cited evidence of crimes against humanity in prisons in parts of eastern Libya controlled by forces of commander Khalifa Hifter, as well as in areas controlled by an umbrella group of militias led by Abdel-Ghani al-Kikli, an infamous warlord known as “Gheniwa” in the capital, Tripoli.The U.N. migration agency, in its latest report published in mid-March, tallied nearly 700,000 migrants with 42 nationalities in Libya as of the end of last year. The investigators said the situation of human rights has been getting worse.“The mission’s mandate is ending when the human rights situation in Libya is deteriorating, parallel State authorities are emerging, and the legislative, executive and security sector reforms needed to uphold the rule of law and unify the country are far from being realized,” it said.Libya was plunged into turmoil after a NATO-backed uprising in 2011 toppled longtime autocrat Moammar Gadhafi, who was later killed, and left the country divided between rival governments on the east and west. The United Nations has been struggling to try to shepherd the country toward new elections.The International Criminal Court has an ongoing investigation in Libya that was originally called for by the U.N. Security Council during the upheaval that led to Gadhafi’s ouster. In November, ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan said his office had joined a coalition of nations investigating human trafficking in the country.___Magdy reported from Cairo.

Police have said that the 17-year-old was shot after he broke into a home in Edmond and attacked two officers. They have said that a stun gun had no effect on him.Lewis' lawyers wrote that on the day he was shot he had inadvertently smoked marijuana laced with PCP. His parents argued that he was experiencing a mental health crisis and that police used excessive force.An autopsy report found Lewis suffered a total of four gunshot wounds to his face, thighs and groin.A federal trial court judge had allowed the lawsuit against the officer who shot Lewis to go forward, but a three-judge panel of the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver reversed that ruling.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848375,European clubs seal FIFA deal to increase World Cup revenue,"GENEVA (AP) — European soccer clubs sealed a new working agreement with FIFA on Monday after securing a 70% increase in their share of World Cup revenues for the 2026 and 2030 tournaments.The European Club Association said it renewed its working accord with FIFA through 2030, which also could lead to clubs having a say in managing commercial deals for the revamped Club World Cup that is scheduled to start in 2025.Part of the agreement, which missed a target to be signed in December at the World Cup in Qatar, ensures clubs worldwide will share $355 million of FIFA’s income from each of the next two editions of the men’s World Cup. FIFA conservatively budgeted to earn at least $11 billion from 2023-26.Clubs shared $209 million from each of the 2018 and 2022 tournaments, with money paid on a daily rate for the time players spent away with their national teams.The 70% raise from FIFA coincides with a 50% increase in the number of players at the 2026 World Cup, which will be the first with 48 teams instead of 32.The “Memorandum of Understanding” was agreed to on the sidelines of the ECA biannual assembly in Budapest, Hungary. It was brokered by ECA chairman Nasser al-Khelaïfi, the Qatari president of Paris Saint-Germain, and FIFA president Gianni Infantino.The deal promises some stability in the often volatile world of soccer politics, and should bind clubs into respecting the FIFA-managed calendar of national team games and tournaments.The calendar, which mandates when clubs must release players who are selected for national team squads, was confirmed and extended by FIFA at meetings in Rwanda two weeks ago.FIFA and the ECA will work together on a revamped, 32-team Club World Cup to be played every four years starting in 2025. Securing cooperation with Europe was essential to its launch with 12 European teams taking part.The format, broadcasting and sponsorship details for the tournament have yet to be decided.Al-Khelaïfi said talks with FIFA were planned “on potential structures for managing the commercial rights going forward.”Real Madrid and Chelsea already earned their places in the 2025 Club World Cup as the Champions League winners in the past two seasons. The next two Champions League winners also will get places. UEFA's ranking of European clubs will decide other entries with a national quota of two teams.The ECA was created in 2008 in a peace deal with FIFA and UEFA that shut down the elite G-14 group of storied clubs and pending legal cases. The new group got recognition in exchange for giving clubs a more democratic voice and with payments from World Cup and European Championship tournament revenues.The ECA membership is set to grow from about 240 to 330, Al-Khelaïfi said on Monday, with around 100 more clubs affiliated at a lower tier. Executive board seats are also being promised to women's clubs.Those moves follow a potential challenge to ECA's status as sole representation for teams from the Union of European Clubs. It announced a launch last year to give more voice to lower-level clubs.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848376,College athlete influencers confront security concerns,"Making TikTok videos for fun evolved into a serious moneymaking venture for Nebraska track athlete Jess Gardner, who is among the many social media stars in college sports.A comical video of her teaching a football player how to pole vault has been viewed nearly 4 million times, though the majority of her self-described “girly girl” content features her lip-syncing or performing skits while dressed in her track uniform, sweat clothes or stylish outfits. Pretty common stuff for social media influencers.The number of Gardner's TikTok followers has climbed to nearly 210,000 over the past four months — in addition to her 115,000 on Instagram — and with that has come something else: Gardner has become mindful of staying safe because of the possibility of an overzealous fan becoming menacing; she said eight of every 10 of her followers are male.As has been the case with other female athletes who are monetizing their social media followings, it's typical for her looks to be the subject of comments on her videos, comments that can range from genuinely complimentary to inappropriate — or worse.“As a woman, thinking in the future, if I had a son and they were commenting those kinds of things on a young girl’s video, I would be ashamed of my son,” Gardner said. ""Not all the comments are like that. Don’t get me wrong. There are a lot of very nice people who follow me, a lot of very nice comments.“But some of the ones that are more alarming, like I just think, what is going on in your life? I can’t take it personal,"" she said. ""I have to understand their perception of me is a reflection of their experiences and their life and that type of stuff. What happened or what’s going on that you see a video of me in a winter coat and that’s where your mind is going?”LSU gymnast Olivia Dunne, who has 11 million TikTok and Instagram followers, was in the headlines earlier this year when a swarm of boys and young men showed up at a meet in Utah. They at one point formed a gauntlet outside the arena. Dunne later asked her fans to show respect for her and her teammates, and the incident prompted LSU to assign security personnel to travel with the team.John Muffler of Florida-based Aequitas Global Security said athletes who have experienced sudden popularity as influencers must understand they are at risk of attracting followers with nefarious intentions. Muffler, a retired U.S. Marshals Service chief inspector, specializes in risk mitigation and threat assessment and has written about problems influencers can encounter.As with all influencers, Muffler said, college athletes with rising public profiles need to be aware of their surroundings and never post anything that would offer a clue about their location.Muffler discourages sending direct messages to followers the influencer does not know and urges caution in general replies to comments. Something as innocent as a smiley face emoji could trigger what's known as a parasocial relationship, meaning the follower imagines he or she knows or is friends with the influencer.“Most people are going to be fine and normal about following you,” Muffler said, “but it can be perceived as an invitation to others — and those are the ones you need to worry about. They’re the ones that show up in your lab class or outside your dorm.”Hanna Cavinder, who along with sister and fellow Miami basketball player Haley are among the top college athlete influencers by any measure, said she lives a more private life than most would assume given the twins' prolific and lucrative use of social media.“People will always question, ‘Well, why don’t you post your teammates more on TikTok? Or why aren’t you posting your sisters more or your family and stuff?’” she added. “And this is why — I don’t want them to deal with stuff that we’ve had to learn and grow and adapt to, like hate comments and stuff like that. That took a while to get used to, people just talking down on you for no reason.”Gardner said she started making TikToks last year with her roommate and they were surprised at how many views they generated. With college athletes now able to cash in on their celebrity, Gardner began looking for ways to monetize them and now partners with about 15 brands, most of them catering to women.Her potential annual earnings from the effort are projected to be $111,000, which ranks No. 3 among Division I female track athletes, according to On3.com.Gardner said she has received handwritten letters signed by men — one contained jokers from a deck of cards — and thrown them away. She had heard about the Dunne situation in Utah but didn't give it much thought until a teammate told her a group of males was looking for her during an indoor meet in Lincoln.“That kind of stuff ... is definitely scary,” she said during an interview in Nebraska's indoor track facility. “As you can see in this building, we’re a little less separated than the basketball or football or volleyball team would be at a game. The stands are right there. That was definitely unsettling.”Gardner said she spoke with her coaches and people in the athletic department who said they were aware of her large social media following and assured her security measures were in place to keep her safe.University spokeswoman Leslie Reed said campus police have not seen an increase in athlete security concerns directly attributable to social media prominence.“We have always had high-profile athletes on the University of Nebraska-Lincoln campus and we address issues as they arise,” Reed said in a statement.___AP Basketball Writer Tim Reynolds contributed to this report.___AP college sports: https://apnews.com/hub/college-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/27,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848377,"In Trump probe, key witness returns, no indictment vote yet","NEW YORK (AP) — A pivotal figure in the hush money payment investigation of Donald Trump returned on Monday to the building where a grand jury has been meeting for months, a repeat appearance suggesting his testimony could be key as prosecutors push toward potential criminal charges.There was still no word on when the panel might vote on a possible indictment of the former president.David Pecker, a longtime Trump friend and the former chief executive of the parent company of The National Enquirer, was back as the grand jury heard testimony in the probe for the first time since last Monday, when a witness favorable to the ex-president appeared.The grand jury is now back on the Trump matter, according to a person familiar with the case who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss secretive proceedings. The ex-president is being investigated over payments during his 2016 campaign to two women who alleged affairs or sexual encounters with him.Trump denies being involved with either of the women, porn actor Stormy Daniels and model Karen McDougal, and claims he's the victim of “extortion.”Among the witnesses the grand jury has already heard from is Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and fixer who has said he orchestrated the payoffs. Cohen pleaded guilty in 2018 to federal charges arising from the payments and has become a potentially major witness for state prosecutors.Pecker is seen as relevant to the investigation because his company, American Media Inc., secretly assisted Trump’s campaign by paying $150,000 to McDougal in August 2016 for the rights to her story about an alleged affair with Trump. The company then suppressed McDougal’s story until after the election, a dubious journalism practice known as “catch-and-kill.”Cohen made recordings of a conversation in which he and Trump spoke about the arrangement to pay McDougal through the tabloid publisher.At one point in the recording, Cohen told Trump, “I need to open up a company for the transfer of all of that info regarding our friend, David,” a reference to Pecker.Cohen told Trump that he had already spoken with the Trump Organization’s longtime finance chief, Allen Weisselberg, on “how to set the whole thing up.”Trump then said: “What do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?”Cohen also signed an agreement to buy the nondisclosure part of McDougal’s contract with AMI for $125,000 through a company he formed called Resolution Consultants LLC, but a few months later Pecker told Cohen that the deal was off and Cohen never paid the $125,000, according to court documents from Cohen's criminal case.Separately, Cohen has admitted to paying $130,000 to Daniels to keep her from telling her story to the Enquirer or some other media.Trump has said that he personally, not his company, reimbursed Cohen.Federal prosecutors revealed in 2018 that they had agreed not to bring criminal charges against AMI. Pecker has since stepped down as CEO.Trump raised anticipation that criminal charges were imminent with a March 18 post on his social media platform in which he said he expected to be arrested last Tuesday. He has since used the absence of an indictment to claim, furnishing no evidence, that the investigation is somehow faltering.The Republican former president has also escalated his rhetoric, warning that “potential death & destruction"" would accompany any indictment. He also posted a photo of himself holding a baseball bat next to a picture of District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat. On Thursday, Trump referred to Bragg, Manhattan’s first Black D.A., as an “animal.”In a memo to staff Friday, Bragg thanked the nearly 1,600 people for persevering in the face of “additional press attention and security around our office“ and said their safety remains the top priority.“We will continue to apply the law evenly and fairly, which is what each of you does every single day,” Bragg wrote.Since then, former federal prosecutors in New York City have rallied to Bragg's defense, signing a letter that condemned the verbal attacks.“As former prosecutors, we denounce efforts to intimidate the Manhattan District Attorney and we call upon all to support and protect prosecutorial independence and the rule of law,” he said.____Associated Press writer Bobby Caina Calvan contributed to this report.More on Donald Trump-related investigations: https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump",2023/03/28,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848411,Taiwanese tourist fined for sporting skimpy string bikini in Boracay,"A Taiwanese woman has sparked controversy in the Philippines after she was spotted on the country’s resort island of Boracay sporting a super skimpy bikini.On Wednesday and Thursday (Oct. 9-10), the female tourist was spotted with her boyfriend strutting around the beaches of Boracay wearing an outrageous outfit that left virtually nothing to the imagination. She was spotted on Wednesday wearing a white bikini that consisted of only slender strips of cloth covering her private parts, while she chose to don a red version of the outfit on Thursday.Local Filipinos, who were aghast at her indecent public exhibition, rapidly shared photos of the woman’s racy outfit on social media. The social media photos then drew the attention of the Boracay Inter-Agency Rehabilitation Management Group on Wednesday, which called on police to track down the tawdry tourist.Police managed to identify the hotel where the Taiwanese couple was staying, and at 5:30 p.m. on Thursday, police arrested the woman on charges of violating a municipal ordinance on indecency, reported Panay News. When questioned by police, the couple claimed to be “models.”The woman told police that she was “just expressing herself” and claimed that she did not know she was violating any laws, saying this was the way she normally dressed on beaches in Taiwan, reported The Philippine Star. Municipality of Malay Police Chief Maj. Jess Baylon described her outfit as “literally just a string.”Baylon cited the woman as saying “I’m confident about myself.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848427,Florence invites Floridians to see pornographic Michelangelo,"Florence Mayor Dario Naardella has invited parents, students and a teacher fired from the Tallahassee Classical School in Florida to come to Italy and judge firsthand whether Michelangelo Buonarroti's 1504 sculpture of the Old Testament hero David is in fact pornography.The invitation was extended after the school's principal, Hope Carrasquilla, was forced to resign when parents vociferously complained about images of the five-meter (17 foot) tall marble sculpture being shown to sixth graders as part of a Renaissance art history course.Two parents complained they had not been warned their children would be shown the image, while a third called it ""pornographic.""On Saturday, Mayor Nardella tweeted, ""to mistake art for pornography is just ridiculous.""Nardella's invitation came after Cecilie Hollberg, director of the city's famed Galleria dell'Accademia, extended a similar offer to the principal, school board, parents and student body in order for them to witness the ""purity"" of the statue.Over the weekend, Hollberg was quoted by Italy's La Repubblica newspaper saying, ""to think that David could be pornographic means truly not understanding the contents of the Bible, not understanding Western culture and not understanding Renaissance art.""Hollberg went on to say it takes a ""warped imagination"" to associate a religious figure with pornography.The sculpture is one of the premiere works of the Italian Renaissance, famed for its representation of a perfect human figure created by god.In Michelangelo's portrait of David, the Biblical slayer of Philistine giant Goliath is seen naked — in classical Renaissance contrapposto — with a stone in his right hand and a sling over his left shoulder.Created between 1501 and 1504, the sculpture is one of the main draws to the museum, which sees 1.7 million visitors each year — many of them selfie-hungry American tourists who pose before it.Hope Carrasquilla said she was ""very honored"" by the invitation, adding, ""I've been to Florence before and have seen the David up close and in person, but I would love to go and be a guest of the mayor.""The Tallahassee Classical School is a so-called charter school, meaning it is taxpayer funded and tuition free but can set its own curriculum — unlike public schools that must follow specific state academic guidelines.The school, attended by some 400 student from kindergarten through grade 12, was founded three years ago and follows a curriculum set by Hillsdale College in Michigan.Hillsdale, an ultra-conservative Christian school, has become a go-to partner for, among others, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who has declared a war on what he describes as ""woke liberalism"" in the state.The issue of ""parental rights"" in schools has gained traction among Republican politicians, their donors and their base, proving to be a popular fundraising and electoral lightning rod as well as one that garners headlines in the right's crusade against the teaching of issues they disapprove of, such as examinations of race history in the US and anything related to sex or gender identity.DeSantis, who is largely seen as a potential Republican presidential candidate, has vowed to reform Florida's schools and universities to make them a model for others in the country to follow — replacing directors and staff deemed too liberal with conservative allies, banning the teaching of topics like race and sex education, and culling thousands of books from school libraries and state curricula.Addressing the controversy over Carrasquilla's firing, Tallahassee Classical School Board Chairman Barney Bishop said it was about more than the image of the sculpture but did not elaborate.Other parents from the school have said they plan to defend Carrasquilla at an upcoming school board meeting though the educator said she was unsure whether she would even be interested in getting her job back at this point: ""There's been such controversy and such upheaval. I would really have to consider, is this truly what is best?""Speaking to the issue from the American Academy in Rome, humanities professor Marla Stone said she was perplexed that a lesson on Renaissance art would require a trigger warning: ""What we have here is a moral crusade against the body, sexuality, and gender expression and an ignorance of history. The incident is about fear — fear of beauty, of difference, and of the possibilities embedded in art.""js/jcg (AP, dpa)",2023/03/27,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848428,North Korean girls exploited in China's 'Red Zone' – report,"Around half a million female North Koreans, some as young as 12, are hiding in border regions of China, according to a new report by an international human rights law firm Global Rights Compliance. Activists warn that women and girls remain at critical risk of exploitation even after fleeing their homeland.Working with multiple NGOs and human rights organizations to comply evidence and testimony from refugees, Global Rights Compliance found over 4,340 documented cases of human trafficking of North Korean women from China in the last decade and at least 80,000 reported abuses of human rights.Sofia Evangelou, the law firm's lead legal advisor on North Korean human rights and global rights compliance, said many accounts are harrowing to read.""I have read some of the testimony and I find myself staggered and very moved at what these women have gone through,"" Evangelou told DW.""Many of these women, even after they have reached safety in South Korea, say they are still suffering from feelings of anxiety, of shame, or post-traumatic stress disorder,"" she said.""Each of these women has had a different experience and is coping with it in their own way, but there is a clear pattern of women suffering physically, emotionally and psychologically as a result of their experiences.""The report states the women are not safe even after completing the perilous journey over North Korea's heavily fortified border with China — where Pyongyang has introduced a shoot-to-kill order for anyone suspected of attempting to flee the country.They are still forced to hide after reaching the so-called ""Red Zone"" in eastern China, as the Chinese authorities hunt defectors before sending them back to the North. Reports suggest that first-time escapees can get away with a spell in one of the North's brutal prisons, although the punishment for repeat offenders can be far more serious, including execution.Lockdowns introduced on the Chinese side of the border to try to halt the spread of the coronavirus has made the situation even more risky. Typically, the defectors have little money, no access to food and cannot continue their journey to safety in a third country.Data gathered from defectors by groups such as the Database Center for North Korean Human Rights and the Transitional Justice Working Group indicates that as many as 80% of female North Korean refugees fall into the hands of people traffickers and are sold into sex trade, which is estimated to generate more than $105 million (€97.5 million) a year for Chinese and North Korean organized crime networks.Within the Red Zone, women and girls are reportedly often subjected to systematic rape, sexual slavery, forced marriage, unwanted pregnancy, forced labor and cybersex trafficking. Such mistreatment has become ""normalized” in the region, the report claims, with women beaten in public and being sold for as little as a few hundred dollars.""I was sold to a Han Chinese living in Yanbian,"" one woman said in her testimony, according to the report. ""We lived together for one year and we couldn't have a child, so he beat me. He kicked me. He kicked my head a lot.""A woman who was caught and sent to a prison in North Korea witnessed another prisoner, who was concealing her pregnancy, collapse while she was performing hard labor collecting rocks from a river. She drowned, but when guards realized she had been pregnant they stripped all the other female inmates naked to check for more hidden pregnancies. They then carried out immediate forced abortions, according to the account gathered by the activists.""A black hole of information currently exists around China's Red Zone, which means that many more North Korean women and girls are falling victims to China's sex slave industry,"" said Evangelou. ""The​​ current situation leaves North Korean women and girls exposed to the stark reality of either being sold into a lifetime of sexual and mental abuse, slavery, forced labor, or reaching freedom.""Evangelou urged the end of the ""pandemic of international silence"" on the issue.""The illegal sexual slavery of women and girls will not stop until a​concerted ​international effort is mobilized,"" she added. ""The international community can no longer turn a blind eye to the atrocities being committed against women and children, fleeing for their lives and — in too many cases — those of their unborn children.""Meanwhile, the government of South Korea seems to be growing more interested in Pyongyang's human rights violations and holding the leaders of the isolated state accountable.Park Jung-won, a professor of international Law at Dankook University, said the previous South Korean administration of President Moon Jae-in was ""silent on the situation around human rights abuses in the North,"" but that tides are shifting under President Yoon Suk-yeol.""There has been a significant change in the attitude of the government and South Korea this month jointly sponsored a United Nations draft resolution on human rights in the North, for the first time in five years,"" he said, pointing out that Yoon has also appointed a new ambassador to promote human rights in North Korea.""This is a complete change from before and a very positive thing for human rights in the North,"" he said. ""I am hopeful that this government will continue to push on this matter, raising questions at the UN and other international forums to increase the pressure on Pyongyang.""The pressure from Seoul will ""enable the international community to take more concrete action to respond to these terrible human rights abuses in the North and this very dangerous border zone,"" Park added.Edited by: Darko Janjevic",2023/03/27,,

He has previously called for a zone of protection to be set up around the facility to prevent any such incidents and has criticized Russian forces for stationing military vehicles and personnel on site.Here are some of the other notable developments concerning the war in Ukraine on Monday, March 27:The Kremlin said on Monday it would not change its plan to base nuclear weapons in neighboring Belarus, despite criticism from the West.After Russian President Vladimir Putin announced on Saturday that Russia would station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, the European Union said Minsk could face further sanctions while Ukraine pushed to hold an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council.""Such a reaction of course cannot influence Russian plans,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Monday.The powerful secretary of the Kremlin Security Council, Nikolai Patrushev, also said on Monday that Russia has the weapons to destroy any enemy, including the United States, if its existence is threatened.During a televised interview on Sunday, Putin said the deal with Belarus was ""nothing unusual” and would not breach ""our international agreements on nuclear non-proliferation.”""The United States has been doing this for decades. They have long placed their tactical nuclear weapons on the territory of their allies,"" Putin said.US National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said on Sunday that the US hasn't seen any indication that Russia intends to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine.Ukrainian crews training to use the British Challenger 2 main battle tanks have completed their training which began in January, the UK government said on Monday.The Ministry of Defense said the Ukrainian solders ""have returned home to continue their fight against Russia's illegal and unprovoked invasion.""""It is truly inspiring to witness the determination of Ukrainian soldiers having completed their training on British Challenger 2 tanks on British soil,"" Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said.""They return to their homeland better equipped but to no less danger. We will continue to stand by them and do all we can to support Ukraine for as long as it takes.""A police chief in the Russian-occupied city of Mariupol survived a car bomb assassination attempt on Monday, Russian state media reported.The TASS news agency reported that he only sustained a ""light injury,” citing an anonymous source.Putin made a surprise visit to Mariupol earlier this month. Russian authorities have attempted to present Mariupol as relatively safe.A Russian diplomat said on Monday that Moscow may seek compensation over damage to the Nord Stream gas pipelines last September, without naming any specific country.""We do not rule out later raising the issue of compensation for damage as a result of the explosion,"" Dmitry Birichevsky, head of the Foreign Ministry's department for economic cooperation, said in an interview with RIA Novosti.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has accused state actor of being responsible and said Russia would establish who was behind the blasts before claiming any compensation.""You see that Western countries are taking all possible measures to cover up this issue ... But Russia will do everything possible to prevent this from happening,"" he said.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and British actor and UNICEF ambassador Orlando Bloom have highlighted the plight of millions of children caught up in the war in Ukraine in a new video shared to social media.Bloom said in a meeting with Zelenskyy that he had visited a family with five children of their own as well as four adopted war orphans.""Children in Ukraine need to get their childhood back,"" Bloom said.He also addressed the fate of the ""missing children” who were taken to Russia and referred to the Russian president as a ""war criminal” without using his name.Zelenskyy added that the war is ""destroying the childhood of Ukrainian children, "" adding that some 2.7 million Ukrainian children are still forced to learn online.zc,ab/jcg (AP, Reuters, AFP, dpa)",2023/03/27,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848430,'Measures of Men' sheds light on German colonial crimes,"Almost 120 years ago, the Herero people rose up against German colonial rule in German Southwest Africa, what is now called Namibia.The German military commander, General Lothar von Trotha, suppressed the uprising ruthlessly and issued a notorious ""extermination order,"" which led to what has gone down in the history books as the ""first genocide of the 20th century.""With ""Der vermessene Mensch"" (Measures of Men), German director Lars Kraume has directed the first German feature film dealing with the issue.In the movie, a fictional young German ethnologist embarks on a research trip to the colony German South West Africa and begins collecting human skulls for his so-called ""racial research."" In the process, he witnesses the genocide committed by the ""Deutsche Schutztruppe,"" as the military formation that maintained the German Empire was called, against the Ovaherero and Nama tribes between 1904 and 1908. But beyond witnessing the crimes, the ethnologist increasingly mutates into a perpetrator.The story is about the ""moral decay"" of its main protagonist, Kraume tells DW. As a German director, he felt it would not be right to tell the story from the perspective of the Ovaherero and Nama. But some critics disagree on the angle with which Kraume approached the film.The very first scene of the film makes one shudder. Berlin scientists are measuring skulls of German and African skeletons in a lecture hall of Berlin's Friedrich Wilhelm University, now Humboldt University. A pseudo-scientific, evolutionist racial theory is taught, based on the premise that the skull of a ""Berlin worker"" is larger than that of an African ""bushman."" These comparisons are meant to prove that Germans are supposedly ""more intelligent"" than Africans — a theory that prevailed during the colonial era, and long after as well.Kraume succeeds in capturing the zeitgeist of the time through these abstruse investigations.The ambitious ethnology doctoral student Alexander Hoffmann — played by Leonard Scheicher — refutes this theory of superiority, developing his own ""race theory."" He gives a lecture on the fact that all humans are descended from one and the same ""race,"" namely Homo Sapiens. He proves his thesis with the knowledge he gained by talking to and examining the Herero woman Kezia Kambazembi, who is portrayed by Namibian actress Girley Charlene Jazama.Hoffman becomes aware of her at Berlin's Völkerschau, an ethnic show also known as a ""human zoo,"" where she is forced to serve as an exhibit for paying visitors. She serves as his scientific research object, and the young researcher initially seems like someone who will fight against the established race theory..Stealing the skulls of the victims""For this provocative thesis, he doesn't get the lectureship he wants at Friedrich Wilhelm University,"" explains director Lars Kraume. ""Then, years later, when the Herero uprising breaks out in German South West Africa, he gets a second chance.""As part of an ethnological expedition, he travels through the German colony, accompanied by the Imperial Army, collecting artifacts and skulls from the dead of the conflict for the Ethnological Museum in Berlin. He then evolves into an anti-hero as the plot progresses.""The film shows the moral degeneration of this young ethnologist,"" Kraume elaborates. ""He's really only driven by his own success. That's his real motive, and in the process he becomes part of this destructive machinery of the colonizers in Africa."" With tomb looting and the theft of artifacts, ""he makes himself a conformist of the imperial system. All the while, he remains in search of the Herero woman, Kezia, who so fascinated him back in Berlin, and finds her even in the climax of the plot.""Even though his film sheds light on a dark piece of Germany's colonial past, it is still very relevant today, says the director.After all, there are still ""scientists and technicians from large German industrial corporations in Africa who exploit and convince themselves that they are bringing work into the country. In truth, however, they are simply practicing a kind of modern slavery,"" Kraume said. ""The self-legitimization of this amoral scientist is something we see all the time today. That's why I took this character. It just wasn't meant to be a white-savior figure. He's a destroyer.""Alexander Hoffmann's story is fiction, but the events he observes in the film are based on historical facts.In the film, the protagonist repeatedly comes into contact with real locations in history, including the 1896 imperial ethnic show, Lothar von Trotha's extermination order, the expulsion of the Ovaherero into the desert, a concentration camp on Shark Island and missionaries collaborating with the Germans.""The major stages of this odyssey are based on facts. And to get to these places that are vouched for and researched, of course I needed a biography that was fictional. You can't find a biography that traces this exact path. That's why Hoffmann is a fictional character. He is, so to speak, an observer of these real events,"" Kraume explains.The desecration graves and theft of artifacts in the name of science were also commonplace at the time, Kraume says, referring, for example, to the then-director's assistant at the Ethnological Museum in Berlin, Felix von Luschan, who ""was a great skull collector and had a private skull collection of over 10,000 pieces,"" many of which are still in the possession of the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation today.Some critics have taken swipes at Kraume, saying he should have told the film from multiple perspectives, and also included the views of the Ovaherero and Nama. In their view, the film comes across as a post-colonialist reappraisal that only takes up the German view of history, they argue.But Kraume defends himself against this argument by replying that he wanted to prevent a cultural appropriation of the topic. He worked closely with Namibian authorities and artists on the shoot, he says.One costume designer belongs to the Herero tribe, as does the actress of the main character Kezia (who is actually only seen at the beginning and end of the film). But he did not want to presume to tell a heroic story of a Herero leader. As a result, however, the suffering of the Herero in the film recedes into the background and they become mere backdrops for the plotline in a white perpetrator story.Lars Kraume, at any rate, wants his film to come to terms with Germany's colonial past. ""The public must become aware that we were once this great colonial power and also committed terrible crimes,"" says the director, who has already dealt with other controversial topics of German history in films such as ""The State against Fritz Bauer"" (2015) and ""The Silent Classroom"" (2018).The denial of these crimes must stop, says Kraume. The reparation agreement with Namibia must finally be reached; human remains, thousands of which are still in museums, must be restituted; and the discussion about looted art must continue, he adds.He also shows his film in German schools. ""Schoolchildren are insanely open and comment on everything. They are honestly my favorite audience,"" Kraume says. ""I have sons myself who are teenagers. Of course, I don't want them to travel to Africa to look at the elephants, as many people do, without knowing what our real connection is to countries like Namibia.""""Der vermessene Mensch"" is out in cinemas in Germany, Austria and Switzerland.This article was originally written in German and adapted by John Silk.",2023/03/27,,

He is set to be confirmed as first minister on Tuesday.Yousaf, who was considered the ""continuity Sturgeon"" candidate and is the current health minister, beat Finance Minister Kate Forbes and SNP lawmaker Ash Regan.""Just as I will lead the SNP in the interests of all party members, not just those who voted for me, so I will lead Scotland in the interests of all our citizens whatever your political allegiance,"" he said in an acceptance speech at Edinburgh's Murrayfield rugby stadium.The new SNP leader, who is a practicing Muslim, also mentioned his late grandparents who were born in Punjab and moved to Glasgow 60 years ago.""They couldn't have imagined, in their wildest dreams, that two generations later their grandson would one day be Scotland's first minister,"" he said. ""We should all take pride in the fact that today we have sent a clear message: That your color of skin, your faith, is not a barrier to leading the country we all call home.""Yousaf also said his ""starting principle"" is to challenge the decision by Westminster to veto Scotland's Gender Recognition Bill. He was the only leadership candidate who supported the legislation.Sturgeon stood down after failing secure a second independence referendum for Scotland and in the wake of the transgender rights law that brought the devolved government in Edinburgh into conflict with the UK government in London.The party holds 64 of the 129 seats in the Scottish parliament as well as 45 seats in the UK Parliament. But the leadership campaign has tanked the party's popularity in the polls, sparking hope among the Conservative and Labour parties that they could pick up some seats in the next UK-wide election, due by the end of 2024.The SNP has built its support on pushing for independence from the UK. It secured a referendum on the question in 2014 which it lost with only 44% of the votes in favor.But the nationalists pinned their hopes on a second referendum following Brexit due to the fact that support for the EU is higher in Scotland than in England.""The people of Scotland need independence now, more than ever before, and we will be the generation that delivers independence,"" Yousaf said in his victory speech.ab/jcg (AP, dpa)",2023/03/27,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848433,India: What's next for opposition leader Rahul Gandhi?,"Rahul Gandhi, a former head of the Indian National Congress, was quickly ousted from the country's parliament after a court convicted him of defamation last week.The conviction was related to a speech Gandhi made in 2019, where he mocked the surname of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, referring to thieves as having the surname Modi.His removal from Parliament came as a body blow to his party ahead of the general election set for next year.The 52-year-old opposition leader faced the defamation case over remarks he made at a rally in southern Karnataka state ahead of the 2019 parliamentary election. Gandhi targeted Modi for alleged corruption and took a swipe at his last name, which he shares with fugitive billionaire businessmen Nirav Modi and Lalit Modi.""Why do all thieves share the Modi surname?"" Gandhi asked in the speech.Many political leaders were surprised by the haste with which authorities moved to disqualify Gandhi, despite the court giving him 30 days to appeal the verdict.""Judgment on 23 March, disqualification on 24 March. The speed with which the system moved is astonishing,"" said senior Congress leader Palaniappan Chidambaram.""In PM Modi's new India, opposition leaders have become the prime targets of the BJP. Today, we have witnessed a new low for our constitutional democracy,"" said Mamata Banerjee, West Bengal chief minister, following the expulsion.Congress MP Shashi Tharoor also sees it as a bad sign.""This is politics with the gloves off and it bodes ill for our democracy,"" he said.Meanwhile, Gandhi was lambasted by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over the statements made during his recent speaking tour in the UK, where he bemoaned the crumbling structures of Indian democracy. The BJP insisted that Gandhi should apologize for his remarks on ""foreign soil.""Gandhi refused to apologize. He has also attacked the government over Modi's alleged ties to business tycoon Gautam Adani, who in January was accused by an American research and investment firm of committing fraud and stock-price manipulation.The Congress party is now launching a nationwide campaign to coordinate with like-minded opposition parties against the government. Protests, street-corner meetings between party representatives and the public, and marches are being held in different parts of the country.Several political parties, including the Trinamool Congress, Aam Aadmi Party, Bharat Rashtra Samithi, Samajwadi Party and others have already extended strong support for the embattled leader.While Narendra Modi is still considered India's most popular politician, Gandhi boasts impressive political ties — he is the great-grandson of India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, the grandson of the nation's first female Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, and son of another former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.""This family has raised the voice of the people of India and fought for truth for generations,"" said Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi, Rahul's sister, while hitting out at Narendra Modi in a public rally. ""The blood that runs in our veins has one unique feature. We have never bowed down before a coward, power-hungry dictator like you and will never bow down. Do what you want.""Gandhi's removal also comes at a time after 14 political parties filed a petition in the Supreme Court alleging that Modi's government was engaged in politically motivated financial-crime investigations of opposition leaders.""This opportunity could serve to energize the Congress party rank-and-file and perhaps, provide unity of purpose among opposition parties. But it will have to calibrate its moves well to take on a formidable BJP,"" political commentator Rasheed Kidwai told DW.As author of several books on Gandhi's Congress party, including ""Sonia, a biography"" which focuses on Rahul's mother and former party leader Sonia Gandhi, Kidwai pointed out that a politically-driven civil stir could be very useful for government opponents.""Rahul Gandhi is said to have interacted with over 150 civil society organizations while crisscrossing the country. Now, it is time to integrate them into a political campaign. Extraordinary situations call for drastic actions,"" added Kidwai.The court has also sentenced Gandhi to two years in prison over his remarks. Under Indian law, the sentence bars him from contesting elections for eight years or until a higher court stays or overturns his conviction and sentence. This would likely keep the politician from running in national elections scheduled in 2024.But Gandhi's legal team hopes to nullify the ban by either overturning the decision or reducing his sentence to under two years.""We are confident that we will get a stay of conviction. A stay of conviction will remove the very basis of this disqualification. It takes time to draft and to file. They are taking advantage of that time… hot-footing it by these disqualification notices… but we have full faith in the law,"" said Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi, also a senior lawyer.The BJP, for its part, denied that the process against Gandhi was politically motivated. It pointed out that he was convicted by a court in Surat after the due legal process and his disqualification as an MP was an automatic legal consequence.""What is the purpose of your satyagraha (passive resistance)? You don't have faith in the law,"" BJP president J.P. Nadda said, addressing Gandhi. ""You hurl caste abuse. The court says to tender an apology but you have an ego, you don't (apologize). Your membership (of Parliament) is gone but your ego remains.""Edited by: Darko Janjevic",2023/03/27,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848435,Sabres' Russian player won't take part in Pride night warmup,"BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) — Ilya Lyubushkin cited an anti-gay Kremlin law and fears of retribution at home in Russia for electing not to participate in the Buffalo Sabres’ pregame warmup on the team’s Pride night, when players wore jerseys with the team's rainbow-colored logo on the front in support of the LGBTQ+ community.The team announced Lyubushkin’s decision Monday before Buffalo's game against Montreal. Lyubushkin is from Moscow, where he has family and visits regularly in the offseason.The 28-year-old defenseman was Buffalo's only healthy player not to take part in the warmups, before participating in the game. The remaining players took the ice wearing dark blue jerseys with the Sabres logo on the front encircled by a rainbow-colored outline, the same design as the team used for its social media avatar throughout the day.A handful of players had their sticks wrapped in Pride tape, and the Sabres warmed up with commemorative pucks, featuring the date and both teams' logos in rainbow colors. As in the Sabres' past two Pride Nights, the Buffalo Gay Men's Chorus sang the American and Canadian national anthems.“We continue to advocate for under-represented groups in hockey and hope that our Pride Night, like many across the league, sparks meaningful conversation and encourages support for the LGBTQIA+ community,” the team said in a statement.“Our team feels strongly that one way to garner support is through wearing Pride jerseys and using Pride tape in warmups,” the team said. Without mentioning Lyubushkin specifically, the Sabres added: “We are are aware of general threats to certain players, and understand their decision to forego risk.”Sabres captain Kyle Okposo, whose father is from Nigeria and faced discrimination for being Black upon immigrating to Minnesota, defended his teammate while citing the importance of celebrating a Pride night.“We support Boosh (Lyubushkin) in this room, and we want to make sure that he’s comfortable and we respect his decisions,” Okposo said.“I have empathy for my teammate, for Boosh in the situation he’s in, but think about it: If there’s a closeted gay member of a team, and you have to have empathy for that person, too, in that situation,” he said. “We have to realize that and that’s part of being accepting, and that’s why we want to be accepting.”Okposo also reiterated what he told The Associated Press last week when he said he’s sensitive to Russian players’ concerns because “we’re frankly not capable of understanding, because we haven’t been there.”It has not just been Russian players opting out of warmups that have put Pride nights around the NHL in the spotlight in recent months.Ivan Provorov of the Philadelphia Flyers, James Reimer of the San Jose Sharks and Eric and Marc Staal of the Florida Panthers all refused to take part in warmups with Pride-themed jerseys, citing religious beliefs, while the New York Rangers, Minnesota Wild and Chicago Blackhawks opted not to have players wear them at all. Reimer and the Staal brothers are Canadian.The Blackhawks, like Lyubushkin, cited a law passed last year in Russia that expanded the restrictions on supporting LGBTQ+ rights in the country as their reasoning.The Florida Panthers — whose star goaltender, Sergei Bobrovsky, is Russian — went forward with plans to wear Pride-themed jerseys on Thursday night before their home game against Toronto. Bobrovsky took part.The Sabres' Pride Night Jerseys and sticks were scheduled to be auctioned off on the team's website, with proceeds going to local Pride organizations.Sabres coach Don Granato said he left the discussion and decision to his players on how to handle Pride night.“It was nice for our group to really take an event like this and have a lot of meaningful conversations, even leading up to it based on what’s going around the world — around the U.S. and around the world — and actually have talks (about) more than hockey,” Granato said. “I think the authenticity of our group has been really a silver-lining positive of the event that we’re excited to have tonight.”Okposo said what he found important was that Sabres players were engaging in discussions on a sensitive topic.“I think that is something that as a society as a whole, we’re still grappling with, and as a hockey community, we’re still grappling with as well,” Okposo said. “But we’re getting better. And we are going to continue to have these conversations and continue to get better. But it’s extremely important to have this night tonight.”___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/28,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848447,"Nashville shooter who killed 6 drew maps, surveilled school","NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — A former student shot through the doors of a Christian elementary school Monday and killed three children and three adults after elaborately planning the massacre by drawing out a detailed map and conducting surveillance of the building, police said.The massacre at The Covenant School in Nashville was the latest in a series of mass shootings in a country that has grown increasingly unnerved by bloodshed in schools.The victims included three 9-year-old children, the school’s top administrator, a substitute teacher and a custodian. Amid the chaos a familiar ritual played out: Panicked parents rushed to the school to see if their children were safe and tearfully hugged their kids, and a stunned community planned vigils for the victims.“I was literally moved to tears to see this and the kids as they were being ushered out of the building,” Metropolitan Nashville Police Chief John Drake said during one of several news conferences.Police gave unclear information on the gender of the shooter, who police say was fatally shot by two responding officers at the school. For hours, police identified the shooter as a 28-year-old woman and eventually identified the person as Audrey Hale. Then at a late afternoon press conference, the police chief said that Hale was transgender. After the news conference, police spokesperson Don Aaron declined to elaborate on how Hale currently identified.Drake did not give a specific motive when asked by reporters but gave chilling examples of the shooter’s prior planning for the targeted attack.“We have a manifesto, we have some writings that we’re going over that pertain to this date, the actual incident,” he said. “We have a map drawn out of how this was all going to take place.”He said in an interview with NBC News that investigators believe Hale had “some resentment for having to go to that school.”The shooter gained entry by firing into glass doors on the building, shattering them, police later said in a tweet.The shooter was armed with two “assault-style” weapons as well as a handgun, authorities said. At least two of them were believed to have been obtained legally in the Nashville area, according to the chief.Police said a search of the shooter's home turned up a a sawed-off shotgun, a second shotgun and other unspecified evidence.The victims were identified as Evelyn Dieckhaus, Hallie Scruggs, and William Kinney, all 9 years old, and adults Cynthia Peak, 61; Katherine Koonce, 60; and Mike Hill, 61.The website of The Covenant School, a Presbyterian school founded in 2001, lists a Katherine Koonce as the head of the school. Her LinkedIn profile says she has led the school since July 2016. Peak was a substitute teacher and Hill was a custodian, according to investigators.Students held hands as they walked to school buses, which drove them to a nearby church to be reunited with their parents.Rachel Dibble, who was at the church as families found their children, described the scene as everyone being in “complete shock.”“People were involuntarily trembling,” said Dibble, whose children attend a different private school in Nashville. “The children … started their morning in their cute little uniforms, they probably had some Froot Loops and now their whole lives changed today.”Communities around the U.S. has suffered through one mass killing after another in recent years, with school shootings taking an especially painful toll.Recent tragedies nationwide include the massacre at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, last year; a first grader who shot his teacher in Virginia; and a shooting last week in Denver that wounded two administrators.President Joe Biden, speaking at the White House on Monday, called the shooting a “family’s worst nightmare” and implored Congress again to pass a ban on certain semi-automatic weapons.“It’s ripping at the soul of this nation, ripping at the very soul of this nation,” Biden said.Biden later ordered the U.S. flag to be flown at half-staff on all federal buildings through March 31. He also spoke to Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee and Nashville Mayor John Cooper about the shooting, officials said.Founded as a ministry of Covenant Presbyterian Church — which is affiliated with the conservative evangelical Presbyterian Church in America — The Covenant School is located in the affluent Green Hills neighborhood just south of downtown Nashville that is home to the famed Bluebird Café – a spot typically beloved by musicians and songwriters.The school has about 200 students from preschool through sixth grade, as well as roughly 50 staff members.“Our community is heartbroken,” a statement from the school said. “We are grieving tremendous loss and are in shock coming out of the terror that shattered our school and church. We are focused on loving our students, our families, our faculty and staff and beginning the process of healing.”Before Monday’s violence in Nashville, there had been seven mass killings at K-12 schools since 2006 in which four or more people were killed within a 24-hour period, according to a database maintained by The Associated Press and USA Today in partnership with Northeastern University. In all of them, the shooters were males.The database does not include school shootings in which fewer than four people were killed, which have become far more common in recent years. Just last week alone, for example, school shootings happened in Denver and the Dallas-area within two days of each other.Monday's tragedy unfolded over roughly 14 minutes. Police received the initial call about an active shooter at 10:13 a.m.Officers began clearing the first story of the school when they heard gunshots coming from the second level, Aaron said during a news briefing. Police later said in a tweet that the shooter fired at arriving officers from a second-story window and had come armed with significant ammunition.Two officers from a five-member team opened fire in response, fatally shooting the suspect at 10:27 a.m., Aaron said. One officer had a hand wound from cut glass.Late Monday night, police released approximately two minutes of edited surveillance video showing the shooter’s car driving up to the school from multiple angles, including one in which children can be seen playing on swings in the background. Next an interior view shows glass doors to the school being shot out and the shooter ducking through one of the shattered doors.More footage from inside shows the shooter walking through a school corridor holding a gun with a long barrel and walking into a room labeled “church office,” then coming back out. In the final part of the footage, the shooter can be seen walking down another long corridor with the gun drawn. The shooter is not seen interacting with anyone else on the video, which has no sound.Aaron said there were no police officers present or assigned to the school at the time of the shooting because it is a church-run school.Jozen Reodica heard the police sirens and fire trucks blaring from outside her office building nearby. As her building was placed under lockdown, she took out her phone and recorded the chaos.“I thought I would just see this on TV,” she said. “And right now, it’s real.”Nashville has seen its share of mass violence in recent years, including a Christmas Day 2020 attack where a recreational vehicle was intentionally detonated in the heart of Music City’s historic downtown, killing the bomber, injuring three others and forcing more than 60 businesses to close.A reeling city mourned during multiple vigils Monday evening. At Belmont United Methodist Church, teary sniffling filled the background as vigil attendees sang, knelt in prayer and lit candles. They lamented the national cycle of violent and deadly shootings, at one point reciting together, “we confess we have not done enough to protect” the children injured or killed in shootings.“We need to step back. We need to breathe. We need to grieve,” said Paul Purdue, the church’s senior pastor. “We need to remember. We need to make space for others who are grieving. We need to hear the cries of our neighbors.”___Contributing to this report were Associated Press writers Kristin Hall in Nashville; Denise Lavoie in Richmond, Virginia; John Raby in Charleston, West Virginia; Stefanie Dazio in Los Angeles; Beatrice Dupuy and Larry Fenn in New York; and Lisa Baumann in Bellingham, Washington; as well as AP researchers Randy Herschaft and Rhonda Shafner in New York.",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848448,Review: Vietnam vets try to help nation they once attacked,"“The Long Reckoning: A Story of War, Peace and Redemption in Vietnam,” by George Black (Knopf)In the U.S., we’ve mostly moved on from our military engagements in Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan. It’s the American way — not dwelling on our mistakes or engaging in a national discussion about what went wrong.And atonement? We don’t do that.But two American Vietnam vets thought differently and became our national conscience, our moral center and our agents of redemption in dealing with the fearsome toll that herbicide spraying and unexploded bombs inflicted on tens of thousands of Vietnamese.Manus Campbell, a Marine from New Jersey, and Chuck Searcy, an Army intelligence analyst from Georgia, have spent the past few decades in Vietnam leading efforts to heal the hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese still suffering from war wounds or diseases linked to herbicide exposure.Thanks to Campbell, Searcy and a small group of scientists and others, the U.S. and others are providing the resources to help find unexploded bombs and treat Vietnamese struggling with diseases likely linked to herbicide exposure.George Black’s reporting for “The Long Reckoning” is deep and wide — he made nine trips to Vietnam and the result is a meticulously reported, extraordinary account of efforts, mostly Searcy’s and Campbell’s, to bring medical care in an area most severely affected by herbicides the U.S. military used in Vietnam in an effort to expose the maze of roads and trails the North Vietnamese used to move weapons and supplies to the south.Goodreads counts 323 books written on the Vietnam War. In these books, the stages and characters are different, but the end remains mostly the same. America clung to the belief that its overwhelming military power could bend a people to its will.It could not and in the silence when the shooting and bombing finally ended, Vietnamese confronted a nation in ruins. Millions had been killed or wounded, cities and towns were wrecked and hundreds of square miles had been defoliated by herbicide spray that polluted water supplies and likely caused severe and lingering health problems.This book, however, offers an inspiring epilog to the Vietnam tragedy.“I thought we had a moral obligation to help,” said Searcy. “I wanted to participate in the rebuilding.”So did Campbell; both men have spent most of the past few decades in Vietnam, focusing on getting assistance for the millions of Vietnamese still suffering from the war’s chemical and explosive legacy.Searcy says he has been overwhelmed by the graciousness of the Vietnamese, and particularly former combatants, which has given him a revelation on America today. “If the veterans can come together and make peace, why can’t we all?”",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848449,Georgia judge orders prosecutors to reply to Trump challenge,"ATLANTA (AP) — A Georgia judge on Monday ordered the Fulton County district attorney’s office to respond to a motion by former President Donald Trump to throw out a report by a special grand jury that investigated attempts to interfere in the state’s 2020 presidential election.The motion by Trump’s legal team also seeks to toss out all testimony from the inquiry and to bar Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis from continuing to investigate or prosecute Trump.Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney ordered Willis to respond by May 1 and to let him know whether an in-person hearing is needed to resolve any issues. A spokesperson for Willis said her office would reply through its court filings.The filing is an effort by Trump to escape one of the multiple legal challenges he faces, including a state inquiry in New York into hush money payments to women who alleged sexual encounters with the former president as well as a pair of U.S. Justice Department criminal investigations. One examines his efforts to overturn his loss in the 2020 election. The other examines Trump’s possession of hundreds of classified documents at his Florida estate.Willis began her investigation shortly after the release of a recording of a January 2021 phone call between Trump and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. In that conversation, the then-president suggested that Raffensperger, a fellow Republican, could “find” the exact number of votes needed to overturn Trump’s narrow election loss in the state to Democrat Joe Biden.The special grand jury heard from about 75 witnesses and considered other evidence before issuing a report that includes recommendations for Willis on criminal charges. McBurney released the report’s introduction and conclusion, as well as a section in which the grand jurors expressed concerns that some witnesses may have lied under oath, but the rest of the report has remained under wraps so far.Willis said in a January hearing that decisions on indictments were “imminent.”The challenge by Trump's legal team, filed last Monday, also contended that McBurney misinterpreted Georgia law and erred by not disqualifying Willis from the entire probe when he ruled in July that Willis could not pursue charges against Burt Jones, now Georgia's lieutenant governor.Trump's lawyers asked for another judge besides McBurney to hear the challenge. He did not acknowledge that push in Monday's brief order.The lawyers also faulted Willis for granting repeated news interviews, citing a list of 39 media appearances and saying her comments cast ”a shadow of bias over her office and the entire investigation.""Trump's lawyers similarly argued that interviews that the foreperson and other grand jurors have given should disqualify the case.",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848450,"Landslide in Ecuador kills at least 7, with dozens missing","ALAUSI, Ecuador (AP) — A huge landslide swept over an Andean community in central Ecuador, burying dozens of homes, killing at least seven people and sending rescuers on a frantic search for survivors, authorities said Monday.Earlier in the day, officials had reported 16 deaths, but President Guillermo Lasso put the confirmed toll at seven as he arrived Monday night at the scene of the disaster in Alausí, about 137 miles south of the capital, Quito. Officials also raised the number of people reported missing to 62.Lasso lamented the tragedy and promised people in the town that “we will continue working"" on the search effort.Ecuador’s Risk Management Secretariat said more than 30 people were rescued after the mountainside collapsed around 10 p.m. Sunday. It said 23 people were injured.“My mother is buried"" under the mud, said Luis Ángel González, 58, who also lost other family members Sunday. ""I am so sad, devastated. There is nothing here, no houses, no anything. We are homeless (and) without family.”The risk management agency estimated 500 people and 163 homes were affected by the disaster, which also destroyed a portion of the Pan-American Highway.The governor of Chimborazo, Ivan Vinueza, told The Associated Press that some of the injured were taken to area hospitals. He said officials had urged people to evacuate the area after landslides and cracks began to develop about two months ago. Some followed the advice, and by Saturday, as tremors intensified, others fled.Area residents told local media they heard tremors on the mountain before the landslide, which was estimated to be about 150 meters (490 feet) wide and nearly a half mile (700 meters) long. It swept away trees, homes and other buildings. More than fifty houses were buried under tons of mud of debris.The emergency response agency said 60% of potable water service in the area was affected by the landslide. The communication’s office of the presidential office said some schools would be switching to online classes.Firefighters from a half dozen cities were dispatched to the area to help. Rescuers focused on the flanks of the landslide where they found traces and debris of houses.Rescuer and paramedic Alberto Escobar said it was unlikely more survivors would be found because of the time that had elapsed.He said the search would continue as long as it did not rain.Video from cameras connected to the country’s emergency service network showed people fleeing their homes with help from neighbors. It also showed people transporting appliances and other belongings in vehicles.Survivors, many housed in temporary shelters, cried over their misfortune.Among them was the Zuña family, who were staying at the Iglesia Matriz de Alausí, where rooms for catechism or parish meetings were adapted with bunk beds days ago after authorities declared an emergency in the area due to the risk of landslides.Sonia Guadalupe Zuña said her mother was reluctant to leave what they had built over the years.“We went to the shelter, but my mother didn’t want to,” Zuña said. “Later, my daughter went to convince her. When they walked along the rails, everything collapsed. They arrived covered in dirt and crying.”Save for the clothes they had on, Zuña's family lost everything.“I don’t know where, but we’re all leaving,"" she said crying. ""My parents taught us that by working hard, you get material things, but being together is priceless.”___Associated Press writers Gonzalo Solano in Quito and Regina Garcia Cano in Caracas, Venezuela, contributed to this report.",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848451,Jumbled wreckage complicates chocolate factory blast probe,"Investigators looking for the cause of a deadly explosion that leveled part of a Pennsylvania chocolate factory faced an even more difficult task Monday as they combed through wreckage that was extensively picked apart and moved around during the intensive weekend search for victims and survivors.Seven people were killed and several others wounded in the powerful blast at the R.M Palmer Co. plant in West Reading, Pennsylvania, about 60 miles (96 kilometers) northwest of Philadelphia. One survivor was pulled from the rubble hours after the explosion rattled windows and shook houses.With the recovery effort now over, attention turned to identifying the cause — a task complicated by the jumbled wreckage.“The No. 1 goal of this, once the fire was out, gas stopped, is to look for the victims,” Pennsylvania State Police Master Trooper David Beohm said at a news conference Monday afternoon. “So with that, when they picked the building apart with the excavator, yes, it makes it really hard then to try to figure out things. ... It makes it really difficult to try to come up with a cause.”Authorities declined to address reports that plant workers had detected an odor of gas before the explosion. The gas utility UGI said it had received no reports of a gas leak at the family-owned candy company.“Everything’s on the table at this point because we’re still not done with the investigation. To say it’s one way or another, I would not say that at this point,"" Beohm said. Two state police fire marshals are working to determine the cause and origin of the blast, he said.The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which regulates workplace safety, was also at the site.Natural gas wasn't the only possible cause.Chocolate companies and other food manufacturers must take steps to mitigate the risk of fire and explosion from flammable dust produced by ingredients like cocoa powder and corn starch, said Holly Burgess, technical lead for industrial and chemical safety at the National Fire Protection Association, a nonprofit group that produces hundreds of codes and standards.Burgess said smaller particles that stay aloft pose a greater danger than bigger particles that quickly fall to the floor. Food manufacturers are supposed to determine the combustibility of the dust, perform a hazard analysis and then take steps to manage it.“Each batch is different, so the chocolate material in cocoa that I’m getting from one place might have a bigger particle size or a smaller particle size. So that’s where they usually need to do their own testing,” said Burgess, speaking generally and not about the situation at Palmer.Commercial ovens and furnaces, and commercial refrigerant using ammonia, are other primary explosive hazards at food plants, she said.Records from OSHA, the federal workplace safety agency, show only one violation at the West Reading plant over the past five years. In 2018, an employee lost the tip of a finger during the cleaning of a pneumatically pressurized ball valve. The company agreed to pay a $13,000 fine.In January, records show, OSHA levied a penalty of more than $12,000 after an inspection at R.M. Palmer’s plant in nearby Wyomissing. Details of that case were not immediately available.R.M. Palmer said in a weekend statement that everyone at the company was devastated, and it was reaching out to employees and their families through first responders and disaster recovery organizations because its communication systems were down. “The tragic events that occurred on Friday have had a profound impact on all of us at R.M. Palmer, and we appreciate the outpouring of support as all of us continue to deal with the loss of our friends and coworkers,” the company said on Facebook Sunday.The company has not commented further. It did not respond to questions from The Associated Press on Monday.The Berks County coroner’s office identified two of the victims as 49-year-old Amy Sandoe of Ephrata and 60-year-old Domingo Cruz of Reading and said “additional forensic medical examinations” would be needed to positively identify the other five victims. Autopsies were expected to be completed by the end of week, officials said.Rescue crews had been using heat-imaging equipment and dogs to search for possible survivors after the blast destroyed one building and damaged a neighboring building. Crews were using heavy equipment to methodically and carefully pull debris from the site, according to police Chief Wayne Holben.Three buildings around the site were condemned as a precaution until further examination by structural engineers to ensure their safety.Officials said they had no update on the condition of a woman pulled alive from the rubble early Saturday. Mayor Samantha Kaag has said she had apparently been on the second floor and was found in a “hopeful circumstance,” calling out to rescuers despite her injuries after a dog found her.Reading Hospital said it received 10 patients and transferred two to other facilities, while two others were admitted in good and fair condition, respectively, and the others had been discharged. Dr. Charles Barbera, the hospital's president and CEO, said one of the admitted patients was discharged Monday.UGI spokesperson Joe Swope said the utility detected leaks at a few street-level locations some distance from the plant after the gas was turned back on, and completed repairs. “The company believes these are unrelated to the explosion at Palmer,” he said.",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848452,Taron Egerton slots Tetris story into place in new biopic,"The origin story of the iconic computer game “Tetris” is more thrilling than you may think.It involves border crossing, authority dodging, underhand deals, putting your house on the line and — finally — trying to secure the rights for the game from behind the Iron Curtain. And now it's a film, releasing March 31, on Apple TV+.After playing an early version of Tetris, game designer Henk Rogers (played by Taron Egerton) travels to the Soviet Union in 1988 to meet Tetris designer Alexey Pajitnov (played by Nikita Efremov), hoping to secure worldwide distribution rights to the game. Rogers was driven by his love of Tetris and his eagerness for the world to experience it, but the transaction was not smooth.Egerton says he doesn’t have the tenacity of Rogers, who potentially put his life on the line for the sake of the game.“I have a more developed sense of my own frailty and vulnerability than he does, I think, whereas he’s got this kind of single-minded lack of, sense of self-preservation,” he said in a recent interview.He added: “I really like his sort of single-minded, determined devil-may-care thing. It makes him an appealing hero, you know, his kind of cowboyishness. But yeah, I probably wouldn’t have done anything like what he did to get the rights to Tetris.”The movie is directed by Jon S. Baird, who switched projects from action sequel “Kingsman 3"" because of the pandemic, bringing his leading man — Egerton — and producer Matthew Vaughn along for the ride.“We were looking for something to do and the ‘Tetris’ script landed and we thought, ‘Right, that’s great let’s just move everything on to that.’ And that’s really what happened,” he said.While the pandemic stopped Pajitnov and Rogers from being involved in the actual shoot, the duo was involved heavily in the scriptwriting and in detailing the imagery of Soviet Russia, much of which was recreated in Aberdeen and Glasgow, Scotland.Baird said he was apprehensive about showing Pajitnov and Rogers the finished movie but was overjoyed at their response.“I got a text from Maya, who’s Henk’s daughter, who’s obviously personified in the film, too and she was like, ‘They all love it. They all absolutely love the movie.’”Egerton, known to many for portraying Elton John in “Rocketman,” says he finds playing a real-life person “odd.” However, he believes that the men he has brought to the screen have all enjoyed his portrayals, smiling that “it hasn’t blown up in my face yet!”",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848453,US to adopt new restrictions on using commercial spyware,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. government will restrict its use of commercial spyware tools that have been used to surveil human rights activists, journalists and dissidents around the world, under an executive order issued Monday by President Joe Biden.The order responds to growing U.S. and global concerns about programs that can capture text messages and other cellphone data. Some programs — so-called “zero-click” exploits — can infect a phone without the user clicking on a malicious link.Governments around the world — including the U.S. — are known to collect large amounts of data for intelligence and law enforcement purposes, including communications from their own citizens. The proliferation of commercial spyware has made powerful tools newly available to smaller countries, but also created what researchers and human-rights activists warn are opportunities for abuse and repression.The White House released the executive order in advance of its second summit for democracy this week. The order “demonstrates the United States' leadership in, and commitment to, advancing technology for democracy, including by countering the misuse of commercial spyware and other surveillance technology,” the White House said in a statement.Biden’s order, billed as a prohibition on using commercial spyware “that poses risks to national security,” allows for some exceptions.The order will require the head of any U.S. agency using commercial programs to certify that the program doesn’t pose a significant counterintelligence or other security risk, a senior administration official said.Among the factors that will be used to determine the level of security risk is if a foreign actor has used the program to monitor U.S. citizens without legal authorization or surveil human rights activists and other dissidents.“It is intended to be a high bar but also includes remedial steps that can be taken ... in which a company may argue that their tool has not been misused,” said the official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity under White House ground rules.The White House will not publish a list of banned programs as part of the executive order, the official said.John Scott-Railton, a researcher at the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab who has long studied spyware, credited the Biden administration for trying to set new global standards for the industry.“Most spyware companies see selling to the U.S. as their eventual exit path,"" Scott-Railton said. “The issue is the U.S. until now hasn't really wielded its purchasing power to push the industry to do better.”Congress last year required U.S. intelligence agencies to investigate foreign use of spyware and gave the Office of the Director of National Intelligence the power to ban any agency from using commercial programs.Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said in a committee hearing last year that commercial spyware posed a “very serious threat to our democracy and to democracies around the world.” He said Monday the new order should be followed by other democracies taking steps against spyware.“It's a very powerful statement and a good tool, but alone it won't do the trick,"" he said.Perhaps the best known example of spyware, the Pegasus software from Israel's NSO Group, was used to target more than 1,000 people across 50 countries, according to security researchers and a July 2021 global media investigation, citing a list of more than 50,000 cellphone numbers. The U.S. has already placed export limits on NSO Group, restricting the company's access to U.S. components and technology.Officials would not say if U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies currently use any commercial spyware. The FBI last year confirmed it had purchased NSO Group’s Pegasus tool “for product testing and evaluation only,” and not for operational purposes or to support any investigation.White House officials said Monday they believe 50 devices used by U.S. government employees, across 10 countries, had been compromised or targeted by commercial spyware.Despite NSO's assertions that the program is supposed to be used to counter terrorism and crime, researchers found the numbers of more than 180 journalists, 600 politicians and government officials, and 85 human rights activists.Pegasus use was most commonly linked to Mexico and countries in the Middle East. Amnesty International has alleged Pegasus was installed on the phone of Jamal Khashoggi's fiancée just four days before the journalist was killed in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018. NSO has denied the allegation that its software was used in connection with Khashoggi's murder.The family of Paul Rusesabagina, credited with saving more than 1,200 lives during the Rwandan genocide, a story depicted in the movie “Hotel Rwanda,” has also alleged it was targeted by spyware. Rusesabagina was lured back to Rwanda under false pretenses and jailed on terrorism charges before his release last week. Rwanda has denied using commercial spyware.",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848454,Twitter celebs balk at paying Elon Musk for blue check mark,"William Shatner, Monica Lewinsky and other prolific Twitter commentators — some household names, others little-known journalists — could soon be losing the blue check marks that helped verify their identity on the social media platform.They could get the marks back by paying up to $11 a month. But some longtime users, including 92-year-old Star Trek legend Shatner, have balked at buying the premium service championed by Twitter's billionaire owner and chief executive Elon Musk.After months of delay, Musk is gleefully promising that Friday is the deadline for celebrities, journalists and others who'd been verified for free to pony up or lose their legacy status.""It will be glorious,"" he tweeted Monday, in response to a Twitter user who noted that Friday is also April Fools Day.After buying Twitter for $44 billion in October, Musk has been trying to boost the struggling platform's revenue by pushing more people to pay for a premium subscription. But his move also reflects his assertion that the blue verification marks have become an undeserved or ""corrupt"" status symbol for elite personalities.Along with verifying celebrities, one of Twitter's main reasons to mark profiles with a free blue check mark starting about 14 years ago was to verify politicians, activists and people who suddenly find themselves in the news, as well as little-known journalists at small publications around the globe, as an extra tool to curb misinformation coming from accounts that are impersonating people.Lewinsky tweeted a screenshot Sunday of all the people impersonating her, including at least one who appears to have paid for a blue check mark. She asked, “what universe is this fair to people who can suffer consequences for being impersonated? a lie travels half way around the world before truth even gets out the door.”Shatner, known for his irreverent humor, also tagged Musk with a complaint about the promised changes.“I’ve been here for 15 years giving my (clock emoji) & witty thoughts all for bupkis,” he wrote. “Now you’re telling me that I have to pay for something you gave me for free?”Musk responded that there shouldn't be a different standard for celebrities. “It’s more about treating everyone equally,” Musk tweeted.One of Musk's first product moves after taking over Twitter was to launch a service granting blue checks to anyone willing to pay $8 a month. But it was quickly inundated by imposter accounts, including those impersonating Nintendo, pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly and Musk’s businesses Tesla and SpaceX, so Twitter had to temporarily suspend the service days after its launch.The relaunched service costs $8 a month for web users and $11 a month for iPhone and iPad users. Subscribers are supposed to see fewer ads, be able to post longer videos and have their tweets featured more prominently.",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848455,Patriots owner Robert Kraft campaigns against antisemitism,"New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft faced the camera during a video call, pointing to a small, sky-blue lapel pin on his blazer.The pin is the symbol of a $25 million “Stand Up to Jewish Hate” campaign launched Monday by the 81-year-old billionaire through his Foundation to Combat Antisemitism, aiming to raise awareness nationwide about soaring incidents of antisemitism online and in person. The campaign will feature emotive ads to be introduced by stars of top television shows such as NBC’s “The Voice,” and the “Kelly Clarkson Show,” and Bravo's “Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen.""“This little blue square represents the Jewish population in the United States – 2.4%,” said Kraft, who was raised in Brookline, Massachusetts, in an observant Orthodox Jewish family. “But we’re the victims of 55% of the hate crimes in this country.”The ads are intended to tug at the heartstrings of non-Jewish Americans, said Matthew Berger, the foundation’s executive director. One of the ads, set to premiere Monday, shows a non-Jewish neighbor painting over a garage door vandalized with the Nazi swastika and the words “No Jews,” concluding with the message: “Hate only wins if you let it.”Another ad focuses on online hate: A Jewish teen is shown crestfallen as he is trolled after posting a video of his bar mitzvah. Soon after, he sees a Harlem choir tag him with their version of his worship song. He sings along with the choir as these words pop up on screen: “Voices of support are louder than words of hate.”Berger said the foundation worked with its creative team to find scenarios “that would be specifically impactful and showcase what antisemitism looks like.” He said the ads will be featured during the NFL draft and the NBA and NHL playoffs, as well as on social media, promoted by prominent influencers.The campaign's launch follows last week's release of a report by the Anti-Defamation League asserting that antisemitic incidents in the U.S. rose 36% in 2022. The report tracked 3,697 incidents of harassment, vandalism and assault aimed at Jewish people and communities last year. It's the third time in five years that the annual total has been the highest ever recorded since the group began collecting data in 1979.The Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, based at California State University, San Bernardino, reported last week that Jews were the most targeted of all U.S. religious groups in 2022 in 21 major cities, accounting for 78% of religious hate crimes.Brian Levin, the center’s director, said he is concerned about brazen, public expressions of antisemitism, and the proliferation of antisemitic tropes and conspiracy theories online. A campaign against antisemitism which solicits the support of non-Jewish people can help create awareness, he said.“It is so important to show that antisemitism is un-American,” Levin said. “If we can show non-Jews as allies, that could be powerful.”In October, Kraft’s foundation aired a 30-second ad during a Patriots-Jets game urging the public to speak out against antisemitism. That ad came after antisemitic comments made by the music mogul formerly known as Kanye West and basketball star Kyrie Irving’s apparent support for an antisemitic film.“The rise of antisemitism, to me, is the real breakdown of what this society stands on,” Kraft said. “In my lifetime, I have never seen the way things are right now with this hatred against Jews.”The mass shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh on Oct. 27, 2018, in which 11 people were killed in the nation’s deadliest antisemitic attack, was a catalytic moment in his life, said Kraft. Two months after the shooting, he attended a Shabbat service at the synagogue, the day before his team was to play the Steelers.Kraft established the foundation a year later, after he received the $1 million Genesis Prize, awarded to Jews who have achieved significant professional success and are committed to Jewish values. The annual award is given by the Genesis Foundation in partnership with the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office and the Jewish Agency for Israel.Over the past decade, Kraft has encountered much turbulence in his personal and professional life.In 2015, he and his team got caught up in the so-called “Deflategate” scandal. The NFL issued a 243-page report after an investigation found that Patriots employees violated the league’s rules covering game balls and that the team’s star quarterback, Tom Brady, was “at least generally aware” of plans to deflate the footballs to his liking. Kraft accepted the team penalty of a $1 million fine and loss of two draft picks.In 2020, Florida prosecutors dropped a misdemeanor charge against Kraft after courts blocked their use of video that allegedly showed him paying for massage parlor sex. He issued a statement saying he “hurt and disappointed” his family, friends, co-workers, fans and others who hold him “to a higher standard.”“I expect to be judged not by my words, but by my actions. And through those actions, I hope to regain your confidence and respect,” Kraft said at the time.In recent months, he has become a powerful voice against antisemitism. Kraft says he treasures the spiritual values he inherited from his parents, especially his father who skipped television and other pastimes to read the Torah.“I was privileged to receive that upbringing,” he said. “It gave me a spiritual core no amount of money can buy.”Kraft hopes the ad campaign will help “educate and empower all Americans to stand up against Jewish hate” and the blue square he wears on his lapel will become “a unifying symbol of solidarity"" in that quest.“I hope this campaign calls out hate against all communities – Black people, the LGBTQ community – just anyone who is experiencing hate,” he said. “My hope is this will become an effort that builds bridges with all Americans.”___Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848456,Lamar Jackson says he has requested trade from Ravens,"Lamar Jackson said Monday he has requested a trade from the Baltimore Ravens, saying the team “has not been interested in meeting my value.""In a series of tweets, the star quarterback said he requested a trade as of March 2. On March 7, the Ravens put the nonexclusive franchise tag on Jackson and said they were still hopeful they could reach a long-term deal with him.“As of March 2nd I requested a trade from the Ravens organization for which the Ravens has not been interested in meeting my value,” Jackson said on Twitter. “Any and everyone that’s has met me or been around me know I love the game of football and my dream is to help a team win the super bowl.”Jackson may not need a trade to join a new team. The nonexclusive franchise tag allows him to negotiate with other clubs. However, it also gives Baltimore a chance to match any agreement he makes. The decision to make the trade request public may be an attempt to deter the Ravens from matching another team's offer — or an attempt to spur more interest among other teams by declaring that he wants out of Baltimore.If Jackson makes a deal with another team and the Ravens don't match, that team would owe Baltimore two first-round draft picks.Ravens coach John Harbaugh spoke extensively about Jackson on Monday at the league's owners meetings in Phoenix.“I haven't seen the tweet. That's an ongoing process,” Harbaugh said. “I'm following it very closely, just like everybody else is here, and looking forward to a resolution. I'm excited, thinking about Lamar all the time, thinking about him as our quarterback. We're building our offense around that idea.”Jackson was the 2019 NFL MVP. His passing and running ability make him one of the game’s biggest stars. At age 25, he already is one of six quarterbacks in NFL history with 10,000 yards passing and 4,000 rushing.Jackson has been hurt at the end of the past two seasons, and the Ravens haven’t reached the AFC championship game with him. If he remains with Baltimore, he’ll have a new coordinator. The Ravens hired Georgia’s Todd Monken for that position after the end of last season.Harbaugh said he anticipates Jackson being Baltimore's quarterback at the start of next season.“You've got to plan for all the contingencies for sure,” Harbaugh said. “But I'm pretty fired up about Lamar Jackson. I mean, Lamar Jackson is a great player. Lamar came back in great shape last year. He's fired up to play. That's the Lamar that I'm looking forward to seeing. Can't wait to get back on the grass and go to work, and I'm confident that's going to happen.”Harbaugh tried to stay upbeat about the prospects of Jackson's return. If Jackson does come back and play this season on Baltimore's $32.4 million franchise tag, it could certainly be an awkward situation, and the coach will have his work cut out for him trying to soothe any hard feelings.“Nothing's changed in terms of the relationships, how we feel about Lamar, how we want to build our team,"" Harbaugh said.Jackson does not have an agent. In a memo sent to teams last week and obtained by The Associated Press, the NFL management council said a person who is not an NFLPA-certified agent may be contacting clubs and attempting to persuade them to negotiate with Jackson. The memo reminded teams that, under the collective bargaining agreement, if a player is representing himself, an offer sheet can only be negotiated with that player.Jackson said on Twitter the person in question never tried to negotiate for him.___AP Pro Football Writer Rob Maaddi contributed to this report.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848461,China's 'socialist market economy' 30 years on,"Thirty years ago, on March 29, 1993, China formally amended its constitution and adopted the ""socialist market economy"" as the country's economic system.The move marked a significant step in the nation's decades-long economic ""reform and opening-up"" process, which began in 1978 following years of political, social and economic upheaval caused by the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution.It laid the foundation for the ""development of the socialist rule of law,"" and by incorporating the concept into the constitution, shaped the direction of China's economic development, according to the People's Daily, the newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party's Central Committee.""China's first real major economic reform began in the rural areas in the 1980s, when state-run factories were converted into private ones and some local officials began their own small factories,"" said Dexter Roberts, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council's Indo-Pacific Security Initiative.According to Jane Golley, an economist at the Australian National University (ANU), this first wave of economic opening-up boosted rural incomes and facilitated some migration of China's vast rural population.The agricultural reforms and the establishment of special economic zones also helped, she added.The reform and opening-up process accelerated after Deng Xiaoping, China's paramount leader at the time, embarked on his famous ""southern tour"" in early 1992, when he visited key coastal cities and delivered speeches highlighting the need to remain steadfast on the reform path.Following the tour, the focus of economic reform shifted from rural to urban areas.Roberts from the Atlantic Council told DW that one important feature of China's urban economic reform was that the Communist Party gave entrepreneurs and enterprises more autonomy to make decisions.""Entrepreneurs took things into their own hands and they began to decide what they wanted to produce or what they wanted to sell,"" he said.In the subsequent years, China carried out a series of industrial reforms, including the prominent program of ""Grasp the Large and Let Go of the Small,"" in which the government tried to maintain control over some of the largest state-owned enterprises (SOE) while giving up control over smaller SOEs.Jiang Zemin, China's president from 1993 to 2003, oversaw rapid economic growth, and also changed the constitution to let private entrepreneurs and enterprises play a more important role in the economy, Roberts said.""Jiang allowed private entrepreneurs to become party members, which was a huge deal,"" he noted.In 2001, China joined the World Trade Organization, another pivotal moment that further opened the Asian nation up to the global economy. ""It was a very long process that involved significant commitment [from China] to play the game more in line with the global economic order,"" Golley from ANU said.Andrew Collier, managing director at Orient Capital Research, said that joining the WTO accelerated Chinese growth and turned the country into a global industrial powerhouse.During the first decade of this century, China relied on exports, infrastructure investment and the property market to maintain a high-level economic growth.In 2010, China officially overtook Japan to become the world's second-largest economy, based on nominal GDP.However, problems began to surface as external demand dropped, debt started to pile up and corruption became rampant.And Xi Jinping, China's leader since late 2012, has been reasserting the CCP's control over the economy, weakening the hand of private businesspeople and tech entrepreneurs, whom he views as becoming too powerful and contributing to widening wealth inequality.Roberts said Xi's move risks ""damaging China's growth model for the last few decades.""""His goal is to have an economy that still has a strong private sector but one that's far more controlled,"" he told DW. ""I think that's a bridge too far. He can't have both of those things at the same time.""Collier said Xi appears to have recognized the need for China to transform its investment-driven economic model to a consumer-driven model.But his political decisions, which include doubling down on the state sector, will hurt Beijing's ability to restructure its economy, he underlined.""Xi is not interested in defunding the state sector in order to give consumers a larger share of the economy,"" he pointed out.""The crackdown on the platform economy is an indication of that. It's a very successful sector and there may have been some market-dominance issues. But instead of addressing them in a regulatory matter, what China did is a wholesale cutback of the industry because it's viewed as a threat to the Party.""Over the last three years, the economy has been battered by the coronavirus pandemic and the government's strict zero-COVID strategy to counter the health emergency.The government has set a modest target for economic growth this year of around 5% after it cooled to only 3% last year, one of the weakest showings in nearly half a century.""A lot of China's growth is beset by debt and inefficient state investment,"" Collier said. ""The debt load is now becoming quite a burden and the inefficiency has increased. I'm very concerned about China's ability to sustain medium-term growth or growth at all potentially.""Economic activity, however, picked up in the first two months of this year, helped by increased consumption and infrastructure investment.But exports are expected to remain weak amid a global downturn and the crisis-hit property sector is only slowly beginning to turn the corner.Meanwhile, Xi is overseeing a broad reorganization of governing bodies that is set to give the ruling party direct control and supervision over financial affairs — by creating the Central Financial Commission.To strengthen the ideological and political role of the party in China's overall financial system, a separate Central Financial Work Commission will also be established.Apart from strengthening the party's control over the economy, Collier said there is no advantage with these reforms, as it is ""not going to be positive for growth going forward.""At the twice-a-decade party congress last year, Xi installed his loyalists to top positions in the CCP. He appointed his close ally Li Qiang as the new premier this month. Roberts said he doesn't expect anyone in the senior leadership to stand up to Xi and act independently.""It's a huge problem having a lineup of leadership whose careers are so beholden to Xi,"" he told DW. ""I don't expect Li Qiang to be independent and I wouldn't expect him to stand up and challenge Xi Jinping.""Edited by: Srinivas Mazumdaru",2023/03/27,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848462,Could the US and China bring peace to Ukraine?,"Possibly the only person in the world who has any real influence on Vladimir Putin is his self-declared friend Xi Jinping. China's leader did not let Putin's arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court stop him from visiting Moscow recently.China's influence in Moscow stems from diplomatic decisions and economic dependence: China, the world's second most important economy, has yet to condemn the Russian invasion of Ukraine. And while the West is imposing ever tougher sanctions on Russia, China is doing the opposite and expanding its trade with Moscow.""Actually, Russia's brutal war of aggression is not in China's interest,"" Henning Hoff, executive editor of Internationale Politik Quarterly, told DW. ""The war is disrupting China's economic recovery after three 'zero-covid' years. And given how the war is going, Beijing is in danger of ending up on the losing side.""But China is trying to ""reap its economic benefits from the war and its aftermath,"" for example, by buying discounted oil and gas from Russia. Conversely, China may increase its exports to Russia at a time when trade relations with the West are becoming more difficult. The United States believes that this includes civilian technical equipment that could be used militarily.As a result, Russia is becoming more dependent on China, which means that Beijing has leverage over Moscow that no one else has. Xi could persuade Putin to negotiate an end to the war if he wanted to. But so far, the Chinese leader has shown the Russian president a red line on only one point: Using nuclear weapons.But there is an overriding Chinese interest that is even greater than the war: China wants Russia as a partner to enforce a world order without Western dominance, which means that, from China's perspective, Russia must not lose the war. It would also be bad for Xi if the Putin regime were to fail, because that would be a setback for the authoritarian model to which he is also committed.Externally, China is trying to act as a peace broker in the Ukraine war. However, a peace plan presented by a Chinese government representative at the Munich Security Conference in February was rejected by Western governments for being too vague, and lacking a call for a Russian troop withdrawal from Ukraine, an essential precondition for both Kyiv and the West.Xi's Moscow visit was accompanied by much peace rhetoric in the Chinese media, though Xi did not mention the war at all there in public. And Putin seemed to play along to some extent: ""Russia is open to settling the Ukraine crisis by political-diplomatic means,"" he wrote in an article for the Chinese People's Daily shortly before the visit.But in the same article, Putin insisted that Kyiv must recognize ""new geopolitical realities"" with Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and four Ukrainian regions last year. However, at least Putin did not talk of Ukraine being an illegitimate state ruled by Nazis that had to be annexed by Russia, as he has done in the past.What can be expected from China in the search for peace? Not much at the moment, said Wolfgang Ischinger, the former head of the Munich Security Conference, and formerly a leading German diplomat. ""Because of the current tense atmosphere between the US and China, China has little incentive at the moment to reduce its proximity to Russia,"" he told DW.He added that if the war drags on even longer, further weakening Russia militarily, economically and politically, Russia will become even more dependent on China. ""From the Chinese point of view, that might not be a bad development at all,"" Ischinger said.So any pressure to seek peace between Russia and Ukraine is not currently coming from China, nor from the warring parties themselves. In what is developing into a war of attrition, both sides apparently still believe they can win decisively militarily.That pressure to make peace is more likely to come from Ukraine's Western backers. Their populations are clearly feeling the economic effects of the war in the form of energy shortages, inflation, and strained public budgets, leaving states with less money.In Germany, fear of war is also on the rise. In a R+V Insurance survey published a few days ago, 63% of Germans fear that the country is not capable of defending itself, and 55% of respondents are worried that Germany will become involved in a war, an increase of 13 points from 2022.Meanwhile, in the United States, Ukraine's most important supporter by a long way, willingness to continue helping the European country so generously when there is little prospect of peace is waning, among the population at large and in Congress among Republicans. That makes it politically risky in the longer term for President Joseph Biden, who recently pledged support to Ukraine ""for as long as it takes"" in Kyiv.Writing in Foreign Policy magazine, Stephen Walt said that Biden had thus tied his political fate to the outcome of the war, arguing that, measured against what he has promised, anything less than complete victory will look like failure. And if China becomes even more supportive of Russia, Biden may feel compelled to impose further sanctions on China, which in turn would jeopardize US economic recovery. And then, Walt writes, potential Republican presidential contenders would be hoping for a 2024 victory.War fatigue in the US is already having an impact on the Biden administration: Questioned by a Republican member of Congress, Secretary of State Antony Blinken now hinted for the first time that Ukraine might not be able to retake all Russian-occupied territory. That was itself a taboo-breaking statement.For both Washington and Beijing, the Ukraine war is ultimately just part of a larger confrontation between two countries, one democratic and one autocratic. And in this growing confrontation, Henning Hoff believes, ""Germany and Europe will have to position themselves more strongly, and seek solidarity with the Americans on more issues than before.""Another consequence of this confrontation for the Europeans is the ""urgently needed greater European contribution in terms of military security, also so that the Americans can focus more on the Indo-Pacific.""The US, as the key supporter, has the most influence over Ukraine, and China the most (perhaps the only) influence over the Kremlin. At a recent EU summit, it was of all people Xavier Bettel, the prime minister of Luxembourg, who urged Joe Biden to negotiate a peace plan on Ukraine with Xi Jinping. The other states would accept that, Bettel said.That is probably what many EU states would prefer: that the two big players in world politics solve the Ukraine-Russia problem among themselves, and thus also for the Europeans.This article was originally written in German.While you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

The decision by the Turkish parliament followed Hungary’s ratification of Finland’s bid earlier in the week.The addition of Finland, which shares a 1,340 kilometer (832 mile) border with Russia, will more than double the size of NATO’s border with Russia.However, a few more steps and procedures are required before the northern European nation becomes the 31st full NATO member:ACCEPTANCE LETTERSTurkey and Hungary dispatch acceptance letters to the United States which is the depositary, or safekeeper, of NATO under the alliance’s 1949 founding treaty. The letters will be filed in the archives of the U.S. State Department, which will notify NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg that the conditions for inviting Finland to become a member were met.INVITATIONNATO sends a letter signed by Stoltenberg inviting Finland to join the military alliance.SIGNATURESFinland sends its own acceptance document, signed by Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto, to the U.S. State Department. Finnish President Sauli Niinistö authorized Haavisto to sign the document. Either the Finnish Embassy in Washington or a Finnish government official will deliver the document.FULL MEMBERSHIPOnce Finland’s membership acceptance document reaches the State Department in Washington, the country officially becomes a NATO member.FINLAND-SWEDENFinland and neighboring Sweden jointly applied for NATO membership in May 2022. The countries, which have close cultural, economic and political ties, planned to enter the alliance simultaneously.Sweden’s bid, however, has stalled due to opposition from Turkey, whose president has said his country wouldn’t ratify membership before its disputes with Stockholm were resolved. The Turkish government has accused Sweden of being too soft on groups that it deems to be terror organizations.In his first reaction to the Turkish parliamentary vote, Sweden's Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson congratulated Finland.“It would have been even better if we came in at the same time,” he said, adding that there are no guarantees Sweden will be in by the NATO July summit in Vilnius, Lithuania's capital, as initially expected.“We are now awaiting the Turkish election” in May, Kristersson said. “There is a significant part in this that also deals with Turkish domestic politics.”Hungary’s parliament also has yet to ratify Sweden’s accession to NATO, and it remains unclear when it will do so.",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848476,Why does Russia want tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus?,"Russian President Vladimir Putin's announcement that he intends to deploy tactical nuclear weapons on the territory of Belarus appears to be another attempt to raise the stakes in the conflict in Ukraine.It follows Putin's warnings that Moscow is ready to use “all available means” to fend off attacks on Russian territory, a reference to its nuclear arsenal.A look at Putin’s statement and its implications:HOW DID PUTIN EXPLAIN HIS MOVE?Putin said that President Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus has long urged Moscow to station its nuclear weapons in his country, which has close military ties with Russia and was a staging ground for the invasion of neighboring Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022.Russia already has helped modernize Belarusian warplanes to make them capable of carrying nuclear weapons — something that Belarus' authoritarian leader has repeatedly mentioned.In remarks broadcast Saturday, Putin said the immediate trigger for the deployment of Russia's tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus was the U.K. government's decision to provide Ukraine with armor-piercing shells containing depleted uranium. Putin toned down his language after first falsely claiming that such rounds have nuclear components, but he insisted they pose an additional danger to the civilian population and could contaminate the environment.Putin also said that by stationing tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, Russia will be doing what the United States has done for decades by putting its nuclear weapons in Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Turkey. He alleged the Russian move doesn’t violate an international treaty banning the proliferation of nuclear weapons, even though Moscow has argued before that Washington has breached the pact by deploying them on the territory of its NATO allies.Putin’s move contrasted with a statement that he and Chinese President Xi Jinping issued after their talks in the Kremlin last week, which spoke against nuclear powers deploying atomic weapons outside their territories, in an apparent jab at the U.S.WHAT ARE TACTICAL NUCLEAR WEAPONS?Tactical nuclear weapons are intended to destroy enemy troops and weapons on the battlefield. They have a relatively short range and a much lower yield than nuclear warheads fitted to long-range strategic missiles that are capable of obliterating whole cities.Unlike strategic weapons, which have been subject to arms control agreements between Moscow and Washington, tactical weapons never have been limited by any such pacts, and Russia hasn’t released their numbers or any other specifics related to them.The U.S. government believes Russia has about 2,000 tactical nuclear weapons, which include bombs that can be carried by aircraft, warheads for short-range missiles and artillery rounds.While strategic nuclear weapons are fitted to land- or submarine-based intercontinental ballistic missiles that are constantly ready for launch, tactical nuclear weapons are stored at a few tightly guarded storage facilities in Russia, and it takes time to deliver them to combat units.Some Russian hawks long have urged the Kremlin to send a warning to the West by moving some tactical nuclear weapons closer to the aircraft and missiles intended to deliver them.WHAT EXACTLY WILL RUSSIA DO?Putin said that Russia already has helped upgrade 10 Belarusian aircraft to allow them to carry nuclear weapons and their crews will start training to use them from April 3. He noted Russia also has given Belarus the Iskander short-range missile systems that can be fitted with conventional or nuclear warheads.He said the construction of storage facilities for nuclear weapons in Belarus will be completed by July 1. He didn’t say how many nuclear weapons will be stationed there or when they will be deployed.Putin emphasized that Russia will retain control over any nuclear weapons deployed to Belarus, just like the U.S. controls its tactical nuclear weapons on the territory of its NATO allies.If Moscow sends nuclear weapons to Belarus, it will mark their first deployment outside Russian borders since the early 1990s. Belarus, Ukraine and Kazakhstan inherited massive nuclear arsenals after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 but agreed to ship them to Russia in the following years.WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES BEHIND PUTIN’S MOVE?With his latest statement, Putin again is dangling the nuclear threat to signal Moscow’s readiness to escalate the war in Ukraine.The deployment of tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, which has a 1,084-kilometer (673-mile) border with Ukraine, would allow Russian aircraft and missiles to reach potential targets there more easily and quickly if Moscow decides to use them. It would also extend Russia’s capability to target several NATO members in Eastern and Central Europe.The move comes as Kyiv is poised for a counteroffensive to reclaim territory occupied by Russia.Dmitry Medvedev, deputy head of Russia’s Security Council, warned last week that attempts by Ukraine to reclaim control over the Crimean Peninsula was a threat to “the very existence of the Russian state,” something that warrants a nuclear response under the country’s security doctrine. Russia illegally annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014.“Every day of supplying Western weapons to Ukraine makes the nuclear apocalypse closer,” Medvedev said.Ukrainian military analyst Oleh Zhdanov said that Putin's goal is to discourage Ukraine’s Western allies from providing Kyiv with more weapons before any counteroffensive.Putin is ""using nuclear blackmail in a bid to influence the situation on the battlefield and force Western partners to reduce supplies of weapons and equipment under the threat of nuclear escalation,” Zhdanov said. “The Belarusian nuclear balcony will be looming over not only Ukraine, but Europe as well, creating a constant threat, raising tensions and rattling the nerves of Ukrainians and their Western partners.”WHAT ARE UKRAINE AND THE WEST SAYING?Ukraine has responded to Putin’s move by calling for an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council. A U.N. spokesman referred questions on the issue to the Security Council, which had announced no meeting on it by Monday afternoon.“The world must be united against someone who endangers the future of human civilization,” the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said.White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Monday that U.S. officials “haven’t seen any movement of any tactical nuclear weapons or anything of that kind” since Putin's announcement on Belarus. He has said Washington has seen nothing to prompt a change in its strategic deterrent posture.NATO rejects Putin’s claim that Russia only is doing what the U.S. has done for decades, saying that Western allies act with full respect for their international commitments.“Russia’s nuclear rhetoric is dangerous and irresponsible,” NATO spokesperson Oana Lungescu said, adding that the alliance hasn’t yet seen any change in Russia’s nuclear posture.Lithuania, which borders Belarus, described Putin’s statement as “yet another attempt by two unpredictable dictatorial regimes to threaten their neighbors and the entire European continent,” calling them “desperate moves by Putin and Lukashenko to create another wave of tension and destabilization in Europe.”Belarus' Foreign Ministry rejected Western criticism Tuesday, casting the deployment of Russian nuclear weapons as a response to “unprecedented” Western pressure and arguing that the move wouldn't contradict the international agreements because Russia will retain control of them.The Russian Foreign Ministry pointed out that Washington and its allies had ignored Russia's calls for the withdrawal of U.S. nuclear weapons from Europe. It reaffirmed Moscow’s right to take “the necessary additional steps to ensure security of Russia and its allies.""___Aamer Madhani in Washington, and Yuras Karmanau in Tallinn, Estonia, contributed to this report.___Follow AP's coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",2023/03/28,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848478,Foes of Kentucky transgender bill push back with radio ads,"FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) — A well-known Kentucky Republican on Monday blasted the GOP's push for transgender legislation, calling it “a bad look for the party of Abraham Lincoln” in a radio ad coming days before lawmakers could vote to override the Democratic governor's veto of the bill.Former longtime GOP state lawmaker Bob Heleringer evoked Lincoln's memory and words in lashing out against the Republican measure. A companion radio ad features Trey Grayson, a former Republican secretary of state in Kentucky. The Fairness Campaign, an LGBTQ+ advocacy organization in Kentucky, paid for the commercials, which are airing statewide.It's part of an uphill effort by the bill's opponents to try to fend off an override of Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear's veto of the measure aimed at regulating the lives of transgender youths. The bill would ban access to gender-affirming health care and restrict the bathrooms they can use. It also would allow teachers to refuse to refer to transgender students by the pronouns they use.The bill easily passed with veto-proof margins in the legislature — where Republicans have supermajorities in both chambers. Lawmakers are set to reconvene Wednesday for the final two days of this year’s session, when they could vote to push aside Beshear's veto. Senate Majority Floor Leader Damon Thayer said Monday that the ads would not slow the bill's momentum among legislators.The supporters say they are trying to protect children from undertaking gender-affirming treatments they might regret as adults. Research shows such regret is rare.The Family Foundation, a faith-based organization in Kentucky, is urging lawmakers to override the veto. It said Beshear put “radical sexual ideology above protecting Kentucky children from harm.”Heleringer pushed back against his party's efforts throughout the session. In one of the new ads, he asks if the GOP worked for years to gain legislative majorities in Kentucky ""just to wage an all-out war against defenseless transgender children? Wow, what a bad look for the party of Abraham Lincoln.”In the ad featuring Grayson, the ex-statewide official says he can’t believe lawmakers are “working in the final days to take rights away from Kentucky parents” by pushing the transgender bill.“They want to overrule parents and doctors when it comes to care for transgender kids,” he said in urging Kentuckians to contact their lawmakers to speak out against the bill.It's similar to the arguments made by the governor, who says the bill “tears away the freedom of parents to make critical and difficult medical decisions for their children.”The legislation in Kentucky is part of a national movement, with Republican state lawmakers approving extensive measures that restrict the rights of LGBTQ+ people this year, from bills targeting transgender athletes and drag performers to measures limiting gender-affirming care.The Kentucky measure would ban gender-affirming care for transgender minors. It would outlaw gender reassignment surgery for anyone under 18, as well as the use of puberty blockers and hormones, and inpatient and outpatient gender-affirming hospital services.Doctors would have to set a timeline to “detransition” children already taking puberty blockers or undergoing hormone therapy. They could continue offering care as they taper a youngster’s treatments, if removing them from the treatment immediately could harm the child.Transgender medical treatments have long been available in the United States and are endorsed by major medical associations.The bill would not allow schools to discuss sexual orientation or gender identity with students of any age. It would require school districts to devise bathroom policies that, “at a minimum,” would not allow transgender children to use the bathroom aligned with their gender identities. It also would require schools to notify parents when lessons related to human sexuality are going to be taught.Chris Hartman, executive director of the Fairness Campaign, said featuring well-known Republicans in the ads was “intentional for us to show the support on both sides of the aisle, which we know exists” in opposing the bill. Both Heleringer and Grayson have lobbied on behalf of issues important to the Fairness Campaign, he said.Thayer took issue with the strategy, saying it “crosses a line.”“They have a First Amendment right to say whatever they want, but it’s extremely rare for registered lobbyists to appear in an advertising campaign,” Thayer said.",2023/03/28,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848481,"No atmosphere found at faraway Earth-sized world, study says","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — The Webb Space Telescope has found no evidence of an atmosphere at one of the seven rocky, Earth-sized planets orbiting another star.Scientists said Monday that doesn’t bode well for the rest of the planets in this solar system, some of which are in the sweet spot for harboring water and potentially life.“This is not necessarily a bust” for the other planets, Massachusetts Institute of Technology astrophysicist Sara Seager, who wasn't part of the study, said in an email. “But we will have to wait and see.”The Trappist solar system — a rarity with seven planets about the size of our own — has enticed astronomers ever since they spotted it just 40 light-years away. That's close by cosmic standards; a light-year is about 5.8 trillion miles. Three of the seven planets are in their star's habitable zone, making this star system even more alluring.The NASA-led team reported little if any atmosphere exists at the innermost planet. Results were published Monday in the journal Nature.The lack of an atmosphere would mean no water and no protection from cosmic rays, said lead researcher Thomas Greene of NASA's Ames Research Center.As for the other planets orbiting the small, feeble Trappist star, “I would have been more optimistic about the others” having atmospheres if this one had, Greene said in an email.If rocky planets orbiting ultracool red dwarf stars like this one “do turn out to be a bust, we will have to wait for Earths around sun-like stars, which could be a long wait,"" said MIT’s Seager.Because the Trappist system's innermost planet is bombarded by solar radiation — four times as much as Earth gets from our sun — it's possible that extra energy is why there's no atmosphere, Greene noted. His team found temperatures there hitting 450 degrees Fahrenheit (230 degrees Celsius) on the side of the planet constantly facing its star.By using Webb — the largest and most powerful telescope ever sent into space — the U.S. and French scientists were able to measure the change in brightness as the innermost planet moved behind its star and estimate how much infrared light was emitted from the planet.The change in brightness was miniscule since the Trappist star is more than 1,000 times brighter than this planet, and so Webb's detection of it “is itself a major milestone,” the European Space Agency said.More observations are planned not only of this planet, but the others in the Trappist system. Looking at this particular planet in another wavelength could uncover an atmosphere much thinner than our own, although it seems unlikely it could survive, said Taylor Bell of the Bay Area Environmental Research Institute, who was part of the study.Further research could still uncover an atmosphere of sorts, even if it's not exactly like what's seen on Earth, said Michael Gillon of the University of Liege in Belgium who was part of the team that discovered the first three Trappist planets in 2016. He did not take part in the latest study.“With rocky exoplanets, we are in uncharted territory"" since scientists' understanding is based on the four rocky planets of our solar system, Gillon said in an email.Launched in late 2021 to an observation post 1 million miles (1.6 million kilometers) away, Webb is considered the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, orbiting Earth for more than three decades.In the past, Hubble and the Spitzer Space Telescope scoured the Trappist system for atmospheres, but without definitive results.“It is just the beginning, and what we can learn with the inner planets is going to be different from what we can learn from the other ones,” MIT's Julien de Wit, who was not involved in the study, said in an email.___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848482,Villanova All-American Siegrist declares for WNBA draft,"VILLANOVA, Pa. (AP) — Villanova star and AP All-American Maddy Siegrist will not return for a fifth season and has declared for the WNBA draft.Siegrist led Villanova to a 30-7 overall record and the Sweet 16 for the second time ever this season. She led the country in scoring at 29.2 points per game and averaged 9.2 rebounds. She's the two-time Big East Player of the Year.Siegrist played four seasons and is the career leading scorer in Villanova basketball history for both men and women with 2,896 points. She also became the career leading scorer in Big East history for men and women with 1,693 points, in regular-season conference games only.“I can’t thank Villanova enough for welcoming me into the greatest community on Earth,"" Siegrist said. ""From the first day I stepped on campus, I knew this would be my forever home. My college basketball career was everything that I dreamed of and more. However, when I look back on my career it is the people at Villanova and the relationships that I made that I am going to cherish forever.”The NCAA granted athletes affected by the COVID-19 pandemic an extra season of eligibility. Siegrist decided the time was right to jump to the WNBA.The Wildcats lost to Miami in the Sweet 16, meaning Siegrist had until Monday's deadline to decide if she would return for another season or declare for the draft. Players on teams still alive in the NCAA Tournament have 48 hours after their final game to make a decision. The WNBA draft is April 10.Siegrist scored 20 or more points in all 37 games this season, including 17 games of 30 points or more. The 37 consecutive 20-point game stretch is the longest streak by any women’s or men’s Division I player this century. She scored a career-best 50 points against Seton Hall on Feb. 11 on 20-of-26 shooting.“The statistical numbers that she recorded are going to be there forever which is so special when you see what Maddy accomplished throughout her amazing career,” Villanova coach Denise Dillon said.“With that said, when you leave your mark on people as Maddy has there is nothing greater. I think that is by far the greatest accomplishment as a student-athlete where you can be recognized as being an authentic person as opposed to just a great athlete. Maddy will continue to impact the world in whatever she does.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848483,Hungarian parliament approves Finland’s bid to join NATO,"BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — Hungary’s parliament on Monday approved Finland’s bid to join NATO, putting an end to months of delays and bringing the Nordic country one step closer to becoming a full member of the Western military alliance.The measure, passed with 182 votes for and six against, came after Hungary’s government had for months frustrated allies in NATO and the European Union by repeatedly postponing the vote after nearly all other alliance members ratified Finland’s bid.While Hungary’s approval was greeted with relief in Helsinki and elsewhere, NATO accession for Sweden remained up in the air as members of Hungary’s governing party insisted they will wait for Stockholm to clear up lingering disagreements before they go to a vote. Finland and Sweden jointly applied for membership following Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine.Adding to the uncertainly over Sweden’s bid are Turkey’s own objections amid accusations that Stockholm is too soft on groups that it deems to be terror organizations.Agnes Vadai, a lawmaker with Hungary’s opposition Democratic Coalition party, said Monday that the governing Fidesz party had been using “pretexts” to delay ratification for the two countries, and that further stalling could push a vote on Sweden into early April or even May.“There is no real reason for not supporting these countries,” Vadai, a former secretary of state in Hungary’s ministry of defense, told The Associated Press. “NATO accession shouldn’t be a question of personal feelings and blackmailing.”Turkey is now the only one of the 30 NATO members not to have ratified Finland’s accession. Full unanimity is required to admit a new member into the alliance.However, Turkey’s parliamentary committee on foreign affairs last week approved Finland’s NATO membership application, and a vote on accession is expected to be held before Turkey’s presidential and parliamentary elections on May 14.While Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has long signaled his country’s support for NATO expansion, his government has alleged that Swedish and Finnish politicians have told “blatant lies” about the condition of Hungary’s democracy which has left some ruling party lawmakers unsure of whether to support the accession bids.In an interview with the AP at the United Nations Friday, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said the West’s steady criticism of Hungary on democratic and cultural issues had made its government reluctant to offer support on practical matters, specifically NATO’s buildup against Russia.The EU, which includes 21 NATO countries, has for years accused Orban’s government of cracking down on media freedom and LGBTQ rights, overseeing an entrenched culture of official corruption and co-opting state institutions to serve the interests of the governing Fidesz party.Some Hungarian opposition politicians and analysts believe the country’s foot-dragging on ratification had aimed at pushing Sweden and Finland to support the release of billions in EU funds earmarked for Budapest that have been frozen over alleged breaches of the bloc’s rule-of-law standards.But Samuel Agoston Mraz, director of the pro-government Nezopont Intezet thinktank in Budapest, said Hungary won’t make a move regarding Sweden until Turkey decides on whether to approve the country’s NATO membership bid.Mraz said Hungary “does not want to make decisions against the Turks” and also wants guarantees from Stockholm on improving bilateral relations.“Hungary is a supporter of a unified NATO. It does not believe in Turkey versus all the other member states,” Mraz told the AP.___Associated Press writer Suzan Fraser in Ankara, Turkey contributed to this report.",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848484,What can Google's AI-powered Bard do? We tested it for you,"To use, or not to use, Bard? That is the Shakespearean question an Associated Press reporter sought to answer while testing out Google's artificially intelligent chatbot.The recently rolled-out bot dubbed Bard is the internet search giant's answer to the ChatGPT tool that Microsoft has been melding into its Bing search engine and other software.During several hours of interaction, the AP learned Bard is quite forthcoming about its unreliability and other shortcomings, including its potential for mischief in next year’s U.S. presidential election. Even as it occasionally warned of the problems it could unleash, Bard repeatedly emphasized its belief that it will blossom into a force for good.At one point in its recurring soliloquies about its potential upsides, Bard dreamed about living up to the legacy of the English playwright that inspired its name.Bard explained that its creators at Google “thought Shakespeare would be a good role model for me, as he was a master of language and communication.”But the chatbot also found some admirable traits in “HAL,” the fictional computer that killed some of a spacecraft's crew in the 1968 movie “2001: A Space Odyssey."" Bard hailed HAL's intelligence calling it “an interesting character” before acknowledging its dark side.“I think HAL is a cautionary tale about the dangers of artificial intelligence,"" Bard assessed.WHAT'S BETTER — BARD OR BING?Bard praised ChatGPT, describing it as ""a valuable tool that can be used for a variety of purposes, and I am excited to see how it continues to develop in the future."" But Bard then asserted that it is just as intelligent as its rival, which was released late last year by its creator, the Microsoft-backed OpenAI.“I would say that I am on par with ChatGPT,"" Bard said. “We both have our own strengths and weaknesses, and we both have the ability to learn and grow.""During our wide-ranging conversation, Bard didn't display any of the disturbing tendencies that have cropped up in ChatGPT, which has likened another AP reporter to Hitler and tried to persuade a New York Times reporter to divorce his wife.IT'S FUNNY, BUT TAMER THAN BINGBard did get a little gooey at one point when asked to write a Shakespearean sonnet and responded seductively in one of the three drafts that it quickly created.“I love you more than words can ever say, And I will always be there for you,"" Bard effused. “You are my everything, And I will never let you go. So please accept this sonnet as a token Of my love for you, And know that I will always be yours.""But Bard seems to be deliberately tame most of the time, and probably for good reason, given what's at stake for Google, which has carefully cultivated a reputation for trustworthiness that has established its dominant search engine as the de facto gateway to the internet.An artificial intelligence tool that behaved as erratically as ChatGPT periodically might trigger a backlash that could damage Google's image and perhaps undercut its search engine, the hub of a digital advertising empire that generated more than $220 billion in revenue last year. Microsoft, in contrast, can afford to take more risks with the edgier ChatGPT because it makes more of its money from licensing software for personal computers.BARD ADMITS IT'S NOT PERFECTGoogle has programmed Bard to ensure it warns its users that it's prone to mistakes.Some inaccuracies are fairly easy to spot. For instance, when asked for some information about the AP reporter questioning it, Bard got most of the basics right, most likely by plucking tidbits from profiles posted on LinkedIn and Twitter.But Bard mysteriously also spit out inaccuracies about this reporter's academic background (describing him as a graduate of University of California, Berkeley, instead of San Jose State University) and professional background (incorrectly stating that he began his career at The Wall Street Journal before also working at The New York Times and The Washington Post).When asked to produce a short story about disgraced Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes, Bard summed up most of the highlights and lowlights of her saga. But one of Bard's three drafts incorrectly reported that Holmes was convicted of all the felony charges of fraud and conspiracy leveled against her during a four-month trial. Another version accurately reported Holmes was convicted on four counts of fraud and conspiracy without mentioning she was acquitted on four other charges (the jury hung on three other charges that were subsequently dismissed by prosecutors).“I am still under development, and I am not perfect,” Bard cautioned at one point. “I can sometimes make mistakes, and I can sometimes be misunderstood. I am also aware that my technology can be used for both good and evil.""WHAT'S NEXT FOR BARD?Although Bard insisted it doesn't have a dark side, it acknowledged it can be used to damage reputations, disseminate propaganda that could incite violence and manipulate elections.“I could be used to create fake news articles or social media posts that could spread misinformation about candidates or their policies,” Bard warned. “I could also be used to suppress voter turnout by spreading discouraging messages or making it difficult for people to find information about how to vote.”On the lighter side, Bard proved helpful in finding interesting coloring books for adults and hit some notes that resonated during a discussion of rock and roll. When asked who is the greatest guitarist of all time, Bard responded with a broad list of candidates ranging from well-known rock artists such as Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin to jazz virtuosos like Django Reinhardt before making the case for Jimi Hendrix “as a strong contender for the title, his music continues to influence and inspire guitarists around the world.”Bard also seemed familiar with contemporary artists, such as Wet Leg, which recently won a Grammy award for best alternative music album. ""I’ve been listening to their debut album a lot lately and I really enjoy it. I think they have a bright future ahead of them,"" Bard said, and cited “Ur Mom” and “Chaise Longue” as its favorite songs by the group so far.Even with Bard's occasional miscues, it seemed savvy enough to ask about its potential role in reaching the singularity, a term popularized by computer scientist and author Ray Kurzweil to describe a turning point in the future when computers will be smarter than humans.“Some people believe that I am a big step toward the singularity,"" Bard said. “I believe that I am a valuable tool that can help people to learn and understand the world around them. However, I do not believe that I am the singularity, and I do not believe that I will ever be able to replace human intelligence.”",2023/03/28,124,World

The suspected attacker was detained and the state's military police is investigating.“Our efforts are concentrated on helping the wounded and comforting the family members,” Gov. Tarcísio de Freitas wrote on social media.A student who spoke to reporters alongside his mother outside the school said the attacker had insulted another student last week, and that the female teacher he fatally stabbed had tried to settle the conflict.The attacker had called the other student a “rat,” and “the other one did not like it, and they began fighting,” said Gabriel Livramento, 13, who is in the same class as the suspect. He added that the attacker did not like the way the teacher had intervened and had said he would do something about it.The attacker entered class Monday wearing a skull mask and stabbed the teacher from behind, hitting her head and back, Livramento said.

I couldn't have asked for any more.”Hogg came through Scotland's age groups and made his senior debut in the 2012 Six Nations. He was player of the tournament in 2016 and 2017. He was named captain in 2020 and held the job until a year ago when his form and discipline dropped.He was back playing well in the just-finished Six Nations.“Knowing what lies ahead, I have a real hunger to play the best, most enjoyable rugby of my career, finishing the season strongly with Exeter Chiefs before attacking the opportunity we, as a nation, have in France,” he wrote.“After the tournament, a new career beckons and I will attack it in the same manner as I play the game.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848487,"MLB 2023: New rules, big money Mets, Ohtani's walk year","Baseball has transformed in the 145 days since Dusty Baker and the Houston Astros sealed the franchise's second title in six seasons.As New York Mets owner Steve Cohen dominated an offseason that saw billions spent, the sport braced for a new world that includes pitch clocks, bigger bases, limits on defensive shifts and pickoff throws, and an overarching attempt to reverse decades of lengthening games and the Analytics Era domination of the Three True Outcomes — strikeouts, walks and home runs.“Late-inning relievers more than anyone will have to figure some things out and make some adjustments,” Minnesota Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said. “Left-handed hitters, it’s going to help them, period.”Last year's average game time was 3 hours, 4 minutes after the introduction of the PitchCom electronic device to signal pitches, down from a record 3:10 in 2021. MLB’s average was 2:46 in 2005 and 2:33 in 1981. A pitch clock of 15 seconds with no runners on base and 20 seconds with runners is designed to cut game times considerably.Higher pitch velocity and increased shifts led to the major league batting average dropping to .243, its lowest since 1968. The only seasons with lower averages were the record bottom of .237 in 1968 along with 1967 and the dead-ball era seasons of 1884, 1888 and 1908.Over the objections of players, the sport’s 11-man competition committee adopted a rule that two infielders are required to be on either side of second and all infielders to be within the outer boundary of the infield when the pitcher is on the rubber. Bases were increased from 15-inch squares to 18-by-18, which shorten the distance by 4 1/2 inches and may lead to increased stolen bases.In spring training through Sunday, games time averaged 2:35 in a drop from 3:01. Runs fell from 10.6 per game to 10.2 and batting average from .259 to .256, but batting average on balls in play rose to .325 from .314 for lefty hitters while remaining .311 for righties.No player will be watched more closely this season than Shohei Ohtani, a two-way megastar in the final year under contract with the Los Angeles Angels. He and three-time MVP teammate Mike Trout nave have played in a postseason game together. Ohtani has made it clear he wants to win. A taste of October might be needed to persuade the Japanese sensation to remain with the franchise.Other storylines to watch include Aaron Judge's ascent to Yankee captaincy — the first since Derek Jeter — after his 62-homer season; Fernando Tatis Jr., set to return from a drug suspension on April 20, teaming with Manny Machado to try leading the Padres to their first World Series title; and can Carlos Correa remain healthy with Minnesota after San Francisco and the Mets backed out of deals with the All-Star shortstop?Five areas to focus on as the 2023 season starts Thursday:LEFT-HANDED HITTERSBatting average for left-handed hitters was .236 last year, down from .254 in 2016, when lefties were one point below the big league average.An early focus will be on which left-handed hitters benefit most from the new shift restrictions. Among those who could be helped are Corey Seager, Kyle Schwarber, Anthony Rizzo, Cody Bellinger, Rowdy Tellez and Yordan Álvarez.Teams still are allowed to position outfielders as they wish, so some managers may experiment with moving the left fielder into short right with certain lefties at the plate.BASEBALL ‘BILLIONS’Cohen inspired the character of Bobby Axelrod, who returns to Showtime's “Billions” in Season 7. Season 3 of the Mets under Cohen should be as interesting as the television drama.New York raised its payroll to a projected $370 million and is set to shatter the record, set by the 2015 Los Angeles Dodgers at $291 million, while also paying a luxury tax on track to be $116 million. The Mets added Justin Verlander, José Quintana, Kodai Senga, David Robertson and Omar Narváez while losing Jacob deGrom to Texas and re-signing Edwin Díaz, Brandon Nimmo, Jeff McNeil and Adam Ottavino to big deals. Díaz already is out for the season following a knee injury during the World Baseball Classic.“$300 million, which is still a lot of money, didn’t get us like it used to,” Cohen said.OLD FACES IN NEW PLACESVerlander left the champion Astros for the Mets after winning his third Cy Young Award.Others on new teams include deGrom (Texas), Trea Turner (Phillies), Xander Bogaerts (Padres), Carlos Rodón (Yankees), Dansby Swanson (Cubs) and Willson Contreras (St. Louis).“The goal is to make 30-plus starts and I truly believe that I will be able to do that,” said deGrom, limited by injuries to 26 starts during the past two years.NEW BOSSESBruce Bochy (Texas), Matt Quatraro (Kansas City), Pedro Grifol (Chicago White Sox) and Skip Schumaker (Miami) are the four new managers among the 30 teams, while interim tags were removed for Rob Thomson (Philadelphia), Phil Nevin (Los Angeles Angels) and John Schneider (Toronto).“You do realize how much you miss it and how much fun so many different parts of the game bring to you,” said the 67-year-old Bochy, who led the San Francisco Giants to three World Series titles and left after 2019, his 25th season as a big league manager.HOT KIDSShortstop Anthony Volpe, just 21, made the Yankees' opening day roster after playing 22 games at Triple-A.

I think it's just a matter of staying loose and trying to hit balls hard and then letting the results play out the way they deem necessary.”The fifth-year senior is second nationally with 16 homers, one behind his former Florida teammate Jac Caglianone.Armstrong had 12 homers in 308 at-bats over four seasons with the Gators. He was among three players sharing playing time at first base and designated hitter by the end of last season.

It was always something I took pride in, trying to see how far I could hit the ball. But translating it into the game took some time.”Armstrong attributes his recent tear to changing his approach at the plate. Instead of waiting for a particular type of pitch, he said, he's looking for one in a certain area of the strike zone. A pitch that's up and middle-inside is what he likes best.“It's really helped me,” he said. “I used to be kind of a guesser up there, just trying to guess pitches. It was more like a 50-50 coin flip whether I was right or wrong. Now I’m sort of becoming a zone hitter.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848489,South Dakota gov's veto of cryptocurrency regulations upheld,"South Dakota's House failed Monday to override Gov. Kristi Noem's recent veto of a bill that would have created government regulations for the use of cryptocurrency in the state.The bill had passed smoothly throughout the legislature, and Noem's veto of last week was upheld on a 37-30 vote.Proponents had argued the bill would have centralized different cryptocurrency systems through one government oversight commission, boosting transparency. But opponents saw the proposed regulations as a tool for potential government surveillance and overreach, saying they wanted more time to see how such legislation fares in other states.Six other states have passed the Uniform Commercial Code's update, which requires tangible records of cryptocurrency exchanges so that they can be considered money. National commercial standards aim to regulate digital currency exchanges by adding transaction records, but Noem said such a step would take away from South Dakotans’ market freedoms.“It would be imprudent to create regulations governing something that does not yet exist. More importantly, South Dakota should not open the door to a potential future overreach by the federal government,” Noem said in a statement last week in vetoing the bill.As similar bills emerge in other state legislatures, Republican counterparts like Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida and U.S. Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota have expressed concerns about possible government surveillance akin to China's heavy-handed oversight of its markets. The suspicions over regulation of a Central Bank Digital Currency come a year after President Joe Biden's executive order to explore a federal bank-owned digital currency. Biden's step triggered a burst of misinformation, including claims it would create a cashless society.Bill proponents argued that those who believe the government would replace cryptocurrency companies with a federal system are mistaken, and that the bill simply would have bridged federal government and digital currencies, which are not currently recognized as money.The bill's sponsor, House Republican Hugh Bartels, said he expects most of the country will pass such code updates amid the rise of various forms of cryptocurrency.“The misconception is that this bill is authorizing central bank digital currency,” Bartels said. “It’s just setting up a way to do business with it.”The first most popular cryptocurrency, bitcoin, launched more than a decade ago. While fundamentally digital money, cryptocurrencies are not backed by any government institution.___This story has been corrected to show the House vote was 37-30, not 36-30.",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848490,Kimberly Palmer: How to use a tax refund to fight inflation,"If inflation has eaten away at your budget the way waves erode a beach, then your tax refund might just provide a much-needed protective barrier.As of March, prices are up 6% over the past 12 months, according to the most recent consumer price index. At the same time, just over half of filers (55%) are expecting tax refunds for the 2022 tax year, with an average expected refund of $2,205, according to the 2023 Nerdwallet Tax Report. Financial experts say consumers can use that windfall — which is really just a delayed paycheck that you already earned — to help offset the strain of those higher prices.“Tax refunds are going to arrive at just the right time for many consumers this spring,” says Drew Wessell, a certified financial planner at Fiduciary Financial Advisors in Grand Rapids, Michigan.UNLOAD HIGH-INTEREST DEBTWith rising interest rates, variable-rate debt becomes more expensive — including credit cards. That’s why many financial experts put paying off debt at the top of the priority list, even considering it a type of investment.“Using your tax refund to pay off a credit card debt with a 20% interest rate gives you an instant, tax-free 20% return on that investment. It’s not a creative idea, but the math makes it the most impactful action that a consumer can take,” Wessell says.SAVE IN A HIGH-YIELD ACCOUNTRising rates also mean rising yields on savings accounts, so you can save your refund and earn more on it. “If you already have a high-yield savings account, you can also look at CDs,” says Marguerita Cheng , a certified financial planner and the founder of Blue Ocean Global Wealth in Gaithersburg, Maryland. CDs, or certificates of deposit, offer higher yields in exchange for less liquidity.Wessell advises saving enough to start or boost an emergency fund, which could help you in the event of a sudden unexpected expense or job loss. “Life is full of surprises, and having an emergency fund helps you avoid going into another debt spiral,” he says.FUND LONG-TERM GOALSBecause higher prices have cut into long-term savings goals like retirement and college, a refund can offer an opportunity to get back on track, Cheng says. “You don’t have to put a lot in, but it can be the seed money,” she adds, noting that her son is using his first refund as he begins his career to open a Roth IRA.Similarly, you could take care of other delayed financial tasks, such as buying life insurance. “Revisit your family situation,” Cheng urges, especially if you have younger children.UPGRADE YOUR HOMEIn many real estate markets, rising home prices along with the higher interest rates make it harder to buy your dream home. Instead, use your refund to improve your current home, suggests Ryan Greiser, a certified financial planner and the founder of the financial firm Opulus in Doylestown, Pennsylvania. New flooring, energy-efficient appliances or improved windows can boost your home’s energy efficiency as well as increase its value.“We love the idea of people loving the space they live in,” Greiser says, especially when they’re priced out of buying a new home.For your outdoor space, invest in a chicken coop and gardening supplies to harvest eggs and vegetables — all of which have become pricier at the grocery store — suggests Tim Melia, a certified financial planner who is the principal and financial planner at Embolden Financial Planning in Seattle. If you have neighbors with skills such as carpentry, you could barter with them for additional savings.CREATE MORE INCOMERemodeling a room in your home to create a rental unit could generate income that helps offset inflation for years, says Melia, who operates a couple of short-term lodging options through vacation rental website Airbnb. He says upfront investments could include better furniture and decor: “You want to be able to stand out.”Similarly, investing in yourself by taking classes for a new skill or certification could increase your income. “It increases your potential to earn and can allow you to step into a more lucrative career or take the next step in your existing career,” Melia adds.FIND SMALL WAYS TO TREAT YOURSELFWhile air travel and other bigger splurges might be prohibitively expensive, your refund can give you more affordable pleasures, even after taking care of other priorities, Cheng says. She indulges in listening to audiobooks (most recently “Spare” by Prince Harry). “I was getting anxiety watching the news at the gym, so instead, I listen to audiobooks,” she says.ADJUST YOUR WITHHOLDINGSLastly, if you’re receiving a refund, it means you overpaid taxes in 2022. You might be better off adjusting your withholdings so you receive more in each paycheck instead. “If you’re getting more than $3,000, then you probably want to revisit your withholdings because that could be $200 to $300 a month,” Cheng says.And that could help offset those higher gas, restaurant or grocery bills all year long.This column was provided to The Associated Press by the personal finance website NerdWallet.

Doncic got the technical that was rescinded in the second of those losses Sunday.The technical came with 7:51 remaining in the third quarter of a 110-104 loss when Doncic argued a no-call after missing a shot on a drive to the basket.Crew chief Kevin Scott said in a pool report after the game that Doncic used “a profanity directed at the officials in protest to a no-call that was correctly judged in postgame video review.”It's the second time Doncic has had a technical foul rescinded this season.After the first loss to the Hornets in Dallas last week, Doncic said he was as frustrated as he's been in his stellar five-year career that has included four trips to the All-Star game.Doncic hinted at off-court issues that were taking the joy out of the game, but wouldn't elaborate beyond saying it was in his private life.The 24-year-old shared those thoughts the same day he was fined $35,000 for making a money gesture toward the refs when he was apparently upset over a non-call on his missed layup in the final seconds.“I think you can see it with me on the court,” Doncic said. “Sometimes I don’t feel it’s me.

(AP) — A Canadian Pacific train derailed in rural North Dakota Sunday night and spilled hazardous materials. But local authorities and the railroad said there is no threat to public safety.There were no injuries and no fire associated with the derailment, which occurred in a rural area outside Wyndmere, a town of several hundred people about 60 miles (97 kilometers) southwest of Fargo.Canadian Pacific spokesperson Andy Cummings said 31 of the 70 cars on the train, including several carrying hazardous materials, left the tracks around 11:15 p.m. Sunday.Four cars filled with liquid asphalt and two railcars filled with ethylene glycol spilled some of those chemicals in the derailment. And Cummings said a car carrying propylene was punctured and released some vapor.It wasn't immediately clear how much of the chemicals were released, but there are no waterways nearby and the chemical spills were contained at the site of the derailment.The railroad's hazardous materials experts are working with local first responders to clean up the spill. Several roads in the area were shut down.Cummings said the railroad believes a broken rail caused the derailment.Railroad safety has been in the spotlight nationally ever since last month's fiery derailment of a Norfolk Southern train near East Palestine, Ohio. Roughly half of that town of about 5,000 people near the Pennsylvania border had to be evacuated after officials decided to release and burn toxic chemicals.Federal regulators and members of Congress have proposed reforms they want railroads to make to prevent future derailments.",2023/03/28,,World

LOUIS (AP) — A federal lawsuit filed Monday by the city of St. Louis accuses automakers Kia and Hyundai of failing to install industry-standard anti-theft technology, resulting in thousands of vehicle thefts in the Missouri city.The lawsuit seeks damages in excess of $75,000 plus punitive damages. St. Louis joins several other cities that have filed similar lawsuits, including Cleveland, Milwaukee, San Diego, Columbus, Ohio, and Seattle.Kias and Hyundais have been targeted since a TikTok social media challenge put a spotlight on the vehicles’ lack of an immobilizer, showing viewers how to hot-wire cars with a USB cord and a screwdriver. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said the thefts have resulted in at least 14 crashes and eight fatalities across the U.S.""Defendants’ careless disregard for the safety of the public has created a public nuisance in the City of St. Louis, resulting in an explosion of auto-related crime that is injuring citizens, taxing St. Louis’s resources, and jeopardizing the public health, safety, and peace of all who live, work, and visit St. Louis,"" the lawsuit states.Kia said in a statement that the lawsuits by St. Louis and other cities are “without merit.”“Kia has been and continues to be willing to work cooperatively with law enforcement agencies in St. Louis to combat car theft and the role social media has played in encouraging it,” the company said.Hyundai Motor America “is committed to ensuring the quality and integrity of our products,” the company said in a statement.St. Louis police have received more than 4,500 reports of thefts of Kia and Hyundai vehicles over the past 10 months, and three-fifths of all vehicle thefts in that span have involved Kias or Hyundais, the city said.The lawsuit cited several incidents involving stolen Kias and Hyundais. In August, occupants of a stolen Kia Optima and a stolen Hyundai Sonata were involved in a shootout near downtown in which a 17-year-old was shot. In September, a bicyclist was struck and killed by a speeding Kia that had been stolen.Last month, both automakers rolled out software updates aimed at stemming the raft of thefts. The updates are free for millions of vehicles that are missing a key anti-theft device. The software updates the theft alarm software logic to extend the length of the alarm sound from 30 seconds to one minute and requires the key to be in the ignition switch to turn the vehicle on.About 3.8 million Hyundais and 4.5 million Kias are eligible for the software update, the NHTSA said.In addition to the software update, Kia said it is shipping more than 27,000 free steering wheel locks to over 140 law enforcement agencies, including nearly 1,500 to police in the St. Louis area, “and we will continue to provide additional free locks as needed.”Hyundai said engine immobilizers became standard on all vehicles in November 2021.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848496,Supreme Court skeptical of man who offered adult adoptions,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court seemed inclined Monday to rule against a man convicted of violating immigration law for offering adult adoptions he falsely claimed would lead to citizenship.Attorneys for Helaman Hansen told the justices during approximately 90 minutes of arguments that the law he was convicted of violating was too broad. But the court's conservative majority in particular seemed willing to side with the government and conclude that it is not.Justice Neil Gorsuch noted that the law “has been on the books for 70 years” without some of the issues Hansen's lawyers worried about. He also expressed no sympathy for Hansen himself, who he said was “taking advantage of very vulnerable people.”“He had every intent in the world to keep these people here to take their money with no prospect they'd ever” actually get citizenship, Gorsuch said.The case involves a section of federal immigration law that says a person such as Hansen who “encourages or induces” a non-citizen to come to or remain in the United States illegally can be punished by up to five years in prison. That’s increased to up to 10 years if the person doing the encouraging is doing so for their own financial gain.The federal government says that from 2012 to 2016 Hansen — who lived in Elk Grove, California, near Sacramento — deceived hundreds of non-citizens into believing that he could guarantee them a path to citizenship through adult adoption.Based on Hansen's promises, officials say, people either came to or stayed in the United States in violation of the law, even though Hansen knew that the adult adoptions he was arranging would not lead to citizenship. The government says at least 471 people paid him between $550 and $10,000 and that in total he collected more than $1.8 million.Hansen was ultimately convicted of encouragement charges as well as fraud charges. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison for the encouragement charges and another 20 years on the fraud charges. But a federal appeals court ruled that the law on encouragement is overbroad and violates the free speech clause of the First Amendment and overturned just those convictions.The court's three liberal justices seemed more concerned about the reach of the law. Justice Elena Kagan asked “what happens to all the cases” where a lawyer, doctor, neighbor, friend or teacher “says to a non-citizen: ‘I really think you should stay.’” Kagan wanted to know whether those people could or would be prosecuted under the law.But Brian Fletcher, arguing for the Biden administration, pointed to the history of the government's use of the law over decades and said those aren't the kinds of cases the government pursues. Kagan seemed to credit that explanation later in the argument.A ruling in the case, United States v. Helaman Hansen, 22-179, is expected by the end of June.",2023/03/28,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848509,New York to pay $5.5M to man exonerated in Sebold rape case,"SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) — A man who spent 16 years in prison after he was wrongfully convicted of raping writer Alice Sebold when she was a Syracuse University student has settled a lawsuit against New York state for $5.5 million, his lawyers said Monday.The settlement comes after Anthony Broadwater's conviction for raping Sebold in 1981 was overturned in 2021. It was signed last week by lawyers for Broadwater and New York Attorney General Letitia James, David Hammond, one of Broadwater's attorneys, said.Broadwater, 62, said in a statement relayed by Hammond, ""I appreciate what Attorney General James has done, and I hope and pray that others in my situation can achieve the same measure of justice. We all suffer from destroyed lives.”“Obviously no amount of money can erase the injustices Mr. Broadwater suffered, but the settlement now officially acknowledges them,” Sebold said in a statement released through a spokesperson.Sebold was an 18-year-old first-year student at Syracuse when she was raped in a park near campus in May 1981. She described the attack and the ensuing prosecution in a memoir, “Lucky,” published in 1999.Sebold went on to win acclaim for her 2002 novel “The Lovely Bones,” which recounts the aftermath of a teenage girl's rape and murder and was made into a movie starring Saoirse Ronan, Susan Sarandon and Stanley Tucci.Sebold, who is white, wrote in ""Lucky” that she spotted a Black man in the street months after being raped and was sure that he was her attacker.“He was smiling as he approached. He recognized me. It was a stroll in the park to him; he had met an acquaintance on the street,” Sebold wrote. “ ‘Hey, girl,’ he said. ‘Don’t I know you from somewhere?’ ”Police arrested Broadwater, who was given the pseudonym Gregory Madison in “Lucky.” But Sebold failed to identify him in a police lineup, picking a different man as her attacker.Broadwater was nonetheless tried and convicted in 1982 after Sebold identified him as her rapist on the witness stand and an expert said microscopic hair analysis had tied Broadwater to the crime. That type of analysis has since been deemed junk science by the U.S. Department of Justice.Broadwater was released from prison in 1999. But he still had to register as a sex offender until his conviction was vacated in November 2021.William J. Fitzpatrick, the current district attorney for Onondaga County, the central New York county that includes Syracuse, joined the motion to vacate the conviction, noting that witness identifications, particularly across racial lines, are often unreliable.Broadwater's settlement with the state must be approved by a judge before it becomes final.“Anthony Broadwater was convicted for a crime he never committed, and was incarcerated despite his innocence. While we cannot undo the wrongs from more than four decades ago, this settlement agreement is a critical step to deliver some semblance of justice to Mr. Broadwater,” James said in an emailed statement.Broadwater has also filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against Onondaga County, the city of Syracuse and an assistant district attorney and a police officer who were involved in prosecuting him. That case is pending.Sebold apologized to Broadwater in a 2021 statement released to The Associated Press and later posted on Medium.She wrote that “as a traumatized 18-year-old rape victim, I chose to put my faith in the American legal system. My goal in 1982 was justice — not to perpetuate injustice. And certainly not to forever, and irreparably, alter a young man’s life by the very crime that had altered mine.”",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848510,Cavs complete long climb back to NBA playoffs without LeBron,"CLEVELAND (AP) — Five years felt like 50.When the Cleveland Cavaliers beat Houston 108-91 on Sunday night to clinch their first playoff spot since 2018, it ended a modest postseason drought for a franchise and its fans, who had grown spoiled by winning and challenging for NBA championships.Blame LeBron James for that.The superstar led Cleveland to four straight Finals, delivering the city its first pro sports title since 1964 in 2016. But since James left as a free agent five years ago — for the second time — his immense shadow had engulfed, if not overwhelmed, the Cavs.They finally emerged from it.After just missing the playoffs a year ago, the Cavs reached one of their goals and have a few others on their to-do list.“They're not satisfied with just this,” said coach J.B. Bickerstaff, who has been instrumental in the team's post-LeBron rebuild. ""We ain't done yet.”Currently just two games behind Philadelphia for the No. 3 seed in the Eastern Conference, Cleveland is healthy, playing its best ball in weeks and peaking as the regular season eases into its final days.Taking advantage of a soft section in their schedule, the Cavs, who were knocked out in the play-in tournament a year ago, have won 9 of 11 and are on track for their first 50-win season without James on the roster since 1992-93.The road back to relevance wasn't smooth.James' departure in the summer of 2018 was followed by several notable failures, including coach Tyronn Lue's firing six games into the 2019 season and the flawed decision to hire former Michigan coach John Beilein, who only made it to the All-Star break in 2020.There were a pair of 19-win seasons, excursions into the NBA lottery, major injuries, team in-fighting, roster teardowns and general malfunction.""The first year I got traded here, it was rough,” recalled center Jarrett Allen, whose arrival from Brooklyn as part of the three-team James Harden trade in 2021 accelerated the turnaround. “While it was still fun, a lot of things weren’t going our way at the time. Not playing for anything at the end of the year, looking forward to the summer, I think we all went through that.""The next year, we lost in the play-in game and now we’re finally here. It was a journey.”Along the way, Koby Altman, the team's president of basketball operations, has made astute moves to restructure a roster left in virtual ruin following James' departure. The Cavs now have one of the league's strongest and most promising young cores.Altman jump started the process in 2019 by first drafting Darius Garland, who has blossomed into an elite guard at age 23. Isaac Okoro came a year later and is the team's best on-ball defender.Forward Evan Mobley came aboard last year, and the 21-year-old not only pairs with Allen to give Cleveland a formidable frontline — it leads the league in defensive rating — but his growth on offense makes the Cavs tough to guard.Nothing, though, has changed them more than Donovan Mitchell.When Altman swooped in and landed Mitchell, who was thought to be headed to the New York Knicks, in a blockbuster trade with Utah in September, Cleveland sent a clear message that it's home remodeling was finished.One of the game's most prolific scorers, Mitchell has blended in seamlessly, almost effortlessly. Not only has the supremely confident 26-year-old raised the Cavs' win total, but the team's expectations and outlook are soaring at levels not seen since James was wearing Cleveland's wine and gold colors.Following Sunday's win, Mitchell reminded his teammates there was more to do.“We have a bigger goal at stake. Not just making the playoffs, not just winning a first round, second round, third round,” he said. ""Making it all the way. It’s going to be tough. There’s going to be guys or teams that have a lot of experience and have been there, but I think we’re up for that challenge.“We have that hunger. You see it with this group and on a night-to-night basis. It’s continuing to prepare and continue to play all the way until June.”After pulling away from the Rockets to wrap up their 30th win inside noisy Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse, the Cavs barely celebrated on the floor before retreating to their locker room. To them, it was just another win, routine, expected.But it meant so much more. It was the first time Cleveland had made the playoffs without James on the roster in 25 years.“Since 1998?” Mitchell asked incredulously while looking at the scroll on the bottom of the TV. “I had no idea.”It had only felt like forever.___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848511,DeSantis signs bill expanding school voucher program,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Monday signed legislation to allow all K-12 students in the state to get taxpayer-funded vouchers for private schools, continuing a focus on education as he prepares to launch an expected Republican presidential campaign.The law expands Florida's voucher system by eliminating income eligibility limits on the program. Democrats and critics have said the legislation has an unclear price tag, amounts to a subsidy for the wealthy and could harm public schools.The so-called school choice movement first gained traction in the U.S. in the 1990s but has seen a renewed push after coronavirus pandemic school closures and ongoing cultural debates over education around gender and race.DeSantis has made eliminating what he describes as liberal ideology in education a focal point of his conservative agenda, harnessing unease among some Republicans regarding what they view as inappropriate subjects being taught in schools.“There will be a preference for low and middle income families but at the end of the day we fundamentally believe that the money should follow the student and it should be directed based on what the parent thinks is the most appropriate education program for their child,” DeSantis said at a bill signing ceremony at a Catholic school in Miami.The bill was a priority of Republican House Speaker Paul Renner and it was expedited through the GOP-dominated state Legislature. On Monday, Renner said the new law will allow parents to send children to alternative schools where their values and faith are respected, referencing “some of the craziness that happens in our K-12 schools.”Florida began its voucher program to help parents pay for private schools more than two decades ago under Republican Gov. Jeb Bush and has passed several laws to expand it over the next three Republican administrations. DeSantis two years ago signed a bill raising income levels to receive vouchers to 375% of the federal poverty level. DeSantis on Monday said 1.3 million children in Florida attend a school chosen by parents.About a dozen other states have or are considering so-called school choice bills this year. A handful of states make vouchers available to all students, regardless of family income levels.Andrew Spar, president of the Florida Education Association teachers union, said the law will divert public money to private schools.It ""will drain billions of taxpayer dollars away from the neighborhood public schools that nearly 90 percent of Florida’s parents trust to educate their children,"" he said in a statement. “Additionally, this new law will hand over that public money to unaccountable, corporate-run private schools.”Democrats have repeatedly raised questions about the program's potential cost.A House analysis of the bill estimated it could cost more than $209 million, but a Senate analysis put the potential figure at more than $646 million. The independent Florida Policy Institute calculated that the program may cost $4 billion.House Democratic Leader Fentrice Driskell on Monday said “cost and accountability are grave concerns.”“I am personally concerned, and I think many in our caucus share this sentiment, that this could be devastating to Florida’s public schools,"" she said.",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848512,UN Security Council won't probe Nord Stream blasts,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The U.N. Security Council on Monday declined a Russian request to investigate the blasts on the pipelines that move natural gas from Russia to Europe under the Baltic Sea.Russia, China and Brazil voted in favor of the Russian request, but other Security Council members abstained or said another investigation was unnecessary.For a resolution to be adopted by the U.N. Security Council, it needs a minimum of nine “yes” votes in the 15-member council, and no veto by one of the permanent members — the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France.The U.S. deputy ambassador, Robert Wood, said there was no need for a U.N. probe when investigations by Sweden, Denmark and Germany “are proceeding in a comprehensive, transparent and impartial manner.”“It was an attempt to discredit the work of ongoing national investigations and prejudice any conclusions they reached that do not comport to Russia’s predetermined and political narrative. It was not an attempt to seek the truth,” he said.The pipelines, known as Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2, are majority-owned by Russia’s state-run energy giant Gazprom.Nord Stream 1 carried Russian gas to Germany until Moscow cut off supplies at the end of August 2022. Nord Stream 2 never entered service as Germany suspended its certification process shortly before Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. The explosions on both occurred on Sept. 26.The investigations by European nations have yet to yield conclusive results, at least none made public.Both pipelines bypass existing routes that go through Ukraine, meaning that Ukraine could lose income from transit fees and be unable to directly use the gas they carry. The Nord Stream pipelines were seen as an effort by Russia to gain further control over Europe’s energy supplies.Some have said the blasts caused the worst release of methane in history.The New York Times, The Washington Post and German media have published stories citing U.S. and other officials as saying there was evidence Ukraine, or at least Ukrainians, may have been responsible. The Ukrainian government has denied involvement.Russian President Vladimir Putin has dismissed as “sheer nonsense” allegations that Ukrainians could have been behind the blasts and pointed the finger at the U.S.",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848513,NJ takes over Paterson police after crisis worker's shooting,"New Jersey's attorney general said Monday that his office has taken control of the police department in the state's third-largest city, Paterson, less than a month after officers there fatally shot a well-known crisis intervention worker during a tense standoff.Attorney General Matt Platkin said at a news conference that his office had assumed control of all police functions without delay, including the division that investigates internal police matters. His announcement didn't mention the shooting of 31-year-old Najee Seabrooks directly, but it reflected activists' concerns about how the department was being run.“There is a crisis of confidence in law enforcement in this city,” he said to brief cheers and calls of “Thank you” from the audience. “Something has to change, and it will change starting now. Earlier this morning, I exercised my authority as attorney general and superseded the Paterson Police Department.”Platkin said the takeover amounted to a “pledge” to residents and officers that the state is committed to safety in the city.During a phone interview later Monday, Platkin said it wasn't a single case that led to his office's takeover of the Paterson Police Department.“This is not a step I take lightly. It’s something I’ve been considering for a while. It’s been a series of misconduct ... a complete breakdown of trust,” he said.Isa Abbassi, a 25-year veteran of the New York Police Department currently serving as the chief of strategic initiatives there, will take charge of Paterson's police department in May, Platkin said. He said his office “quietly conducted a nationwide search” and settled on Abbassi.In the meantime, a New Jersey State Police officer will serve as the department's interim head.Pat Colligan, president of the New Jersey State Policemen’s Benevolent Association, which is the union that represents Paterson's police officers, said in a statement that the “vast majority of those officers are doing an extraordinary job under very difficult, trying circumstances.”Besides the takeover, Platkin said he’s implementing some other changes. They include a program that pairs a police officer with a mental health screener in an unmarked vehicle to respond to 911 calls about mental or behavioral health issues.He also said the state will revamp its protocols statewide for dealing with people who have barricaded themselves in a room or building — as Seabrooks had done for more than five hours before he was killed. Platkin also formed a “working group” to study and make recommendations on interactions between police officers and violence intervention officers.The standoff started about 8 a.m. on March 3 when police were called to Seabrooks’ brother’s apartment where he had been holed up in the bathroom. Seabrooks, who was a crisis intervention worker and mentor with the nonprofit Paterson Healing Collective, had called 911 at least seven times and told dispatchers that people were threatening him and he needed immediate help.Police arrived soon after and talked to him through the door, offering to get him water and calling him “love” in one instance. But the tension increased when he told police he was armed with a “pocket rocket” gun and a knife.Police shot Seabrooks when he emerged from the bathroom with a knife, according to the attorney general’s office.His death shook his co-workers, who were at the scene and texting with him, said Liza Chowdhury, Seabrooks’ boss at the Paterson Healing Collective. She said Seabrooks had been texting with colleagues, asking to see them, but that police blocked the co-workers from entering the apartment.Chowdhury said Monday that she appreciated Platkin’s decision, but she also called on him to fire the officers involved in the shooting.In the weeks since his death, anti-violence advocates organized a vigil calling for a number of reforms, including the creation of a civilian review board. The New Jersey Institute for Social Justice has called on the Justice Department to investigate the city’s police department, and the ACLU of New Jersey said the shooting shows the need to invest in non-law enforcement responses to mental health calls.It isn't clear how long the takeover will last. Platkin said he's “in for the long haul.”Platkin didn’t specify what behavior led to the takeover, but his office has been involved in a handful of investigations in the city of more than 150,000 that's roughly 20 miles (32 kilometers) northwest of New York.In February, Platkin announced an aggravated assault charge against a Paterson officer who he said shot a fleeing unarmed man. In December, a grand jury declined to indict Paterson police officers involved in the death of a man they restrained two months earlier.The U.S. Department of Justice has the power to sue police departments where there has been an established pattern of illegal behavior, corruption or unconstitutional policing practices, and issue legally binding consent decrees to require changes in those practices. It recently issued a report that will lead to a consent decree in Louisville, Kentucky, and it put the police department in New Jersey's biggest city, Newark, under federal supervision.State actions against local departments are less common because of local control is often stipulated in state constitutions.Paterson's police department is the largest to be taken over by the state in recent years, but it isn't the only one. Among the others are the 11-officer department in Lavallette, as well as three others in Union County.___Associated Press writer Claudia Lauer contributed to this article.",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848514,Column: COTA yet another sloppy NASCAR road course race,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — Kimi Raikkonen couldn’t get over how many restarts there were in the waning laps of NASCAR’s first road course race of the season. Jordan Taylor called his NASCAR debut “a race of survival” and Jenson Button found much of it “a bit silly.”That was the verdict from three of the most experienced road racers in the world after a mess of a NASCAR race that took three overtimes to be decided. Tyler Reddick finally won it Sunday when the race at Circuit of the Americas went seven laps past the scheduled distance to reach a conclusion.Raikkonen, who scored his final Formula One victory on the Texas road course in 2018, found himself fourth on one of the many late restarts with a view of the lead out his front windshield. That didn't last long; he was gobbled up, run off course and shuffled back to a 29th-place finish.“It looked like you’d be very good, then three corners later, somebody’s going the wrong direction,” the former F1 world champion said. “It’s such a shame how it went in the end, but I think we did the right thing. We were there. But then on the restart it’s how it was.”Button, the 2009 F1 world champion who has two more NASCAR races scheduled this season and is part of NASCAR's lineup in a modified stock car for the 24 Hours of Le Mans, was the highest-finishing road course ringer at 18th. It was an eye-opening experience for the British driver based on the length of the race — the overtimes sent it past its scheduled distance of 68 laps for a run time of 3 hours, 30 minutes — and the physical nature of NASCAR drivers using stock cars to slam into one another.Button said he experienced heat exhaustion during a race he found 60% enjoyable but “40% of it kind of felt a bit silly, the amount that we were hitting each other.”“In Turn 1 I would turn in and get whacked ... and on the exit I got a big whack back,” Button said. “The revenge is enjoyable, but there’s points where it feels that we could do better. I mean the action’s amazing, don’t get me wrong, The first 10 laps, it just destroyed me. Every time I was in a corner I had someone overtaking me.”And then there was Taylor, a four-time IMSA sports car champion and class winner at the 24 Hours of Le Mans who was driving Chase Elliott's car for Hendrick Motorsports. His Chevrolet should have been a contender, but Taylor, who is accustomed to driving in fields full of cars with various speed capabilities and vastly different talent levels, found the entire event “definitely wild.”“I wouldn’t say I survived. I feel like I’m beat up. Every restart, you just get smashed in the front, rear, side,” Taylor said after finishing 24th. ""It was pretty much just survival. The guys knew I’d be a little bit more hesitant, so they would take advantage of it.“I’d say it was a disappointing day. We had good pace, but we just got shuffled back every restart. Tough day.And that's what NASCAR road course racing has become, especially with the durable Next Gen car that can withstand considerable bumping and banging and typically still finish a race. Veteran Cup drivers have been lambasting declining on-track etiquette, which was evident Sunday on nearly every restart as dozens of cars would launch into the first turn with little regard to who or what they hit.Reddick said it's a combination of the strength of the car and aggressive drivers angling for every position possible on track.“The way that things kind of have progressed, the front and rear bumpers of this car are really resilient. You can really hit someone pretty hard without knocking the nose of your car out. The rear bumpers are really tough, too,"" Reddick said. “You look at Turn 1 here, Turn 1 at Indy road course, they’re very inviting corners with a lot of room. It’s just a product of restarts and the nature of NASCAR racing and how aggressive all the drivers are. Someone’s going to be on the short end.""It made for an exhausting end of the race with 10 cautions over the final 15 laps — enough for exasperated spectators calling for a mercy rule. Because there are only six road courses on NASCAR's 38-race schedule — including the inaugural street course race scheduled for downtown Chicago in July — the current crop of drivers don't have the road racing experience to produce a quality show.The same thing happened in February at the preseason exhibition race inside Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, where drivers struggled for a long stretch to complete more than a handful of laps under green on the temporary short track. While NASCAR wants diverse tracks on its schedule, a lack of practice and testing has made it difficult for many in the field to find a comfort level on the unfamiliar circuits.That makes for sloppy racing for a series that touts itself as the best in the United States. If NASCAR truly wants to diversify its product, it needs to give teams on-track time to acclimate to the new style of racing.And while the three overtimes may have felt excessive, the winner wouldn't have wanted the race to end any other way.“We’d be robbing the fans of a finish. That’s what they deserve,” Reddick said. “They deserve a good finish to the end. They deserve to see us make it back to the white flag. I think the rule the way it is is the way it should be. The fans pay a lot of good money to come out here, watch a good race, a good finish. Deserve to put that product out there for the fans.”___AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848515,Minnesota suit against e-cigarette maker Juul goes to trial,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison is slated to lead off opening statements expected for Tuesday in his state's lawsuit against Juul Labs – marking the first time any of the thousands of cases against the e-cigarette maker over its alleged marketing to young people is going to play out in a courtroom.Minnesota sued Juul in 2019, accusing the San Francisco-based company of unlawfully targeting young people with its products to get a new generation addicted to nicotine. Ellison has declined to put a dollar figure on how much money the state is seeking in damages and civil penalties. But he said when he announced the lawsuit that it could be in the ballpark with Minnesota's landmark $7.1 billion settlement with the tobacco industry in 1998.Juul has faced thousands of lawsuits nationwide but most have settled, including 39 with other states and U.S. territories. Minnesota added tobacco industry giant Altria, which formerly owned a minority stake in Juul, as a co-defendant in 2020. Altria completed its divestiture this month and says it effectively lost its $12.8 billion investment. A few days later, Altria announced a $2.75 billion investment in rival electronic cigarette startup NJOY.“We will prove how Juul and Altria deceived and hooked a generation of Minnesota youth on their products, causing both great harm to the public and great expense to the State to remediate that harm,” Ellison said in a statement.The jury trial, before Hennepin County District Judge Laurie Miller, is expected to last about three weeks. That contrasts with nearly four months for the landmark 1998 lawsuit by the state and Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota against the big tobacco companies.That case forced the release of millions of pages of previously secret industry documents and ended in a $7.1 billion settlement just before the state was due to deliver its closing arguments. Part of the money went to fund anti-smoking programs, but both Juul and Altria have pointed out in court filings that lawmakers opted to spend much of the money simply to fund state government.Ellison plans to deliver part of the state's opening statement himself before handing it off to attorneys from two outside law firms that are handling the case for Minnesota. The lawsuit alleges consumer fraud, creating a public nuisance, unjust enrichment and conspiracy. A brief filed last week gave a preview of the state's arguments.“Defendant JUUL, in a conspiracy joined by Altria, preyed upon and enticed Minnesota’s children, through deceptive and illegal tactics, to buy a product that may sentence them to a lifetime of nicotine addiction and other destructive behaviors,"" attorneys for the state wrote. ""JUUL embarked on a design and marketing campaign that would ensnare children, focusing on attracting ‘cool kids,’ creating a nicotine ‘buzz,’ and using social media and celebrities to act as ‘pushers’ of its addictive products. Defendants claim their conduct was in the name of helping ‘aging smokers’ to stop smoking. That claim is false; it is a smoke screen.”Juul said in a statement that Minnesota had rejected settlement offers similar to those it reached with other states, which provided “hundreds of millions of dollars to further combat underage use and develop cessation programs in those states.""""Effective interventions to address underage use of all tobacco products in Minnesota, including vapor, depends not on headline-driven trials, but on evidence-based policies, programs, and enforcement,"" the statement continued. “This is the approach that Juul Labs supports and has been part of implementing.”Altria Group — the maker of Marlboro cigarettes and other tobacco products formerly known as Phillip Morris Cos. — is minimizing its role. It said in a court filing last week that it bought a 35% stake in Juul Labs in 2018 after its own vaping products failed to gain traction, and only after Juul assured Altria “and announced to the world,” that it had made “meaningful changes” to its marketing practices.Richmond, Virginia-based Altria said the services it provided to Juul — supplying strategic counter space in stores and distributing a Juul ad and coupons to adult smokers — lasted just over a year and ended in March 2020 And it maintains that its support did not appreciably increase sales of Juul products in Minnesota nor the use of e-cigarettes by minors in the state.Juul, which launched in 2015, became the U.S. vaping market leader on the popularity of flavors like mango, mint and creme brulee. Its rise was fueled by its use among teenagers, some of whom became hooked on Juul’s high-nicotine pods. Amid the backlash, Juul dropped all U.S. advertising and discontinued most of its flavors in 2019. Juul has since lost popularity with teens, and its share of the multibillion-dollar market has fallen to about 33% from a high of 75%.In June, the Food and Drug Administration rejected Juul’s application to keep its products on the market as a smoking alternative for adults, though that decision is on appeal. In September, Juul agreed to pay nearly $440 million to settle a two-year investigation by 33 states into its marketing of high-nicotine products.States with litigation still pending against Juul include New York, California, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Alaska, Illinois and West Virginia, plus the District of Columbia.",2023/03/28,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848517,"Wisconsin school bans Miley, Dolly duet from class concert","MADISON, Wis. (AP) — Administrators at a Wisconsin elementary school stopped a first-grade class from performing a Miley Cyrus and Dolly Parton duet promoting LGBTQ acceptance because the song ""could be perceived as controversial.""Students at Heyer Elementary School in Waukesha had prepared a rendition of “Rainbowland"" for their spring concert, but school officials struck the song from the lineup last week. Parents in the district say the decision was made because the song encourages LGBTQ acceptance and references rainbows.Superintendent James Sebert, who did not immediately return a call on Monday, confirmed to Fox6 that administrators had removed “Rainbowland” from the first-grade concert because it might not be “appropriate for the age and maturity level of the students."" He also cited a school board policy against raising controversial issues in classrooms.Sebert has previously prohibited rainbows and pride flags from being displayed in Waukesha classrooms and suspended the school district’s equity and diversity work in 2021.“Let's all dig down deep inside, brush the judgment and fear aside,” the song from Cyrus' 2017 album “Younger Now” goes. ""Living in a Rainbowland, where you and I go hand in hand. Oh, I’d be lying if I said this was fine, all the hurt and the hate going on here.”First-grade teacher Melissa Tempel said she chose the song because its message seemed universal and sweet. The class concert's theme was “The World” and included other songs such as “Here Comes the Sun,"" by The Beatles and “What a Wonderful World,” by Louis Armstrong.""My students were just devastated. They really liked this song and we had already begun singing it,” Tempel said Monday.Administrators also initially banned the song “Rainbow Connection” from The Muppets but later reversed that decision, according to Tempel.Parents have been angered by the song's removal, Tempel said. But she was more concerned about what the ban and other district policies against expressing LGBTQ support meant for students.“These confusing messages about rainbows are ultimately creating a culture that seems unsafe towards queer people,” she said.Spokespersons for Parton and Cyrus did not immediately respond to emails on Monday asking the artists' thoughts on the ban.Wisconsin school boards races, including in Waukesha, have become increasingly partisan in recent years. Republicans saw big gains across the state's school board races in 2022 and have used the positions to challenge policies from rules about transgender kids to COVID-19 restrictions.___Harm Venhuizen is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

His first, against Argentina in the 2018 World Cup, was voted goal of the tournament.France made it back-to-back wins to open Group B but this was far from the easy ride that the Netherlands gave Les Bleus in a 4-0 thrashing on Friday. That night, Mbappé scored twice in his first match as France captain but the striker was barely a factor against a resolute Ireland team which defended stoutly early on before piling on the pressure near the end at the Aviva Stadium.It needed Maignan to produce two stunning stops at corners — first off his own teammate, Jules Kounde, and then from a header from Ireland defender Nathan Collins that was heading into the top corner — to preserve the win.“It was a tough game. Ireland are always difficult to play here,"" France manager Didier Deschamps said. “They were dangerous at the end, especially from set-pieces. We have a young team, but they have quality and character, too.”France brought Olivier Giroud back into the lineup and the striker, at 36 years, 178 days, became the oldest outfield player in the history of the national team to start.Giroud was also quiet, though was involved in the highlight of a low-key first half when his header at a corner took a double deflection before Ireland goalkeeper Gavin Bazuna flopped on the ball at Mbappé’s feet.It fell to Pavard to produce the magic.“The World Cup didn’t go the way I would have imagined,” the defender said. “But I was happy after every win, I was there for the collective.”It was Ireland's opening game of group play.“We’re disappointed and frustrated, but that’s why they’re such a good team,"" Ireland captain Seamus Coleman said of France. “We didn’t allow them a lot of chances.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848522,New source of water found in moon samples from China mission,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — Scientists have discovered a new and renewable source of water on the moon for future explorers in lunar samples from a Chinese mission.Water was embedded in tiny glass beads in the lunar dirt where meteorite impacts occur. These shiny, multicolored glass beads were in samples returned from the moon by China in 2020.The beads range in size from the width of one hair to several hairs; the water content was just a miniscule fraction of that, said Hejiu Hui of Nanjing University, who took part in the study.Since there are billions if not trillions of these impact beads, that could amount to substantial amounts of water, but mining it would be tough, according to the team.“Yes, it will require lots and lots of glass beads,” Hui said in an email. “On the other hand, there are lots and lots of beads on the moon.""These beads could continually yield water thanks to the constant bombardment by hydrogen in the solar wind. The findings, published Monday in the journal Nature Geoscience, are based on 32 glass beads randomly selected from lunar dirt returned from the Chang'e 5 moon mission.More samples will be studied, Hui said.These impact beads are everywhere, the result of the cooling of melted material ejected by incoming space rocks. Water could be extracted by heating the beads, possibly by future robotic missions. More studies are needed to determine whether this would be feasible and, if so, whether the water would be safe to drink.This shows “water can be recharged on the moon’s surface ... a new water reservoir on the moon,” Hui said.Previous studies found water in glass beads formed by lunar volcanic activity, based on samples returned by the Apollo moonwalkers more than a half-century ago. These, too, could provide water not only for use by future crews, but for rocket fuel.NASA aims to put astronauts back on the lunar surface by the end of 2025.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848523,Judge: District attorney can't be co-counsel in Baldwin case,"SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) — A New Mexico judge said Santa Fe's district attorney shouldn't serve as co-counsel in the manslaughter case against actor Alec Baldwin and a weapons supervisor in the fatal shooting of a cinematographer during a 2021 movie rehearsal. Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer on Monday said the district attorney should either lead the case on her own or turn it over entirely to another prosecutor.Baldwin and movie armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed have pleaded not guilty to charges of involuntary manslaughter in the shooting death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. The charges carry a maximum penalty of 18-months in prison and fines.Hutchins died shortly after being wounded Oct. 21, 2021, during rehearsals at a ranch on the outskirts of Santa Fe. Baldwin was pointing a pistol at Hutchins when the gun went off, killing her and wounding the director, Joel Souza, on the set of the Western movie “Rust.”District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies is regrouping after the resignation of special prosecutor Andrea Reeb in the wake of missteps in the filing of initial charges against Baldwin and objections that Reeb's role as a state legislator created conflicting responsibilities.Carmack-Altwies has been preparing to appoint a new special prosecutor and also guide the complex case as co-counsel. But a defense attorney for Gutierrez-Reed objected to the arrangement, arguing it would be illegal under New Mexico law and fundamentally unfair to a 25-year-old defendant with limited financial resources.Marlowe Sommer, the judge, said Monday during a court hearing by videoconference that the district attorney had misread key provisions of state law in assembling a team to prosecute the case.“Basically, what I’m ruling, Ms. Carmack-Altwies, is that you are going to use (the law) in the way I’ve interpreted it, which means that you may not co-counsel, or you stay the course and not use a special prosecutor and prosecute it on your own,” Marlowe Sommer said.Baldwin's attorneys did not intervene in Monday's arguments. A weekslong preliminary hearing in May will decide whether evidence against Baldwin and Gutierrez-Reed is sufficient to proceed to trial.Carmack-Altwies said her agency is contending with a shortage of staff attorneys and that a new special prosecutor will need her help in getting up to speed on the case quickly. The district attorney also said her continued involvement as co-counsel would provide an extra measure of accountability as an an elected prosecutor to political constituents.Defense Attorney Jason Bowles said the district attorney was unfairly exceeding her authority.“We are representing Hannah Gutierrez-Reed — she is a 25-year-old female who does not have all of those resources and does not have a war chest,” Bowles said. “And the state is essentially saying we get to put all this money together, a special taxpayer appropriation, to go after not only Mr. Baldwin, but also Hannah Gutierrez-Reed. That’s not what the statute was designed to do.”",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848524,Texas names Terry as full-time coach after Elite Eight run,"AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Texas on Monday named Rodney Terry as full-time head basketball coach, removing the interim tag after he led the Longhorns to the Elite Eight following the midseason firing of Chris Beard.The school tweeted the news of Terry's appointment and scheduled a Tuesday news conference to introduce him as head coach going forward.The announcement came barely 24 hours after the Longhorns' season ended when Texas was knocked out of the NCAA Tournament by Miami on Sunday. Financial terms and years of the agreement were not immediately available.Rewarding Terry with the promotion was no surprise.He took over the Longhorns as acting head coach when Beard was first suspended on Dec. 12 after a felony domestic violence arrest. Terry was then given the title of interim head coach when Beard was fired Jan. 5. The charge against Beard was dismissed in February.Texas won the Big 12 Tournament championship under Terry and questions about his future with the program were amplified as the Longhorns kept winning in the postseason. Texas fans wondered what more he needed to prove and Longhorns players publicly advocated for him to get the job.“It was all about this team. I’ve enjoyed every single day of this journey with this group,” Terry said in Sunday’s postgame news conference as his voice cracked and he held back tears. “It was never about me. It was always about these guys. I love these guys.”Texas athletic director Chris Del Conte had praised Terry’s job handling the team in crisis and gave him a raise, though only through April. He’d also noted Terry inherited a veteran, senior-heavy roster and strong staff of assistants built by Beard.That lineup could have disintegrated into chaos after Beard’s arrest. Instead, the Longhorns finished second in the Big 12 in the regular season and earned a No. 2-seed in the NCAA Tournament.Texas went 22-8 under Terry, and he march to the Elite Eight was the program's first time beyond the NCAA Tournament’s first weekend in 15 years.Terry is the second Black head coach in program history, joining Shaka Smart, who coached Texas from 2015-2021.Terry, 54, had a previous stint as an assistant at Texas under Rick Barnes from 2002-2011. He also was head coach at Fresno State and UTEP. He left UTEP after three seasons to join Beard’s staff in 2022. He is 185-164 as a head coach.Former Texas player T.J. Ford, who led the Longhorns to 2003 Final Four and was that season's Naismith national player of the year, praised the move to keep Terry.“I’m very excited that the right decision was made to continue this great culture,” Ford tweeted.The dormant Texas program had all the signs of renewal under Beard, as he mined the transfer portal to build a roster to compete in the rugged Big 12. He had done the same at Texas Tech, where he led the Red Raiders to the 2019 national championship game.Beard was arrested after his fiancée called 911 and told police he choked, bit and hit her during a confrontation at his home. She later recanted that she was choked, but Texas still fired Beard as university lawyers called him “unfit” to lead the program.The Travis County district attorney eventually dismissed the felony charge, saying the charge could not proved beyond a reasonable doubt, and because of the fiancee's wish to not prosecute.Beard has since been hired at Mississippi.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/28,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848527,Chipotle agrees to pay after closing store that sought union,"PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — Chipotle Mexican Grill has agreed to pay $240,000 to former employees as part of a settlement stemming from a complaint that the company violated federal law by closing a restaurant where workers wanted to unionize.Chipotle announced it was permanently closing its Augusta, Maine, location last year after workers filed a National Labor Relations Board petition for a union election. The NLRB later said the closure was illegal.The Maine location was the first in the chain to file a union petition. The settlement, released by union officials on Monday, states that two dozen employees will receive payments from Chipotle and they will be placed on a preferential hiring list for other Maine locations.The company must also post a notice in dozens of stores in New England that it won't close stores or discriminate against employees due to union support, the settlement states.""It sends a message to corporations that shutting down a store and blackballing workers didn’t work for Chipotle and it won’t work for them either,” said Brandi McNease, a former employee of the Augusta store and the lead organizer of the union drive, in a statement provided by the Maine AFL-CIO.Chipotle said in a statement that it settled the lawsuit because fighting it would have been burdensome and expensive. The company respects “our employees’ rights to organize under the National Labor Relations Act"" and is ""committed to ensuring a fair and just work environment that provides opportunities to all,” said Laurie Schalow, chief corporate affairs officer for the company, in a statement.“We settled this case not because we did anything wrong, but because the time, energy and cost to litigate would have far outweighed the settlement agreement,” Schalow said.The Augusta location closed last summer. Workers described the closure as retaliation for the union drive, but company representatives said the closure wasn't related to unionization.The payments the workers are receiving vary based on their average number of hours worked, pay rate and longevity prior to store closing, union officials said.There are currently 10 other open unfair labor practice cases against Chipotle, said Kayla Blado, a spokesperson with the National Labor Relations Board's Office of Congressional and Public Affairs. Parties agreed in January to a settlement on four of these, Blado said.",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848528,"Police: Blood, video link doctor to lawyer's disappearance","Investigators have blood, video and other evidence linking a Tampa-area plastic surgeon to the disappearance and presumed death of a lawyer who was representing former colleagues the doctor is suing, prosecutors said in court documents filed Monday.The lawyer's body has yet to be found, but prosecutors have charged Dr. Tomasz Kosowski with first-degree murder. He has pleaded not guilty.Security video shows someone driving Kosowski's pickup truck last Tuesday morning outside the law firm where Steven Cozzi worked. The person went inside wearing a backpack and gloves and carrying a large box, prosecutors said.Almost two hours later, it appears the same man exits Blanchard Law wearing different clothes, pulling a large cart containing something in a bag or covered by a blanket. He struggled with its weight as he pulled it near the truck, prosecutors said. The man then stops.At about this time, Kosowski, 44, dialed into a telephone conference about his lawsuit. Cozzi had been expected on the call, but missed it. As soon as it ended a half hour later, the person in the surveillance video begins loading the cart into the doctor's truck, again struggling with its weight, prosecutors said.Blanchard Law has been representing Kosowski’s former employer and co-workers in an ongoing lawsuit he filed against them four years ago. Kosowski, who began working for Laufer Institute of Plastic Surgery in 2016 doing breast reconstructions, says in the lawsuit that the woman Laufer assigned to process his insurance billing didn’t file claims and lied to his patients, costing him tens of thousands of dollars and resulting in negative reviews online.The day Cozzi disappeared, a colleague looking for him discovered his wallet, keys and phone in his office and a large amount of blood in the building’s public bathroom.About a half an hour after the truck left the law firm, a license plate reader near the doctor's home showed it arriving in the neighborhood and got a shot of what appears to be a body covered by a bag or blanket in the truck bed, prosecutors said.The license plate reader detected the truck leaving the neighborhood about five hours later. It was next seen by a license plate reader in Miami, a 300-mile (480-kilometer) trip that likely would have gone through the Everglades.Police executed a search warrant at Kosowski's home Thursday and found blood both in the bed of his pickup bed and its cabin, as well as in the garage, prosecutors said. They stopped the doctor Saturday in another vehicle and found a ballistic vest with a substantial amount of blood on it and a bag containing brass knuckles, a stun gun, syringes containing a paralyzing agent and other sedatives, duct tape and masks.Kosowski, who goes by “Dr. K,” was arrested shortly after and charged with first-degree murder. He is being held without bond at the Pinellas County jail. His attorney, Bjorn Brunvand, said Monday that he has filed a not guilty plea on Kosowski's behalf and requested a jury trial.“That's all I can really say at this point,” Brunvand said in an email.In his lawsuit against the Laufer Institute, Kosowsky alleges his ""promising young career has essentially been obliterated” by the employee who was supposed to be filing his insurance claims. “Through no fault of his own, his career was put directly in jeopardy and his reputation has been deeply tarnished.”Kosowski left the Laufer Institute in 2018 and set up his own practice.Telephone and email messages seeking comment were left with Blanchard Law and the Laufer Institute.Cozzi's mother, Lois Cozzi, issued a statement to Tampa media over the weekend saying, “As a family, we are frantic with worry and numb with fear over Steven’s disappearance.""",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848529,"Mbappé's France, Vlahović's Serbia heading toward Euro 2024","GENEVA (AP) — Kylian Mbappé is captaining France to a comfortable start in qualifying for the European Championship though Serbia's Dušan Vlahović was the standout striker on Monday.France's 1-0 win at Ireland was earned by defender Benjamin Pavard's rasping 50th-minute shot that was a rare show of attacking force in Dublin.Like France, Serbia has begun its qualifying program with two wins thanks to Vlahović striking twice late in a 2-0 win at Montenegro. The first in the 78th was a slick first-time shot to meet a cross from the left flank.Poland got its first points after beating Albania 1-0 though it was a Major League Soccer striker rather than superstar Robert Lewandowski who scored.Karol Świderski, who plays for Charlotte and was little used at the World Cup, got the decisive goal just before halftime.A look at the eight qualifying games across Europe on Monday:GROUP BFor the second time in four days, France players were hugging goalkeeper Mike Maignan at the final whistle for their new No. 1’s standout saves.Maignan’s leaping, stretching save to push away a goal-bound header by Ireland defender Nathan Collins ensured a 1-0 win in Dublin. On Friday, in a 4-0 rout of the Netherlands, Maignan kept his shutout by saving a stoppage-time penalty from Memphis Depay.Depay opened the scoring on Monday for the Dutch with a 24th-minute header in a routine 3-0 win over minnow Gibraltar.It seemed like an attack vs. defense practise even before Gibraltar’s Liam Walker was sent off in the 51st for a high tackle on midfielder Mats Wieffer.One minute earlier, Nathan Ake scored with a header and the defender added his second in the 82nd when his deflected shot from the edge of the penalty area rolled softly into the net.GROUP GDušan Vlahović was not fully fit at the World Cup and Serbia went home early without a win and last in a group in which Brazil and Switzerland advanced.The Juventus forward was sharp on Monday, scoring with a pair of left foot shots late in a 2-0 win at Montenegro.Serbia and Montenegro, which both began the five-team group with wins on Friday, are neighbors who formed a united team for three years from 2003, including at the 2006 World Cup.Hungary captain Dominik Szoboszlai scored perhaps the goal of the night in a 3-0 win over Bulgaria.Szoboszlai fired in a fast, dipping free kick from 25 yards (meters) into the top right corner of the Bulgaria goal. That lifted Hungary to a two-goal lead after just 26 minutes of its first game in qualifying and it was 3-0 by halftime.Bulgaria’s second straight loss already looks likely to extend its wait to play at a finals tournament beyond 20 years.GROUP FBelgium had a night off in the five-team group and plays Euro 2024 host Germany in a friendly on Tuesday.That let Austria go clear in the standings, adding a 2-1 win over Estonia to another home win on Friday against Azerbaijan.Austria trailed for much of the game to Estonia’s 25th-minute opener, and led only in the 88th on Michael Gregoritsch’s deflected shot from near the penalty spot.Coach Ralf Rangnick was punching the air in jubilation in his technical area, and next takes his team to play favored Belgium on June 17.Sweden got back on track after its 3-0 beating at home to the Belgians on Friday, easing past Azerbaijan 5-0.Sweden managed without Zlatan Ibrahimović, because of an unspecified injury for the 41-year-old forward, and eased some of the pressure that was building on coach Janne Andersson.GROUP EPoland coach Fernando Santos got his first points in his new job since leaving Euro 2016 champion Portugal after the World Cup in December.A modest 1-0 win over Albania was earned by Świderski’s strike in the 41st, when he reacted fastest at the edge of the six-yard box to collect a rebound from a shot that struck a post.Czechia leads the five-team group with four points, though a 0-0 draw at Moldova was a drop in class from its 3-1 home win over Poland on Friday. ___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848530,San Diego State shutting down foes with disruptive defense,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — Brian Dutcher lays out San Diego State’s mission in plain talk to avoid any confusion.“We’re a defensive-first team,” the sixth-year coach said after the Aztecs muscled past Creighton 57-56 on Sunday and into their first Final Four. “Everybody knows that about us, and our defense carries us.”The challenge for Florida Atlantic, UConn or Miami this weekend in Houston is solving the disruptive mix of quick hands and physicality the experienced Aztecs have used to wear down opponents.Only New Mexico, Nevada and Boise State have cracked that defensive code since the year started, the last setback coming nearly a month ago. Fifth-seeded San Diego State (31-6) is 14-1 since Feb. 3 and it has ratcheted up the resistance in March Madness triumphs against overall top seed Alabama, No. 12 College of Charleston and No. 13 Furman.All three teams shot just 32% against a rotation of veterans and transfers who have bought into Dutcher’s philosophy. Alabama committed 14 turnovers, had eight shots blocked and was held 18 points below its season average in the 71-64 Sweet 16 loss.Sixth-seeded Creighton shot 40% in the South Region final, but just 28% while missing all 10 long-range attempts during a pivotal second half. The Bluejays finished 2 of 17 from deep, and San Diego State opponents have made 16 of 94 attempts (17%) in the tournament.The Mountain West Conference’s first Final Four participant, the Aztecs will face FAU on Saturday.San Diego State had to wait a few minutes before it could celebrate its win over Creighton. Officials needed the time to review a last-second court-length inbounds pass by Creighton that was deflected out of bounds. Aztecs forward Aguek Arop jumped for the ball with Creighton’s Arthur Kaluma, a fitting example of a team that embraces physical play.“They play a brand of basketball that’s built on toughness, built on intelligence,” Creighton coach Greg McDermott said. “They don’t take many bad shots, and they’re very physical when the ball goes up in the glass.”Alabama coach Nate Oats said after Friday night's loss that San Diego State’s physicality bothered his team and got them off their drives. He added, “They’re a tough, physical, big, strong experienced team, and especially in the first half we didn’t come out prepared.”San Diego State is also patient, owing to its maturity.Seven seniors are among nine upperclassmen that include four transfers. While offense matters, Dutcher stresses says playing defense creates opportunities at the other end.The numbers demonstrate that everyone’s good with that.The Aztecs rank 35th nationally in field goal defense at 41% and are tied for 70th with 4.0 blocks per game. Creighton was their 16th opponent held below 60 points, nearly 10 below its average coming in.“We make sure any time we play against a team there’s five guys all on one guy,” 6-foot-10 senior forward Nathan Mensah said. “We don’t take that for granted, and we know our defense will always play out as the game goes.”That faith in defense has been key in overcoming second-half deficits against Alabama and Creighton.San Diego State’s halftime lead became a nine-point hole against the Crimson Tide before it scored 12 straight points to take the lead for good with 8:43 remaining. The Aztecs rallied from a 43-37 deficit against Creighton and never trailed again despite five ties over the final 6:23.One of the happiest San Diego State players after the game was leading scorer Matt Bradley, who was held to eight points over the weekend after averaging 12.8 coming in. While he was off, he saw the Aztecs get big stops and timely contributions from Arop and Mensah.“We’ve got seven, eight dudes that could just get a bucket for us, get a big stop and just make a game-winning play,” Bradley said. “That’s a testament to what this team has personnel-wise.”Combine that depth with the defense, and San Diego State is in a place it could only dream about before the season.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/28,,World

(AP) — A rescued juvenile dolphin that was airlifted from Texas to the Florida Keys about one year ago is thriving and interacting with other dolphins at a Keys-based marine mammal facility, officials said Monday.The orphaned male calf dubbed Ranger was discovered in June 2021. He was stranded near Goose Island State Park and suffering from a respiratory infection and dehydration. Rescued near his dead mother, the young bottlenose dolphin was deemed too young to forage and survive in the wild.The National Marine Fisheries Service chose the Dolphin Research Center in Grassy Key, Florida, as Ranger’s permanent home after he was temporarily cared for at the Texas State Aquarium in Corpus Christi.“Dolphins are very social; they live in a family, they depend on that family even to learn how to catch fish,” said Linda Erb, the Dolphin Research Center’s vice president of animal care and training. “Without a mom, without a family, this little guy would have starved — he would not have known how to be a wild dolphin.”Erb said her team’s primary goal has been to make sure that Ranger, now about 3 years old, learned to socialize with other dolphins in a natural lagoon at the center after his release from a necessary five-week quarantine in a medical pool.“The Ranger that was living in our med pool is a different dolphin than the Ranger living out here now today,” Erb said. “He is fully adapted into the family and has surrogate moms that help take care of him.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848534,Arizona governor: scheduled execution is unlikely next week,"PHOENIX (AP) — A vow by Arizona's governor not to proceed with any executions amid lingering questions about the rights of death row prisoners appears to have paused a scheduled execution next week, even though it hasn't officially been called off.Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs won a key battle recently when the Arizona Supreme Court concluded a state law didn't require her to proceed with the planned April 6 execution of Aaron Gunches, even though his execution date wasn't canceled.Hobbs has vowed no prisoners will be executed until there’s confidence that the state isn’t violating constitutional rights when enforcing the death penalty.Gunches was scheduled to receive a lethal injection for the 2002 killing of Ted Price, who was his girlfriend's ex-husband. He had pleaded guilty to a murder charge in the shooting death near Mesa, Arizona.Price’s sister, Karen Price, had tried unsuccessfully to get the court to order Hobbs to carry out the execution. Price then asked for a stay of execution. In making that seemingly contradictory move, Karen Price’s attorney expressed concern that the state was going let the court order authorizing Gunches’ execution expire before factual issues in Karen Price’s litigation could be resolved.The governor’s office said Monday that it isn’t expecting the execution to be carried out next week. “As we explained in our prior statements and legal filings, the state does not expect to be in a position to carry out an execution by April 6,” the governor's office said in a statement. Hobbs had previously appointed a retired federal magistrate judge to examine Arizona's procurement of lethal injection drugs and other death penalty protocols due to the state’s history of mismanaging executions.Colleen Clase, an attorney for Karen Price, didn’t immediately return a call seeking comment Monday.“The governor has made very clear the state is not prepared to go forward with the scheduled execution,” said Dale Baich, a former federal public defender who teaches death penalty law at Arizona State University. “I would expect that it would not take place (next week).” Lawyers for Hobbs have said the state lacks staff with expertise to carry out an execution, was unable to find an IV team to carry out the lethal injection and doesn’t- currently have a contract for a pharmacist to compound the pentobarbital needed for an execution. They also said a top corrections leadership position that’s critical to planning executions remains unfilled. Some requirements for carrying out executions under the state’s death penalty protocol have not been met in Gunches’ case.The corrections department said the warrant of execution issued by the state Supreme Court wasn’t read to Gunches. And Gunches wasn’t moved to a special “death watch” cell where he would be monitored around the clock and remain until his execution.In a statement Monday, the agency said that its death penalty protocols “have been paused as we conduct our systemic review of the execution process and complete the necessary steps to demonstrate efficacy and competency in the established protocols.”Arizona, which currently has 110 prisoners on death row, carried out three executions last year. That followed a nearly eight-year hiatus brought on by criticism that a 2014 execution was botched and because of difficulties obtaining execution drugs. Since then, the state has been criticized for taking too long to insert an IV for lethal injection into a condemned prisoner’s body and for denying the Arizona Republic permission to witness the three executions.Gunches, who is not a lawyer, represented himself in November when he asked the Supreme Court to issue his execution warrant so that — he said — justice could be served and the victim’s families could get closure. In his last month in office, Republican Attorney General Mark Brnovich asked the court for a warrant to execute Gunches.But Gunches then withdrew his request in early January, and newly elected Democratic Attorney General Kris Mayes later asked for the warrant to be withdrawn.The state Supreme Court rejected Mayes’ request, saying that it must grant an execution warrant if certain appellate proceedings have concluded and that those requirements were met in Gunches’ case.Gunches switched courses again, saying now that he wants to be executed and asked to be transferred to Texas, where, he wrote, “inmates can still get their sentences carried out.” Arizona’s high court denied the transfer.",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848535,N. Carolina governor signs Medicaid expansion bill into law,"RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper on Monday signed a Medicaid expansion law that was a decade in the making and gives the Democrat a legacy-setting victory, although one significant hurdle remains before coverage can be implemented, thanks to a Republican-backed provision.At an Executive Mansion ceremony attended by hundreds, Cooper celebrated passage of expansion legislation, which he's ardently sought since being first elected governor in 2016. It took Republicans in charge of the General Assembly all this time to come around to the idea and agree to offer coverage to more low-income adults, with federal coffers paying for most of it.North Carolina has been among 11 states who haven’t accepted expansion from the federal government. States with Republican leaders have recently been considering expansion after years of opposition.“This law, once implemented, will be the working families bill of the decade,” Cooper said. “Today is a historic step toward a healthier North Carolina.”The measure contains a proviso that Cooper opposed requiring a separate state budget law to be enacted first for expansion to be accepted and implemented. That makes an enrollment start date unclear and gives the GOP leverage in upcoming negotiations.Still, Monday's new law should mean government-funded health coverage to potentially 600,000 adults who earn too much to qualify for traditional Medicaid but too little to received heavily subsidized private insurance. Also coming will be billions of dollars annually from Washington into the state. North Carolina currently has 2.95 million Medicaid enrollees, but Cooper said many others suffer in a health care coverage gap, having to ignore treatable and preventative illnesses.“While a solution sat just out of reach, with this law I’m about to sign, many of them will be close enough to grab it,” Cooper said, standing next to House Speaker Tim Moore, Senate leader Phil Berger and other expansion supporters.The two legislators earlier this month finalized a negotiated agreement that contains expansion and looser “certificate of need” regulations on health care facilities before they can open more beds or use expensive equipment. The House and Senate approved the deal separately, with the final vote happening Thursday.Republicans in charge of the legislature had for years knocked down the expansion idea that originated from the 2010 Affordable Care Act. That led to litigation against Cooper and budget impasses between them.But GOP leaders reversed themselves in recent times, convinced that the state’s Medicaid program was fiscally sound with a switch to managed care, and that Congress would neither repeal the 2010 law nor raise the state's 10% required share of expenses.“Now we have a Medicaid system that is stable,” Berger said. “By transforming our state’s Medicaid program, we’re now in a place where our system can handle those additional enrollees.” Republicans also were attracted to an additional two-year $1.75 billion payout for North Carolina from the federal government if it expanded Medicaid.A persistent coalition of expansion proponents — with the governor and his Cabinet leading the charge — had helped build pressure toward a deal.“I’m thankful for Gov. Cooper, who has pushed the need for health care since the beginning and didn’t stop until this was completed,” said Cassandra Brooks, who owns day cares near Raleigh and advocated for expansion after two of her teachers lacking insurance died prematurely.The expansion fight between Cooper and the legislature began during his first week as governor in 2017. Cooper tried to get President Barack Obama's administration to approve his expansion request before Donald Trump took office. Moore and Berger successfully sued to block the efforts, citing in part a 2013 state law preventing expansion without express General Assembly approval.In 2019, Cooper’s demand that expansion be negotiated contributed to a state budget deadlock with GOP legislators that never got fully resolved.The 2021 budget law contained language to convene a legislative blue-ribbon commission that looked at expansion and other ways to improve health care access. The Senate and House approved competing expansion measures in 2022, but negotiations stalled. They resumed this winter.Requiring the budget's passage for expansion provisions to be enacted means Republicans could fill the budget bill with unrelated items that Cooper opposes. Republicans are now just one House lawmaker shy of holding veto-proof control at the General Assembly.“I feel confident that we can work together to get something that we can agree on,” Cooper told reporters after the signing, adding that expanding Medicaid if now a question of “when” and not “if.”Monday's legislation directs the state's expansion expenses be paid with hospital assessments. Hospitals also will get money for treating Medicaid expansion patients, and the law will enter them into a federal program for larger reimbursements.",2023/03/28,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848549,Tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus: What does this mean?,"Russian President Vladimir Putin's nuclear threats gained momentum over the weekend when he announced that he had struck a deal with Belarus' President Alexander Lukashenko to station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus.This is the first time since the mid-1990s that Moscow will base arms outside the country. In the televised statement on Saturday, Putin also said that Russia will have completed the construction of a storage facility for these weapons in Belarus by July, although he did not specify when the transfer of weapons would take place.Concerns over growing nuclear tensions between Russia and the US have been reemerging as Russia recently suspended participation in the US-Russian New START agreement on nuclear arms reduction. Shorthand for ""Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty,"" the deal caps the number of strategic nuclear weapons each country may have, but does not specify numbers for smaller tactical nuclear weapons.While there are no confirmations on how many tactical nuclear weapons Russia currently has, according to a Reuters report, the United States believes Russia has around 2,000 such working tactical warheads, which is approximately 10 times more than Washington.In response, the US has said that there have been no indications that Russia was preparing to use nuclear weapons, but that they would continue to monitor the situation.""We have not seen any reason to adjust our own strategic nuclear posture, nor any indications Russia is preparing to use a nuclear weapon,"" the US State Department said, adding that ""we remain committed to the collective defense of the NATO alliance.""Bruno Lete, senior fellow for security and defense at the German Marshall Fund of the United States, told DW that Putin's announcement comes as no surprise to Europe and NATO.""First of all, this is part of a  larger trend in the past year where Russia has stepped up its nuclear rhetoric, and NATO and Europe are prepared,"" he said.""But after Russia suspended the new 'Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty,' worries persist that Russia could deploy nuclear weapons without any verification systems. This isn't great for peace and security and it would be better if this treaty was still in place,"" he added.Tactical nuclear weapons are used for specific targets in the battlefield and can replace conventional warheads in common weapon systems. They cannot detonate by themselves, but require a delivery system like Iskander missiles — short-range ballistic missile systems which Russia has used to launch conventional warheads in Ukraine and Syria.""Tactical nuclear weapons are launched purely for winning a battle, and are not designed to attack a city. They're smaller warheads and can be up to 100 kilotons depending on the target,"" William Alberque, Director of Strategy, Technology and Arms Control at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) told DW.By comparison, strategic nuclear weapons are inter-continental and have the capacity to destroy an entire city.""These weapons can be fired or delivered from, let's say for example, Russian territory to hit US territory. So back in the Cold War, for a warhead to be considered strategic, they would say that it should have the capacity to be launched from Siberia to Montana. They're more than 100 kilotons, or at least five times the size of the Hiroshima-Nagasaki bombs, and can cause a lot of damage,"" Alberque said.The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)limits the spread of nuclear weapons to non-nuclear powers. In his Saturday statement, Putin argued that stationing tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus was not in breach of this this agreement.""There is nothing unusual here either: The United States has been doing this for decades. They have long placed their tactical nuclear weapons on the territory of their allies,"" Putin said according to Russia's state-owned TASS news agency.Under the NPT, the United States, Russia, China, France, and Great Britain have the right to nuclear weapons. While they cannot transfer nuclear weapons or technology to a non-nuclear power, they can deploy weapons outside their borders. Putin has highlighted that Russia would retain control over the weapons deployed, in line with non-proliferation agreements.The US has currently deployed nuclear weapons to Europe in countries like Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, and Italy.Stefan Scheller, an associate fellow in the German Council on Foreign Relations’ Security and Defense Program highlighted that the US deploying a number of nuclear weapons to some locations in Europe was part of NATO's collective defense strategy.""There is a NATO concept called 'nuclear sharing.' This is a longstanding policy of nuclear deterrence that ensures that the benefits, responsibilities, and risks of nuclear deterrence are shared across the alliance. It aims to guarantee the security of its allies,"" he said.Alberque shared a similar view and said that the tactical weapons the US owns are purely designed to target troop formations or critical military infrastructure points like military headquarters of command-and-control centers. ""They're not designed as strategic weapons designed to hit Moscow or St. Petersburg or something like that,"" he said.With respect to Putin using Belarus as a launchpad for tactical nuclear weapons, Scheller highlighted that the decision was unilaterally announced by Putin, and not during a press conference with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko.""This is a clear sign that Belarus is losing more and more national sovereignty,"" he said.Over the past years, Lukashenko has bolstered ties with Putin, helping him maintain a stronghold in Minsk amid widespread protests calling for his resignation. In 2022, he also held a referendum after which a new constitution ditching the country's non-nuclear status was approved.According to Lete, Russia deploying tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus means it could launched a strike on NATO territory far more quickly than before.""So the response time for NATO to act will be [shorter],"" he said. ""So, NATO either continues nuclear deterrence, which the alliance is already doing, or NATO can engage in nuclear coercion, where it engages with Russia to discourage it from deploying weapons to Belarus. But under the current situation, I think NATO will continue nuclear deterrence,"" he added.Edited by Maren Sass",2023/03/27,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848550,Why is the US sending 'downgraded' weaponry to Ukraine?,"Whether Leopard 2 battle tanks from Norway, or MiG-29 fighter jets from Slovakia, Ukraine receives pledges for the delivery of heavy weapons from its international allies almost daily. On March 20, the United States announced a new military aid package worth $350 million (€325 million). But the M1 Abrams main battle tanks previously promised were not included.US officials said they were seeking to shorten delivery times and they would deliver older models by fall. In January, Politico reported that, because of export regulations, the United States intended to strip the Abrams tanks of their classified armor package, which includes depleted uranium, before sending them to Ukraine.Gustav Gressel, a senior policy fellow who specializes in armed conflict and military affairs at the European Council on Foreign Relations, told DW that this is nothing unusual. ""Ukraine is receiving the export variant of the Abrams, the same ones that are used in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Iraq,” Gressel said. He added that the armor is comparable to that of the older German Leopard 2A4 tanks that Norway and, earlier, Poland had delivered to Ukraine. Gressel said the older Abrams was ""still a good battle tank: It has a good thermal imaging camera and a powerful cannon, and is superior to Russian tanks in terms of handling.”Export regulations are one of the reasons why the United States is only delivering certain weapons to Ukraine in modified editions. But that is not the only reason. ""In Ukraine, they are asking themselves what would happen if a tank would be left behind and would be captured and analyzed by the Russians,” Gressel said. This concern also extends to the M777 howitzers that the US has been delivering to Ukraine since April 2022. These howitzers were handed over without GPS navigation and associated onboard computers. Weapons without GPS are generally less accurate.Ukraine's army quickly found a solution and installed its own systems, including GIS Arta military software developed in Ukraine to coordinate artillery strikes. In May, media reported that Ukraine had deployed M777 howitzers using GIS Arta software to stop the advance of a particularly large number of Russian troops crossing the Siverskyi Donets river near the village Bilohorivka in the Luhansk region. ""With artillery, firing orders go much faster digitally,"" Gressel said. For Russia, he added, ""much is still being done with radiotelephony.""Serhiy Hrabsky, a former officer in Ukraine's armed forces, told DW that he is not concerned by the limitations of weapons systems sent by Ukraine's allies. ""All guidance information systems are integrated into NATO command structures,"" Hrabsky said. They can only be used in the framework of NATO tasks."" He said this was common practice and Ukraine used its own systems.The situation is different with US-made High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) launchers, which Ukraine has successfully been using since summer for precision strikes deep behind the front line. The United States has been supplying missiles with a range of about 80 kilometers (50 miles), but not the far-more-powerful Army Tactical Missile System missiles, which can hit targets up to 300 kilometers away.The Wall Street Journal reported that the United States modified these rocket launchers prior to delivery so that missiles with a longer range could not be fired — even if Ukraine could procure them on the global market. The paper cited an anonymous source from the US government as saying the decision was made to reduce the risk of escalating the standoff between the United States and Russia. In September, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said long-range missiles would be a ""red line"" that would make the United States a party to the conflict. Gressel said the technical limitations could be reversed on the HIMARS launchers should the United States choose to do so.Stephen Blank, a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute who specializes in Russia and a former professor at the US Army War College's Strategic Studies Institute, said the limitations on weapon systems had to do with a ""fear of Russia and an escalation of the war by Russia."" However, Blank said he considered such concerns exaggerated. ""I think we are too afraid of a escalation by Russia,"" Blank said. ""I don't understand why Russian territory should be excluded from Ukrainian strikes. Russia started this war and has destroyed Ukraine."" On the battle field, Blank said he saw a ""significant difference"" in the fact that Russia could concentrate its military equipment on the border with Ukraine and ""fire at will"" without fearing a counterattack. ""If they could not do that anymore,"" Blank said, ""that would be a great advantage for Ukraine."" Blank advocates for demonstrating that Ukraine ""won't be pushed around.""At them beginning of 2023, international allies promised Ukraine missiles with a range of 150 kilometers. At the time, Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov said Ukraine would pledge not to fire them into Russia. But that did not go for areas occupied by Russia.Blank said Ukraine's allies within Europe were more worried than US officials are. He said the administration of US President Joe Biden sought to preserve NATO unity and was therefore taking such concerns into account. The alliance has repeatedly emphasized that it is not a party to the war and will not be drawn into it. Gressel also does not think that NATO should engage directly, but he criticizes the apparent notion in the United States that the war could be ""micromanaged in a way that it ends in a desired stalemate."" He said that war is ""too complex and too chaotic to be micromanaged.""""This just signals to Putin that he has a certain chance of winning the war by sitting it out,"" Gressel said. ""Any restraint in Western weapon deliveries is a signal to him that we are not serious.""This article was originally written in German.",2023/03/25,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848551,Xapo Bank Becomes The First Fully Licensed Bank To Enable USDC Deposits and Withdrawals,"Xapo Banks marks a watershed moment for digital asset innovation by enabling members to bypass costly and time-consuming SWIFT payments and deposit and withdraw via USDC instead.
BANGKOK, THAILAND -  Media OutReach - 28 March 2023 -  Xapo Bank, a leading Bitcoin custodian and licensed private bank, has collaborated with  Circle, a global financial technology company helping money move at internet speed, to become the first licensed bank in the world to integrate USDC payment rails as an alternative to SWIFT.            USDC is a digital dollar, also known as a stablecoin, that provides a faster and more efficient way to send and receive money around the globe, 24/7, including weekends, in under an hour. By adding outrails to its existing USDC onramps, Xapo Bank enables members to bypass costly and time-consuming SWIFT payments and instead deposit and withdraw with no fees charged by Xapo Bank.   The bank is offering a 1:1 conversion rate from USDC to USD. All USDC deposits at Xapo Bank are automatically converted to USD, meaning members can benefit from a 4.1% annual interest rate return on deposits.   A fully licensed and regulated bank, Xapo Bank is a member of the Gibraltar Deposit Guarantee Scheme (GDGS) and guarantees its members’ USD deposits up to *$100,000 USD equivalent. Ensuring member protection, Xapo Bank does not stake any crypto deposits or have any exposure to surrounding crypto markets as all deposits are automatically converted to USD held by the bank.   Unlike traditional banks, Xapo Bank does not lend and therefore does not rely on fractional reserve banking to make money as its core business model. Instead, Xapo Bank has all its customers' funds in reserve and invests in short-term liquid assets to pass the interest earned to its customers.   Seamus Rocca, CEO of Xapo Bank, said:  “Xapo Bank’s USDC payment rails mark a watershed moment in financial history, combining the speed and cost efficiency of the digital dollar with the security guarantees of a licensed private bank. Enabling auto-converted USDC deposits and withdrawals at Xapo Bank gives crypto members a safe haven for their savings. Running 24/7, including weekends, we eliminate the anxiety of keeping your money in exchanges and the hassle of expensive offramps into traditional banks.”   “Xapo Bank was built to protect members’ savings. Unlike many traditional banks, we do not offer customer loans; all of our customers' money is held dollar for dollar on our balance sheet. It is invested in very short-dated, highly credit-rated money market instruments and short-term bonds. We pass that benefit to our members through a 4.1% interest rate, paid daily.”   “We charge our members an honest membership fee of $150 USD that helps us recover our overheads and means we don’t have to rely on paying almost no interest to our members or use hidden fees to make money. We give the benefit of more than 80% of the yield we generate back to our members.”    Xapo Bank is constantly striving to grow its payment rails options, offering members additional currency choices managed with the security of a fully-regulated bank. The USDC news comes after last week’s announcement that Xapo Bank had integrated with the  Faster Payment System (FPS) to activate support for GBP settlement for account deposits and withdrawals. Earlier this month, the bank also announced an integration with Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, in collaboration with Lightspark.   *Xapo offers 4.1% interest on US dollar deposits, which are protected by the GDGS up to €100,000 EUR (i.e. circa $106,673 at current exchange rates).

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848552,Family of US couple kidnapped in Haiti pleads for release,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — Nikese Toussaint was at church, so she didn’t see the text message from her sister.All she knew at that point was that their brother and his wife, who live in the U.S., had landed safely in Haiti to visit ailing relatives and prepare for Rara, a colorful and boisterous festival born out of the dark days of slavery.It wasn’t until Toussaint got home and her sister followed up the unread text with a phone call that she learned her warnings had materialized: their brother, an accountant; his wife, a social worker; and another person were snatched off a public bus amid a surge in gang-related kidnappings.Toussaint took a deep breath. Not again, she thought.Seventeen years earlier, gangs had kidnapped two of her cousins in the capital of Port-au-Prince. They were eventually released but remain traumatized.This time, the gang that kidnapped her brother, wife and another person is demanding $200,000 — each.“How are we ever going to come up with that money?” Toussaint told The Associated Press in a phone interview Monday from the U.S.The kidnapping occurred March 18, and since then, her brother, Jean-Dickens Toussaint, has been allowed to make only two brief calls.All his family knows is that he and his wife, Abigail Michael Toussaint, are tied up. The phone calls are too brief to find out if they are being given food or water or treated generally well, Nikese Toussaint said.The couple were on their way to Jean-Dickens Toussaint’s hometown of Leogane, which many Haitians believe organizes the country’s best Rara festival. Three pandemic years had gone by since he last led a Rara band through those streets, and the 33-year-old accountant was excited to resume his role as “colonel.”Rara is similar to a carnival, with drums, bamboo instruments and metal horns accompanying singers as they parade through the town behind band leaders like Toussaint in an homage to the slave revolution that led Haiti to become the world’s first Black republic.But the celebration was cut short.The Toussaints, who are from Tamarac, Florida, never made it to Leogane.Gangs stopped the public bus they were on as it tried to cross Martissant, considered ground zero for ongoing violence that has worsened since the July 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moïse.The gangs apparently noticed the suitcases in the bus and zeroed in on the couple and the person accompanying them on the trip, Nikese Toussaint said.The family paid someone they trusted $6,000 to give to the gang, but the money vanished. It's not unusual for gangs in Haiti to refuse to release kidnapping victims even after they've been paid, but Toussaint believes it was a scam.“That’s when we said, ‘Uh, oh, we have to get help,’” she recalled. “We didn’t know what to do at that point. We don’t want to take any more risks.”Toussaint said her family is in touch with the FBI, which is helping with the case.“To the gangs, I want to say, we want our family back. We are not rich over here,” Nikese Toussaint said.A statement from the U.S. State Department said the agency was aware of reports of two U.S. citizens being kidnapped and was in regular contact with Haitian authorities.The kidnappings are the latest to target U.S. citizens, although most victims are Haitian, ranging from wealthy business owners to humble street vendors. At least 101 kidnappings were reported in the first two weeks of March alone, with another 208 people killed in gang clashes during that period, according to the U.N.The ongoing violence in Port-au-Prince and beyond also has displaced at least 160,000 people as warring gangs set fire to neighborhoods in their bid to control more territory.More than a week has gone by since the Toussaints were kidnapped. Their family is trying to stay strong because the couple have a son who turns 2 on Tuesday.“We’re trying to smile,” Nikese Toussaint said of their video calls with the boy. “We have to smile with him, and give him love, and at the same time we get a little smile (from him), and that’s when the pain gets a little harder.”",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848553,California lawmakers OK potential fines for high gas prices,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California lawmakers on Monday approved the nation's first penalty for price gouging at the pump, voting to give regulators the power to punish oil companies for profiting from the type of gas price spikes that plagued the nation's most populous state last summer.The Democrats in charge of the state Legislature worked quickly to pass the bill on Monday, just one week after it was introduced. It was an unusually fast process for a controversial issue, especially one opposed by the powerful oil industry that has spent millions of dollars to stop it.Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom used his political muscle to pass the bill, which grew out of his call last October for a special legislative session to pass a new tax on oil company profits after the average price of gas in California hit a record high of $6.44 per gallon, according to AAA. Taking on the oil industry has been a major policy priority for Newsom, who is widely viewed as a future presidential candidate.“When you take on big oil, they usually roll you -- that’s exactly what they’ve been doing to consumers for years and years and years,” Newsom told reporters after the vote. “The Legislature had the courage, conviction and the backbone to stand up to big oil.”He is expected to sign the bill into law Tuesday.Legislative leaders rejected his initial call for a new tax because they feared it could discourage supply and lead to higher prices.Instead, Newsom and lawmakers agreed to let the California Energy Commission decide whether to penalize oil companies for price gouging. But the crux of the bill isn't a potential penalty. Instead, it's the reams of new information oil companies would be required to disclose to state regulators about their pricing.The companies would report this information, most of it to be kept confidential, to a new state agency empowered to monitor and investigate the petroleum market and subpoena oil company executives. The commission will rely on the work of this agency, plus a panel of experts, to decide whether to impose a penalty on oil company profits and how much that penalty should be.“If we force folks to turn over this information, I actually don't believe we'll ever need a penalty because the fact that they have to tell us what’s going on will stop them from gouging our consumers,"" said Assemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan, a Democrat from Orinda.California's gas prices are always higher than the rest of the country because of the state's taxes and regulations. California has the second-highest gas tax in the country at 54 cents per gallon. And it requires a special blend of gasoline that is better for the environment but more expensive to produce.But state regulators say those taxes and fees aren't enough to explain last summer, when the average cost of a gallon of gasoline in California was more than $2.60 higher than the national average.“There's truly no other explanation for these historically high prices other than greed,” said Assemblymember Pilar Schiavo, a Democrat from Chatsworth. “The problem is we don't have the information that we need to prove this, and we don't have the ability to penalize the kind of historic price gouging we saw last year.”The oil industry recorded massive profits last year, following years of huge losses during the pandemic when more people stayed home and fewer people were on the road.Eloy Garcia, lobbyist for the Western States Petroleum Association, said California's high gas prices are the result of decades of public policy decisions that have made the state an island in the global petroleum market and driven many oil refiners out of the state. He noted California does not have a pipeline to send oil into the state, meaning it has to ship what it can't produce itself from the ocean, which takes longer and costs more.“We're not like Texas. We're not like Louisiana. We're not like the Northeast,” Garcia said. “We do not have a fungible fuel supply. We have chosen to do that. We have set ourself up by 30 years of public policy.”Garcia said Monday's vote “sends a clear signal not to invest in California.”Lauren Sanchez, senior climate advisor for Gov. Gavin Newsom, said the state has plenty of supply, noting California oil refineries exported 12% of their product to other states last year.“We're also the third-largest gasoline market in the world for these companies,” she said.",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848554,"State, defense request another stay of execution for Glossip","OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — Oklahoma's top prosecutor and attorneys for death row inmate Richard Glossip both asked a court on Monday to once again delay Glossip's upcoming execution while his attorneys seek to have his conviction overturned.Attorney General Gentner Drummond and one of Glossip's attorneys, Warren Gotcher, filed a joint motion for a stay of execution with the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals. They ask that the execution, currently set for May 18, be delayed until at least August 2024 so that the court can consider a separate motion from Glossip's attorneys for an evidentiary hearing they suggest could prove his innocence.Shortly after Drummond took office in January, he made available to Glossip's defense team a box of material that Drummond's predecessor, John O'Connor, had not permitted them to view. O'Connor had designated the materials, consisting largely of prosecutor's notes in the case, as “work product,” according to the filing.Glossip's defense attorneys maintain that evidence included in those notes point to his innocence and have asked the court for an evidentiary hearing and to reverse his conviction and sentence.“Had these items from Box 8 been disclosed before trial as the state was constitutionally obligated to do, there is a reasonable probability that the result of the trial would have been different,” Glossip's attorneys argue in their application for post-conviction relief.Messages seeking comment from Glossip's attorneys were not immediately returned Monday.Drummond's office has not taken a position on Glossip's application for relief, but agreed to the motion for a stay of execution. Drummond has also ordered an independent inquiry into Glossip's case that has not yet been completed.Among the evidence Glossip's attorneys say should have been turned over to his defense are notes related to the mental health and drug use of Justin Sneed, who admitted robbing and killing motel owner Barry Van Treese, but claims he did so only after Glossip agreed to pay him $10,000. Sneed, who received a sentence of life in prison, was a key witness in the case against Glossip.Glossip's attorneys suggest other details from witness statements that conflicted with the state's evidence also was never disclosed to them.Glossip, now 60, has long maintained his innocence in the 1997 murder-for-hire killing. His case attracted international attention after actress Susan Sarandon — who won an Academy Award for her portrayal of death penalty opponent Sister Helen Prejean’s fight to save a man on Louisiana’s death row in the 1995 movie “Dead Man Walking” — took up his cause in real life. Prejean herself has served as Glossip’s spiritual adviser and frequently visited him in prison.An independent investigation conducted last year by Houston law firm Reed Smith raised new questions about Glossip's guilt. The firm’s report did not find any definitive proof of Glossip’s innocence, but raised concerns about lost or destroyed evidence and a detective asking leading questions to Sneed to implicate Glossip in the slaying.Glossip has been scheduled to be executed three separate times, only to be spared shortly before the sentence was set to be carried out. He was just hours from being executed in September 2015 when prison officials realized they had received the wrong lethal drug, a mix-up that helped prompt a nearly seven-year moratorium on the death penalty in Oklahoma.___Follow Sean Murphy: @apseanmurphy",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848555,Lyft to pick up new CEO amid deepening post-pandemic losses,"Lyft co-founders Logan Green and John Zimmer are relinquishing their leadership roles to make way for a former Amazon executive as the ride-hailing service struggles to recover from the pandemic while long-time rival Uber has been regaining its momentum.Under the new order announced Monday, Green will step down as Lyft's CEO effective April 17 and Zimmer will give up his role as the San Francisco company's president at the end of June.David Risher, who helped build Amazon into an e-commerce powerhouse, will replace Green as CEO. Green will remain involved with Lyft as its non-executive chairman while Zimmer will be vice chairman after he leaves management.The shake-up comes about a month after Lyft disclosed that it suffered a $588 million loss for the final three months of last year, more than doubling from the same 2021 period, and provided a dismal outlook for 2023. That deepened a downturn in Lyft's stock, which has pushed its shares below $10, a roughly 80% drop from their price at the end of 2019, just a few months before the declaration of a global pandemic brought the demand for ride-hailing services to a screeching halt.While Uber's ridership has bounced back to pre-pandemic levels, Lyft hasn’t yet found a way to get back on track, causing its losses to mount and investors to bail of its stock. Uber diversified its operations to include food delivery — a popular option during government lockdowns that kept people in the habit of opening the Uber app.In a research note, Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives described Lyft's past six months as a ""train wreck"" that dictated a change in command. He said Risher had so much work in front of him that Lyft might eventually explore a sale. A deal wouldn't cost as much as it would have a few years ago, given Lyft's current market value has fallen below $4 billion, down from about $14 billion at the end of 2019.In a prepared statement, Risher said he was “gobsmacked” when he was first approached about becoming Lyft’s CEO and is now “prepared to take this business to new levels of success.”Hired as Amazon's 37th employee, Risher proved so instrumental to the Seattle company that when he left its founder, Jeff Bezos, posted a thank you note crediting Risher for helping to create a business that ""is all about: working hard, having fun, making history.""With consumers curtailing e-commerce shopping following the pandemic, Amazon has announced 27,000 layoffs since late last year.Risker had been running a San Francisco nonprofit called Worldreader focused on helping young children to read.Uber, also based in San Francisco, went through a far more tumultuous change in leadership in 2017 when its co-founder Travis Kalanick was forced out in a high-profile power struggle that was dramatized last year in a TV series on Showtime. Uber is now run by Dara Khosrowshahi, who has been trying to turn the company into the transportation equivalent of Amazon.",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848556,"Mets cut Ruf following failed trade, set opening day roster","NEW YORK (AP) — Darin Ruf was cut Monday by the Mets as the team set its opening day roster, ending his brief stint in New York following a failed trade.Speedy outfielder Tim Locastro won the final bench spot over Ruf, acquired from San Francisco at the trade deadline last August to provide the right-handed half of a DH platoon with Daniel Vogelbach.Ruf, however, batted only .152 with no homers, seven RBIs and a .413 OPS in 74 plate appearances over 28 games with the Mets.Bothered by a sore wrist this spring, he went 5 for 30 (.167) with one RBI, two extra-base hits, nine strikeouts and a .498 OPS in 11 Grapefruit League games.To get him, the Mets sent J.D. Davis, left-hander Thomas Szapucki and minor league pitchers Nick Zwack and Carson Seymour to the Giants. Davis thrived at the plate in San Francisco last year and Szapucki was moved to the bullpen, where he compiled a 1.98 ERA and 16 strikeouts in 10 relief outings covering 13 2/3 innings.The 36-year-old Ruf was designated for assignment, meaning the club has seven days to trade, release or send him outright to the minors. He is still due $3.25 million from the Mets.“It was a trade that didn’t work out. Plain and simple,” general manager Billy Eppler told reporters in Port St. Lucie, Florida.In other moves, the Mets tabbed veteran right-hander Tommy Hunter for a bullpen role, selecting him to the major league roster after bringing him to camp on a minor league deal.And with newcomer José Quintana sidelined until at least July following surgery to repair a stress fracture in his rib, fellow left-hander David Peterson won the vacant spot in the rotation over right-hander Tylor Megill, who was optioned to Triple-A Syracuse.Peterson is scheduled to start the second game of the season Friday in Miami. He will be followed Saturday by new addition Justin Verlander, lining up the three-time AL Cy Young Award winner to pitch the home opener April 6 against the Marlins.Max Scherzer will start the season opener Thursday against Marlins ace Sandy Alcantara, last year's NL Cy Young Award winner. Japanese rookie Kodai Senga and veteran right-hander Carlos Carrasco round out the rotation.NOTES: RHP Dylan Bundy would get a $2 million contract if added to the 40-man roster. New York signed Bundy to a minor league deal Saturday to provide rotation depth.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848557,76ers' Embiid sitting out showdown with Nuggets' Jokic,"The showdown between MVP front-runners fizzled Monday when Philadelphia 76ers big man Joel Embiid was ruled out against the Nuggets and star Nikola Jokic because of a sore right calf.“He's been complaining about it. Today in shootaround he just didn't like the way he was moving and it was not a hard decision for us,” 76ers coach Doc Rivers said before tip-off.Embiid, who played two games over the weekend, was at the team's shootaround Monday morning but he soon retreated to the sideline. A trainer wrapped a large ice pack on his right leg and the 76ers decided to hold him out at Denver, their third game in four nights.Rivers held Embiid out of the second half against Chicago last week when the center first complained about a tight right calf. But Embiid played in back-to-back games on the 76ers’ Western trip over the weekend, scoring 46 points in a 120-112 loss at Golden State Friday night and 28 points in a 125-105 loss at Phoenix 24 hours later.“They came to me at halftime” against the Bulls and “I said this is not a debate. He doesn't play anymore tonight,"" Rivers recounted. ""And he felt great the last two games. So, yeah, we're just going to take it slow and be smart. We want to get him and the whole team healthy for the playoffs.”Asked if he wishes he'd have held Embiid out of one of those games so he could have squared off against Jokic, Rivers said, ""Not really. That means he would have still felt it at some point. So, I think you wish that — and everyone else — because everybody wants to see these two guys play against each other.“So, no is the answer. He was healthy and when you're healthy you play and when you're not, you don't.”Rivers said he wasn't sure if Embiid would miss any more games, but reiterated his philosophy about being extra cautious with the first sign of a strained calf.Nuggets coach Michael Malone had a simple response when asked if he wished Embiid suited up to see how his team measures up against one of the league's top teams heading into the playoffs.“No,” Malone said. “Whether Joel Embiid plays or doesn't play has nothing to do with our approach. There's eight games to go and it's about us finding some consistency, especially on the defensive end.”Embiid, who has finished second to Jokic in Most Valuable Player voting each of the last two seasons, has made a late push to dethrone Jokic, although this marks the 14th game he's missed this season.Embiid leads the NBA with a 33.3-point scoring average to go along with an 10.2 rebounding average. The 76ers (49-25) trail Milwaukee and Boston in the Eastern Conference.Jokic is nearly averaging a triple-double with 24.9 points, 11.8 rebounds and 9.9 assists per game. The Nuggets (50-24) sit atop the Western Conference, three games ahead of surging Memphis entering Monday night's action.Several sportsbooks responded to Embiid's dominant post-All-Star Game stretch by bumping him ahead of Jokic as the slight MVP favorite.Several stars have missed games at Ball Arena this season, although Giannis Antetokounmpo, another MVP contender, played in Milwaukee’s 129-106 loss at Denver on Saturday, matching Jokic’s 31 points.James Harden, the league leader in assists (10.8) also participated in the 76ers' shootaround and is expected to return from a sore Achilles against the Nuggets.___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848558,"Tsitsipas wins in 1st action in Miami Open, Andreescu hurt","MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (AP) — Third-ranked Stefanos Tsitsipas beat Chilean qualifier Cristian Garin 6-3, 4-6, 6-4 at the Miami Open on Monday, the Greek's first on-court action after a bye and walkover in the opening rounds.In women's competition, 2019 U.S. Open champion Bianca Andreescu of Canada left the court in a wheelchair due to a lower left leg injury in the second set of her night match against 18th-seeded Ekaterina Alexandrova. There was no immediate word on the nature of the 22-year-old's injury or its severity.Andreescu was trailing in the match when, moving across the baseline, she fell to the court, clutching her lower left leg and screaming. A short time later, she was wheeled off to a standing ovation.Andreescu had dropped the first set 7-6 (7) and was mounting a comeback, winning the first two games of the second set when she was forced to retire, allowing Alexandrova to advance.Earlier in the day, Tsitsipas had 12 aces in his first victory since an opening-round win in Rotterdam over Emil Ruusuvuori in mid-February. He ran his record to 3-0 against Garin, who was attempting to become the first Chilean player to reach the fourth round in Miami since Fernando Gonzalez in 2010.After losing the first set, Garin won eight straight points late in the second to force a decisive third. Tsitsipas had a critical break at 4-all in the final set and advanced.Tsitsipas, who withdrew from Acapulco due to a shoulder injury and lost in the opening round in Indian Wells, overcame 21 unforced errors in his first match of the tournament.“I was waiting for a very long time to get out and play,” Tsitsipas said, according to the ATP Tour website. “It has almost felt like a vacation this past week, staying in Miami. I'm glad I got started. It was a difficult match against an opponent who has played good tennis against good opponents in the past.“I am happy with the way things turned around and my confidence towards the end. I had an eye-on-the-prize attitude and it was effective with how I played in the last game when he was serving.”Tsitsipas will take on Karen Khachanov, who eased past Czech Jiri Lehecka 6-2, 6-4, in a round-of-16 match on Tuesday.In other action, Francisco Cerundolo of Argentina surprised sixth-ranked and fifth-seeded Felix Auger-Aliassime of Canada 6-2, 7-5. Cerundolo, a semifinalist in Miami last year, has faced Auger-Aliassime in third-round matches of every ATP Masters 1000 or Grand Slam event this year — all won by the Canadian.Cerundolo said he fed off the energy of the crowd.“Super happy to get another top-10 win, another important win for me,” he said. “I think I played really good from beginning to end. Super nice to play here. A lot of Argentinian, Latin people. ... Last year was amazing. So I’m really excited to be in the round of 16 again and try to keep winning.”Cerundolo advanced to face Italy's Lorenzo Soneog, a 6-3, 6-4 winner over No. 12 seed Frances Tiafoe in one of the night matches slowed by a nearly two-hour rain delay.American Chris Eubanks also endured the nearly two-hour delay on the way to a milestone win over Frenchman Gregoire Barrere 6-3, 7-6 (9). He rallied from a 2-6 deficit in the second set and piled up a 12-1 edge in aces in the win. With the victory, the 26-year-old Eubanks, a two-time All-American at Georgia Tech, was assured of moving into the top 100 when the new rankings are released Monday.Also on Monday, Quentin Halys of France eliminated American Mackenzie McDonald 7-6 (7), 6-3. Halys will face fourth-seeded Daniil Medvedev, who advanced in a walkover. Adrian Mannarino of France beat Hubert Hurkacz of Poland 7-6 (7), 7-6 (7) and will take on Eubanks on Tuesday.In other women's action, world No. 2 Aryna Sabalenka of Belarus defeated Barbora Krejcikova of the Czech Republic in straight sets in a match that started at 10:45 p.m. because of the two-hour rain delay. Sabalenka prevailed 6-3, 6-2 for her 20th win of the year and will face Sorana Cirstea in the quarterfinals on Wednesday.American Jessica Pegula, the No. 3 seed, dispatched Poland's Magda Linette 6-1, 7-5. Pegula advanced to face 27th-seeded Anastasia Potapova, a 6-4, 7-6 (7) winner over Qinwen Zheng, in Tuesday's quarterfinals.The 29-year-old Pegula raced to a five-game lead in the opening set against Linette and then found herself tied at 5-all in the second set before closing out the win.“I think after 5-2, I don’t know what I was doing,” she said. ""It was, like ... The changeover before that I switched racquets because I thought maybe the ball was flying on me a little bit. It didn’t feel very good. Switched back to the old racquet and I won the next five games.“I don’t know why that happened, but sometimes it does. I was mad at myself that I switched racquets in the first place because it was only one break. But we got through that little mental battle I had with myself, and I was able to play very well.”In a fourth-round matches, 10th-seeded Elena Rybakina, the reigning Wimbledon champion who won the title at Indian Wells last weekend, fired off 10 aces and made short work of Elise Mertens of Belgium 6-4, 6-3. Rybakina will face Martina Trevisan of Italy in the quarterfinals.Trevisan eliminated Latvia's Jelena Ostapenko 6-3, 6-3.Also, Petra Kvitova beat Varvara Gracheva 7-5, 7-6 (7) and advanced to face Alexandrova in the quarterfinals on Wednesday. Cirstea topped Marketa Vondrousova 7-6 (7), 6-4.___AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848559,Review: 'Dungeons & Dragons' puts the funny in fantasy,"“You’re not a lot of fun, are you,” notes barbarian Holga (Michelle Rodriguez) to brave fighter Xenk (Regé-Jean Page) in the new “Dungeons & Dragons” film, making two jokes at once.The first is that Xenk, a paladin (or holy knight) in “D&D” lingo, is everything BUT fun — gorgeous, noble, heroic, smart, and did we mention gorgeous? He’s just REALLY not fun, or funny. He’s so not funny, it’s hilarious.The second, broader joke is that “Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,” hotly awaited by devotees of the decades-old role-playing game, makes darned sure to be fun, and funny — enough to laugh at itself. And that's the thing that makes it work.At least, for a newbie like me. I’ve never played the game, I confess. But this is a movie, not a game, and I’m here to tell you how it works for over two hours at the multiplex. Which is to say, surprisingly, sometimes delightfully well — even if you have no clue what a paladin or Red Wizard or Harper is, or if the term “Dungeon Master” sends your mind straight to “Fifty Shades of Grey.”The most obvious reason for this success, besides fleet-footed direction by Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley, is star Chris Pine, whose sunny charisma and smooth knack for comedy, plus an ability to seem like he’s both inside the movie and outside looking in, keeps everything bubbling.He’s ably assisted by Rodriguez, plus young accomplices Justice Smith as a confidence-challenged (but sweet) wizard and Sophia Lillis as a shape-shifting druid. And then we have a graying Hugh Grant, playing the heck out of yet another comic villain role — a character almost as curmudgeonly as he was on the Oscar red carpet.Plus there’s a cameo from another big star, but more on that in a minute. Because first we have to mention the pudgy dragon. Yes, pudgy. Whatever dragons eat, and we can only try to imagine, he’s had too many.But back to Pine, aka the bard Edgin, whom we first meet in a dank, freezing prison cell. He’s — well, he's knitting. Nearby sits Holga (Rodriguez), and her own hobby is eating. She's not a cordial sort, especially when food supply is at risk.An appearance in front of a judicial council, begging for a pardon, gives Edgin the chance to tell his backstory. Turns out he wasn't always a criminal; he was a Harper, part of a spy guild acting for the greater good, but he attracted the ire of the Red Wizards of Thay, which led to the tragic murder of his wife.Teaming with Holga, he sets out to find the magical Tablet of Reawakening that would return his wife to him and especially their baby daughter Kira (played by Chloe Coleman as a youngster). But they get captured, and their accomplice Forge (Grant), who somehow escapes, swears to take care of Kira.Edgin, a master planner, devises a jailbreak right during the pardon hearing. They discover Kira is now living in a walled city with Forge, a con-man who turns out (gasp!) to have planned the whole thing, and has convinced her that Dad betrayed her for riches. And now he’s allied with Sofina, a terrifying sorceress (Daisy Head). Forge not only refuses to give Kira back but sends Edgin and Holga to their deaths. Holga, however, quickly dispatches all the soldiers meant to kill them — all while Edgin tries, and fails, to untie a rope.Now they need that tablet, but first they need a magical helmet (bear with us.) The quest, upon which they're joined by Simon (Smith) and Doric (Lillis), leads to the film’s most entertaining scenes. One of these is an impressive, fast-paced sequence where shape-shifter Doric infiltrates enemy lines and then, chased by Sofina, morphs seamlessly into various animal forms and back to herself again.Another is a comic bit where Pine’s Edgin tries to elicit key information from a series of corpses. Summoned to life by an increasingly effective Simon, each corpse can answer five questions before returning to the grave forever. Edgin keeps wasting his chances with questions like “Did that count as a question?”And a prime comic moment comes from none other than Bradley Cooper (see, worth the wait!). We'll reveal nothing but the observation that this cameo is small, but packs a punch.Finally we have Xenk (Page), perfectly cast as a paladin so, well, perfect that he delivers babies in between vanquishing enemies, and provides the crucial help Edgin needs. But for all sorts of reasons, Edgin can’t bring himself to like the guy. Most of all, he can't deal with his lack of understanding of irony, sarcasm, and especially humor.He’s probably right. Heroism is all well and good, but humor is crucial. That’s a lesson this film has, luckily, already figured out.“Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,” a Paramount Pictures release, has been rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association of America “for fantasy action/violence and some language.” Running time: 134 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four.MPAA definition of PG-13: Parents strongly cautioned. Some material may be inappropriate for children under 13.",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848560,Food for thought: Free meals for all New Mexico students,"ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) — Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham on Monday signed legislation to provide free school meals to all students regardless of family income, as New Mexico and several other states look to fill the gap left by lapsed federal pandemic-era benefit programs and address the strain to family budgets caused by food prices.The bill cleared the Legislature during the recent 60-day session, with lawmakers setting aside more than $22 million in the state budget to help pay for the program. Additional money will be used to improve school kitchens so healthier meals can be prepared.“When we feed our children, we’re feeding our future – these investments today will yield benefits tomorrow through generations of healthier New Mexicans,” the Democratic governor said in a statement issued after she celebrated with dozens of elementary school students.California and Maine have made universal meals permanent, legislation to do so is advancing in Vermont, and Nevada pitched in $75 million to extend free school meals for this school year. In Colorado, voters approved a ballot measure last fall giving school districts the opportunity to offer free lunches.Nationally, debts for unpaid school meals have been rising, indicating the need to continue providing free meals to ensure students are able to concentrate in the classroom. A recent report issued by the Food Research & Action Center showed participation in school breakfast and lunch programs was higher during the last school year than that of pre-pandemic levels.About 67% — or 309,000 New Mexico students — are eligible to receive free and reduced-price lunches through the National School Lunch Program, according to the New Mexico Public Education Department.Signing of the legislation could impact nearly 70,000 students who normally would have had to pay for school meals, with department officials expecting a 5% to 10% increase in participation in districts that operate national school lunch programs.Lujan Grisham included the proposal in her State of the State address, saying that wherever kids are, there ought to be a kitchen working to keep them healthy, strong and ready to learn.Still, some say more money will be needed to bankroll the effort over time. This year, New Mexico was awash in new revenue due in part to a financial windfall from oil production.Legislative analysts have estimated that providing meals at no costs to students at participating schools could total between $27 million and $40 million in recurring funding from the state's general fund.Advocacy groups see universal free school meals as the next step in New Mexico's march toward combating historically high food insecurity rates in a state that has long struggled with generational poverty. Other recent efforts include legislation in 2020 that eliminated student co-pays for reduced-price school meals and a 2017 measure that made New Mexico the first state in the U.S. to ensure children can’t be humiliated by school meal debts.The new law aims to boost the amount of food that comes from local growers through farm-to-table grants. Currently, about 168 farmers, ranchers and food businesses sell locally produced products to schools in 19 of the state's 33 counties.Supporters also hope the new law will lead to less food waste by requiring kindergarten through sixth grade students to have more time to sit down and eat, and by collecting unused food for use by food pantries, students and other charitable organizations.",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848561,Wrexham to play Man United in friendly in San Diego,"SAN DIEGO (AP) — Soccer sensation Wrexham is coming to America. Not just on television screens, but on the pitch.The fifth-tier Welsh side, which has become a fan favorite since Hollywood stars Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney bought it and launched a documentary series, “Welcome to Wrexham,” will play Manchester United in a friendly on July 25 at San Diego State's 35,000-seat Snapdragon Stadium.“We hope to become America's team — sorry,"" McElhenney said at news conference Monday, where he shared the dais with Andrew Cole, a former Manchester United player who is now an ambassador for the hugely popular team, and former U.S. national team star Landon Donovan, who is co-owner and executive vice president of soccer operations for the San Diego Loyal.Wrexham will compete in a $1 million, winner-take-all, seven-on-seven tournament in June in Cary, North Carolina. But the match against Manchester United in the United States will be much bigger for many reasons.“Not bad, not bad,” McElhenney said. “We've been very clear from the very beginning that our ultimate goal is to get to the Premier League, which a lot of people laughed at, but I don't think they're laughing at us much now. The truth is, the system is in place for that very thing to happen.“We had hoped that at some point we'd be playing Manchester United in the Premier League,"" he added. ""We didn't realize it would be in three years. Obviously this is a friendly. We had hoped that maybe in eight to 10 years time we'd actually be playing with you guys,” McIlhenney said to Cole.McElhenney said Wrexham will play other friendlies while in the United States with specific details to come.Reynolds and McElhenney took over beleaguered Wrexham in February 2021 and their documentary — about their journey, the team, its fans and its city — premiered in August. Wrexham is the third-oldest football team in the world and plays in the English National League, the fifth tier of professional soccer.“I believe we can become America’s football team because we don’t have to worry about the regionalization, right?” McElhenney said. “I’m a massive Philadelphia Eagles fan, so American football, and obviously if you're trying to grow that fan base in the U.S. it's tricky because there are various regions where people have their own teams. So with an English football team, or a Welsh team that plays in the English system, we don't have to worry about that regionalization. So you can be from Des Moines, you can be from Minnesota, you can be from West Texas and be a Wrexham fan.”McElhenney, who was wearing a Wrexham cap, said the team keeps selling out of its gear and knows it has a fan base on this side of the Atlantic Ocean.“We know it's a lot of Americans, we obviously know the postal codes, but also because a lot of baseball caps are getting sold and that's not a huge market in the UK,"" he said.Several local United supporters attended the news conference and McElhenney told them: ""One more thing I’ve found about football, too, is you can have two teams. Because we’re separated by so many leagues — for the time being — you can have two teams. They’re going to play their hearts out. Maybe you can fall in love with our team as well.”The match will be part of a summer U.S. tour by Manchester United. A youth-focused team drawn from its traveling squad, supplemented by academy prospects, will face Wrexham as part of a week-long training camp in San Diego.Cole said he hasn't seen “Welcome to Wrexham” but knows that the documentary is “spreading football. Football is a global game. Even if you don't know about football, when it comes to World Cup time, everyone watches football. It's a language, football is. I think what Wrexham are doing is absolutely fantastic, having the opportunity to come out here and play football out here and spread it throughout the world.”Donovan said it's a big deal that this match is coming to San Diego, which is growing in stature in the soccer world.""You can argue that these are the two most relevant soccer clubs, certainly by American standards,"" Donovan said. “I will say this anecdotally — my wife knows nothing about football/soccer at all. She knows who Manchester United is and she knows who Wrexham AFC is now, probably because two cute guys run the show.""On Saturday night, a crowd of 30,854 at Snapdragon Stadium — a record for a National Women's Soccer League opener — watched star Alex Morgan score on a penalty kick in the 88th minute of the San Diego Wave's 3-2 win against the Chicago Red Stars.San Diego reportedly is in line for an MLS expansion team by December.___AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848562,Voter abstention rises in Cuban National Assembly election,"HAVANA (AP) — Cuba's government reported Monday that abstention in National Assembly elections was 24.1%, a figure some analysts said reflects discontent with the island's economic crisis as well as a rise in apathy.While a 75.9% voter turnout in Sunday’s voting is high compared with other countries, it is about nine percentage points lower than voter turnout in Cuba's 2018 National Assembly elections and far lower than the 94.2% turnout seen in 2013.Since there was only one candidate running for each of the 470 legislative seats, turnout was watched by observers as a political thermometer.“It is evident that the government is dealing with less unconditional support from its bases,” said Arturo López-Levy, a professor at the Autonomous University of Madrid.Cuba’s economy was badly hit by the pandemic and increased U.S. sanctions, and the island nation has seen a surge in migration along with power outages and fuel shortages. The communist-ruled nation was rocked by rare protests in July 2021 and October 2022.Michael Shifter, a senior fellow at the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington think tank, said the 24% abstention is high in historical terms since the general average for non-participation has been 10%.Shifter described abstention in Cuba as a complex phenomenon that could reflect discontent with the government’s “bad performance” and “apathy or disinterest.”The voter turnout figures from Sunday’s legislative voting were announced by Alina Balseiro, president of the National Electoral Council. She said that of 8.1 million people registered to vote, 6.1 million voted. Some 6.2% of the ballots were blank and 3.5% voided.While critics contend that voters in Cuba's legislative elections do no more than endorse a slate of candidates vetted by Communist Party officials, Cuban officials say the system is inclusive and builds unity, while steering clear of the divisiveness of party politics or any ill effects of big-money donors.Voting in Cuba is not compulsory but traditionally was considered a national duty.National Assembly elections are held every five years and are technically nonpartisan. But they fall under the indirect control of the Communist Party.Half of the 470 candidates came from municipal assemblies chosen in local elections last November. The other half were nominated by groups representing broad swaths of society, such as a women’s group and workers unions. All were vetted by election committees with ties to the party.The National Assembly is nominally the country’s highest governing power. It approves laws and votes for the president and executive officials from among its members.The new National Assembly is expected to convene April 19.",2023/03/28,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848581,Rare beetle species named after ex-California governor Brown,"BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) — Scientists are naming a rare species of beetle in honor of former California Gov. Jerry Brown after finding one at his ranch.Bembidion brownorum was last seen in 1966, but it hadn't been named or described until one was collected near a creek on Brown's ranch in Colusa County, about an hour's drive northwest of Sacramento, the University of California, Berkeley announced Monday.The beetle is brown and tiny at about 5 millimeters (0.20 inch) long, although that is still larger than other Bembidion beetles. Under magnification “it glows with a green and gold metallic shimmer,” according to UC Berkeley.Brown, who left office in 2019, lives in California's inner coastal mountain range on land that has been in his family since the 1860s. He has offered his property as a meeting space for the California Native Plant Society, entomologist, and forestry and fire experts.UC Berkeley entomologist Kipling Will has been sampling insects at the 2,500-acre (1,012-hectare) ranch for more than two years. On July 1, 2021, he found an unfamiliar beetle and called up an expert, David Maddison at Oregon State University, to help identify it, UC Berkeley said.They determined that it was a species that hadn't been previously named or described. Will later found 21 specimens in museums throughout California, although they may have been unlabeled or misidentified, UC Berkeley said.The species probably was rarely spotted because it probably has been rapidly declining as its habitat is destroyed by urbanization and agricultural development, Will said.The beetle was named in honor of Brown and his wife, Anne Brown.“I’m very glad that (my ranch) is advancing science in some interesting and important ways,” Brown said in the UC Berkeley statement.“There are so many undiscovered species,” he said. “I think it’s very important that we catalog and discover what we have and understand their impact on the environment — how it’s functioning and how it’s changing.”Will and Maddison described the beetle in a study published Monday in the journal ZooKeys. John S. Sproul of the University of Nebraska Omaha is a co-author.“As of the moment of publication this morning the species was formally named,” Will said through UC Berkeley in answer to a question by The Associated Press. ""If the question is about a ceremony of some sort, no we don’t do that.”",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848582,"GMs for Packers, Jets discuss status of Rodgers trade talks","PHOENIX (AP) — Green Bay Packers general manager Brian Gutekunst said he’s not requiring a first-round pick in a potential trade sending four-time MVP quarterback Aaron Rodgers to the New York Jets but added he’d want “fair value.”Gutekunst was asked Monday at the NFL annual meeting if there was any way in which he could feel comfortable trading Rodgers without getting a first-round pick in return.“Yeah, I think that’s not a necessity,” Gutekunst told reporters. “But at the same time, the value of the player – he’s a premier player, so getting premier picks back for (premier) players is important.”Gutekunst and Jets general manager Joe Douglas both discussed trade talks involving the 39-year-old Rodgers, who said March 15 during an appearance on “The Pat McAfee Show” on SiriusXM and YouTube that he intends to play for the Jets in 2023.Rodgers remains under contract with Green Bay but said he wanted the Packers to “do the right thing.”“There’s been some productive conversations. Obviously, we’re not where we need to be yet. But feel like we’re in a good place.” Douglas said, adding he’s “very optimistic.”Gutekunst said that “hopefully, we can come to an agreement sooner than later” but indicated he could afford to wait until May or June to make a trade if necessary.“Yeah, I think so,” Gutekunst said. “Again, there’s not much going on right now. So, again, I think it has to work for both parties and I think we’re both committed to figuring that out. It’s really kind of in their court right now. We’ll kind of see where it goes.”Gutekunst also said he tried unsuccessfully to speak with Rodgers on multiple occasions this offseason before the quarterback’s representatives told him the four-time MVP was requesting a trade.Rodgers and Gutekunst met shortly after Green Bay’s season ended with a 20-16 loss to the Detroit Lions that snapped the Packers’ string of three straight playoff appearances. Gutekunst said they’d planned to have follow-up conversations.“Those never transpired,” Gutekunst said. “So there came a time where we had to make some decisions so we went through his representatives to try to talk to him (about) where we were going with our team. And at that point, they informed us that he would like to be traded to the Jets.”That account conflicts with what Rodgers said during his appearance on “The Pat McAfee Show.”Rodgers said he wished the Packers had told him early in the offseason that they intended to move on from him in the 2023 season. Rodgers said instead that after returning from his isolation retreat last month, he “heard from multiple people that I trust around the league — players mostly –— that there was some shopping going on, that they were interested in actually moving me.”“The Packers would like to move on,” Rodgers said. “They’ve let me know that in so many words. They’ve let other people know that in direct words.”Gutekunst said he wanted to have more discussions with Rodgers earlier in the offseason to discuss how the veteran quarterback could fit in the Packers’ future plans.“(With) our inability to reach him or for him to respond in any way, I think at that point, I had to do my job and kind of reach out and, understanding that a trade could be possible and see who was interested,” Gutekunst said.A trade of Rodgers would clear the way for 2020 first-round pick Jordan Love to take over as Green Bay’s starting quarterback.Gutekunst was asked if there’s any scenario in which Rodgers starts another game for the Packers.“I think right now all options are on the table,” Gutekunst said. “It’s not trending that way, and we’re very hopeful we can facilitate this (trade) and get this accomplished. But he’s come back under certain circumstances before where maybe he wasn’t the happiest with everything that was going on and played very well. So we’ll just kind of see how all of this transpires.“I think it’s trending hopefully in the right direction for what everybody wants, and we can conclude this hopefully.” ___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/03/28,,World

(AP) — Police in Little Rock, Arkansas say gunfire erupted as a crowd of people gathered along a commercial boulevard southwest of downtown known for “caravanning,” or large processions of drivers cruising on city streets. Two people died and five were wounded as law enforcement sought clues for who may have opened fire, the police chief said Monday.Police Chief Heath Helton told reporters that officers responded to the shooting around 9:25 p.m. Sunday on Asher Avenue. Malachi Carey, 20, died at the scene, and Jailene Washington, also 20, died at a local hospital, Helton said. One of those wounded was in serious condition at a hospital Monday afternoon, he said.Helton said a large number of cars had gathered at the location where the shootings occurred. Police interviewed witnesses from the city and from outside of Little Rock and determined some sort of argument led to the gunfire, Helton said. It wasn't known how many suspects police were trying to find.Helton said police patrolling the area of tire sales and repair shops and other commercial establishments — as well as the city at large — have been dealing with so-called “caravanning” and that it may have played a factor in Sunday's shooting.“We saw a large number of people influx into the city which is not uncommon with the caravanning and things we have witnessed over the years,” the chief said.The city passed ordinances last year banning caravanning and street racing.Sunday's shooting did not appear to be related to an earlier incident nearby in which a woman said she may have been grazed by a bullet when someone shot at her car, Helton said.",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848584,Christie: GOP needs someone who can quickly take down Trump,"MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) — Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said Monday that Republicans need a candidate who can take out Donald Trump in a single, brutal swipe like the one Christie delivered to a different rival in 2016.Speaking in New Hampshire, Christie recalled a favorite moment from his failed presidential campaign: embarrassing Marco Rubio on a debate stage three days before the first-in-the-nation primary. After Christie challenged Rubio’s lack of experience, the senator from Florida repeated himself twice in a cringe-worthy moment capped off by Christie saying: “There it is. The memorized 25-second speech. There it is, everybody.”Trump will never step aside quietly, said Christie, who is mulling another run himself.“You better have somebody on that stage who can do to him what I did to Marco, because that's the only thing that's gonna defeat Donald Trump,” he said at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at Saint Anselm College. “And that means you have to be fearless, because he will come back, and right at you.”Voters need to think about who has the skills and guts to do that, Christie warned.“Because it’s not going to end nicely, no matter what, his end will not be a calm and quiet conclusion,” he said.While that debate moment was a high point for Christie, he dropped out less than a week later after finishing a dismal sixth in the New Hampshire Republican primary that year. He quickly endorsed Trump and was a close on-and-off adviser to Trump during his time in the White House, but broke with the former president after Trump refused to accept his loss of the 2020 election.Christie has since emerged as one of the few prominent Trump critics in his party and has used his position as an ABC political analyst to argue that Trump is a far weaker today than he was in the past. On Monday, he accused Trump of leading Republicans down a “sinkhole of anger and retribution.”“Donald Trump said a couple of weeks ago, ‘I am your retribution.’ Guess what everybody? No thanks. No dice,” Christie said Monday. “He doesn't want to be my retribution. That's baloney. The only person he cares about is him.”Saul Shriber, 67, of Chester, said he voted for Christie in 2016 even though he wasn't happy with the answer he got when he asked Christie, “When are you going to take down Trump?”“I have my timetable,” Christie said at the time.“I thought, if there's anybody on the stage who could go after Trump, it would be him, the smash-mouth New Jersey guy,” Shriber said.Reminded of their encounter Monday, Christie said he and the other candidates made a “strategic error"" in thinking they'd get a chance to take on Trump one-on-one. Instead, their campaigns folded quickly.Shriber found that answer satisfactory and said he would support Christie again.“If he chose to talk to me truthfully, I’m all in favor,” he said. “I’m willing to forgive.”New Hampshire was the linchpin of Christie’s 2016 campaign. The then-governor camped out in the state for months, holding dozens of town halls — a format he became famous for in New Jersey, as his colorful commentary and spirited clashes with critics frequently went viral.Christie said earlier this month that he expects to make a decision in the next 45 to 60 days.____Associated Press writer Jill Colvin contributed to this report.",2023/03/28,,World

Merritt, 40, was also charged with unlawfully carrying a weapon, police said.Merritt, who's forged a national profile representing the families of people killed by law enforcement officers, told The Associated Press that he was “unlawfully arrested” while he attended the protests as the Scott family's lawyer. The attorney said he had been legally carrying a firearm at the time of his arrest, which led to the weapons charge.Merritt was released from jail Monday. The Collin County district attorney's office did not respond to a phone message about whether prosecutors would pursue the charges.The demonstration came two years after Scott, 26, died during a struggle with jail guards following his arrest on a marijuana possession charge. Scott’s family said he was likely in a mental health crisis at the time of his death and a medical examiner found he had been diagnosed with schizophrenia.Seven detention officers were fired and another resigned over Scott’s death, which was ruled a homicide, but did not result in criminal charges.Scott's 30-year-old sister, Lachay Batts, was also among those arrested in the protest. Merritt said being held in the same facility where her brother died was “a really traumatic experience” for Batts.A McKinney police spokesperson said in a statement that officers made the arrests after giving “approximately 10 minutes of warnings” to the demonstrators, who included children, to clear the roadway. Protesters told officers they wanted to be arrested, according to the statement.Merritt, who and made a failed run for the Democratic nomination for Texas attorney general during the last election, said the third person taken into custody was a photojournalist.

(AP) — The Los Angeles Rams re-signed defensive lineman Marquise Copeland on Monday, temporarily halting their wholesale roster exodus after the team's first losing season in six years.The Rams didn't announce the terms of the deal for Copeland. Los Angeles didn't tender Copeland as a restricted free agent earlier this month, which means his new deal likely is worth less than that price tag of roughly $3 million.Copeland spent most of his first 2 1/2 NFL seasons on the Rams' practice squad before joining the active roster in November 2021. He has played in 25 games with nine starts.He got extensive playing time last season with Aaron Donald sidelined by injury, and he finished with 31 tackles and one sack. Copeland is likely to get extensive playing time again this season with the departure of starter Greg Gaines for Tampa Bay and the probable departure of free-agent starter A'Shawn Robinson.Copeland is just the second free agent to re-sign this offseason with the Rams, whose roster has been badly depleted while the club attempts to reset its payroll after years of high-profile acquisitions. Offensive lineman Coleman Shelton also re-signed with Los Angeles on a modest deal.The Rams have lost well over a dozen key contributors to their Super Bowl championship team and last season's 5-12 squad. Los Angeles’ top six defenders by snap count will not return next season for coach Sean McVay.Jalen Ramsey left in a trade with Miami, while the free-agent departures and releases include starting linebackers Bobby Wagner and Leonard Floyd, starting safeties Nick Scott and Taylor Rapp, cornerback David Long Jr., starting offensive guard David Edwards, kicker Matt Gay, punter Riley Dixon, kick returner Brandon Powell, long snapper Matthew Orzech and quarterback Baker Mayfield.Despite the massive roster overhaul, chief operating officer Kevin Demoff told their season ticket holders in a letter that the Rams expect to contend for the NFC West title next season and “make a run” toward the Super Bowl.“We always knew that there would be a time when we would have to pull back on our typical approach to help continue our sustained run of success,” Demoff wrote, adding that the Rams “have taken all of our salary cap pain in 2023 and project to have more than $60 million in space in 2024.""___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/03/28,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848589,Taiwan told to 'pack up and leave' Honduras after ties severed,"TEGUCIGALPA, March 27 (Reuters) - Taiwan must vacate its embassy in Honduras within 30 days, a senior Honduran official said on Monday, after President Xiomara Castro severed ties with Taiwan in favor of China in a bid for more investment and jobs from the Asian giant.
Deputy Foreign Minister Antonio Garcia issued the order on local television on Monday, following the government's announcement over the weekend that it had opened formal diplomatic relations with Beijing while simultaneously ending its decades-long relationship with Taiwan.
Castro's main conservative opposition later announced it would reverse the opening to China if it regains power.
China has long-argued that democratically ruled Taiwan is part of its own territory with no right to state-to-state ties, a position Taipei strongly rejects. Communist-run China demands that countries it has ties with must adopt its position.
Taipei's embassy in Tegucigalpa's leafy Palmira neighborhood was for years one of the Central American capital's most prominent foreign outposts, as well as the country's second-biggest embassy after the U.S. embassy.
In his remarks, Garcia said 30 days ""is more than enough time to pack up and leave,"" adding that officials aim for an ""orderly, friendly"" exit.
The deputy minister also stressed the need for a diplomatic mission to the world's second-biggest economy.
""We have to go there to explore the big projects that China can give us,"" he said, suggesting that China could invest some $10 billion in Honduras in a boon for local workers.
The foreign ministry also announced that Honduran students with scholarships in Taiwan would be able to transfer their studies to China.
Late on Saturday, the Honduran foreign ministry recognized the People's Republic of China, China's formal name, as the only legitimate government that represents all of China and that Taiwan is an ""inseparable part of Chinese territory.""
The move leaves Taiwan with only 13 formal allies, mostly poor and developing countries in Central America, the Caribbean and the Pacific.
In its own statement later on Monday, the conservative National Party pledged to re-establish ties with Taiwan if it can retake the Honduran presidency in 2026.
""We will do the impossible to restore relations with our brothers and sisters in the Republic of Taiwan,"" it said, promising to enshrine allegiance to Taiwan in the country's constitution.TEGUCIGALPA, March 27 (Reuters) - Taiwan must vacate its embassy in Honduras within 30 days, a senior Honduran official said on Monday, after President Xiomara Castro severed ties with Taiwan in favor of China in a bid for more investment and jobs from the Asian giant.Deputy Foreign Minister Antonio Garcia issued the order on local television on Monday, following the government's announcement over the weekend that it had opened formal diplomatic relations with Beijing while simultaneously ending its decades-long relationship with Taiwan.Castro's main conservative opposition later announced it would reverse the opening to China if it regains power.China has long-argued that democratically ruled Taiwan is part of its own territory with no right to state-to-state ties, a position Taipei strongly rejects.

With this new addition, JC Movers aims to expand their storage capacity to meet the needs of their growing pool of customers as well as provide affordable options for offices, restaurants, and families who are looking for storage whilst their place undergoes renovation. A statement to their success, the existing warehouse at Balestier is currently full, making it significantly challenging for them to take in additional storage requests.

To further boost the prevention of mould, JC Movers will also be offering additional preventive measures, such as mould prevention products, that can be opted on top of the storage service. The facility will also be secured 24/7 with weekly cleaning conducted by their team of movers to prevent unwanted pests.         Currently, at JC Movers, they offer residential and    commercial moving services, storage services, and disposal services. For all new upcoming clients, the newly added storage facility in Tampines is fully ready for bookings and any new storage will be placed at the new warehouse.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848610,El Salvador marks its first year under anti-gang crackdown,"SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) — The Central American nation of El Salvador marked a full year Monday under anti-gang emergency measures that were originally supposed to last only a month.It was the the first anniversary of President Nayib Bukele’s request for special powers to pursue gangs last March 27, following a surge in gang violence in which 62 people were killed in a single day.The country’s legislature has voted every month since then to renew the measures, which suspend some rights.In the year since, a total of 66,417 people have been arrested, and 4,304 have been released. Rights groups say there have been 111 deaths in custody and 5,802 suspected cases of rights violations.The emergency decree has reduced violence and proved popular in a country where streets gangs like MS-13 and Barrio 18 have long killed and extorted money from residents.Jorge Ezequiel Bran, a 25-year-old hotdog vendor in the nation's capital, said he approved of the crackdown, though he acknowledged there have been abuses.“It's no secret that there have been unjust arrests,” Bran said. “There will always be errors, nothing is perfect, but for me, it (the crackdown) is good.”Polls suggest over eight of every 10 Salvadorans support the measures.Recalling last March 27 when the last homicide wave occurred, Bukele wrote in his Twitter account “that was one of the most difficult days of my life.”Referring to police reports that there were no killings in El Salvador on Sunday, Bukele wrote triumphantly, “Now, a year later, we closed with zero homicides, and March 2023 is on track to be the safest month in our history.”Under the special powers, police don’t have to tell someone being arrested the reason or inform them of their rights. Someone arrested does not have a right to a lawyer and can be held for 15 days without seeing a judge rather than the previous 72 hours. Telephone lines can be tapped more easily.Bukele gave no signs he is planning to return to normal police procedures soon. Security Minister Gustavo Villatoro told a local television channel that he thinks the government has yet to arrest “35% of (gang) members.”The government has used controversial tactics like locking up thousands of gang suspects in a huge new prison built especially for gang members. At other prisons, inmates were crowded together and have seen their food rations reduced.A recent government video posted on social media showed prisoners forced to run barefoot and handcuffed down stairways and over bare ground, clad only in regulation white shorts. They were then forced to sit with their legs locked in closely clumped groups in cells.Villatoro denied accusations that Bukele had negotiated with gangs prior to declaring the crackdown. He said that “could not be possible.”The U.S. Treasury Department alleges Bukele’s government had previously tried to buy the gangs’ support with financial benefits and privileges for their imprisoned leaders, including prostitutes and cellphones.A coalition of local rights groups say they have documented 111 deaths of suspects in custody, and 5,802 cases of human rights abuses under the state of emergency, including cruel and degrading treatment.Anabel Belloso, a legislator for the leftist FMLN party, said the crackdown has brought “mass arrests without investigation,” sweeping up “the innocent and the guilty alike.”",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848611,Doctor decries gun violence after school shooting near miss,"A pediatric surgeon who left The Covenant School in Nashville moments before a shooter opened fire, killing six people, says she is horrified by the gun violence that has plagued the U.S.Britney Grayson had just finished regaling children at the small religious grade school about Kenya, where she works on missions, when she drove out of the parking lot looking for a Starbucks. Moments later, the shooter entered the school and opened fire, killing three children and three adults.After she received a text alerting her to the attack, Grayson took to Facebook to post about what she experienced, writing, “WHY ARE OUR CHILDREN BEING MASSACRED IN THEIR SCHOOLS?!”If a mass shooting is defined as resulting in the death of four or more people, not including the perpetrator, 175 people have died in 15 such events connected to U.S. schools and colleges since 1999.The horror of what happened had Grayson rattled hours later.“It’s a weird feeling, knowing that just if it had happened just moments earlier, one, we might have been victims ourselves, and two, maybe I would have been there to offer immediate care,” she said.In her post, Grayson wrote that she has operated on a school shooting victim. But, she says, she has never felt as close to the violence as she did this time.“It’s different when you receive a patient at the hospital. I’m on my turf. I have all my skills and or tools with me and all of the team and everything,” she said. “That is definitely different than what we experienced today.”Grayson notes that even those who survived Monday's violence will be forever changed. She says the U.S. is laying the burden of gun violence at the feet of children.“Physically in the children that died, but also all of the children that were there today,"" she said. ”The counseling that’s going to be required and the way that this is going to affect their lives forever.""Grayson wrote on Facebook that the kids were great and learned about Kenya, some Swahili words and what it means to be a missionary.Later, when an initial death toll came out, she posted an update: “3 children are confirmed dead. 3 children who learned the word ‘Jambo’ this morning from us in chapel,” she wrote, using the Swahili greeting. “3 children who didn’t have to die. Lord be with us. Lord, be with us.”",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848612,"March Madness: Boston, South Carolina women reach Final Four","GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) — Dawn Staley knows what's next for unbeaten South Carolina — a matchup the whole women's college basketball world is eager to see.But for now, the coach wants to revel in her extraordinary Gamecocks and their amazing achievements.Aliyah Boston had 22 points and 10 rebounds and top-seeded South Carolina used its smothering defense to stop Maryland 86-75 Monday night and reach its third straight Final Four.Do-it-all star Caitlin Clark and the Hawkeyes await in the national semifinals in Dallas on Friday, a game featuring two of the biggest stars in the sport. That can wait a bit. Her players deserve that, Staley said.“I just want to enjoy this and just give our players an opportunity to be talked about,” Staley said. “The joy that I feel for this team to be able to be where they are, I’m just really happy.”Staley's team improved to 36-0 this season with its 42nd straight victory dating to last year's NCAA title run. The Gamecocks are now two games away from repeating as champions and completing the 10th undefeated season in the women's game.The Gamecocks hugged and jumped when it was over. It's the fifth Final Four since 2015, all under Staley. She'll try for her third national title next week.“Not a lot of teams can say they’re able to do this,” Boston said. ""So for us to be able to do it feels really good, and it’s such a blessing we won’t ever take for granted.""Zia Cooke finished with 18 points and Brea Beal 16 for the Gamecocks.Boston, the 6-foot-5 senior, made 10 of 14 shots. The three-time All-American added five assists, two blocked shots and was named the Greenville 1 Regional's most outstanding player.Staley ran around the court thanking players, coaches and supporters. She hugged the pep band director and cheered on the musicians with a glowing smile.Maryland (28-7) was routed at home, 81-56, by the Gamecocks last Nov. 11, but played without injured All-American Diamond Miller.With a healthy Miller and an offense averaging nearly 80 points a game, the Terrapins were ready to take on the big, imposing Gamecocks. Maryland pushed the pace early, disrupting South Carolina's No. 1 defense and was ahead 21-15 as an edgy, pro-Gamecock crowd wasn't sure what it was watching.South Carolina didn't panic. Cooke shook off an 0-for-3 start to score nine points. Boston was her steady self with 12 points in the half as the Gamecocks outscored the Terps 23-9 in the second quarter to lead 38-30 at halftime.“I thought the game was lost in the second quarter,” Maryland coach Brenda Frese said. “Their size, their depth, they wear you out.”Maryland got two quick baskets after the break to cut South Carolina's lead to 48-42. But the Gamecocks answered with a 14-3 burst to take control for good.Miller led the Terps, looking for their first trip to the Final Four since 2015, with 24 points. Miller picked up a technical foul late in the game and thought it was an unevenly called game. “I'm not going to say the refs lost us the game,” she said. “I mean, they outrebounded us as we kind of expected.""Maryland shot 50% for the game, yet couldn't hold up down low against the Gamecocks. South Carolina outrebounded the Terps 48-26 and 25-7 on the offensive glass.BIG PICTUREMaryland: Terps have seven seniors, including Miller and four other starters. But Shyanne Sellers is a rising sophomore and likely focal point for Maryland the next couple of seasons. Expect Frese to work hard in the offseason to scour the portal for additions who can augment Maryland's young roster.South Carolina: These are certainly the glory days for Gamecocks women's basketball. Maryland gave Iowa a glimpse into what may rattle the Gamecocks, although they quickly adjusted to gain control. But tightening up to prevent easy layups the Terps got early will certainly be a focus at South Carolina's practices this week.CLAIRVOYANT COACHTurns out, LSU coach Kim Mulkey knew what she was talking about. She declared Sunday night after her team won the Greenville 2 Region to reach the Final Four that the Southeastern Conference would have half the field next week.“The champion, South Carolina is going. I’m just telling you flat out. I’m getting ahead of myself, OK, but you write it. They’re going,"" she said.The Tigers and Gamecocks could play for a championship should both advance.RACKING UP ACCOLADESStaley joined UConn's Geno Auriemma, Stanford's Tara VanDerveer and Mulkey as active coaches with five or more trips to the Final Four. Staley's first visit came in 2015, then she led the Gamecocks to a title in 2017. The Gamecocks have been the past three, losing to Stanford in the semifinals in 2021 before winning it all last year in Minneapolis.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848613,Mavericks end 4-game skid vs. Pacers to stay in playoff hunt,"INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Luka Doncic started Monday hopeful he would play at Indiana.A few hours later, NBA officials announced they had rescinded the All-Star’s most recent technical foul and the subsequent one-game suspension. Doncic responded to that news with the kind of dazzling performance the Dallas Mavericks desperately needed for their final playoff push.He finished with 25 points, seven rebounds and six assists, helping the Mavericks snap a four-game losing streak with a dominant 127-104 victory over the short-handed Indiana Pacers.“That's what he does,” coach Jason Kidd said. “He's one of the best players in the league at finding guys and then he's able to catch and shoot — not just once but multiple times.”The victory keeps Dallas within striking distance of the Los Angeles Lakers and Oklahoma City Thunder in the race for the final two play-in spots in the Western Conference.Kyrie Irving added 16 points and six assists for Dallas.Indiana was led by Bennedict Mathurin, who scored 22 points, and Andrew Nembhard, who had 17 points, five rebounds and five assists on a night the Pacers were missing three starters and a key backup.Indiana has lost three straight and six of eight as they move closer to locking up a lottery pick. And they had no chance with Doncic working his magic.“It's tough,” Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said. “Luka makes a couple of passes that were unbelievable, that only one player in the world can make.”Dallas took control after a back-and-forth first quarter by starting the second on a 14-2 run to make it 43-29. The Mavericks led 59-47 at the half, extended the advantage to 77-56 midway through the third quarter and just kept pulling away.Doncic had picked up his 16th technical that was rescinded on Sunday in the team's second loss to Charlotte. The technical came with 7:51 remaining in the third quarter of a 110-104 loss when Doncic argued a no-call after missing a shot on a drive to the basket.Crew chief Kevin Scott said in a pool report after the game that Doncic used “a profanity directed at the officials in protest to a no-call that was correctly judged in postgame video review.”TIP-INSMavericks: Rookie Jaden Hardy had 20 points as six players scored in double figures. ... Tim Hardaway Jr. finished with 13 points and Reggie Bullock had 11 and JaVale McGee added 10. ... The Mavericks completed the season series tied at 1-1 for the fifth consecutive season. They lost 124-122 on their home court in February.Pacers: Jordan Nwora had 13 points and nine rebounds, while Isaiah Jackson had 12 rebounds. ... T.J. McConnell finished with 15 points, five rebounds and seven assists. ... When the Cleveland Cavaliers clinched a playoff spot Sunday, the Pacers secured the Cavs' first-round pick in this year's draft courtesy of last season's deal for Caris LeVert.TECHNICALLY SPEAKINGCarlisle, Doncic's former coach in Dallas, said he wasn't surprised by the league's decision.In fact, Carlisle thinks the league should rescind more technical calls. Perhaps that's because he already has a league-leading 11 among coaches this season.“I don't know how many I have, I just know I've surpassed the five the team can pay for,"" he said. “It's kind of, you know, they're not cheap so if you're going to get them, you better get your money's worth.”HIELD HELD OUTCarlisle also said Buddy Hield missed his first game of the season with a non-COVID-19 illness.It wasn't by choice. Team doctors told Carlisle that Hield could not play earlier Monday and the Pacers' top 3-point shooter wasn't even on the bench. Hield's 271 3-pointers this season rank second in the league, two behind Klay Thompson.Indiana also played without All-Star guard Tyrese Haliburton and starting center Myles Turner, who were listed as injury management, and backup guard Chris Duarte (sore left ankle).UP NEXTMavericks: Make their third stop on a five-game trip Wednesday at Philadelphia.Pacers: Host Eastern Conference-leading Milwaukee on Wednesday.___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848614,Idaho Senate passes ban on gender-affirming care for minors,"BOISE, Idaho (AP) — The Idaho Senate on Monday voted 22-12 to pass a bill criminalizing gender-affirming healthcare for minors, one month after the state House passed similar legislation.The measure bars transgender and transitioning children, or children with gender dysphoria, from receiving hormones or puberty blockers to alleviate their symptoms or help them with transitioning, KTVB reported Monday.Doctors prescribing these hormones or blockers could be charged with a felony and face prison time.The Senate will send the measure back to the House for consideration of the Senate amendments. If the House agrees, the bill will go to Gov. Brad Little.Republican lawmakers in more than two dozen states have pushed for bans on gender-affirming care this year, targeting what doctors and psychologists widely consider medically necessary care.The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends gender affirming care to treat children struggling with gender dysphoria. The organization says those who struggle with the condition are more likely to think about suicide or attempt suicide.Before the vote, Sen. Melissa Wintrow, D-Boise, read a letter from a constituent pleading with lawmakers to reject the bill.""'I cannot imagine if that right was taken away from us. Please do not take away a lifeline for parents to save their child,’” Wintrow said as she read the letter on the Senate floor. ”‘It is okay for people to disagree but please do not take away that lifeline.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848615,"Pepi lifts US over El Salvador 1-0, to Nations League semis","ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — Dropped by coach Gregg Berhalter from the U.S. World Cup roster, Ricardo Pepi returned to the national team under interim boss Anthony Hudson and responded with three goals in two games.Pepi scored on his first touches of the match in the 62nd minute, lifting the U.S. over El Salvador 1-0 on Tuesday night and into the CONCACAF Nations League semifinals.“It's been a roller coaster,” Pepi said.The 13th-ranked U.S. (3 wins, 1 draw) is unbeaten against No. 32 El Salvador (1 win, 1 loss, 2 draws) in 22 matches since 1992, its longest streak against any opponent and a run that includes 17 wins. The Americans joined Mexico in the Nations League semifinals at Las Vegas on June 15, part of a final four that will include Canada or Honduras along with Costa Rica or Panama.El Salvador, which needed a win to advance, has lost four straight matches and is winless in six.Pepi replaced Daryl Dike in the 60th minute and ran onto a pass Weston McKennie released at the midfield stripe. The 20-year-old striker, who scored twice in Friday's 7-1 rout at Grenada, took a touch, fought off an arm from defender Roberto Domínguez and chipped the ball with his right foot over goalkeeper Mario González for his sixth goal in 14 international appearances.At 20 years, 77 days, Pepi became the third-fastest American to score six goals behind Christian Pulisic (18 years, 263 days) and Jozy Altidore (19 years, 146 days), according to Opta.“Really pleased with him, for him,” Hudson said. “We really value him. We love him as a person, as a character. We believe in him. ... In both games he could have had quite a few more goals. He's had a lot of chances.”Gio Reyna got his second straight start in his return to the team after his family feuded publicly with Berhalter, who used the 20-year-old sparingly at the World Cup and nearly sent him home early because of lack of hustle in training.“He clearly has talent and you see tonight some of the things he does,” Hudson said. “He probably needs a few more games under his belt. ... We're very, very pleased with how he's been this week in training.""The U.S. won consecutive matches for the first time since a December 2021 exhibition against Bosnia and Herzegovina, and a January 2022 qualifier against El Salvador.Hudson is likely to coach the team at least through this summer's CONCACAF Gold Cup. Berhalter remains a candidate to keep the job.El Salvador coach Hugo Pérez, who made 73 appearances for the American national team player from 1984-94, wouldn't say whether he was interested in coaching the U.S.“If I say yes or no, they’ll kill me in my country,” he said.After the final whistle, American goalkeeper Matt Turner televised a gender reveal of his second child by kicking a ball on the field that exploded with pink smoke.Hudson changed seven starters, inserting right back Sergiño Dest, central defenders Miles Robinson and Tim Ream, left back Antonee Robinson, midfielder Yunus Musah, and Alejandro Zendejas and Dike at forward.Miles Robinson played his first international match since the final World Cup qualifier last March 30 after recovering from a torn left Achilles with Atlanta sustained on May 7. Miles Robinson was the only player from Major League Soccer in the U.S. starting lineup, and he paired with Ream in central defense for the first time since the opening qualifier at El Salvador on Sept. 2, 2021.“You saw moments of the old Miles where he's just so dominant in one vs. one situations and reads plays well and he steps in at the right time,” Hudson said.Dike, who played for Orlando in 2020 and '21, made his first national team start since July 2021.McKennie was wide with a header in first-half stoppage time, and Reyna hit the near post from 15 yards in the first minute of the second half off a feed from Pulisic.___AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848616,Middleton leads short-handed Bucks past decimated Pistons,"DETROIT (AP) — Khris Middleton scored a season-high 34 points against the team that drafted him, and the Milwaukee Bucks beat the Detroit Pistons 126-117 without Giannis Antetokounmpo on Monday night.“With Giannis out, I knew I had to be aggressive,” said Middleton, who added eight rebounds and five assists. “I had to get to my spots and when I got there, I've either got to shoot or find the open man.”Milwaukee improved to an NBA-best 54-21 despite the absences of Antetokounmpo (knee), Jrue Holiday (personal) and Jae Crowder (calf). Goran Dragic made his Bucks debut after signing with the team on March 4, but didn't score in nine minutes.“Chris has looked really good since he came back from the injury,” Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. “He's obviously going to be shooting it, but he's doing a lot of good things defensively right now.”Brook Lopez had 24 points and 14 rebounds, Bobby Portis added 21 points and 14 rebounds, and Jevon Carter scored 22.“I was really out there trying to crash the boards,” Portis said. “Even when you get blocked out, and I got blocked out a lot tonight, you might help free up someone else. It's just about playing with energy.”The Pistons got a career-high 32 points, eight rebounds and eight assists from rookie Jaden Ivey, but lost their sixth straight game and 17th of 18. They are 1-13 against Central Division opponents.“We know Jaden is going to be able to score the ball, but I'm happy with all the other things he's doing,” Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. “He's growing as a player, especially on the defensive end.”Detroit continued to use a roster that would fit in the Summer League, with Bojan Bogdanovic (achilles), Cade Cunningham (leg), Hamadou Diallo (ankle), Isaiah Stewart (shoulder) and Alec Burks (foot) all sidelined.The Pistons were within 117-110 when Middleton missed a jumper with 2:09 to play. However, Lopez tipped in the rebound, and after Ivey missed a 3-pointer, Middleton's three-point play made it a 12-point game.Milwaukee led 55-40 with three minutes left in the second quarter, but the Pistons narrowed the gap to 57-51 at halftime. Middleton had 17 points against his former team while Ivey scored 11 for Detroit.The Bucks led 94-90 at the end of the third, but Joe Ingles was called for a technical foul between quarters and Cory Joseph hit the free throw to make it a three-point game.The Bucks moved back in front 106-95, but Lopez missed the free throw on a possible three-point play with 8:43 to go. Detroit had several 3-pointers go in and out, and Carter hit a 3 to make it 111-97 with 6:48 left.“They are a great team and they know what it takes to win a game like that,” Ivey said. “They were doing all the little things and we didn't.”TIP-INSBucks: Middleton was selected by the Pistons in the second round (No. 39 overall) of the 2012 draft and played 27 games as a rookie. After the season, he was traded to Milwaukee along with Brandon Knight and Viacheslav Kravtsov for Brandon Jennings.Pistons: Detroit plays five of its final seven games on the road. The team's only remaining home games are on back-to-back nights — April 4 against Miami and April 5 against Brooklyn. ... The Pistons lost all four games to Milwaukee this season.CLEANING THE GLASSDespite rotating three post players — Marvin Bagley III, Jalen Duren and James Wiseman — the Pistons were only successful on 69% of their defensive rebounding chances, marking the ninth time in 10 games they have been under 75%.“We can't keep letting teams extend possessions,” Ivey said. “We've got to find a way to grab the defensive rebounds and turn them into transition points.”UP NEXTBucks: Visit the Indiana Pacers on Wednesday.Pistons: Visit the Oklahoma City Thunder on Wednesday.___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/28,,World

The technical came with 7:51 remaining in the third quarter of a 110-104 loss when Doncic argued a no-call after missing a shot on a drive to the basket. Crew chief Kevin Scott said in a pool report after the game that Doncic used “a profanity directed at the officials in protest to a no-call that was correctly judged in postgame video review.”TIMBERWOLVES 119, KINGS 115SACRAMENTO, Calif.

But with this victory they sit more securely in the fourth spot in the Western Conference playoff race — which would give them home-court advantage in the first round.Lauri Markkanen scored 25 points for Utah, but shot 6 for 22.

I hope to celebrate this award with all the filmmakers I have worked with. This award is a tribute to all of them as well,” Leung said, per the Hollywood Reporter. Leung is best known in Taiwan for his role in the 1989 Taiwanese film “A City of Sadness,” directed by Taiwan new wave cinema pioneer Hou Hsiao-hsien (侯孝賢).The film premiered at the Venice festival 33 years ago and became the first Taiwanese and Chinese language film to take home the festival’s top prize, the Golden Lion award. A digitally restored edition of “A City of Sadness” is currently being shown in nearly 60 theaters across Taiwan in celebration of the film’s success and legacy.“A City of Sadness” depicts the violence and terror of the 228 Massacre in 1947, in which between 18,000 and 28,000 Taiwanese were killed by Kuomintang (KMT) forces, and the massive changes to life in Taiwan after Japan relinquished control.Leung was recommended for the award by director Alberto Barbera, who said that he had ”achieved a unique profile as a pan-Asian and global star confirming his presence within ever-shifting screen cultures, deconstructing the traditional idea of male stardom and bringing compelling sensitivity to all his roles.”Leung has also starred in several films by acclaimed Hong Kong director Wong Kar Wai (王家衛), including “In the Mood for Love” and “Chungking Express.” He is one of two of this year's recipients of the Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement award, the other being Liliana Cavani, a leading director of the New Italian Cinema movement.Previous recipients of the award include Steven Spielberg, Robert De Niro, Ann Hui (許鞍華), John Woo (吳宇森), and David Lynch.",2023/03/28,545,Sports & Entertainment
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848620,Hunter admits to shooting baboon in north Taiwan,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A hunter admitted to police he had fatally shot an escaped baboon on Monday (March 27) and four other suspects are being investigated for their involvement.On Monday afternoon, an olive baboon which had been on the run in Taoyuan for 16 days was captured in a house on Zhongzheng Road in the Fugang area of Taoyuan City's Yangmei District with the use of a net. However, agricultural bureau personnel soon discovered that the primate had suffered a gunshot wound and despite undergoing emergency medical treatment, it soon died.Police then launched an investigation and summoned 13 people from the Taoyuan Department of Agriculture, Hsinchu County Department of Agriculture, and Leofoo Village Theme Park. On Tuesday morning (March 28), a hunter surnamed Lin (林) was sent to the Taoyuan District Prosecutor's Office to be investigated for violating the Wildlife Conservation Act (野生動物保育法), reported UDN.Lin inside Yangmei Precinct of Taoyuan Police Department on Monday. (Taoyuan Police Department photo)The Taoyuan Department of Agriculture alleges that Lin was not entrusted by the department to assist in the capture of the animal, and he was not authorized to shoot. Staff from Leofoo Village fired a tranquilizer dart at the monkey, but missed and did not know that it had already been shot with a firearm.After police questioned the 13 individuals involved in the capture of the monkey, Lin was listed as a suspect. One staff member each from the Taoyuan Department of Agriculture, the Hsinchu Department of Agriculture, and Leofoo Village, as well as another hunter, were listed as parties involved in the incident and were also sent to the prosecutor's office to be investigated for breaching the Wildlife Conservation Act.According to the police investigation, Lin is a legal hunter with a hunting rifle license and was contracted by the Hsinchu County Department of Agriculture. When the baboon was found to be hiding inside a house in Fugang, Lin and three agriculture department personnel entered the house first.(Taoyuan Police Department photo)At the time, the house was dark, and agriculture department staff had called on Lin to use a flashlight to search the home. However, the baboon reportedly rushed at Lin, prompting him to fire a shot that struck the animal's left chest and exited its back.The baboon began to bleed profusely and agriculture department personnel and Leofoo Village staff then entered the house. Fearing that the monkey would attack again, they fired a tranquilizer at it.They then used a net to seize the animal. After they removed it from the house, they discovered that it was badly bleeding. Department of Agriculture personnel rushed the baboon to the Leofoo Village for emergency treatment, but it succumbed to its wounds.(Taoyuan Police Department photo)Lin admitted to Yangmei Precinct police that he killed the baboon and told them he was a legally authorized hunter with a license to operate his hunting rifle. He said while he was out bird hunting in Hsinchu County's Hukou Township, he was asked by the Hsinchu County Department of Agriculture to assist with the capture of the baboon.He said he was concerned that the baboon might attack the people present and claimed that he only opened fire after receiving consent from the people present. However, Hsinchu County Department of Agriculture employees present denied that they issued this permission.Police confirmed that Lin is indeed a legally authorized hunter with a permit to use a hunting rifle. They said he was not commissioned by the Taoyuan Department of Agriculture to take part in the hunt for the baboon in Taoyuan City.(CNA photo)Since the staff from the Taoyuan Department of Agriculture, Hsinchu Department of Agriculture, Leofoo Village, and Lin all have differing accounts, police will conduct a more in-depth investigation.",2023/03/28,2646,Society

Almost 80% of the rescue lending was made between 2016 and 2021, mainly to middle-income countries including Argentina, Mongolia and Pakistan, according to the report by researchers from the World Bank, Harvard Kennedy School, AidData and the Kiel Institute for the World Economy.
China has lent hundreds of billions of dollars to build infrastructure in developing countries, but lending has tailed off since 2016 as many projects have failed to pay the expected financial dividends.
""Beijing is ultimately trying to rescue its own banks. That's why it has gotten into the risky business of international bailout lending,"" said Carmen Reinhart, a former World Bank chief economist and one of the study's authors.
Chinese loans to countries in debt distress soared from less than 5% of its overseas lending portfolio in 2010 to 60% in 2022, the study found.
Argentina received the most, with $111.8 billion, followed Pakistan on $48.5 billion and Egypt with $15.6 billion. Nine countries received less than $1 billion.
People's Bank of China (PBOC) swap lines accounted for $170 billion of the rescue financing, including in Suriname, Sri Lanka and Egypt. Bridge loans or balance of payments support by Chinese state-owned banks was $70 billion. Rollovers of both kinds of loan were $140 billion.
The study was critical of some central banks potentially using the PBOC swap lines to artifically pump up their foreign exchange reserve figures.
China's rescue lending is ""opaque and uncoordinated,"" said Brad Parks, one of the report's authors, and director of AidData, a research lab at William & Mary College in the United States.
The bailout loans are mainly concentrated in the middle income countries that make up four-fifths of its lending, due to the risk they pose to Chinese banks' balance sheets, whereas low income countries are offered grace periods and maturity extensions, the report said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848655,Brady Tkachuk leads Senators to 5-2 win over Panthers,"OTTAWA, Ontario (AP) — Brady Tkachuk had a goal and an assist, Mads Sogaard stopped 32 shots and the Ottawa Senators beat the Florida Panthers 5-2 on Monday night.Alex DeBrincat, Tim Stützle, Erik Brannstrom and Shane Pinto also scored for the Senators, who won for just the third time in 10 games (3-6-1).“I thought we played a good game, capitalized on our chances and got a big two points. We’ve got to keep the momentum going for the next couple of games,” DeBrincat said.Gustav Forsling scored twice for the Panthers in their fourth straight loss. Sergei Bobrovsky finished with 21 saves as Florida remained three points behind Pittsburgh for the second wild card in the Eastern Conference.Matthew Tkachuk was held without a point for the Panthers.“I think for the most part we were pretty good. It wasn’t a bad performance. We just got into some penalty trouble and they capitalized on their chances,” Matthew Tkachuk said. “I thought 5-on-5 we dominated, but special teams did not go in our favor.”The home crowd got into the action they broke into a “Brady’s better” chant on a couple of occasions.“To be honest I thought it was awesome,” Stützle said of the chant. “I think we have to give Matthew credit, too. I think he has 97 points, he’s an unreal player and he had some chances tonight too, but in the end I’ll for sure stick with Brady.”Brady Tkachuk got the Senators on the scoreboard first, getting a pass from Thomas Chabot and firing a slap shot past Bobrovsky for his 34th of the season 9:02 into the first period.Brannstrom made it 2-0 with 1:05 left in the opening period, picking up a loose puck in the right circle and firing it past Bobrovsky on a power play for his third.Forsling got the Panthers on the board 5:58 into the second, with a long one-timer from the left point past Sogaard.DeBrincat's one-timer from the left circle off a pass from Drake Batherson on a power play pushed the Senators' lead to 3-1 with 38 seconds left in the middle period. It was his 24th.Forsling got his second of the night and 12th of the season at 9:15 of the third to pull the Panthers back within one.However, Stützle scored Ottawa's third power-play goal of the night with 2:23 remaining for his 36th, and Pinto added an empty-netter less than a minute later to cap the scoring.“We took too many penalties and they really made us pay on their power play,” Forsling said. “We’ve been pretty good 5-on-5 but they have skilled guys on the power play and we took some stupid penalties.”BETTMAN EXPECTS SENATORS SALE THIS SUMMERNHL commissioner Gary Bettman met with Ottawa mayor Mark Sutcliffe and the National Capital Commission representatives before the game.Following his day at City Hall and reviewing the proposed site for a potential new downtown arena, Bettman met with the media at the Canadian Tire Centre and offered very little with regards to the sale of the NHL franchise, saying only that there are about half a dozen candidates still in the mix to purchase the club.He described the process for the sale of the franchise as “robust” and that the level of interest expressed has been “meaningful.” Bettman also said it should take about another six weeks to be finalized. He did add that midsummer is the likely time frame for final approval.“To make things crystal clear, and I’ve said this repeatedly, if the team is going to move, the only move that will be permitted is downtown,"" Bettman said. ""The Senators are not leaving Ottawa.”UP NEXTPanthers: At Toronto on Wednesday night in the second of a four-game trip.Senators: Host Philadelphia on Thursday night in the middle game of a three-game homestand.___AP NHL: https://www.apnews.com/hub/NHL and https://www.twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848656,Dan Snyder's future a hot topic at NFL owners meetings,"PHOENIX (AP) — Dan Snyder’s future in the NFL as owner of the Washington Commanders remains in standby mode while his peers gathered at a posh resort for the league’s annual meetings and waited for news on the potential sale of the team.A discussion on Snyder isn’t on the formal agenda this week, three people familiar with those details told The Associated Press on Monday. Still, Snyder was a hot topic of conversation despite his absence and even while quarterback Lamar Jackson’s trade request dominated headlines.“I think he’s put the team up for sale. I believe that something is close to happening,” New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft said. “I don’t know that for sure. We’ll wait and see what happens.”Canadian billionaire Steve Apostolopoulos recently joined groups led by Josh Harris and Tilman Fertitta to bid on purchasing the Commanders. Once Snyder accepts an offer, he must submit the bidder’s name to the NFL for approval. That hasn’t happened yet, a person told the AP.Last fall, with multiple investigations ongoing into the team’s workplace culture, finances and Snyder himself, he and wife Tanya hired a firm to “consider possible transactions.” Tanya continues to represent the team at league events.Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay has said there’s “merit to remove” Snyder as owner of the Commanders. That would take an unprecedented vote of 24 of the other 31 team owners to happen.Snyder and his attorneys have demanded that NFL owners and the league indemnify him against future legal liability and costs if he sells the team, a person told the AP. Two owners said they were angered by Snyder’s demand for indemnification but told the AP that they want to let the sale process play out before taking any action.Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said Snyder's situation has changed their relationship.“I think that it’s a little more formal, but I think it’s that way because of the various issues that are involved here,” Jones said. “It’s not ‘lovey-dovey,’ but it’s not really strained in any way.”Snyder and the team are still under investigation by former U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White, who was retained by the league to look into various aspects of the organization stemming from a congressional review into workplace misconduct that also included a referral to the Federal Trade Commission for potential business improprieties.A spokesperson declined to comment when asked if Snyder had refused to speak with White, saying it’s a confidential matter between the club and the league.Snyder is facing other civil suits and investigations.The Attorney General for the District of Columbia filed two suits in civil court against the Commanders late last year: one for a scheme to cheat fans out of ticket money and another naming Snyder, Commissioner Roger Goodell and the league, saying they colluded to deceive fans about an investigation into the team’s workplace culture that ended with a $10 million fine and no written report. The Commanders settled with the state of Maryland, agreeing to return security deposits to former season ticket holders and pay a $250,000 penalty.An investigation by the U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Reform, launched in October 2021 and including testimony from Snyder, Goodell and many others, said the team fostered a toxic workplace culture.Other news out of Monday's meetings included:LIFE-SAVING COALITIONThe NFL has launched The Smart Heart Sports Coalition, a collaboration among various organizations advocating to adopt evidence-based policies that will prevent fatal outcomes from sudden cardiac arrest among high school students.“The NFL has a history of stepping up on challenging issues,” league executive Anna Isaacson said. “Damar Hamlin’s life was saved. We want to save more lives.”The coalition includes the NFL, NBA, MLB, MLS, NHL, NCAA, the American Heart Association, American Red Cross, Korey Stringer Institute, National Athletic Trainers’ Association and Damar Hamlin’s Chasing M’s Foundation.League executive Jeff Miller said it’s critical for schools to have policies in place to deliver CPR effectively and have immediate access to AEDs.“If a school has an emergency-action plan in place, if they have somebody trained in CPR and they have access to an AED, a lot of the most tragic situations which unfortunately happen may be prevented.”FUTURE HOSTSLeague executive Peter O’Reilly said a vote on host cities for the Super Bowl in 2026 and the NFL draft in 2025 won’t take place this week. O’Reilly said it’s likely to be on the agenda for the May meetings.Las Vegas hosts the Super Bowl next year and New Orleans will host the following one. Kansas City hosts the NFL draft next month and Detroit will host next year.PRO BOWL GAMESO’Reilly said the reimagined Pro Bowl with a week of activities and competition capped by flag football is here to stay. He said 100% of players surveyed favor the new format. ___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848657,"Unbeaten Gamecocks, Iowa's Clark star in women's Final Four","SEATTLE (AP) — An undefeated South Carolina team led by star Aliyah Boston and guided by vaunted Dawn Staley, an Iowa squad that features high-scoring Caitlin Clark and the return of LSU and flashy coach Kim Mulkey headline the women's Final Four this weekend.Virginia Tech is the newcomer to the group as the Hokies are making their first appearance in the national semifinals. Hokies coach Kenny Brooks became the third Black male coach to take a team to the Final Four in women's basketball history.All of the women's basketball world will descend on Dallas this week as the Division I, II and III championships will be held there. It's only the second time that all three divisions will have their title games in the same place.Staley and the Gamecocks are looking to become the 10th team to go through a season unbeaten and the first to repeat as champions since UConn won four in a row from 2013-16. South Carolina advanced to its third consecutive national semifinals and fifth since 2015 thanks to another superb effort by Boston, the reigning AP Player of the Year. The three-time All-American had 22 points and 10 rebounds in a win over Maryland on Monday night.Next up for the Gamecocks is Iowa and the sensational Clark. She helped the Hawkeyes reach their first Final Four in 30 years with a game for the ages in the regional semifinals on Sunday night. The junior guard had the first 40-point triple-double in NCAA history in the win over Louisville.The Gamecocks have the experience edge having reached the Final Four so often with this group. No one on Iowa's roster was alive the last time the team advanced to the game's biggest stage. C. Vivian Stringer was the coach of that team in 1993 that reached the Final Four before losing to Ohio State in overtime.“It is like a storybook, but it’s kind of been like that for us all year long,” Iowa coach Lisa Bluder said. “I mean, we have had -- honestly, we keep talking about destiny and how it’s supposed to happen and it is happening. But I’m so happy for Caitlin. I can remember sitting in her living room and her saying, I want to go to a Final Four. And I’m saying, We can do it together. And she believed me. And so I’m very thankful for that.”The other game will pit LSU against Virginia Tech. The Tigers are making their first trip to the national semifinals since 2008 when Sylvia Fowles dominated the paint. Now LSU is led by another stellar post player in Angel Reese.She broke Fowles' record for double-doubles in a season earlier this year and was key in the Tigers win over Miami in the Elite Eight.Reese, who transferred in this season from Maryland, has made Mulkey's second season at the school a special one. She came to LSU with a resume headlined by three NCAA titles from her time at Baylor along with some flamboyant sideline looks such as her silver-shimmering jacket with white pants that she wore in the Elite Eight game Sunday.“What really makes me smile is not cutting that net down,” Mulkey said. “It’s looking around out there at all those LSU people, looking at that team I get to coach experience it for the first time.”LSU's opponent is also making its first appearance at the Final Four. The Hokies have had the best season in school history, winning the ACC crown as well under Brooks. He joined former Syracuse Quentin Hillsman and Cheyney State's Winthrop “Windy” McGriff.The significance has not been lost on Brooks, who hopes he can inspire other Black male coaches to get more opportunities.The Hokies run to the national semifinals has been led by star post Elizabeth Kitley and sharpshooter Georgia Amoore. The pair combined for 49 points in the win over Ohio State in the Elite Eight.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848658,Guardians' McKenzie could miss 2 months with shoulder strain,"Cleveland Guardians starter Triston McKenzie could be sidelined for two months with a shoulder strain, an early blow to the defending AL Central champions.The team said Monday night an MRI in Goodyear, Arizona, revealed a strain of his right teres major muscle (back of the shoulder). McKenzie will be shut down from throwing for two weeks and then re-evaluated.The Guardians estimated it will be eight weeks before he's back.McKenzie was scheduled to start Cleveland's second game in Seattle on Saturday. Now, manager Terry Francona will be forced to juggle his rotation in the first week, hardly an ideal way to begin the season.McKenzie was removed from an exhibition start Sunday against the Cincinnati Reds after one inning when he felt tightness in his right triceps. He later described it as “a weird sensation.”The 25-year-old McKenzie went 11-11 with a 2.96 ERA in 31 games last season, helping the Guardians pull away in their division. The right-hander struck out 190 in 191 1/3 innings. He's 18-21 with a 3.64 ERA in 60 starts over three seasons.McKenzie missed the 2019 season with a strained muscle in his right rotator cuff while in the minor leagues.With McKenzie going on the injured list, the Guardians are likely to recall either Xzavion Curry or Konnor Pilkington from Triple-A Columbus. Both made their major league debuts with Cleveland in 2022.___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848659,Pezzetta scores shootout winner; Canadiens beat Sabres 4-3,"BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) — Brendan Gallagher and the Montreal Canadiens rallied back to avoid playoff elimination with less than three weeks left in their season. The Buffalo Sabres, meanwhile, are running out of chances to stay in the Eastern Conference wild-card hunt.Gallagher forced overtime by scoring his 200th career goal, and Michael Pezzetta scored the decisive shootout goal in a 4-3 win over the Sabres on Monday night.“It’s one of those things I think we earned that chance. We weren’t fantastic but we did enough on the road tonight to get a win,” Gallagher said. ""Smiles all around.”The Canadiens could laugh, especially after Pezzetta celebrated his goal by putting his stick between his legs and riding it like a wooden horse -- much like former NHL tough guy Dave “Tiger” Williams did during his 14-year NHL career spanning the 1970s and 80s.“I’m not sure we’ll see that again. One of a kind,” said Gallagher. “I’d be worried about falling over.""Pezzetta scored by driving in from the right circle to beat Eric Comrie inside the far post. Buffalo’s Jack Quinn scored in the fourth shootout round, but was matched by Montreal’s Jesse Ylonen, whose shot from in tight managed to trickle in through Comrie.Jordan Harris and Alex Belzile also scored for Montreal, and Jake Allen stopped 30 shots through overtime, while allowing one goal on six shootout attempts.Montreal would have been eliminated from playoff contention for a second straight season — and two years removed from reaching the Stanley Cup Final — with any type of loss.The Sabres squandered a 3-2 third-period lead to drop to 3-6-3 in their past 12. Buffalo also blew a chance to move to within four points of idle Pittsburgh, which holds the eighth and final playoff spot.“Just a little hesitation,” forward JJ Peterka said of the Sabres third-period lapse. “We didn’t play with much energy and we didn’t play that aggressive as we played the two periods before. I think that was the difference.”Buffalo's Lukas Rousek scored a goal and added an assist while filling in for leading scorer Tage Thompson, who did not play due to an upper body injury. Peterka and defenseman Riley Stillman also scored, and Comrie stopped 38 shots through overtime, and allowed two goals on six shootout attempts.Montreal blew two one-goal leads to fall behind 3-2 on Stillman’s goal at the 8:31 mark of the second period.Gallagher scored on the fly by using Sabres defenseman Rasmus Dahlin as a screen to snap in a shot inside the far left post. With the goal, Gallagher tied Bobby Rousseau for 24th on the Canadiens career scoring list.“I liked the way we corrected ourselves, it’s a sign of maturity, in the way we stayed on task,” Canadiens coach Martin St. Louis said, in recalling how the Canadiens recently unraveled in an 8-4 loss two weeks ago to Colorado, which plays a similar up-tempo style as Buffalo.PRIDE NIGHTThe Sabres hosted their third Pride Night, with Russian D Ilya Lyubushkin electing not to participate in warmups by citing an anti-gay Kremlin law and fears of retribution at home in Moscow, where he has family and visits in the offseason. The remainder of the team wore dark blue jerseys with the Sabres logo on the front encircled by a rainbow-colored outline.During the first intermission, the Sabres broadcast a video in which GM Kevyn Adams said: “This is about recognizing someone’s humanity and true identity. We know there are people out there struggling with who they are, and we want them to know that they have an ally in the Buffalo Sabres.”UP NEXTCanadiens: At the Philadelphia Flyers on Tuesday night.Sabres: Host the New York Rangers on Friday night. ___ AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848660,Quickley scores 40 in place of Brunson; Knicks beat Rockets,"NEW YORK (AP) — Immanuel Quickley scored a career-high 40 points and Julius Randle had 26 as the New York Knicks snapped a three-game losing streak with a 137-115 victory over the Houston Rockets on Monday night.RJ Barrett added 19 points, Obi Toppin had 15 and Quinten Grimes scored 14 for the Knicks.Quickley connected on 14 of 18 shots from the field and added nine assists as the Knicks recorded a season-high 35 assists. He started in place of Jalen Brunson, who missed his second straight game with a bruised right hand.“When I know I’m starting, I try to get everyone involved early and make sure everyone has a feel for the game offensively,” Quickley said. “Everyone has to pick it up when one of your best players is out.”Kevin Porter Jr. led the Rockets with 26 points. Jalen Green had 19 and Kenyon Martin Jr. added 18 as Houston dropped its sixth straight game.Randle scored 15 points as the Knicks led 36-33 after the first quarter. His slam gave New York a 23-22 lead and they never trailed again.New York took its first double-digit lead, 49-39, on Josh Hart’s drive with 7:37 remaining in the second quarter.Houston went on a 10-0 run to tie the game, but a Quickley 3-pointer ignited a 12-5 run by the Knicks and New York went on to lead 66-61 at halftime.“I don’t know what he (Quickley) is, other than a good basketball player,” Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said. “If you need scoring, he can score. If you need playmaking, he had nine assists. He’s effective starting. He’s effective coming off the bench. You can play him at the point, at the two, at the three.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848663,Wild beat Kraken 5-1 behind Boldy's 2nd hat trick in 8 days,"ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — Matt Boldy had his second hat trick in the last five games for Minnesota, Marc-Andre Fleury made 35 saves, and the surging Wild beat the Seattle Kraken 5-1 on Monday night.Jake Middleton had a rare goal, Ryan Hartman scored late and Jared Spurgeon, Marcus Johansson and Joel Eriksson Ek each had two assists as the Wild stayed in first place in the Central Division. They took a one-point lead on Colorado into the day, with a critical road game against the Avalanche coming next. Dallas is three points behind.Boldy is a big reason why the Wild are in the lead, with 11 goals in the nine games they've played since superstar Kirill Kaprizov was sidelined by a lower-body injury. The Wild are 6-1-2 without Kaprizov, who's still 10th in the NHL with 39 goals.“It just works like that sometimes. I wish I had a better reason for you, but it just seems to be going in,” said Boldy, who is second on the team with 28 goals.Since the Wild entered the league in the 2000-01 season, only five NHL players have had more hat tricks at age 21 or younger than Boldy with three: Patrik Laine (eight), Marian Gaborik (five), Steven Stamkos (five), Alex DeBrincat (four) and Connor McDavid (four). Boldy, who turns 22 next week, had a hat trick in a 5-3 win over Washington here just eight days ago.“It looks like he’s trying to throw it through the net, which is great,” Wild coach Dean Evason said. “He has such a gifted shot.”Jaden Schwartz ended Fleury's shutout bid with 9 minutes left, scoring on a bouncing rebound that banked in off the goalie and into the net.“It didn’t feel like a 5-1 game. It felt closer than that,” Schwartz said. “Fleury made some big timely saves, and we just weren’t quite there for the second chances.”The Kraken, who wrapped up a four-game road swing with their first regulation loss on the trip, control the first wild card spot in the Western Conference. They lead Winnipeg by three points.Boldly flashed a wide grin when he notched the natural hat trick 50 seconds into the third period, prompting a shower of ballcaps onto the ice and an exit for Kraken goalie Philipp Grubauer.The fans were fired up for this potential preview of a first-round playoff series, chanting Fleury's name a few minutes later after a sliding pad save to deny another prime scoring opportunity.“It definitely feels good to win knowing we might see them again. I think right now it’s trying to get the most points and trying to get on top of our division,” Fleury said. “I think that’s the focus right now.”The Wild were outshot 36-20 by the Kraken and had only five on-target attempts in the first period. Middleton created a spark after Spurgeon faked a slap shot, passed the puck to his left and set up his blue-line partner for just his seventh career goal in 151 games in the NHL.Boldy brought a lagging power play to life with his first goal off the setup from Johansson, the first time the Wild scored on the man advantage in five games. They were on a 3-for-22 skid until then.Boldy, who has 17 points in 13 games this month since Johansson — the former Kraken left wing — was acquired in a trade with the Capitals and placed on his line, sneaked his second goal through traffic with 5:01 remaining in the second period.FLOWER POWERFleury is 4-1-1 against in two seasons against the Kraken. He beat them 1-0 in Seattle on Nov. 11. The 16-year veteran is also 8-0-1 in his last nine starts, with a 2.19 goals against average.“He saved us a little bit there at the start,” Eriksson Ek said. “I've said it before, but both our goaltenders have been really good, pretty much the whole season. It’s a nice thing to have, for sure.”UP NEXTKraken: Host Anaheim on Thursday night, starting a three-game homestand.Wild: Visit Colorado on Wednesday night, their first game in Denver this season.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848664,Kim wants N. Korea to make more nuclear material for bombs,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has called for his nuclear scientists to increase production of weapons-grade material to make bombs to put on his increasing range of weapons.North Korean photos of the meeting also showed what appeared to be a small new tactical warhead that was possibly designed to fit on a variety of delivery systems developed in recent years to overwhelm South Korean defenses.The report in state media Tuesday followed a series of missile launches — seven launch events in this month alone — and rising threats to use the weapons against his enemies. North Korea’s weapons tests and U.S.-South Korea military exercises have intensified in a tit-for-tat cycle, underscoring heightened tensions in the region.Officials say North Korea could further up the ante in coming weeks or months with more provocative displays of its military nuclear program, possibly including its first test detonation of a nuclear device since September 2017.The Korean Central News Agency said Kim, during a meeting on Monday with officials and scientists at a state nuclear weapons institute, stressed the need to ramp up bomb fuel production to meet his goals to expand his nuclear arsenal “exponentially,” and issued unspecified “important tasks” for his nuclear industry.Kim also examined the country’s established plans for nuclear counterattacks as scientists briefed him on the North’s latest nuclear-capable weapons systems and progress in technologies for mounting nuclear warheads on missiles, the agency said.The agency’s photos showed Kim talking with officials inside a hall that displayed what appeared to be various types of warheads, including around 10 khaki-green capsules with red tips. Other weapons included devices that looked like a black-and-white cone with fins or a large torpedo.A wall poster near one of the green devices described a warhead called “Hwasan-31,” based on the Korean word for volcano. The poster’s graphics implied that the weapon could fit on some of North Korea’s short-range ballistic systems, cruise missiles and a purported nuclear-capable underwater drone the country first unveiled last week. State media didn’t identify any of the devices in the photos.The size and shape of the Hwasan-31, which some experts estimated was around 50 centimeters (19 inches) wide and 90 centimeters (35 inches) long, suggested progress in North Korean efforts to create a miniaturized warhead that could fit on its delivery systems, said Kim Dong-yub, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul.Cheong Seong-Chang, an analyst at South Korea’s Sejong Institute, said the reports suggest North Korea is moving closer to its next nuclear test.Hours before North Korea’s sixth test in 2017, state media showed Kim Jong Un observing a silver, peanut-shaped device, which apparently was a purported thermonuclear weapon built for intercontinental ballistic missiles the North claimed to have detonated during that test.Cheong said the North will likely use its next test to claim it acquired a miniaturized nuclear warhead to mount on a growing range of weapons it describes as “tactical.” The North’s use of the term communicates a threat to proactively use them during conflicts to blunt the stronger conventional forces of South Korea and the United States.North Korea likely has dozens of nuclear warheads that can probably be fitted on some of its older systems, like Scuds or Rodong missiles.Lee Sung-jun, spokesperson of Seoul’s Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the South’s military was analyzing the warhead unveiled in the North Korean photos but didn’t provide specific assessments.Kim's calls for boosting bomb fuel production came days after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced plans to station tactical nuclear weapons in neighboring Belarus, in what was seen as a warning to the West as it increases military support for Ukraine.While aligning with Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, North Korea has stressed three-way cooperation with Moscow and Beijing to confront a “new Cold War” waged by “U.S. imperialists,” who it accuses of bringing the conflict to Asia by stepping up military activities with Seoul and Tokyo.A biennial South Korean defense document released in February said North Korea is estimated to have 70 kilograms (154 pounds) of weapons-grade plutonium, which some observers say is enough for about nine to 18 bombs. The document estimated that North Korea has “a considerable amount of” highly enriched uranium as well.North Korea’s main nuclear complex in Yongbyon has facilities to produce both plutonium and highly enriched uranium, the two main bomb fuels used to build nuclear weapons. North Korea is believed to be operating at least one additional covert uranium enrichment facility, in addition to the one at Yongbyon..In separate reports, KCNA said the North again detonated mock warheads during tests of nuclear-capable missiles and a purported underwater attack drone this week. The reports came a day after neighboring militaries detected the North firing two short-range ballistic missiles off its eastern coast.Monday’s launches came hours before a nuclear-powered U.S. aircraft carrier and its battle group engaged in joint training with South Korean warships in waters near Jeju island, in the allies’ latest show of strength. The USS Nimitz and the other warships pulled into the South Korean mainland port of Busan on Tuesday.The North’s official Rodong Sinmun newspaper on Tuesday published a commentary condemning the allies’ exercises and the U.S. deployment of the Nimitz strike group in the Korean Peninsula, insisting that the move “amounts to an open declaration of war.”KCNA said the missiles tested Monday were tipped with mock nuclear warheads that detonated as intended 500 meters (1,640 feet) above their sea targets. A front-line unit fired the missiles as part of an exercise familiarizing the troops with executing nuclear attack orders, the agency said.KCNA also said North Korea this week conducted another test of an underwater nuclear attack drone capable of setting off a “radioactive tsunami” to destroy enemy vessels and ports. Analysts, however, are skeptical whether such a device was a new threat, and South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said Monday it believes the North Korean claims regarding the weapon are likely “exaggerated or fabricated.”Still, the drone underlines Kim’s commitment to spur the expansion of his nuclear arsenal as he seeks to force the United States to accept the North as a legitimate nuclear power and negotiate economic concessions from a position of strength.North Korea already is coming off a record year in weapons testing, launching more than 70 missiles in 2022. It had set into law an escalatory nuclear doctrine that authorizes pre-emptive nuclear strikes in a broad range of scenarios where it may perceive its leadership as under threat.___Find more of AP's Asia-Pacific coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific",2023/03/28,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848667,Do Adani's woes matter for India's clean energy transition?,"BENGALURU, India (AP) — When the bidders for India's multibillion-dollar incentive to make solar components were announced in early March, the absence of corporate behemoth Adani Group was conspicuous.The group — which set up a gigantic factory to make solar equipment in 2016, more than tripled its capacity to make solar panels since 2017 and have begun making silicon materials needed to convert the sun rays to electricity — was expected to “bid in a large way,” said Chiranjeev Saluja, the managing director of Premier Energies, an Indian solar components manufacturer.The absence is another indication of the holding pattern the group has been in since U.S. short-selling firm Hindenburg Research alleged in late January that the businesses had engaged in fraud and stock price manipulation. Spooked investors dumped tens of billions of dollars in shares, while the company's purported proximity to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has dominated politics in past weeks.The group has a considerable stake in India's clean energy future: Adani’s renewable energy ambitions account for 10% of the country’s clean energy goals. But some analysts say the group's woes won’t hurt India’s energy transition, especially in the medium and long term. And with a big government-favored player like Adani forced to scale down, companies that were reluctant to bid for clean energy projects in India are likely to step up now, leading to a more competitive market and bigger investments in green energy in India, market watchers say.The Adani Group, led by founder Gautam Adani, influences the lives of millions in India. It builds roads and runs airports, operates some of its biggest ports, makes defense equipment, and sells cooking oil.More recently, the tycoon who made his fortune betting on coal in an energy-starved nation in the 1990s and remains the largest private developer of new fossil fuel projects in India, had set his eyes on becoming its biggest renewable energy player by 2030.The group has a clean energy portfolio of over 20 gigawatts of renewable energy, including 10 gigawatts of solar power, accounting for about 5% of clean energy nationwide. Its renewable energy portfolio is spread across 12 Indian states and includes one of the world’s largest solar power plants in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. Last September, Gautam Adani said the group would invest $70 billion in clean energy projects by 2032.What appears to have changed, at least in the short term, is the group's ability to raise funds for its ambitious expansion plans.Adani is still working on existing renewables projects but not those in the pipeline. France’s TotalEnergies paused a $4 billion investment plan to develop green hydrogen with the Adani Group. It's also not bid for any new projects since the Hindenburg report.But India's power minister R. K. Singh dismissed concerns in February that the stock for Adani's green companies along with the rest of his portfolio plummeting could affect the country's green ambitions in any way.Vinay Rustagi, managing director at the renewable energy consultancy Bridge to India, agrees that long-term effects will be minimal, but said there may be short-term hits. And there may be benefits to opening space for other companies, said Tim Buckley, director of Australia-based Climate Energy Finance who has been tracking the Adani Group’s growth for decades.Buckley said there are other Indian companies interested in investing in renewable energy and now there could be an acceleration of India’s transition to cleaner energy. India is the largest emitter of planet-warming gases behind China, the U.S. and the EU, and aims to produce 450 gigawatts of renewable energy by 2030. That would require that a little more than half of India's total installed capacity be clean by the end of the decade.But Adani Group's continuing interest in new fossil fuel projects put the Indian government under pressure to deliver a fossil fuel agenda and “less pressure to deliver on renewables,” said Buckley.“At the end of the day, it’s about removing the biggest single private developer of new fossil fuel projects in India, reducing their impact on the political system and democracy in India,” he said.The company has consistently aligned itself with India’s national priorities and was an early mover into sectors like hydrogen or storing power that were important for the government. Since the report, India’s opposition parties have demanded a probe into the company and questioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s proximity to Gautam Adani.Outside of the Adani Group, major Indian clean energy companies like Renew power, Tata power, Greenko energy holdings and the government-funded National Thermal Power Corporation are aggressively increasing their renewable energy capacity.Analysts say India’s renewables market is also attractive for foreign investors given the enormous potential for fast growth. The country needs to build 35 to 40 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity each year to meet its 2030 targets.With so many players keen to invest in India, Rustagi said any ripple effects of the Adani ordeal on the sector will “likely be temporary.”___Ghosal reported from New Delhi, India.___Follow Sibi Arasu on Twitter at @sibi123 and Aniruddha Ghosal at @aniruddhg1___Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848682,"Walt Disney Co begins 7,000 layoffs","LOS ANGELES, March 27(Reuters) - Walt Disney Co DIS.N on Monday began 7,000 layoffs announced earlier this year, as it seeks to control costs and create a more ""streamlined"" business, according to a letter Chief Executive Bob Iger sent to employees and seen by Reuters.Several major divisions of the company - Disney Entertainment, Disney Parks, Experiences and Products, and corporate - will be impacted, according to a person familiar with the matter. ESPN is not touched by this week's round of cuts, but is anticipated to be included in later rounds.The entertainment industry has undergone a retrenchment since its early euphoric embrace of video streaming, when established media companies lost billions as they launched competitors to Netflix Inc NFLX.O.They started to rein in spending when Netflix posted its first loss of subscribers in a decade in early 2022, and Wall Street began prioritizing profitability over subscriber growth.Iger said Disney would begin notifying the first group of employees who are impacted by the workforce reductions over the next four days. A second, larger round of job cuts will happen in April, ""with several thousand more staff reductions."" The final round will start before the beginning of the summer, the letter said.The Burbank entertainment conglomerate announced in February that it would eliminate 7,000 jobs as part of an effort to save $5.5 billion in costs and make its money-losing streaming business profitable.""The difficult reality of many colleagues and friends leaving Disney is not something we take lightly,"" Iger wrote, noting that many ""bring a lifelong passion for Disney"" to their work.Details of the layoffs had been closely guarded by the company, though insiders anticipated reductions would happen before Disney's annual shareholder meeting on April 3.Anxiety has been building within Disney, as rumors swirled about areas of possible cuts.""It’s a dark, black box,"" said one Disney executive who spoke to Reuters last week.Many had expected cuts to fall heavily on the Disney Media and Entertainment Division, which was eliminated in a corporate restructuring. The unit has been without a leader since the exit of Kareem Daniel in November, shortly after Iger returned as the company’s CEO.“It’s been a long time in the making,” said SVB MoffettNathanson analyst Michael Nathanson, adding that the company first began “to whisper” about the need to take out costs last fall, when Bob Chapek was still Disney’s chief executive.Josh D’Amaro, chair of Disney Parks, Experiences and Products, sent a memo to theme parks employees in February warning that the profitable division would experience cuts.Officials for two of the unions representing cast members at Walt Disney World Resorts in Orlando, Florida, said “guest-facing” services were not expected to be affected by the layoffs.""I don’t see where, when there are labor shortages in front-facing guest roles, it would be a good decision to lay off workers where the money train starts for the Walt Disney Co,"" said Paul Cox, president of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees Local 631.",2023/03/28,314,World
