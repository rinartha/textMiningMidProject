https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807700,"U.S. fighter jet shoots down unidentified, cylindrical object over Canada","WASHINGTON/OTTAWA, Feb 11 (Reuters) - A U.S. F-22 fighter jet shot down an unidentified cylindrical object over Canada on Saturday, the second such shootdown in as many days, as North America appeared on heightened alert following a week-long Chinese spying balloon saga that drew the global spotlight.
Canada Prime Minister Justin Trudeau first announced the shootdown over the Yukon territory in the country's north and said Canadian forces would recover and analyze the wreckage.
Canadian Defence Minister Anita Anand declined to speculate about the origin of the object, which she said was cylindrical in shape. She stopped short of describing it as a balloon but said it was smaller than the Chinese balloon shot down off South Carolina's coast a week ago, but similar in appearance. She said it was flying at 40,000 feet and posed a risk to civilian air traffic when it was shot down at 3:41 EST (2041 GMT).
""There is no reason to believe that the impact of the object in Canadian territory is of any public concern,"" Anand told a news conference.
The Pentagon said the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) detected the object over Alaska late Friday evening. U.S. fighter jets from Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska, monitored the object as it crossed over into Canadian airspace, where Canadian CF-18 and CP-140 aircraft joined the formation.
""A U.S. F-22 shot down the object in Canadian territory using an AIM 9X missile following close coordination between U.S. and Canadian authorities,"" Pentagon spokesman Brig. Gen. Patrick Ryder said in a statement.
U.S. President Joe Biden authorized the U.S. military to work with Canada to take down the high-altitude craft after a call between Biden and Trudeau, the Pentagon said. The White House said Biden and Trudeau agreed to continue close coordination to ""defend our airspace.""
""The leaders discussed the importance of recovering the object in order to determine more details on its purpose or origin,"" the White House said in a statement.
A day earlier, Biden ordered another shootdown of an unidentified flying object near Deadhorse, Alaska. The U.S. military on Saturday remained tight-lipped about what, if anything, it had learned as recovery efforts were underway on the Alaskan sea ice.
The Pentagon on Friday offered only a few details, including that the object was the size of a small car, it was flying at about 40,000 feet and could not maneuver and appeared to be unmanned. U.S. officials have been trying to learn about the object since it was first spotted on Thursday.
""We have no further details at this time about the object, including its capabilities, purpose, or origin,"" Northern Command said on Saturday.
It noted difficult arctic weather conditions, including wind chill, snow, and limited daylight that can hinder search and recovery efforts.
""Personnel will adjust recovery operations to maintain safety,"" Northern Command said.
On Feb. 4, a U.S. F-22 fighter jet brought down what the U.S. government called a Chinese surveillance balloon off the coast of South Carolina following its week-long journey across the United States and portions of Canada. China's government has said it was a civilian research vessel.
Some U.S. lawmakers criticized Biden for not shooting down the Chinese balloon sooner. The U.S. military had recommended waiting until it was over the ocean out of fear of injuries from falling debris.
U.S. personnel have been scouring the ocean to recover debris and the undercarriage of electronic gadgetry since the shootdown of the 200-foot-tall (60-meter-high) Chinese high-altitude surveillance balloon.
The Pentagon has said a significant amount of the balloon had already been recovered or located, suggesting American officials may soon have more information about any Chinese espionage capabilities aboard the vessel.
Sea conditions on Feb. 10 ""permitted dive and underwater unmanned vehicle (UUV) activities and the retrieval of additional debris from the sea floor,"" Northern Command said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807701,"Iran marks revolution anniversary, hackers interrupt state TV coverage","Feb 11 (Reuters) - The Islamic Republic marked the 44th anniversary of the Iranian revolution on Saturday with state-organised rallies, as anti-government hackers briefly interrupted a televised speech by President Ebrahim Raisi.
Raisi, whose hardline government faces one of the boldest challenges from young protesters calling for its ouster, appealed to the “deceived youth” to repent so they can be pardoned by Iran's supreme leader.
In that case, he told a crowd congregated at Tehran's expansive Azadi Square: “the Iranian people will embrace them with open arms”.
His live televised speech was interrupted on the internet for about a minute, with a logo appearing on the screen of a group of anti-Iranian government hackers that goes by the name of “Edalate Ali (Justice of Ali). A voice shouted “Death to the Islamic Republic.”
Nationwide protests swept Iran following the death in September of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in the custody of the country's morality police.
Security forces have responded with a deadly crackdown to the protests, among the strongest challenges to the Islamic Republic since the 1979 revolution ended 2,500 years of monarchy.
As part of an amnesty marking the revolution's anniversary, Iranian authorities on Friday released jailed dissident Farhad Meysami, who had been on a hunger strike, and Iranian-French academic Fariba Adelkhah.
On Sunday, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei issued an amnesty covering a large number of prisoners, including some arrested in recent anti-government protests.
Rights group HRANA said dozens of political prisoners and protesters, including several prominent figures, had been freed under the amnesty but that the exact conditions of their release were not known.
Rights activists have expressed concern on social media that many may have been forced to sign pledges not to repeat their ""offences"" before being released. The judiciary denied this on Friday.
HRANA said that as of Friday, 528 protesters had been killed, including 71 minors. It said 70 government security forces had also been killed. As many as 19,763 protesters are believed to have been arrested.
Iranian leaders and state media had for weeks appealed for a strong turnout at Saturday's rallies as a show of solidarity and popularity in an apparent response to the protests.
On the anniversary’s eve Friday night, state media showed fireworks as part of government-sponsored celebrations, and people chanting ""Allahu Akbar! (God is Greatest!)"". However, many could be heard shouting ""Death to the dictator!"" and “Death to the Islamic Republic” on videos posted on social media.
Reuters could not verify the social media posts independently.
Government television on Saturday aired live footage of the state rallies around the country.
In Tehran, domestic-made anti-ballistic missiles, a drone, an anti-submarine cruiser, and other military equipment were on display as part of the celebrations.
“People have realized that the enemy’s problem is not woman, life, or freedom,” Raisi said in a live televised speech at Tehran’s Azadi Square, referring to the protesters’ signature slogan.
“Rather, they want to take our independence,” he said.
His speech was frequently interrupted by chants of “Death to America” - a trademark slogan at state rallies. The crowd also chanted “Death to Israel.”
Raisi accused the “enemies” of promoting “the worst kind of vulgarity, which is homosexuality”.
Adelkhah, who had been in prison since 2019, was one of seven French nationals detained in Iran, a factor that has worsened relations between Paris and Tehran in recent months.
She was sentenced in 2020 to five years in prison on national security charges. She was moved to house arrest later but in January returned to jail. Adelkhah has denied the charges.
Meysami’s release came a week after supporters warned that he risked dying because of his hunger strike. He was arrested in 2018 for protesting against the compulsory wearing of the hijab. read more
In announcing Adelkhah’s release on Friday, the French foreign ministry called that her freedoms be restored, ""including returning to France if she wishes.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807702,France protests look to test government's resolve on pension reforms,"PARIS/TOURS, Feb 11 (Reuters) - Hundreds of thousands of people demonstrated across France on Saturday seeking to keep up pressure on the government over its pension reform plans, including a move to raise the retirement age to 64 from 62.
After three days of nationwide strikes since the start of the year, unions are hoping to match a mass turnout from Jan. 19 when more than a million people marched in opposition to the plans.
""If they're not able to listen to what's happening on the streets, and are not able to realise what is happening with the people, well they shouldn't be surprised that it blows up at some point,"" Delphine Maisonneuve, a 43-year-old nurse told Reuters as a protest in Paris kicked off.
The French spend the largest number of years in retirement among OECD countries - a benefit which, opinion polls show, a substantial majority of people are reluctant to give up.
President Emmanuel Macron says the reform is ""vital"" to ensuring the viability of the pension system.
The Interior Ministry said an estimated 963,000 people had attended demonstrations across the country. Paris police said some 93,000 people had marched in the capital, compared to 80,000 on Jan. 19. The unions put the Paris figure at 500,000.
In the central western city of Tours, 40-year-old fireman Anthony Chauveau told Reuters that opposing the reform was crucial because the difficulties of his job were simply not being taken into consideration.
""They are telling us that we will need to work two more years... our life expectancy is lower than the majority of workers,"" he said.
The peaceful protests in Paris were partly marred by some minor clashes. A car and some rubbish bins were set on fire and police forces used teargas and stun grenades in their attempt to disperse some of the more radical elements in the protests.
In a joint statement ahead of Saturday's marches all the main unions called for the government to withdraw the bill.
They warned that they would seek to bring France to a standstill from March 7 if their demands were not met. A strike is already scheduled for Feb. 16.
""If the government continues to remain deaf then the inter-union grouping will call for France to be shut down,"" they said ahead of Saturday's marches.
The protests are the first on a weekend, when workers do not need to strike or take time off.
They follow the first week of debate on the pension legislation in parliament.
The opposition has suggested thousands of amendments to complicate the debate and ultimately try to force the government to pass the bill without a parliamentary vote and through decree, a move that could potentially sour the rest of Macron's mandate.
He was re-elected in April 2022 for five years.
Raising the retirement age by two years and extending the pay-in period would yield an additional 17.7 billion euros ($19.18 billion) in annual pension contributions, allowing the system to break even by 2027, according to Labour Ministry estimates.
Unions say there are other ways to do this, such as taxing the super rich or asking employers or well-off pensioners to contribute more.
""Even though at my age, I'm not really affected (by the pension reforms), it's important to be vigilant about our society, that there is solidarity, that it's one where people are very close to one another, and to be vigilant about caring not only for our elderly but also for our children,"" said Kamel Amriou, 65, a retired graphic artist.PARIS/TOURS, Feb 11 (Reuters) - Hundreds of thousands of people demonstrated across France on Saturday seeking to keep up pressure on the government over its pension reform plans, including a move to raise the retirement age to 64 from 62.After three days of nationwide strikes since the start of the year, unions are hoping to match a mass turnout from Jan. 19 when more than a million people marched in opposition to the plans.""If they're not able to listen to what's happening on the streets, and are not able to realise what is happening with the people, well they shouldn't be surprised that it blows up at some point,"" Delphine Maisonneuve, a 43-year-old nurse told Reuters as a protest in Paris kicked off.The French spend the largest number of years in retirement among OECD countries - a benefit which, opinion polls show, a substantial majority of people are reluctant to give up.President Emmanuel Macron says the reform is ""vital"" to ensuring the viability of the pension system.The Interior Ministry said an estimated 963,000 people had attended demonstrations across the country.

            Aubrey Griffin added 18 points for the short-handed Huskies (22-4, 14-1 Big East), who were coming off back-to-back losses for the first time since 1993. They haven’t dropped three in a row since that same season.

            “Even when we got up 15, 16, it never seemed safe,” Connecticut coach Geno Auriemma said. “Nothing ever seems safe anymore. But we got a stop when we needed a stop. We got a bucket when we needed a bucket. We made some free throws. Finding a way to win sometimes is just as valuable as having somebody who can make shots.”











            Freshman Kennedy Fauntleroy had a game-high 24 points for the Hoyas (12-13, 5-11), who have lost 34 consecutive games to Connecticut.

            Connecticut dominated the glass, outrebounding the Hoyas 43-23 in a game played off campus at the Entertainment & Sports Arena, the home of the WNBA’s Washington Mystics.

            “That’s why they’re UConn,” Georgetown coach James Howard said. “They might not have all the pieces, but they have that size and that length. We still tried to go in there and tried to put a body on them, but some things we just missed on and they were able to capitalize.”

            The Huskies lost 81-77 on Sunday to No. 1 South Carolina, then followed it up Wednesday with a 59-52 setback at Marquette to leave the program in an unusual predicament.

            “I think it was a learning thing,” Griffin said. “We learned from it and we’re just going on to the next game. That’s what our mentality is.”

            In the first half, Georgetown threatened to deal Connecticut its third loss in seven days. The Hoyas held an early seven-point advantage, led 17-13 after a quarter and were within three points in the middle of the third quarter. 

            Connecticut finally created some separation with a 12-0 spurt spanning parts of the final two periods to push its advantage to 51-36. Griffin scored six points in the run, while Georgetown was held scoreless for nearly five minutes.

            The Hoyas pulled within 63-59 with 28.7 seconds remaining, but the Huskies made their last four free throws to seal the victory.

            Connecticut, which committed 23 turnovers in a 65-50 defeat of the Hoyas on Jan. 15, again struggled with Georgetown’s defense. The Huskies had 12 turnovers at halftime and 23 for the game.

            UConn guard Lou Lopez Sénéchal was limited to a season-low five points.

            “The way our team is constructed right now, all five players we put on the floor have to play really well every night in order for us to have the kind of success we’ve had leading up to these three games this week,” Auriemma said. “And we’re not getting that right now. We’re not getting the cohesiveness of five guys playing well and playing together and helping each other.”

            BIG PICTURE

            Connecticut: The Huskies maintained their Big East lead even though sophomore guards Caroline Ducharme (concussion) and Azzi Fudd (right knee) remained sidelined. Ducharme has missed 13 consecutive games and Fudd has sat out the last nine games. 

            Georgetown: The Hoyas haven’t defeated Connecticut since 1993, but they’ve clearly made year-over-year progress against the Big East power. Georgetown’s average margin of defeat in two losses to the Huskies last season was 43.5 points and dropped this year’s home-and-home by a total of 23 points.

            POLL IMPLICATIONS

            While Connecticut is near-certain to fall out of the top five after its loss at Marquette, the Huskies limited the damage to their ranking by handling the Hoyas.

They haven’t dropped three in a row since that same season.“Even when we got up 15, 16, it never seemed safe,” Connecticut coach Geno Auriemma said. “Nothing ever seems safe anymore. But we got a stop when we needed a stop. We got a bucket when we needed a bucket. We made some free throws. Finding a way to win sometimes is just as valuable as having somebody who can make shots.”Freshman Kennedy Fauntleroy had a game-high 24 points for the Hoyas (12-13, 5-11), who have lost 34 consecutive games to Connecticut.Connecticut dominated the glass, outrebounding the Hoyas 43-23 in a game played off campus at the Entertainment & Sports Arena, the home of the WNBA’s Washington Mystics.“That’s why they’re UConn,” Georgetown coach James Howard said. “They might not have all the pieces, but they have that size and that length. We still tried to go in there and tried to put a body on them, but some things we just missed on and they were able to capitalize.”The Huskies lost 81-77 on Sunday to No. 1 South Carolina, then followed it up Wednesday with a 59-52 setback at Marquette to leave the program in an unusual predicament.“I think it was a learning thing,” Griffin said. “We learned from it and we’re just going on to the next game.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807709,California 2024 US Senate contest kicks off at furious pace,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — California’s U.S. Senate race is unfolding at a furious pace, with candidates reporting seven-figure fundraising and holding competing rallies and campaign events more than a year before the 2024 primary election.

            The fight for the safely Democratic seat held by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who at 89 is the oldest member of Congress, is shaping up as a marquee match-up between nationally known rivals and is likely to become one of the most expensive Senate races in the country next year.

            On Saturday, Democratic U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff, who rose to prominence as the lead prosecutor in former President Donald Trump’s first impeachment trial, gathered hundreds of supporters in a union hall parking lot for a rally in his hometown of Burbank, California, where he implored the cheering crowd, “Let’s go win this thing.”











            Schiff, who announced his candidacy last month, said he was running for Senate after two decades in Congress “to build an economy that works for everyone, a democracy that will last for all time and a planet that doesn’t melt beneath our feet.”

            A day earlier, Democratic U.S. Rep. Katie Porter brought her Senate campaign to Los Angeles, where she met with local leaders to discuss pollution in lower-income neighborhoods. She said such areas are often overlooked in Washington and Sacramento, where residents' complaints about unhealthy conditions go unheard.

            Porter, a leader in Congress' progressive wing, built a reputation for her tough questioning of CEOs and other witnesses at congressional hearings — often using a whiteboard to break down information.

            Other potential contenders for the seat include Democratic Rep. Barbara Lee, a former chair of the Congressional Black Caucus. If she runs and is elected, Lee would be the only Black woman in the Senate.

            
                Feinstein has yet to say if she will seek a seventh term. In recent years, questions have arisen about her cognitive health and memory, though she has defended her effectiveness. However, her reticence about her future has created a publicly awkward dynamic — the race to replace her is rapidly taking shape, even as the senator remains unclear about her intentions.

            Schiff's rally, held on a nippy, mostly overcast morning, marked the start of a two-week statewide tour, with stops to include San Diego, Sacramento, Fresno and San Francisco. 

            He was joined by his wife Eve, one of his two children, Alexa, and David McMillan, whom the congressman mentored as a youth and considers part of his family. 

            After recounting his career as a federal prosecutor, state legislator and member of Congress, Schiff made clear he would anchor his campaign to his role as impeachment manager and Trump’s chief antagonist in Congress. He has been a frequent target of conservatives — Trump in particular — since the then-GOP-led House Intelligence Committee he served on started investigating Trump’s ties to Russia in the 2016 election.

            He mentioned “democracy” more than a half-dozen times in the speech. He's selling T-shirts and coffee mugs on his campaign website, with the slogan “Democracy Matters.” He called Trump, who has announced his 2024 campaign for the presidency, “a demagogue bent on destroying our democracy.”

            “We investigated Trump. We impeached him. We held him accountable and then we defeated him at the ballot box,” Schiff said to cheers. “And we will defeat him again, if the GOP is foolish enough to nominate him. He will never see the inside of the Oval Office, never again.”

            Trump was impeached in December 2019 on charges he abused the power of the presidency to investigate rival Joe Biden and obstructed Congress’ investigation. The Republican-led Senate acquitted Trump of both charges. In 2021, he became the first president in U.S. history to be impeached twice, this time for inciting the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol after he lost the 2020 election. He was again acquitted by the Senate.

            Schiff's other foundational issues include fighting climate change and improving the economy.

            “Too many people are working multiple jobs but cannot pay the rent, afford groceries or pay for lifesaving medication,” he said. “Too many children are growing up in poverty and hungry.”

            Schiff and Porter, both prolific small-dollar fundraisers, already are dueling over campaign dollars and endorsements. Former Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco is backing Schiff, providing Feinstein retires, and Porter is supported by Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren.

            Democrats are expected to dominate the contest in the famously liberal state — a Republican hasn’t won a statewide race in California since 2006, and the past two Senate elections had only Democrats on the November ballot.LOS ANGELES (AP) — California’s U.S. Senate race is unfolding at a furious pace, with candidates reporting seven-figure fundraising and holding competing rallies and campaign events more than a year before the 2024 primary election.The fight for the safely Democratic seat held by Sen.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807731,Bolsonaro says he may return to Brazil in the coming weeks,"BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) — Former President Jair Bolsonaro said Saturday he intends to return to Brazil “in the following weeks.” 

            The comment during an event at an evangelical church in Florida was the first time that Bolsonaro has made a statement in public about returning home.

            The far-right politician has been in the U.S. since arriving in Orlando, Florida, on Dec. 31, the eve of the inauguration of his leftist rival, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, as Brazil's current president. 











            Saturday's event was held entirely in Portuguese for a Brazilian crowd of Bolsonaro supporters living abroad and was organized by the right-wing organization Yes Brazil USA. Bolsonaro was cheered throughout the event.

            There has been speculation during recent weeks on when Bolsonaro might return to Brazil, where is the subject of several investigations into possible wrongdoing. 

            He initially entered the U.S. on a one-month diplomatic visa, which ended Jan. 31. He was accompanied by a team of presidential advisers and his wife, all of whom left Florida last month. 

            Lawyers for Bolsonaro told Brazilian media recently that they applied for a tourist visa to extend his stay in the U.S. 

            Amid the speculation about Bolsonaro's plans, one of his sons, Sen. Flavio Bolsonaro, told Brazilian reporters that he didn’t know when his father would return. “It could be tomorrow, it could be in six months, he might never return. I don’t know. He’s relaxing,” the son said.

            For the first time in his more than three-decade political career as a lawmaker and then as president, Bolsonaro no longer enjoys the special legal protection that requires any trial be held at the Supreme Court.

            Bolsonaro is being investigated in four inquiries, which had been in the Supreme Court and were sent to trial court this past week. 

            Among the inquiries is whether Bolsonaro had any role in inciting the Jan. 8 riot by his supporters who stormed into government buildings in the capital, Brasilia, demanding his election defeat to Lula be overturned. 

            Investigators are also looking into who organized and financed the mass gathering of Bolsonaro supporters, who came to the capital from all over Brazil.

             One of the investigations held by the Brazilian justice is who are the ones responsible for inciting the crimes, as well as who financed people from all over the country to travel to Brasilia.BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) — Former President Jair Bolsonaro said Saturday he intends to return to Brazil “in the following weeks.”The comment during an event at an evangelical church in Florida was the first time that Bolsonaro has made a statement in public about returning home.The far-right politician has been in the U.S. since arriving in Orlando, Florida, on Dec. 31, the eve of the inauguration of his leftist rival, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, as Brazil's current president.Saturday's event was held entirely in Portuguese for a Brazilian crowd of Bolsonaro supporters living abroad and was organized by the right-wing organization Yes Brazil USA.

            Alex Ducas added 18 points and six rebounds for the Gaels (22-5, 11-1 West Coast Conference) and Aidan Mahaney contributed 10 points and five assists.

            Kristian Sjolund led the Pilots (13-15, 5-8) with 12 points, and Juan Gorosito and Tyler Robinson each added 10 points.











            The Gaels took a 39-38 lead into halftime after a back-and-forth first half. They began the second half on a 16-0 run to blow the game open and never trailed again.

            “Sometimes, you’ve got to make shots,” Saint Mary’s head coach Randy Bennett said of the second-half turnaround. “We came out and banged a few threes, separated, gave us a little wiggle room. You don’t feel like every possession is for the game.”

            Johnson took advantage of vulnerabilities in the Pilots’ defense to take over on offense, while the Gaels’ defense improved.

            “We started playing our brand of basketball,” Johnson said. “Started getting stops, consecutive stops, rebounding, not allowing offensive boards. When we do that, when we play to our strengths, there’s not a lot of teams that can have the capacity to keep going and keep trying to attack that. It gets frustrating and you start to see it on their faces.”

            Saint Mary’s was fueled in its run by hot 3-point shooting, going 15 of 32 (46.9%) from beyond the arc and outrebounded Portland 41-22.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807747,Scan on LeBron James' sore left foot shows no serious damage,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A scan done on LeBron James' troublesome left ankle and foot showed no serious issue, but the newly crowned NBA career scoring leader sat out a second straight game Saturday night since breaking Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's mark earlier in the week.

            Still, coach Darvin Ham expects to see James back on the floor before the All-Star break. When asked whether James might need to be sidelined through the break, Ham offered, ""No, I don't think he'll allow us to do that.""

            General manager Rob Pelinka said earlier Saturday that nothing was seriously wrong for James, who topped former Lakers star Abdul-Jabbar during Tuesday's 133-130 home loss to Oklahoma City. 











            “LeBron did have some imaging on his foot injury, and we’re grateful that things came back clean and good.” Pelinka said.

            The game with Golden State — missing reigning NBA Finals MVP Stephen Curry because of a left leg injury — marked James' seventh sidelined by soreness in the left ankle. He also missed one game with left foot soreness and another because of a non-COVID illness. He also sat out five games with a strained left inner thigh muscle.

            “Just for him to continue to get treatment, stay off of it,” Ham said of the plan. “Obviously we made moves and one of the biggest moves is making sure we’re not putting him in a position where we’re putting him at risk of a bigger issue.”

            James has what Ham called “normal wear and tear, little irritated in one area.”

            The 38-year-old James has made his 19th straight All-Star team and has 38,390 career points.

            “We’re just taking this time that we have to get him treated and hopefully get him back so we can make a good run and he can be in the midst of it down the stretch,” Ham said.

The large turnout makes this one of the biggest Matsu pilgrimages in Taiwan.The event began three days ago with a special flag raising ceremony, calling upon pilgrims to prepare themselves by commencing a vegetarian diet, according to PTS.Crowds began packing the area around Miaoli County’s Gong Tian Temple, creating a rowdy scene both inside and outside of the temple as devotees were eager to accompany Baishatun Matsu’s distinctive “pink sedan chair” before it departed.Vice President Lai Ching-te pays a visit before the pilgrimage begins. (CNA photo)Signifying the importance of this pilgrimage, President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) and Vice President Lai Ching-te (賴清德) both visited Gong Tian Temple, offering incense and praying for blessings a day earlier on Saturday (Feb. 11).Going a step further, or perhaps many steps, was former Taipei Mayor and current Taiwan People's Party Chair Ko Wen-je (柯文哲), who has signed up to participate in the entire nine-day, eight-night pilgrimage, according to UDN.

When Matsu’s sedan chair ultimately set off at 1:25 a.m., there was great excitement amplified by the sound of gongs and fireworks. With that, tens of thousands joined the procession from the temple.Along the way, many devotees kneeled on the ground, expressing their devotion to the deity.Gong Tian Temple authorities continue to encourage pilgrims to wear face masks during the event and observe social distancing when possible. Also, devotees should take precautions regarding weather as the temperature difference between night and day can be quite large.113,000 sign up for Baishatun Matsu Pilgimage. (CNA photo)The Baishtun Matsu Pilgrimage has a history of approximately 200 years. The date when the pilgrimage begins is determined by tossing “moon blocks.”Another important feature of the pilgrimage is the unpredictability of the route, which is not fixed, but instead led by Matsu’s sedan chair.The only fixed points on the itinerary are the departure and return from Gong Tian Temple, and the arrival at Beigang’s Chao Tian Temple, which is estimated to be on Friday (Feb. 17). The conclusion of the pilgrimage is estimated to be around 4:00 p.m. on Feb. 20.",2023/02/12,943,Culture

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807767,Scheffler holds WM Phoenix Open lead in bid to repeat,"SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) — Scottie Scheffler held onto the lead Saturday at the WM Phoenix Open in a bid to successfully defend his title and regain the No. 1 spot in the world.

            The second-ranked Scheffler shot a 3-under 68 in front of some 200,000 fans — including WNBA star Brittney Griner — at TPC Scottsdale to get to 13 under, two strokes ahead of third-ranked Jon Rahm and Nick Taylor.

            “Something I talked about at the beginning of the week was I felt like I’ve been on the outside looking in on Sundays,” Scheffler said. “To be in the final group with a two-shot lead, I believe, is definitely a position I want to be in. I’m looking forward to tomorrow.”











            Rahm also had a 68, holing a curling 40-footer for birdie on the stadium 16th for his third birdie in four holes.

            “A couple of swings that weren’t that bad put me in some bad situations,” Rahm said. “I was able to scramble really well.”

            Griner watched the action on rowdy 16th. The Phoenix Mercury center is spending time at home to recover from her time in a Russian jail. She was traded in a dramatic prisoner swap in December.

            Taylor shot 67.

            “It’s fun being in this environment,” Taylor said. “I think if you’re not having fun, you probably shouldn’t be doing what we’re doing. It’s a lot of fun.”

            Scheffler would take the No. 1 spot from Rory McIlroy — tied for 28th at 3 under after a 70 — with a victory, as long as McIlroy finishes worse than solo third. Scheffler also could get to No. 1 by finishing solo second if McIlroy is 36th or worse and Rahm doesn't win.

            Rahm, the former Arizona State star from Spain, would go to No. 1 with a victory if McIlroy finishes worse than a three-way tie for second, or by finishing solo second if McIlroy finishes worse than solo 47th and Scheffler doesn’t win.

            Jordan Spieth and Adam Hadwin were 10 under.

            Speith had the best score in the delayed second round, finishing off a 63 in the morning. He added a 69 in the third round, highlighted by a 77-yard bunker shot to 3 feet to set up a birdie on the par-4 17th.

            “I could drop a bucket of balls and not hit another one inside of 10 feet,” Spieth said. “I feel like a strength of my game is those kind of in-between bunker shots that are normally some of the most challenging shots in golf. For whatever reason I just feel comfortable in the uncomfortable in those kind of situations.”

            Hadwin had a 71, playing in the final group with Scheffler and Rahm. He hit to 1 1/2 feet for birdie on the 16th, the closest of the round on the par-3 hole on the final tee shot of the day. 

            In the morning, Hadwin — on the 11th green Friday when second-round play was suspended because of darkness — finished off his second straight 66 for a share of the lead with Scheffler at 10 under.

            Last year, Scheffler beat Patrick Cantlay in a playoff for his first PGA Tour title. Scheffler added victories in the Arnold Palmer Invitational, WGC-Match Play and Masters and was the PGA Tour’s player of the year.

            The 26-year-old Texan followed a bogey on the par-5 13th — his first bogey since his fourth hole Thursday — with a birdie on the par-4 14th, hitting a 5-iron shot 210 yards to 4 feet. He also birdied the 17h.

            “Feel good,” Scheffler said. “I didn’t hit it as well today as I hoped to. But still got around in 3 under. Kept the ball in play for the most part. Just kept plugging along. Only one bogey was good today.”

            He went to the driving range after the round.

            “I just wanted to hit a couple drivers, a couple irons,” Scheffler said. “Nothing specific. I hit about five balls and five putts and came back here.”

            Rahm opened the year with consecutive victories in the Sentry Tournament of Champions and The American Express.

            “Hopefully, tomorrow I can get off a better start, play a good front nine and go into that back nine with a solid chance of getting it done,” Rahm said.

            Rickie Fowler, the 2019 winner, had a 67 to join Tyrrell Hatton (67), Sungjae Im (67), Jason Day (68) and Xander Schauffele (70) at 9 under. Schauffele bogeyed Nos. 15 and 16.

            “Just managing our way around,” Fowler said. “Obviously, I know I can play well at this place. Love the atmosphere. Love the fans. So, trying to draw from them as much as I can.”

            Bryce Thompson added 12 points for the Cowboys (16-9, 7-5 Big 12) in their fifth straight win.

            “Credit to these kids for sticking with the defensive game plan,” Oklahoma State coach Mike Boynton said. “And then we did the job in the second half rebounding, to limit their second-shot opportunities.”











            Aljaz Kunc scored 13 for Iowa State (16-8, 7-5), which shot 35% from the floor and went 9 for 19 at the free throw line.

            “That's not how we normally play,” said Cyclone guard Tamin Lipsey, who finished with 12 points and six rebounds. “We like to be the aggressors. They did a good job of doing that.”

            The Cyclones led 32-26 at the break and were ahead 35-28 early in the second half before Oklahoma State caught up.

            Wright's jumper put the Cowboys ahead for good at 52-50. Caleb Asberry followed with a 3 to boost the lead with 4:38 remaining.

            “Our problems started far sooner than down the stretch,” Iowa State coach T.J. Otzelberger said. “Felt like today our mental toughness wasn't very good.”

            BIG PICTURE

            Iowa State needed a win to stay within a game of Big 12 leader Texas, but instead remained in a funk.

            The Cowboys have bounced back after starting 1-4 in conference play.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807769,Embiid leads 76ers over Nets in Harden's return to Brooklyn,"NEW YORK (AP) — Joel Embiid had 37 points and 13 rebounds, James Harden scored 29 points in his first game in Brooklyn since being traded a year ago to begin a Big Three breakup, and the Philadelphia 76ers beat the Nets 101-98 on Saturday night.

            The 76ers got a victory instead of overtime when Spencer Dinwiddie's 3-pointer was ruled too late after a video review. 

            Harden added six rebounds and six assists after being booed in introductions and then early in the game. He arrived in January 2021 to play with Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving, then asked out and was gone just 13 months later, swapped in a deal for Ben Simmons at last year's trade deadline.











            Now Durant and Irving are also gone, traded this week.

            “I don’t get caught up in homecomings or the outside distractions,” Harden said. “I think our focus was just to come here and win a game and we did a good job of that tonight.”

            Mikal Bridges scored 23 points in his first game with the Nets, but missed a layup that would have given the Nets the lead with about 2 seconds left. Harden then made two free throws with 0.9 seconds to go, and Dinwiddie's shot after a timeout was too late.

            The Nets started Bridges, Cam Johnson, Dinwiddie and Dorian Finney-Smith, the four players they acquired this week from Phoenix for Durant and Dallas for Irving. The Nets had the look of a tough defensive team that will miss the scoring of their All-Stars, managing only one basket in the last 6 1/2 minutes. 

            “We were getting good looks, just sometimes you can’t control,” Bridges said. “They look good and don’t go in.”

            The Nets were ahead by nine midway through the fourth quarter before Embiid capped an 8-0 run with a basket that cut it to 96-95 with 3:55 remaining. The Sixers missed numerous chances to take the lead from there until Embiid grabbed the rebound of Harden's missed layup and was fouled going back up.

            “The Twins,” as Bridges and Johnson were nicknamed in Phoenix by former teammate Deandre Ayton because they did so much together, had plenty of time to think about moving to New York. Durant's initial trade request came last summer.

            “There was a lot of jokes, especially in the summer when KD wanted to come here and we knew the pieces and who might be the ones that were going to go, and us two was the main two,” Bridges said. “And we joked around, we always said, ‘At least we got us, at least we got us,’ and it happened and that’s still to this day. It’s just like, at least I got my twin with me.”

            Bridges had played in all 365 possible games while with Phoenix, along with all 116 games at Villanova, before not being available Thursday night after the trade. 

            “He was shaking. He was like, ‘I’ve got to get out there, I've got to get out there,” said Johnson, who said he told Bridges to calm down.

            But, Johnson then showed Bridges that he'd already played 56 games with the Suns and the Nets still had 37 remaining beginning Saturday, meaning he can actually play 83 games instead of 82.

            “I'm trying to keep his spirits up,” Johnson said.

He arrived in January 2021 to play with Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving, then asked out and was gone just 13 months later, swapped in a deal for Ben Simmons at last year's trade deadline.Now Durant and Irving are also gone, traded this week.“I don’t get caught up in homecomings or the outside distractions,” Harden said. “I think our focus was just to come here and win a game and we did a good job of that tonight.”Mikal Bridges scored 23 points in his first game with the Nets, but missed a layup that would have given the Nets the lead with about 2 seconds left. Harden then made two free throws with 0.9 seconds to go, and Dinwiddie's shot after a timeout was too late.The Nets started Bridges, Cam Johnson, Dinwiddie and Dorian Finney-Smith, the four players they acquired this week from Phoenix for Durant and Dallas for Irving. The Nets had the look of a tough defensive team that will miss the scoring of their All-Stars, managing only one basket in the last 6 1/2 minutes.“We were getting good looks, just sometimes you can’t control,” Bridges said. “They look good and don’t go in.”The Nets were ahead by nine midway through the fourth quarter before Embiid capped an 8-0 run with a basket that cut it to 96-95 with 3:55 remaining. The Sixers missed numerous chances to take the lead from there until Embiid grabbed the rebound of Harden's missed layup and was fouled going back up. His free throws gave Philadelphia the lead for good with 5.2 to play.TIP-INS76ers: Jalen McDaniels, acquired from Charlotte at the deadline, had five points in 16 minutes. ...

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807771,Auburn student wins car in a long-putt contest at Bama game,"AUBURN, Ala. (AP) — In a game where Auburn struggled with its 3-point accuracy, the best long shot of the afternoon by far belonged to a student in the stands.

            During a timeout in the second half of the game against No. 3 Alabama on Saturday, sophomore Craig Noyes made a full-court, 94-foot putt to win a new car.

            Not bad for someone who said he's not a golfer.











            “Honestly, my main goal was just not to whiff or shank it into the bench,” Noyes told The Associated Press.

            “It was so loud when I stepped up to the ball. Once I hit it, I completely zoned out. I couldn't hear anyone,"" he said. “It wasn't until the announcer put a hand on my shoulder and said I'd won a car that I believed it.”

            The sold-out crowd at Neville Arena erupted when he became the first person to win the contest since 2014. Noyes, who writes for the student-run paper The Auburn Plainsman, high-fived fans in celebration.

            Noyes went baseline-to-baseline with his winning putt, rolling the ball through a small hole in a poster at the opposite end to win a car in the contest sponsored by a local Toyota dealership.

            The 20-year-old Noyes, from Kensington, Maryland, said he and some friends camped outside the arena for about 24 hours to get prime seats for the game against the in-state rival Crimson Tide. Around halftime, he was randomly picked as the day's contestant to shoot during an under-12 TV timeout.

            “I was in the tunnel for about 15 minutes, swinging the club and trying to stay loose and relaxed,” he said. “I was so nervous.”

            Noyes instantly heard from a lot of people after the winning shot, saying his phone ran out of juice on the way back to his campus house.

            Auburn players, meanwhile, weren't nearly as successful from long distance. The Tigers made just 7 of 24 shots from 3-point range in a 77-69 loss to Alabama.

            Noyes, by the way, said he didn't own a car. But thanks to a lucky putter, he'll soon be a driver.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807774,Gholston's 3-pointer at buzzer lifts Missouri over Tennessee,"KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — D'Andre Gholston hit a 3-pointer at the buzzer to give Missouri a stunning 86-85 victory over No. 6 Tennessee on Saturday night.

            With 4.2 seconds left in the game and the Volunteers (19-6, 8-4 Southeastern Conference) leading 85-83, Santiago Vescovi missed a free throw. His second attempt was waived off when Tobe Awaka committed a lane violation, setting up a final chance for the Tigers (19-6, 7-5).

            Gholston took the inbounds and dribbled up the court before taking an off-balance contested 3-pointer from about 30 feet that swished through the net at the buzzer for the win. He was mobbed by his teammates after hitting the shot. 











            “I knew Dre wasn't going to pass,” said Missouri coach Dennis Gates. Gholston hit a game-winning shot earlier in the season against Central Florida.

            The end was similar to Tennessee's Wednesday night loss to Vanderbilt. Vescovi missed a free throw then and a 3-pointer at the buzzer ended the game. The Vols have now lost three of the last four.

            “This had a different feel than the other night,” said Tennessee coach Rick Barnes. “We all hurt for (Vescovi). He's hurting. He's won a lot of games for us.”

            Tennessee came back from a 17-point deficit early in the second half and led the last 7:11 of the game. Tyreke Key came off the bench to score 21 of his 23 points after intermission.

            Key connected on five 3-pointers to help the Volunteers recover from the huge hole that happened early in the second half. Vescovi, who scored 16 points, hit back-to-back 3-pointers that finally pulled Tennessee ahead with 7:15 to go in the game.

            Zakai Zeigler had 11 points and 10 assists for the Vols.

            “We almost panicked,” said Gates. “Our guys stayed with the game plan. We were able to move the ball and challenged ourselves on the 3-point line (the Tigers shot 54%, 14 of 26). That's our identity.”

            Kobe Brown scored 21 to lead the Tigers. Gholston finished with 18 points, Sean East had 17 points, and D'Moi Hodge added 14.

            “I'm proud we were able to execute under adverse situations,” Gates said. 

            Barnes is normally liberal with his substitutions. He kept one lineup in for nearly eight minutes while the Vols recovered from the deficit. Two starters — Julian Phillips (hip flexor) and Josiah-Jordan James — were missing. Phillips tried to play, but couldn't do much. James didn't dress.

            Missouri, which shoots 34% from 3-point on the season, hit 50% (8 of 16) of its long range shots in the first half en route to a 44-32 lead. It was the fifth time Tennessee has trailed at halftime.

            “(Missouri) shot the ball extremely well (in the first half),” said Barnes. “We gave a good effort. We needed to change the game.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807775,New Mexico State players interviewed about alleged hazing,"The chancellor at New Mexico State says players on the basketball team were interviewed by school personnel Saturday about an alleged hazing incident that led to the program's suspension.

            In a letter to the school community, chancellor Dan Arvizu said he was “heartbroken and sickened to hear about these hazing allegations.”

            “Hazing is a despicable act,” he wrote. “It humiliates and degrades someone and has the potential to cause physical and emotional harm, or even death. Sadly, hazing can become part of an organization’s culture, if left unchecked.” 











            He said the team, which arrived back in Las Cruces after its game at California Baptist was canceled, would remain under suspension until further notice. 

            The letter came out a few hours after the school announced it would hold a closed meeting Tuesday night to “discuss limited personnel matters concerning individual employees.” It did not name the employees who were to be discussed. 

            In announcing the virtually unheard-of midseason suspension of a Division I basketball program, the university put coach Greg Heiar and his staff on administrative leave pending an investigation into an alleged violation of university policy.

            “NMSU policy strictly prohibits hazing, in all forms, and it’s something we simply will not tolerate,” Arvizu wrote in the letter. 

            A few hours before the letter came out, two Aggies, Shahar Lazar and Kent Olewiler, announced on social media that they were leaving the team. 

            Neither player had played this season. This was shaping up as a redshirt year for Lazar, a freshman who came to Las Cruces from Israel. Olewiler also took a roundabout path to Las Cruces; he was a preferred walk-on who was not listed on the Aggies official roster

            Lazar said he was leaving because, “I don't think the program that I originally committed to aligns with my beliefs and core values.”

            Olewiler said, simply, “my recruitment is 100% open.”

            The hazing allegations come nearly three months after the Nov. 19 fatal shooting in Albuquerque of Brandon Travis, a 19-year-old student from rival school, University of New Mexico. Aggies forward Mike Peake was suspended early in December while an outside investigator looked into his involvement in Travis' killing. In the moments before the shooting, Peake suffered a leg injury and was later taken to the hospital by three of his teammates.

            Peake has not been charged in the case, which is also under investigation by the district attorney in Albuquerque.

Olewiler also took a roundabout path to Las Cruces; he was a preferred walk-on who was not listed on the Aggies official rosterLazar said he was leaving because, “I don't think the program that I originally committed to aligns with my beliefs and core values.”Olewiler said, simply, “my recruitment is 100% open.”The hazing allegations come nearly three months after the Nov. 19 fatal shooting in Albuquerque of Brandon Travis, a 19-year-old student from rival school, University of New Mexico. Aggies forward Mike Peake was suspended early in December while an outside investigator looked into his involvement in Travis' killing. In the moments before the shooting, Peake suffered a leg injury and was later taken to the hospital by three of his teammates.Peake has not been charged in the case, which is also under investigation by the district attorney in Albuquerque.___Associated Press reporter Jacques Billeaud contributed to this report.___AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/college-basketball and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/02/12,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807783,Wu Yibing 1st Chinese player in ATP final at Dallas Open,"DALLAS (AP) — Wu Yibing became the first Chinese player to reach an ATP Tour final, rallying for a three-set victory over top-seeded American Taylor Fritz in the Dallas Open on Saturday night.

            Wu will play John Isner, who also won after dropping the first set and advanced to the final of his hometown event with a victory over fellow American J.J. Wolf.

            Wu won 6-7 (3), 7-5, 6-4 and survived all nine break points he faced, including five when down a set and trailing 2-1 in the second. Fritz had 20 aces to Wu’s six, but Wu capitalized on two of his four break chances.











            “I think serving nine break points is more tough than winning a match again him,” Wu said. “I just stayed patient because I know I'm very solid with the baseline so there's no rush. When I have a break point, I go for some big shots.”

            Wu broke Fritz to take a 6-5 lead in the second set before breaking the eighth-ranked Fritz, highest among Americans, for a 3-2 lead in the deciding set.

            Fritz, who reached the semifinals at Wimbledon but was coming off a disappointing second-round exit at the Australian Open, had only been broken once in the tournament before facing Wu.

            Wu made history last summer as the first Chinese man to reach the third round of the U.S. Open, doing so as a qualifier. The unseeded 23-year-old is seeking his first title Sunday, with Isner going for his 17th.

            Isner, who became the first tour player with 500 career victories in tiebreakers in the quarterfinals, outlasted Wolf 3-6, 7-5, 7-6 (4) to clinch a spot in his 31st career final.

            The big-serving Isner was broken for the first time in the tournament when Wolf took a 4-2 lead in the opening set. 

            Isner overcame three break points at 2-2 in the second set, and Isner broke to force the deciding set when Wolf double-faulted. Isner had 31 aces to Wolf’s 14 and saved seven of eight break points. 

            “I saved a lot of break points with unreturnable serves,” Isner said. “Without that I would have been dusted off the court 6-3, 6-4. So I’m of course very fortunate to have that weapon in my pocket, and I needed every bit of it today.”

            The 24-year-old Wolf was playing in his second career semifinal after reaching the fourth round at the Australian Open, which propelled to a career-best ranking of 43rd.

            Isner, who lives a few blocks from the venue on the SMU campus, reached the semifinals of the inaugural Dallas Open last year, losing to eventual champion Reilly Opelka in a match that included the longest tiebreaker in tour history (24-22).

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807787,MacKinnon scores 2 to help Avalanche beat Panthers 5-3,"SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) — Nathan MacKinnon had two goals and an assist as the Colorado Avalanche beat the Florida Panthers 5-3 on Saturday night. 

            Logan O’Connor, Matt Nieto and Devon Toews also scored as Colorado won for the second time in five games (2-2-1). Alexandar Georgiev stopped 42 shots.

            “We felt calm all night,’’ MacKinnon said. “I think even at the end there. I thought we handled that PK, the 6-on-5 really well. Just great to see. We had a lot of chances up. We were due, I thought, and we finally broke through.”











            Aaron Ekblad, Sam Bennett and Aleksander Barkov scored for Florida, which snapped a three-game win streak. Sergei Bobrovsky finished with 45 saves.

            Colorado took a 2-0 lead on the Panthers with goals from O’Connor and Nieto within the opening 10 minutes. 

            The score stayed that way until Ekblad floated a shot from just inside the blue line and through traffic past Georgiev at 7:03 of the second. It was his ninth.

            Just 1:05 later, Bennett scored on a hard wrist shot from the right circle to tie it at 2 with his 14th. 

            Colorado regained the 25 seconds later when Toews scored on a big rebound from Bowen Byram's shot. It was his fourth. 

            “I like our response after they made it 2-2 probably the best,’’ Colorado coach Jared Bednar said. “I thought as the game went on (Georgiev) got better and better and the first two goals he probably wants at least one of them back. I thought we were playing a good hockey game up 2-0. … Then once they got those two and the building started going, I was getting a little nervous about what our response would be. And then right away we answer and score to get the lead again.”

            MacKinnon gave the Avalanche a two-goal lead again with a power-play goal with 5:59 left in the middle period.

            Barkov pulled the Panthers back within one goal at 11:03 of the third off a pass from Sam Reinhart for his 15th.

            Florida thought it had tied the score on a power-play goal from Brandon Montour, but play continued as officials ruled correctly that the defenseman’s shot with 4:21 remaining struck the goal cage and never fully crossed the goal line.

            MacKinnon sealed the win with an empty-netter with 58.5 seconds left for his 16th.

            “We did not get the start we wanted, they dominated us in the first period,” Barkov said. “I don’t know what happened there, but we came back and played a solid game at the end. We just did not get the goal or get the win at the end.”

            NOTES: The Avalanche lost D Erik Johnson to a lower-body injury in the second period. Johnson appeared to block a shot and got hit in the lower leg; he had to be helped to the dressing room and did not return. ... Barkov returned to the Florida lineup after he missed his team’s game Thursday against San Jose. Barkov blocked a shot with his hand Monday against the visiting Lightning. With Barkov returning, Florida made C Colin White a healthy scratch.

He also won album of the year with ""Harry's House,"" song of the year with ""As It Was,"" and best pop/R&B act.""I'm so so proud to be a British artist in the world out there,"" Styles said.The category for best artist was made gender-neutral last year after non-binary singer Sam Smith was automatically excluded from previously gendered categories in 2021.But the new gender-neutral category controversially had an all-male shortlist this year, with no female or non-binary artists in the mix.Styles acknowledged this in his acceptance speech, naming women who had made the longlist but not the final shortlist.""I'm really really grateful for this and I'm very aware of my privilege up here tonight so this award is for Rina, Charli, Florence, Mabel and Becky,"" he said, referring to pop stars Rina Sawayama, Charli XCX, Florence + the Machine, Mabel and Becky Hill.Brit Awards chair Damian Christian previously said it was disappointing to see an all-male shortlist for best artist, but blamed this on a lack of eligible 2022 releases by major female acts.On Saturday, other artists spoke out about the lack of recognition for women at the Brit Awards.""There is a lot of diversity in artists but there is not enough diversity in record labels,"" said Rina Sawayama, who was nominated for newcomer of the year.Rhian Teasdale, the lead singer for alt rock band Wet Leg, which won group of the year and best artist, thanked all the women involved in helping make the band's self-titled debut album.""This is so scary because being on the telly can feel like a real boys' club thing,"" she said.zc/ar (Reuters, AFP, AP)",2023/02/12,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807810,"Young, Hunter pace Hawks past reeling Spurs 125-106","ATLANTA (AP) — Trae Young had 24 points and a season-high 17 assists, De’Andre Hunter added 24 points and the Atlanta Hawks beat the reeling San Antonio Spurs 125-106 on Saturday night.

            The Spurs (14-43), losers of a season-high 12 straight, are a half-game ahead of last-place Houston (13-43) in the Western Conference. Atlanta (29-28) has won two straight and four of six. The Hawks are eighth in the East.

            The losing streak is San Antonio's longest since the 1988-89 club dropped a team-record 13 in a row. 











            “They play their (butt) off,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. “They do everything they can. We’ll just keep forming good habits and hope that this builds and builds as the weeks and months and next season come along.""

            Atlanta never trailed after Young’s layup early in the third made it 65-64. The Hawks went on a 12-0 run to take a 75-64 lead, the game’s first in double digits, on a pair of free throws by John Collins. A dunk by Clint Capela made it 82-70 at the 4:39 mark of the third, and the Spurs called timeout.

            “San Antonio is always going to play hard and always play the right way, meaning there’s going to be five guys out there connected,"" Atlanta coach Nate McMillan said. “They’re going to be moving the ball. They’re going to be working hard trying to outscrap you. That’s just the way they play. 

            ""It took us 24 minutes to start establishing and coming with that urgency that we needed on both ends of the floor.""

            Young hit two free throws to make it 93-77 entering the fourth with Atlanta’s biggest lead. San Antonio was just 5 for 22 from the field in the third and was outscored 32-17. The lead swelled to 23 in the fourth.

            “I think we just picked up the pressure defensively and got out and ran more and got some better shots and some faster shots,"" Young said. “I think we were going too slow in that first half, and they were pushing the pace and pushing it at us. We just knew we had to pick up the pressure.""

            Keldon Johnson, San Antonio’s leading scorer this season, was back in the lineup after missing Friday’s double overtime loss at Detroit with left ankle soreness and finished with 25 points. Jeremy Sochan added 18.

Atlanta (29-28) has won two straight and four of six. The Hawks are eighth in the East.The losing streak is San Antonio's longest since the 1988-89 club dropped a team-record 13 in a row.“They play their (butt) off,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. “They do everything they can. We’ll just keep forming good habits and hope that this builds and builds as the weeks and months and next season come along.""Atlanta never trailed after Young’s layup early in the third made it 65-64. The Hawks went on a 12-0 run to take a 75-64 lead, the game’s first in double digits, on a pair of free throws by John Collins. A dunk by Clint Capela made it 82-70 at the 4:39 mark of the third, and the Spurs called timeout.“San Antonio is always going to play hard and always play the right way, meaning there’s going to be five guys out there connected,"" Atlanta coach Nate McMillan said. “They’re going to be moving the ball.

The lead swelled to 23 in the fourth.“I think we just picked up the pressure defensively and got out and ran more and got some better shots and some faster shots,"" Young said. “I think we were going too slow in that first half, and they were pushing the pace and pushing it at us.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807811,Harmon helps Texas Tech top No. 12 Kansas State 71-63,"LUBBOCK, Texas (AP) — Texas Tech found itself in yet another another tight conference game. This time the Red Raiders were able to pull out the victory.

            De’Vion Harmon scored 20 points, including a crucial driving basket in the final minute, as Texas Tech upended No. 12-ranked Kansas State 71-63 on Saturday night.

            “I missed like my first six shots,” Harmon said. “But the coaches and my teammates had confidence in me and told me to continue being aggressive. It was a good team win.”











            Victories have been elusive for the Red Raiders since the start of conference play. Tech has been in most of its league games, but has fallen short down the stretch with the latest example coming Wednesday on the road against Oklahoma State as Tech gave up a three-point play as time expired and lost 71-68.

            It was a different story against the Wildcats, though. Tech took the lead in the final minutes of the first half and never relinquished it, despite Kansas State pulling within one point on four occasions and two points two other times during the final 10 minutes.

            “I think that speaks volumes for this team,” Tech head coach Mark Adams said. “We’ve been in this situation many, many times. We know we want to win, but we haven’t been able to. We just kept encouraging these guys to stay aggressive, make plays and have no regrets.”

            The Red Raiders (13-12, 2-10 Big 12) held the Wildcats to two field goals in the game’s final four minutes as they extended a 62-61 lead at the 2:15 mark.

            Jaylon Tyson added another huge basket for Tech with a tip-in that pushed the advantage to 64-61, setting the stage for Harmon’s slashing drive between defenders as the Red Raiders rebounded from a last-second road loss to Oklahoma State.

            Kevin Obanor added four free throws in the final 37 seconds and Harmon converted one of two as Tech held off the Wildcats, who got only a pair of free throws and layup from Markquis Nowell in the final two plus minutes.

            “I was disappointed that we gave the ball away as many times as we did,” Kansas State head coach Jerome Tang said of his team’s 23-turnover night. “Texas Tech gets credit for that, but it’s also us not being tough enough.”

            Kansas State (19-6, 7-5) edged as close as one point throughout the second half, but Tech answered with key baskets to maintain the lead. The Wildcats were led by Nowell’s 18 points. Desi Sills added 12 points.

            The Red Raider defense limited Kansas State guard Keyontae Johnson, who had been averaging 18 points per game, to just nine points.

            “He picked a bad night to have a bad night,” Tang said.

            Lamar Washington added 13 points for Texas Tech while Tyson and Obanor contributed 11 and 10, respectively.

            The Red Raiders took control in the final moments of the first half, outscoring the Wildcats 10-1 in the final moments and turning a 25-23 deficit into a 33-26 advantage. Harmon sparked the flurry, scoring seven of his nine first-half points.

            Kansas State had claimed the 25-23 lead on a layup by Sills, but Tech responded quickly as Harmon converted a 3-pointer, a driving basket and a shot from the corner, and Jaylon Tyson added a 3-pointer.

            BIG PICTURE:

            Kansas State struggled from the field throughout the game. The Wildcats converted just under 35 percent of their shots in the first half, including 3 of 12 from 3-point range. The woes continued after intermission with the Wildcats finishing 19 of 54 overall (35.2 percent) and 6 of 26 from beyond the 3-point arc. Between the turnovers and the cold shooting night, the Wildcats were unable to overcome the Red Raiders.

            Texas Tech knocked off its second nationally ranked opponent on its home floor with its most complete effort this season against a Big 12 foe. The Raiders took the lead late in the first half, forcing 14 Wildcat turnovers, and led the rest of the way. Overall, the Tech defense harassed Kansas State into 23 turnovers, leading to a handful of transition baskets and keeping Tech in front.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807812,Nijel Pack leads No. 19 Miami to 93-85 win over Louisville,"CORAL GABLES, Fla. (AP) — Nijel Pack scored 22 points and No. 19 Miami beat Louisville 93-85 on Saturday night.

            Five days following its dominant 22-point home win over Duke, Miami (20-5, 11-4 Atlantic Coast Conference) could not shake off the conference’s last-place team until Pack’s 3-pointer with 2:44 remaining made it 82-72. Pack shot 8 of 14, including 4 of 9 on 3-pointers.

            Isaiah Wong and Norchad Omier finished with 21 points each and Jordan Miller added 10 for the Hurricanes, who are 14-0 at home.











            “I feel in the ACC records don’t really matter,” Wong said. “Everybody’s tough. Everybody competes with the same energy. We just kept focused and played the hardest.”

            El Ellis scored a career-high 33 points and had five assists while Jae’Lyn Withers finished with 18 points for the Cardinals (3-22, 1-13).

            The Hurricanes built double-digit leads early in each half but Louisville responded and avoided the lopsided margins common of its season.

            “That was a heck of a college basketball game,” Miami coach Jim Larrañaga said. “I thought we played really well. I thought Louisville played outstanding basketball.”

            The Hurricanes scored 20 points off turnovers and clinched the win with six converted free throws in the final 40 seconds. They finished 23 of 27 from the line.

            “When you’re playing a team like Miami, you can’t give them 20 points off your turnovers,” Cardinals coach Kenny Payne said. “Whenever there’s adversity, we compound the mistakes. We can’t compound mistakes, especially on a night when we’re scoring the ball really well.”

            Bensley Joseph hit a 3-pointer 4:41 into the second half to put Miami ahead 60-49, but the Cardinals rallied and narrowed it to single digits. 

            Ellis’ two free throws with 4:47 remaining cut the gap to 74-70.

            “We were just trying not to let the game get out of reach,” Ellis said. “And even if they go on a run we had to continue to try to get stops and be solid on offense.”

            The Cardinals overcame a game-starting 10-0 deficit and took their first lead at 34-33 on Ellis’ jumper with 4:35 remaining in the first half. Withers’ lay-up capped a 9-0 run and made it 36-33.

            After Ellis’ lay-up gave Louisville another three-point advantage at 38-35, Miami responded with seven unanswered points. Pack’s lay-up with 1:10 left ended the spurt before Kamari Lands’ 3-pointer with three seconds remaining got the Cardinals within 42-41 at halftime.

            “We knew how good Ellis was and how big they tried to play,” Pack said. “In the second half we had to step it up defensively.”

            HOME FOR THE WEEKEND

            The Hurricanes’ first half of the conference schedule featured one weekend home game. But the contest against Louisville began a stretch of four consecutive Saturday home appearances at Watsco Center. Miami’s remaining conference home games — all on Saturday — will be against Wake Forest, Florida State and Pittsburgh.

            BIG PICTURE

            Miami: The victory secured the Hurricanes’ 20th season of at least 20-wins. Eight of those seasons are under Larrañaga.

            Louisville: Ellis has scored 20 or more points in 10 games - five in the conference. He shot 1 of 10 from the field and finished with seven points in the Cardinals’ 80-53 home loss against Miami Dec. 4.

            “At the beginning of the season I was still trying to adjust the way coach wanted me to play,” Ellis said. “Tonight was one of those games that I let the game come to me. When you do that, the rim gets even bigger.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807813,"Sharp-shooting Wizards score 80 in half, rout Pacers 127-113","WASHINGTON (AP) — Bradley Beal scored 32 points, Kristaps Porzingis and Monte Morris added 17 apiece and the Washington Wizards shot 70% from the field through the first three quarters of their 127-113 rout of the Indiana Pacers on Saturday night.

            Washington led 80-57 after its highest-scoring half of the season. The Wizards gave up the first 10 points of the third quarter, bringing back memories of a couple recent games in which they blew 20-point leads, but they steadied themselves quickly and led 104-88 heading into the fourth.

            Washington was able to substitute liberally toward the end — 13 players appeared for the Wizards — and a late slide dropped their final shooting percentage down to 64%, costing them a franchise record but setting a season high by a comfortable margin.











            “We talked about it at halftime — we're not going to shoot 70% all game,” Washington coach Wes Unseld Jr. said. “But we still shot pretty well. That was kind of the messaging. Don't get complacent with just making shots.""

            Tyrese Haliburton scored 21 points and Myles Turner had 20 for Indiana, which has lost 15 of its last 17.

            Washington, which pulled even with Chicago for ninth place in the Eastern Conference, was without Kyle Kuzma because of a sprained left ankle. 

            The Wizards had 18 turnovers to Indiana's eight and allowed 27 second-chance points, but none of that made much difference with Washington shooting such an incredible percentage. The Wizards shot 73% from 2-point range, 46% from 3 and 86% on free throws.

            The Wizards went 15 of 20 from the field in the first quarter — including 12 of 13 inside the arc — and led 37-29. It took a little while before Washington really broke the game open, but an 18-4 run late in the first half made it 80-55. 

            The Wizards have won two in a row following a three-game losing streak in which they led by at least 20 in losses to Portland and Brooklyn. They traded Rui Hachimura recently and acquired Kendrick Nunn, but it was otherwise a quiet trade deadline for Washington.

            “I think our biggest thing is being healthy,"" Beal said. ""This is our team. You can't make any adjustments now. You've got to ride it out throughout the rest of the year.”

            CONSISTENCY

            Often when a team shoots an unusually high percentage early, it regresses dramatically at some point, but the Wizards shot 75% in the first quarter, 71% in the second and 62% in the third. They finally dipped to 48% in the fourth, missing their final four attempts of the game.

            TIP-INS

            Pacers: George Hill and Jordan Nwora, acquired Thursday from Milwaukee in a trade, are expected to suit up for the Pacers next week. ... Daniel Theis (right knee) did not play.

            Wizards: Daniel Gafford scored 13 points on 6-of-6 shooting. ... Before Saturday, Washington's top shooting percentage this season was 58% at Philadelphia on Nov. 2. The franchise record is 65.3% on April 8, 2015, also at Philadelphia.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807814,Jokic carries short-handed Nuggets past Hornets 119-105,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — Nikola Jokic had 30 points, 16 rebounds and 10 assists for his league-leading 20th triple-double and the short-handed Denver Nuggets handed the Charlotte Hornets their seventh straight defeat, 119-105 on Saturday night.

            Kentavious Caldwell-Pope added 15 points and Bruce Brown and Michael Porter Jr. each had 14 for the Nuggets.

            Denver played without Aaron Gordon (rib contusion) and Jamaal Murray (knee inflammation), but outscored the Hornets 62-45 in the second half.











            Jokic now has twice as many triple-doubles as Dallas' Luka Doncic, who was second in the league with 10 entering the weekend.

            But the two-time NBA MVP said that doesn't mean a thing to him, adding, “it's just how I play, and I don't even think about it.”

            He was more excited about the Nuggets snapping a four-game losing streak on the road.

            “It's really important just to get back to winning after our loss (Thursday night) to Orlando,"" Jokic said. “We didn't start well, but in the second half our defense won the game.”

            Jokic made light work of Hornets rookie Mark Williams and third-year player Nick Richards, using his big body to post up on the low block to seemingly score at will with overpowering moves in the lane.

            When the Hornets doubled him, Jokic found open teammates.

            Williams and Richards are seeing more extensive playing time after the Hornets traded Mason Plumlee to the Los Angeles Clippers.

            “Knowing that Mason Plumlee is not here and they have younger guys, yeah you want to try to go out there and test them,” Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. “Mark Williams is only going to get better playing through his mistakes. Nick Richards getting to play meaningful minutes off the bench will get better against guys like Nikola.

            “We always say in the NBA, you have to get baptized. Young guys have to go through the fires and get their (butts) kicked once in a while. That’s how you learn, that’s how you improve and how you get better.”

            This was Jokic's second big game this season against Charlotte.

            Jokic had 40 points, 27 rebounds and 10 assists in Denver's 119-115 win in December.

            “They went to him every play,” Hornets coach Steve Clifford said. ""We needed to have ways to keep him off balance, which we didn’t. He showed you why he’s been an MVP, and he may be again.”

            P.J. Washington had 22 points and Gordon Hayward added 21 for Charlotte. LaMelo Ball finished with 18 points, 12 assists and nine rebounds.

            The Hornets endured another rough night from the foul line, converting just 17 of 29 attempts. Charlotte is 28 of 52 from the stripe in its last two home games. 

            The Hornets jumped out to a 26-12 first-quarter lead behind 13 points from Hayward, who was 6 of 7 from the field. But the Nuggets would trim the lead to three at halftime as the Hornets faltered from the free throw line, going 2 of 11 before the break.

            Denver (39-18) pulled away in the third quarter behind Jokic, Caldwell-Pope and Porter, who combined for 26 points. 

            BRYANT SITS OUT

            Malone said he didn't feel right playing center Thomas Bryant, who was acquired Thursday in a trade with the Los Angeles Lakers. Malone said he loves Bryant's work ethic and he will soon figure into the Nuggets rotation.

            Jokic said is eager to see what Bryant can do after averaging 12.2 points and 6.8 rebounds with the Lakers.

            “We have to learn about him and see how he can help us and he needs to see if he can help us, too,” Jokic said. “I'm excited to have another player who can contribute and help us win.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807824,Brunson scores 38 as Knicks outlast Jazz in Hart's NY debut,"NEW YORK (AP) — Jalen Brunson scored 22 of his 38 points in the first half, Josh Hart had 11 points off the bench in his Knicks debut and New York outlasted the Utah Jazz 126-120 on Saturday night.

            Julius Randle added 31 for New York, which has won three of four to improve to 31-27. R.J. Barrett scored 20 points before fouling out, and Immanuel Quickley finished with 15. 

            “We have a lot of unselfish guys who are willing to do whatever it takes to win,” Brunson said. “As long as we’re keeping that our main priority, we’re going to continue to get better.”











            Hart, acquired Wednesday night from Portland, made a quick impact on his new team while adding seven rebounds and four assists.

            “Josh was huge. How many did he have? Seven? Seven rebounds, something like that,” Barrett said of his new teammate. “He brought a lot of effort, toughness.”

            Lauri Markkanen scored 29 points to lead the Jazz, who lost for the fourth time in five games. Jordan Clarkson had 24, Talen Horton-Tucker added 23 off the bench and Collin Sexton finished with 15.

            “Sometimes it's just the game gets away from you and you struggle with some of the details on the defensive end,” Jazz coach Will Hardy said. “Situational basketball is something we talk about a lot.”

            Hart snapped a 101-all tie with 6:44 left in the fourth with a corner 3 off a feed from Brunson — his former college teammate at Villanova. On the ensuing possession, Isaiah Hartenstein fouled Markkanen to prevent a dunk. After Utah’s power forward knocked down both free throws, Hartenstein’s follow dunk allowed New York to regain its three-point lead.

            The teams traded baskets over the next two minutes, culminating with Clarkson’s 12-footer which tied it at 109.

            “Madison Square Garden, it’s tied, four minutes left, the place is rocking,"" Hardy said. “It's a great environment for our team and we relish those moments. Obviously we wish we could have executed better down the stretch.”

            Consecutive 3-pointers from Brunson and Barrett gave New York a 115-109 lead with 3:49 left. A few moments later, Randle’s third 3 extended the advantage to 118-109.

            On New York’s next two possessions, Randle had a baseline dunk and found Hart with a cross-court pass that pushed the lead to 123-114.

            “I like the way he's attacking the basket,” Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said of Randle. “He's attacking the rim and it sets up everything else for him. He knocks down a couple 3s (and) now they come up on him. He uses his quickness and strength really well.

            “When I see his aggressiveness, I know we're (going) to be hard to beat.”

            TIP-INS

            Jazz: Hardy said the next step in Markkanen’s development is to become a leader. “His presence has to change a little bit in the locker room,” Hardy said before the game. “It has to change a little bit at practice and shootaround and film sessions. Stepping into that leadership role a little bit more now with that void being there.” Markkanen is averaging 24.7 points and 8.6 rebounds per game, and as such Hardy thinks he can handle increased responsibility. “He’s ready for that,” Hardy said.

            Knicks: About 3 1/2 hours before tipoff, Hart met reporters for the first time as a member of the Knicks. Hart, who was teammates with Randle with the Lakers to go along with his friendship with Brunson, believes he has found a home in New York. “Obviously on the court, there’s a lot of things I’m excited about, with teammates and Thibodeau) and the front office I’m familiar with,” Hart said. ""It’s my third time getting traded, sixth year in the league, fourth team, sixth head coach. It’s been a whirlwind. I didn’t think that was how my first six years were going to be, but I’m looking for a home, and I think this could be it.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807825,"Biden hosts GOP, Dem governors at White House for dinner","WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden, hosting both Republican and Democratic governors for a black-tie affair at the White House, raised his glass for a toast.

            Standing under a portrait of Abraham Lincoln, he told the people in the room to remember who they were. “We’re the United States of America. We can get big things done if we do it together.”

            “Cheers!"" the crowd replied, as the clink-clink of glasses rippled about the State Dining Room. 











            Biden hosted the dinner for members of the National Governors Association at the White House for the first time in his administration. It's usually a tradition, but the dinner was held last year at Mount Vernon, George Washington's Virginia estate, and virtually in 2021 because of COVID-19. 

            The dinner came as federal leaders seemed as divided as ever with the new Republican majority in the House courting a risky debt ceiling showdown. 

            On Saturday at the White House, though, the message was togetherness — and not just because the room was tightly packed with governors, spouses and Cabinet members. Biden and both associations' leaders, Republican Gov. Spencer Cox of Utah and Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy of New Jersey, spoke about the need to put aside the increasingly rancorous political differences in order to work together to better the nation. 

            “I think when we work together it works,"" Biden said, adding he'd work to be a little more bipartisan and praised the work of the governors. 

            The tables were set with purple velvet tablecloths (wink wink on bipartisanship), china bearing the presidential seal and large floral centerpieces in white and pink.

            Cabinet members were mixed together with governors in ball gowns, tuxedos and sparkles. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer sat near Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo. Maryland Gov. Wes Moore and New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, both Democrats, sat near Vice President Kamala Harris. Not far away were Republican Govs. Bill Lee of Tennessee and Doug Burgum of North Dakota. 

            First lady Jill Biden held a service project event earlier Saturday for spouses, but she had to skip a Friday event because she wasn’t feeling well. She tested negative for COVID-19. 

            Biden, who does not drink, gave the toast with his left hand, explaining he'd been told by his grandfather that that's just what you did when you don't have alcohol in the glass. Cox, who also doesn't drink, did the same when he toasted, telling the room it was ginger ale. 

            “It's symbolic to have Republicans and Democrats breaking bread together,” Cox said. “This is what is missing.” 

            “And I believe that the people of our country, at least the exhausted majority, wants us to be doing more of this.” 

            Cox thanked Biden and the first lady before introducing Murphy, who joked that he was definitely holding his glass in his right hand. He said their party affiliations were less important than the shared moniker of “Americans.” 

            After dinner, the guests filed into the East Room, where country singer Brad Paisley performed the song “American Saturday Night” and other tunes.WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden, hosting both Republican and Democratic governors for a black-tie affair at the White House, raised his glass for a toast.Standing under a portrait of Abraham Lincoln, he told the people in the room to remember who they were. “We’re the United States of America.

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer sat near Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo. Maryland Gov. Wes Moore and New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, both Democrats, sat near Vice President Kamala Harris. Not far away were Republican Govs. Bill Lee of Tennessee and Doug Burgum of North Dakota.First lady Jill Biden held a service project event earlier Saturday for spouses, but she had to skip a Friday event because she wasn’t feeling well. She tested negative for COVID-19.Biden, who does not drink, gave the toast with his left hand, explaining he'd been told by his grandfather that that's just what you did when you don't have alcohol in the glass. Cox, who also doesn't drink, did the same when he toasted, telling the room it was ginger ale.“It's symbolic to have Republicans and Democrats breaking bread together,” Cox said. “This is what is missing.”“And I believe that the people of our country, at least the exhausted majority, wants us to be doing more of this.”Cox thanked Biden and the first lady before introducing Murphy, who joked that he was definitely holding his glass in his right hand. He said their party affiliations were less important than the shared moniker of “Americans.”After dinner, the guests filed into the East Room, where country singer Brad Paisley performed the song “American Saturday Night” and other tunes.",2023/02/12,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807826,Davis scores 41 to lead Detroit Mercy over Green Bay 76-71,"GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) — Antoine Davis, who trails only Pete Maravich on the NCAA Division I all-time scoring list, poured in 41 points on Saturday to lead Detroit Mercy to a 76-71 victory over Green Bay.

            Davis buried 11 of 22 shots from the floor, including 8 of 15 from 3-point range, and 11 of 13 from the foul line for the Titans (11-16, 7-9 Horizon League). He now has 3,482 career points and trails only the man after whom LSU's arena was named by 185 points. Davis' eight 3-pointers ups his D-I career record to 558. He has scored in double figures a record 138 straight times. 

            A.J. Oliver finished with 15 points and six rebounds for Detroit Mercy. Gerald Liddell added 13 points and five boards.











            Clarence Cummings III had 20 points to lead the Phoenix (3-24, 2-14). Zae Blake added 18 points off the bench as the Green Bay reserves outscored the Titans' subs 21-0. Davin Zeigler scored 12, while Cade Meyer had 11 rebounds to go with seven points.

            Davis has now topped the 20-point mark 99 times in his career. He has scored 30 or more 36 times and 40-plus eight times. 

            Davis, a fifth-year senior, has four games left in the regular season plus the Horizon League Tournament to chase the record. Maravich set the mark in three seasons (1967-70) when freshmen were not allowed to play on the varsity. Davis and the Titans had 15 games canceled in the past two seasons because of COVID-19 protocols.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807829,Panarin's 4-goal night helps Rangers stop Hurricanes' streak,"RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — Artemi Panarin tied the game, scored the go-ahead goal and then found the net twice more to overshadow a strong win by the New York Rangers with a dazzling individual performance Saturday night.

            Ever have a game like this?

            “When I was a kid, yeah — against my grandpa,” he said. 











            Panarin scored thrice in the third period during his first four-goal outing, helping the Rangers blow open a close game late and beat the Carolina Hurricanes 6-2 on Saturday night. 

            Mika Zibanejad had a power-play goal in the first period and Kaapo Kakko added an empty-net score for the Rangers. Vincent Trocheck added two assists to help stop his former team's seven-game winning streak.

            Jaroslav Halak finished with 27 saves in his seventh consecutive victory for the Rangers, who won their fifth straight game and pushed their point streak to seven games.

            But it was Panarin who was the star, from scoring the tiebreaking goal off a rebound at 4:33 of the third period to securing his first hat trick since 2019 on a breakaway at 15:59 before adding another one from the slot with 64 seconds left.

            And it wasn't as though he felt a big game coming.

            “Surprise,” Panarin said. “Sometimes when I feel something, it means zero points. ... Four goals, first time in my life.""

            That came after he said his confidence started with a “minus-20” after missing the net on a quality first-period chance.

            It ended up as his first multigoal game this season and fourth career hat trick — second with the Rangers. Panarin also had an assist for his first five-point game since last March 12 at Dallas (one goal, four assists). And his last three goals came after the Rangers shifted lines and didn't have him alongside fellow scoring star Zibanejad.

            “That's the thing with those guys, you can mix and match them a little bit and it's not going to hurt anyone,” Rangers coach Gerard Gallant said.

            Teuvo Teravainen and Jesperi Kotkaniemi both scored in the second for the Hurricanes, who carried a 10-game point streak out of the All-Star break. Carolina hadn’t lost since falling at home to Vancouver in a Jan. 15 shootout.

            Frederik Andersen stopped 13 of 18 shots in the loss.

            The matchup paired teams that squared off in two of the past three postseasons. The first came in the Toronto bubble in 2020, a series Carolina won easily. The second saw the Rangers win on the Hurricanes' home ice to close out a tough second-round series in Game 7 last May.

            Now the Rangers have won both meetings this season, this one coming by the same score as that Game 7 win.

            Panarin pushed the Rangers ahead 3-2 when he put away a loose rebound on Braden Schneider’s shot early in the third. Then, after K'Andre Miller forced Sebastian Aho into a turnover, Panarin charged up ice to beat Andersen at the 15:59 mark.

            Panarin scored his first goal with a transition chance off a Carolina turnover, taking a feed from Trocheck and burying a 2-on-1 opportunity past Andersen’s glove at 17:49 of the second to tie the game 2-all after Carolina had begun to build control of the game.

            His fourth goal came when he took a feed from Jimmy Vesey along the boards and scored from the slot, spinning back toward the middle against Carolina's Calvin De Haan to beat Andersen one final time.

            “We were really sharp. We needed to get more out of that, the two periods,” Carolina coach Rod Brind’Amour said. “That tying goal late in the second, that was a tough one. ... He’s world class for a reason. He was the difference tonight, that’s for sure.”

            FAMILIAR FACES

            It marked a notable meeting for two players facing their former team.

            First there was Trocheck, who left Carolina to sign with New York in the offseason and was playing his first game since in Raleigh. The Hurricanes had acquired Trocheck in 2020 shortly before the COVID-19 shutdown, and he became a vital piece as a two-way center.

            Trocheck received warm applause when acknowledged on the bench during a first-period stoppage, offering a wave to the crowd. 

            Carolina forward Jesper Fast appeared in his 600th NHL game, coming against the team that drafted him. Fast played his first 422 games with New York before signing with Carolina in 2020.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807834,"Blue Jackets down Maple Leafs 4-3, spoil Woll’s home debut","TORONTO (AP) — Joseph Woll waited a long time for his first home start with the Maple Leafs.

            The Blue Jackets spoiled the moment Saturday after Toronto inexplicably took its foot off the gas against the NHL’s worst team.

            Kent Johnson scored the winner in the third period as the last-place Columbus Blue Jackets downed the Toronto Maple Leafs 4-3 on Saturday night to split a back-to-back.











            “Outworked, outplayed,” Leafs coach Sheldon Keefe said of his team’s second period that saw the Blue Jackets grab a 21-10 shot advantage and score three times.

            Boone Jenner and Kirill Marchenko had a goal and an assist each, and Sean Kuraly also scored for Columbus. Elvis Merzlikins had 26 saves.

            The importance of a surprising victory for an injury-ravaged roster on national TV wasn’t lost on Blue Jackets coach Brad Larsen.

            “I grew up (watching) ‘Hockey Night in Canada,’” said Larsen. “We had the old antenna. I think we had three channels.

            “It sticks with you. It means a lot to you as a Canadian-born guy.”

            William Nylander, Michael Bunting and Morgan Rielly each scored for Toronto. Mitchell Marner added two assists.

            Woll made 36 stops for the Leafs in his first start of the season — and first home appearance of his NHL career.

            “Pretty awesome atmosphere to play in,” said the 24-year-old. “Special playing in front of our home crowd.”

            Johnson put the Blue Jackets up for good six minutes into the third when he redirected Cole Sillinger’s shot past Woll for his 11th goal of the season. The goal was reviewed for a possible high stick, but the call on the ice was confirmed.

            Toronto pulled Woll with less than three minutes remaining, but Columbus held on for just its second regulation victory in 11 games.

            The Leafs led 2-0 through 20 minutes and appeared to be cruising to an easy victory before putting in perhaps their worst period of the season in a sleepy second.

            Jenner got the visitors on the board at 4:21 when he snapped his 15th home from the slot off a broken play.

            Marchenko tied it 2-2 with 4:59 left in the period off a Jenner rebound. Kuraly’s go-ahead goal came 57 seconds later.

            The door opened for Woll to play second fiddle to Ilya Samsonov after Matt Murray went down with an ankle injury before the NHL All-Star break.

            Woll might have been called up earlier in the season when both Murray and Samsonov were sidelined, but didn’t make his debut in the American Hockey League until late November as he worked his way back from shoulder surgery before also suffering an ankle injury while rehabbing.

            The 62nd pick at the 2016 NHL draft has been near-perfect in the minors since getting back to full health.

            Woll, who grew up in the St. Louis suburb of Dardenne Prairie, Missouri, is 13-1-0 with a .930 save percentage and a 2.36 goals-against average with the Toronto Marlies. He was the top goalie in the recent AHL skill competition.

            “Unfortunately we didn’t get the win for them,” Woll said of Saturday’s Scotiabank Arena crowd. “But definitely an experience I’ll remember.”

            WILLY STYLES

            Nylander hit the 60-point mark for the fourth time in his career. The 26-year-old is on pace to crack 90 points for the first time since entering the league in 2015-16.

            JOHNNY’S BEEN GOOD

            Columbus winger Johnny Gaudreau picked up an assist in the second period to give him 50 points in 53 games — the quickest a player has reached the half-century mark in franchise history. The previous benchmark was held by Ray Whitney, who accomplished the feat in 56 contests.

(AP) — Tyler Herro scored 23 points, Jimmy Butler added 22 points and seven rebounds and the Miami Heat rallied to beat the Orlando Magic 107-103 in overtime on Saturday night.

            Gabe Vincent, who finished with 20 points, opened OT with a 3-pointer. Herro scored twice from the lane and the Magic, who had led by nine with 2 1/2 minutes left in the fourth quarter, never caught up.

            Markelle Fultz led the Magic with 17 points. Paolo Banchero had 16 points and 13 rebounds and missed a driving layup in the final seconds of the fourth quarter that was altered by Miami center Bam Adebayo.











            Once the game went into overtime, the advantage swung to Miami.

            “We have a ton of experience, so we have the packages where we know where we want to get the ball, facing all the different coverages that we’ve faced,” coach Erik Spoelstra said. “That's a big part of it, but you also have to get the stops.”

            “They're a team with a lot of experience and they’ve been in these situations a ton of times,” Magic coach Jamahl Mosley said.

            Adebayo, who played the entire fourth quarter and overtime, finished with 13 points, 17 rebounds and six assists. He was the centerpiece of the defensive effort that held the Magic to 24 points in the final 17 minutes.

            “Taking the paint away was the biggest thing, not letting them get the easy layups like they did in the first half,” he said. “Really closing out and helping each other. That’s how we’re going to win games down he stretch.”

            The Magic grabbed a 52-35 lead with the Heat shooting below 30% with 10 turnovers in the first 21 minutes. Butler and Adebayo rallied Miami late in the half and Max Strus hit a 3-pointer just before halftime as the Heat pulled within 54-46.

            Mo Wagner scored 10 straight points for the Magic late in the third period, and a dunk by Jonathan Isaac pushed Orlando's lead to 12 early in the fourth. But after a dunk by Bol Bol put the Magic up 91-81, they scored only six points in the final 6:40 of regulation, and only six more in overtime.

            “We had a couple lapses on both ends of the floor, but I think offensively we started to slow down a little and not play our style of basketball,” Fultz said. “We kind of let it stick a little bit. I think they turned up the heat and got a couple of calls to go their way as well.”

            Suggs, Wendell Carter Jr. and Mo Wagner scored 14 points each for the Magic. 

            TIP-INS

            Heat: Butler, whose dunk at the buzzer won Friday night's game against Houston, played both ends of a back-to-back for the first time since October. ... The Heat had 20 turnovers but none in overtime. ... Spoelstra said G Victor Oladipo, who missed a fifth game with an ankle injury, has a chance of playing before next weekend's All-Star break. 

            Magic: F Chuma Okeke, out since Nov. 21 with a knee injury, was slated to play a second G-League game before being reconsidered for the active roster.

            SUGGS SAT OUT THE OVERTIME

            Suggs, who had four steals and three blocks for Orlando and generally wreaked havoc defensively, did not play in overtime.

            “Gary (Harris) was defending Herro decently well,” explained Mosley while acknowledging that “we may have to go back and look at how we may have to get (Suggs) those minutes.”

            Said Suggs, who played 28 minutes: “We realize how close we are, and we need wins in games like this. I kind of feel like we let ourselves down.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807840,Taiwan restaurant bans Tiktok use following Japan's Sushiro incident,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A restaurant in Kaohsiung’s decision to ban the use of TikTok on its premises has generated controversy on social media.On Tuesday (Feb. 7), “Fishers’ Diner” (釣客食堂) wrote in a Facebook post, “Considering the previous incident where someone unhygienically licked public utensils at a large chain restaurant for a TikTok video, we have specially printed 300 stickers to gift to our friends! We also announce that starting today, any TikTok video-making is banned at our restaurant, and TikTok influencers are banned from entering! This is to avoid thoughtless licking.”Supporters of the decision asked for stickers from the restaurant. Others echoed the restaurant owner’s opinion of TikTok.User Ong Long Sim commented, “TikTok is not only dangerous because of cyber security (issues), censorship, and misinformation, it also harms people’s, especially adolescents’, attention span in absorbing information. Apart from hoping there will be relevant regulations to suppress it, I also support the restaurant owner’s active boycott.”Meanwhile, opponents flooded both the Fishers’ Diner’s Facebook page and Google profile with criticism and one-star reviews. “People must get their phone checked to dine at a restaurant? … Who do you think you are?” wrote Facebook user Kung Chuan.“Don’t you know the Japanese uploaded to Instagram?” commented another user named Chen Hao (陳浩). Later, he added, “The Japanese uploaded to Twitter, and now China’s TikTok takes the blame. What nice logic.”Other critics accused the restaurant of politicizing a non-political issue.Fishers’ Diner owner Yeh Jen-jui (葉人瑞) told Taiwan News in an exclusive interview that his intention in enforcing the policy is to prevent further incidents similar to the one in Japan. He added that the restaurant’s staff will not be checking patrons’ phones.While Yeh knew that the Japanese diner who licked utensils at the sushi restaurant chain Sushiro had uploaded to Instagram on Twitter, he said the young man also admitted that he was imitating a “challenge” on TikTok. “Even though he uploaded to Twitter and Instagram, it started on Tiktok.”Regarding the criticism and negative reviews he received, Yeh said, “I respect freedom of speech, but using TikTok as an excuse to attack is wrong. I don’t understand why people got so political about this.” He added that he had already consulted with the restaurant’s legal counsel and is preparing to sue those who leave slanderous, one-star reviews without ever dining there.In a post published on Sunday (Feb. 12), Fishers’ Diner emphasized that its goal is to prevent “challenges” from happening at restaurants and causing trouble for others. It also shared images of news reports about TikTok challenges that had led to dangerous or negative results.“(We) didn’t think TikTok could make so many people lose their minds like this! … ‘The sound of TikTok erases parents’ child-raising efforts’ is such a true slogan,” the restaurant concluded.",2023/02/12,9598,Society

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807854,"Mitchell nets 29 as Cavs rally past Bulls, win streak hits 6","CLEVELAND (AP) — All-Star Donovan Mitchell scored 19 of his 29 points in the second half and Jarrett Allen had 23 points and 10 rebounds, rallying the Cleveland Cavaliers to a 97-89 victory over the Chicago Bulls on Saturday night.

            Mitchell added 10 rebounds and Darius Garland scored 19 for Cleveland, which trailed 61-48 in the third quarter before unleashing a 43-17 run to go up by 13. The Cavaliers won their sixth straight and are 24-6 at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse.

            “This was a big-time win for us,” Mitchell said. “We were getting good looks early and making the right plays, but the shots weren’t falling. Once we started hitting them, we know it’s tough to play here because of our fight and our fans.”











            Zach LaVine scored 23 points, Nikola Vucevic had 14 points and 14 rebounds, and All-Star DeMar DeRozan had 16 points and six assists for the Bulls. Chicago was outscored 20-4 to start the fourth and dropped its third in a row.

            The Cavaliers were playing the second half of a challenging back-to-back set, arriving in Cleveland at 4 a.m. following their 118-107 win in New Orleans. That nationally-televised game tipped after 10 p.m. Eastern.

            “To find the fortitude to grind this one out, that’s special,” Cavaliers coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. “The mental toughness the guys showed when things weren’t going our way, you talk about growth, that’s what this was.”

            Evan Mobley had 14 points and Garland dished out seven assists, helping Cleveland extend its lead over Brooklyn for fourth place in the Eastern Conference to 2 1/2 games. The Cavaliers swept their four-game season series with Chicago.

            The Bulls committed 23 turnovers, were 5 of 21 on 3-pointers and only managed 60 points over the final three quarters.

            “We just shot ourselves in the foot an enormous amount tonight,” Chicago coach Billy Donovan said. “A lot of it is the team learning how to stop the bleeding. Everyone is trying their best, but we’re not getting the results we want.”

            Cleveland’s reserves missed 18 of their 19 field goal attempts, including all 13 3-pointers, with Ricky Rubio coming up empty on six tries and Dean Wade missing his five shots.

            Mitchell scored a franchise-record 71 points in the teams’ previous meeting Jan. 2, a 145-134 overtime win at home by the Cavaliers. It tied for the eighth-most points in a game in NBA history and was the highest total in the league in 17 years.

            EYES WIDE OPEN

            The Bulls are in the thick of the battle for a play-in tournament spot in the East. Chicago hasn’t made a roster move since mid-December, but that could change soon as vice president Arturas Karnisovas and general manager Marc Eversley are actively looking at contract-buyout possibilities around the NBA.

            “There have definitely been discussions and we have talked some names, but obviously, I can’t say who they are,” Donovan said. “You would take a good player who we would all feel confident could help us.”

            TIP-INS

            Bulls: G Lonzo Ball (left knee surgery), who has not played in a game since Jan. 14, 2022, will have his status updated by Karnisovas following the All-Star break. Ball has been able to dunk in recent weeks and could be nearing a return. … C Andre Drummond averaged a franchise-high 12.9 rebounds over two seasons with Cleveland, leading the NBA in 2019-2020. … Chicago wrapped up a three-game trip.

            Cavaliers: G Dylan Windler (right ankle sprain) was in uniform for the second time, but did not get into the game. The 2019 first-round selection has missed the entire season after experiencing multiple setbacks. “It’s been tough because there have been random bumps in the road that you can’t account for,” Bickerstaff said. Windler has only appeared in 81 games as a pro. … Cleveland has sold out all 30 home games.

            Kentavious Caldwell-Pope added 15 points and Bruce Brown and Michael Porter Jr. each had 14 for the Nuggets, who snapped a string of four straight road losses.

            Harden added six rebounds and six assists after being booed in introductions and then early in the game. He arrived in January 2021 to play with Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving, then asked out and was gone just 13 months later, swapped in a deal for Ben Simmons at last year’s trade deadline.

            Mikal Bridges scored 23 points in his first game with the Nets, but missed a layup that would have given the Nets the lead with about 2 seconds left. Harden then made two free throws with 0.9 seconds to go, and Dinwiddie’s shot after a timeout was too late.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807859,Defiant ruling party supporters celebrate in Nicaragua,"MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) — Nicaragua’s ruling Sandinista political machine mobilized a few thousand of its faithful Saturday to celebrate the government’s decision to expel 222 opposition leaders, activists, priests, students and journalists.

            Waving the red and black flags of the Sandinista National Liberation Front, marchers carried out the sort of peaceful public demonstration that the government has denied to the opposition in recent years.

            Carrying a portrait of Vice President and first lady Rosario Murillo, Lizbeth Chávez said “we are marching, celebrating our sovereignty, defending our sovereignty and telling the Yankee empire that here we are, here we will continue to be, here we’re staying.”











            President Daniel Ortega had said that the sudden decision to put 222 imprisoned opposition members on a plane to Washington on Thursday was Murillo’s idea. The ruling couple called the prisoners “terrorists” who were sponsored by the U.S. government and sought to destabilize their government.

            While the plane was still in the air, Sandinista lawmakers approved a constitutional reform that would strip the prisoners of their Nicaraguan citizenship.

            The United States gave them all humanitarian parole, allowing them to work in the U.S. for two years and apply for asylum. Spain’s government offered them all citizenship.

            U.S. officials called the massive release a positive sign after years of intransigence from Ortega, who insisted he asked for nothing in return. The U.S. and European countries have increased sanctions against Ortega’s family, inner circle and members of his government. 

            The show of defiance Saturday came one day after a Nicaraguan judge sentenced outspoken government critic Catholic Bishop Rolando Álvarez to 26 years in prison on a variety of charges, including spreading false information and undermining the government.

            Álvarez had been in line to board the plane Thursday morning when he refused to leave Nicaragua. He was imprisoned and sentenced the next day. Nicaragua’s Catholic leadership remained silent Saturday.

            At Saturday’s march, Donal Manuel Mendoza walked among the throng. “We are marching because we have defeated the imperial mercenary force,” he said. “We’ve kicked them out of the country.”MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) — Nicaragua’s ruling Sandinista political machine mobilized a few thousand of its faithful Saturday to celebrate the government’s decision to expel 222 opposition leaders, activists, priests, students and journalists.Waving the red and black flags of the Sandinista National Liberation Front, marchers carried out the sort of peaceful public demonstration that the government has denied to the opposition in recent years.Carrying a portrait of Vice President and first lady Rosario Murillo, Lizbeth Chávez said “we are marching, celebrating our sovereignty, defending our sovereignty and telling the Yankee empire that here we are, here we will continue to be, here we’re staying.”President Daniel Ortega had said that the sudden decision to put 222 imprisoned opposition members on a plane to Washington on Thursday was Murillo’s idea.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807861,Jones scores 18 in 2nd half as Stanford stuns No. 4 Arizona,"STANFORD, Calif. (AP) — Spencer Jones scored all 18 of his points in the second half for Stanford and played a key role in neutralizing Pac-12 leading scorer Azuolas Tubelis, as the Cardinal stunned No. 4 Arizona 88-79 on Saturday night.

            Stanford (11-14, 5-9 Pac-12) beat a ranked team for the first time this year and a top-four team for the first time since they topped No. 3 UCLA in 2007. Arizona (22-4, 11-4), hoping to stay a half-game behind UCLA for the conference lead, had a seven-game win snapped.

            Courtney Ramey scored a season- and game-high 26 points for Arizona, which could not overcome Tubelis’ worst game of the season. The junior forward, who had 40 points against Oregon on Feb. 2 and had averaged a near double-double this season (20.9 points, 9.7 rebounds) to lead the conference in both categories, was held to four points.











            Tubelis did not have a rebound and committed four fouls.

            Stanford repeated a game plan that helped them stay close in a four-point loss to Arizona in last year’s conference tournament. They gave Arizona the perimeter and aggressively worked to keep the ball away from the 6-foot-11 Tubelis and 7-foot center Oumar Ballo, who was limited to eight points.

            “They have big-time players, and on the inside, if they get paint touches, there’s nobody in the country who’s going to stop them,” Stanford head coach Jerod Haase said. “So you’ve got to try to find a way to limit the touches inside.”

            The result was forcing Arizona to attempt 35 3-pointers. They made 14, but as Ramey said, “That’s not going to win us a lot of games. When we’re chucking up a lot of threes, we take it back to the drawing board.”

            Stanford’s Michael O’Connell scored a career-high 22 points, helping the Cardinal outshoot the Wildcats 61% to 46% from the field. Brandon Angel added 14 points for Stanford, Maxime Reynaud had 13 points and Harrison Ingram contributed 12 points and a game-high nine rebounds.

            Pelle Larsson and Cedric Henderson Jr. scored 12 points apiece for the Wildcats.

            Jones credited Arizona for keeping the ball away from him in a scoreless first half, the way the Cardinal did with Tubelis. But Jones’ teammates found a way after intermission to get their team’s leading scorer the ball.

            Jones took command of a back-and-forth game a third of the way through the second half, scoring all 13 of Stanford’s points during a nearly seven-minute stretch that ended with a layup that gave the Cardinal a 67-66 lead with 7:35 remaining.

            A 3-point play by Angel extended Stanford’s lead to 70-66 before a Ramey 3-pointer cut the lead to one.

            But the Cardinal scored the next nine points, punctuating the run with a wide-open 3-pointer by O’Connell that extended their lead to 79-69 with 3:28 left.

            “You could feel the energy in the gym,” O’Connell said. “Everyone’s mood kind of changes and gets more confidence on the offensive side and the defensive side.”

            Stanford limited Arizona to 3 for 9 shooting over the final 5:42 of the game.

            BIG PICTURE

            Arizona: The Wildcats have to find a way to make halftime adjustments when their interior scorers spend the first 20 minutes being denied the ball. Future opponents are going to watch a lot of tape from Saturday’s game to see how Stanford did it.

            Stanford: The Cardinal passed a huge test in their win over the No. 4 team in the country by not folding after Arizona used a 9-0 run late in the first half to take a 44-35 lead.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807862,"Former King Brown has No. 23 retired, statue unveiled","LOS ANGELES (AP) — Dustin Brown admitted to being uncomfortable when Luc Robitaille first told him that the Los Angeles Kings were not only going to retire Brown's number, but also immortalize him with a statue outside Crypto.com Arena.

            As Saturday's ceremony got closer, the former longtime Kings captain was able to let it all sink in.

            Brown not only had his No. 23 retired before Los Angeles' game against the Pittsburgh Penguins, but a statue of him holding up the Stanley Cup was unveiled before faceoff.











            Brown joins Robitaille and Wayne Gretzky as former Kings to have statues outside the downtown LA arena.

            “I’ll touch on what Luc told me, which made me feel better. Because I said ‘Luke, you’re you and I mean Wayne is Wayne.’ But he told me ‘You did something we never did’ and that made me immediately feel better about the whole situation,” Brown said during first intermission.

            Brown played 18 seasons with the Kings before retiring at the end of last season. He holds the franchise record for games played (1,296). He was the 13th overall pick in the 2003 NHL draft and made his debut against Detroit on Oct. 9, 2003.

            In 2007 he was named the youngest and first American-born captain in franchise history at 23 years old. He was the captain for eight seasons, including when the Kings won the Stanley Cup in 2012 and ’14.

            “Throughout my 18 years, I experienced the highest of highs and the lowest of lows. C or no C I always wanted to retire a King,” Brown said during the one-hour ceremony. “Seeing my jersey raised to the rafters, my only hope is that in the future when you look up and see it hanging there, you think not about my achievements but our achievements.”

            Brown — who grew up in Ithaca, New York— is the seventh player in the franchise’s 55 seasons to have his number retired. He joins Rob Blake (No. 4), Marcel Dionne (No. 16), Dave Taylor (No. 18), Robitaille (No. 20), Rogie Vachon (No. 30) and Gretzky (No. 99).

            Before the ceremony began, Brown led the current Kings team onto the ice, where they took their place on stage. The ceremony ended with Brown lifting the Stanley Cup in the same spot he did in 2012 when Los Angeles defeated the New Jersey Devils in six games for its first championship.

            “Shortly after being drafted, Dustin said he wanted to be the first King to lift the Stanley Cup. Where else but LA could a script like that happen?” said Rob Scuderi, who played on the Kings with Brown for five seasons.

            Brown is sixth in franchise history in goals (325), seventh in points (712), and eighth in assists (387).

            “I don’t like the attention, but I’m proud of everything,"" Brown said. ""I got to share it with a lot of important people in my life, so that’s the main thing. It seemed to go smoothly from my perspective.”

            He wouldn't specify his reasons for souring so quickly, but made clear he felt there were problems within the Nets organization.

            “There was just a lot of dysfunction — clearly. There was a lot of internal things that I'm not going to ever just say or put in the media or anything, and that was one of the reasons why I chose to make my decision,"" Harden said after scoring 29 points in the 76ers’ 101-98 victory.

            “But now, fast forward to today, I don’t look like the crazy one,"" he added. ""I don’t look like the guy, or the quitter or whatever the media want to call me. Like, I knew what was going on and I just decided to, like, I’m not built for this. I don’t want to deal with that. I want to play basketball and have fun and enjoy doing it.”

            Harden was acquired from Houston in January 2021 and the Nets quickly became a championship favorite with their potent lineup. But they lost in the second round of those playoffs after both Irving and Harden were injured against Milwaukee, then struggled to get off the ground in 2021-22 after Irving refused to be vaccinated against the coronavirus so he could be eligible to play in all their games.

            After Durant sprained his knee in January 2022, the Big Three was often down to just one and Harden's effort and interest seemed to wane while forced to carry a team that had to play unproven players around him. He told the organization he wanted to leave and the Nets sent him to the 76ers in a package for Ben Simmons.

            Harden wouldn't say if the Nets' problems — or his frustrations — started with the difficulty in being able to count on Irving. 

            “I mean, that’s not something that I’m going to answer,"" Harden said. ""But the reason I made that decision to get out of my comfort zone, which was leave Houston and do everything that I did to get out of there, was to come in and play with KD and Kyrie. And with that being said, that didn’t happen as much as I would like to or probably the organization wanted to.""

            It turned out to only be 16 games. 

            Durant originally asked for a trade last summer and finally got it Thursday when the Nets dealt him to the Phoenix Suns. A few days earlier, the Nets had moved quickly to grant Irving's request to leave by dealing him to the Dallas Mavericks.

            “There’s a lot of possibilities of what could’ve happened, but it’s part of life,” Harden said. “Move on, and I’m sure everybody’s in a better place, a good place.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807881,New Zealand city grinds to halt as deluge from cyclone looms,"WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — Auckland residents hunkered down Monday as they braced for a deluge from Cyclone Gabrielle, two weeks after a record-breaking storm swamped New Zealand's largest city and killed four people.

            Much of Auckland ground to a halt as train services were canceled, libraries and most schools were closed, and authorities asked people to make only essential trips. 

            Air New Zealand canceled all domestic flights to and from Auckland through Tuesday morning, as well as many international flights. Some international routes would continue operating, the airline said, although they might need to be diverted from Auckland. The carrier also canceled domestic flights to and from the cities of Hamilton, Tauranga and Taupo.











            In all, Air New Zealand canceled more than 500 flights. More than 10,000 international customers had been affected, the airline said, with thousands still to be rebooked.

            The cyclone, which was moving south, dumped more than 220 millimeters (9 inches) of rain in areas north of Auckland, cutting power to about 58,000 households and forcing many roads to close.

            About 46,000 homes remained without power Monday afternoon.

            Authorities declared a state of emergency in Northland, Auckland and some other regions, and were asking some residents in low-lying areas to evacuate.

            Prime Minister Chris Hipkins said the weather had made the start of the year ""incredibly challenging” for people in Auckland and other northern areas.

            “Extreme weather event has come on the back of extreme weather event,” Hipkins said. “For families and businesses, I know that that has been just exhausting, and I want to acknowledge how hard many of them are doing it.” 

            Gabrielle was expected to pass Auckland overnight Monday. Its windspeed was downgraded as gusts abated to about 130 kilometers per hour (80 miles per hour).

            Weather forecaster MetService said there was a very high likelihood of “extreme, impactful, and unprecedented weather"" over many regions, with heavy rain, strong winds and large waves.

            With Hipkins and some other lawmakers unable to immediately travel from Auckland to the capital, Wellington, some events scheduled for this year's opening session of Parliament were rescheduled, including Hipkins' statement outlining his priorities for the year, which has been moved from Tuesday to Wednesday. 

            Two weeks ago, Aucklanders experienced the wettest day ever recorded in the city, as the amount of rain that would typically fall over an entire summer hit in a single day.

            Quickly rising floodwaters and landslides killed four people, caused widespread disruption and left hundreds of homes unlivable.WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — Auckland residents hunkered down Monday as they braced for a deluge from Cyclone Gabrielle, two weeks after a record-breaking storm swamped New Zealand's largest city and killed four people.Much of Auckland ground to a halt as train services were canceled, libraries and most schools were closed, and authorities asked people to make only essential trips.Air New Zealand canceled all domestic flights to and from Auckland through Tuesday morning, as well as many international flights.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807883,Russell shines in return to Lakers after trade by T-Wolves,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — D’Angelo Russell and the new-look Lakers figured things out on the fly to take down the defending champs on their home floor.

            Working to get in sync with his new teammates and eager to complement Anthony Davis and LeBron James, Russell communicated on the court all game long after rejoining his first team where he played from 2015-17. The Lakers picked Russell second overall in 2015 out of Ohio State.

            He had 15 points, six assists and five rebounds in his Lakers return after being acquired from Minnesota at the trade deadline, Dennis Schroder scored 26 points, and Los Angeles beat the Golden State Warriors 109-103 on Saturday night in a rivalry missing the star power of injured greats LeBron James and Stephen Curry.











            “It was a little weird but I'm trying to normalize it,” said Russell, who also played 33 games for the Warriors during the 2019-20 season. “The sooner the better. I've been in this situation. ... After that first stint you kind of get comfortable again. When you get traded so many times the irony comes back with all these teams and just kind of normalize it.”

            Schroder made a key layup with 1:17 to play after Donte DiVincenzo's 3-pointer cut the Lakers' lead to 105-101. Davis had a double-double of 13 points and 16 rebounds and blocked one of his three shots on a late jumper by Klay Thompson.

            “Me and D’Lo literally talked the entire game, about pick-and-roll, what he sees, what I see, what he like, what I like ... just trying to build that chemistry on the fly, with no practice,” Davis said.

            Jordan Poole had 29 points and six assists with a key go-ahead three-point play with 6:23 remaining, but the Warriors floundered down the stretch of the fourth quarter again. He was whistled for an offensive foul with 45 seconds left.

            “They're frustrated we couldn't close out these last two games,"" coach Steve Kerr said. ""We just haven't been able to string together enough wins to create a little momentum and separation in the standings.”

            Poole scored eight straight points early in the fourth with back-to-back 3-pointers that tied the game at 87 with 10:37 left. He also dished off to Ty Jerome for a layup with 5:01 to play.

            James sat out his second straight game with a left foot injury since becoming the NBA's all-time scoring leader Tuesday against Oklahoma City, while reigning NBA Finals MVP Curry was sidelined for a third in a row with a left leg injury. 

            Also playing his first game for Los Angeles following a trade from Utah, Jarred Vanderbilt contributed 12 points and eight rebounds as the last-place Lakers snapped a three-game losing streak. Fellow new addition Malik Beasley missed all six of his 3s and shot 2 for 9 on the way to four points in his first game for the Lakers after being traded by Utah. 

            “It’s a huge win. I couldn’t be more proud of my team,” coach Darvin Ham said.

            JAMES' HEALTH

            A scan done on James’ troublesome left ankle and foot showed no serious issue. 

            Ham expects to see James back on the floor before the All-Star break. When asked whether James might need to be sidelined through the break, Ham offered, “No, I don’t think he’ll allow us to do that.” 

            General manager Rob Pelinka said earlier Saturday that nothing was seriously wrong for James, who topped former Lakers star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar during Tuesday’s 133-130 home loss to Oklahoma City. 

            The game with Golden State marked James’ seventh sidelined by soreness in the left ankle. 

            PAYTON II UPDATE

            The Warriors hadn't made an announcement regarding Gary Payton II's physical and whether they would go through on an agreed trade with Portland to bring the defensive-minded guard back to Golden State.

            “Obviously, this whole thing has been strange. It is what it is,” Kerr said. ""There is not a whole lot to do or say, so we are just waiting it out and seeing how it plays out.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807885,O'Reilly scores in OT to lift Blues over Coyotes 6-5,"ST. LOUIS (AP) — Calle Rosen had two goals and Ryan O'Reilly scored in overtime to lift the St. Louis Blues over the Arizona Coyotes 6-5 on Saturday night. 

            Brandon Saad, Sammy Blais and Robert Thomas also scored for the Blues. Jordan Binnington made 23 saves to help St. Louis snap a five-game losing streak and improve to 8-3 in overtime. 

            “We weren’t playing very quick in the first period, a little methodical and slow,"" Blues coach Craig Berube said. ""I liked a lot of things in the game, especially the second and the third. I thought we did some real good things offensively, and I liked our forecheck a lot tonight.”











            Karel Vejmelka stopped 31 shots as Arizona fell to 3-8 in overtime but earned a point in its sixth consecutive game. Clayton Keller had two goals, and Lawson Crouse, Nick Schmaltz and Nick Bjugstad also scored.

            “We've been playing pretty good hockey since the break,” Keller said. “I think last game was a little sloppy, but tonight we showed good effort. Tough lapses there in the second and a couple tough penalties, but it was a crazy game.”

            O'Reilly scored his 11th of the season 1:02 into overtime in his first game back after missing 14 with a broken foot. 

            “Gosh, it feels so good to contribute,” O'Reilly said. “Just to be back out there with the guys. Especially a game like that, too, when you kind of start flat and find our way. I thought the guys did a good job. I thought there was life on the bench. Guys were talking. Even when we went down a couple, it was positive.""

            Crouse scored his 17th goal with Vejmelka pulled for an extra skater to tie the game at 5 with 57 seconds remaining in regulation.

            Bjugstad scored his 13th on a power play with 6:46 left in the third period to cut the St. Louis lead to 5-4. 

            Keller got his 21st goal this season and second of the game 9:47 into the third to pull Arizona to 5-3. 

            “It was urgent,” Coyotes coach André Tourigny said. “That's the word I have in mind. It was not the party there. Everybody was industrious and was on the job. They were focused on coming back in the game and playing well. Today was a good day.” 

            Rosen registered his first career multigoal game when he scored his sixth of the season 6:44 into the third period and his seventh 1:49 later to expand the St. Louis lead to 5-2. 

            Thomas got his 13th goal just after returning from the penalty box to give the Blues a 3-2 lead 1:27 into the third period. 

            Blais scored his first goal since May 1, 2021, off Nick Leddy's stretch pass right after leaving the penalty box with 2:41 remaining in the second period to tie the game at 2. Blais was reacquired Thursday from the Rangers in the trade that sent Vladimir Tarasenko to New York.

            “It felt really good,"" Blais said. “My first goal of the season, obviously, so coming back to St. Louis and scoring in my first game, I couldn't have asked for better than that.”

            LIGHTING THE LAMP

            Keller’s first goal made him the first Coyotes player to score at least 20 in consecutive seasons since Oliver Ekman-Larsson accomplished the feat from 2014-16.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807886,Wild score twice in shootout to beat New Jersey 3-2,"ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — Mats Zuccarello and Frederick Gaudreau scored in a shootout and the struggling Minnesota Wild rallied to beat the red-hot New Jersey Devils 3-2 on Saturday night.

            Joel Eriksson Ek and Ryan Hartman scored in regulation and Filip Gustavsson stopped 27 shots for the Wild, which ended a three-game slide.

            “They are a good team. We know we’re a good team. We’ve been struggling. But that’s a character win,” Hartman said. 











            Added Gustavsson: “Pressure is good in a way when you can deal with it. It makes you perform even better. And I think we showed up today and, again, like we created our own confidence.”

            Tomas Tatar had a pair of goals for the Devils, whose three-game winning streak ended, but New Jersey is 10-1-2 in its last 13 games. Vitek Vanecek had 22 saves.

            Starting a four-game trip, the Devils are still a league-best 19-3-3 on the road.

            “Every point is big, and we know it. Unfortunately, too bad we couldn’t grab two, but one, we’ll take it, we want to learn what we did wrong and be better next game,” Tatar said.

            Since the start of the 2021-22 season, Minnesota leads the NHL with 24 victories in extra-session games. It is 5-2 in shootouts this season.

            Zuccarello scored on the Wild’s first shootout attempt and Tatar missed for the Devils. Minnesota’s Kirill Kaprizov and New Jersey’s Jesper Bratt each missed in the second round before Gaudreau slowly skated in and lifted a shot high glove side.

            Down by one entering the third period, a slap shot by Matt Dumba caromed off Hartman’s left elbow and past Vanecek at 5:25. Hartman took a few seconds to gingerly get up before celebrating.

            “Especially the way it’s been going lately, it could be easy to just think it’s not going to go our way. That’s not what we did. That’s not how we think. We just believed that if we kept doing the right things our bounces would come and they did,” Gaudreau said.

            The Devils led 2-1 after two periods thanks Tatar’s first multigoal game since April 12, 2021, when he played for Montreal. New Jersey entered the game 22-0-1 when leading after two periods.

            After an opening period where New Jersey struggled to get a consistent forecheck or offensive zone time, Tatar took a feed from Ondrej Palat and rocketed a shot past Gustavsson early in the second. Just over three minutes later he redirected a blast from Damon Severson.

            Tatar had 15 goals and 15 assists and was a minus-22 last season, his first with New Jersey. This year the left wing has 30 points — 12 goals — and is a plus-28.

            With 35-goal scorer Jack Hughes out, New Jersey coach Lindy Ruff knows success will come when scoring by committee. “On a night like tonight you got to find ways to put the puck in the back of the net. … But Tatar’s game, he was in on some quality opportunities and took advantage of a couple nice plays and was around the front of the net.”

            Badly outplayed in a 4-1 loss in Dallas on Wednesday and a 5-1 home loss to Vegas on Thursday, the Wild came out with a strong effort and a quick lead when Eriksson Ek redirected a wrist shot by Calen Addison for a power-play marker almost six minutes in.

            SUCCESS FROM THE BLUE LINE

            New Jersey defenseman Dougie Hamilton had an assist to extend his point streak to seven games. He has five goals and nine assists during in the span. His 37 assists for the season match a career-high set in 2016-17 with Calgary.

            Addison’s assist gave him 23 for the season, and it was his 18th power-play point. Both are tops among NHL rookie defensemen.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807918,Sergio Hudson delivers colorful ‘90s celebration at NYFW,"NEW YORK (AP) — Sergio Hudson created a nostalgic scene with shoulder pads, neon colors and graffiti prints taken right out of the early '90s with his latest collection Saturday.

            Hudson, who has dressed the likes of Beyoncé and Michelle Obama, borrowed inspiration from artist Jason Naylor’s colorful and borderline psychedelic murals for New York Fashion Week in an eclectic celebration of energy.

            Models walked on a graffiti print by Naylor with voluminous Fran Drescher hairstyles in multi-colored mini dress suit sets to thumping beats. 











            Hudson told The Associated Press that Naylor added his vision to Hudson’s brand name iconography and the two merged their styles into graffiti letters that were spray painted on white T-shirts, incorporated into the fabric of the collection and sequined designs. Aside from Naylor’s striking use of colors for his art, Hudson also said the artist’s murals have a deeper meaning for him.

            During a hard time for his business when he was living in Los Angeles, Hudson said, he came across a Naylor mural.

            “He did this great inspirational painting on the other side of the street,” Hudson said. “When I saw it, it just kind of touched me emotionally. I always said if I ever get the opportunity, I was going to do a collection inspired by him.”

            While meshing Naylor’s fun colors and lettering with his show, Hudson paid homage to another artist. After the Met Gala unveiled its theme to honor late Chanel designer Karl Lagerfeld, Hudson said that he too wanted to add his own interpretation of Lagerfeld’s infamous '90s rebrand of Chanel by adding playful tailoring to his looks.

            Hudson even brought his youthful flair with his red carpet looks as models adorned in slinky dresses with sparkly cut outs walked the runway. Keeping with the times, Hudson brought out a look that has caused some recent commotion in the fashion community — no pants. One model could be seen wearing a cropped suit jacket with what looked like black high waisted undies.

            Celebrities in attendance included “The View” co-host Sunny Hostin, journalist Joy Reid, and model and brand founder of Baby Phat, Kimora Lee Simmons, who was supporting her daughter Aoki Lee Simmons walking the runway.

            This season, Hudson said he wasn’t designing for a specific person in mind but for everyone.

            “I am proud of the American fashion industry for the strides they made to be more inclusive,” he said. “They have made a quantum leap in the past year or two.”NEW YORK (AP) — Sergio Hudson created a nostalgic scene with shoulder pads, neon colors and graffiti prints taken right out of the early '90s with his latest collection Saturday.Hudson, who has dressed the likes of Beyoncé and Michelle Obama, borrowed inspiration from artist Jason Naylor’s colorful and borderline psychedelic murals for New York Fashion Week in an eclectic celebration of energy.Models walked on a graffiti print by Naylor with voluminous Fran Drescher hairstyles in multi-colored mini dress suit sets to thumping beats.Hudson told The Associated Press that Naylor added his vision to Hudson’s brand name iconography and the two merged their styles into graffiti letters that were spray painted on white T-shirts, incorporated into the fabric of the collection and sequined designs.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807932,"Strawther, Timme rally No. 16 Gonzaga to 88-81 win over BYU","SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) — Julian Strawther scored 26 points, including the go-ahead 3-pointer with 3:10 remaining, and No. 16 Gonzaga rallied to beat BYU 88-81 on Saturday night.

            Drew Timme added 19 points, eight assists and seven rebounds for the Bulldogs (21-5, 10-2 West Coast Conference).

            After trailing 71-68 with 4:09 to play, Gonzaga made 3s on three straight possessions to climb past the Cougars. Strawther knocked down back-to-back 3s before finding Nasir Bolton for another one to put Gonzaga ahead 77-73 with 2:21 left. 











            “These guys just trust me to make big shots. They find me and I’m always gonna shoot those,” Strawther said. 

            Gonzaga was 3 of 14 behind the arc before the late flurry that gave the Zags their seventh straight win over BYU. 

            For the second time this season, the Cougars held a late lead over Gonzaga only to see the Bulldogs roar back. 

            “What a ballgame. It was an intense game from the jump and it always is with BYU. Again, we just found a way to win,” Gonzaga coach Mark Few said. ""In physical games like this you just have to make plays. It’s not so much what you're running at that point, you just have to make plays. I think our guys showed a lot of toughness to get through this one.” 

            It was the final scheduled matchup between the Zags and Cougars, with BYU leaving for the Big 12 next season. Gonzaga is 25-7 against the Cougars in West Coast Conference play, with the chance of another meeting next month at the league tournament in Las Vegas.

            “It was a war, man. They’ve got a good team and they always play us well. This is a good little parting gift from the Kennel, I guess,” Timme said.

            Spencer Johnson and Fousseyni Traore led the Cougars with 17 points apiece, but BYU (16-12, 6-7) lost for the fifth time in its past seven games.

            Gonzaga held a slim lead for nearly the entire first half, but a 3 from Noah Waterman with 25 seconds left gave the Cougars their first lead, 37-34, going into halftime.

            BYU led by a basket with 3:40 remaining but couldn’t keep up down the stretch as Gonzaga came from behind to complete the season sweep. 

            Gonzaga managed to outrebound BYU 19-12 in the second half after losing that battle in the first period, and Cougars coach Mark Pope felt that was the turning point.

            “Just so much frustration right now. Thought the guys battled hard, but we’ve got young guys learning huge lessons right now,” Pope said. “Tonight, the game was on the line, and we had to go grab rebounds — it doesn’t matter what it takes. We had to do that, and we didn’t.” 

            BIG PICTURE

            BYU has dropped two straight and fallen into the middle of the WCC pack.

            Gonzaga is a game behind first-place Saint Mary's in the WCC and will have the opportunity to even the season series Feb. 25 when it hosts the Gaels.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807935,Pregnant Rihanna soars in Super Bowl halftime performance,"Rihanna was above it all. And pregnant to boot. 

            She began and ended the Super Bowl 57 halftime show hovering high above the field at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. 

            The performance lacked the surprise guests stars included in many previous Super Bowl halftimes, save one — her representative revealed afterward that the singer is pregnant with her second child. 











            Rihanna wore a puffy, bright red jumpsuit with tight, rubbery garb underneath that showed a baby bump that fueled a wave of social media speculation until the big revelation. She stood on a transparent rectangular platform that raised and lowered as she belted out the lyrics to “Bitch Better Have My Money” over the turf where the Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs were battling moments earlier.

            Dancers wearing white ski-style suits and shaded goggles had their own suspended platforms that moved in concert with hers.

            She and the dancers were lowered to a long stage that matched her outfit as she sped through hits including ""Work,"" “Where Have You Been,” and “Only Girl,” belting out “Want you to make me feel like I’m the only girl in the world.”

            There were also none of the constant costume changes and scene shifts from previous years. The theme — and the color scheme — stayed the same throughout the 13-minute show, with red lights bathing the stage at times and golden fireworks exploding in the air above her.

            The long stage allowed for extended pull-away shots as she stared down the camera and overhead tracking shots of Rihanna and her dancers. 

            At one point she powdered her face and checked it in a mirror before getting back on the mic. 

            Lights sparkled from the stands as she was hoisted alone back into the air and sang “Diamonds” — with its refrain of “shine bright like a diamond” — as the set closed.

            
                Rihanna's performance was her first solo performance event in seven years, and her first since becoming a mother for the first time nine months ago.

            A SIMPLY SPANGLED BANNER

            Country star Chris Stapleton made the national anthem a simple affair at Super Bowl 57, standing alone on the field accompanied by only his electric guitar as he sang “The Star Spangled Banner” moments before the Kansas City Chiefs kickoff to the Philadelphia Eagles to start the game. 

            Dressed simply in smooth black denim and sunglasses, with neatly combed hair instead of his signature feathered cowboy hat, he sang the anthem as a plaintive ballad, picking it up to rock only briefly as he delivered the final lines “banner yet wave” and “land of the free!” 

            His anthem felt slow, but it clocked in at 2 minutes, 2 seconds, under the 2 minutes, 5 seconds predicted by oddsmakers. But it was more than 10 seconds longer than last year’s sung by another country star, Mickey Guyton.

            Eagles coach Nick Sirianni and starting center Jason Kelce both had tears in their eyes during Stapleton’s emotional performance.

            As the eight-time Grammy winner sang, “CODA” star Troy Kotsur, the first deaf man to win an acting Oscar, signed the anthem lyrics.

            OTHER ANTHEMS 

            Before Stapleton's anthem, “Abbot Elementary” star Sheryl Lee Ralph performed “Lift Every Voice and Sing.”

            Wearing a flowing red velvet gown, Ralph began the song dubbed the Black national anthem as a reflective ballad, and it became a soaring hymn as it went on, with military-style drums joining her and a choir dressed all in white chiming in behind her on the field at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. 

            And R&B legend Babyface delivered “America the Beautiful” as a soulful folk song, playing an acoustic guitar painted with an American flag and blue flowers as he stood alone on the field. A backing track with drum machines and singers kicked in before he was done.

            FAMOUS FANS, PERFORMERS AND PITCH PEOPLE 

            Die-hard Chiefs fan Paul Rudd was on the field before the game, sporting a big smile and a team jersey. 

            Philadelphia native Bradley Cooper, wearing an Eagles T-shirt, celebrated from the stands as his team put the first points of a thriller of a game on the board. Another famous Philly fan, Kevin Hart, wearing a jersey, stood and flapped his arms. 

            Jay-Z, Tiffany Haddish, rapper GloRilla and chef Gordon Ramsay were also spotted in the stadium.

            Pregame performances came from DJ Snake and Jason Derulo, whose backup dancers included synchronized robot dogs. 

            Many stars have made the scene at Super Bowl week parties.

            Many others, including Serena Williams, Adam Driver and John Travolta, are showing up in the big game's big commercials. 

            And U2 revealed in a commercial late in the game that they were returning to the concert stage for the first time since 2019.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807957,Makhachev beats Volkanovski to defend UFC lightweight title,"PERTH, Australia (AP) — Islam Makhachev defied a rowdy crowd and a sustained challenge from Alexander Volkanovski on Sunday to cement his supremacy in the UFC lightweight division in a grueling fight in Perth, Western Australia. 

            In the main event of UFC 284, Makhachev defended his 155-pound belt with an unanimous decision (48-47, 48-47, 49-46) to prevail in a five-round slugfest. 

            The 31-year-old also claimed the title of best pound-for-pound fighter from featherweight champion Australian Volkanovski, who saw his 22-win streak ended.











            “People will call me not just ‘champ’, but ‘best fighter in the world’. I’m very happy,” said the Russian who was jeered throughout the fight by a sold-out 13,000 crowd at RAC Arena. 

            “I landed many good punches but he’s strong and a real champion. He was the best fighter in the world...not now.” 

            Makhachev (24 wins, one loss) had to fend off a furious challenge from the 34-year-old Volkanovski but his grappling and wrestling prowess proved enough. 

            Volkanovski, a former concreter and rugby league player, impressed as he moved up a division. He landed several blows and dominated for stretches of the contest but fell in his second defeat from 27 fights. 

            “It was a winnable fight. I’m very harsh on myself,” said Volkanovski, who hopes for a rematch with Makhachev after suffering his first UFC defeat. “I’m still proud of myself and proved people wrong but I expected to win and could have capitalized on things earlier (in the fight). Maybe I held back just a little bit until the last round.”

            Considered the greatest UFC featherweight of all time, Volkanovski faced the toughest challenge of his career against an opponent four inches taller and 15 pounds heavier. 

            Volkanovski, who made his ring walk to the classic Australian song ‘Down Under’, needed to rely on his formidable striking and speed to produce an upset. 

            Both fighters felt each other out initially amid a febrile atmosphere before Volkanovski went on the attack as they traded blows. 

            But Makhachev got on top with his favored grappling and tried to choke out Volkanovski but was unable to. 

            Volkanovski, who holds the nickname ‘The Great’, survived a big left from his opponent in the second round before clawing back into the fight as it went the distance. 

            During a frenetic finish, willed on by giddy fans, a bloodied Volkanovski made his move and a big right-handed blow gave him one last chance, but Makhachev held firm to ultimately prevail. 

            Among the other bouts on the main card, Mexico’s Yair Rodriguez choked out American Josh Emmett to become the interim featherweight champion. 

            “I’ve been dreaming of this moment since I was a kid,” said Rodriguez before holding up his championship belt. 

            The 30-year-old, who earned the submission in the second round, will take on Volkanovski at a later date. 

            New Zealander Justin Tafa knocked out American Parker Porter in the first round of the heavyweight fight after landing a right uppercut. 

            In the welterweight division, hometown Perth hero Jack Della Maddalena defeated Jamaican Randy Brown by submission. 

            It was the first UFC event staged in Australia since the COVID-19 pandemic with the country enduring strict border controls for most of 2020 and 2021.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807970,New Zealand cancels flights as deluge from cyclone looms,"WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — New Zealand’s national carrier canceled dozens of flights Sunday as Aucklanders braced for a deluge from Cyclone Gabrielle, two weeks after a record-breaking storm swamped the nation's largest city and killed four people.Air New Zealand said it was canceling all domestic flights to and from Auckland through midday Tuesday as well as many international flights. The carrier said some international routes would continue operating, although flights might need to be diverted from Auckland.The carrier also canceled domestic flights to and from the cities of Hamilton, Tauranga and Taupo.Cyclone Gabrielle was already affecting the northern part of New Zealand on Sunday. On Monday, it was expected to dump up to 250 millimeters (10 inches) of rain on Auckland.Gabrielle's windspeed was earlier downgraded as the cyclone slowed. Gusts of about 130 kilometers per hour (80 miles per hour) were expected.Weather forecaster MetService said it was expecting a “widespread and significant” weather event, with heavy rain, strong winds and large waves.“Please do take this seriously, we do expect severe weather is on the way,” New Zealand Prime Minister Chris Hipkins told reporters. “So please make sure that you're prepared. Make sure that you've got preparations in place for either if you have to stay put for a period of time, or if you have to evacuate.”Earlier, the cyclone passed near remote Norfolk Island, a territory of Australia that is home to about 1,750 people.Emergency Management Norfolk Island Controller George Plant said Sunday it had issued an all-clear. He said there was some debris on the roads and some power lines were down.“We have been extremely fortunate with the passage of the cyclone as the most destructive winds have just missed us,” Plant wrote on Facebook. “However, there is still considerable clean-up to be undertaken and it may take a while for services such as power to be restored.”As the cyclone began hitting New Zealand's Northland region on Sunday, flooding and winds caused some roads to be closed and thousands of homes to lose power.Two weeks ago, Aucklanders experienced the wettest day ever recorded in the city, as the amount of rain that would typically fall over the entire summer hit in a single day.Quickly rising floodwaters killed four people, caused widespread disruption and left hundreds of homes unlivable.",2023/02/12,132,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807977,Fit-again Afridi to lead defending champions Lahore in PSL,"ISLAMABAD (AP) — Shaheen Shah Afridi will stage a comeback to competitive cricket after three months out with a freak knee injury to lead defending champions Lahore Qalandars in the Pakistan Super League, beginning from Monday.

            Afridi led Lahore to its maiden PSL title last year in Pakistan’s premier domestic Twenty20 tournament that has once again attracted several foreign T20 specialists in a six-team event also featuring two-time champions Islamabad United and past winners Multan Sultans, Karachi Kings, Quetta Gladiators and Peshawar Zalmi.

            Afridi, the lanky left-arm fast bowler, has been Pakistan’s bowling mainstay for the last five years since making his international debut in 2018. But a knee injury during the final of the T20 World Cup against England saw him undergo a long strenuous rehabilitation program before finally getting ready for the PSL.











            “There were times when I wanted to give up,” Afridi said. “I was working on only one muscle and it was not improving. Often during the rehabilitation sessions, I used to say to myself ‘this is enough, I cannot do this anymore.’”

            Afridi used to watch his bowling videos on YouTube to keep himself motivated and ‘push a little more’ but was frustrated to miss international cricket because of injury.

            In Afridi’s absence England whitewashed Pakistan 3-0 in the test series during its historic comeback tour to Pakistan last December, while New Zealand twice came close to beating Pakistan in the drawn two-test series. 

            Afridi, who has a tendency of picking up wickets in the batting powerplay, has taken 70 wickets since making his PSL debut during the third edition of the tournament in 2018. He is third behind his countrymen Wahab Riaz (103), who is the only bowler in the PSL history with over 100 wickets, and Hasan Ali (81).

            “PSL is one of the best leagues in the world and the quality of cricket tests you as a bowler,” Afridi said. “I am very excited to be making my comeback here … I am ticking both the bowling workload and fitness requirement boxes.”

            Lahore might rue the absence of hard-hitting England batter Harry Brook, who will be on national duty while star leg-spinner Rashid Khan will also miss the first three games due to his commitment with the Afghanistan national team.

            However, Lahore has drafted in Englishman Sam Billings and West Indian Shai Hoe to bolster its batting line-up which has the experience of Fakhar Zaman upfront.

            The combination of Afridi and Haris Rauf forms the best pace bowling pair in the PSL with the latter having the capability to tie down batters in the latter half of the innings with his pace and impeccable line and length.

            Pakistan all-format skipper Babar Azam, who won the ICC’s ODI cricketer of the year award for the second successive year, had a forgettable last year in the PSL when his team Karachi Kings could win only one of the 10 league games.

            This year Babar will be leading Peshawar Zalmi after he was traded to Karachi while T20 veteran Shoaib Malik and young middle-order batter Haider Ali were traded from Peshawar to Karachi. 

            Karachi has the experience of Mohammad Amir in its bowling ranks and has also drafted Australian wicketkeeper Matthew Wade and fast bowler Andrew Tye. Although Englishman James Vince might not be available for the entire tournament, left-handed opener Sharjeel Khan will need to shoulder more of the burden of scoring in the absence of Babar.

            Sri Lanka’s Bhanuka Rajapaksa has bolstered Peshawar’s middle-order with young wicketkeeper-batter Mohammad Haris and West Indian duo of Rovman Powell and Sherfane Rutherford also among their ranks.

            Islamabad, winners of the first two of the three editions of the tournament, is a team which believes in match-ups and relies heavily on data to find a winning edge. Led by Shadab Khan, Islamabad has power-hitters in Paul Stirling and Asif Ali with young Azam Khan also making good progress in the T20 format after hitting a century in the recent Caribbean Premier League. 

            Hasan and Faheem Ashraf are its experienced fast bowlers with Shadab tying down the batters with his legbreak bowling in the middle overs.

            Multan got beaten in the final last year and will open the PSL at home against Lahore on Monday. 

            South African pair of Rilee Rossouw and David Miller, Shan Masood and skipper Mohammad Rizwan carry enough experience in the batting lineup, but its bowling resources look thin this year with Shahnawaz Dahani and tall leg-spinner Usama Mir likely to carry the bowling burden. 

            It has beefed up the team in the replacement draft by drafting in globe-trotter T20 specialist Kieron Pollard of the West Indies.

            Veteran Sarfaraz Ahmed will be leading Quetta Gladiators for the eighth successive season after failing to qualify for the final in the last three editions since it won the tournament in 2019. 

            Sarfaraz is expected to bat higher in the order and has got a red-hot Iftikhar Ahmed also in the ranks. Iftikhar hit six sixes in an over against Peshawar Zalmi’s Riaz during an exhibition PSL match last week in Quetta and also made his mark in this season’s Bangladesh Premier League.

            Karachi and Multan will host the first leg of the tournament before Rawalpindi and Lahore stage the second leg. Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore will host the playoffs and the final on March 19.

            Washington State (11-15, 5-9 Pac-12) opened the game with an 8-0 run before Koren Johnson hit a 3-pointer with 9:59 left in the first half to give the Huskies their first lead at 11-10. Gueye hit a jumper and followed with a three-point play about two minutes later and the Cougars never again trailed. Cole Bajema's layup made it 20-all with four minutes left, but WSU scored the next 11 points to take the lead for good and Andrej Jakimovski hit a 3-pointer to open the second half that made it 34-22.

            Washington (13-13, 5-10 Pac-12) has lost four games in a row and five of its last six. 











            Noah Williams, who played 91 games for the Cougars before transferring to Washington in the offseason, had 12 points and four rebounds in his return to Beasley Coliseum. The 6-foot-5 Seattle native averaged 14.1 points in 30 games for Washington State in 2019-20 before seeing his role diminish last season. His father Guy Williams played at WSU and was a second-round pick by the Washington Bullets in the 1983 NBA Draft. 

            Braxton Meah added 11 points and 10 rebounds for Washington. The Huskies have lost four games in a row and five of their last six. 

            The Huskies twice trimmed their deficit to two points in the second half, but each time Washington State had an answer. Williams made a jumper that made it 37-35 with 12:54 left before Justin Powell hit a 3-pointer and Jabe Mullins added two more in a 10-2 spurt over the next five minutes. Jamal Bey and Keyon Menifield each scored four points in an 8-0 run with 1:24 remaining but Bamba answered with two free throws and, after a Washington miss at the other end, Gueye put back a Bamba miss to give the Cougars 53-47 lead with 42 seconds to go. 

            Bey played his 140th career game for the Huskies, a program record. 

            Washington State shot just 29% (17 of 58) from the field, 27% (8 of 30) from 3-point range and 67% (14 of 21) from the free-throw line but outscored the Huskies 24-12 from behind the arc and 14-9 from the stripe. 

            The Cougars outrebounded Washington 47-35 and used a 17-9 advantage on the offensive glass to finish plus-10 (18-8) in second-chance points.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807979,"Kempe has 4 goals, Copley posts shutout as Kings blank Pens","LOS ANGELES (AP) — Adrian Kempe became the first Los Angeles player to score four straight goals, Pheonix Copley got his second career shutout and the Kings rolled to a 6-0 victory over the Pittsburgh Penguins on Saturday night.

            On a night the Kings retired the No. 23 jersey and unveiled a statue of Dustin Brown, Kempe did two things that were last accomplished by their former long time captain, who led the team to two Stanley Cup titles.

            Before Kempe, Brown was the last Kings' skater to have four goals in a game and three goals in a single period.











            “It was a special night for him and for us as well, so we’re happy that we got the win for him,” Kempe said.

            Kempe became the seventh player in the last 30 years to score four straight goals and first since David Backes did it for St. Louis in 2015.

            “I mean, it’s pretty cool, I guess. But it’s not something I think about,"" Kempe said. ""I think I had chances for five, six too, so yeah just one of those nights.”

            Copley, who signed a $1.5-million, one-year extension on Friday, stopped 25 shots for his first shutout with the Kings. Copley's last shutout was with Washington in 2018.

            It was his 16th victory of the season, which ties his career-high from the 2018-19 season with the Capitals.

            “The first game coming off a break can always be kind of a toss up on how we’re feeling, so it was good to get back into the groove and get our legs under us and get a win with it,” he said.

            Anze Kopitar had three assists for the Kings, who were playing their first game since Jan. 31. Los Angeles also got goals from Jaret Anderson-Dolan and Alex Iafallo while Rasmus Kupari, Kevin Fiala and Drew Doughty each added two assists.

            “I think that after watching the Dustin Brown ceremony and having the Stanley Cup come out, if you didn’t have a spark to play already, it put a little more into the game,"" Los Angeles coach Todd McLellan said. “The guys played well. They were rested, fresh and executed well.”

            Casey DeSmith allowed three goals in 18 shots before being pulled early in the second, and Dustin Tokarski gave up three goals in 16 shots for the Penguins, who had 59 shots on goal in Friday night's 6-3 victory over Anaheim.

            “We had some really good looks early and could have got a lead right away but I thought their goalie made some big saves for them. It got away from us as the game went on,"" Pittsburgh coach Mike Sullivan said.

            Kempe had all three goals during the second period, making him the first Los Angeles skater since Jeff Carter on March 4, 2013, against Nashville to have a natural hat trick. Ironically, Carter was on the ice Saturday with the Penguins.

            Kempe, who leads the Kings with 26 goals, had his hat trick during a 13-minute span. He gave Los Angeles a 3-0 lead 1:58 into the second period when he beat DeSmith on his glove side with a shot from the left faceoff circle.

            At 5:18, Kempe took a cross-ice pass from Kopitar and put in a snap shot that went under Tolarski's blocker. Kempe then completed his third career hat trick at 14:27 on the power play when he put in a loose puck in front of the net.

            Kempe got his second power-play goal on a one-timer at 15:09 of the third.

            FRUSTRATED CROSBY

            Pittsburgh's Sidney Crosby not only saw his nine-game points streak snapped, but he picked up a game misconduct midway through the third period following an altercation with Mikey Anderson near the Kings' net.

            DOUBLE NATURALS

            According to the NHL, Saturday marked the fourth time in the last decade there has been two natural hat tricks the same day. Artemi Panarin of the New York Rangers did it as part of his four-goal outing in a 6-2 victory over the Carolina Hurricanes.

            The others were on Nov. 4, 2021 (Seattle's Jordan Eberle and Boston's Patrice Bergeron), Feb. 27, 2016 (Nashville's Filip Forsberg and Ottawa's Mika Zibanejad) and Jan. 18, 2014 (Tampa Bay's Martin St. Louis and San Jose's Joe Pavelski).

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807980,"Jiyai Shin, Michael Hendry win Vic Open women, men titles","BARWON HEADS, Australia (AP) — Former No. 1 Jiyai Shin of South Korea mastered windy conditions with a solid one-under 71 Sunday to win the women’s Vic Open by five shots.

            Shin began her final round two shots behind Australian hope Cassie Porter but found herself five shots in front after nine holes as Porter struggled in the breezy conditions. The 11-time LPGA Tour winner finished with rounds of 67, 71, 66 and 71 for a four-under total of 275.

            While Shin had three birdies and a single bogey on the first nine, the 21-year-old Porter, who led after the first three rounds, had five bogeys in an outward 41, eventually signing for a seven-over 79 which saw her drop back into a tie for fourth with American Emma Talley, six shots off the lead.











            Shin’s main challenge in the last round came from Australia’s Grace Kim who also shot a one-under 71 to move up from fifth into a second place tie with Pavarisa Yoktuan of Thailand.

            The women’s and men’s Vic Opens are being played concurrently on a 36-hole layout at 13th Beach Golf Links at Barwon Heads, near Geelong in Australia’s Victoria state.

            New Zealander Michael Hendry finished with an even-par 72 to win the men’s title by four shots.

            Hendry started the final round with a three shot lead over Australia’s Justin Warren. He had birdies on the first two holes of his final round and at one point led by eight shots. But he mixed three bogeys with three birdies on the first nine played in testing conditions.

            Australia’s David Micheluzzi was the big mover Sunday, shooting a three under 69 to move up four places into a lone second place.

            Warren shot 76 and dropped back into a third place tie with compatriots Andrew Martin and Tom Power Horan.

            The 43-year-old Hendry has been a regular on the Japan Tour for a decade and also has won the New Zealand Open once and PGA twice. His rounds of 64, 62, 69 and 72 gave him a four round tally of 267.

            “The last time I won on the Aussie tour was the 2017 New Zealand Open, so it was great to get across the line again,"" Hendry said. “Just nice to be feeling fit and proving to myself that I’ve still got it.

            “I'm not going to beat the golf course up; I don’t have the length any more. Just being a pretty accurate golfer and pretty good at controlling my ball flight maybe gave me an advantage today because I knew I was going to be able to keep it under the wind more then the guys who hit it long.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807981,Wheeler scores 2 to lead Jets in 4-1 win over Blackhawks,"WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) — Blake Wheeler had two goals an an assist as the Winnipeg Jets beat the Chicago Blackhawks 4-1 on Saturday night.

            Defenseman Josh Morrissey had a goal and an assist, and Mark Scheifele also scored to help Winnipeg win its second straight in its first game since Jan. 30. 

            “The last two days of practice we had a lot of life in practice so you could sense we would come out with some good jump tonight,” Wheeler said.











            Connor Hellebuyck had 31 saves as the Jets completed four-game sweep of the season series with the Blackhawks.

            “I think they’ve got a lot of goal scorers over there and they were pushing the pace on us a little bit, trying to get us on our heels,” Hellebuyck said. “We didn’t break, and that’s the NHL right there. You gotta weather the storm and then you take it back to them, which we did.”

            Tyler Johnson scored for Chicago, and Petr Mrazek stopped 24 shots.

            “They’re a very talented team offensively,” Blackhawks coach Luke Richardson said of the Jets. “The couple mistakes we made in the second period, they really capitalized on. But I loved our first period, the way we skated and played, and I really liked our push in the third.”

            After a scoreless first period, Morrissey got the Jets on the scoreboard at 1:16 of the second with an unassisted backhand shot from the high slot.

            The Jets doubled their lead during a power play when Kyle Connor fired a one-timer at the net and the puck went in off Wheeler’s skate at 7:33.

            Scheifele made it 3-0 with a one-timer with 7:41 left in the second after Wheeler sent him a quick pass to the high slot.

            Chicago had its third power play of the night late in the middle period, but again came up empty on three shots at Hellebuyck.

            “I thought Winnipeg killed well,” Johnson said. “We tried a few different things that they forced us to do and it just didn’t work out for us. We’ve got to try to create a little bit more as a unit.”

            Johnson got the Blackhawks on the board after he reached out his stick and swept a loose puck around Hellebuyck’s skate at 2:08 of the third.

            The Blackhawks ramped up their energy after the goal, but the Jets tightened up on defense.

            Mrazek was pulled for the extra attacker with three minutes remaining, but Hellebuyck smothered a close-in shot and Wheeler scored into the empty net with 25 seconds left to seal the win.

            DIVISION DOMINANCE

            Winnipeg is 14-4-0 against their Central Division foes this season, which is tops in the division. The Jets have also won nine of their past 10 games against division rivals.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808004,Berlin voters express discontent with chaotic status quo,"BERLIN (AP) — The city of Berlin on Sunday held a court-ordered rerun of a chaotic 2021 state election that was marred by severe glitches at many polling stations and hours-long lines as some polling places ran out of ballot papers or received ones for the wrong district.

            Projections showed the center-right Christian Democrats ahead with 27.8% of the vote, followed by the Greens with 18.8%, and the Social Democrats with 18.7%, according to public broadcaster ARD. The final results, along with coalition negotiations, will determine who serves as the mayor and state senators of Germany's capital.

            Berliners have long been frustrated by the city's notoriously dysfunctional administration, which has defied cliches of German efficiency for years and made it the laughing stock of the rest of the country.











            If the final results mirror the projections, it would be the first time in more than two decades that the center-right Christian Democratic Union emerged as the strongest party in Berlin. Kai Wegner, the party's top candidate, thanked Berliners for their votes and promised that “we will make Berlin work again.”

            After the 2021 election, Franziska Giffey, who belongs to German Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s Social Democrats, led the city as Berlin's mayor in a three-party left-wing governing coalition with the Greens and the Left party. The 44-year-old was running again Sunday. 

            Giffey conceded after polls closed that “Berliners are not happy with the way things are now.” However, the projections leave open who will become Berlin’s next mayor as several different coalition options are possible.

            The Constitutional Court of Berlin, one of three German cities that is also a state in its own right, declared the 2021 state vote invalid in November. It said a partial rerun wouldn’t be enough “in view of the large number and severity of the election errors.” 

            The decision followed complaints by several political parties and government entities over the Sept. 26, 2021, election for the state legislature.

            Berlin held four votes that day: the state election, an election for the city’s 12 district assemblies, the German national election and a local referendum. The Berlin Marathon also took place the same day, added to the logistical difficulties.

            Long lines formed outside many polling stations as voters struggled with extra ballot papers. Some polling stations ran out of ballots during the day, and others received ones for the wrong district, leading to a large number of invalidated votes. 

            Another issue was the election was supposed to end at 6 p.m., but voters waiting in line at that hour were allowed to cast their ballots even after the results of exit polls were made public. 

            The head of an international delegation of election observers said Sunday's repeated election appeared to be well-organized and proceeding smoothly. 

            “We are very satisfied with what we have seen,” Vladimir Prebilic, the head of the Council of Europe delegation, told German news agency dpa.

            Among the most pressing issues in Sunday's election was the city's housing market. Rising rents and a housing shortage have made affordable living in the city center almost impossible for many middle-class families.

            Berliners would also like to see an end to some of their city's frustrations.

            Among the most teeth-grinding issues are the much-delayed opening of the city’s airport and the near impossibility of getting an appointment with the city’s citizen centers to apply for a wedding license, register after a move or apply for a new passport.

            The city’s school system is known for its notoriously dilapidated buildings and students who regularly rank at the bottom of the national scores when it comes to reading, math and other subjects.

            Yet, despite the many complaints, the city’s 3.6 million residents also love their city which is praised for its tolerance, buzzing culture and night-life scene, and diversity.

            Around 2.4 million people were eligible to vote in the rerun, but only 48.8% had cast ballots by 4 p.m., according to German news agency dpa.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808005,Ex-minister Christoulides wins Cyprus presidential election,"NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) — Former foreign minister Nikos Christodoulides was elected as the new president of Cyprus in a runoff election Sunday, pledging to revive stalemated reunification talks with the nation's breakaway Turkish Cypriots and to form a coalition government with women filling half of the Cabinet positions. 

            With 100% of ballots counted, Christodoulides had 51.9% of the vote and his runoff rival, veteran diplomat Andreas Mavroyiannis, had 48.1%, according to official election results. Mavroyiannis conceded defeat before the vote tally was complete. 

            Christodoulides, 49, campaigned as a unifying force for ethnically divided Cyprus, eschewing ideological and party divisions. His message resonated with a wide swath of voters.











            “I'm looking you all in the eye and I sincerely make you this promise: I'll do everything I can to appear worthy of your trust,"" Christodoulides told supporters at his victory rally. 

            He made a special reference to the devastating earthquakes in Turkey and Syria. Turkish Cypriots, including members of a volleyball team, were among the more than 33,000 people declared dead in the disaster as of Sunday. 

            “We share in their mourning, and I want to assure them that we stand by their side,"" the president-elect said.

            Mavroyiannis, who previously served as Cyprus’ ambassador to the United Nations, had positioned himself as the agent of change, ushering in a new political era following a decade of rule by outgoing President Nicos Anastasiades. 

            He ran as an independent, but the support he received from the communist-rooted AKEL party, the country's second-largest political party, may have pushed swing voters into backing Christodoulides.

            Speaking to a somber crowd of supporters, Mavroyiannis, 66, who also was Anastasiades’ chief negotiator with the nation's breakaway Turkish Cypriots, said he would not pursue an “active and daily role” in politics but remained willing to offer his counsel to the new government, if asked. 

            “I want to congratulate Nikos Christodoulides for his election victory and to wish more power to him,"" Mavroyiannis said. “I'm saddened that we couldn't fulfill the hopes and expectations for a large progressive changes that our homeland needs.”

            Christodoulides appeared to have won with support from members of the Democratic Rally (DISY) party, whose leader, Averof Neophytou, failed to make it into the runoff. The DISY leadership decided not to formally back either candidate and left it to members of the country's largest party to vote as they saw fit. 

            Many DISY party insiders had blamed Christodoulides, a long-time party member, for running against Neophytou and splitting the party vote. 

            However, many did not want the AKEL, Mavroyiannis’ main backer, to regain a foothold in government and feared the diplomat becoming the next president of Cyprus would threaten the country's fragile economy and pro-Western trajectory. 

            Critics fault AKEL for bringing Cyprus to the brink of bankruptcy a decade ago and for maintaining a pro-Moscow slant.

            Amid the bickering within DISY, Anastasiades, a former party leader, took the unusual step of issuing a statement suggesting that DISY members should work to thwart an AKEL-backed government.

            He urged the party's voters to safeguard the island’s Western orientation and its deepening alliance with the U.S. 

            Christodoulides said he has already received congratulatory messages from world leaders including French President Emmanuel Macron and U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez, chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

            “Our country's European, Western orientation is our steady compass for tomorrow,"" Christodoulides said.

            Trying to mend fences with Christodoulides and divisions within DISY, Neophytou said the president-elect could count on the party's support “for the good of the country.”

            Christoulides inherits the challenge of trying to restart moribund peace talks with the country's Turkish Cypriots, who declared independence nearly a decade after a 1974 Turkish invasion that followed a coup aimed at union with Greece. 

            The island's reunification has eluded politicians during over nearly a half-century of negotiations, despite progress on the shape of an overall peace deal.

            A potential resolution became more complicated following the 2017 collapse of talks at a Swiss resort that many believed had come tantalizingly close to producing a breakthrough. 

            Turkey, the only country to recognize the minority Turkish Cypriots’ independence, has since turned its back on a United Nations-backed arrangement for a federated Cyprus. It advocates instead a two-state deal, which the U.N., the European Union, the U.S. and other countries have rejected.

            As the government spokesman and Anastasiades' close confidant at the time, Christodoulides was a key insider during the failed peace drive in Switzerland. He has blamed Turkey’s insistence on maintaining a permanent troop presence and military intervention rights in a reunified Cyprus as the main reason the negotiations unraveled.

            Christodoulides has said he draws the line at those two Turkish demands but would utilize Cyprus' European Union membership to engage with Ankara on ways to break the current deadlock. 

            “The current state of affairs cannot be considered a solution to the Cyprus issue, and I have expressed my readiness to make use of our European Union membership to break the deadlock and lead us to a settlement as quickly as possible, to reunify our homeland,"" Christodoulides said from his campaign headquarters, flanked by his wife and four daughters.

            On the economy, Christodoulides said a top priority would be to maintain fiscal discipline without endangering the country’s social safety net and to effectively deal with unauthorized migration. 

            The president-elect also aims to expedite development on newly discovered natural gas deposits off Cyprus’ south coast as Europe grapples with an energy crunch.

            “Mr. Christodoulides’ candidacy is an opportunity for Cypriot people to turn the page, with a new type of governance, with a humanist purpose above all else,” voter Neophytos Makrides, 58, said as he cast his ballot in Paphos. “No to corruption and in favor of the right resolution of the Cypriot problem.”NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) — Former foreign minister Nikos Christodoulides was elected as the new president of Cyprus in a runoff election Sunday, pledging to revive stalemated reunification talks with the nation's breakaway Turkish Cypriots and to form a coalition government with women filling half of the Cabinet positions.With 100% of ballots counted, Christodoulides had 51.9% of the vote and his runoff rival, veteran diplomat Andreas Mavroyiannis, had 48.1%, according to official election results.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808006,Israeli police seal up home of Jerusalem attacker's family,"JERUSALEM (AP) — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's hardline government on Sunday agreed to legalize nine settlement outposts in the occupied West Bank, saying the move was a response to recent Palestinian violence. It said it would approve additional settlement construction in the coming days.

            The decision put the government on a collision course with the Biden administration, which has called on Israel and the Palestinians to avoid unilateral actions that could further raise already heightened tensions and undermine hopes for a future peace agreement with the Palestinians.

            The vote came two days after a Palestinian man careened his car into a Jerusalem bus stop, killing three Israelis, including two young brothers, and injuring several others. 











            Earlier Sunday, Israeli security forces sealed up the family home of the Palestinian attacker in a first step ahead of the possible demolition of the apartment. 

            Police released a video showing police and soldiers welding the doors and windows of the apartment in east Jerusalem shut. Netanyahu ordered the dwelling sealed immediately after the Friday attack. 

            
                Three Israelis, including brothers aged 8 and 6, were killed Friday when Palestinian driver Hussein Qaraqa careened into a bus stop in the east Jerusalem settlement of Ramot. Asher and Yaakov Paley's father was one of five people injured in the incident. Qaraqa, 32, was killed by police at the scene. 

            Addressing the Cabinet on Sunday, Netanyahu said that the “appropriate response to terror is strike it with force and further deepen our roots in our land.” He said the government would discuss an “even broader operation against the perpetrators of terrorism” in the occupied West Bank and east Jerusalem. 

            Late Sunday, Netanyahu's office said his Security Cabinet unanimously authorized the legalization of nine settlement outposts, which were built without authorization but have been largely tolerated by a string of Israeli governments. It said a settlement planning committee would meet in the coming days “to approve the construction of new homes in existing settlements” in the West Bank.

            Israel’s new government, made up of ultranationalist parties who oppose Palestinian statehood, has placed expanding settlements at the top of its priority list. 

            Most of the international community considers settlements illegal and obstacles to peace. Som 700,000 Israeli settlers live in the West Bank and east Jerusalem — areas captured by Israel and claimed by the Palestinians as parts of a future independent state. 

            During a visit last month, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the U.S. would oppose “anything” that undermines hopes of a two-state solution, including settlement construction built on occupied lands sought by the Palestinians. 

            There was no immediate reaction from the Biden administration.

            In Jerusalem, police had arrested and interrogated Qaraqa’s family almost immediately after he carried out Friday’s deadly attack. It said that a court had extended the detention of his two brothers and that the investigation was ongoing.

            Qaraqa’s family said he had been diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder and had been released from a hospital just two days before the incident. 

            Israel says demolishing Palestinian attackers' homes serves as a deterrent meant to prevent future attacks. But human rights groups say the practice amounts to collective punishment and leaves relatives who had nothing to do with the attack homeless.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808007,Earthquake in Turkey is only the latest tragedy for refugees,"ANTAKYA, Turkey (AP) — When war broke out in Ukraine, Aydin Sisman’s relatives there fled to the ancient city of Antakya, in a southeastern corner of Turkey that borders Syria. 

            They may have escaped one disaster, but another found them in their new home. 

            They were staying with Sisman's Ukrainian mother-in-law when their building collapsed last Monday as a 7.8 magnitude earthquake leveled much of Antakya and ravaged the region in what some in Turkey are calling the disaster of the century. 











            “We have Ukrainian guests who fled the war, and they are also lying inside. We have had no contact.” said Sisman, whose Turkish father-in-law also was trapped under the rubble of the 10-year-old apartment building. 

            As rescuers dig through heaps of rubble, Sisman appeared to have lost hope.

            Millions of refugees, like Sisman’s relatives, have found a haven in Turkey, escaping from wars and local conflicts from countries as close as Syria to as far afield as Afghanistan.

            There are at least 3.6 million Syrians who have fled their homeland’s war since 2011, arriving in trickles or en masse, sometimes overrunning the border, to seek safety from punishing bombardments, chemical attacks and starvation. Over 300,000 others have come to escape their own conflicts and hardships, according to the United Nations. 

            For them, the earthquake was just the latest tragedy — one that many are still too shocked to comprehend.

            “This is the greatest disaster we have seen, and we have seen a lot,” said Yehia Sayed Ali, 25, a university student whose family moved to Antakya six years ago to escape Syria’s war at its peak. 

            His mother, two cousins and another relative all died in the earthquake. On Saturday, he sat outside his demolished two-story building waiting for rescuers to help him dig out their bodies.

            “Not a single Syrian family has not lost a relative, a dear one” in this earthquake, said Ahmad Abu Shaar, who ran a shelter for Syrian refugees in Antakya that is now a pile of rubble.

            Abu Shaar said people are searching for loved ones and many have refused to leave Antakya even though the quake has left the city with no inhabitable structures, no electricity, water or heating. Many are sleeping on the streets or in the shadows of broken buildings.

            “The people are still living in shock. No one could have imagined this,” Abu Shaar said.

            Certainly not Sisman, who flew from Qatar to Turkey with his wife to help find his in-laws and their Ukrainian relatives.

            “Right now, my mother-in-law and father-in-law are inside. They’re under rubble ... There were no rescue teams. I went up by myself, took a look, and walked around. I saw bodies and we pulled them out from under the rubble. Some without heads,” he said.

            Construction workers sifting through the debris told Sisman that although the top of the building was solid, the garage and foundations were not as strong.

            “When those collapsed, that’s when the building was flattened,” a shaken Sisman said. He appeared to have accepted his relatives were not coming out alive.

            Overwhelmed by the trauma, Abdulqader Barakat stood desperately pleading for international aid to help rescue his children trapped under concrete in Antakya.

            “There are four. We took two out and two are still (inside) for hours. We hear their voices and they are reacting. We need (rescue) squads,” he said.

            At the Syrian shelter, Mohammed Aloolo sat in a circle surrounded by his children who escaped the building that swayed and finally folded like an accordion.

            He came to Antakya in May from a refugee camp along the Turkish-Syrian border. He had survived artillery shelling and fighting in his hometown in Syria's central Hama province, but he called his survival in the earthquake a miracle. 

            Other relatives were not so lucky. Two nieces and their families remain under the debris, he said, holding back tears. 

            “I wish this on no one. Nothing I can say that would describe this,” Aloolo said. 

            Scenes of despair and mourning can be found across the region that only a few days earlier was a peaceful refuge for those fleeing war and conflict.

            At a cemetery in the town of Elbistan, about 200 miles (320 kilometers) north of Antakya, a Syrian family wept and prayed as it buried one of its own. Naziha Al-Ahmad, a mother of four, was pulled dead from the rubble of their new home. Two of her daughters were seriously injured, including one who lost her toes.

            “My wife was good, very good. Affectionate, kind, a good wife, God bless her soul,” said Ahmad Al-Ahmad. “Neighbours died, and we died with them.”

            Graves are quickly filling up.

            At the Turkish and Syria border, people transferred body bags into a truck waiting to take the remains to Syria for burial in their homeland. They included the body of Khaled Qazqouz’s 5-year-old niece, Tasneem Qazqouz.

            Tasneem and her father both died when the quake wracked the border town of Kirikhan.

            “We took her out from under the destruction, from under the rocks. The whole building fell,” Qazqouz said. “We worked for three days to get her out.”

            Qazqouz signed his niece’s name on the body bag before sending her off to the truck heading for Syria.

            He prayed as he let her go.

            “Say hi to your dad and give him my wishes. Say hi to your grandfather and your uncle and everyone,” he cried. “Between the destruction and the rubble, we have nothing now. Life has become so difficult.”

            Titova reported from Elbistan, Turkey, and Abuelgasim from Cilvegozu, Turkey. Associated Press writer Sarah El Deeb in Antakya contributed to this report.ANTAKYA, Turkey (AP) — When war broke out in Ukraine, Aydin Sisman’s relatives there fled to the ancient city of Antakya, in a southeastern corner of Turkey that borders Syria.They may have escaped one disaster, but another found them in their new home.They were staying with Sisman's Ukrainian mother-in-law when their building collapsed last Monday as a 7.8 magnitude earthquake leveled much of Antakya and ravaged the region in what some in Turkey are calling the disaster of the century.“We have Ukrainian guests who fled the war, and they are also lying inside. We have had no contact.” said Sisman, whose Turkish father-in-law also was trapped under the rubble of the 10-year-old apartment building.As rescuers dig through heaps of rubble, Sisman appeared to have lost hope.Millions of refugees, like Sisman’s relatives, have found a haven in Turkey, escaping from wars and local conflicts from countries as close as Syria to as far afield as Afghanistan.There are at least 3.6 million Syrians who have fled their homeland’s war since 2011, arriving in trickles or en masse, sometimes overrunning the border, to seek safety from punishing bombardments, chemical attacks and starvation. Over 300,000 others have come to escape their own conflicts and hardships, according to the United Nations.For them, the earthquake was just the latest tragedy — one that many are still too shocked to comprehend.“This is the greatest disaster we have seen, and we have seen a lot,” said Yehia Sayed Ali, 25, a university student whose family moved to Antakya six years ago to escape Syria’s war at its peak.His mother, two cousins and another relative all died in the earthquake. On Saturday, he sat outside his demolished two-story building waiting for rescuers to help him dig out their bodies.“Not a single Syrian family has not lost a relative, a dear one” in this earthquake, said Ahmad Abu Shaar, who ran a shelter for Syrian refugees in Antakya that is now a pile of rubble.Abu Shaar said people are searching for loved ones and many have refused to leave Antakya even though the quake has left the city with no inhabitable structures, no electricity, water or heating. Many are sleeping on the streets or in the shadows of broken buildings.“The people are still living in shock. No one could have imagined this,” Abu Shaar said.Certainly not Sisman, who flew from Qatar to Turkey with his wife to help find his in-laws and their Ukrainian relatives.“Right now, my mother-in-law and father-in-law are inside. They’re under rubble ... There were no rescue teams. I went up by myself, took a look, and walked around. I saw bodies and we pulled them out from under the rubble. Some without heads,” he said.Construction workers sifting through the debris told Sisman that although the top of the building was solid, the garage and foundations were not as strong.“When those collapsed, that’s when the building was flattened,” a shaken Sisman said. He appeared to have accepted his relatives were not coming out alive.Overwhelmed by the trauma, Abdulqader Barakat stood desperately pleading for international aid to help rescue his children trapped under concrete in Antakya.“There are four. We took two out and two are still (inside) for hours. We hear their voices and they are reacting. We need (rescue) squads,” he said.At the Syrian shelter, Mohammed Aloolo sat in a circle surrounded by his children who escaped the building that swayed and finally folded like an accordion.He came to Antakya in May from a refugee camp along the Turkish-Syrian border. He had survived artillery shelling and fighting in his hometown in Syria's central Hama province, but he called his survival in the earthquake a miracle.Other relatives were not so lucky. Two nieces and their families remain under the debris, he said, holding back tears.“I wish this on no one. Nothing I can say that would describe this,” Aloolo said.Scenes of despair and mourning can be found across the region that only a few days earlier was a peaceful refuge for those fleeing war and conflict.At a cemetery in the town of Elbistan, about 200 miles (320 kilometers) north of Antakya, a Syrian family wept and prayed as it buried one of its own.

Article 24 of the Mortuary Service Administration Act states, ""Independently established ceremony halls and mourning halls shall not be available for corpse processing, holding coffins, or burial ceremonies. Except for the libation and offering ceremonies, no coffins with corpses are allowed in the hall.""In response, Chang said that it is customary not to hold funerals during the Lunar New Year holiday. Coupled with temperature changes, the large elderly population, and the epidemic situation in recent years, the number of freezers was tight during the Lunar New Year holiday, he said.At most, 80 remains were temporarily placed in the ceremony halls, but as the office has been playing catch-up, the number is currently about 20, and those will be put into the freezers soon, the director added.The ceremony halls where the remains are temporarily placed are legally used, Chang said, adding that the office does not want to reject bodies that other places might not be able to accept, per CNA.Chang said that the body storage fee of NT$400 (US$13.20) a day will not be charged until the body is put into a freezer. He added that some family members of the deceased who said that they paid NT$2,000 for dry ice were dealing with funeral operators directly, and the office was not involved in those transactions.",2023/02/12,1868,Society

Some runners were attracted to this competition's views, cool sea breeze, and comfortable climate, according to UDN reporting.In the full marathon, Joseph Mwangi Ngare from Kenya took the lead shortly after the start of the race and led the entire way, crossing the finish line in 2:21:04. Taiwanese runner Chiang Chieh-wen (蔣介文) took second place with a time of 2:24:50.In the women's race, Priscila Chepatiy Kipruto, also from Kenya, finished first with a time of 3:00:19. She was followed by Taiwan's Lee Chia-mei (李佳玫), who took second place at 3:02:05.Large crowds turn out for Kinmen Marathon. (CNA photo)The pair of Kenyan champions traveled to Taiwan from Malaysia just two days ago, noting their entire trip to Kinmen took them 50 hours to complete. They said the race course was quite challenging, though they both pledged to return next year to defend their titles, per UDN.Taiwanese runner Chiang, aged 41, said Sunday’s race was his first marathon of the year and that it went well. He added that his Kenyan counterpart was just too fast, despite being 47 years old. Chieh said his performance was an encouragement and he will keep running competitively for at least a few more years.Race conditions were cool and foggy, limiting the ocean views that some had been anticipating. Still, after being held for the first time in three years, a lot of runners were happy to participate. The same was true for Saturday’s (Feb. 11) 5 km fun run which drew approximately 13,000 participants.Participants in Saturday's fun run were given gift bags containing various items, including a bottle of Kinmen Kaoliang liquor produced in the area. This led to long lines at the end of the race as people jostled to get these giveaways, though in the end they were happy to be outside and engaging in a bit of physical fitness.",2023/02/12,702,Sports & Entertainment

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808027,Neutral Austria under pressure to get tougher on Russia,"VIENNA (AP) — Austria has come under heavy criticism for granting visas that will allow sanctioned Russian lawmakers to attend a Vienna meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.

            The issue highlights the delicate balancing act the European country has engaged in while trying to maintain its longstanding position of military neutrality during the war in Ukraine. The Austrian government has condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine almost a year ago but also stressed the need to maintain diplomatic relations with Moscow.

            Austria hosts several U.N. agencies and international organizations such as the OSCE, which was established during the Cold War as a forum for dialogue between East and West. Russia is one of the 57 nations in North America, Europe and Asia that participate in the Vienna-based organization. 











            Moscow plans to send delegates to the Feb. 23-24 meeting of the OSCE's parliamentary assembly, including 15 Russian lawmakers who are under European Union sanctions. Among them are Deputy Duma Chairman Pyotr Tolstoy and fellow parliament member Leonid Slutsky.

            In a letter to Austria's chancellor, foreign minister and other officials, 81 OSCE delegates from 20 countries, including France, Canada, Britain, Poland and Ukraine, called upon the Austrian government to prohibit the participation of the sanctioned Russians. 

            “It is important to remember that Russian parliamentarians are an integral part of the power system and complicit in the crimes Russia commits every day in Ukraine,” read the letter, which was seen by The Associated Press. “They have no place in an institution tasked with promoting sincere dialogue and opposition to the war.”

            The U.S. delegates to the Parliamentary Assembly were not among the letter's signatories. U.S. Ambassador to the OSCE Michael Carpenter told reporters Friday that the Russian delegates “are not people who deserve to be able to travel to Western countries.” However, Carpenter added that it was “up to the Austrian government to determine whether they are going to grant visas or not.”

            Austrian officials haven’t commented on the letter. On Feb. 5, Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg defended Austria’s decision to allow the sanctioned Russians to enter the country, arguing it was important to keep channels of communication with Moscow open despite the “brutal Russian attack against Ukraine.”

            The Austrian Foreign Ministry also insisted that as host to the OSCE headquarters in Vienna, it is legally obliged to grant visas to representatives of participating nations who want to take part in meetings there.

            Austria, which became a European Union member in 1995, has criticized Moscow and joined the sanctions the EU imposed against Russia over the invasion of Ukraine. But unlike Finland and Sweden, which decided to abandon their non-aligned stances in May by applying to join NATO, Austria remains committed to the military neutrality it adopted in 1955.

            The Austrian government has sent humanitarian aid to Ukraine but no weapons. Chancellor Karl Nehammer became the first and so far only EU leader to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin face-to-face after the war started. Nehammer traveled to Moscow in April 2022 in a fruitless attempt to persuade the Russian leader to end the invasion.

            Support remains strong for Austrian neutrality among the public and political establishment.

            “I believe that Austrian neutrality can still play a positive role today,” saysid Ralph Janik, an expert in international law and researcher at the Sigmund Freud private university in Vienna. “The alternative would be to join NATO, but every single Austrian politician is very well aware that this is not supported by the majority of the Austrian public.” 

            Austria, which was annexed by Nazi Germany in the run-up to World War II, declared neutrality after the war under pressure from Western allies and the Soviet Union. It sought a role as a mediator between East and West and developed ties with Moscow during and after the Cold War.

            In 1968, Austria became the first Western European country to import gas from the Soviet Union, and its dependence on Russian energy increased in the following decades. Before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, 80% of Austria’s natural gas came from Russia. It has since reduced the share to just over 20% by turning to Norwegian gas, according to Austria’s regulator for electricity and gas.

            The Austrian banking system is also closely connected to Russia. Austria’s second-largest bank, the Raiffeisenbank International, earned more than half of its profits in 2022 from Russia. The bank has come under intense pressure for continuing its business in Russia despite Moscow’s war against Ukraine, and is currently evaluating strategic options, including an exit from Russia.

            Vienna is also known to be a playground for spies, including from Russia, due to its lenient espionage laws. Despite its initial reluctance, Austria has expelled eight Russian diplomats who are believed to have been engaged in spying since the start of the Russian war against Ukraine.

            While there are no signs of a shift away from Austrian neutrality, some have called for the policy to be reassessed following the Ukraine war. 

            Werner Fasslabend, a former Austrian defense minister from the conservative People’s Party, is among the few prominent voices arguing in favor of the country renouncing neutrality and joining NATO. With the end of Cold War and Austria’s accession to the EU, Austrian neutrality has “lost its function,” said Fasslabend, the director of the Austrian Institute for European and Security Policy. 

            As a NATO member, Austria would “be in a better position to shape European security policy and will gain greater security,” he added, admitting that it was unlikely to happen given it would require changing the constitution by a two-thirds majority in the Austrian parliament. 

            “This majority is not within sight,” Fasslabend said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808028,Penguins superstar Crosby picks up his first game misconduct,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — There aren't many occasions anymore when one can say Sidney Crosby did something in a game for the first time. 

            Saturday night, though, he accomplished a first he hoped to avoid.

            The Pittsburgh Penguins' superstar received a game misconduct for the first time in his 18-year NHL career midway through the third period of a 6-0 loss to the Los Angeles Kings.











            The two-time league MVP was battling for position with Kings defenseman Mikey Anderson in front of the net and was knocked to the ice. 

            Anderson ended up being called for cross-checking. Anderson and Crosby exchanged words as Anderson skated to the penalty box and Crosby ended up shoving Anderson. Both players ended up getting 10-minute misconduct penalties, but Crosby's got elevated to a game misconduct — which carries an automatic ejection — after continuing to chirp at referee Garrett Rank.

            “I could tell he (Anderson) was saying something. I don’t know what he was saying because we were pretty far from each other. I got closer and that happens often in a lot of scrums,"" Crosby said. ""Honestly, I was shocked that I was getting kicked out of the game. I had no idea.”

            Pittsburgh coach Mike Sullivan said he didn't receive a reason on why Crosby received a game misconduct.

            “I don’t think Garrett had any interest in giving us an explanation,” Sullivan said.

            The 20 penalty minutes were the second highest Crosby has had in 1,160 career games. It is only the fifth time he has had at least 10 minutes of penalties in a game.

            While Crosby was surprised to get the game misconduct, he wasn't about to say how he really felt.

            “I mean, can I really say what I think anyway? Let’s be honest here,"" he said.

This was thanks to flexible traffic control policies such as closing road sections for pedestrians’ use, as well as nearly 500 police officers and volunteer traffic wardens.Additionally, Taipei Metro arranged for every other MRT train to pass by the Sun Yet-sen Memorial Hall station without stopping to increase efficiency. The station’s exits were also under traffic control, while Ministry of Transportation and Communications staff members and volunteers, working with the innovative Skeleton-Print Technology that analyzes people’s postures and actions, monitored the crowd’s movements.Environmental protection-wise, nearly 700 volunteers and nearly 100 street cleaners from the Department of Environmental Protection worked through the night to ensure public spaces’ cleanliness.The crowd on City Hall Road, where traditional lanterns are displayed.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808063,Iranian President Raisi to visit China to shore up ties,"BEIJING (AP) — Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi will meet with his counterpart Xi Jinping during his three-day trip in China starting Tuesday, as the two U.S. rivals seek further cooperation.

            China's Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying made the announcement Sunday, saying Raisi's visit was at Xi's invitation. 

            Raisi will meet with Xi and their delegations will sign cooperation documents, according to Iran's state news agency IRNA. Meeting with Iranian and Chinese business leaders and Iranian expatriates in China is also part of his itinerary, the report added. 











            Raisi's visit is expected to deepen ties between the two political and economic partners that are opposed to the U.S.-led Western domination of international affairs. 

            The two leaders met last September in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, when Xi underscored China's support for Iran. 

            In December, Raisi pledged to remain committed to deepening the strategic partnership during a meeting with Chinese Vice Premier Hu Chunhua in Tehran. 

            China is a major buyer of Iranian oil and an important source of investment in the Mideast country. In 2021, Iran and China signed a 25-year strategic cooperation agreement that covered major economic activities from oil and mining to industry, transportation and agriculture. 

            Both countries have had tense relations with the United States and have sought to project themselves as a counterweight to American power alongside Russia. 

            Washington has accused Iran of selling hundreds of attack drones to Russia for its war in Ukraine and has sanctioned executives of an Iranian drone manufacturer. At that same time, ties between Moscow and Beijing have grown stronger.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808064,"Turkey probes contractors as earthquake deaths pass 33,000","ANTAKYA, Turkey (AP) — Turkish authorities are targeting contractors allegedly linked with buildings that collapsed in the powerful Feb. 6 earthquakes as rescuers found more survivors in the rubble Sunday, including a pregnant woman and two children, in the disaster that killed over 33,000 people.

            The death toll from the magnitude 7.8 and 7.5 quakes that struck nine hours apart in southeastern Turkey and northern Syria rose to 33,185 and was certain to increase as search teams find more bodies.

            As despair bred rage at the agonizingly slow rescues, the focus turned to assigning blame.











            Turkish Justice Minister Bekir Bozdag said 131 people were under investigation for their alleged responsibility in the construction of buildings that failed to withstand the quakes. While the quakes were powerful, many in Turkey blame faulty construction for multiplying the devastation.

            Turkey's construction codes meet current earthquake-engineering standards, at least on paper, but they are rarely enforced, explaining why thousands of buildings toppled over or pancaked down onto the people inside.

            Among those facing scrutiny were two people arrested in Gaziantep province on suspicion of cutting down columns to make extra room in a building that collapsed, the state-run Anadolu Agency said. The justice ministry said three people were arrested, seven others were detained and another seven were barred from leaving Turkey.

            Two contractors held responsible for the destruction of buildings in Adiyaman were arrested Sunday at Istanbul Airport while trying to leave the country, the private DHA news agency and other media reported. One detained contractor, Yavuz Karakus, told DHA: “My conscience is clear. I built 44 buildings. Four of them were demolished. I did everything according to the rules.”

            Rescuers reported finding more survivors amid increasingly long odds. Thermal cameras were used as crews demanded silence to hear those trapped.

            In hard-hit Hatay province, a 50-year-old woman who appeared badly injured was carried out by crews in the town of Iskenderun. Similar rescues in the province saved two other women, one of them pregnant, according to broadcasters TRT and HaberTurk.

            HaberTurk showed a 6-year-old boy rescued from his wrecked home in Adiyaman. An exhausted rescuer removed his surgical mask and took deep breaths as several women cried in joy.

            Health Minister Fahrettin Koca posted a video of a young girl in a navy blue jumper who was found alive. “There is always hope!” he tweeted.

            Rescuers in Antakya, elsewhere in Hatay province, pulled a man in his late 20s or 30s from the rubble, saying he was one of nine trapped in the building. He waved weakly as he was removed on a stretcher as workers applauded and chanted, “God is great!”

            German and Turkish workers rescued an 88-year-old in Kirikhan, German news agency dpa reported. Italian and Turkish rescuers found a 35-year-old man in Antakya who appeared unscathed, private NTV television reported.

            A child was freed overnight in the town of Nizip, in Gaziantep, state-run Anadolu Agency said, while a 32-year woman was found in a wrecked eight-story building in Antakya and asked for tea when she emerged, according to NTV.

            Those were the rare exceptions. 

            Backhoes and bulldozers prepared a large cemetery in Antakya’s outskirts as trucks and ambulances brought a steady stream of black body bags. Hundreds of graves were marked with simple wooden planks.

            Hatay’s airport reopened Sunday after its runway was repaired, and military and commercial planes ferried in supplies and will take away evacuees.

            There are 34,717 Turkish personnel involved in rescue efforts. On Sunday, Turkey's Foreign Ministry said they were joined by 9,595 personnel from 74 countries, with more on the way.

            In the Syrian capital of Damascus, the head of the World Health Organization warned that the pain will ripple forward, calling the disaster an “unfolding tragedy that’s affecting millions.”

            “The compounding crises of conflict, COVID, cholera, economic decline, and now the earthquake have taken an unbearable toll,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.

            Tedros said WHO experts were waiting to enter northwestern Syria “where we have been told the impact is even worse.”

            U.N. Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Martin Griffiths, visiting the Turkish-Syrian border Sunday, said Syrians are “looking for international help that hasn’t arrived.”

            “We have so far failed the people in northwest Syria. They rightly feel abandoned,” he said, adding, “My duty and our obligation is to correct this failure as fast as we can.”

            In the town of Atareb, in opposition-run northern Aleppo province, Abdel-Haseeb Abdel-Raheem returned Sunday to his ruined four-story building to try to salvage any valuables but could find only blankets, pillows and some clothes. His aunt and her husband died there, but their three children survived.

            With no international rescue efforts in the war-battered region, the 34-year-old had to recover the bodies himself.

            “You can’t hear someone inside screaming and sit tight. You can’t sit still. You can’t have the heart to hear someone (crying for help) and you do nothing,” he said, sitting above a mound of debris.

            Political disputes have held up aid convoys sent from areas of northeast Syria controlled by U.S.-backed Kurdish groups to those controlled by the Syrian government and by Turkish-backed rebels who have fought with the Kurdish groups over the years.

            A U.N. aid convoy sent to northwestern Syria through government-held areas was postponed due to obstruction from Hay’at Tahrir al Sham, an al-Qaida affiliated group ruling Idlib province, a U.N. spokesperson told The Associated Press.

            Meanwhile, U.N. aid convoys continue to cross from Turkey into northwestern Syria through the Bab al-Hawa border crossing. The first U.N. convoy only reached northwest Syria from Turkey on Thursday, three days after the disaster struck.

            Before that, it was only a steady stream of bodies coming through Bab al-Hawa: Syrian refugees who had fled the civil war and settled in Turkey but died in the disaster, being returned home for burial.

            The earthquake death toll in Syria’s northwestern rebel-held region has reached 2,166, according to the rescue group the White Helmets. The overall death toll in Syria stood at 3,553 on Saturday, although the 1,387 deaths reported for government-held parts of the country hadn’t been updated in days. Turkey’s death toll was 29,605 as of Sunday. 

            Turkey’s Justice Ministry announced the establishment of Earthquake Crimes Investigation bureaus to identify contractors and others responsible for building works. It would gather evidence; instruct experts including architects, geologists and engineers; and check building permits and occupation permits.

            A contractor was detained Friday at Istanbul airport before he could leave the country. He built a luxury 12-story building called Ronesans Rezidans in Antakya, and when it fell, it killed an untold number. He was formally arrested Saturday.

            In leaked testimony published by Anadolu, the man said the building followed regulations and he did not know why it didn't stay standing. His lawyer suggested his client was a scapegoat.

            Under programs that allowed building owners to pay fines instead of bringing them up to code, the government agency responsible for enforcement acknowledged in 2019 that over half of all buildings in Turkey — accounting for some 13 million apartments— were not in compliance. 

            The detentions could help direct public anger toward builders and contractors, deflecting it from local and state officials who allowed apparently substandard construction to proceed. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s government, already burdened by an economic downturn and high inflation, faces parliamentary and presidential elections in May.

            The nongovernmental business organization TURKONFED estimated the earthquake damage at $84.1 billion, based on statistics from the devastating 1999 quake in northwestern Turkey, including $70.1 billion in housing and $10.4 billion to gross domestic product.

            Rescue crews have been overwhelmed by the widespread damage that has affected roads and airports, making it even harder to move quickly.

            Erdogan acknowledged the initial response was hampered by the damage, with the worst-affected area 500 kilometers (310 miles) in diameter and home to 13.5 million. During a tour Saturday, Erdogan said such a tragedy was rare, referring to it as the “disaster of the century” in multiple speeches.

            In New York City, mourners gathered Saturday at a mosque to remember a family of four from the borough of Queens who were killed while visiting relatives in Turkey. The Council on American-Islamic Relations said Burak and Kimberly Firik and their sons, aged 1 and 2, died in the disaster.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808085,Relegation-fighting Southampton fires manager Nathan Jones,"SOUTHAMPTON, England (AP) — Southampton fired manager Nathan Jones on Sunday after a 2-1 loss to Wolverhampton a day earlier that left the team in last place in the Premier League.

            Fans called for Jones to be sacked as Southampton conceded two late goals against an opponent playing with 10 men for more than an hour.

            The club made the announcement barely three months after Jones took charge as the replacement for Ralph Hasenhuttl.











            “Southampton Football Club can confirm it has parted company with Men’s First Team Manager Nathan Jones,” the club said. 

            Jones' first team coaches Chris Cohen and Alan Sheehan have also departed.

            Southampton lost seven of its eight league games under Jones, whose best results have come in the domestic cups. Southampton reached the English League Cup semifinals after beating Manchester City in the quarterfinals.

            Jones headed straight down the tunnel after Saturday's loss, with his team roundly jeered by fans. 

            “I have never done that in my life before,” he said afterwards. “In terms of 390 games, I have never done that, but I am not sure if me going round clapping would have shown respect.”

            Southampton said coach Rubén Sellés would take charge of training and preparations ahead of its game against Chelsea next weekend.

            The club is now looking for its third manager this season in the hope that its next appointment will be able to steer it to Premier League safety.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808108,DW Jazz Concerts: Richie Beirach and the Sirius Quartet,"More often than not, musicians experiment with different kinds of music, blurring the lines between classical, jazz, pop, rock and other ethnic and traditional musical genres. So if a jazz musician plays classical music, what distinguishes both genres?US jazz pianist Richie Beirach, who plays with the Sirius Quartet in this program, has an answer: ""Jazz is the essence of what is improvised, with passion, energy and great sentiment. And classical music is written and has the same goals: to be great music. And all the great composers were known to be great improvisers, Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Liszt."" Beirach spoke to DW on the sidelines of the 2021 Jazzfest in Bonn.And true to what Beirach says,  we'll be listening to improvised versions of Bach, Beethoven and the Spanish composer Federico Mompou in this episode.Beirach is a pianist, composer, author and teacher who currently lives in Germany, but is originally from New York. According to his own bio on his website, he was born in 1947 and began learning to play the piano when he was just five years old.In 1967, he enrolled at the Berklee College of Music in Boston, but returned to New York after a year, choosing to pursue a master's degree in music at the Manhattan School of Music. In the following years, he played with jazz legends like saxophonists Stan Getz, Dave Liebman and Chet Baker, and jazz guitarists John Scofield and John Abercrombie.Beirach released his first album in 1976. It was called ""Eon,"" a composition he created together with drummer Eliot Zigmund and bassist Frank Tusa. His first solo album, titled ""Hubris,"" was released a year later.In the next decade, Beirach focused more on playing the solo piano and with Dave Liebman for their band, Quest, which they formed in 1981. Their recorded albums include ""Quest,"" ""Midpoint: Live at the Montmartre"" and ""Natural Selection.""In recent times, the artist has focused more on improvising classical music pieces, which he does with aplomb together with musicians Gregor Hübner and bassist George Mraz.Violinist Gregor Hübner also features in this program, as part of the Sirius Quartet, which also includes fellow violinist Fung Chern Hwei, Ron Lawrence on the viola and Jeremy Harman on the cello. The group says on its website that it prides itself on ""pushing beyond the conventional vocabulary of string instruments by incorporating popular song forms"" and using extended techniques and improvisations to create contemporary grooves.Here's a quick run-up of what you'll be hearing in this program, which was recorded at the 2021 Jazzfest Bonn.Coming up first is a track called ""Es ist genug,"" based on a work by 18th-century German composer, Johann Sebastian Bach.That is followed by two more examples of Beirach and the Sirius Quartet's musical innovations. First, we'll listen to the ""Beat Beethoven Project,"" which was originally planned for the Beethoven year in Bonn in 2020 and takes its cue from a composition by the maestro. The second composition you'll hear is called ""Paths Become Lines,"" composed by the Quartet's cellist, Jeremy Harman.Next, we take a trip to Spain and listen to an improvised piece by Federico Mompou. Mompou was born in Barcelona in 1893 and died in 1987. For the following composition, the musicians use two pieces from ""Musica Callada"" and one from ""Impresiones Intimas.""From Spain, we take a trip to the US, to the land of a great jazz legend. We'll listen to Beirach and the Sirius Quartet playing John Coltrane's ""Transitions."" The album was released in 1970, after the saxophonist, tenor and composer's death. Coltrane's wide knowledge of different kinds of music and his studies in classical music, world music and Indian classical music traditions make him an obvious choice for Richie Beirach and the Sirius Quartet's repertoire.In the next section, we go back to classical music and listen to two compositions, ""Andantino,"" by the Tbilisi-born Soviet composer, Aram Khachaturian. The composer was a contemporary of Sergei Prokofiev and Dmitri Shostakovich, both of whom were denounced by the Soviet regime for their music that was at odds with official policy. Khachaturian, on the other hand, seems to have left a mixed legacy and has also been quoted as being thankful to the Soviet leadership for helping him create good music.The next piece is called ""Drei Bagatellen,"" by Hungarian composer Bela Bartok. According to Sirius Quartet's Gregor Huebner, the music is a selection from the 14 ""Bagatelles"" that the composer wrote for piano. The last composition for this episode is by Richie Beirach and is called ""Rectilinear.""That's all in this edition of DW Jazzfest hosted by Manasi Gopalakrishnan. The show was produced by Thomas Schmidt and Christian Stäter, and with editorial support from Anastassia Boutsko.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808109,Ukraine updates: Russia likely suffering highest rate of casualties since start of war — UK intelligence,"Over the last two weeks, Russia has likely suffered its highest rate of casualties since the first week of the war in Ukraine, Britain's defense ministry said on Sunday.""The Ukrainian General Staff release daily statistics on Russian casualties. Although Defense Intelligence cannot verify Ukraine's methodology, the trends the data illustrate are likely accurate. The mean average for the last seven days was 824 casualties per day, over four times the rate reported over June-July 2022,"" the ministry said in a statement published on Twitter.Ukraine also continues to suffer a high attrition rate, it added.The statement went on to say that the uptick in Russian casualties was likely due to various factors including ""lack of trained personnel, coordination and resources across the front,"" adding that this was exemplified in Vuhledar and Bakhmut.""Here are some of the other notable developments concerning the war in Ukraine on Sunday, February 12.German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser argues that Europe should better coordinate the distribution of Ukrainian refugees across countries.Faeser made the comments in an interview for Germany's Bild am Sonntag newspaper.""Poland has so far taken in more than 1.5 million Ukrainian refugees, Spain 160,000,"" said Faeser. ""It can't remain that way.""Yevgeny Prigozhin, founder of the Wagner mercenary group, says that the force has taken the village of Krasna Hora near the city of Bakhmut.""Today the settlement of Krasna Hora was taken by the assault troops of the Wagner private military company,"" Prigozhin said in an audio message published on Telegram.He also posted a video that appeared to show Wagner fighters at the entrance sign to Krasna Hora.The Reuters news agency said it could not independently verify the claim.US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov held talks on ""priorities"", including air defense and artillery, for the forthcoming meetings of Ukraine's allies in Brussels, the two sides said late Saturday.Austin and Reznikov discussed the importance of delivering promised capabilities as quickly as possible, a statement from the Pentagon's chief spokesperson, Brigadier General Patrick Ryder, said.Following the call, the Ukrainian Defense Minister said on Twitter that ""the United States is unwavering in its support of Ukraine.""Reznikov added that the situation on the frontline was also discussed.Ukrainian forces are holding along the frontline in Donetsk, including that of the beleaguered town of Bakhmut, as battles rage on for the the cities of Vuhledar and Maryinka, Kyiv's top military commander has said.According to Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, commander-in-chief of Ukraine's Armed Forces, Russia carries out nearly 50 attacks daily in the southeastern region of Donetsk.""Fierce fighting continues in the area of Vuhledar and Maryinka,"" Zaluzhnyi said in a Telegram message on Saturday.""We reliably hold the defense. In some areas of the front we have managed to regain previously lost positions and gained a foothold.""However, he did not provide details on where gains were taking place.He said that Kyiv's forces continue to hold Bakhmut and are trying to ""stabilize"" the frontline around the town.Three big regions can avoid power cuts after a Russian strike, says Ukraine.Three major Ukrainian regions and the capital Kyiv will be able to avoid electricity cuts on Sunday, leading producer DTEK said as authorities worked to repair power grids damaged during a major Russian attack.DTEK said that grid operator Ukrenergo had not imposed any additional curbs on consumption on Sunday, which meant there should be no power cuts in Kyiv and the surrounding region as well as the regions of Odesa and Dnipro.Russia's defense ministry had said in a statement that its forces had conducted a ""massive strike"" on crucial energy facilities of Ukraine's military-industrial complex on Friday.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has issued a decree sacking Ruslan Dziuba as deputy commander of the National Guard.The decree did not specify any reasons for the top security official's discharge.Saturday's move is the latest among dismissals of dozens of officials in the last few weeks as authorities have opened investigations as part of a massive drive against wrongdoing.According to the European Union, addressing corruption is a prerequisite for Ukraine joining the 27-nation bloc.On Saturday, Zelenskyy said in a separate statement that his drive to clean up the government would continue.dvv,sdi/kb (Reuters, AP)",2023/02/12,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808110,Turkey-Syria earthquakes: UN fears death toll could double,"Rescuers in Turkey have pulled more people from the rubble of Monday's earthquakes, but hopes were fading in Turkey and Syria that many more survivors would be found.UN relief chief Martin Griffiths has said he expects the death toll to at least double, after he arrived in southern Turkey on Saturday to assess the quake's damage.With a death toll of at least 24,517 in Turkey, the disaster is already in the list of the top 10 deadliest earthquakes ever. More than 3,500 have died in Syria, where death tolls have not been updated since Friday.Between Monday and Saturday, the area experienced more than 2,000 aftershocks, according to Turkey's AFAD disaster authority.Here are other updates from Sunday, February 12, on the aftermath of the deadly earthquakes:Turkish officials ordered the detention of 113 suspects allegedly involved in constructing some of the buildings that collapsed during the earthquakes.Vice President Fuat Oktay said overnight that 131 suspects had been identified, and ""detention orders have been issued for 113 of them.""Environment Minister Murat Kurum said at least 24,921 buildings across the region had collapsed or were heavily damaged.Turkey's construction codes meet current earthquake-engineering standards but is not always enforced.Authorities at Istanbul Airport on Sunday detained two contractors held responsible for the destruction of several buildings in Adiyaman, Turkish media reported. The pair were reportedly on their way to Georgia.The state-run Anadolu Agency said that two more people were arrested in the province of Gaziantep suspected of having cut down columns to make extra room in a building that collapsed.The detentions could help direct public anger toward builders and contractors, deflecting attention away from local and state officials who allowed sub-standard constructions.Greece's foreign minister, Nikos Dendias, his visiting quake-hit areas neighboring Turkey in a show of support.He was met at the airport by his Turkish counterpart, Mevlut Cavusoglu before they flew to Antakya, where Greek rescuers are helping with search and rescue operations.Despite a history of rivalry with Turkey, Greece was among the first European countries to send rescue workers and humanitarian aid a few hours after the disaster.The Greek government has sent 80 tonnes of medical and first aid equipment.According to the foreign ministry, Dendias and Cavusoglu will discuss ways Greece can further assist Turkey.A German expert and relief worker has warned that the danger of disease is growing in quake-struck areas.""In regions where people have no access to clean drinking water, there is a risk of epidemics at some point,"" said Thomas Geiner, a doctor with earthquake experience who is part of a rescue team from Germany's NAVIS aid organization said.Bodies trapped under rubble could contaminate the water supply, he warned. The lack of toilets was also a concern.A Turkish rescuer, who did not provide her full name, described the situation in Antakya as desperate.""The bodies are all over the roads, with only blankets on them,"" she said.People in the town were wearing masks to cover the smell of death.Germany's Foreign and Interior ministries have announced plans to enable Turkish quake survivors who have relatives in Germany to temporarily stay with them.The two ministries have set up a task force to fast-track the paperwork and reduce the necessary bureaucracy.""The goal is to make the visa process for these cases as unbureaucratic as possible,"" said Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock.Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said this would be done with regular visas, which would be swiftly issued and remain valid for three months.""We want to make it possible for Turkish or Syrian families in Germany to bring close relatives from the disaster region to join them without red tape,"" Faeser wrote on Twitter.Germany is home to the largest Turkish community outside of Turkey.The European Union's envoy to Syria has urged Damascus not to politicize issues of humanitarian aid, rejecting accusations that the bloc had failed to provide sufficient help to Syrians.""It is absolutely unfair to be accused of not providing aid, when actually we have constantly been doing exactly that for over a decade and we are doing so much more even during the earthquake crisis,"" Dan Stoenescu told the Reuters news agency.He said the EU had gathered more than €50 million ($53 million) to provide aid and back rescue missions and first aid in both government-held and rebel-controlled parts of Syria.A 30-ton shipment of humanitarian aid from the Italian government — including four ambulances and 13 pallets of medical equipment — landed in Beirut on Saturday en route to Damascus.The first shipment of earthquake-related aid crossed from Turkey into Syria's rebel-held enclave on Friday.Humanitarian access to northern Syria is complicated by the civil war, while sending funds can be blocked or slowed by sanctions, despite an exemption for relief efforts.lo/kb (AFP, AP, dpa, Reuters)",2023/02/12,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808111,Russia continues to shell Ukraine amid grinding push in east,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russian forces over the weekend continued to shell Ukrainian cities amid a grinding push to seize more land in the east of the country, with Ukrainian officials saying that Moscow is having trouble launching its much-anticipated large-scale offensive there. 

            One person was killed and one more was wounded on Sunday morning by the shelling of Nikopol, a city in the southeastern Dnipropetrovsk region, Gov. Serhii Lysak reported. The shelling damaged four residential buildings, a vocational school and a water treatment facility. 

            In Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city, one person was wounded after three Russian S-300 missiles hit infrastructure facilities overnight, regional Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said. The Russian military said they hit armored vehicle assembly workshops at the Malyshev machinery plant in the city.











            Ukrainian forces also downed five drones — four Shahed killer drones and one Orlan-10 reconnaissance drone — over the partially occupied Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk regions on Saturday evening, Kyiv's military reported.

            Overall, Russian forces carried out 12 missile and 32 air strikes in Ukraine over the past 24 hours, as well as over 90 rounds of shelling from multiple rocket launchers, Ukraine's General Staff reported in its daily update. 

            The attacks come as Russian forces push to take over more land in the eastern industrial heartland of Donbas, comprised of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Ukrainian and Western officials have warned that Russia could launch a new, broad offensive there to try to turn the tide of the conflict as the war approaches the one-year mark.

            But Ukrainian officials say that Moscow is having trouble mounting such an offensive. 

            “They are having big problems with a big offensive,” Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, told Ukrainian television on Saturday night. 

            “They have begun their offensive, they're just not saying they have, and our troops are repelling it very powerfully. The offensive that they planned is already gradually underway. But (it is) not the offensive they were counting on,” Danilov said. 

            A U.S.-based think tank noted that it is also Russia’s pro-Kremlin military bloggers who question Moscow’s ability to launch a broad offensive in Ukraine. They “continue to appear demoralized at the Kremlin’s prospects for executing a major offensive,” the Institute for the Study of War said in its latest report.

            Earlier this week the owner of the Russian Wagner Group private military contractor actively involved in the fighting in Ukraine said that the war could drag on for years.

            Yevgeny Prigozhin said in a video interview released late Friday that it could take 18 months to two years for Russia to fully secure control of Donbas. He added that the war could go on for three years if Moscow decides to capture broader territories east of the Dnieper River.

            The statement from Prigozhin, a millionaire who has close links to Russian President Vladimir Putin and was dubbed “Putin’s chef” for his lucrative Kremlin catering contracts, marked a recognition of the difficulties that the Kremlin has faced in the campaign, which it initially expected to wrap up within weeks when Russian troops invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24.

            Russia suffered a series of humiliating setbacks in the fall when the Ukrainian military launched successful counteroffensives to reclaim broad swaths of territory in the east and the south. 

            On Sunday, Prigozhin said that Wagner fighters have taken over the Krasna Hora settlement north of Bakhmut, a strategic city at the epicenter of the fighting in recent months.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808117,Earthquake diplomacy: Greek foreign minister  visits Turkey,"ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Greek foreign minister Nikos Dendias visited the earthquake-stricken areas of Turkey Sunday, accompanied by his Turkish counterpart, Mevlut Cavusoglu.

            The visit was part of a new round of so-called “earthquake diplomacy” between the two uneasy allies, whose relations have often been frosty, if not downright hostile. Something similar happened in 1999, three years after the two countries almost went to war over two uninhabited islets in the Aegean Sea.

            In August 1999, a 7.6 magnitude tremor had struck Turkey, resulting in about 18,000 dead; the following month, a 6.0-magnitude earthquake struck the Greek, capital, Athens, killing 143 people. In both cases, the two countries sent rescuers to assist in each other's efforts. The warming of bilateral relations had been widely covered in the international media.











            Cavusoglu recalled a letter that he, as a private citizen, had sent to TIME magazine at the time.

            “Back then, I said that we should not wait for another earthquake to improve our relations. I repeat this now, as Turkey's foreign minister. We must make efforts to improve our relations,” Cavusoglu said.

            “I want to totally sign on on to what Mevlut said: that we should not wait for natural disasters to improve our relations,” Dendias said later.

            The two countries are at odds over research for natural resources in the Aegean and the Eastern Mediterranean. Turkey has also accused Greece of militarizing some Aegean islands, in violation of international treaties, a charge Greece has strongly denied. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has often threatened Greece that Tukish troops will come ""suddenly one night,” and has mentioned that Turkey's new Tayfun missiles can reach Athens.

            Such rhetoric has, at least for the moment, been put aside. Erdogan has spoken on the phone with Greece's President Katerina Sakellaropoulou and Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, with whom he had had declared he would not speak ever again. The two Greek officials called Erdogan to express their condolences for the earthquake's victims and assure him of Greek support.

            Publicly, and on social media, Greek people have expressed their support for Turkey, except for some on the far nationalist fringe. Greek unions have taken the lead in collecting aid for the displaced. At all sports events held on Saturday, a minute of silence was observed for the victims.

            Cavusoglu and Dendias visited the Operations Centre in Antakya, where they were briefed on the latest developments concerning the evacuation and rescue effort, as well as on the humanitarian needs that have arisen. They also saw the extent of the devastation from the air, in a helicopter trip.

            Dendias and Cavusoglu also visited the camp where Greek and other international units, units are based. Rescuers from EU countries have pulled a total of 205 survivors from the ruins, Dendias said in a joint appearance with Cavusoglu.

            “The Greek effort will not stop here.,” Dendias said. “Greece will do everything to support Turkey, either bilaterally or as a member of the European Union.”

            Cavusoglu especially thanked the Greek rescuers for their “superhuman efforts, round the clock, for the past week.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808130,Whistleblowers accuse nonprofit of mishandling donations for Taiwan soldier killed in Ukraine,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Controversy has arisen over how a nonprofit operated a donation drive in the name of Tseng Sheng-kuang (曾聖光), a Taiwanese Indigenous man who died in November while fighting for Ukraine after whistleblowers accused the group of misusing funds raised for Tseng's funeral.A Facebook account under the name of Hsu Mei-hua (許美華) posted on Friday (Feb. 10) that anonymous whistleblowers stated that the Taiwan-Reyhanli Center for World Citizens (Taiwan Center), a Taiwan-funded civic organization in Turkey, had hosted a donation drive to raise funds for Tseng on behalf of his family, reactivated the drive and pocketed the money.When the amount accumulated was enough for the funeral, Tseng's family asked the association to end the fundraiser, but Taiwan Center Director Chiu Chen-yu (裘振宇) refused and threatened the family, claiming they were violating an agreement, which would have serious legal consequences for them, according to the post.After the drive ended, the center activated it again, which was not commissioned by Tseng’s family, who the whistleblowers also said had not received any additional donations after the initial donation drive concluded.In response to the accusation, the Taiwan Center posted a long statement on Facebook on Saturday (Feb. 11). The center said that after Tseng died on the battlefield, Tseng’s family contacted Chiu, hoping he would hold a fundraiser for Tseng’s funeral. After discussion, the family agreed that the fundraising campaign would be hosted by another association, which was chaired by Chiu at the time.The Taiwan Center claimed that it had absorbed all the manpower costs during the campaign, had not taken a penny, and even paid for advertisements for the fund out of its own pocket.After the fundraiser began, donations poured in, and the association concluded the campaign on Nov. 25 via Facebook post in accordance with the agreement signed by the two parties. The center said it counted all the donations in the next four days and gave Tseng’s family all the money it received on Nov. 30.The Taiwan Center said that some people had asked to make donations after the campaign ended, but the association had declined to accept. The center denied that it had reactivated the donation drive after the initial campaign ended.However, Hsu Mei-hua rebutted the Taiwan Center’s statement in another Facebook post on Sunday, saying that the association reactivated the donation campaign system without telling Tseng’s family and that the association received many donations in January. The post presented evidence of a donation of NT$30,000 (US$990) made on Jan. 10, after the fund drive had allegedly already ended, by someone surnamed Kuo (郭).The author behind the post hopes Chiu makes a public apology, or “I will make more evidence public to prove that the association reactivated the online donation system.”Taiwan Center Director Chiu Chen-yu.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808136,Grief gives way to anger over Turkey's earthquake response,"ANTAKYA, Turkey (AP) — When Zafer Mahmut Boncuk's apartment building collapsed in Turkey's devastating earthquake, he discovered his 75-year-old mother was still alive — but pinned under the wreckage.

            For hours, Boncuk frantically searched for someone in the ancient, devastated city of Antakya to help him free her. He was able to talk to her, hold her hand and give her water. Despite his pleas, however, no one came, and she died on Tuesday, the day after the quake.

            Like many others in Turkey, his sorrow and disbelief have turned to rage over the sense there has been an unfair and ineffective response to the historic disaster that has killed tens of thousands of people there and in Syria.











            Boncuk directed his anger at President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, especially because she seemed so close to rescue but no one came. Her remains were finally removed Sunday, nearly a week after the building collapsed. His father's body is still in the rubble.

            “What would happen if it was your own mother, dear Recep Tayyip Erdogan? What happened to being a world leader? Where are you? Where?” he screamed.

            “I gave her water to drink, I cleared her face of rubble. I told her that I would save her. But I failed,” said Boncuk, 60. “The last time we spoke, I asked if I should help her drink some water. She said no, so I rubbed some water on her lips. Ten minutes later, she died.”

            He blamed “ignorance and lack of information and care — that’s why my mother died in front of my eyes.”

            Many in Turkey express similar frustration that rescue operations have been painfully slow since the Feb. 6 quakes and that valuable time was lost during the narrow window for finding people alive.

            Others, particularly in southern Hatay province near the Syrian border, say Erdogan’s government was late in delivering assistance to the hardest-hit region for what they suspect are both political and religious reasons.

            In the southeastern town of Adiyaman, Elif Busra Ozturk waited outside the wreckage of a building on Saturday where her uncle and aunt were trapped and believed dead, and where the bodies of two of her cousins already had been found.

            “For three days, I waited outside for help. No one came. There were so few rescue teams that they could only intervene in places they were sure there were people alive,” she said.

            At the same complex, Abdullah Tas, 66, said he had been sleeping in a car near the building where his son, daughter-in-law and four grandchildren were buried. He said that rescuers had first arrived four days after the earthquake struck. The Associated Press could not independently verify his claim.

            “What good is that for the people under the debris?” he asked.

            Onlookers stood behind police tape Saturday in Antakya as bulldozers clawed at a high-rise luxury apartment building that had toppled onto its side.

            Over 1,000 residents had been in the 12-story building when the quake struck, according to relatives watching the recovery effort. They said hundreds were still inside but complained the effort to free them had been slow and not serious.

            “This is an atrocity, I don’t know what to say,” said Bediha Kanmaz, 60. The bodies of her son and 7-month-old grandson had been pulled from the building — still locked in an embrace — but her daughter-in-law was still inside.

            “We open body bags to see if they’re ours, we’re checking if they’re our children. We’re even checking the ones that are torn to pieces,” she said of herself and other grief-stricken relatives.

            Kanmaz also blamed Turkey’s government for the slow response, and accused the national rescue service of failing to do enough to recover people alive.

            She and others in Antakya expressed the belief that the presence of a large minority of Alevis — an Anatolian Islamic community that differs from Sunni and Shia Islam and Alawites in Syria — had made them a low priority for the government. Traditionally, few Alevis vote for Erdogan’s ruling party. There was no evidence, however, that the region was overlooked for sectarian reasons.

            Erdogan said Wednesday that disaster efforts were continuing in all 10 affected provinces and dismissed allegations of no help from state institutions like the military as “lies, fake slander.” 

            But he has acknowledged shortcomings. Officials said rescue efforts in Hatay were initially complicated by the destruction of the local airport’s runway and bad road conditions.

            Anger over the extent of the destruction, however, is not limited to individuals. Turkish authorities have been detaining or issuing detention warrants for dozens of people allegedly involved in the construction of buildings that collapsed, and the justice minister has vowed to punish those responsible.

            Kanmaz blamed negligence on the part of the developer of the apartment building where her family had been killed. 

            “If I could wrap my hands around the contractor’s neck, I would tear him to shreds,” she said.

            That contractor, who oversaw the construction of the 250-unit building, was detained at Istanbul Airport on Friday before boarding a flight out of the country, Turkey’s official Anadolu news agency reported. On Saturday, he was formally arrested. His lawyer suggested the public was looking for a scapegoat.

            In multiethnic southern Turkey, other tensions are rising. Some expressed frustration that Syrian refugees who fled to the region from their devastating civil war are burdening the sparse welfare system and competing for resources with Turkish people.

            “There are many poor people in Hatay, but they don’t offer us any welfare; they give it to the Syrians. They give so much to the Syrians,” Kanmaz said. “There are more Syrians than Turks here.”

            There were signs Saturday the tensions could be boiling over. 

            Two German aid groups and the Austrian Armed Forces temporarily interrupted their rescue work in the Hatay region citing fears for the safety of their staff. They resumed work after the Turkish army secured the area, the Austrian Defense Ministry spokesman tweeted.

            “There is increasing tension between different groups in Turkey,” Lt. Col. Pierre Kugelweis of the Austrian Armed Forces told the APA news agency. “Shots have reportedly been fired.”

            German news agency dpa reported that Steven Berger, chief of operations of the aid group I.S.A.R. Germany, said that “it can be seen that grief is slowly giving way to anger” in Turkey’s affected regions.

            For Kanmaz, it was a mixture of grief and anger.

            “I’m angry. Life is over,” she said. “We live for our children; what matters most to us is our children. We exist if they exist. Now we are over. Everything you see here is over.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808138,Odermatt draws Federer comparison after downhill gold,"COURCHEVEL, France (AP) — Competing with an elegance that makes the sport look easy. Technically brilliant. Highly successful. Humble. And Swiss.

            
                Marco Odermatt has plenty in common with Roger Federer.

            The smooth and fluent run that earned Odermatt gold in the men’s downhill at the Alpine skiing world championships by a large margin on Sunday prompted French veteran Johan Clarey to label him the Roger Federer of skiing.











            “Roger did way bigger things then I do,” Odermatt said. ”(But) like Roger, for me it’s very important to be a humble guy. To not just kill for the victory, to have big respect for all the other athletes. And I think this is what Roger (did).”

            Big mutual respect can also characterize the season-long rivalry between Odermatt and Aleksander Aamodt Kilde of Norway.

            “It’s easy. If a guy is faster, you just have to respect it, then congratulate,” Odermatt said.

            On Sunday, Kilde finished 0.48 behind Odermatt to collect another silver after also finishing second in super-G.

            “It's a fun battle,"" the Norwegian said. “It’s fun because we are so (nice) and we are humble, decent people. We’re trying to do it in a good way. Fighting against Odermatt is always a joy. It brings a smile on my face more than anything. So that’s cool.”

            Kilde, the pre-race favorite who won five World Cup downhills this season, smiled and hugged Odermatt in the finish area after being beaten.

            “When someone delivers a run like Odermatt did today, then it’s just hats off and just respect it,” Kilde said.

            Watched by 13,000 spectators, lots of them waving Swiss flags, ringing cow bells, and blowing air horns, Odermatt ended his four-year wait for a world championship medal in impressive style and let out a few screams after posting the fastest time.

            “It was definitely something I’d never felt before, this scream at the finish,” said Odermatt. “Also, those two minutes during Alex's run, I was shaking all over my body like never before.”

            Cameron Alexander finished 0.89 behind to take the bronze for Canada’s second medal of the worlds after teammate James Crawford won the super-G.

            Odermatt had not won a medal in eight previous starts at senior world championships, after winning five golds at the 2018 junior worlds.

            He had also never won a top-level downhill before, though he has finished runner-up in seven World Cup races.

            “I knew something was possible but that it works like this is unbelievable,"" said Odermatt, who won Olympic gold in giant slalom a year ago.

            Odermatt is the defending overall World Cup champion and is dominating the circuit again this season. His gold medal came three days after he finished fourth in the super-G, an event in which he was heavily favored after winning four of this season's six World Cup races.

            “The fourth place from three days ago makes this gold even nicer,” Odermatt said, adding that he “went all-in” on what was a risky but smooth and fluent run from top to bottom.

            Kilde, who leads the World Cup downhill standings after winning five races this season, led Odermatt by 0.20 seconds at the first split but lost time on his Swiss rival once he entered the shady part of the course.

            “A couple of turns I messed up a bit, on the top and in the middle,"" Kilde said. “I tried to charge, nearly nailed it. I gave it a battle and I’m happy with that.”

            The Norwegian praised Odermatt for his “mental strength.”

            “He comes from a fourth place in Super-G, which for the whole Swiss community was a disaster,"" Kilde said. “He’s an amazing athlete and he does great skiing.” 

            The start of the L’Eclipse course was bathed in bright sunshine, but racers soon entered a lengthy shaded middle section through a forest before coming out into the sun again for the finish.

            Odermatt’s victory made it a Swiss downhill double after teammate Jasmine Flury won the women’s downhill Saturday.

            Crawford stood third for a while before his time was beaten by Alexander and by Austria’s Marco Schwarz, who finished four-hundredths of a second off the podium in fourth.

            Alexander was competing in his first race at a major championship.

            “Just pushing and feeling like I was hanging on a bit,” he said. “When you’re fighting and hanging on in downhill, usually it means you’re going fast. I had a couple of mistakes but they weren’t too costly.”

            Crawford, who finished fifth, said he was “not surprised at all” with his teammate’s performance.

            “Cam, he’s always had the speed, he has battled through some unfortunate injuries that have kind of sidelined him for a little while,” Crawford said. “His speed and ability is right up there with me and the other guys on our team.”

            It’s the first time since 2015 that the Austrian men’s team failed to medal in the marquee event of the world championships.

            
                Defending champion Vincent Kriechmayr lost his chance at a medal when he struggled in the Trou Noir (Black Hole) midway down, where racers land a jump amid dark shade and cannot see the tracks and bumps of the course.

            “It was a good run but you have to race error-free here, and I didn’t manage to do that. All in all, just not good enough,” Kriechmayr said. “Odermatt had the perfect run, for sure.”

            The race was interrupted for 20 minutes after Brodie Seger awkwardly landed a jump and appeared to injure his right knee. The Canadian had to be taken off the hill on a stretcher.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808139,Arab leaders warn Israeli actions threaten regional turmoil,"CAIRO (AP) — Dozens of leaders and senior officials from Arab and Islamic countries warned on Sunday Israeli actions in Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank could worsen regional turmoil, as violence surges between Israel and the Palestinians.

            The meeting in Cairo was hosted by the Arab League and attended by President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi of Egypt, Jordan’s King Abdullah II and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas along with many foreign ministers and senior officials.

            The high-level gathering came amid one of the deadliest periods of fighting in years in Jerusalem and the neighboring Israeli-occupied territory. Forty-five Palestinians have been killed so far this year, according to a count by The Associated Press. Palestinians have killed 10 people on the Israeli side during that time.











            Speakers at the meeting condemned Israel’s “unilateral measures” in Jerusalem and the West Bank in statements, including home demolitions and expanding settlements.

            They also condemned visits by Israeli officials to the city’s contested holy site, which is sacred to both Jews and Muslims and has often been the epicenter of Israeli-Palestinian unrest.

            There was no immediate comment from Israel's government.

            The officials also voiced support for Jordan's role as custodian of the Al-Aqsa Mosque, the third-holiest site in Islam. The mosque is built on a hilltop in Jerusalem’s Old City that is the most sacred site for Jews, who refer to it as the Temple Mount because it was the site of the Jewish temples in antiquity.

            Since Israel captured the site in the 1967 Mideast War, Jews have been allowed to visit but not pray there. Israel claims all of Jerusalem as its undivided capital, while the Palestinians seek east Jerusalem as the capital of their future state.

            Calling Jerusalem ""the backbone of the Palestinian cause,"" el-Sissi warned of dire repercussions of any Israeli move to change the status quo of the holy site, saying they would “negatively impact” future negotiations to settle the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

            He said such measures would impede the long-sought after two-state solution to the conflict, which would leave “both parties and the whole Middle East with difficult and grave options.”

            El-Sissi, whose country was the first Arab nation to establish diplomatic ties with Israel, called on the international community to “reinforce the two-state solution and create conducive conditions for the resumption of the peace process.”

            King Abdullah II also called for Israel to cease its violations and incursions into the Al-Aqsa Mosque. 

            “The region cannot live in peace, stability, and prosperity without any progress made on the Palestinian cause,” he warned.

            Ahmed Aboul-Gheit, the secretary-general of the pan-Arab organization, also warned that attempts to partition the Al-Aqsa Mosque and obliterate its Arab and Islamic identity “would fuel endless unrest and violence.”

            Abbas, the Palestinian president, said his administration would resort to the United Nations and its agencies and demand a resolution to protect the two-state solution to the conflict.

            “The State of Palestine will continue going to international courts and organizations to protect our people’s legitimate rights,” he said.

            The ongoing bout of violence has put the region on edge. Last month, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Egyptian, Israeli and Palestinian leaders and urged them to ease tensions.

            Israel is run by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s new far-right government. Many politicians in Netanyahu’s administration oppose Palestinian independence.

            Sunday's meeting in Cairo issued a final statement that condemned what it called “Israeli's systemic policy” that aims at “distorting and changing” Jerusalem’s “Arab and Islamic culture and identity.”

            The communique also urged the International Criminal Court to pursue its investigation and hold those responsible for Israel’s alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity accountable.CAIRO (AP) — Dozens of leaders and senior officials from Arab and Islamic countries warned on Sunday Israeli actions in Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank could worsen regional turmoil, as violence surges between Israel and the Palestinians.The meeting in Cairo was hosted by the Arab League and attended by President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi of Egypt, Jordan’s King Abdullah II and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas along with many foreign ministers and senior officials.The high-level gathering came amid one of the deadliest periods of fighting in years in Jerusalem and the neighboring Israeli-occupied territory. Forty-five Palestinians have been killed so far this year, according to a count by The Associated Press. Palestinians have killed 10 people on the Israeli side during that time.Speakers at the meeting condemned Israel’s “unilateral measures” in Jerusalem and the West Bank in statements, including home demolitions and expanding settlements.They also condemned visits by Israeli officials to the city’s contested holy site, which is sacred to both Jews and Muslims and has often been the epicenter of Israeli-Palestinian unrest.There was no immediate comment from Israel's government.The officials also voiced support for Jordan's role as custodian of the Al-Aqsa Mosque, the third-holiest site in Islam. The mosque is built on a hilltop in Jerusalem’s Old City that is the most sacred site for Jews, who refer to it as the Temple Mount because it was the site of the Jewish temples in antiquity.Since Israel captured the site in the 1967 Mideast War, Jews have been allowed to visit but not pray there. Israel claims all of Jerusalem as its undivided capital, while the Palestinians seek east Jerusalem as the capital of their future state.Calling Jerusalem ""the backbone of the Palestinian cause,"" el-Sissi warned of dire repercussions of any Israeli move to change the status quo of the holy site, saying they would “negatively impact” future negotiations to settle the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.He said such measures would impede the long-sought after two-state solution to the conflict, which would leave “both parties and the whole Middle East with difficult and grave options.”El-Sissi, whose country was the first Arab nation to establish diplomatic ties with Israel, called on the international community to “reinforce the two-state solution and create conducive conditions for the resumption of the peace process.”King Abdullah II also called for Israel to cease its violations and incursions into the Al-Aqsa Mosque.“The region cannot live in peace, stability, and prosperity without any progress made on the Palestinian cause,” he warned.Ahmed Aboul-Gheit, the secretary-general of the pan-Arab organization, also warned that attempts to partition the Al-Aqsa Mosque and obliterate its Arab and Islamic identity “would fuel endless unrest and violence.”Abbas, the Palestinian president, said his administration would resort to the United Nations and its agencies and demand a resolution to protect the two-state solution to the conflict.“The State of Palestine will continue going to international courts and organizations to protect our people’s legitimate rights,” he said.The ongoing bout of violence has put the region on edge.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808150,Germany to ease visa conditions for some earthquake victims,"BERLIN (AP) — The German government wants to temporarily ease visa restrictions for survivors of the earthquake in Turkey and Syria who have close family ties to Germany if they are facing homelessness or were injured.

            “It’s about helping in times of need. We want to make it possible for Turkish or Syrian families in Germany to bring close relatives from the disaster region,” German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser tweeted late Saturday. 

            “They can find shelter with us and receive medical treatment,” Faeser said. “With regular visas, which are issued quickly and are valid for three months.”











            However, not all the requirements of a regular visa procedure are being waived. Applicants must still be able to present a valid passport — likely to be an obstacle for people who fled collapsing buildings.

            Several million people in Germany have Turkish roots because, more than 60 years ago, West Germany recruited “guest workers” from Turkey and elsewhere to help the country advance economically.

            More recently, hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees came to Germany looking for safety from the brutal civil war back home. 

            Turkish and Syrian immigrants in Germany have been collecting aid, sending donations and worrying for their relatives back home. Calls to allow them to take in close family members from the devastated regions had been growing for days.

            The German government said it would ease the normally very strict and bureaucratic visa conditions quickly, adding that the foreign ministry had already both increased its staff in Turkey and redeployed capacity at visa acceptance centers there.

            Earthquake victims who wish to seek refuge in Germany and want to apply for a three-month visa need to prove that they have close family members in Germany who have German citizenship or a permanent right of residence, German news agency dpa reported.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808151,Pope worried about Nicaraguan bishop sentenced to 26 years,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — Pope Francis on Sunday expressed sadness and worry at the news that Bishop Rolando Álvarez, an outspoken critic of the Nicaraguan government, had been sentenced to 26 years in prison. 

             It's just the latest move against the Catholic Church and government opponents, and comes amid growing concern for Álvarez.

            “The news that arrived from Nicaragua has saddened me no little,’’ the pontiff said, expressing both his love and concern at a traditional Sunday gathering in St. Peter’s Square.











            He called on the faithful to pray for the politicians responsible “to open their hearts.” 

            Álvarez was sentenced Friday, after refusing to get on a flight to the United States with 222 other prisoners, all opponents of President Daniel Ortega. In addition to his prison term, Álvarez was stripped of his Nicaraguan citizenship. 

            The bishop said if he boarded the plane, it would be he was admitting he was guilty to a crime he never committed, according to a person close to Álvarez who asked not the be identified out of fear of reprisal.

            ""Let them go and I’ll stay and serve out their sentence,"" he said that Álvarez told him.

            Until now, no one has been able to contact Álvarez, nor confirm for themselves where he is or if he is safe, he said. 

            That concern was also echoed in Nicaragua’s capital, when Cardinal Leopoldo Brenes said someone had asked him what they could do for Álvarez.

            ""Pray, that is our strength,” Brenes told those gathered inside the Metropolitan Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception. “Pray that the Lord gives him strength, gives him judgment in all of his actions.”

            The comments by Pope Francis and Cardinal Brenes on Sunday were the first made publicly by the church about the expulsion of the prisoners — several priests did board the flight — and of Álvarez's sentence.

            Ortega ordered the mass release of political leaders, priests, students and activists widely considered political prisoners and had some of them put on a flight to Washington Thursday. Ortega said Álvarez refused to board without being able to consult with other bishops.

            Nicaragua’s president called Álvarez’s refusal “an absurd thing.” Álvarez, who had been held under house arrest, was then taken to the nearby Modelo prison.

            In the run-up to Ortega's re-election in November 2021, Nicaraguan authorities arrested seven potential opposition presidential candidates to clear the field. The government closed hundreds of nongovernmental organizations that Ortega has accused of taking foreign funding and using it to destabilize his government.

            The former guerrilla fighter has long had a tense relationship with the Catholic Church. But he targeted it more directly last year in his campaign to extinguish voices of dissent. 

            Ortega kicked out the papal nuncio, the Vatican's top diplomat in March. Later, the government shut down several radio stations in Álvarez's Matagalpa diocese ahead of municipal elections. Álvarez was arrested in August along with several other priests and lay people, accused with undermining the government and spreading false information.

            The church's response to the government's increasingly aggressive behavior has been muted, apparently in an attempt to not inflame tensions.

            On Saturday, a few thousand Ortega supporters marched in the capital in a show of support for the expulsion of the opposition prisoners. While some seemed genuine in their support, the government has earned a reputation for turning out people by making government employees attend.

            Outside Managua's cathedral Sunday, it was clear that the lengthy sentence for a priest and stripping critics of their citizenship rankled people in the still heavily Roman Catholic country.

            Jorge Paladino, a 49-year-old architect, said he felt “disillusioned, upset, dismayed.” He said those who were expelled will always be Nicaraguans, regardless of what they are told.

            María Buitrago, a 61-year-old retiree, spoke softly but with indignation. 

            “They took their nationality in a horrible way as if they are gods and can take from someone where they live, where they were born,” Buitrago said. “They can't take Nicaraguan blood. They can't take it. But they do what they please.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808152,"Army sees safety, not 'wokeness,' as top recruiting obstacle","WASHINGTON (AP) — While some Republicans blame the COVID-19 vaccine or “wokeness” for the Army's recruiting woes, the military service says the bigger hurdles are more traditional ones: Young people don’t want to die or get injured, deal with the stress of Army life and put their lives on hold.

            They “just don’t see the Army as something that’s relevant,” said Maj. Gen. Alex Fink, head of Army marketing. “They see us as revered, but not relevant, in their lives.”

            Addressing those longtime issues has taken on greater urgency as the Army tries to recover from its worst recruiting year in decades, a situation aggravated by the tight jobs market. The Army is offering new programs, advertising and enticements in an effort to change perceptions and reverse the decline.











            One incentive gives recruiters bonuses of up to $4,500 per quarter if they exceed their baseline enlistment requirement. A pilot program allows young enlisted soldiers — those in the three lower ranks — to get a promotion if they refer someone who enlists and goes to basic training. Only one promotion per soldier is allowed.

            The Army fell about 15,000 soldiers, or 25%, short of its 60,000 recruitment goal last year, when all the branches struggled to meet recruiting goals.

            
                Army Secretary Christine Wormuth said the Army has set a difficult goal for this year: aiming to bring in 65,000 recruits, which would be 20,000 more than in 2022. It’s difficult to predict how it will go, she said, adding that recruiters need to do all they can to surpass last year’s numbers.

            “I would say it is a stretch goal,” she said.

            
                Wormuth said she and Gen. James McConville, the Army's chief of staff, believed they needed to set a big goal. 

            “I think we are seeing some forward momentum. But it is still too early to tell where we will likely land at the end of this fiscal year. I know we will do better than we did last year,” she said.

            Guiding the Army's efforts are surveys intended to help pinpoint why young people dismiss the Army as a career.

            Those surveys were conducted over four months last spring and summer. They involved about 600 respondents, ages 16 to 28, per month. The Army discussed the general findings with The Associated Press but declined to provide detailed methodology, saying the surveys were done by a private research contractor and that licensing agreements limited the public release of some data collection details.

            Officials said that based on the surveys, young people simply do not see the Army as a safe place or good career path, and believe they would have to put their lives and careers on hold if they enlisted. 

            Army leaders said very few say they are deterred from enlisting due to “wokeness.” In fact, concerns about discrimination against women and minorities is seen as a bigger issue, along with a more general distrust of the military.

            “Wokeness” is a slang term that originally described attentiveness to issues of racial and social justice. Some people and groups, especially conservatives, now use it in a derogatory sense implying what they see as overreactions. 

            Republicans in Congress, including Rep. Jim Banks, chairman of the House Armed Services subcommittee on military personnel, have pledged to target “wokeness” this year. Banks, R-Ind., has said “exposing and dismantling the Biden administration’s woke agenda that is driving down military recruitment and retention” will be a top priority for him this year. His spokesman, Buckley Carlson, said combating “wokeness” at the Defense Department will be a key issue for the congressman.

            Banks and others have complained about the Pentagon’s efforts to target extremism in the military, provide courses in critical race theory and other efforts to expand diversity. They say focusing on partisan issues pushed by the left takes away from the Pentagon’s core missions, weakens the military and turns off recruits. 

            But the Army says that on average, only 5% of the respondents in the surveys listed “wokeness” as an issue, compared with 13% who say they believe that women and minorities will face discrimination and not get the same opportunities.

            Wormuth said the survey data is a tool to “assuage the concerns that some may have, whether influencers or members of Congress, about wokeness or the vaccine mandate — which is now rescinded — and show they are not, by any means, primary drivers of the recruiting challenges we’re experiencing.”

            She said the information from the surveys also provides insight on how the Army needs to better explain its benefits.

            Fink, the Army's marketing head, said the top three reasons young people cite for rejecting military enlistment are the same across all the services: fear of death, worries about post-traumatic stress disorder and leaving friends and family — in that order. He said the Army wanted a better understanding of any additional barriers to service, beyond those top three.

            By a “significant margin,” he said, the most common response beyond Nos. 1-3 was, “I will be putting my life on hold.” That was cited by more than 1 in 5 people surveyed.

            Many young people do not know anyone in the Army and are unfamiliar with the jobs or benefits it offers. Fink said trust in government institutions, including the military, has declined, particularly among this group.

            “They just don’t perceive the Army as being in touch with the modern, everyday culture that they’re used to,” he said.

            Fink said about 10% in the surveys say they do not trust military leadership, based on the way recent events or missions have been handled. That could include the Afghanistan withdrawal or use of the military during racial unrest and protests in the United States.

            Other reasons get much smaller mentions. They include concerns about living conditions on military bases, getting assigned to unwanted jobs, the coronavirus vaccine and the “wokeness” issue. 

            In some cases, those reasons vary by region. But Fink said the “wokeness” issue was pretty consistent — between 4% and 5% across the nation, without much variance by gender or ethnicity.WASHINGTON (AP) — While some Republicans blame the COVID-19 vaccine or “wokeness” for the Army's recruiting woes, the military service says the bigger hurdles are more traditional ones: Young people don’t want to die or get injured, deal with the stress of Army life and put their lives on hold.They “just don’t see the Army as something that’s relevant,” said Maj. Gen. Alex Fink, head of Army marketing. “They see us as revered, but not relevant, in their lives.”Addressing those longtime issues has taken on greater urgency as the Army tries to recover from its worst recruiting year in decades, a situation aggravated by the tight jobs market. The Army is offering new programs, advertising and enticements in an effort to change perceptions and reverse the decline.One incentive gives recruiters bonuses of up to $4,500 per quarter if they exceed their baseline enlistment requirement. A pilot program allows young enlisted soldiers — those in the three lower ranks — to get a promotion if they refer someone who enlists and goes to basic training. Only one promotion per soldier is allowed.The Army fell about 15,000 soldiers, or 25%, short of its 60,000 recruitment goal last year, when all the branches struggled to meet recruiting goals.Army Secretary Christine Wormuth said the Army has set a difficult goal for this year: aiming to bring in 65,000 recruits, which would be 20,000 more than in 2022. It’s difficult to predict how it will go, she said, adding that recruiters need to do all they can to surpass last year’s numbers.“I would say it is a stretch goal,” she said.Wormuth said she and Gen. James McConville, the Army's chief of staff, believed they needed to set a big goal.“I think we are seeing some forward momentum. But it is still too early to tell where we will likely land at the end of this fiscal year. I know we will do better than we did last year,” she said.Guiding the Army's efforts are surveys intended to help pinpoint why young people dismiss the Army as a career.Those surveys were conducted over four months last spring and summer. They involved about 600 respondents, ages 16 to 28, per month. The Army discussed the general findings with The Associated Press but declined to provide detailed methodology, saying the surveys were done by a private research contractor and that licensing agreements limited the public release of some data collection details.Officials said that based on the surveys, young people simply do not see the Army as a safe place or good career path, and believe they would have to put their lives and careers on hold if they enlisted.Army leaders said very few say they are deterred from enlisting due to “wokeness.” In fact, concerns about discrimination against women and minorities is seen as a bigger issue, along with a more general distrust of the military.“Wokeness” is a slang term that originally described attentiveness to issues of racial and social justice. Some people and groups, especially conservatives, now use it in a derogatory sense implying what they see as overreactions.Republicans in Congress, including Rep. Jim Banks, chairman of the House Armed Services subcommittee on military personnel, have pledged to target “wokeness” this year. Banks, R-Ind., has said “exposing and dismantling the Biden administration’s woke agenda that is driving down military recruitment and retention” will be a top priority for him this year. His spokesman, Buckley Carlson, said combating “wokeness” at the Defense Department will be a key issue for the congressman.Banks and others have complained about the Pentagon’s efforts to target extremism in the military, provide courses in critical race theory and other efforts to expand diversity. They say focusing on partisan issues pushed by the left takes away from the Pentagon’s core missions, weakens the military and turns off recruits.But the Army says that on average, only 5% of the respondents in the surveys listed “wokeness” as an issue, compared with 13% who say they believe that women and minorities will face discrimination and not get the same opportunities.Wormuth said the survey data is a tool to “assuage the concerns that some may have, whether influencers or members of Congress, about wokeness or the vaccine mandate — which is now rescinded — and show they are not, by any means, primary drivers of the recruiting challenges we’re experiencing.”She said the information from the surveys also provides insight on how the Army needs to better explain its benefits.Fink, the Army's marketing head, said the top three reasons young people cite for rejecting military enlistment are the same across all the services: fear of death, worries about post-traumatic stress disorder and leaving friends and family — in that order.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808158,GOP election tactics no surprise to Wisconsin's Black voters,"MILWAUKEE (AP) — Recent revelations about Republican election strategies targeting minority communities in Wisconsin's biggest city came as no surprise to many Black voters.

            A Wisconsin election commissioner bragged about low turnout in predominantly Black and Latino neighborhoods during last year’s elections. Weeks later, an audio recording surfaced that showed then-President Donald Trump’s Wisconsin campaign team laughing behind closed doors about efforts to reach Black voters in 2020.

            Many people who voted this past week in the state's primary election said they had long felt targeted by Republicans. The difference now is the public display of strategies that at best ignore the priorities of Black voters and at worst actively look to keep them from voting.











            “It’s a plan that they devised and carried out with quite a lot of precision,” said lifelong Milwaukee resident Dewayne Walls, 63. “It’s a repeatable pattern that’s going to continue to happen over and over as long as they have that plausible deniability and as long as they have the power in Madison” — the state capital.

            Walls and other Black voters said they are tired of the countless hurdles that disproportionately try to keep them from being heard at the ballot box. Voters said their experiences with the GOP have been as voices to silence, not to win over.

            “The Republican Party needs a lot of work. All of them need to actually step into our shoes, go in our neighborhoods, work our jobs, do the things that we’re doing on a daily basis and see how they feel about what’s going on once they experience it,” said Valeria Gray, 59.

            She described the relationship between Milwaukee and much of the rest of the state as one divided by race.

            ""It doesn’t look like it’s gonna ever go anywhere,” she said.

            Voting rights advocates for years have accused Wisconsin Republicans of pushing policies to suppress voters of color and lower-income voters. Many such policies centered on the Democratic stronghold of Milwaukee, home to nearly 70% of Wisconsin’s Black population.

            Those claims were reinforced by an email sent to about 1,700 people in December from Bob Spindell, a Republican member of the Wisconsin Election Commission. He said Republicans “can be especially proud” of depressed midterm voter turnout in predominantly Black and Latino neighborhoods in Milwaukee, a heavily Democratic city.

            Spindell later said his email was meant to convey the steps Republicans took to counter Democratic messaging in the city.

            The Associated Press then obtained an audio recording of a meeting in which the head of Trump’s 2020 Wisconsin campaign team talked with staff about their efforts to reach Black voters: ""We ever talk to Black people before? I don’t think so,” the campaign official said to laughter.

            Dwayne Morgan, 59, called it “the same old, same old” for the GOP in Milwaukee. “They’re trying to get us not to vote. They’re trying to wipe away the history,” he said.

            Republican-drawn legislative maps adopted last year dilute Milwaukee’s influence and nearly guarantee a Republican majority in the Legislature. That's despite statewide races routinely being decided by narrow margins and Democrats winning the major statewide offices, including for governor, attorney general and secretary of state.

            The Republican-controlled Legislature enacted strict voter ID laws in 2011 under then-Republican Gov. Scott Walker. Since his first term began in 2019, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers has vetoed more than a dozen GOP-backed bills that would make it harder to vote. Those include ID requirements for older and disabled voters who are indefinitely confined, limits on when and where absentee ballots could be collected, and prohibiting election officials from filling out missing voter information.

            Nonetheless, Republicans have prevailed in the courts, using lawsuits to outlaw ballot drop boxes and deny election clerks the ability to fill in missing information on the envelopes containing mail ballots. The Wisconsin Supreme Court’s conservative majority, which is at stake in this year's election, has routinely ruled in favor of Republicans on consequential voting decisions.

            That adds to a host of reasons Black voters in Milwaukee have increasingly felt as if their votes don’t matter. The city has some of the worst racial disparities nationwide in health care, education, wealth and incarceration.

            Low-income residents, who are disproportionately Black, already struggle to meet basic needs. Confusion over new election rules or limited options for when and where they can vote further discourage voting, said the Rev. Greg Lewis, founder of Souls to the Polls Milwaukee.

            “Suppression is not just a few things,” he said. “It’s not just, not being able to vote without IDs. It’s not just, not being able to take your ballots to the drop box. It’s not just language barriers. It’s all those things together.”

            For Barbara Bryant, 76, “all the extra steps” were the biggest barrier to voting. But she wasn’t going to be deterred from participating in this month's primary. This past week, amid a snowstorm, a poll worker helped her from her car and into an early voting location.

            Bryant said she has preferred voting early in recent years so poll workers have time to explain any new rules, but she has seen inaccessible voting sites and the removal of drop boxes discourage other older adults from voting.

            Wisconsin Republicans told the AP they have been trying for a decade to make inroads with Black and Latino voters in Milwaukee.

            The state party opened its first office in downtown Milwaukee in 2019, specifically with the goal of reaching out to Black voters. The focus is on engaging them in conversation, rather than meeting typical campaign metrics such as knocking on a certain number of doors, said Mark Jefferson, the state GOP executive director.

            He said the party is not trying to suppress votes, but to chip away at the support for Democrats in those communities.

            “People are listening when they haven’t before,” Jefferson said. “I think we’ve learned a lot. I think we are cutting into Democrats’ margins, albeit faster currently in the Latino community and the Hispanic communities. But we’re also cutting into margins on the north side of Milwaukee, as well. And that’s because we are more in touch than we were.”

            Angela Lang, executive director of Milwaukee-based Black Leaders Organizing Communities, wasn’t worried about Republicans gaining a foothold with Black voters. She said the GOP’s priorities are fundamentally at odds with what most Black voters in Milwaukee want.

            But Lang said she was concerned about the precedent that could be set by Republicans so openly talking about strategies to lower turnout.

            “It’s incredibly dangerous, because when one starts, then people just feel more emboldened,” she said.

            Several Black votes interviewed at the polls said they had seen little activity from Republicans in the city and described the GOP outreach center as more of a showpiece for the party.

            “I don’t think they ever come down here to try to reach us at all,"" said voter Damario Wright, 36. “I mean, you barely see a Republican in Milwaukee — come on, now.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808174,"Champions League back with Messi, Mbappé doubt, legal drama","The Champions League returns on Tuesday to a very different European soccer scene than it was before a three-month midseason break.

            In the interim, Lionel Messi won his first World Cup title. Kylian Mbappé almost won his second, then got injured. Early-season favorites for the European title fell into slumps at home.

            Meanwhile, one standout team before the World Cup, Napoli, has marched on and aims for its first quarterfinal place in the competition’s 68-year history.











            Off the field, the Super League project that tried to effectively kill the Champions League met a serious legal setback, and English title holder Manchester City faces Premier League charges of financial wrongdoing that could one day stop the club entering future Champions Leagues.

            It adds up to plenty of drama even before soccer’s most prized club competition resumes with a stellar game between Paris Saint-Germain and Bayern Munich.

            A rematch of the 2020 final won by Bayern pairs two powers that helped stop the Super League in 2021 by refusing to join it. What it was not expected to have at Parc des Princes were the goalscorer and goalkeeper with the best records from the group stage.

            Mbappé, who scored seven goals across five different Champions League games in the fall, was set to miss most of February with a thigh injury. He made a surprise return to training on Sunday.

            Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer’s season is over because he broke a leg skiing on a vacation taken after Germany’s quick exit from the World Cup.

            The other game Tuesday pairs AC Milan and Tottenham, two of the seven round-of-16 teams that are currently outside the Champions League qualifying places in their domestic leagues. Chelsea is another and visits Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday, when Club Brugge hosts Benfica.

            Four more first-leg games are scheduled Feb. 21-22.

            MESSI QUEST

            At age 35, Messi finally has a World Cup title for Argentina. Now back to the business of winning a fifth Champions League.

            When Messi won his fourth title with Barcelona in 2015 Barack Obama was president, Britain was in the European Union and Jose Mourinho won a league title, at Chelsea. 

            Messi has not been to the final since and his first try with PSG ended in the round of 16 against Madrid. When he last faced Bayern it was an 8-2 rout over Barcelona in the single-leg quarterfinals of the pandemic-hit 2020 edition.

            Both PSG and Bayern have misfired since the World Cup. PSG was unbeaten entering 2023 then lost three in the league and is out of the French Cup. Bayern still leads the Bundesliga after restarting with three straight draws.

            TEAMS IN SLUMPS

            A Champions League adage is the team you draw after the group stage is not always the one you meet in February.

            When the last-16 draw was made on Nov. 7, Real Madrid was the unbeaten Spanish league leader paired with an already inconsistent Liverpool. Madrid has now lost three of eight and let Barcelona take a dominating lead.

            At least second-place Madrid is so far clear of fifth in La Liga to be almost sure of qualifying for next season's Champions League.

            Not so, Chelsea, Tottenham and Liverpool. Nor AC Milan, Leipzig, Eintracht Frankfurt and Club Brugge. None is currently on track to qualify for next season's competition.

            For Liverpool and Chelsea, European champions in 2019 and 2021, actually winning another final on June 10 in Istanbul might be their best chance of being in the group-stage draw in August. That should be worth about 100 million euros ($107 million) in UEFA prize money.

            That cash now looks almost essential to Chelsea after a season of lavish transfer spending signed off by American owner Todd Boehly. 

            Chelsea plays a Dortmund team third in the Bundesliga, just three points behind Bayern, without yet seeming a convincing title challenger.

            HALLER’S RETURN

            Dortmund already has a great comeback story: Sébastien Haller’s return from a cancer diagnosis and chemotherapy treatment.

            Haller should make his European debut for Dortmund eight months since he was the club's marquee summer signing to replace Erling Haaland.

            Haaland had five goals for Manchester City in the group, including in a 2-1 home win over Dortmund. He must wait another week to travel back to Germany for the first leg against Leipzig.

            DARK HORSES

            Napoli and Benfica topped their groups in November — ahead of Liverpool and PSG, respectively — to be seeded in the draw and avoid teams like Madrid, Bayern and Man City. Napoli travels to Eintracht Frankfurt on Feb. 21, and Benfica plays Wednesday at Brugge.

            Both are set up for domestic titles after strong returns from the World Cup break. Could an elusive Champions League title follow? Benfica has not been European champion since 1962, Napoli never got close.

            However, Napoli mostly stayed out of January trading while Benfica sold Argentina midfielder Enzo Fernandez to Chelsea for a British record fee of about 120 million euros ($128 million).

            Benfica should have enough to eliminate Brugge, which fired coach Carl Hoefkens in December after poor domestic results despite overachieving in the Champions League. Brugge hired Scott Parker, whose previous game had been a 9-0 loss at Liverpool in August with Bournemouth.

            SUPER LEAGUE?

            Back in November, Barcelona and Juventus failed to advance out of the Champions League groups as they and fellow Super League rebel Madrid awaited news of their legal challenge to UEFA at the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg.

            The court’s initial non-binding opinion in December was to disagree with the clubs’ claim that UEFA has monopoly control of European competitions. The final ruling of 15 judges is expected in weeks. 

            Barcelona now leads La Liga and has a stellar game this week with Manchester United in the Europa League knockout playoffs.

            Juventus, which hosts Nantes in the Europa League on Thursday, has other issues — a 15-point deduction in Serie A during a criminal investigation of alleged false accounting that led to the board of directors resigning.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808175,US holds drills in South China Sea amid tensions with China,"BEIJING (AP) — The United States Navy and Marine Corps are holding joint exercises in the South China Sea at a time of heightened tensions with Beijing over the shooting down of a suspected Chinese spy balloon. 

            The 7th Fleet based in Japan said Sunday that the USS Nimitz aircraft carrier strike group and the 13th Marine Expeditionary Unit have been conducting “integrated expeditionary strike force operations” in the South China Sea. 

            It said exercises involving ships, ground forces and aircraft took place Saturday but gave no details on when the began or whether they had ended. 











            China claims virtually the entire South China Sea and strongly objects to military activity by other nations in the contested waterway through which $5 trillion in goods are shipped every year.

            The U.S. takes no official position on sovereignty in the South China Sea, but maintains that freedom of navigation and overflight must be preserved. Several times a year, it sends ships sailing past fortified Chinese outposts in the Spratly Islands, prompting protests from Beijing. 

            The U.S. has also been strengthening its defense alliance with the Philippines, which has faced encroachment on islands and fisheries by the Chinese coast guard and nominally civilian but government-backed fleets. 

            The U.S. military exercises were planned in advance. They come as already tense relations between Washington and Beijing have been exacerbated by a diplomatic row sparked by the balloon, which was shot down last weekend in U.S. airspace off the coast of South Carolina. 

            The U.S. said the unmanned balloon was equipped to detect and collect intelligence signals, but Beijing insists it was a weather research airship that had accidently blown off course.

            The balloon prompted Secretary of State Antony Blinken to abruptly cancel a high-stakes trip to Beijing aimed at easing tensions. 

            After first issuing a highly rare expression of regret over the balloon, China has toughened its rhetoric, calling the U.S. shootdown an overreaction and a violation of international norms. China's defense minister refused to take a phone call from U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to discuss the matter.

            The United States has since blacklisted six Chinese entities it said were linked to Beijing’s aerospace programs as part of its response to the incident. The House of Representatives also voted unanimously to condemn China for a “brazen violation” of U.S. sovereignty and efforts to “deceive the international community through false claims about its intelligence collection campaigns.”

            The balloon was part of a large surveillance program that China has been conducting for several years, the Pentagon said. The U.S. says Chinese balloons have flown over dozens of countries across five continents in recent years, and it learned more about the balloon program after closely monitoring the one shot down near South Carolina.

            In its news release, the 7th Fleet said the joint operation had “established a powerful presence in the region, which supports peace and stability.""

            “As a ready response force, we underpin a broad spectrum of missions including landing Marines ashore, humanitarian disaster relief, and deterring potential adversaries through visible and present combat power,"" the release said.BEIJING (AP) — The United States Navy and Marine Corps are holding joint exercises in the South China Sea at a time of heightened tensions with Beijing over the shooting down of a suspected Chinese spy balloon.The 7th Fleet based in Japan said Sunday that the USS Nimitz aircraft carrier strike group and the 13th Marine Expeditionary Unit have been conducting “integrated expeditionary strike force operations” in the South China Sea.It said exercises involving ships, ground forces and aircraft took place Saturday but gave no details on when the began or whether they had ended.China claims virtually the entire South China Sea and strongly objects to military activity by other nations in the contested waterway through which $5 trillion in goods are shipped every year.The U.S. takes no official position on sovereignty in the South China Sea, but maintains that freedom of navigation and overflight must be preserved.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808188,"Cyprus: Christodoulides, Mavroyiannis face off for top job","People in Cyprus voted on Sunday in a tightly contested presidential runoff, with former Foreign Minister Nikos Christodoulides facing off against seasoned diplomat Andreas Mavroyiannis.Polling stations close at 6:00 p. m. local time (1600 GMT).Mavroyiannis is backed by the communist AKEL party, while Christodoulides split away from the ruling conservative Democratic Rally (DISY) and has received support from a number of smaller centrist and right-wing parties. DISY candidate Averof Neofytou came third in the first round of voting last week, causing the party to be left out of the final stage of the presidential race for the first time in its history.Cyprus's ruling party has not thrown its support behind either candidate in the runoff.Major issues of concern for voters have been the cost of living crisis, irregular immigration and the Cyprus dispute involving the Turkish-occupied north of the island.Andreas Theophanous of the Cyprus Center for European and International Affairs think tank said that many voters are likely to opt for ""the least worse candidate — a characteristic in most elections, but more so in this one.""Electoral officials said that turnout had increased slightly compared to the first round, with 35.4% of registered voters having gone to the polls by noon.Outgoing President Nicos Anastasiades urged Cypriots to come out ""en masse to participate in this electoral process.""""This is our duty. The people decide, the majority decides and the minority respects,"" he said.Christodoulides was expelled from the ruling DISY party after announcing his candidacy and ran as an independent. In the first round of voting last week, he was in the lead with 32.04% of the vote.Christodoulides was appointed government spokesman in 2014 and foreign minister in 2018. He has the support of the Democratic Party, the Movement for Social Democracy and the Democratic Alignment.Opponents have accused Christodoulides of contributing to deadlock over resolving the status of the breakaway Turkish Cypriot north during his term as foreign minister.""The Cypriot people know and understand what is at stake... I have complete confidence in their judgement,"" Christodoulides told reporters.""What is important is unity,"" Christodoulides said after casting his vote.Andreas Mavroyiannis, who is backed by the communist AKEL party, received 29.59% in the first round last Sunday.Movrayiannis is also seasoned diplomat, having served as the negotiator for the Greek Cypriot side in the Cyprus talks under Anastasiades and was Cyprus's permanent representative at the UN.""I think we're doing very well, all the indications are that we'll be the winners and so will Cyprus,"" Mavroyiannis said.sdi/dj (AFP, AP, Reuters)",2023/02/12,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808189,NATO chief Stoltenberg has 'no intention' of extending tenure,"NATO chief, Jens Stoltenberg, has no plans to extend his mandate for a fourth time, the military alliance said Sunday.""The mandate of Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has been extended three times, and he has served for a total of almost nine years,"" spokeswoman Oana Lungescu said.""The Secretary-General's term comes to an end in October of this year, and he has no intention to seek another extension of his mandate.""It follows a report by the German newspaper, Welt am Sonntag, that reported member states wanted him to stay on while Russia wages war in Ukraine.The former Norwegian prime minister took office at NATO's Brussels headquarters in October 2014.Diplomats from several NATO allies had also speculated that Stoltenberg's mandate could be extended again until a summit next year to mark 75 years of the alliance.Stoltenberg is currently NATO's second-longest serving secretary-general, eclipsed only by Joseph Luns of the Netherlands who held the post from 1971 to 1984.He is particularly credited with moderating in a dispute between former US President Donald Trump and European allies over defense spending.The last NATO personnel and US forces left Afghanistan in August 2021, and Stoltenberg has also overseen NATO's response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the ongoing war.NATO leaders are expected to name a new secretary-general by July when they gather for a summit in Vilnius.lo/kb (AFP, dpa, Reuters)",2023/02/12,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808190,Sweeney gets 5th World Cup medal of season for USA Luge,"WINTERBERG, Germany (AP) — USA Luge’s Emily Sweeney picked up her team-best fifth medal of the World Cup season on Sunday, a bronze in a women’s singles race.

            Julia Taubitz of Germany won the race in 1 minute, 51.683 seconds. Anna Berreiter of Germany was second in 1:51.891 and Sweeney was third in 1:52.038.

            It was Sweeney's fourth singles medal of the season, the first three of them being silvers and one of them coming in a sprint race. She also was part of a team relay bronze-medal run earlier this season for the Americans.











            “It’s nice to be back on the podium,” said Sweeney, who has dealt with recurring neck issues this season. “That makes me very happy.”

            It was Taubitz’s 20th career World Cup win.

            Germany again was the dominant team on the weekend, with Max Langenhan winning in men’s singles, Tobias Wendl and Tobias Arlt winning in men’s doubles and Jessica Degenhardt and Cheyenne Rosenthal prevailing in women’s doubles.

            Langenhan, Taubitz, the Wendl-Arlt sled and the Latvian women’s doubles team of Anda Upite and Sanija Ozolina also won World Cup sprint race golds on Sunday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808199,Cambodian leader shuts down independent media outlet,"PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) — Cambodia’s Prime Minister Hun Sen on Sunday ordered one of the handful of independent media broadcasters to shut down for publishing an article he said intentionally slandered his son in connection with the country's relief assistance to earthquake victims in Turkey. 

            The article published by VOD, which also owns a radio station, centered around the signing of a government decision to donate $100,000 to Turkey. It alleged that Lt. Gen. Hun Manet, an elder son of Hun Sen who is also the commander of the army and has been nominated by the ruling party to succeed his father in future elections, had signed the document on Hun Sen's behalf. 

            Hun Sen had earlier given VOD 72 hours to verify the facts with the Information Ministry and to apologize to Hun Manet and the government. On Sunday evening, Hun Sen nevertheless ordered the ministry to revoke VOD's license and said he cannot accept a letter of apology offered by the media organization. 











            Hun Sen said the article misinterpreted the facts and that only the prime minister has the authority to make decisions on foreign aid. 

            VOD said it was an unintentional mistake. 

            Hun Sen said VOD had until 10 a.m. Monday to cease broadcasting, and foreign countries who fund the organization should get their money back.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808210,"US jets down 4 objects in 8 days, unprecedented in peacetime","WASHINGTON (AP) — A U.S. fighter jet shot down an “unidentified object” over Lake Huron on Sunday on orders from President Joe Biden. It was the fourth such downing in eight days and the latest military strike in an extraordinary chain of events over U.S. airspace that Pentagon officials believe has no peacetime precedent.

            Part of the reason for the repeated shootdowns is a “heightened alert” following a spy balloon from China that emerged over U.S. airspace in late January, Gen. Glen VanHerck, head of NORAD and U.S. Northern Command, said in a briefing with reporters.

            Since then, fighter jets last week also shot down objects over Canada and Alaska. Pentagon officials said they posed no security threats, but so little was known about them that Pentagon officials were ruling nothing out — not even UFOs. 











            “We have been more closely scrutinizing our airspace at these altitudes, including enhancing our radar, which may at least partly explain the increase,” said Melissa Dalton, assistant defense secretary for homeland defense.

            U.S. authorities have made clear that they constantly monitor for unknown radar blips, and it is not unusual to shut down airspace as a precaution to evaluate them. But the unusually assertive response was raising questions about whether such use of force was warranted, particularly as administration officials said the objects were not of great national security concern and the downings were just out of caution. 

            VanHerck said the U.S. adjusted its radar so it could track slower objects. “With some adjustments, we’ve been able to get a better categorization of radar tracks now,"" he said, ""and that’s why I think you’re seeing these, plus there’s a heightened alert to look for this information.""

            He added: “I believe this is the first time within United States or American airspace that NORAD or United States Northern Command has taken kinetic action against an airborne object.""

            Asked if officials have ruled out extraterrestrials, VanHerck said, “I haven’t ruled out anything at this point.”

            The Pentagon officials said they were still trying to determine what exactly the objects were and said they had considered using the jets' guns instead of missiles, but it proved to be too difficult. They drew a strong distinction between the three shot down over this weekend and the balloon from China.

            Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz tweeted that airmen in the 148th Fighter Wing, an Air National Guard fighter unit in Duluth, shot down the object over Lake Huron.

            The extraordinary air defense activity began in late January, when a white orb the officials said was from China appeared over the U.S. and hovered above the nation for days before fighter jets downed it off the coast of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. That event played out over livestream. Many Americans have been captivated by the drama playing out in the skies as fighter jets scramble to shoot down objects. 

            The latest brought down was first detected on Saturday evening over Montana, but it was initially thought to be an anomaly. Radar picked it up again Sunday hovering over the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and it was going over Lake Huron, Pentagon officials said Sunday.

            U.S. and Canadian authorities had restricted some airspace over the lake earlier Sunday as planes were scrambled to intercept and try to identify the object. According to a senior administration official, the object was octagonal, with strings hanging off, but had no discernable payload. It was flying low at about 20,000 feet, said the official who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. 

            Meanwhile, U.S. officials were still trying to precisely identify two other objects shot down by F-22 fighter jets, and were working to determine whether China was responsible as concerns escalated about what Washington said was Beijing's large-scale aerial surveillance program.

            An object shot down Saturday over Canada's Yukon was described by U.S. officials as a balloon significantly smaller than the balloon — the size of three school buses — hit by a missile Feb. 4. A flying object brought down over the remote northern coast of Alaska on Friday was more cylindrical and described as a type of airship. 

            Both were believed to have a payload, either attached or suspended from them, according to the officials who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing investigation. Officials were not able to say who launched the objects and were seeking to figure out their origin.

            The three objects were much smaller in size, different in appearance and flew at lower altitudes than the suspected spy balloon that fell into the Atlantic Ocean after the U.S. missile strike. 

            The officials said the other three objects were not consistent with the fleet of Chinese aerial surveillance balloons that targeted more than 40 countries, stretching back at least into the Trump administration. 

            Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told ABC’s “This Week” that U.S. officials were working quickly to recover debris. Using shorthand to describe the objects as balloons, he said U.S military and intelligence officials were “focused like a laser” on gathering and accumulating the information, then compiling a comprehensive analysis.

            “The bottom line is until a few months ago we didn’t know about these balloons,” Schumer, D-N.Y., said of the spy program that the administration has linked to the People’s Liberation Army, China’s military. “It is wild that we didn’t know.”

            Eight days ago, F-22 jets downed the large white balloon that had wafted over the U.S. for days at an altitude of about 60,000 feet. U.S. officials immediately blamed China, saying the balloon was equipped to detect and collect intelligence signals and could maneuver itself. White House officials said improved surveillance capabilities helped detect it.

            China's Foreign Ministry said the unmanned balloon was a civilian meteorological airship that had blown off course. Beijing said the U.S. had “overreacted” by shooting it down. 

            Then, on Friday, North American Aerospace Defense Command, the combined U.S.-Canada organization that provides shared defense of airspace over the two nations, detected and shot down an object near sparsely populated Deadhorse, Alaska.

            Later that evening, NORAD detected a second object, flying at a high altitude over Alaska, U.S. officials said. It crossed into Canadian airspace on Saturday and was over the Yukon, a remote territory, when it was ordered shot down by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

            In both of those incidents, the objects were flying at roughly 40,000 feet. The object on Sunday was flying at 20,000 feet. 

            The cases have increased diplomatic tensions between the United States and China, raised questions about the extent of Beijing’s American surveillance, and prompted days of criticism from Republican lawmakers about the administration’s response.

But the unusually assertive response was raising questions about whether such use of force was warranted, particularly as administration officials said the objects were not of great national security concern and the downings were just out of caution.VanHerck said the U.S. adjusted its radar so it could track slower objects. “With some adjustments, we’ve been able to get a better categorization of radar tracks now,"" he said, ""and that’s why I think you’re seeing these, plus there’s a heightened alert to look for this information.""He added: “I believe this is the first time within United States or American airspace that NORAD or United States Northern Command has taken kinetic action against an airborne object.""Asked if officials have ruled out extraterrestrials, VanHerck said, “I haven’t ruled out anything at this point.”The Pentagon officials said they were still trying to determine what exactly the objects were and said they had considered using the jets' guns instead of missiles, but it proved to be too difficult. They drew a strong distinction between the three shot down over this weekend and the balloon from China.Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz tweeted that airmen in the 148th Fighter Wing, an Air National Guard fighter unit in Duluth, shot down the object over Lake Huron.The extraordinary air defense activity began in late January, when a white orb the officials said was from China appeared over the U.S. and hovered above the nation for days before fighter jets downed it off the coast of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. That event played out over livestream. Many Americans have been captivated by the drama playing out in the skies as fighter jets scramble to shoot down objects.The latest brought down was first detected on Saturday evening over Montana, but it was initially thought to be an anomaly. Radar picked it up again Sunday hovering over the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and it was going over Lake Huron, Pentagon officials said Sunday.U.S. and Canadian authorities had restricted some airspace over the lake earlier Sunday as planes were scrambled to intercept and try to identify the object. According to a senior administration official, the object was octagonal, with strings hanging off, but had no discernable payload. It was flying low at about 20,000 feet, said the official who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.Meanwhile, U.S. officials were still trying to precisely identify two other objects shot down by F-22 fighter jets, and were working to determine whether China was responsible as concerns escalated about what Washington said was Beijing's large-scale aerial surveillance program.An object shot down Saturday over Canada's Yukon was described by U.S. officials as a balloon significantly smaller than the balloon — the size of three school buses — hit by a missile Feb. 4. A flying object brought down over the remote northern coast of Alaska on Friday was more cylindrical and described as a type of airship.Both were believed to have a payload, either attached or suspended from them, according to the officials who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing investigation. Officials were not able to say who launched the objects and were seeking to figure out their origin.The three objects were much smaller in size, different in appearance and flew at lower altitudes than the suspected spy balloon that fell into the Atlantic Ocean after the U.S. missile strike.The officials said the other three objects were not consistent with the fleet of Chinese aerial surveillance balloons that targeted more than 40 countries, stretching back at least into the Trump administration.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told ABC’s “This Week” that U.S. officials were working quickly to recover debris. Using shorthand to describe the objects as balloons, he said U.S military and intelligence officials were “focused like a laser” on gathering and accumulating the information, then compiling a comprehensive analysis.“The bottom line is until a few months ago we didn’t know about these balloons,” Schumer, D-N.Y., said of the spy program that the administration has linked to the People’s Liberation Army, China’s military. “It is wild that we didn’t know.”Eight days ago, F-22 jets downed the large white balloon that had wafted over the U.S. for days at an altitude of about 60,000 feet. U.S. officials immediately blamed China, saying the balloon was equipped to detect and collect intelligence signals and could maneuver itself. White House officials said improved surveillance capabilities helped detect it.China's Foreign Ministry said the unmanned balloon was a civilian meteorological airship that had blown off course. Beijing said the U.S. had “overreacted” by shooting it down.Then, on Friday, North American Aerospace Defense Command, the combined U.S.-Canada organization that provides shared defense of airspace over the two nations, detected and shot down an object near sparsely populated Deadhorse, Alaska.Later that evening, NORAD detected a second object, flying at a high altitude over Alaska, U.S. officials said. It crossed into Canadian airspace on Saturday and was over the Yukon, a remote territory, when it was ordered shot down by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.In both of those incidents, the objects were flying at roughly 40,000 feet. The object on Sunday was flying at 20,000 feet.The cases have increased diplomatic tensions between the United States and China, raised questions about the extent of Beijing’s American surveillance, and prompted days of criticism from Republican lawmakers about the administration’s response.___Associated Press writers Aamer Madhani, Michael Balsamo, Ellen Knickmeyer and Tara Copp contributed to this report.",2023/02/13,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808224,"Jonathan David scores twice, Lille climbs to 5th","PARIS (AP) — Canada striker Jonathan David scored twice to move Lille up to fifth place in the French league with a 2-0 win over struggling Strasbourg on Sunday.

            David converted a penalty in the 23rd minute before flicking home a rebound in the 28th to raise his tally to 14 league goals this season. 

            “Jonathan is a very smart player. I think he’s very strong today when he runs into space,” Lille coach Paulo Fonseca said. “But I think that he can improve his game in the box. Make quick decisions, choose simple solutions.” 











            Lille won the league in 2021 but only finished 10th last season. 

            Teenager Rayan Cherki scored and had an assist in Lyon's 2-1 victory over Lens. 

            Lyon pulled within six points of the last European spot, and fourth-place Lens is winless in its last four league games. Cherki netted the winner from a tight angle in the 64th minute. He also fed Alexandre Lacazette, who fired into the far corner in the 23rd for his 14th league goal. 

            Lens wing back Deiver Machado had leveled with a powerful strike into the top corner in the 39th.

            Lacazette seemed to pull his hamstring on the stroke of halftime and had to be replaced with Amin Sarr. 

            Toulouse proved lethal in transition to stun Rennes 3-1. Rennes has now lost three of its last four league games to slip to sixth place while Toulouse moved into the middle of the table after 23 rounds. 

            Toulouse opened the scoring on a counterattack in the 27th when Rafael Ratao converted a rebound. A minute later, Morocco winger Zakaria Aboukhlal capitalized on a turnover by Arthur Theate to double the lead. Dutch striker Thijs Dallinga made it 3-0 with a first-time effort in the 37th to notch his eighth league goal. 

            Rennes scored a consolation goal in the 55th when Toulouse center back Anthony Rouault turned a cross from Jeremy Doku into his own net. 

            “I think we lacked focus, commitment and aggressiveness,” Rennes coach Bruno Genesio told the club’s website. “There’s certainly a mental aspect which is more difficult to explain.” 

            Reims thrashed Troyes 4-0 to stay 10th. Zimbabwe midfielder Marshall Munetsi put Reims ahead in the 10th before setting up Myziane Maolida in the 44th. Arsenal loanee Folarin Balogun made it 3-0 with a strike into the bottom corner in the 50th to consolidate his spot as the top scorer in the league by notching his 15th goal. Jens Cajuste sealed the win in the 82nd. 

            Montpellier benefited from the new manager bounce after appointing Michel der Zakarian as coach on Wednesday to move five points above the relegation zone. Der Zakarian led Montpellier to a 3-0 win over his former club Brest, which dismissed him last October. 

            Montpellier scored with an own-goal from Brest defender Christophe Herelle in the fourth minute, a penalty from Teji Savanier in the 17th and a half-volley from Elye Wahi in the 54th. 

            Nantes edged Lorient 1-0 with a curling shot from Ludovic Blas in the 66th. Struggling since the departure of Nigeria striker Terem Moffi and Burkina Faso winger Dango Ouattara during the January transfer window, Lorient has taken only one point from the last three games to drop to eighth place.

            The last two teams in the league, Auxerre and Angers, drew 1-1. Teenage striker Matthis Abline equalized for 19th-place Auxerre with a penalty in the 22nd but then hit the bar with another spot kick in the third minute of stoppage time. 

            Defending champion Paris Saint-Germain had its lead atop the standings cut to five points after losing 3-1 at Monaco on Saturday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808227,Super Bowl week was back to its normal wildness this year,"PHOENIX (AP) — From Super Bowl opening night to the night before the big game, the party was on all week long. 

            The frenzy was back in full force this year after COVID-19 restrictions limited the wild, zany atmosphere that surrounds the most-anticipated and most-hyped week on the sports calendar.

            More than 6,000 media members from 24 countries were accredited to provide coverage of the Kansas City Chiefs vs. the Philadelphia Eagles and related events onsite in Arizona, per the NFL. 











            Officials estimated 100,000 visitors were passing through the area surrounding the downtown convention center where the NFL set up its Super Bowl Experience, an interactive theme park.

            That doesn't count the hundreds of thousands of people who came out for the WM Phoenix Open in Scottsdale, 20 miles from downtown Phoenix. About 600,000 attended the tournament this week, including some 200,000 fans on Saturday with many wearing Chiefs and Eagles gear. It's expected to wrap up in time for people to watch or go to the big game.

            The Super Bowl media center was buzzing with a record 128 outlets filling radio row, which now includes podcasts and television networks.

            Restaurants were packed, parties were crowded, hotels were booked, traffic blocked streets and people were everywhere just as in the pre-pandemic days.

            Red-clad Chiefs fans flooded the streets, doing the Chiefs’ tomahawk chop chant. A sea of green-wearing Eagles fans screamed “Go Birds” and sang “Fly! Eagles! Fly!”

            “This community has opened their arms,” NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said. “This is a wonderful community. It’s a diverse community. The indigenous communities here, we’re so proud to partner with them also.”

            There was a strong sense of normalcy at last year’s Super Bowl in Los Angeles but the teams held opening night remotely and in-person availability with players and coaches was shortened to a couple of days because of COVID-19 restrictions.

            The league suspended protocols in March and had no issues throughout the season.

            The Chiefs and Eagles met the media on opening night and three more times through Thursday, a return of several opportunities to interview players and coaches.

            This is Kansas City’s third appearance in a Super Bowl in four years. Chiefs coach Andy Reid made sure to install the game plan last week while the team practiced at home.

            “You can take your time and make sure you’re nice and thorough — we didn’t rush into it,” he said. “Before you get down to Arizona, with the distractions and different events that go on, you’d like to at least have the base part (established). If you have to tweak here or there, you can do that.”

            Eagles coach Nick Sirianni treated his family time this week in Arizona like a normal week back in Philadelphia. 

            “I’ll see them Thursday and I'll do my very best to be a really good dad on Thursday, but on Tuesday and Wednesday, I’ll do what I normally do,” he said earlier in the week. “I’ll be in the office late, continuing to work through the plan, continuing to iron out the details of the plan.”

            Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, who won his second AP NFL Most Valuable Player award on Thursday night, told his teammates to keep their focus on the game and avoid the hoopla surrounding it.

            “The Super Bowl week is special. It’s a special week, but it’s not about being down there the week of the Super Bowl, it’s about winning the game,” Mahomes said. “I want guys to keep that at the front of mind. Enjoy it, enjoy the whole entire week, but make sure you’re prepared to go out there and play your best football as well.”

            More than 70,000 screaming fans will greet Mahomes, Jalen Hurts and the teams on Sunday. Even more fans will be around the stadium without tickets to soak in the fun.

            A tailgate hosted by Guy Fieri is free for 10,000 people who pre-registered for tickets. The tailgate starts at 11:30 a.m. and is a short walk from the stadium. It features more than 20 different restaurant pop-ups and interactive dining experiences for fans. Diplo will perform live as the musical entertainment.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808231,"Man, 19, charged in violent protest outside UK asylum hotel","LONDON (AP) — British police charged a 19-year-old man Sunday with violent disorder and assault in connection with a protest outside a hotel housing asylum-seekers in northwest England. 

            Police said an initially peaceful protest outside the Suites Hotel in Knowsley, near Liverpool, turned violent Friday when some demonstrators threw projectiles including lit fireworks at police and attacked a police van with hammers before setting it aflame. 

            Jarad Skeete, 19, was arrested alongside 14 others at the protest. Skeete, who was accused of violent disorder and assaulting an emergency services worker, was remanded in custody and due to appear in court Monday. 











            Police said the incident left an officer and two members of the public with slight injuries. 

            Lawmaker Lisa Nandy, from the opposition Labour Party, criticized the government for creating a “toxic” mix of anti-migrant rhetoric and poor accommodation provisions for asylum-seekers awaiting decisions on their applications. 

            “When you lay onto that a government that talks about things like an ‘invasion’ in relation to immigration, you have a perfect storm, a really toxic mix that is being created,"" Nandy told the BBC.

            Development minister Andrew Mitchell said Britain's Conservative government condemned the violence and was trying hard to “stop the excessive use of hotels” to house migrants.

            Britain takes in fewer asylum-seekers than some of its European neighbors, including France and Germany, but has seen a sharp increase in the number of people trying to reach the U.K. by crossing the English Channel in dinghies and other small boats. 

            More than 45,000 people reached Britain by that route in 2022. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has said stopping the small boat crossings is one of his top priorities. 

            Meanwhile, scores of migrants have had to wait for months or longer for a decision on their asylum claims, with many stuck in hotels or other unsuitable temporary accommodation. 

            It wasn't the first time a migrant center was targeted for violence. In October, an attacker firebombed a processing center for new arrivals in the Channel port of Dover. Police said the man was motivated by far-right ideology. He killed himself after the attack.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808233,Marcus Rashford scores again as Man United beats Leeds 2-0,"LEEDS, England (AP) — Marcus Rashford scored his 21st goal of the season in Manchester United's 2-0 win against Leeds in the Premier League on Sunday. 

            Substitute Alejandro Garnacho also struck as Erik ten Hag's team moved to within five points of leader Arsenal. 

            United had its title hopes hit by Leeds in a 2-2 draw at Old Trafford on Wednesday, but made up for that by picking up three points at Elland Road. 











            Arsenal's 1-1 draw with Brentford on Saturday meant United had the chance to cut the Londoners' lead and move into title contention. 

            Rashford has 13 goals in his last 15 games and is leading his team's charge toward the top of the table.

            He broke the deadlock after 80 minutes with a clinical header from 6 meters and Garnacho made certain of the win five minutes later.

            Wout Weghorst thought he had added a third, but that goal was ruled out for offside. 

            The win will feed the growing belief United can mount an unlikely title challenge in a bid to be crowned English champions for the first time since 2013.

            Toney, who is Black, was targeted on social media following his goal in the Premier League game at Etihad Stadium on Saturday. 

            “Immediately after Brentford’s game against Arsenal, Ivan Toney received a barrage of abusive, racist direct messages via his Instagram account,” Brentford said. “We are disgusted and saddened that Ivan has had to deal with this yet again.”











            Arsenal immediately offered its support to Toney and said it was working with Brentford to identify those involved.

            “At Arsenal we condemn all forms of discrimination and take a zero tolerance approach. We will apply the strongest possible action to anyone we can identify sending hateful messages.”

            Toney evened the score in the 74th minute after Leandro Trossard had struck in the 66th. 

            The result dented Arsenal's title bid, coming after the league leaders lost to Everton last week. 

            The Premier League said it “condemns all forms of discrimination.”

            “No one should have to face abuse of the kind received by Ivan Toney,” it said. “It has no place in football or society. We are supporting Ivan and the club with investigations.”

            Toney was targeted after a game against Brighton in October and shared screenshots of an Instagram direct message containing racist language.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808236,BBC head under pressure over loan to ex-PM Boris Johnson,"The chairman of the BBC, Britain's main public broadcaster, faced pressure to resign on Sunday after he was found to have breached ethical standards over the Boris Johnson loan scandal.A committee of UK lawmakers found that Richard Sharp had made ""significant errors of judgment"" by not revealing that he had acted as a go-between to help the former UK prime minister secure an 800,000 pound ($964,640, €902,000) loan.Sharp was appointed to lead the BBC shortly after the loan was arranged.The cross-party Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee said Sharp's actions ""constitute a breach of the standards expected of individuals"" applying for prominent public appointments.""The public appointments process can only work effectively if everyone is open and transparent, yet Richard Sharp chose not to tell either the appointment panel or our committee about his involvement in the facilitation of a loan to Boris Johnson,"" said the committee's acting chair, Damian Green.The chair of the BBC is appointed based on the recommendation of the government of the day.Green added that the lack of transparency meant ""we were not in the full possession of the facts when we were required to rule on his suitability for the role of BBC chair.""Without formally calling for his resignation, the committee said Sharp should ""consider the impact his omissions will have"" on trust in the public broadcaster.Sharp, a former Goldman Sachs banker, has admitted that he introduced Sam Blyth, an old friend who wanted to help Johnson, to a government official in late 2020. He said his involvement went no further.Blyth, who is a distant cousin of Johnson, went on to make the loan to the former prime minister, UK media reported.Sharp appeared before the committee on Tuesday and reiterated that he was not involved in making a loan or in arranging a guarantee or any financing.He said after seeking an introduction for Blyth, he had agreed with a senior government official to have nothing more to do with the matter to avoid any conflict of interest.""Mr. Sharp appreciates that there was information that the committee felt that it should have been made aware of in his pre-appointment hearing,"" a spokesperson for Sharp said. ""He regrets this and apologizes.""Sharp also apologized again to the broadcaster's staff for the distraction caused to the BBC.Lisa Nandy, a shadow minister from the opposition Labour Party said Sharp's position was ""increasingly untenable.""""I think it's difficult to see how Richard Sharp could possibly stay in the position that he's in, given the far-reaching implications for the reputation of the BBC and the implications for trust in journalism,"" she told Sky News.Andrew Mitchell, a minister from the ruling Conservative government said it was up to the broadcaster to decide Sharp's future.""I think Damian Green is a very senior member of the House of Commons and what he and his committee says matters,"" Mitchell told the BBC.""But I think, as I say, this is really something which the public appointments commissioner must look at and we must wait for his judgment. And above all, of course, it's a matter for the judgment of the BBC.""Britain's public appointments watchdog is also reviewing Sharp's appointment.The chair is responsible for maintaining the independence of the BBC. He also appoints the director general and acts as the corporation's most senior representative to parliament and the government.Sharp was named as the preferred candidate for the job in January 2021.With material from ReutersEdited by: Darko Janjevic",2023/02/12,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808237,Germany sees shortage of graves for Muslim immigrants,"""More and more people want to be buried here,"" said Samir Bouaissa, referring to the increasing number of Muslims who want to be buried in Germany after they die. Over 5 million of Germany's 83 million inhabitants are Muslim, and the number is growing.Fifty-year-old Bouaissa was born in Morocco but moved to the western German town of Wuppertal 48 years ago. He is the chairman of the association Muslim Cemeteries Wuppertal, which is planning to set up the first cemetery in Germany run exclusively by Muslim communities.""We started it in Wuppertal in 2008,"" Bouaissa told DW. ""Even then it was clear that Germany needed Muslim burial grounds.""There are over 30,000 cemeteries in the country, one-third of which belong to Christian churches while the rest are run by municipalities. Each of the 16 federal states has extensive and distinct burial regulations.Bouaissa is a pioneer. More than six decades ago, the first so-called guest workers came to Germany from Turkey and then, in many cases, settled here for good. They held on to their religious and cultural traditions, but there were limited possibilities for Muslims to give their dead a proper burial in their new homeland.There were many legal obstacles, as well as extensive and sometimes heated debates until the first federal states modified burial requirements and abandoned the strict requirement of a coffin; both Jewish and Muslim traditions rely on burial in a cloth and rule out cremation or reburial altogether.In Germany, municipalities are required to provide burial fields or cemeteries wherever possible, but the competition for plots for Muslim graves cemeteries is fierce.In recent weeks, Berlin authorities warned that cemeteries are reaching or have already reached their capacity limits. And Bouaissa said that in many cities Muslims have had to find cemeteries in neighboring municipalities.Nearly every day at the Sehitlik Mosque in Berlin-Tempelhof, run by the Turkish-Islamic Union for Religious Affairs (DITIB), Muslims say farewell to their deceased relatives as an imam speaks the last prayers. Outside, parked hearses wait to take the coffins to the airport and onto a plane, often bound for Turkey.Many first-generation immigrants want to be buried in their country of origin, and for several decades, DITIB has offered ""funeral insurance"" that covers all the costs associated with the transfer to Turkey and burial there. Bouaissa told DW that Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria offer similar deals.The Federal Association of German Funeral Directors has also seen an increase in Muslim funerals. ""This is a good thing because the funeral culture is a mirror of society,"" Stephan Neuser, the association's secretary general, told DW. For years, the association has been calling for professional, standardized training for their trade, and Neuser believes this must include cultural considerations.The Turkish Cemetery Berlin is the oldest Muslim burial ground in Germany. It dates back to 1866, predating the founding of the German Empire in 1871. There are still some old gravestones that bear witness to this history.The cemetery reflects multicultural Berlin: There's a monument to German soldiers who died in World War I, next to graves of French soldiers, as well as German soldiers who served in southwestern Africa, the former German colony in what is now Namibia. But just a few steps away are gravestones inscribed with German transcriptions of Turkish or Arabic names like Ersin and Ibrahim, whose birthplaces were Istanbul, Beirut or Kabul.But space is also limited on this burial ground. In January, the Berlin Senate announced it was planning to open new grave sites for Muslim burials in 2023 in ""at least three more cemeteries.""Back in Wuppertal, Bouaissa, who is a local party representative of the center-right Christian Democratic Union as well as the chairman of the North-Rhine Westphalian branch of the Central Council of Muslims, is part of an initiative backed by all political parties in the city council.The proposal, to open the first cemetery in Germany run by Muslims, is to serve as a model. The location for the planned cemetery is close to the city's oldest Protestant cemetery and also a new Jewish cemetery. ""The three cemeteries are to share a forecourt with three funeral halls,"" said Bouissa. This could also serve as a meeting place for interested visitor groups, he added.That's the plan. But for 15 years, Bouaissa has been dealing with red tape: expert opinions have to be gathered on landscaping, wildlife protection and even soil management. Currently, the stability of the entire site is being checked after the flooding that also hit the Wupper valley in the summer of 2021.But Bouaissa believes matters will become even more urgent, given the hundreds of thousands of refugees who came to Germany in 2015 and 2016, mainly from Syria. ""In many cases, these are people who will have no possibility at all to return to their home countries,"" he said. That's why, eventually, they will also need to find burial sites in Germany.This article was originally written in German.",2023/02/12,,

            Over 250,000 people rallied in the city center, according to the central Spanish government. Organizers claimed the crowd was bigger by several hundred thousand. Many protest participants carried homemade signs with messages in Spanish like “The right to health is a human right. Defend the health service.”

            Health worker associations led the demonstration, which was backed by left-wing parties, unions and normal citizens concerned with what they see as the dismantling of the public health care system by the Madrid region's conservative-led government.











            These groups have taken to the streets on a regular basis in recent months, and their movement is gathering strength.

            Madrid’s regional chief, Isabel Díaz Ayuso, alleges the protests are motivated by the political interests of left-wing rivals ahead of May regional elections across most of Spain.

            Health care workers claim that Díaz Ayuso's administration spends the least amount per capita on primary health care of any Spanish region even though it has the highest per capita income. They say that for every 2 euros spent on health care in Madrid, one ends up in the private sector.

            Critics of her administration say that produces long waits for patients and overworked doctors and nurses.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808240,‘Magic Mike's Last Dance' wins Super Bowl weekend box office,"The third installment in the “Magic Mike” series danced its way to the top of the box office charts this weekend with a James Cameron double header, “Avatar: The Way of Water” and “Titanic” (yes that “Titanic”), looming close behind. 

            “ Magic Mike’s Last Dance ” earned $8.2 million in its first weekend in North American theaters, according to studio estimates on Sunday. Cameron's “Avatar” sequel brought in an additional $6.9 million while the 25th anniversary rerelease of “Titanic” took in $6.4 million from Friday to Sunday.

            North American moviegoing tends to come to a halt on Super Bowl Sunday and studios react strategically, often releasing films that are more “female-targeted.” Star Channing Tatum has also had several films perform well in the Super Bowl/Valentine’s Day corridor, including “The Vow,” “Dear John” and “Dog.”











            “This is not known as a spike the football weekend for theaters. But there are people who want to go to theaters, even on Super Bowl weekend,"" said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. “And this is perfect counterprogramming.""

            “Magic Mike’s Last Dance,” which brought Steven Soderbergh back to the director’s chair, was given a modest theatrical release in only 1,500 theaters. The film starring Tatum as the lovable male stripper and introducing a wealthy benefactor played by Salma Hayek, was made to go straight to HBO Max. But like the “ House Party ” reboot from several weeks ago, Warner Bros. pivoted and decided to go theatrical first with both in a company effort to refocus on the theatrical experience and give fresh fare to exhibitors. 

            The ”Magic Mike” franchise has been a profitable one. In 2012, the first film opened to some $39.1 million from just under 4,000 theaters, on its way to earning $167.3 million globally (against a $7 million production budget). The second, “XXL,” was made for slightly more ($14 million) and took in slightly less ($122.5 million) in 2015. The success of the films also spawned a Las Vegas stage show that has since expanded to Miami and London – in the lead up to the release of “Last Dance,” ticket sales for “Magic Mike Live” spiked too. 

            This latest installment reportly carried a much bigger production budget, around $40 million, according to entertainment trades. 

            “Avatar: The Way of Water” in its ninth weekend added $25.8 million globally, bringing its total earnings to $2.2 billion, holding its spot as the 4th biggest movie release ever but closing in on “Titanic.” 

            “Titanic” was rereleased in 2,464 domestic locations this weekend, with Paramount handling the North American release and The Walt Disney Co. on the international rollout in 51 territories. All told the film earned $22.3 million globally, with $2 million of that from IMAX screens. “Titanic” has now earned an estimated $2.2 billion globally, maintaining its title as the third biggest movie of all time. 

            In fourth place was the Super Bowl-themed “80 for Brady,” in its second weekend, with $6 million. The Paramount release has made just under $25 million so far. M. Night Shyamalan's “Knock at the Cabin,"" a Universal release, rounded out the top five with $5.5 million.

            “Super Bowl weekend is typically slow for theaters, and this one is no exception, but help is on the way with ‘Ant-Man,’” Dergarabedian said. “It'll start a chain reaction that should carry throughout the whole year.”

            The Marvel/Disney film “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” opens in theaters on Feb. 17.

            Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore, with Wednesday through Sunday in parentheses. Final domestic figures will be released Monday. 

            1. “Magic Mike’s Last Dance,” $8.2 million.

            2. “Avatar: The Way of Water,” $6.9 million.

            3. “Titanic,” $6.4 million.

            4. “80 for Brady,” $6 million.

            5. “Knock at the Cabin,” $5.5 million.

            6. “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,” $5.5 million. 

            7. “A Man Called Otto,” $2.6 million. 

            8. “Missing,” $2.6 million.

            9. “M3GAN,” $2.4 million.

But like the “ House Party ” reboot from several weeks ago, Warner Bros. pivoted and decided to go theatrical first with both in a company effort to refocus on the theatrical experience and give fresh fare to exhibitors.The ”Magic Mike” franchise has been a profitable one. In 2012, the first film opened to some $39.1 million from just under 4,000 theaters, on its way to earning $167.3 million globally (against a $7 million production budget). The second, “XXL,” was made for slightly more ($14 million) and took in slightly less ($122.5 million) in 2015. The success of the films also spawned a Las Vegas stage show that has since expanded to Miami and London – in the lead up to the release of “Last Dance,” ticket sales for “Magic Mike Live” spiked too.This latest installment reportly carried a much bigger production budget, around $40 million, according to entertainment trades.“Avatar: The Way of Water” in its ninth weekend added $25.8 million globally, bringing its total earnings to $2.2 billion, holding its spot as the 4th biggest movie release ever but closing in on “Titanic.”“Titanic” was rereleased in 2,464 domestic locations this weekend, with Paramount handling the North American release and The Walt Disney Co. on the international rollout in 51 territories. All told the film earned $22.3 million globally, with $2 million of that from IMAX screens. “Titanic” has now earned an estimated $2.2 billion globally, maintaining its title as the third biggest movie of all time.In fourth place was the Super Bowl-themed “80 for Brady,” in its second weekend, with $6 million. The Paramount release has made just under $25 million so far. M. Night Shyamalan's “Knock at the Cabin,"" a Universal release, rounded out the top five with $5.5 million.“Super Bowl weekend is typically slow for theaters, and this one is no exception, but help is on the way with ‘Ant-Man,’” Dergarabedian said. “It'll start a chain reaction that should carry throughout the whole year.”The Marvel/Disney film “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” opens in theaters on Feb. 17.Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore, with Wednesday through Sunday in parentheses. Final domestic figures will be released Monday.1. “Magic Mike’s Last Dance,” $8.2 million.2. “Avatar: The Way of Water,” $6.9 million.3. “Titanic,” $6.4 million.4. “80 for Brady,” $6 million.5. “Knock at the Cabin,” $5.5 million.6. “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,” $5.5 million.7. “A Man Called Otto,” $2.6 million.8. “Missing,” $2.6 million.9. “M3GAN,” $2.4 million.10. “Plane,” $1.2 million.—-Follow AP Film Writer Lindsey Bahr on Twitter: www.twitter.com/ldbahr.",2023/02/13,,World

            The Premier League also said it would treat the issue as a “matter of urgency.” 

            The game, which United won 2-0, was marred by some Leeds fans goading United supporters with chants about the Munich air disaster on Feb. 6, 1958. Some United supporters taunted the home crowd with chants about the death of Leeds fans in Istanbul in 2000. 











            “Both clubs strongly condemn chanting from both sets of fans regarding historic tragedies at today’s game,” Leeds and United said in a joint statement. “Such behavior is completely unacceptable and we will continue to work together with our respective fan groups and the Premier League and other authorities on eradicating it from football.”

            The Premier League echoed the condemnation. 

            “The League is treating the issue of tragedy chanting as a priority and as a matter of urgency,” it said. 

            The Munich crash resulted in the deaths of 23 people, including eight United players.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808250,"In Mexico, US complaints help union organizing efforts","MEXICO CITY (AP) — It has been nearly two years since the United States began pressing Mexico over labor rights violations by using rapid dispute resolution methods contained in the U.S.-Mexico Canada free trade agreement. 

            The administration of President Joe Biden has brought six such complaints and brags that, for the first time, someone is challenging Mexico’s anti-democratic, old-guard unions that have kept wages painfully low for decades.

            But workers and union organizers are mixed on the results, saying it’s hard to build a real union movement overnight, and that employers and old union bosses continue to resist change.











            The first complaint was filed in May 2021 about attempts by the Confederation of Mexican Workers (CTM) union to interfere with a vote at the GM plant in Silao, in the north-central state of Guanajuato. 

            Under the pressure of the U.S. complaint — which could eventually have led to trade sanctions — Mexican officials and observers oversaw a squeaky-clean union vote in which the old-guard CTM union was thrown out, and a new, independent union won the right to negotiate.

            The new union quickly won an 8.5% wage increase and more bonuses. 

            “On the economic side, the truth is the change came very quickly, though they were a little slow in giving us the increase,” said Manuel Carpio, a GM worker. Carpio credits the reformed Mexican labor laws and the pressure brought to bear under the USMCA complaint. 

            “I think that had a lot to do with it,” Carpio said.

            Before, pro-company unions signed contracts behind workers’ back, and employed thugs to keep workers from questioning the contracts, or relied on the company to fire dissidents. Carpio, an early union supporter, said that before, it was impossible to organize.

            “There was a lot of retaliation, but now we were protected by the law, that protected us a little, they couldn’t do as much against us,” he said. Before, “if we had tried to do it, heads would have rolled.”

            Which is not to say the problems are all solved; Carpio said the new union, known by it initials as SINTTIA, has a learning curve, and has been slow to hand out benefits derived from union dues. And autoworkers in Mexico still earn as little as $300 per month, or $12 per day. 

            The new union got the minimum increased to about $14 per day, but that's still less than a U.S. autoworker earns in an hour. The U.S. government hopes one day wages will equalize with the United States, stemming the outflow of manufacturing jobs, though that's not going to happen for a very long time.

            “That is very far away,” said José Guadalupe Alonso, a representative of the new union, who is still trying to cope with the fact that the old CTM union took everything down to the chairs and computers in union offices, and left the treasury bare.

            Alonso has no doubt that the U.S. labor complaints were key to getting the new union at GM.

            “What really made the difference here was that the U.S. government forces pressured to get certain things,” said Alonso.

            But Alonso says similar organizing efforts at other area plants, which have not attracted as much international attention, are still often as hard as ever. 

            For example, an organizing effort by the same union at a German plant making automotive pipes and tubing met resistance recently. Alonso said that when Mexican labor authorities tried to carry out an inspection at the plant, guards told them they had the wrong address.

            “Maybe we will have to submit another complaint to the U.S. government,” Alonso said.

            Mexico's Labor Department says it is committed to making the country's new labor laws work. The reforms guarantee workers the right to vote by secret ballots, see their contracts and periodically approve union leaders, all of which did not happen before. But Mexico still hasn't built the labor boards, inspectors and outreach that would make it all work. 

            But the U.S. labor complaints are no magic wand: the best example so far is the VU Manufacturing auto parts plant in the border city of Piedras Negras, Coahuila, 

            It is the only place where the United States has had to file not one, but two labor complaints under the USMCA, asking Mexico to ensure that it’s laws guaranteeing freedom to organize are being enforced. 

            The plant, located across the border from Eagle Pass, Texas, illustrates some of the uphill battles that organizers face in making union freedom a reality.

            The VU facility is largely staffed by women who often work 12-hour shifts assembling visors, armrests and dashboard parts for cars. Their base wage is about $15 per day.

            Piedras Negras is a relatively small, isolated border city where there is so little tradition of unions that the old-guard CTM union dominated the plant but never even bothered to ask the owners for a labor contract, says Pablo Franco, a Piedras Negras labor lawyer.

            After the U.S. filed a first labor complaint in July, the company was forced to allow a vote, but they let the CTM union inside to try to cow workers into rejecting the new union, the Mexican Workers Union League.

            “They spoke to the workers and they told them they couldn’t allow an outside union like the league in, that it would be better to go with the people they knew,” said Franco. “They (the company) spoke to workers, and allowed the CTM to speak to workers, to try to convince them. That was what the company did.”

            Even though the new union won a vote in late August by an almost two-to-one margin, the harassment hasn’t ceased, and the company has been loathe to negotiate, said union organizer Julia Quiñonez, a Piedras Negras labor activist.

            Quiñonez has been the target of a number of social media videos in which workers at the plant were allowed to leave the factory — in their company uniforms — and hold a press conference attacking the new union for asking too much in terms of wage increases: a scandalous $32 per day.

            “No company can do that,” said one of the dissidents in the video. “Not even the owner has that much (money).”

            Quiñonez disputes that — she says the new union is only asking for $19 per day — but says the company has refused to negotiate, and has allied with the CTM union to launch a smear campaign against the union.

            “They say we are egging the workers on to ask for more than the companies can give, so they will close down and return to the United States,” Quiñonez says.

            The company also allegedly severely limited the new union's access to hold an assembly in the plant, and refused to hand over information as part of the negotiations.

            VU Manufacturing did not respond to requests by phone and email for comment.

            The situation drew an unprecedented second U.S. complaint on Jan. 30.

            ""Despite this facility taking positive actions in 2022, some of the failures we identified previously appear to be recurring.” said U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai.

            Mexico’s Labor Department said in a statement “VU Manufacturing is obligated to negotiate in good faith” with the new union and “must allow its representatives and advisors to enter the facility, participate in negotiations and inform the workers.”MEXICO CITY (AP) — It has been nearly two years since the United States began pressing Mexico over labor rights violations by using rapid dispute resolution methods contained in the U.S.-Mexico Canada free trade agreement.The administration of President Joe Biden has brought six such complaints and brags that, for the first time, someone is challenging Mexico’s anti-democratic, old-guard unions that have kept wages painfully low for decades.But workers and union organizers are mixed on the results, saying it’s hard to build a real union movement overnight, and that employers and old union bosses continue to resist change.The first complaint was filed in May 2021 about attempts by the Confederation of Mexican Workers (CTM) union to interfere with a vote at the GM plant in Silao, in the north-central state of Guanajuato.Under the pressure of the U.S. complaint — which could eventually have led to trade sanctions — Mexican officials and observers oversaw a squeaky-clean union vote in which the old-guard CTM union was thrown out, and a new, independent union won the right to negotiate.The new union quickly won an 8.5% wage increase and more bonuses.“On the economic side, the truth is the change came very quickly, though they were a little slow in giving us the increase,” said Manuel Carpio, a GM worker. Carpio credits the reformed Mexican labor laws and the pressure brought to bear under the USMCA complaint.“I think that had a lot to do with it,” Carpio said.Before, pro-company unions signed contracts behind workers’ back, and employed thugs to keep workers from questioning the contracts, or relied on the company to fire dissidents. Carpio, an early union supporter, said that before, it was impossible to organize.“There was a lot of retaliation, but now we were protected by the law, that protected us a little, they couldn’t do as much against us,” he said. Before, “if we had tried to do it, heads would have rolled.”Which is not to say the problems are all solved; Carpio said the new union, known by it initials as SINTTIA, has a learning curve, and has been slow to hand out benefits derived from union dues. And autoworkers in Mexico still earn as little as $300 per month, or $12 per day.The new union got the minimum increased to about $14 per day, but that's still less than a U.S. autoworker earns in an hour. The U.S. government hopes one day wages will equalize with the United States, stemming the outflow of manufacturing jobs, though that's not going to happen for a very long time.“That is very far away,” said José Guadalupe Alonso, a representative of the new union, who is still trying to cope with the fact that the old CTM union took everything down to the chairs and computers in union offices, and left the treasury bare.Alonso has no doubt that the U.S. labor complaints were key to getting the new union at GM.“What really made the difference here was that the U.S. government forces pressured to get certain things,” said Alonso.But Alonso says similar organizing efforts at other area plants, which have not attracted as much international attention, are still often as hard as ever.For example, an organizing effort by the same union at a German plant making automotive pipes and tubing met resistance recently. Alonso said that when Mexican labor authorities tried to carry out an inspection at the plant, guards told them they had the wrong address.“Maybe we will have to submit another complaint to the U.S. government,” Alonso said.Mexico's Labor Department says it is committed to making the country's new labor laws work. The reforms guarantee workers the right to vote by secret ballots, see their contracts and periodically approve union leaders, all of which did not happen before. But Mexico still hasn't built the labor boards, inspectors and outreach that would make it all work.But the U.S. labor complaints are no magic wand: the best example so far is the VU Manufacturing auto parts plant in the border city of Piedras Negras, Coahuila,It is the only place where the United States has had to file not one, but two labor complaints under the USMCA, asking Mexico to ensure that it’s laws guaranteeing freedom to organize are being enforced.The plant, located across the border from Eagle Pass, Texas, illustrates some of the uphill battles that organizers face in making union freedom a reality.The VU facility is largely staffed by women who often work 12-hour shifts assembling visors, armrests and dashboard parts for cars. Their base wage is about $15 per day.Piedras Negras is a relatively small, isolated border city where there is so little tradition of unions that the old-guard CTM union dominated the plant but never even bothered to ask the owners for a labor contract, says Pablo Franco, a Piedras Negras labor lawyer.After the U.S. filed a first labor complaint in July, the company was forced to allow a vote, but they let the CTM union inside to try to cow workers into rejecting the new union, the Mexican Workers Union League.“They spoke to the workers and they told them they couldn’t allow an outside union like the league in, that it would be better to go with the people they knew,” said Franco. “They (the company) spoke to workers, and allowed the CTM to speak to workers, to try to convince them. That was what the company did.”Even though the new union won a vote in late August by an almost two-to-one margin, the harassment hasn’t ceased, and the company has been loathe to negotiate, said union organizer Julia Quiñonez, a Piedras Negras labor activist.Quiñonez has been the target of a number of social media videos in which workers at the plant were allowed to leave the factory — in their company uniforms — and hold a press conference attacking the new union for asking too much in terms of wage increases: a scandalous $32 per day.“No company can do that,” said one of the dissidents in the video. “Not even the owner has that much (money).”Quiñonez disputes that — she says the new union is only asking for $19 per day — but says the company has refused to negotiate, and has allied with the CTM union to launch a smear campaign against the union.“They say we are egging the workers on to ask for more than the companies can give, so they will close down and return to the United States,” Quiñonez says.The company also allegedly severely limited the new union's access to hold an assembly in the plant, and refused to hand over information as part of the negotiations.VU Manufacturing did not respond to requests by phone and email for comment.The situation drew an unprecedented second U.S. complaint on Jan. 30.""Despite this facility taking positive actions in 2022, some of the failures we identified previously appear to be recurring.” said U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai.Mexico’s Labor Department said in a statement “VU Manufacturing is obligated to negotiate in good faith” with the new union and “must allow its representatives and advisors to enter the facility, participate in negotiations and inform the workers.”",2023/02/13,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808252,"After quake, war-hit Syrians struggle to get aid, rebuild","ATAREB, Syria (AP) — After years of war, residents of areas in northwest Syria struck by a massive earthquake are grappling with their new and worsening reality.

            Almost one week after the devastating 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck northern Syria and neighboring Turkey, the United Nations has acknowledged an international failure to help Syrian quake victims.

            In Atareb, a town that Syrian rebels still hold after years of fighting government troops, survivors dug through the debris of their homes Sunday, picking up the remnants of their shattered lives and looking for ways to heal after the latest in a series of humanitarian disasters to hit the war-battered area.











            Excavators lifted rubble and residents with shovels and picks destroyed columns to even out a demolished building.

            Dozens of newly displaced families gathered for hot meals from local volunteers and the local opposition-run government. A private citizen went tent to tent to give out wads of cash in a makeshift shelter — the equivalent of about $18 to each family. 

            Syrians were doing what they have honed over years of crises: relying on themselves to pick up the pieces and move on. 

            “We are licking our own wounds,” said Hekmat Hamoud, who had been displaced twice by Syria’s ongoing conflict before finding himself trapped for hours beneath rubble.

            Syria's northwestern rebel-held enclave, where over 4 million people for years have struggled to cope with ruthless airstrikes and rampant poverty, was hit hard by the Feb. 6 quake.

            Many in the area were already displaced from the ongoing conflict and live in crowded tent settlements or buildings weakened by past bombings. The quake killed over 2,000 people in the enclave, and displaced many more for a second time, forcing some to sleep under olive groves in the frigid winter weather.

            “l lost everything,” said father of two Fares Ahmed Abdo, 25, who survived the quake. But his new home and body shop where he fixed motorcycles for a living were destroyed. Once again with barely any shelter and no power nor toilets, he, his wife, two boys and ill mother are crammed in a small tent. 

            “I am waiting for any help,"" he said.

            Visiting the Turkish-Syrian border Sunday, U.N. Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Martin Griffiths acknowledged in a statement that Syrians have been left “looking for international help that hasn’t arrived.”

            “We have so far failed the people in north-west Syria. They rightly feel abandoned,” he said. “My duty and our obligation is to correct this failure as fast as we can.”

            Northwest Syria relies almost entirely on aid for survival, but post-quake international assistance has been slow to reach the area. The first U.N. convoy to reach the area from Turkey was on Thursday — three days after the earthquake. 

            Before that, the only cargo coming across the Bab al-Hawa crossing on the Turkey-Syria border was a steady stream of bodies of earthquake victims coming home for burial — Syrian refugees who had fled the war in their country and settled in Turkey but perished in the quake.

            The U.N. aid sent from Turkey to Syria is only authorized to enter via the Bab al-Hawa crossing, and logistics were complicated by pressure on the roads, many of them destroyed by the quake. While technically, international aid can also be sent from Syrian government-held areas to rebel-held areas in the northwest, that route brings its own set of hurdles and was at best a trickle.

            Critics of the government of President Bashar Assad say aid funneled through government-held areas in Syria faces bureaucracy and the risk that authorities will misappropriate or divert the aid to support people close to the government.

            A convoy carrying U.N. aid that was scheduled to cross Sunday into rebel-held Idlib from the government area was canceled after its entry was blocked by the the Qaida-affiliated rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which dominates the area. An administrative arm of the group said in a statement declined to receive assistance from government areas. 

            Strips of northern Syria are held by a patchwork of sometimes-conflicting groups, further hindering aid deliveries. Turkish-backed rebels have blocked aid convoys from reaching earthquake victims that were sent by rival U.S.-backed Kurdish groups in neighboring areas.

            “We are trying to tell everyone, put politics aside. This is the time to unite behind the common effort to support the Syrian people,"" said Geir Pedersen, the U.N. special envoy for Syria who landed in Damascus on Sunday.

            At the United Nations, U.S. envoy Linda Thomas-Greenfield called for an urgent U.S. Security Council vote to authorize the opening of additional cross-border passages into northwestern Syria."" People in the affected areas are counting on us,"" she said in a statement. “They are appealing to our common humanity to help in their moment of need. We cannot let them down.”

            While aid has been slow to reach the northwest, a number of countries that had cut ties with Damascus during Syria's civil war have sent help to government areas. Arab countries including Egypt and the United Arab Emirates have stepped in. UAE's foreign minister visited Damascus and met with Assad on Sunday.

            Raed al-Saleh, the head of the White Helmets, a civil defense group operating in the rebel-held northwest, said Griffiths' visit was “too little, too late.” He said calls for international assistance by local rescue teams went unheeded for days “and during this time, countless lives have been needlessly lost.”

            Al-Saleh met with Griffiths to demand the opening of additional cross-border routes for aid to enter without waiting for authorization from the U.N. Security Council.

            Abdel-Haseeb Abdel-Raheem sifted through the rubble of his aunt’s destroyed four-story building in the town of Atareb in opposition-run northern Aleppo. He had pulled the bodies of his aunt and her husband from beneath the rubble hours after the quake. Now he went back to find any valuables, using his hands and dipping his body inside the skeleton of the destroyed building to pull out blankets and pillows, as well as some clothes.

            The 34-year-old said he had no illusion that humanitarian assistance will solve his problems.

            “We have no hope anymore,” he said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808263,England gives Borthwick first win after smothering Italy,"LONDON (AP) — Rebuilding England returned to its traditional strengths to give new coach Steve Borthwick his maiden win and smother Italy 31-14 in the Six Nations on Sunday.

            England responded to being sliced apart by Scotland last weekend by outmuscling the Italians, pinning them in their half for long periods, and swarming all over them. 

            The focused home side had the result in hand by halftime at 19-0 up. The second half loosened up but a penalty try gave them the four-try bonus point and they capped the scoring with a first try for wing Henry Arundell, considered England’s next big thing.











            “We've taken some steps forward,” Borthwick said. “Our ruck speed could have been quicker. When our ruck speed went up, we stressed the defense more. When it slowed down, we didn't.”

            Italy has never beaten England but, after pushing France close, came to Twickenham wearing danger signals. But everything Italy coach Kieran Crowley worried about was borne out: England was direct, unified, and the defense was solid.

            “We need to work on a more structured and effective Plan B that we can use when our Plan A fails,” Crowley said. “We are the most penalized team in terms of scrums in this Six Nations, so we need to understand how to improve.”

            Borthwick's team changes paid off, especially flanker Jack Willis, the first France-based England player in the Six Nations in 11 years. He scored the opening try in a standout 53-minute shift. The new midfield of Ollie Lawrence — named man of the match — and Henry Slade got over the gainline, and captain Owen Farrell back at flyhalf controlled the match well thanks to the ride provided by his forwards.

            Their dominance was so strong, notably in the first half, that Farrell elected not to take any penalty goalkicks. Instead, he targeted the corner for lineouts five times and England got tries from three. Another try originated from a tap penalty, and Arundell was put over in the corner by another replacement, scrumhalf Alex Mitchell.

            Italy got tries from prop Marco Riccioni and replacement scrumhalf Alessandro Fusco, but little else went right. The scrum was a liability, and the attack often went lateral in a struggle to break England's rush defense. Captain Michele Lamaro was lost to a thigh injury in the first quarter and they played a man short for 20 minutes after yellow cards to No. 8 Lorenzo Cannone and replacement prop Simone Ferrari.

            Cannone's yellow in the first half after persistent fouling by Italy was particularly costly. England used its command over a pack it was already on top of to score two tries with the man advantage.

            Willis opened the scoring with a too-easy try off a lineout drive. His roar of delight and the glee of his teammates spoke to his overcoming adversity.

            In this fixture two years ago, Willis scored a try as a replacement but moments later he was carried off after a crocodile roll tore his left knee. He was out for 53 weeks. When his Wasps club went into bankruptcy in October, he was hired by Toulouse. The circumstances give him special dispensation to be picked for England.

            After Cannone was sin-binned, a tapped penalty led to England lock Ollie Chessum scoring. Then Jamie George was driven over from a lineout maul and they led 19-0.

            Italy rallied to lead France from 19-6 down, and started the new half with 18 phases finished by Riccioni driving past three defenders to score. But that was Riccioni's last act in a rough first test in 15 months. His replacement, Ferrari, was then sin-binned for collapsing a lineout maul which conceded the penalty try.

            Fusco's converted try brought Italy to 26-14 but Arundell sealed England's 30th straight win against the frustrated visitors.

            England goes to Wales next in two weeks. Italy will host unbeaten Ireland.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808264,Motie takes 7-37 as Zimbabwe out for 115; West Indies 133-4,"BULAWAYO, Zimbabwe (AP) — West Indies left-arm spinner Gudakesh Motie took seven wickets to help dismiss Zimbabwe for 115 in the second test before the visitors finished the first day on 133-4 for an 18-run lead.

            The hosts were missing batter Gary Ballance through illness and their first innings lasted only 40.5 overs on Sunday after choosing to bat first. Opener Innocent Kaia top scored with 38.

            Motie took full advantage of the spin-friendly conditions at Queens Sports Club, relying on turn of the ball, variation and change of pace for his career-best bowling figures of 7-37 in 14.5 overs.











            “It’s a great feeling, it means a lot to me,” the 27-year-old Guyanese said. “I really enjoyed bowling in these spin-friendly conditions. Hopefully we can get a good total tomorrow.”

            Motie's seven victims were Zimbabwe interim captain Craig Ervine (22), Milton Shumba (3), Tafadzwa Tsiga (0), Wellington Masakadza (1), Brandon Mavuta (1), Victor Nyauchi (2) and Tanaka Chivanga (6).

            Zimbabwe’s batting lineup, weakened by the absence of all-rounder Sikandar Raza and regular captain Sean Williams, was dealt another blow after former England batter Ballance, who scored a historic century on debut last week, was ruled out because of migraine.

            “Look, it’s a challenge not having your senior guys — Sikandar (Raza), Sean (Williams) and now Gary Ballance after the way he batted in the first test,” Ervine said.

            “It’s challenging but, like I’ve said before, it’s opportunities for others. It’s a privilege for them to play test cricket and see how it’s like.”

            Left-hander Raymon Reifer (53) led his side’s reply with a half century, and shared a second-wicket partnership of 73 with opener Tagenarine Chanderpaul (36). 

            “It’s a great feeling, we want to build a lead as big as possible,” Reifer said.

            Reifer, who was run out after a mix-up with Chanderpaul, said it was ""disappointing not to be coming back tomorrow to get that hundred.”

            Zimbabwe’s slow bowlers were also relatively successful in the conditions, with Mavuta and Masakadza sharing the other three wickets.

            Ervine defended his decision to bat first.

            “When we looked at the wicket we knew it was going to turn,” Ervine said. “West Indies hit the right areas and made it difficult for us to score. 

            ""We chose to bat first because the wicket was dry and batting last was going to be difficult. We are hoping to keep their lead under 100 runs.”

            The first of two tests was drawn.

Opener Innocent Kaia top scored with 38.Motie took full advantage of the spin-friendly conditions at Queens Sports Club, relying on turn of the ball, variation and change of pace for his career-best bowling figures of 7-37 in 14.5 overs.“It’s a great feeling, it means a lot to me,” the 27-year-old Guyanese said. “I really enjoyed bowling in these spin-friendly conditions. Hopefully we can get a good total tomorrow.”Motie's seven victims were Zimbabwe interim captain Craig Ervine (22), Milton Shumba (3), Tafadzwa Tsiga (0), Wellington Masakadza (1), Brandon Mavuta (1), Victor Nyauchi (2) and Tanaka Chivanga (6).Zimbabwe’s batting lineup, weakened by the absence of all-rounder Sikandar Raza and regular captain Sean Williams, was dealt another blow after former England batter Ballance, who scored a historic century on debut last week, was ruled out because of migraine.“Look, it’s a challenge not having your senior guys — Sikandar (Raza), Sean (Williams) and now Gary Ballance after the way he batted in the first test,” Ervine said.“It’s challenging but, like I’ve said before, it’s opportunities for others. It’s a privilege for them to play test cricket and see how it’s like.”Left-hander Raymon Reifer (53) led his side’s reply with a half century, and shared a second-wicket partnership of 73 with opener Tagenarine Chanderpaul (36).“It’s a great feeling, we want to build a lead as big as possible,” Reifer said.Reifer, who was run out after a mix-up with Chanderpaul, said it was ""disappointing not to be coming back tomorrow to get that hundred.”Zimbabwe’s slow bowlers were also relatively successful in the conditions, with Mavuta and Masakadza sharing the other three wickets.Ervine defended his decision to bat first.“When we looked at the wicket we knew it was going to turn,” Ervine said. “West Indies hit the right areas and made it difficult for us to score.""We chose to bat first because the wicket was dry and batting last was going to be difficult. We are hoping to keep their lead under 100 runs.”The first of two tests was drawn.___More AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/02/13,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808265,Caribbean leaders to tackle Haiti's woes amid migration,"GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) — Top Caribbean leaders are expected to debate Haiti's spiraling chaos and its impact on the region during a biannual meeting this week, with some complaining bitterly about a constant stream of migrants arriving on their shores as they flee poverty and worsening violence.

            The three-day meeting of the Caribbean trade block known as Caricom starts Wednesday in the Bahamas. 

            Some of the group’s 15 members are pushing to get key Haitian stakeholders to a neutral nation in the region to reach a consensus agreement on holding elections in the impoverished country that has been stripped of all democratically elected institutions.











            However, the international community and local officials have noted that elections cannot be held in Haiti until violence is quelled.

            Haiti’s foreign minister, Jean Victor Généus, warned during an Organization of American States meeting Friday that insecurity has risen and will spill over into neighboring countries.

            “We must absolutely tackle this problem in Haiti because no one else in the Caribbean will be spared,” he said.

            The Caricom meeting will be hosted by Bahamian Prime Minister Philip Davis, who has persistently complained about the cost of repatriating thousands of Haitians as well as hundreds of Cubans in the past year. He says Caricom needs to help find a solution to Haiti’s security, political and economic crisis.

            Violence has soared in Haiti as poverty and hunger deepens, with gangs growing more powerful since the July 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moïse. The number of reported kidnappings rose to more than 1,200 last year, more than double what was reported the previous year. Meanwhile, 1,200 killings were reported last year, an increase of 35% compared with the previous year, according to the U.N.

            The violence, coupled with double-digit inflation, has prompted thousands to flee Haiti to neighboring Caribbean islands, with many seeking to eventually reach the U.S. Dozens have died in such attempts as they cram into rickety boats captained by human smugglers.

            The International Organization for Migration announced last month that it documented at least 321 migrant deaths and disappearances in the Caribbean last year, the highest number recorded since 2014 and a spike compared with the 180 deaths registered in 2021. 

            Last year, the Bahamas repatriated nearly 5,000 migrants, the majority of them Haitians. In January, the government sent home 570 migrants, of whom 368 were Haitians. The government of the Turks & Caicos Islands intercepted more than 3,000 such migrants last year.

            In late January, the Bahamian government announced that no new work permit applications for Haitians would be processed until authorities could better authenticate documents issued by Haiti's government. Also that month, the Turks & Caicos government approved a six-month moratorium on visitor visas for Haitians.

            Both governments have complained about an increase in migrant shantytowns and on spending related to patrolling waters surrounding both archipelagos.

            “There is no question as to whether Haiti will be discussed” at this week's meeting, Caricom spokesman Leonard Robertson said. “Haiti has been at the front and center of the community’s interest and agenda.”

            Critics say Caricom has failed to produce a more managed approach to Haiti’s situation.

            “We are either all brothers on one ship or not,” said Mark Kirton, an author and former professor at the University of the West Indies. “We need a strong, sustained intervention from Caricom as Haiti is a member. … This has been severely lacking.” 

            Earlier this month, Jamaica’s prime minister said he was willing to send soldiers and police officers to Haiti as part of a proposed multinational security assistance deployment. Last year, the Bahamas said it would send troops or police if asked to do so.

            Since October, Haitian Prime Minister Ariel Henry and top officials have requested the immediate deployment of foreign troops. However, the U.N. Security Council has not addressed the request, opting instead to implement sanctions.

            On Friday, the United Nations Integrated Office in Haiti released a report recommending that Caricom accelerate efforts to control the illegal proliferation of firearms and ammunition in the Caribbean.

            Two 19-year-olds, Nikeal Franklin and Jy’Shaun Jackson, were arrested Friday, the Baton Rouge Police Department said. Franklin was charged with 12 counts of attempted first-degree murder while Jackson was charged with 12 counts of principal to attempted first-degree murder.

            On Jan. 22, shots rang out around 1:30 a.m. in the Dior Bar & Lounge in Baton Rouge. A dozen people were injured, and most sustained non-life-threatening injuries. Three victims were initially listed in critical condition, but their conditions later improved. 











            Police said they believe the shooting was not a random act of violence and that it was “targeted.” Sgt. L’Jean McKneely Jr., a police spokesman, told The Associated Press in the days following the shooting that investigators believed the shooting was targeted at one partygoer and that bystanders were hurt in the process.

            Before the shooting, the nightclub had advertised a Southern University and Louisiana State University-themed party as the two schools kicked off new semesters. Spokespeople for both LSU and Southern University told The Advocate that the event at the club that evening in Baton Rouge was not affiliated with either school.

            In a social media post Friday, police said the investigation was ongoing and did not release any details beyond an announcement of the arrests. 

            Although the number of homicides in Baton Rouge decreased last year from 2021, Louisiana’s capital city has been plagued by gun violence. In October, an early-morning shooting near Southern University’s campus in Baton Rouge left nine people injured.

            The 16-year-old suspect charged in the Dec. 16 shooting outside Benito Juarez High School asked one of the victims about his gang affiliation before he opened fire, Assistant State's Attorney Thomas Darman said during the suspect's bail hearing Saturday.

            A Cook County judge denied his bail and said life in prison is a possibility. The suspect was charged as an adult with two counts of first-degree murder and two counts of attempted murder. He also faces juvenile weapon charges.

            After the suspect was arrested at his home Thursday and officers served a search warrant, they found four guns, all loaded and with extended magazines, Darman said. Three of the guns also had switches that made them fully automatic.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808271,AP source: Eagles' Steichen leads Colts' coaching candidates,"PHOENIX (AP) — Philadelphia Eagles offensive coordinator Shane Steichen is the leading candidate to be the next head coach of the Indianapolis Colts, a person familiar with the team’s decision told The Associated Press.

            The person spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity Sunday because Steichen is coaching the Eagles in the Super Bowl against the Chiefs and a deal hasn’t been completed.

            Steichen, who was one of three finalists for AP Assistant Coach of the Year, would become the second Eagles offensive coordinator hired by the Colts as their head coach. Frank Reich, who was fired by the Colts earlier this season, was Philadelphia’s offensive coordinator before becoming Indianapolis’ head coach in 2018.











            The Colts have been impressed by Steichen's ability to help develop Jalen Hurts, who was a finalist for the AP NFL MVP and AP Offensive Player of the Year awards.

            The Colts fired Reich in early November after a third straight loss and replaced him with Jeff Saturday on an interim basis. After winning his first game, Saturday and the Colts lost their last seven to finish 4-12-1.

            Saturday, a former two-time All-Pro center who snapped the ball to Hall of Fame quarterback Peyton Manning for 12 seasons with the Colts, had been working as an ESPN analyst when the Colts brought him in to replace Reich.

            Saturday was a candidate for Indianapolis’ permanent position. He was among those who got a second interview. Reich was hired last month as head coach of the Carolina Panthers.

            Reich's offensive coordinator in Indy from 2018-2020 was Nick Sirianni, who led the Eagles to the Super Bowl in just his second season as a head coach.

            At the end of a week when the defending champions were accused of breaching a slew of financial regulations, Guardiola's players issued a defiant response on the field by beating Aston Villa 3-1. 

            Another win at Arsenal on Wednesday and City will move to the top of the Premier League for the first time since August and wipe out the eight-point gap that separated the teams as recently as Jan. 19. 











            It is a turnaround that hardly looked likely when City lost 1-0 to Tottenham last week in a match that saw Guardiola bench star player Kevin de Bruyne in his attempts to get his team's title defense on track. 

            But Arsenal has also been stuttering — dropping five points over the last two weeks, including the 1-1 draw with Brentford on Saturday — to give hope to rivals City and Manchester United.

            If Arsenal fans hoped City's latest legal fight to clear its name would be a distraction, the evidence on Sunday was more that it could have a galvanizing effect. 

            The home crowd at the Etihad Stadium jeered the Premier League anthem before kickoff and sang songs about its owners, Abu Dhabi's ruling family. 

            And it only took four minutes for the team to give fans something to cheer when Rodri opened the scoring. 

            Ilkay Gundogan scored a second in the 39th and Riyad Mahrez hit a third from the penalty spot in the first minute of stoppage time at the end of the half. 

            Ollie Watkins pulled one back for Villa in the 61st, but the job was effectively done by the break. Guardiola could even afford to take off leading scorer Erling Haaland and Ruben Dias at halftime as his thoughts likely turned to that midweek trip to Emirates Stadium and a top-of-the-table clash with Arsenal. 

            Arsenal will have its work cut out to keep City at bay if Guardiola’s team produces a performance as ruthless as its first-half display. 

            City’s players looked like they had a point to prove after Guardiola said on Friday that the club had already been condemned as a result of the latest accusations of financial wrongdoing. 

            After successfully overturning a two-year ban issued by UEFA, the club says it will clear its name again. But Guardiola believes damage to City's reputation has already been done. 

            Guardiola said Friday that he was even more determined to stay in his role after the accusations and build on the success of seven years at the club, which have seen him deliver four Premier League titles and five more major trophies. 

            Yet City’s title defense has come into question this season in the face of Arsenal’s outstanding form. 

            Guardiola suggested his team had lost its edge after dominating in recent years and the 1-0 loss to Tottenham was in keeping with an inconsistent campaign. 

            On Sunday Guardiola got the response he’s been looking for as City aims to prove itself both on and off the field.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808274,Israel's president urges Netanyahu to delay legal overhaul,"JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel's president on Sunday appealed to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to delay a contentious plan to overhaul the country's judicial system and instead seek a compromise with his political opponents.

            President Isaac Herzog issued the appeal in a prime-time nationwide address a day before Netanyahu's coalition is to take its first steps toward implementing the plan in parliament.

            The proposed reforms have triggered mass demonstrations and opposition from wide swaths of Israeli society. Even President Joe Biden has offered veiled criticism, saying Sunday that Israel's democracy is built on consensus and an independent judiciary.











            “I feel, we all feel, that we are in a moment before a collision, even a violent collision, a barrel of explosives before a blast,” Herzog said.

            Herzog's job is largely ceremonial. But the president is meant to serve as a moral compass and unifying force, and his words can carry great weight in a deeply divided country. 

            There was no immediate response from Netanyahu. 

            Netanyahu and his supporters say the proposed changes are needed to rein in a judiciary that wields too much power.

            But his critics say the plan, which include proposals to weaken Israel's Supreme Court, will damage the country’s fragile system of democratic checks and balances. They also say that Netanyahu, who is on trial for corruption charges, is motivated by a personal grudge against the legal system and has a deep conflict of interest. Netanyahu has said he is a victim of a witch hunt.

            “They want to destroy the system because the system wasn’t nice to them,” said Eliad Shraga, chairman of the Movement for Quality Government in Israel. “This is a hostile takeover by a bunch of crooks.” 

            Shraga's movement has planned a mass demonstration outside the Knesset, or parliament, on Monday, when Netanyahu's coalition is expected to introduce the first legislation for its sweeping overhaul. Tens of thousands of people are expected to attend.

            Herzog urged Netanyahu to put off Monday's vote and begin dialogue with his opponents, including the president of Israel's Supreme Court. Saying that both sides have valid points, he offered a five-point plan as a basis for dialogue.

            “An agreement can be reached,” Herzog said, offering to assist with negotiations.

            “Any way you choose. Any time you choose, so long that we move on to a constructive and sustainable discourse and abandon the deceiving, insulting and dismissive discourse,” he said.

            Israeli media quoted Netanyahu's justice minister, Yariv Levin, who has led the charge for the proposed overhaul, as saying he was open to dialogue but would not delay the legislation. However, Channel 12 TV quoted anonymous officials as saying the government would delay a preliminary vote by one week.

            Opposition leader Yair Lapid called Herzog's suggestions a “reasonable framework.”

            Netanyahu’s proposals call for a series of sweeping changes aimed at curbing the powers of the judiciary.

            On Monday, a parliamentary committee is expected to approve legislation on a plan that would give lawmakers the power to appoint judges. Under the current system, appointments are made by a committee that includes lawyers, lawmakers and judges.

            A second proposal being introduced this week aims to take away the Supreme Court’s authority to review “Basic Laws” — which serve as a sort of constitution — approved by parliament. 

            Another proposal in the works would give parliament the power to overturn decisions by the Supreme Court. 

            Critics say that taken together, this package of changes would weaken the independence of the judiciary and give absolute power to the country’s most right-wing government in history. They expect the campaign to eventually result in the dismissal of the criminal charges against Netanyahu.

            The proposals have triggered unprecedented opposition. Tens of thousands of people have gathered in Tel Aviv and other cities each Saturday night over the past six weeks. 

            Influential groups, including high-tech executives, retired military brass, former judges and attorneys general and national security advisers, and teachers and students have all protested the plan.

            On Sunday, Biden weighed in on the debate, making a rare foray by an American president into domestic Israeli affairs.

            “The genius of American democracy and Israeli democracy is that they are both built on strong institutions, on checks and balances, on an independent judiciary,” Biden told the New York Times. “Building consensus for fundamental changes is really important to ensure that the people buy into them so they can be sustained.”

            Committee approval will send the legislation to the full parliament for the first of three votes of approval — a process that is expected to take several months.

            But it would reflect a determination by Netanyahu and his allies to press ahead in the face of deep divisions in Israeli society. Netanyahu has accused his opponents of incitement against him.

            Critics say the plan is putting the country on an authoritarian path similar to the democratic backsliding that has taken place in Poland and Hungary.

            Amir Fuchs, a senior researcher at the Israel Democracy Institute, a Jerusalem think tank, said the proposed legal overhaul could lead to a heavily politicized judiciary that is loyal to the prime minister and loses its traditional oversight over the legislative branch.

            In sum, the overhaul could open the way for the ruling party or coalition in government to pass any laws they chose unchecked, he warned.

            “They will have total power. They will have the power in order to enact anything,” he said.JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel's president on Sunday appealed to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to delay a contentious plan to overhaul the country's judicial system and instead seek a compromise with his political opponents.President Isaac Herzog issued the appeal in a prime-time nationwide address a day before Netanyahu's coalition is to take its first steps toward implementing the plan in parliament.The proposed reforms have triggered mass demonstrations and opposition from wide swaths of Israeli society. Even President Joe Biden has offered veiled criticism, saying Sunday that Israel's democracy is built on consensus and an independent judiciary.“I feel, we all feel, that we are in a moment before a collision, even a violent collision, a barrel of explosives before a blast,” Herzog said.Herzog's job is largely ceremonial. But the president is meant to serve as a moral compass and unifying force, and his words can carry great weight in a deeply divided country.There was no immediate response from Netanyahu.Netanyahu and his supporters say the proposed changes are needed to rein in a judiciary that wields too much power.But his critics say the plan, which include proposals to weaken Israel's Supreme Court, will damage the country’s fragile system of democratic checks and balances. They also say that Netanyahu, who is on trial for corruption charges, is motivated by a personal grudge against the legal system and has a deep conflict of interest. Netanyahu has said he is a victim of a witch hunt.“They want to destroy the system because the system wasn’t nice to them,” said Eliad Shraga, chairman of the Movement for Quality Government in Israel. “This is a hostile takeover by a bunch of crooks.”Shraga's movement has planned a mass demonstration outside the Knesset, or parliament, on Monday, when Netanyahu's coalition is expected to introduce the first legislation for its sweeping overhaul. Tens of thousands of people are expected to attend.Herzog urged Netanyahu to put off Monday's vote and begin dialogue with his opponents, including the president of Israel's Supreme Court.

            The distinctive jumpsuit, designed by Harri, had inflatable arms and legs that quickly became the most buzzed about look of the night, trumping Harry Styles’ black velvet suit with its giant satin organza flower around his neck. 

            Smith’s look, which included black platform heeled boots, had its fans, but also inspired some to take to social media to make jokes about UFOs and Billy Connolly’s “incontinence pants” come to life. Others wondered if it was an homage to one of David Bowie’s most memorable looks, the shiny, pinstripe jumpsuit with ballooning legs designed by Kansai Yamamoto that Bowie wore in 1973.











            The designer of Smith’s outfit, Harri, told WWD that the look was intended to celebrate the natural form and “the beauty of being one’s self.”

            “Sam was having a lot of hate comments recently after ‘Unholy’ about (their) body image,” Harri said. “I wanted to create an image which people have never seen Sam in.” 

            Last week, Smith, who goes by they/them pronouns, praised stylist Ben Reardon on Instagram, writing that he’s behind much of what they’ve worn over the past few years in videos and on red carpets.

            “Ben, your talent and your vision is unprecedented in my life,” Smith wrote. “You have taught me so much and re-introduced me to art and creativity in a way that I never thought was possible.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808278,"Barça wins 11th straight game, opens 11-point lead in Spain","MADRID (AP) — Barcelona keeps on winning at the top of the Spanish league and moving further away from Real Madrid.

            Barcelona beat Villarreal 1-0 on the road on Sunday to extend its winning streak to 11 matches in all competitions and its lead over second-place Madrid to 11 points. 

            Madrid, which won the Club World Cup on Saturday, has played a game less than Barcelona.











            “There is nothing decided yet, there is still a lot of league left,” Barcelona coach Xavi said. “But we are happy because we are on a great run, doing things well.”

            It was the 16th clean sheet for Barcelona in 21 league matches this season.

            Pedri scored in the 18th minute for Barcelona, whose 1-1 draw against Espanyol in the league on Dec. 31 was the last time it failed to win. The 11-game streak has included beating Real Betis on penalties in the Spanish Super Cup and an extra-time victory in the Copa del Rey against Intercity.

            It was the third straight loss for eighth-place Villarreal, which has only one win in its last six matches in all competitions. Its previous defeat was at last-place Elche, which had been winless in the league.

            Villarreal started the game without injured striker Gerard Moreno, and it lost midfielder Francis Coquelin with a knee injury in the first half. The Frenchman had to be carried off the field on a stretcher.

            Barcelona was playing without captain Sergio Busquets and winger Ousmane Dembélé because of injuries. Xavi used midfielder Frenkie de Jong and forward Raphinha in their places.

            Defender Marcos Alonso started on the bench a few days after the death of his father, former Barcelona player Marcos Alonso.

            Barcelona next hosts Manchester United in the Europa League on Thursday. 

            DEPAY, OBLAK LEAD ATLETICO

            Memphis Depay scored in the 88th minute for his first goal since joining from Barcelona as 10-man Atletico Madrid won 1-0 at Celta Vigo to stay fourth in the final Champions League spot.

            Atletico needed a good performance from goalkeeper Jan Oblak and some help from the woodwork after defender Stefan Savic was sent off in the 70th. 

            Atletico opened a four-point gap to fifth-place Betis with its third win in four league matches. Celta, which was coming off two straight wins, dropped to 14th.

            “It was a tough match, we knew Celta was going through a good moment,” Atletico coach Diego Simeone said. “In the end, Oblak helped us again and Memphis came through in a very important match for us.”

            Depay scored from inside the area for his first goal with Atletico since arriving in a transfer from Barcelona in January.

            Oblak made two outstanding stops after Savic was sent off, including a reflex save on the goal line in the 85th. 

            Veteran Celta striker Iago Aspas hit the crossbar from the free kick that came after Savic’s red card for stopping a breakaway.

            Midfielder Koke Resurrección made his 402nd appearance with Atletico in the league, surpassing the club mark by former midfielder Adelardo Rodríguez. 

            GETAFE RECOVERS

            Second-to-last Getafe earned a hard-fought 1-1 draw against Rayo Vallecano thanks to a 77th-minute equalizer by Enes Unal and Rayo striker Raúl de Tomás failing to score from the penalty spot in the 87th, only four minutes after entering the match. 

            Getafe, winless in seven consecutive matches in all competitions, played with 10 men from the 54th after Carles Aleñá was sent off with a second yellow card.

            Getafe striker Borja Mayoral also failed to score with a penalty kick shortly before Aleña was sent off.

            Rayo, which had won three of its last four league matches, dropped to sixth place with the away draw.

            OSASUNA HELD AGAIN

            Osasuna’s winless streak in the league reached four matches after a 0-0 draw at 13th-place Valladolid, which was coming off two straight victories following five consecutive losses in all competitions.

            Osasuna, which stayed ninth, has only one win in its last eight league matches.

            On Monday, third-place Real Sociedad visits relegation-threatened Espanyol looking to end a three-game winless streak and move closer to second-place Madrid.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808279,Hertha beats Gladbach 4-1 for 1st Bundesliga win of 2023,"BERLIN (AP) — Hertha Berlin defender Marton Dárdai scored on his 21st birthday in a morale-boosting 4-1 win over Borussia Mönchengladbach to help the team’s bid for Bundesliga survival on Sunday.

            “That was the best birthday yet,"" Dárdai said after making his first appearance for Hertha this year.

            Hertha had only scored one goal in its previous four games this year – all defeats – but the team came back from Nico Elvedi’s early score for Gladbach with goals from Jessic Ngankam, Dárdai, Derry Scherhant and Dodi Lukebakio to climb one place above Stuttgart and into the league’s relegation playoff place. The bottom two are relegated automatically.











            Hertha coach Sandro Schwarz said before the game he was switching to three at the back with five in midfield instead of the usual 4-3-3 formation, but he can’t have been happy with his team’s defense when former Hertha defender Luca Netz sent in a corner for Elvedi to open the scoring with a header in the 17th.

            The visitors dominated possession and looked to be in total control until Ngankam equalized in the 30th. Tolga Ciğerci sent Marco Richter through with a clever drag-back and Richter crossed for Ngankam to score from close range.

            Dárdai scored early in the second half, rewarding Hertha’s pressure with a fierce shot from outside the penalty area that went in off the underside of the crossbar near the right post.

            “It was a bit surreal the way it went perfectly into the corner,"" Dárdai said. “Simply a nice day today.”

            It was Dárdai’s first Bundesliga goal, scored with his father — former Hertha player and coach Pál Dárdai — watching with other family members among the fans.

            Hertha substitutes Scherhant and Lukebakio both scored in injury time – the latter with a penalty – to seal Hertha’s first win of 2023, dropping Gladbach down to 10th.

            Hertha next visits Borussia Dortmund, which has won all six games across all competitions this year. 

            COLOGNE CARNIVAL

            Ellyes Skhiri scored twice for Cologne to beat Eintracht Frankfurt 3-0 and dent the visitors’ Champions League qualification hopes.

            Frankfurt had been hoping to go fourth — the last qualification spot for Europe’s top club competition — but slumped to its first defeat of the year.

            The visitors might have had a penalty when Eric Martel struck the ball with his upper arm, before Randal Kolo Muani failed to make the most of a good chance in the 25th. The French forward had scored in each of his previous four games for Frankfurt.

            Cologne improved drastically after the break. Timo Hübers scored with a glancing header in the 49th and Skhiri grabbed two more.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808284,AP source: Cavaliers close to deal with veteran Danny Green,"CLEVELAND (AP) — The Cleveland Cavaliers are trying to finalize a contract agreement with veteran swingman Danny Green, a person familiar with the negotiations told The Associated Press on Sunday.

            A three-time NBA champion, Green began his pro career with Cleveland in 2009.

            The 35-year-old Green will sign with the Cavaliers if the sides can “work through details,” according to the person who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because the team is not commenting on its interest in him.











            Green posted about his status on Twitter, saying, “It's not done yet ... .”

            A well-respected player, Green would give the young Cavs another outside shooter and bring more postseason experience to a team trying to get back to the playoffs for the first time since 2018. He has appeared in 165 playoff games.

            Cleveland has won six straight and currently is the No. 4 seed in the Eastern Conference standings.

            Green became available after working out a contract buyout from Houston, which acquired him at the trade deadline from Memphis. He played in just three games with the Grizzlies this season after tearing knee ligaments during the playoffs last season with the Philadelphia 76ers.

            The Cavaliers didn't make any moves at the deadline, but president of basketball operations Koby Altman said the team would explore the buyout market.

            Green has averaged 12.4 points and 4.9 rebounds over 14 seasons with the Cavs, Spurs, Raptors, Lakers, Sixers and Grizzlies.

            He has made 39.9% percent of his career 3-pointers. Green played college ball at North Carolina.

            Inter Milan can cut the gap to Napoli to 13 points with a win at Sampdoria on Monday. Cremonese remained rock bottom of Serie A, 11 points from safety.











            Cremonese pulled off a big upset when it won at Napoli on penalties in the Italian Cup last month. It then went on to eliminate Roma and reach the semifinals for only the second time in its history.

            But it hadn’t won in the league all season and its chances of getting anything from Sunday’s match diminished in the 22nd minute.

            Defender Leonardo Sernicola tried to head a cross away for a corner but it fell to Kvaratskhelia, who cut inside from the left, carved out some space and drilled across into the far corner.

            Osimhen had scored in his last five matches and he made it six straight with probably the easiest of his 17 league goals this season. Cremonese goalkeeper Marco Carnesecchi managed to get a hand to Giovanni Di Lorenzo’s header from a corner but Kim Min-jae’s diving header turned into an assist for Osimhen to tap in from practically on the goal line.

            Elmas netted in the 79th, with an angled drive into the far bottom corner, eight minutes after coming off the bench.

            DISALLOWED GOALS

            Still reeling from a massive points penalty, Juventus inched closer to the final European qualifying spot in Serie A with a 1-0 win at fierce rival Fiorentina.

            Adrien Rabiot netted the only goal of the match in the first half and both sides had a goal ruled out for offside, including what would have been a late leveler for Fiorentina.

            Juventus — which was hit by a 15-point penalty for false accounting last month — moved to within one point of seventh-place Torino and the Europa Conference League qualifying berth. Fiorentina, which could have leapfrogged the Bianconeri with a win, was five points further back.

            Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri decided to unleash the superstar trident of Ángel Di María and former Fiorentina players Dušan Vlahović and Federico Chiesa.

            The match was fiery from the start but it took until the 34th minute for the deadlock to be broken. 

            A cross was cleared but only to Di María on the right side of the area and he floated the ball back in for Rabiot to head in at the back post. Fiorentina goalkeeper Pietro Terracciano clawed the ball away but the goal-line technology informed the referee that it had already crossed.

            Vlahović thought he had doubled his side’s lead on the hour mark and he made a big show of not celebrating against his former club but the goal was ruled out as he was marginally offside on Filip Kostić's through ball.

            Gaetano Castrovilli had an equalizer ruled out a minute from time. After reviewing the goal on the pitchside monitor, the referee adjudged that Luca Ranieri was offside and interfering with play in the buildup.

            FASTEST GOAL

            Destiny Udogie netted the fastest goal in Serie A this season but it was not enough for his team to win as Udinese drew 2-2 against Sassuolo.

            Udogie scored after just 25 seconds but it was almost immediately canceled out as Matheus Henrique equalized in the sixth minute.

            The strike had taken a deflection off Jaka Bijol but the Udinese defender made up for it in the 28th when he slid in to prod Lazar Vujadin Samardžić's free kick home.

            However, Sassuolo leveled again on the stroke of halftime as Udinese defender Nehuén Pérez turned the ball into his own net.

            Udinese moved level on points with Torino. Monza won 1-0 at Bologna to leave both teams a point behind Udinese.

(AP) — Cardi B teamed with her husband Offset onstage, embraced Serena Williams and later partook with a lively crowd during the rapper’s energetic pre-Super Bowl concert in suburban Phoenix. 

            The Grammy winner joyfully danced and performed her biggest jams from “Up” to “I Like It” at the Hall of Fame party early Sunday. She brought high energy into a laid-back nightclub atmosphere at the Gila River Resorts & Casino in Chandler, Arizona.

            The crowd rose to their feet and pulled out their phones to capture Cardi B's show as they recited almost word-for-word all the lyrics during her 30-minute set. She kicked off her performance with “Money” as she pranced across the stage.











            “How are we doing tonight?” she asked the enthusiastic concertgoers. “I need to take a shot… Do I look good? Yeah. Let’s get it poppin’.”

            After Cardi B’s quick speech, Offset joined her onstage to perform their hit “Clout.” She amped the crowd while her husband rapped his verse before she returned the favor and finished the song. 

            Cardi B went on to perform her other hits such as “WAP,” “Finesse” and “Bodak Yellow,” her final song of the night. Afterward, she shook her hips then hugged Williams onstage before the rapper ventured offstage and marched with her security through a sea of audience members, which included comedian Tiffany Haddish, who cheered her on and took selfies and videos of her.

            Earlier, Offset opened up for his wife, performing “Roc Flair Drip,” “Taste” and played a snippet of “Bad and Boujee” from his former group Migos.CHANDLER, Ariz.

            Filip Rebraca added 16 points and eight rebounds for Iowa (16-9, 8-6 Big Ten). 

            The Hawkeyes, who had their three-game win streak snapped by an 87-83 loss at No. 1 Purdue last time out, never trailed against Minnesota.











            Tony Perkins hit a jumper to open the scoring, then followed with a three-point play to spark an 18-6 opening run that included six points by Rebraca. The Gophers cut their deficit to two points on three occasions — the last coming when Joshua Ola-Joseph hit a 3-pointer that made it 39-37 with 16:53 — but got no closer. 

            Murray hit a 3-pointer and then threw down a dunk to cap a 10-1 run that gave Iowa a 66-52 lead with 2:54 to play.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808301,"Harris scores twice, Montreal beats Edmonton 6-2","MONTREAL (AP) — Jordan Harris had his first career two-goal game and the Montreal Canadiens earned wins on back-to-back afternoons with a 6-2 victory over the Edmonton Oilers on Sunday.

            Alex Belzile, Josh Anderson, Rafael Harvey-Pinard and Christian Dvorak added goals for Montreal. Evgenii Dadonov and Jonathan Drouin each recorded two assists. Jake Allen made 30 saves.

            “It’s not only the result, it’s how we won that’s important,” Montreal coach Martin St. Louis said. “We keep trying to build, there’s a lot of engagement and a big buy-in from the guys to keep playing together offensively and defensively. The break helped us but I think it’s a progression.”











            Leon Draisaitl and Evander Kane scored for Edmonton. Connor McDavid ended a 15-game point streak. Stuart Skinner made 24 saves as the Oilers recorded their first regulation loss in 12 games. They were on a 9-0-2 run heading into Sunday’s contest.

            Belzile opened the scoring for the Canadiens with his first NHL goal at 8:14 of the opening frame, taking advantage of some confusion between Oilers defenseman Brett Kulak and Skinner and scored on a wrist shot from the high slot.

            Montreal doubled its lead in the second period when Dadonov found Harris with a pass from behind Skinner’s net. Anderson gave the Habs a commanding 3-0 lead on the power play when he grabbed a rebound from Dadonov’s shot and tapped in his 15th of the campaign.

            “The (defensemen) are hot right now, hopefully we can keep it up,” Harris said. “But I feel like it really starts with us defending. I feel like we’ve done a good job defending and jumping up on the rush and I feel like a lot of our D-men have those skill-sets to make plays offensively.”

            Edmonton woke up from a slow opening frame with two goals in the second period. Draisaitl hopped on a Zach Hyman rebound to score 30th goal of the season on the power play.

            The Oilers then cut their deficit to one when Kane surprised Allen with a swift wrist shot from the right face off circle. But Montreal nipped Edmonton’s comeback attempt in the bud by bumping their lead back to two goals late in the second period when Harvey-Pinard redirected Mike Matheson’s slap shot. 

            “I thought both teams got what they deserved,” Oilers coach Jay Woodcroft said. “Montreal played a very good game, credit to them, and I didn’t think we were very sharp at all so we got what we deserved.”

            Harris completed his two-goal game at 2:58 of the final period by beating Skinner with a wrister from the left faceoff circle.

            BELZILE MAKES HISTORY

            At 31 years and 165 days old, Belzile became the oldest Canadien to score his first NHL goal since Hockey Hall of Famer Herb Gardiner in 1926. Belzile also became the seventh-oldest player in league history to get a goal.

            Belzile received an ovation from the crowd. 

            “It was unbelievable,” Belzile said. “I’ve watched it in my head many times, and recently I had scoring chances as well, but I kept convincing myself that it’s gonna come for real. There’s a lot of mental behind it and I’m just so so so happy and so glad that it happened.""

            St. Louis said he was happy for Belzile: “A lot of people will never reach their full potential because they give up a little too early ... I know he scored today but he also had an impact (on the game).”

            HOMECOMING

            One of the few happy moments for Edmonton was reserved for defenseman Vincent Desharnais, who played his first game in his home province in front of a group of 40 friends and family members.

            “I appreciated it a bit more in warmups,” Desharnais said. “I saw my brother, my niece, but when the game starts, it’s an arena like any other and I have to do my job.”

I know he scored today but he also had an impact (on the game).”HOMECOMINGOne of the few happy moments for Edmonton was reserved for defenseman Vincent Desharnais, who played his first game in his home province in front of a group of 40 friends and family members.“I appreciated it a bit more in warmups,” Desharnais said. “I saw my brother, my niece, but when the game starts, it’s an arena like any other and I have to do my job.”UP NEXTOilers: Host Red Wings on Wednesday.Canadiens: Host Blackhawks on Tuesday.___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/02/13,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808303,No. 8 Maryland rallies in second half to beat Illinois 82-71,"COLLEGE PARK, Md. (AP) — When it came time for Brenda Frese's Maryland players to rate their performance at halftime, there was a bit of a disconnect between them and their coach.

            “They rate themselves a little higher than what I (did),” Frese said. “That was called out.”

            Whatever was said during that break, the eighth-ranked Terrapins looked like a different team afterward, dominating the third quarter on their way to an 82-71 victory over Illinois on Sunday. Diamond Miller scored 31 points, and the Terps rallied from an 11-point second-quarter deficit.











            “Halftime was what halftime needed to be,” Miller said. “I think that fired us up, and when we came back out, we came out playing good defense and just executing on both sides of the court.”

            Abby Meyers scored 14 of her 18 points in the third quarter for the Terrapins, who improved to 13-0 all-time against the Illini. This victory was in doubt for a while, though. Maryland (21-5, 12-3 Big Ten) missed all 17 of its 3-point attempts but was able to come back thanks to its tenacious pressure defense.

            Down 37-28 at halftime, the Terps outscored Illinois 31-8 in the third. The Illini had more turnovers (10) than field goal attempts (nine) in the quarter.

            “The concern obviously, playing them, is their pressure,” Illinois coach Shauna Green said. “We handled it fine until that third quarter, when we didn't handle it fine, and they made us pay by getting a ton of baskets off of our turnovers.”

            Meyers' three-point play put Maryland ahead 46-43. After a couple free throws by Illinois' Makira Cook, the Terps scored the final 13 points of the period. A steal and layup by Miller put Maryland up by five, and then Shyanne Sellers stole the ball and passed to Meyers for a layup.

            With about a minute to go in the quarter, Cook's pass sailed right to Green on the sideline. She bounced the ball in apparent frustration. Moments later, following another turnover, Meyers made a layup while being fouled, and the free throw made it 59-45.

            Illinois (19-7, 9-6) made all five of its 3-point attempts in the first quarter and went 12 of 22 beyond the arc in the game. Cook scored 29 points but had nine of her team's 25 turnovers.

            Illinois was playing without guard Genesis Bryant, the team's second-leading scorer. Only six Illini players appeared for more than 3:13 and only seven played at all.

            “It's a huge challenge to not have one of your starting point guards,” Green said. “For us to kind of get to that next level, we've got to be able to handle pressure.”

            BIG PICTURE

            Illinois: The Illini did a nice job slowing Maryland down in the first half, but their inability to hold onto the ball gave the Terps way too many easy baskets. Maryland finished with a 30-13 edge in fast break points.

            Maryland: It says a lot that the Terps ended up winning fairly comfortably despite being outscored 36-0 beyond the arc. Maryland's ability to get out and run makes this team dangerous even when Miller isn't getting much help in the half-court offense.

            BOTH EXTREMES

            While Maryland missed every 3-pointer it took, the Terps were also a perfect 18 for 18 on free throws. And they outscored Illinois 56-12 in the paint.

            “It started defensively with our press,"" Frese said. ""(Sellers), who was struggling a little bit in that first half — I really challenged her and Diamond at halftime. Those two really needed to step up our energy for the defensive end.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808304,Title-chasing Arsenal faces double threat from Manchester,"MANCHESTER, England (AP) — If Arsenal is to win its first Premier League title in 19 years, it will have to hold off a growing double threat from Manchester. 

            The battle to be crowned English champions looks set to come down to just three clubs after wins for Manchester City and Manchester United on Sunday tightened the gap at the top of the table.

            
                Defending champion City beat Aston Villa 3-1 and has the chance to move above leader Arsenal on goal difference with a win when the sides meet on Wednesday.











            United is now five points off the top after beating Leeds 2-0 at Elland Road.

            But the immediate threat to Arsenal, which has led the standings since August, is a City team that has the chance to wipe out an eight-point deficit that existed less than a month ago, even if it has played a game more.

            “We will see after all the games when the Premier League is finished. But we are going to London to try to get a win,” City manager Pep Guardiola said. “When one team has made 50 points in the first leg (half of the season) it is because they are very good. We closed the gap today because the performance from the team was really, really good.” 

            The wins for City and United will increase the sense of injustice felt by Arsenal at Ivan Toney's equalizer against Mikel Arteta's team in a 1-1 draw with Brentford on Saturday. 

            
                Referees chief Howard Webb contacted the club to explain “significant"" and “human” error after VAR failed to rule Toney's goal out for offside, but that is likely to be of little comfort to a team whose title challenge is beginning to show signs of faltering. 

            Rodri, Ilkay Gundogan and Riyad Mahrez all scored in the first half as City issued a defiant response on the field following accusations this week of breaching financial regulations. 

            While City is primed to challenge, United has also emerged as a serious contender — even if manager Erik ten Hag may yet rue the dropped points in a 2-2 draw with Leeds midweek. 

            His team at least got the better of its rival from Yorkshire when meeting for a second time in the space of four days. 

            Even then United left it late, with Marcus Rashford opening the scoring in the 80th minute and substitute Alejandro Garnacho adding a second goal in the 85th. 

            It was Rashford's 21st goal of the season and his 13th in his last 15 games. And with Cristiano Ronaldo departed and Anthony Martial enduring ongoing fitness issues, the England forward is vital to United's ambitions. 

            Ten Hag said Rashford was now “definitely one of” the best in Europe. 

            “He has the skills. I was convinced from the first moment. I was really excited to work with him. I thought I could get more out of him,"" he said. “But he has so many skills, such high potential and I think there can be even more. When he works well, he will even score more goals because he can score with his left, right and his head.” 

            HAALAND PENALTY MYSTERY

            Erling Haaland has scored 31 goals in 28 appearances for City, but was denied No. 32 when overlooked for penalty duty against Villa. 

            The Norway international is City's first choice from the spot, but had to make way for Riyadh Mahrez when his team was awarded a penalty late in the first half, which even caught Guardiola by surprise. 

            “I need to talk to them,” Guardiola said. ""Normally Erling is the first taker and Riyad is the second one. Rodri was involved so we will see what they say tomorrow.”

            Haaland was substituted at halftime after taking a kick, with Guardiola unsure if he will be available against Arsenal. 

            Ollie Watkins pulled one back for Villa in the 61st.

            DE GEA'S LANDMARK

            David de Gea made his 400th Premier League appearance in Manchester United's win against Leeds. 

            For the goalkeeper, however, the victory was more important than his personal landmark. 

            “Today wasn’t about that, it was about winning the game and we did it so now I can enjoy the 400 Premier League games,” he said. ""It’s great to come here, play like we did today. Clean sheet, three massive points and 400 games, perfect day.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808305,Pelicans' Williamson has setback with hamstring injury,"METAIRIE, La. (AP) — New Orleans Pelicans All-Star Zion Williamson has aggravated his previously injured right hamstring, extending the timeline for his return to “multiple weeks past All-Star break,” basketball operations chief David Griffin said Sunday.

            Griffin said Williamson, who has been averaging 26 points per game this season, had progressed to the point where he was able to participate in 3-on-3 drills in practice and was on the court when he experienced his setback.

            When asked how Williamson handled the setback emotionally, Griffin said, “it's fair to say not terribly well because he was really diligent in his rehab.”











            “Unfortunately this is an injury that has a very high incidence of recurrence,” Griffin said. “It's nothing he did wrong to bring this about. ... It's an injury that's tricky and hard to navigate. I think you've seen other players around the league have those same re-incidences. It's not unique.""

            Williamson has missed 20 straight games since his initial hamstring injury on Jan. 2. If he misses the first two weeks after the All-Star break, he' will have been out at least 27 games.

            Without Williamson, the Pelicans have gone 12-16, but a number of those games were played while high-scoring wing Brandon Ingram also was out.

            Ingram is now back in the lineup and has scored 25 or more points in each of his past four games.

            The Pelicans enter Monday night's game at Oklahoma City having won three of four, with the lone loss in that stretch coming against surging Cleveland, which is on a six-game winning streak.

            The silver lining for the Pelicans is that they have virtually the same core players available now that they had during their playoff run last spring, when Williamson was recovering from a foot injury that sidelined him for all of last season.

            The Pelicans also made a move at last week's NBA trade deadline that sent 6-foot-1 reserve guard Devonte' Graham to San Antonio for veteran 6-5 guard Josh Richardson, who is in his eighth season and is expected to help New Orleans defensively.

            New Orleans is 29-28, placing it seventh in the Western Conference entering Sunday.

            “We all feel for Z, having to navigate these injuries,” Pelicans coach Willie Green said. ""It's an opportunity for guys to kind of band together and go out and play our best basketball.

            Green, who played in the NBA for 12 seasons, said it will be important for Williamson to “get into a good mental space” now.

            “It's going to be important for him to continue to attack the rehab to give himself an opportunity to get back on the floor,” Green said. “For the rest of the guys. ... We've created a standard. We know how we want to play. Guys have to do it and we all have to kind of come together while Z is out.”

            The run the Pelicans made last spring without Williamson “helps our confidence,” Green said.

            “It gives us not only the belief but the results to know that we can do it,” Green said. “We just got continue to go do the things we know we're capable of.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808310,Baby bonanza: Chiefs' Allegretti welcomes Super Bowl twins,"PHOENIX (AP) — The Kansas City Chiefs welcomed two new fans to the world on Super Bowl Sunday with a third apparently on the way.

            Chiefs offensive lineman Nick Allegretti's wife, Christina, gave birth in the early hours to twin girls back home in Chicago, a team official confirmed to The Associated Press. Allegretti was able to watch everything unfold on FaceTime from the lobby of the team hotel while the rest of the Chiefs slept ahead of their game against the Philadelphia Eagles.

            Allegretti, who has started three games this season, will be available for the Chiefs in the big game.











            About the same time his wife was giving birth, Chiefs wide receiver Mecole Hardman tweeted that his girlfriend, Chariah Gordeon, had gone into labor. Hardman went on injured reserve this week and was not available to play in the game.

            There are plenty of Eagles on baby watch, too.

            Starting center Jason Kelce, whose brother Travis is a tight end for Kansas City, and his wife are expecting their third child at any moment. In fact, Kylie Kelce, who is 38 weeks pregnant, has said that her obstetricians would be on hand at State Farm Stadium on Sunday should the baby make a dramatic appearance during the game.

            “We haven't talked too much game plan if it happens during the Super Bowl,” Jason Kelce said, ""but I like to think my wife will not tell me. And just find a way to hold off, hopefully 'til after the game for the actual delivery.

            “You know, we're going to have her OB with her here. Our parents are coming along on the trip so she won't be alone,” Kelce said, “but I think if it happens during the game, just don't even — don't even put that in my head please.”

            Rams wide receiver Van Jefferson had that happen to him just last year.

            After helping Los Angeles beat the Cincinnati Bengals to win the Lombardi Trophy, Jefferson learned that his wife, Samaria, had gone into labor and was taken out of the stadium on a stretcher. Jefferson bolted from the postgame celebration with his father, former NFL player Shawn Jefferson, and made it to the hospital to meet his son.

            The couple appropriately named him Champ.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808311,Schwartz scores twice in Kraken's 4-3 win over Flyers,"PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Jaden Schwartz scored twice, Jordan Eberle had a goal and an assist and the Seattle Kraken sapped some of Philadelphia’s Super Bowl Sunday excitement with a 4-3 victory over the Flyers.

            Eeli Tolvanen also scored and Philipp Grubauer made 18 saves for the Kraken, who snapped a three-game losing streak. Seattle entered in fourth place in the Pacific Division and two points out of third.

            Eberle said Seattle sorely needed the win. 











            “Anytime you’ve lost three in a row, especially coming out of the break, you start doubting yourself a bit,” he said. “Ultimately, you come back and you just get a win and you start moving forward.”

            James van Riemsdyk, Owen Tippett and Patrick Brown scored for the Flyers. Philadelphia completed a homestand with its third loss in four games.

            “I just don’t think we were on,” Flyers coach John Tortorella said. 

            Serving as the appetizer for Sunday night’s Super Bowl featuring the Philadelphia Eagles versus the Kansas City Chiefs, the pregame had a party atmosphere. Flyers players entered the arena wearing Eagles jerseys, matching many fans’ choice of Eagles apparel. Defensemen Travis Sanheim and Tony DeAngelo sported Eagles winter caps during warmups, and Eagles legend Vince Papale pounded the drum before the opening faceoff.

            The video board was lit up in green and “Go Birds” scrolled across the screen. Longtime national anthem singer Lauren Hart donned a Jalen Hurts jersey and PA announcer Lou Nolan wore an Eagles baseball hat. 

            There were eight “E-A-G-L-E-S!” chants in the first period, and the hometown fans were enthused when Tippett snapped an 0-for-13 team skid on the power play with a close-range goal 2:11 into the contest to put the Flyers ahead 1-0.

            But Philadelphia didn't take a shot in the final 16:35 of the first period, and the Kraken made them pay with goals by Eberle and Tolvanen.

            The teams traded tallies in the second period before Schwartz gave Seattle a 4-2 lead with his second of the contest just a minute into the third. The Kraken second-line forward was all alone in the right circle and fired a wrist shot over goalie Felix Sandstrom’s right shoulder.

            Sandstrom, Philadelphia’s backup to Carter Hart, made 15 saves while falling to 1-8-1.

            It appeared Schwartz’s second goal would be plenty of breathing room for Seattle, especially after Travis Konecny was sent to the box for a delay-of-game penalty late in the third. But Brown converted a short-handed tally with an unlikely goal on a slap shot from the side boards.

            The Kraken withstood the Flyers’ furious 6-on-5 rally effort in the final 1:35.

            “Other than the third period, we did a pretty good job,” Schwartz said. “Once we got up by two, we were on our heels a little bit. But big to get back in the win column.”

            Schwartz broke a 2-all tie with 1:01 left in the second with his first tally when his wrist shot from the slot through a screen beat Sandstrom on the blocker side.

            Van Riemsdyk tied it at 2-all 3:33 into the second, deflecting Tippett’s initial shot, which hung in mid-air. As if he was a batter across the street at Citizens Bank Park, van Riemsdyk used a backhand swing to swat the waist-high puck past Grubauer.

            “Certain plays they capitalized on and obviously some miscues by us,” van Riemsdyk said. “They were on us quick and made it tough on us.”

            FINAL TALLY

            Philadelphia fans finished with 24 Eagles chants.

            NOTES

            Former Flyers coach Dave Hakstol made his second appearance back in Philadelphia since being fired on Dec. 17, 2018. … The teams will meet again Thursday in Seattle. … The Kraken improved to 17-8-2 on the road.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808315,Houston-area shelter-in-place lifted after ammonia leak,"KATY, Texas (AP) — A shelter-in-place advisory issued in suburban Houston because of a leak of ammonia gas from a refrigeration line at a warehouse was lifted early Sunday afternoon, officials said.

            Officials said at a news conference that while air monitoring would continue around the 99 Cents Only Store distribution center in Katy, there wasn't currently a health risk. No injuries were reported.

            Emergency responders were called to the warehouse just before 9 p.m. Saturday because of the leak of anhydrous ammonia from an overhead refrigeration line, Harris County Emergency Services District 48 Fire Chief George McAteer said. He said the refrigeration system had been undergoing maintenance.











            Initially, the leak was contained to the building, but around 1 a.m. Sunday, air monitoring showed it was leaking out of the 800,000-square-foot (74,322 square meters), Harris County Fire Marshal Laurie Christensen said.

            Officials said that it was initially too dangerous for crews to be inside the building because of the flammability of the gas and the respiratory effects from it, but by early afternoon, it had been determined that the tanks had bled off and only residual amounts of ammonia were left.

            Harris County Public Health said it issued the shelter in place advisory Sunday morning for the 2 square miles (5 square kilometers) out of an abundance of caution.

            Exposure to high concentrations of ammonia in the air can cause burning of the eyes, nose, throat and respiratory track, and can result in blindness, lung damage or death, health officials say, while exposure to lower amounts can result in coughing and irritation of the nose and throat.KATY, Texas (AP) — A shelter-in-place advisory issued in suburban Houston because of a leak of ammonia gas from a refrigeration line at a warehouse was lifted early Sunday afternoon, officials said.Officials said at a news conference that while air monitoring would continue around the 99 Cents Only Store distribution center in Katy, there wasn't currently a health risk.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808316,"Brink, Emma-Nnopu lead No. 6 Stanford by Arizona State 96-64","TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) — Agnes Emma-Nnopu had a career-high 17 points and Cameron Brink had 15 points and eight rebounds despite playing only 12 minutes to help No. 6 Stanford to a lopsided 96-64 victory over Arizona State in a Pac-12 game Sunday afternoon.

            Emma-Nnopu made five 3-pointers and Hannah Jump added 12 points, making four from behind the arc. Each made four three-pointers in the first half. The Cardinal (24-3, 12-2 Pac-12) were 12 of 23 from distance, with nine makes in the first half. 

            “Tag-team basketbalI,"" Brink said. “Everyone contributed. Everyone played really well.”











            Guard Tyi Skinner had 23 points for the Sun Devils (7-16, 0-14), who have lost 14 in a row. 

            Freshman Lauren Betts had 13 points and Kiki Iriafen had 12 points in 13 minutes for the Cardinal, who played reserves the majority of the game. Haley Jones had two points, five rebounds, five assists and four blocked shots in 21 minutes. 

            “We had a lot of different people contributing,” Stanford coach Tara VanDerveer said. “We have to play this way, where you play hard for awhile, then you come in. Our depth was a real factor. You could be physical.”

            Stanford had a 58-35 rebounding edge and had 19 second-chance points. The Cardinal had 28 assists on 35 field goals while shooting 46.1 percent. Arizona State shot 33.3 percent. 

            “They were just relentless,” Arizona State coach Natasha Adair said. “Knowing their role, knowing that is what they needed to do. They are really good at that and balanced across the board. That is another bonus to why they are as talented as they are.”

            Jump made three three-pointers in the first five minutes and Stanford went on a 9-0 run midway through the first quarter for a 21-7 lead that grew to 29-13 at the end of quarter. 

            “It's always nice to see your first one go in,” said Jump, who has a team-high 80 threes. “We all open things up for each other. I don't think anyone in the country can guard our posts one-on-one. If the bigs are doing a great job inside, then teams have to double and leave shooters on the outside. Seeing whgat each team is giving us and running with that,""

            Stanford led 54-23 at halftime and 70-38 after three quarters.

            Emma-Nnopu ended each of the first two quarters with a 3-pointer at the buzzer. All four of her first-half baskets were threes. She had 11 three-pointers entering the game.

            “We call her 'Green Light,” Jump said. “We all have the confidence in her to shoot that shot.”

            BIG PICTURE

            Stanford: The Cardinal recovered nicely from its upset at Washington last Sunday with a road sweep against the Arizona schools and should move up in the AP Top 25 after No. 4 UConn and No. 5 Iowa lost last week. The Cardinal has four games remaining, three against ranked teams, and finishes the regular season at No. 7 Utah on February 25.

            Arizona State: Coach Natasha Adair has had a trying first season, and a home game against Stanford is seldom a tonic. The Sun Devils were forced to forfeit mid-January games at Utah and Colorado because injuries prevented them from fielding the requisite seven scholarship players. They suited up nine players Sunday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808318,Utah beats Washington State for 7th straight Pac-12 victory,"SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Alissa Pili scored 15 points and Gianna Kneepkens had 14 points and 13 rebounds to lead No. 7 Utah to a 73-59 victory over Washington State on Sunday. 

            Jenna Johnson added 14 points and seven boards for Utah, while Daisa Young had 13 points and Kennedy McQueen chipped in 12. Utah (22-2, 12-2 Pac-12) got its seventh straight Pac-12 win. 

            The Utes shot just 36% from the field during the second half but were able to use their defense to grind out what Utah coach Lynne Roberts called “a hard-fought win,"" adding, ""we knew it would be.”











            Bella Murekatete led Washington State (16-9, 6-8) with 18 points and 14 rebounds, and Charlisse Leger-Walker added 17 points. 

            The Cougars, who shot 29% from the floor in the second half, lost their third straight to an AP Top 25 opponent.

            “I thought we guarded them pretty well,” Washington State coach Kamie Ethridge said. “I thought we did a lot of good things. We made some mistakes, but we kept the score manageable. We just didn’t score enough points.” 

            Utah’s defensive pressure gave Washington State problems throughout the first half, scoring 13 points off seven forced turnovers. Utah closed the second quarter with a 12-3 run, during which Pili and Young combined for four of five baskets. 

            The Utes had a 41-32 halftime lead, which Washington State cut to 41-36 on back-to-back layups from Murekatete and Leger-Walker early in the third quarter. 

            But the Cougars never drew closer, and the Utes eventually built a 19-point lead midway through the fourth quarter, going up 68-49 on back-to-back baskets from Kneepkens and McQueen. 

            “They were playing a little harder than us and I don’t like losing,” Kneepkens said. “I was just finding ways to get the boards and then also attacking (the rim).” 

            One big key for Utah was curtailing Washington State from cleaning up on offensive rebounds as the game progressed. The Cougars had six offensive boards in the first quarter, leading to seven second-chance points. Utah had a single offensive rebound before halftime. 

            Washington State ended up with only six more offensive boards and a single second-chance point over the final three quarters. 

            “I think I said (at halftime) if we finished the game with two offensive rebounds, we for sure were going to lose,” Roberts said. “We’re too good to just go through the motions and hope we win. And I thought we did a much better job in that second half.”

            In building a 34-11 lead in the first quarter, the Hokies made 8 of 11 3-pointers, with 3-of-4 each from Amoore and Cayla King, and they outscored Florida State 19-2 over one 5-minute stretch. The Hokies outshot FSU 63.2%-38.5%. Virginia Tech went on to lead 42-25 at halftime and 64-47 after three.

            In the fourth quarter, Florida State got no closer than the final score.











            Amoore shot 7-for-14 overall and 6-for-11 from distance to go with nine assists. King finished with 12 points on 4-of-12 3-point shooting. Taylor Soule scored 18 points and Elizabeth Kitley 11 for the Hokies (20-4, 10-4 ACC). Virginia Tech finished at 50.9% shooting overall, making 14 of 32 3-pointers (43.8%).

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808321,"No. 9 Duke tops Miami to keep ACC lead, Richardson scores 14","DURHAM, N.C. (AP) — Kara Lawson has given her Duke players a simple message all season: Defend if you want to win, defend if you want to play.

            It's why the ninth-ranked Blue Devils have risen to the top of the Atlantic Coast Conference standings.

            Reigan Richardson scored a season-high 14 points to lead the offense while Duke held Miami to 31.8% shooting in Sunday's 50-40 win — the Blue Devils' fourth straight. 











            Duke (22-3, 12-2) has focused on being a disruptive defensive team all season, entering Sunday ranked second behind only top-ranked South Carolina in scoring defense (50.7) and seventh nationally in field-goal percentage defense by holding opponents to 34.4%. 

            Two days after keeping Boston College to 27 points, Duke allowed 13 first-half points, led by 19 at halftime and then grinded through a lengthy offensive lapse late.

            “I don’t have to give grand speeches every day about how important defense is,” Lawson said. ""They know it, and they know it’s been the key to the season. And I think success helps reinforce that.”

            Richardson’s straightaway midrange jumper for a 49-34 lead with 7:27 left was Duke’s last field goal, but Duke had plenty of cushion to work with. 

            “When you're losing, sometimes you might question whether this is the way to do it,"" Lawson said. “But when you're having success, it helps you buy in even more because they love winning above all else. ... And if defense is the way to win, then they want to do it. And that's the key, finding players like that.”

            Miami (16-9, 9-5) didn’t get the deficit into single digits until the final 35 seconds and finished nearly 30 points below its scoring average in league play (69.5).

            Jasmyne Roberts scored 12 points to lead the Hurricanes, who have put themselves in contention for an NCAA Tournament bid. But Miami couldn’t get anything going early, managing more turnovers (eight) than field goals (five) with nothing coming easily in a 13-point first half.

            Miami coach Katie Meier called the first half “a lot of immaturity.”

            “Duke’s not going to let you do some stepback 1-on-1 thing and you celebrating it,” Meier said. “It can’t be about you. It’s got to be about your teammates and you’ve got to make the game easier for your teammates to beat Duke. … And we were not thinking about our teammates, so we made the game harder for our teammates.""

            BIG PICTURE

            Miami: The Hurricanes entered having won nine of 11 dating to the start of January, allowing them to dig out from a 7-6 start. Miami's 5-for-21 first-half shooting was too much to overcome and the Hurricanes finished minus-5 on the boards after outrebounding their last five opponents by an average of 12.2 per game.

            Duke: The Blue Devils have made a rapid climb under their third-year coach, who revamped the roster through the transfer portal. This win capped Duke's first week in the top 10 of the AP Top 25 since 2017.

            RICHARDSON'S PLAY

            Richardson, an in-state McDonald’s All-American who transferred from Georgia, is a regular starter but had missed 24 of 29 3-pointers on the season.

            The 5-foot-11 sophomore looked comfortable with a confident release Sunday, making 6 of 12 shots and 2 of 3 3-pointers. It was the first time she had hit multiple 3s in a game for Duke.

            “I’ve been working on it every day after practice and just getting those extra reps in really improves my confidence,” Richardson said. “They always tell me to look to shoot, and that’s what I did.”

            That included one 3 immediately after Roberts made one to bring Miami within 14 midway through the third. Richardson knocked hers down from the wing near the Duke bench.

            “I'm confident in her taking them when she's in rhythm,” Lawson said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808323,"Karlsson has goal and 2 assists, Sharks beat Capitals 4-1","WASHINGTON (AP) — Erik Karlsson had a goal and two assists, Aaron Dell stopped all eight shots he faced in relief and the San Jose Sharks ended their road trip by beating the Washington Capitals 4-1 on Sunday.

            Karlsson assisted on a goal by Evgeny Svechnikov at even strength in the first period and Alexander Barabanov on the power play in the second to give him 55 this season, good for second in the NHL. Only Tampa Bay's Nikita Kucherov has more assists.

            He scored his 18th goal of the season in the third period on a shot from along the boards that fluttered by Charlie Lindgren. A third Norris Trophy as the league's top defenseman is in reach for Karlsson, who's on pace to be the first player at that position to reach 100 points since Brian Leetch in 1991-92.











            “This is a legit Norris Trophy winner,” Sharks coach David Quinn said of Karlsson, who skated a game-high 24:07. ""There’s not a better defenseman in the league right now. I know the points get a lot attention as they should, but (it's also about) all these other things you need a defenseman to do for the most part he’s done throughout the season.”

            After a three-point performance, Karlsson is at 73 this season — his highest total in nearly a decade. The 32-year-old Swede has managed to stay healthy, playing in all 54 of San Jose's games, and could be the biggest star traded before the March 3 deadline.

            “I don’t worry about the circumstantial stuff and the things that I can’t control,” Karlsson said. ""I take care of myself, and I enjoy where I’m at and I enjoy being around the guys. I’m happy to come to the rink every day, and that’s the most important thing.”

            The Sharks are set to be sellers, with winger Timo Meier among the others who could be on the move. But after Karlsson's big game and an empty-net goal by Tomas Hertl with 2:11 left, they will happily take two wins in three games on the road since returning from the All-Star break and play eight of their next nine at home.

            “Home, where's that?” Quinn said. “It'll be very nice.”

            Dell helped ensure this victory after replacing starter Kaapo Kahkonen late in the second period. Evgeny Kuznetsov inadvertently skated into Kahkonen's head after scoring the Capitals' only goal of the game with 3:04 left in the second, and the Finnish goalie was pulled after initially saying he'd stay in.

            “They came and told me he had to do the (concussion) protocol,” said Dell, who was recalled from the minors to back up with James Reimer sick. He met the team in Washington. ”Haven’t really had time to think about it a whole lot, actually. Just been kind of go, go go. Yeah, kind of a crazy turn of events.”

            The Capitals' two-game winning streak sandwiched around the All-Star break and their bye week came to an end less than 24 hours after they beat the league-leading Bruins in Boston on Saturday.

            “It’s really disappointing,” said Lindgren, who made 29 saves and kept the Capitals in it while they were being outshot 33-21. “We played a really good game against I think the best team in the league standings-wise and we have an opportunity to come home and we didn’t get it done.”

            Washington has won the Stanley Cup more recently (2018) than they have on Super Bowl Sunday (2017). This was the Capitals' sixth consecutive loss in the traditional home matinee.

But after Karlsson's big game and an empty-net goal by Tomas Hertl with 2:11 left, they will happily take two wins in three games on the road since returning from the All-Star break and play eight of their next nine at home.“Home, where's that?” Quinn said. “It'll be very nice.”Dell helped ensure this victory after replacing starter Kaapo Kahkonen late in the second period. Evgeny Kuznetsov inadvertently skated into Kahkonen's head after scoring the Capitals' only goal of the game with 3:04 left in the second, and the Finnish goalie was pulled after initially saying he'd stay in.“They came and told me he had to do the (concussion) protocol,” said Dell, who was recalled from the minors to back up with James Reimer sick. He met the team in Washington. ”Haven’t really had time to think about it a whole lot, actually. Just been kind of go, go go. Yeah, kind of a crazy turn of events.”The Capitals' two-game winning streak sandwiched around the All-Star break and their bye week came to an end less than 24 hours after they beat the league-leading Bruins in Boston on Saturday.“It’s really disappointing,” said Lindgren, who made 29 saves and kept the Capitals in it while they were being outshot 33-21. “We played a really good game against I think the best team in the league standings-wise and we have an opportunity to come home and we didn’t get it done.”Washington has won the Stanley Cup more recently (2018) than they have on Super Bowl Sunday (2017). This was the Capitals' sixth consecutive loss in the traditional home matinee.UP NEXTSharks: Return home to face the Pittsburgh Penguins on Tuesday night.Capitals: Host the Carolina Hurricanes on Tuesday night.___Follow AP Hockey Writer Stephen Whyno on Twitter at https://twitter.com/SWhyno___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/02/13,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808324,Women's T20 WCup: India hits 42 in 3 overs to beat Pakistan,"CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — India smashed 42 runs in three overs to come through a stern test and beat fierce rival Pakistan by seven wickets at the Women's T20 World Cup on Sunday.

            Jemimah Rodrigues led India home at Newlands with 53 not out off 38 balls, and drove a four through the covers off the last delivery of the 19th over to go to her half-century and seal the victory.

            Richa Ghosh helped with 31 not out from 20 balls as India won its opening game with the help of two of its best youngsters. Rodrigues is 22 years old and Ghosh is just 19 and played at the last World Cup at the age of 16.











            The Indians needed 41 off the last four overs at a required run rate of more than 10 an over and nerves were jangling. In the end, they needed only three of the last four overs to get to 151-3 and overhaul Pakistan's 149-4.

            It gave India a vital winning start at the World Cup, where there is little room for error. The top two teams in each of the two groups go straight through to the semifinals.

            India moved second in Group 2 behind England.

            “Every match is important, no matter the opponent, but obviously Pakistan is a big game,” said India captain Harmanpreet Kaur.

            India is one of the contenders for the title. Top-ranked Australia, the defending champion, and No. 2 England won their opening games on Saturday.

            Pakistan captain Bismah Maroof led from the front for her team with 68 not out. Her unbeaten partnership of 81 for the fifth wicket with Ayesha Naseem (43 not out) ensured Pakistan set a challenging total.

            India was momentarily 109-4 when Ghosh was given out lbw for 9 when trying to sweep off the last ball of the 16th over. She reviewed the decision and replays showed the ball knicked off her glove before hitting her pad.

            She made the most of her second chance, hitting three fours in a row in the 18th over as India surged toward the target.

            Rodrigues matched that in the next over, finding the boundary three times and an unbroken stand of 58 by the two young stars took India to victory with an over to spare.

            Sri Lanka improved to two wins from two games later Sunday thanks to a match-winning partnership of 104 by Harshitha Samarawickrama and Nilakshi de Silva that dug their team out of trouble against Bangladesh.

            Bangladesh struggled to 126-8 batting first but Sri Lanka was 25-3 when seamer Marufa Akter took three wickets with her first eight deliveries without conceding a run.

            Fighting back, Samarawickrama finished 69 not out with eight fours and a six and de Silva was 41 not out to take Sri Lanka to 129-3 in 18.2 overs and to the top of Group 1.

            The partnership could have been broken 17 runs into it when an outside edge from de Silva went through the hands of Murshida Khatun as she dived forward to attempt the catch.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808325,Houthi-run court in Yemen upholds prison term against actor,"SANAA, Yemen (AP) — A court run by Yemen’s Iran-backed rebels on Sunday upheld a five-year sentence against a female actor and one of her companions who were convicted of committing an indecent act and having drugs in her possession, her lawyer said.

            The arrest of Intisar al-Hammadi and the three other women in February 2021 — as well as the court proceedings against them — have been widely criticized by international rights groups. The case has mirrored widespread Houthi repression and crackdown on women in areas they control in war-torn Yemen.

            Al-Hammadi and one of the women were first sentenced in November 2021 to five years. The other two were handed one and three years in prison, respectively.











            The Court of Appeals in the Houthi-held capital of Sanaa upheld the sentences against al-Hammadi and Yousra al-Nashri who was also handed a five-year sentence, according to lawyer Khalid al-Kamal, who represents all four women.

            Al-Hammadi, who is also a model, was born to a Yemeni father and an Ethiopian mother. She has worked as a model for four years and acted in two Yemeni soap drama series in 2020. She was the sole breadwinner for her four-member family, including her blind father and a disabled brother.

            Human Rights Watch has previously criticized the court proceedings as “marred with irregularities and abuse.” It said the Houthis confiscated al-Hammadi’s phone and “her modeling photos were treated like an act of indecency.”

            Yemen has been convulsed by civil war since 2014 when Iran-backed Houthi rebels seized the capital of Sanaa, forcing the internationally recognized government to flee to the south, then to Saudi Arabia. A Saudi-led coalition entered the war in March 2015 to try to restore the government to power.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808326,Hollywood publicist Howard Bragman dead at 66,"Howard Bragman, a beloved Hollywood publicist who specialized in crisis relations and whose clients have included Monica Lewinsky, Cameron Diaz, Ricki Lake, Sharon Osbourne and Chaz Bono, has died after a short battle with leukemia. He was 66. 

            He died Saturday night in Los Angeles, his family said Sunday. Bragman was diagnosed with leukemia just 10 days ago and promptly hospitalized. 

            A native of Flint, Michigan, where he said he always felt like a martian as a “fat, Jewish, gay kid,” Bragman got his start in public relations in Chicago, working with clients like Anheuser-Busch. Eventually he made his way to Los Angeles and founded his own firm, Bragman Nyman Cafarelli (BNC), in 1989. He became known as a go-to for helping celebrities come out publicly, including “Family Ties” star Meredith Baxter, country singer Chely Wright, basketball players John Amaechi and Sheryl Swoopes and football player Michael Sam. 











            “Howard Bragman was an industry leader who masterfully used the power of the press to create positive change and visibility for LGBTQ people,” GLAAD President and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis said in a statement. “Throughout his long career, he worked with many LGBTQ notables to ensure their coming out stories were treated with dignity and created impact for the entire community. His own visibility as an out executive, paired with a trademark humor and bold approach to public relations, made unforgettable marks.”

            Following BNC’s acquisition, he founded the firm Fifteen Minutes in 2005 and, later, LaBrea Media.

            He wrote an advice book called “Where’s My Fifteen Minutes,” weaving in amusing anecdotes of a bygone Hollywood and relating that to the celebrity, media and audience landscape of today. He advised that “all press is not good press” and whoever said so is “an idiot.” 

            In addition to being an oft-quoted expert on celebrity crises, Bragman sometimes penned articles himself too, in publications from Playboy to the Los Angeles Times, and even appeared on various reality shows, including “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” and as a guest judge on the first season of “RuPaul’s Drag Race.”

            Bragman’s influence on the industry was wide-spanning. He was an adjunct professor of public relations at the University of Southern California, developed a media training manual for young actors in Nickelodeon tv shows and films, and media trained hundreds of professionals outside of Hollywood, from elected officials and attorneys to CEOs. He was also a passionate activist for LGBTQ rights and Jewish causes.

            In 2021, he donated $1 million to establish the Howard Bragman Coming Out Fund at the University of Michigan, his alma mater, on the 50th anniversary of the school's Spectrum Center, an LGBTQ support resource.

            “I want to assure that other people get that same access that I had; life-changing, life-saving access,” he told the school’s paper at the time. “I don’t care how liberal the school is. I don’t care how accepting and loving your parents are. I don’t care how ‘woke’ the times are. Coming out is this most personal of journeys, and it’s a challenging journey.""

            Bragman is survived by his husband Mike Maimone, his brother Alan and nieces and nephews. They asked that in lieu of flowers, for mourners to consider donating to the Coming Out Fund established in his name.Howard Bragman, a beloved Hollywood publicist who specialized in crisis relations and whose clients have included Monica Lewinsky, Cameron Diaz, Ricki Lake, Sharon Osbourne and Chaz Bono, has died after a short battle with leukemia.

            Fox Sports announced Sunday during its Super Bowl pregame show that Jeter will be part of the network's studio coverage for the coming season.

            Rodriguez hugged Jeter as he came on stage and presented him with a Fox Sports baseball jersey. Jeter, who was elected to baseball’s Hall of Fame in 2020, also joins fellow Hall of Famer David Ortiz and host Kevin Burkhardt as part of the studio team.











            “I was on set at the World Series in Philadelphia and (David) Ortiz kept showing me his World Series rings. I figured I would join the team and humble him a little bit,” Jeter joked.

            Jeter and Rodriguez were teammates on the New York Yankees for 10 seasons, but their relationship wasn't close. The two were good friends early on during their big league careers, but Jeter acknowledged during his ESPN documentary series “The Captain” last year that they had grown apart after comments Rodriguez made in a 2001 interview with Esquire magazine.

            Rodriguez credited Jeter’s teammates for the Yankees' run of four World Series championships in five years from 1996-2000.

            The two, though, have seemed to put things behind them.

            Jeter — who won five championships during his 20-year career with the Yankees — said last season during Rodriguez’s ESPN show, “Sunday Night Baseball,” that the two had met to talk and clear things up.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808340,White's 23 points helps Celtics past Grizzlies 119-109,"BOSTON (AP) — Derrick White scored 23 points to help a shorthanded Boston team hold off Ja Morant and the Memphis Grizzlies 119-109 on Sunday. 

            Sam Hauser added 20 points, tying his career-high with six 3-pointers, Al Horford had 16 points and Payton Pritchard added 12 for Boston, which won its fourth straight. Celtics star Jayson Tatum didn't have his sharpest game, finishing with 16 points but making 3 of 16 shots and missing 7 of 8 on 3-point attempts.

            “That’s the beauty of this team,” said White, who also had 10 assists. “We’re just so deep. We’ve got a lot of guys that can do a little bit of everything.”











            Morant led the Grizzlies with 25 points, seven assists and six rebounds, while Desmond Bane scored 18 and Jaren Jackson Jr. had 15 points and seven rebounds. 

            Boston was without starting point guard Marcus Smart, who missed his 10th straight with a bone bruise in his right ankle, as well as forward Jaylen Brown (facial fracture he suffered from an inadvertent elbow by Tatum) and reserve guard Malcolm Brogdon (sore Achilles).

            Boston moved to 1 1/2 games ahead of the idle Bucks for the Eastern Conference's best record ahead of their matchup in Milwaukee on Tuesday.

            The Celtics were clinging to a one-point lead early in the final quarter before White scored six points — with a conventional three-point play and 3-pointer from the right wing — during a 16-7 spurt that moved them ahead 104-94 with just over four minutes to play. 

            “We have some of our top dogs out now and it's just an opportunity for guys to showcase what they can do,” Hauser said. “Try to fill that void of the guys that were out. They bring a lot to the table. We try to do our best to do whatever we can to help the team win.”

            Horford nailed three 3-pointers in the final five minutes.

            Trailing by 13 at halftime, the Grizzlies used a 13-point third quarter by Morant that featured one-handed driving baskets, flips in the lane and twisting shots to wipe out the deficit, taking the lead briefly late in the third, 

            Morant said last month that he wasn’t worried about facing any team in the West in the playoffs. He brought it up again Sunday. 

            “The confidence I had when I said that is the confidence that got us to the point where we’re at now — being one of the top teams in this league,” he said. 

            TIP-INS

            Grizzlies: Center Steven Adams missed his 10th consecutive game with a knee injury. … Morant missed his first three free-throw attempts. … They held a two-point lead after one quarter despite hitting only 2 of 9 3s while Boston was 6 of 13. They finished just 12-for-34 from beyond the arc.

            Celtics: Pritchard hit his first three shots from the floor — all 3s. “It's big, especially as a role player,” Pritchard said of his start. “When hit your first one it definitely, anybody that says it doesn't is lying to you, it definitely gives you confidence.”

            OFF WHEN AWAY 

            The Grizzlies’ road struggles continued, dropping them to 11-17 away from home.

            “How do you correct that?” coach Taylor Jenkins said before the game. “It’s got to be a mentality, for sure, obviously you trust all the work you’re putting in. … Guys have to be even more confident together on the road. We know what our standard is and that’s what it’s about and we don’t live up to that standard on the road.” 

            NICE MOMENT

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808342,"Buie, Audige help Northwestern beat No. 1 Purdue 64-58","EVANSTON, Ill. (AP) — As Northwestern struggled through the past couple seasons, Boo Buie and Chase Audige learned some tough lessons — on poise, and finishing strong, and competing.

            That's how they got to Sunday, and one historic victory for the Wildcats.

            Buie scored 26 points and Audige had 15, leading Northwestern to a 64-58 win over Zach Edey and No. 1 Purdue.











            “We put in so much work together and we've been through so many ups and downs,” Buie said. “It's finally starting to show what the real us is.” 

            Led by its experienced backcourt and supported by a rowdy student section behind each basket, Northwestern (18-7, 9-5 Big Ten) added a signature win to its bid for the school's second NCAA Tournament appearance. The Wildcats got their first win in 19 games against the No. 1 team in the AP poll.

            Northwestern's 18 wins are the most for the school since it went 24-12 during the 2016-17 season, losing to Gonzaga in the second round of the NCAA tourney. It went 32-55 in the previous three years before finding its stride against this season.

            “We had a bunch of guys that stayed the course and stayed loyal to the program and fought,” Northwestern coach Chris Collins said, ""and we had a great offseason.

            “When you have a day like this, you know it can be emotional because you know there's a lot of hard work by a lot of people to make this happen.”

            Purdue (23-3, 12-3) had won 11 in a row against Northwestern, but the Boilermakers stumbled down the stretch. They shot just 28.6% (6 for 21) and committed 13 of their 16 turnovers in the second half.

            Edey had 24 points, eight rebounds and three blocked shots, but the 7-foot-4 center turned it over six times. Freshman Braden Smith had 10 points on 1-for-7 shooting.

            “Just got to show more poise and toughness than we did,” Purdue coach Matt Painter said.

            Edey’s hook shot lifted Purdue to a 55-47 lead with 3:52 to go. But Northwestern closed the game with a 17-3 run.

            The decisive stretch began with a huge offensive rebound by Buie, setting up Audige's 3-pointer. Audige then had a fast-break dunk, and he just kept going from there.

            Audige scored 10 points in Northwestern's dazzling finish. He gave the Wildcats the lead for good when he made a 3-pointer after an Edey turnover.

            “When my team needed me, I just tried my best to be there,” Audige said. “A shot went through, and then the rim started looking a little bigger.”

            Brooks Barnhizer had a fast-break layup and Buie made two foul shots in the final minute to help Northwestern hold on. When it was over, the jubilant student sections stormed the court to celebrate with the team.

            “Hopefully that’ll give our guys confidence to know that you can compete with a team that’s as good as anybody in the country,” Collins said.

            Painter said Buie's offensive rebound was a big moment at the end.

            “We've got to secure that right there,” Painter said.

            Ethan Morton and Mason Gillis each made a 3-pointer to help Purdue open a 26-16 lead with 9:19 left in the first half. But Buie converted a driving layup in the final seconds, trimming the Boilermakers' lead to 37-30 at the break.

            WATCHING THE REFS

            Purdue attempted 12 foul shots in the first half and 12 in the second half, making 19 for the game. Northwestern attempted four free throws in the first half and 16 in the second, making a total of 14.

            Asked if he felt the game was officiated differently in the second half, Painter responded: “Yes. A lot differently, but that's basketball and that's being on the road and it's our job to adjust.”

            BIG PICTURE

            Purdue: Led by Gillis, the Boilermakers went 5 for 9 on 3-pointers in the early going. They missed their last 13 attempts from long range. They shot 36.2% from the field overall after shooting at least 50% in their previous five games. 

            Northwestern: Audige stepped up after a slow start, giving the Wildcats a big boost. Northwestern also was competitive on the glass, losing 35-30 in the rebounding battle.

(AP) — Laila Blair hit six 3-pointers and scored a career-high 30 points to help Houston edge No. 24 South Florida 71-69 on Sunday, ending a number of winning streaks for the Bulls.

            South Florida, which had won 12 straight, was 12-0 at home and was trying to go 12-0 in American Athletic Conference play for the first time.

            Houston, which never trailed after a Blair 3-pointer made it 7-5 and led by 13 in the third quarter, never flinched when Sammie Puisis hit a 3-pointer for South Florida to tie the game 58 with 7:35 to play. The Cougars never led by more than four the rest of the way.

            Oregon (14-11, 5-9 Pac-12) has lost six of its last seven games and is in the midst of its longest skid since the 2015-16 campaign — coach Kelly Graves' second season with the program.

            Endyia Rogers scored seven points in an 11-4 run, including a 3-pointer that capped the spurt, to tie the game at 55-all with three minutes to play. The Ducks missed their final five field-goal attempts from there.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808350,"No. 5 Iowa decimates Rutgers 111-57 behind Davis, Clark","IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) — Molly Davis scored a season-high 17 points, Caitlin Clark added 15 points and 10 assists, and No. 5 Iowa handily defeated Rutgers 111-57 on Sunday.

            Clark, who came into the game second in the nation in scoring and assists, picked up her 13th double-double of the season in just 21 minutes. Monika Czinano had 14 points for the Hawkeyes (20-5, 12-2 Big Ten). 

            Iowa coach Lisa Bluder went deep into her bench in the second half, with all 14 players who were on the court scoring, including Taylor McCabe's season-high 12 points and freshman Hannah Stuelke adding 10. 











            Iowa shot 62.9% from the field for the game.

            “It’s not really that we won the game, it’s how we won the game,” Bluder said. “You want to win these games to build your confidence back, certainly. But you also want to execute. You can come out here and play, be sloppy and still win, but we didn’t do that.”

            It was a program record for points in a Big Ten game for the Hawkeyes, and ranks second all-time in program history behind the 115 they scored against Evansville earlier this season.

            Iowa, which leads the nation in scoring at 87.6 points per game, topped the 100-point mark for the third time this season. 

            The Hawkeyes won for the ninth time in 10 games and moved within a game of conference leader and national No. 2 Indiana, which beat Iowa 87-78 on Thursday. 

            “We bounced back pretty well after the Indiana disappointment, and that's what you want you want from your team, right?” Bluder said.

            Rutgers was within six points with 1:22 left in the first quarter before the Hawkeyes closed the half with a 38-12 run to take a 60-28 halftime lead.

            “I think that had a lot to do with our defense,” Davis said. “We were getting stops on the defensive end and we were able to get into our transition game, and you know how good we are in transition.”

            Rutgers coach Coquese Washington put it simply after the game: “Shoot, they’re tough. They kind of did what they wanted, but the biggest thing was they got going, they got loose in transition. And they have such a dangerous team when they're in their transition game.”

            Iowa's offense kept going in the second half. The Hawkeyes made their first five shots of the third quarter, and topped the 100-point mark with 7:01 left in the game.

            McCabe, who played a season-high 17 minutes, hit three consecutive 3-pointers in the third quarter.

            “I know this is going to be important for me going forward in the learning process,” said McCabe, who has played in just 12 games this season.

            Freshman Kaylene Smikle led Rutgers (10-16, 4-10) with 28 points.

            “I know I'm biased, but she's one of the best freshmen in the conference,” Washington said. “I don't know there's another freshman that has the load she has. Other freshmen are playing well, but they're on teams with juniors and seniors ... it speaks volumes about her talent.""

            BIG PICTURE

            Rutgers: The Scarlet Knights, with just eight players on their roster, were going to have a hard time matching the Hawkeyes’ depth. Rutgers kept the game close until midway through the first half, then Iowa’s transition game wore down the Scarlet Knights.

            Iowa: The Hawkeyes needed to bounce back after Thursday’s loss to Big Ten leader Indiana, and the big first-half lead helped them do that. Clark played the longest of the starters. “Our bench tonight played really well,” Bluder said. “Just a lot of good things from this game.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808351,"Priest killed in Mexico, threats force concert to cancel","MEXICO CITY (AP) — A priest in western Mexico has been shot to death, the eighth killed under the administration of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador. 

            The church’s Catholic Multimedia Center identified the priest as Rev. Juan Angulo Fonseca. The center said Sunday that eight priests, including Angulo Fonseca, have been murdered during the current administration, which took office in December 2018. 

            Prosecutors in the western state of Jalisco said the 53-year-old parish priest was killed by two shotgun blasts in the town of Atotonilco El Alto on Friday. 











            Prosecutors said a relative fired the shots that killed the priest, and said the motive was “presumably family disputes.” The suspect fled on a motorcycle after the killing.

            “The causes, as always, are unknown,” the church center said in a statement. “Some hypotheses point to conflicts over land titles. But the parishioners of Our Lady of Guadalupe parish in Guadalupe Valley were indignant over the killing of a priest who they respected for his pastoral work.”

            The church’s Catholic Multimedia Center said at least two dozen priests were killed under former president Enrique Peña Nieto, who served from 2012 to 2018.

            Meanwhile, in the northern Mexico border city of Tijuana violent threats forced the cancellation of a planned concert by the norteño band Grupo Arriesgado.

            The band is from Sinaloa and is known for singing “narco corridos” or “war corridos” about drug traffickers.

            In a statement, the band wrote “due to the events of the last few days and in accordance with the wishes of the authorities, a decision has been made to cancel the show,” which was to be held Saturday night.

            The band did not specifically refer to violence or threats, but wrote “at Grupo Arriesgado and GA Music, the safety of our fans is our first priority.”

            A hand-lettered sign hung on an overpass prior to the concert warned the band's lead singer that he was not welcome in Tijuana. The message was signed “CJNG,” the initials of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, which has been disputing turf with the Sinaloa cartel.

            And local media posted video of an autograph session held by members of the group at a shopping center prior to the concert, in which gunshots can be heard.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808353,Protesters stage huge rally in Madrid for better healthcare,"Health workers and their supporters rallied in central Madrid on Sunday, accusing the right-wing regional government of trying to destroy the public health system in the Spanish capital.More than 250,000 people took part in the demonstration, the government said, while organizers put the turnout at close to a million.Demonstrators filled the downtown Plaza Cibeles area, chanting and waving flags. Many carried homemade signs with messages like ""The right to health is a human right. Defend the health service.""One demonstrator sported a huge model of Isabel Diaz Ayuso, the right-wing leader of the Madrid regional government, with a Pinocchio-like nose attached.""In Spain, the public health system used to be very good,"" Madrid resident Ana Santamaria told the AFP news agency. ""But in recent years it has really deteriorated, particularly since the pandemic.""Unions and left-wing parties complain about long patient waiting lists and a shortage of staff in health centers, forcing patients to overwhelm hospital emergency departments. Many government critics believe the conservatives are dismantling the system.""The situation is dramatic... We can't take proper care of the patients,"" nurse Maite Lopez told AFP.Diaz Ayuso's opponents say her administration spends the least amount per capita on primary health care of any Spanish region even though it has the highest per capita income.For every €2 spent on health care in Madrid, one ends up in the private sector, according to protest organizers.Ayuso denies the accusation and wrote on Twitter on Sunday: ""We all believe in public health.""She alleges the protests are motivated by the political interests of left-wing rivals ahead of May regional elections across most of Spain.Spain has a hybrid healthcare system but the public sector is larger than the private one and is considered a basic pillar of the state.The governments of the regional autonomous communities are responsible for a large part of the health budget as part of the country's devolved political system.The protest movement against health-care cuts has gathered strength through regular protests in recent months.Another protest Sunday in Santiago de Compostela, in northwestern Spain, saw some 20,000 health workers take part.Some doctors and pediatricians have been striking on and off since November, with the Amyts doctors' union in Madrid seeking better working conditions and pay.mm/dj (AFP, AP, Reuters)",2023/02/12,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808354,Hamlin makes appearance on field at Super Bowl,"GLENDALE, Ariz. (AP) — Damar Hamlin has made it to the Super Bowl.

            The Buffalo Bills safety made his third appearance in Phoenix during Super Bowl week, this time on the field at State Farm Stadium prior to Sunday's game between the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles.

            It’s been a little more than a month since Hamlin went into cardiac arrest and needed to be resuscitated on the field in Cincinnati. Sunday’s appearance was another milestone in his remarkable recovery.











            “I’m allowing that to be in God’s hands,” Hamlin said in an interview with Fox’s Michael Strahan. “I’m just thankful he gave me a second chance.”

            During the pregame pageantry, the NFL honored the Bills and Cincinnati Bengals training and medical staffs, along with the staff at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center. A minute later, Hamlin joined them, putting his hands together to form a heart. He also received hugs from several of the first responders.

            
                He also appeared on stage at “NFL Honors” on Thursday night.
              

            “My entire life, I felt like God was using me to give others hope and now with a new set of circumstances, I can say he’s doing what he’s always done,” Hamlin said Thursday. “I have a long journey ahead, a journey full of unknowns and a journey full of milestones, but it’s a lot easier to face your fears when you know your purpose.”

            Hamlin collapsed on the field after a collision with Bengals wide receiver Tee Higgins on Jan. 2. The sight of an elite-level athlete nearly dying on the field sent a shock across the NFL and the world.

Sunday’s appearance was another milestone in his remarkable recovery.“I’m allowing that to be in God’s hands,” Hamlin said in an interview with Fox’s Michael Strahan. “I’m just thankful he gave me a second chance.”During the pregame pageantry, the NFL honored the Bills and Cincinnati Bengals training and medical staffs, along with the staff at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center. A minute later, Hamlin joined them, putting his hands together to form a heart. He also received hugs from several of the first responders.He also appeared on stage at “NFL Honors” on Thursday night.“My entire life, I felt like God was using me to give others hope and now with a new set of circumstances, I can say he’s doing what he’s always done,” Hamlin said Thursday. “I have a long journey ahead, a journey full of unknowns and a journey full of milestones, but it’s a lot easier to face your fears when you know your purpose.”Hamlin collapsed on the field after a collision with Bengals wide receiver Tee Higgins on Jan. 2. The sight of an elite-level athlete nearly dying on the field sent a shock across the NFL and the world.___AP Sports Writer John Marshall contributed to this report.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/02/13,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808358,"Golden Knights score 5 goals in 3rd period, beat Ducks 7-2","LAS VEGAS (AP) — Vegas stumbled into the All-Star break with one victory in eight games, but since then, the Golden Knights are on fire with three blowout wins in a row.

            The latest occurred Sunday with a 7-2 victory over the Anaheim Ducks in which seven Vegas players had two points. The Knights scored five times in the third period to break open a one-goal game.

            Michael Amadio, William Carrier, Jack Eichel, Phil Kessel and Shea Theodore each had a goal and an assist. Paul Cotter and Brett Howden added a goal each for Vegas. Reilly Smith and William Karlsson each had two assists.











            Isac Lundestrom had a goal and an assist, and Frank Vatrano also scored for the Ducks. John Gibson finished with 32 saves.

            After heading into the All-Star break at 1-5-2, the Knights have outscored their last three opponents by a combined 17-4 to take a three-point lead in the Pacific Division.

            “I think you’re kind of limping into the break a little bit,” Knights coach Bruce Cassidy said. “Everyone knows it’s coming. You’re on the road and things aren't happening for you, so mentally you’re a little bit challenged. Coming out of the break, you're refreshed. That mental sort of weight is gone. You're starting over. The history of scoring in our room is there, so we knew it wasn't going to go on forever.""

            The Knights outshot Anaheim 12-5 in the first period and dominated play nearly throughout. But they held just a 1-0 lead on Paul Cotter's rebound goal 2:08 into the game.

            The teams traded goals in the second period — Howden scoring for the Knights and Vatrano for the Ducks.

            Anaheim nearly tied the game early in the third period, but Ryan Strome was stuffed on a breakaway by Knights goalie Adin Hill. With Logan Thompson week to week with a lower-body injury, Hill is Vegas’ starter for the near term, and he made 23 saves.

            “I was just trying to be patient and wait for him to make the first move,” Hill said of Strome's shot attempt. “I think he was trying to kind of go above the pad there and kind of whiffed on it a bit. But it hit my pad and stayed out.”

            Then the Knights took over.

            Theodore scored at 6:40, Kessel at 8:11 and Eichel at 11:53 to make it 5-1.

            Those goals not only helped ensure the Knights would continue their sudden hot play, but also handed the Ducks their second loss in a row after their best stretch of the season. They had gone 4-0-1 before losing to Pittsburgh on Friday and then Vegas.

            “I think the missed breakaway that would've evened it up would've certainly helped,” Ducks coach Dallas Eakins said. “Vegas got a couple of hard-working, good-bounce goals, and then we just fell apart trying to do everybody else's job in our own zone.""

            Anaheim added a goal when Lundestrom scored at 13:34. He also had the primary assist on the other Ducks goal.

            Then Amadio and Carrier answered for Vegas.

            NOTES

            Anaheim defenseman John Klingberg (seven goals, 13 assists) did not play because of an illness and was replaced by Colton White. Klingberg had a goal and two assists in his previous two games. ... Howden has points in consecutive games for the first time since a five-game streak Jan. 24, 2022-Feb. 8, 2022. ...

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808360,"VanVleet tops 30 for 9th time, Raptors beat Pistons 119-118","TORONTO (AP) — Fred VanVleet scored 35 points, topping 30 for a career-best ninth time this season, and Pascal Siakam added 28 points as the Toronto Raptors beat the Detroit Pistons 119-118 Sunday for their fourth win in five games.

            Scottie Barnes scored 20 points and Precious Achiuwa had 11 points and 11 rebounds as Toronto won its second straight win over Detroit after losing the previous six meetings.

            VanVleet and the Raptors bounced back after blowing a 12-point lead in the final five minutes of Friday’s home loss to Utah.











            “That hurt,” VanVleet. “Everyone was frustrated for sure, but the game goes on. We’ve got to stay focussed on the games in front of us and pile them up as best as we can.”

            Toronto is 20-7 all-time when VanVleet scores 30 or more points. Siakam has scored 25 or more in three straight games.

            “It’s certainly a treat to have two guys out there who you can coach the team through,” said Toronto assistant coach Adrian Griffin, who led the Raptors Sunday with head coach Nick Nurse away for personal reasons.

            Detroit’s Dwane Casey worked with both Siakam and VanVleet when he was head coach in Toronto.

            “They were the difference in the game,” Casey said of Toronto’s duo. “They carried the team, they did a great job.”

            Bojan Bogdanovic scored 33 points, Alec Burks had 21, and Hamidou Diallo and Jaden Ivey each had 18 for the Pistons. Detroit failed once again to win consecutive games for the second time this season.

            Detroit beat San Antonio in double overtime Friday in a matchup of two of the NBA’s worst teams. The Pistons haven’t won back-to-back games since victories at Denver and Utah on Nov. 22 and 23, following all 10 wins since with defeats.

            Ivey’s 3-pointer with 10.1 seconds left in the fourth quarter cut it to 116-113 before VanVleet answered with a pair of free throws.

            Bogdanovic hit two free throws, but Achiuwa made one of two at the line to put Toronto up by four points with 4.4 seconds left. Ivey’s 3 at the buzzer wasn’t enough for Detroit.

            Pistons center Jalen Duren injured his right ankle in the second quarter, but returned to start the second half. The rookie teenager scored a career-high 30 points Friday. The 19-year-old Duren finished with six points in 21 minutes.

            “He turned it pretty good,” Casey said. “Just trying to go up and down the floor and when they were attacking the rim, he just couldn’t pivot and move. Hopefully it’s not something that’s long lasting.”

            Toronto scored 14 points off 18 Detroit turnovers. The Raptors allowed a season-low five points off their eight turnovers.

            “We’ve just got to be smarter with the ball, stronger with the ball,” Casey said. “A lot of our turnovers were self-inflicted, throwing it to nobody, throwing it to air.”

            Raptors center Jakob Poeltl started for the first time in two games since rejoining the team that drafted him. He took the spot of guard Gary Trent Jr., who sat because of a sore left calf.

            Toronto held a 53-52 edge at halftime and took an 85-77 lead to the fourth.

            HAYES STRUGGLES AGAIN

            Detroit’s Killian Hayes shot 1 for 10 and scored two points. He shot 1 for 11 Friday.

            “He’s pressing a little bit,” Casey said. “I told him ‘Relax, have fun, play basketball.’ He’s overthinking things with his shooting.”

            James van Riemsdyk, Owen Tippett and Patrick Brown scored for the Flyers. Philadelphia completed a homestand with its third loss in four games.











            The pregame had a party atmosphere as the appetizer for Sunday night’s Super Bowl featuring the Philadelphia Eagles versus the Kansas City Chiefs. Flyers players entered the arena wearing Eagles jerseys, matching many fans’ choice of Eagles apparel. Defensemen Travis Sanheim and Tony DeAngelo sported Eagles winter caps during warmups, and Eagles legend Vince Papale pounded the drum before the opening faceoff.

            CANADIENS 6, OILERS 2

            MONTREAL (AP) — Jordan Harris had his first career two-goal game and Montreal earned wins on back-to-back afternoons.

            Alex Belzile, Josh Anderson, Rafael Harvey-Pinard and Christian Dvorak added goals for Montreal. Evgenii Dadonov and Jonathan Drouin each recorded two assists. Jake Allen made 30 saves.

            Leon Draisaitl and Evander Kane scored for Edmonton. Connor McDavid was left off the score sheet, ending a 15-game point streak.

            Stuart Skinner made 24 saves as the Oilers recorded their first regulation loss in 12 games. They were on a 9-0-2 run heading into Sunday’s contest.

            GOLDEN KNIGHTS 7, DUCKS 2

            LAS VEGAS (AP) — Seven Vegas players had two points and the Golden Knight scored five times in the third period to break open a one-goal game and extend their winning streak to three games.

            Michael Amadio, William Carrier, Jack Eichel, Phil Kessel and Shea Theodore each had a goal and an assist. Paul Cotter and Brett Howden added goal for Vegas. Reilly Smith and William Karlsson each had two assists.

            Isac Lundestrom had a goal and an assist, and Frank Vatrano also scored for the Ducks. John Gibson finished with 32 saves.

            After stumbling into the All-Star break at 1-5-2, the Knights have come out firing since then. They have outscored their last three opponents by a combined 17-4 to take a three-point lead in the Pacific Division.

            SHARKS 4, CAPITALS 1

            WASHINGTON (AP) — Erik Karlsson had a goal and two assists, Aaron Dell stopped all eight shots he faced in relief and San Jose ended its road trip by beating Washington.

            Karlsson assisted on a goal by Evgeny Svechnikov at even strength in the first period and Alexander Barabanov on the power play in the second to give him 55 this season, good for second in the NHL. Tomas Hertl added an empty-net goal with 2:11 left

            Karlsson scored his 18th goal of the season in the third period on a shot from along the boards that fluttered by Charlie Lindgren. A third Norris Trophy as the league’s top defenseman is in reach for Karlsson, who’s on pace to be the first player at that position to reach 100 points since Brian Leetch in 1991-92.

            Evgeny Kuznetsov scored Washington’s only goal and Lindgren made 29 saves.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808363,Report: Companies' climate targets not what they claim to be,"BERLIN (AP) — Climate commitments by companies aren’t always as green as they seem. A new report concludes major brands are exaggerating how ambitious their efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions are — in effect misleading consumers, investors and governments.

            The report published Monday by the Europe-based environmental think tanks NewClimate Institute and Carbon Market Watch examined 24 companies, including KitKat manufacturer Nestle, French retailer Carrefour and automaker Volkswagen. It found that only one company — shipping firm Maersk — had climate plans with “reasonable integrity” while the rest were assessed to be moderate to very low.

            “For the majority of companies, we found their climate strategies to be lacking,” said Thomas Day, a researcher at the NewClimate Institute who co-authored the report.











            Actual emissions cuts resulting from the companies’ plans would amount to less than half those needed by 2030 to help meet the Paris climate accord’s goal of capping global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit), it found in its second annual assessment.

            The researchers also questioned companies' pledges to achieve ""net zero’' emissions, arguing that most consumers would understand that to mean largely stopping the release of planet-heating gas into the atmosphere.

            ""These net zero pledges, they actually amount to a commitment to reduce the emissions of those companies by just 36%,” said Day. Companies either claim the rest will be removed from the atmosphere by artificial or natural means — so-called carbon offsets — or simply remove large chunks of their emissions from the tally.

            This was the case, for example, for Carrefour, which excludes 80% of its stores from the net zero target for 2040, according to the report. The company was among four corporations ranked as having climate plans with “very low integrity,” along with American Airlines, food processing company JBS and Samsung Electronics.

            Carrefour said it disagreed with the report, adding that its climate efforts had been validated by independent experts — a position also taken by Swiss-based Nestle, whose targets were labeled as having “low integrity.""

            “We will continue to pursue a holistic strategy of reducing our emissions and removing carbon from the atmosphere through measures that deliver benefits to the millions of people connected to our company’s operations,” Nestle said in a statement.

            Volkswagen, whose targets were also assessed as having “low integrity,” said it was committed to meeting the goal of the Paris accord, noting that it plans to invest €52 billion ($55.5 billion) in electric vehicles by 2026.

            “We support the NewClimate Institute’s concern to achieve the greatest possible transparency and comparability in the climate goals of large companies,” it said.

            The report's authors said their findings highlighted the need for greater transparency and stricter regulation of corporate climate efforts, to prevent companies from greenwashing their environmental impact —- particularly when making ‘net zero’ claims.

            “In many ways, carbon-neutral products are similar to cancer-neutral cigarettes,” said co-author Gilles Dufrasne of Carbon Market Watch. “There is no robust scientific basis behind those claims, and most consumers are just completely confused about what those claims would mean.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808372,"Wu Yibing tops Isner, is 1st from China with ATP Tour title","DALLAS (AP) — Wu Yibing became the first Chinese player to win an ATP Tour title, rallying in a three-set, all-tiebreaker thriller to beat John Isner in the Dallas Open on Sunday.

            Wu overcame 44 aces from the big-serving Isner — one shy of tying a three-set record — and four match points in the 6-7 (4), 7-6 (3), 7-6 (12) victory. The 23-year-old was the first Chinese player in an ATP final.

            Wu also came back from a set down to beat top-seeded American Taylor Fritz in the semifinals. There were no service breaks in Wu's victory over the fifth-seeded Isner, who was playing in his hometown tournament.











            “It's not only about winning the title, I think it's more about me personally making history and also for the country,” said Wu, who was the first Chinese man to reach the third round of the U.S. Open when he did it as a qualifier last year. 

            “That's huge for the next generation,” Wu said. “For me, I need to keep going, keep my body healthy. I'm sure there's more to come.”

            Leading 8-7 in the third-set tiebreaker, Isner came to the net for an easy volley that hit the top of the net and stayed on Isner's side. The 6-foot-10 American sensed the opportunity lost, sitting for a few moments and fiddling with the strings on his racket.

            Wu saved another match point at 10-9 and had four match points of his own in the final tiebreaker before finally converting on Isner's serve when Isner sent a forehand long off Wu's return. 

            Wu fell on his back in disbelief, staying down long enough for Isner to come across the net to congratulate him. 

            It was the first tiebreaker in a decisive set in Wu’s career, who climbed into the top 60 of the rankings for the first time. 

            Battling injuries that kept him out for most of 2019-20 before the pandemic sidelined him even longer, Wu was No. 1,121 a year ago.

            “I've been through a lot of things,” Wu said. “I think the reason now I'm relaxed on tennis courts is I trust myself. If you want to beat me, you have to work hard.”

            Since his return, Wu has a 50-10 match record and had won three ATP Challenger titles before his Dallas breakthrough. 

            Isner was trying for his 17th career title in his 31st final. He made the semifinals in the inaugural Dallas Open last year before losing to eventual champion Reilly Opelka in the semifinals.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808373,Scheffler repeats at Phoenix Open to regain No. 1 ranking,"SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) — Scottie Scheffler successfully defended his WM Phoenix Open title Sunday at TPC Scottsdale to regain the No. 1 spot in the world.

            Scheffler closed with a 6-under 65 to beat Nick Taylor by two strokes in breezy conditions on the firm and fast Stadium Course. The 26-year-old Texan will jump from second to first in the rankings, taking the top spot from Rory McIlroy with his fifth PGA Tour victory.

            Scheffler made a 22-foot eagle putt on the par-5 13th to break a tie with Taylor, then took a two-shot lead on the par-3 16th with a 15-footer for par after hitting his tee shot far left on the stadium hole.











            “I was just trying to hit a solid putt,” Scheffler said about the putt on 16. “In those situations that’s really all you can do. So, when I’m standing over that ball all I’m thinking about is the speed. I had my line.”

            Scheffler birdied the short par-4 17th and closed with a par to finish at 19-under 265.

            “I hit some wild shots off the tee that were pretty uncharacteristic for how I usually shape the ball,” Scheffler said. “I was just able to grind it out, make a lot of putts. I think I only had two bogeys this week, which is really, really good around this golf course.”

            He earned $3.6 million from the $20 million purse in the second of the PGA Tour’s new designated events, created in response to LIV Golf to bring the top tour players together more often.

            “There were a lot of guys up there,” Scheffler said. “I knew it was going to take a great round. Nobody was going to give this golf tournament to me. I had to go out and earn it.”

            Last year, Scheffler beat Patrick Cantlay in a playoff for his first tour title. He added victories in the Arnold Palmer Invitational, the WGC-Match Play and the Masters and was the PGA Tour’s player of the year.

            “I love the environment here,” Scheffler said. “It’s a lot of fun to play. I think the firmness of the golf course really suits me. Having the ability to play a lot of different shots — hit it high, hit it low.”

            He's the seventh player to successfully defend a title in the tournament, following Ben Hogan (1946-47), Jimmy Demaret (1949-50), Lloyd Mangrum (1952-53), Arnold Palmer (three straight from 1961-63), Johnny Miller (1974-75) and Hideki Matsuyama (2016-17).

            Taylor also finished with a 65. The Canadian bogeyed the 16th, missing a 7-footer after Scheffler holed his par putt. Taylor’s tee shot on the 175-yard 16th just caught the left edge and rolled away from the green.

            “I really felt that was a great swing off the tee there,” Taylor said. “That wind was just crazy strong. I played enough for it, just obviously not quite enough. I would love the chip back on there. I felt like that was one I could potentially hole. It was still a tricky chip.”

            Jon Rahm, the former Arizona State star who opened the year with consecutive victories in Hawaii and the California desert, was third at 14 under after a 68. He also was in position to take the No. 1 spot with a victory.

            “I’m not sure I could have done much better the last two days, honestly,” Rahm said. “I didn’t feel like I made bad swings, but I put myself in bad spots.”

            The wind was a factor all week, with the large grandstands and spectator mounds making it difficult to judge.

            “The wind this week brought a new challenge that we hadn’t had around this golf course since I’ve been playing this tournament,” Scheffler said. “So, it was definitely a good challenge and was a fun week.”

            Justin Thomas was fourth at 13 under after a 65. Jason Day (68) followed at 12 under, and Jordan Speith (70) was another stroke back with Sam Burns (68), Sungjae Im (69) and Tyrrell Hatton (69).

            Rickie Fowler was in the group at 10 under. The 2019 winner had a hole-in-one on the par-3 seventh, using a 6-iron in the 216-yard hole.

            McIlroy closed with a 70 to tie for 32nd at 4 under.

            AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsSCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) — Scottie Scheffler successfully defended his WM Phoenix Open title Sunday at TPC Scottsdale to regain the No. 1 spot in the world.Scheffler closed with a 6-under 65 to beat Nick Taylor by two strokes in breezy conditions on the firm and fast Stadium Course. The 26-year-old Texan will jump from second to first in the rankings, taking the top spot from Rory McIlroy with his fifth PGA Tour victory.Scheffler made a 22-foot eagle putt on the par-5 13th to break a tie with Taylor, then took a two-shot lead on the par-3 16th with a 15-footer for par after hitting his tee shot far left on the stadium hole.“I was just trying to hit a solid putt,” Scheffler said about the putt on 16. “In those situations that’s really all you can do. So, when I’m standing over that ball all I’m thinking about is the speed. I had my line.”Scheffler birdied the short par-4 17th and closed with a par to finish at 19-under 265.“I hit some wild shots off the tee that were pretty uncharacteristic for how I usually shape the ball,” Scheffler said. “I was just able to grind it out, make a lot of putts. I think I only had two bogeys this week, which is really, really good around this golf course.”He earned $3.6 million from the $20 million purse in the second of the PGA Tour’s new designated events, created in response to LIV Golf to bring the top tour players together more often.“There were a lot of guys up there,” Scheffler said. “I knew it was going to take a great round. Nobody was going to give this golf tournament to me. I had to go out and earn it.”Last year, Scheffler beat Patrick Cantlay in a playoff for his first tour title. He added victories in the Arnold Palmer Invitational, the WGC-Match Play and the Masters and was the PGA Tour’s player of the year.“I love the environment here,” Scheffler said. “It’s a lot of fun to play. I think the firmness of the golf course really suits me. Having the ability to play a lot of different shots — hit it high, hit it low.”He's the seventh player to successfully defend a title in the tournament, following Ben Hogan (1946-47), Jimmy Demaret (1949-50), Lloyd Mangrum (1952-53), Arnold Palmer (three straight from 1961-63), Johnny Miller (1974-75) and Hideki Matsuyama (2016-17).Taylor also finished with a 65.

            Maddy Westbeld added 14 points while Olivia Miles had 13 points, seven rebounds and seven assists for the Irish (20-4, 11-3 ACC).

            Sonia Citron’s 3-pointer at 7:13 of the fourth quarter put Notre Dame ahead 62-60 and the Irish did not relinquish the lead the rest of the way.











            The last advantage for the Orange was at 60-59 on a basket by Georgia Woolley at 7:33 of the fourth quarter.

            Dyaisha Fair scored 22 points to lead Syracuse (16-10, 7-8). Woolley added 17 points and Dariauna Lewis 14 to go with 10 rebounds.

            Syracuse trailed 36-24 at halftime, but led 54-52 going into the fourth quarter.

            Notre Dame gave up just 10 points in the fourth quarter after yielding 30 in the third period.

            “I was really pleased with our defensive intensity in the fourth quarter,” Irish coach Niele Ivey said. “I’m always preaching in the fourth quarter of finishing out 10 minutes and having that mindset defensively.”

            The Orange connected on 12-of-17 floor shots during the third period and the Irish made 5-of-14.

            “I made a change and put a rookie out there who really understood the assignment and that we need to attack the glass,” Syracuse coach Felicia Legette-Jack said of her decision to put freshman Kennedi Perkins on the floor. “We started attacking and playing basketball.

            “It was such a gap and we had to fight so far to come back that we lost our footing again.”

            Notre Dame ended the second quarter on a 15-2 run.

            The Irish secured the program’s second straight 20-win season and the 17th in the past 20.

            NEW LOOK

            With Dara Mabrey out for the rest of the season and Lauren Ebo missing several recent games, the Irish have had to adjust.

            “With this lineup and new team we have we’re still trying to figure each other out and our chemistry,” said Ivey. “I’m really proud of how we held our composure and stayed poised within the run (by Syracuse).

            “Offensively, they’re learning how to play as a unit.”

            TALL TASK

            Legette-Jack addressed the challenge that faced her squad against Notre Dame.

            “They’re long and you know they probably have five All-Americans,” Legette-Jack said. “They have a high IQ for the game.”

            BIRTHDAY GIRL

            Watson, a 6-foot-4 junior forward, celebrated her birthday with an Irish victory.

            “She was fantastic from the beginning with her energy, defense, scoring the ball and some huge free throws,” Ivey said. “She ignited us today.”

            BIG PICTURE

            Notre Dame: With four games left in the regular season, the Irish are one game behind Duke in the conference. The Blue Devils (22-3, 12-2) beat Miami 50-40 on Sunday.

            Syracuse: The Orange slipped to 3-7 in road games.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808389,De La Soul co-founder Trugoy the Dove dead at 54,"David Jude Jolicoeur, known widely as Trugoy the Dove and one of the founding members of the Long Island hip-hop trio De La Soul, has died. He was 54.

            His representative Tony Ferguson confirmed the reports Sunday. No other information was immediately available.

            In recent years, Jolicoeur, had said he was battling congestive heart failure and wore a LifeVest defibrillator machine. De La Soul was part of the hip-hop tribute at the Grammy Awards last week, but Trugoy was not onstage with his fellow bandmates. 











            Tributes poured in on social media shortly after the news broke Sunday. 

            “Dave! It was a honor to share so many stages with you,” wrote rapper Big Daddy Kane on Instagram. 

            Rapper Erick Sermon posted on Instagram that “This one hurts. From Long Island from one of the best rap groups in Hiphop # Delasoul #plug2 Dave has passed away you will be missed… RIP.”

            Young Guru added, “Rest in peace my brother. You were loved. @plugwondelasoul I love you brother we are here for you. Smiles I love you bro. This is crazy” and DJ Semtex wrote that it was “heart wrenching news.” 

            “Luke Cage” showrunner and hip-hop journalist Cheo Hodari Coker wrote on Twitter that, ""You don’t understand what De La Soul means to me. Their existence said to me, a black geek from Connecticut that yes, hip-hop belongs to you too, and Trugoy was the balance, McCartney to Pos Lennon, Keith to his Mick. This is a huge loss.”

            Jolicoeur was born in Brooklyn but raised in the Amityville area of Long Island, where he met Vincent Mason (Pasemaster Mase) and Kelvin Mercer (Posdnuos) and the three decided to form a rap group, with each taking on distinctive names. Trugoy, Jolicoeur said, was backwards for “yogurt.” More recently he’d been going by Dave.

            De La Soul’s debut studio album “3 Feet High and Rising,” produced by Prince Paul, was released in 1989 by Tommy Boy Records and praised for being a more light-hearted and positive counterpart to more charged rap offerings like N.W.A’s “Straight Outta Compton” and Public Enemy’s “It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back” released just one year prior. 

            Sampling everyone from Johnny Cash and Steely Dan to Hall & Oates, De La Soul signaled the beginning of alternative hip-hop. In Rolling Stone, critic Michael Azerrad called it the first “psychedelic hip-hop record.” Some even called them a hippie group, though the members didn’t quite like that. 

            In 2010, “3 Feet High and Rising” was added to the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress for its historic significance. 

            “It’s a hip-hop masterpiece for the era in which it was released,” Jolicoeur told Billboard earlier this year. “I think the element of that time of what was taking place in music, hip-hop, and our culture, I think it welcomed that and opened up minds and spirits to see and try new different things. ... I think the innocence that we had back then was brave, but we were in a time where innocence was so cool. Not sampling James Brown, but sampling Liberace; I think it was shocking (when) we came out (that) we sampled Liberace. I don’t know if it’d impact the same way (now).”

            They followed with “De La Soul Is Dead,” in 1991, which was a bit darker and more divisive with critics, and “Buhloone Mindstate"" and “Stakes is High,” in 1993 and 1996 respectively.

            De La Soul released eight albums overall and in March were going to make their streaming service debut, on Spotify, Apple Music and others after a long battle with Tommy Boy Records about legal and publishing matters. The 2021 acquisition of Tommy Boy Records by Reservoir, with masters from the likes of De La Soul, Queen Latifah and Naughty By Nature, helped move things along and the full catalog was set to debut on March 3. 

            ""You think that you own your stuff and that now it’s on cruise control, waiting for the checks to come in. But it is not that way at all. There’s a lot to do,” Jolicoeur told Billboard. “You do need collaborators, you do need help, you do need to rework back into the system and not necessarily be the lone commissioner of this project. You need allies, you need companies to work with, you need people to hire, and we learned a big lesson from that. It definitely wasn’t just, “We got our masters back!” It ain’t that.”

            Over the years, the group was nominated for six Grammy Awards, winning one for Best Pop Vocal Collaboration for the Gorillaz song “Feel Good Inc.” 

            During the pandemic, he said, there were talks of solo albums and branching out — which weren't new. 

            “We support each other in those ideas, but at the same time, I think the magic really happens when it’s the three of us,” he said. “I’m not trying to crack that formula, and I don’t think anyone else is, either.”

            Asked what advice he would give to groups about how to stay together, he said you have to fight, but remember you’re fighting for the team. 

            “Sometimes it’s about money, but then there’s an element of: We don’t get along because we haven’t been honest with each other. Get through that honesty, move on, and keep going — because it feels good going. Fight it out, get it all out, and come back knowing that you’re fighting for the team,” he said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808390,"New Mex St cancels season after sex, harassment allegations","New Mexico State's men's basketball season came to an abrupt halt Sunday after the release of a police report that detailed three players ganging up on a teammate and attacking him in a case that includes allegations of false imprisonment, harassment and criminal sexual contact.

            “It's time for this program to reset,” chancellor Dan Arvizu said in the statement that announced the end of the season. 

            Arvizu said the shutdown was in response to a report filed to campus police on Friday by a player against three teammates. According to the report, the victim said that on Feb. 6, his teammates held him down “removed his clothing exposing his buttocks and began to slap his (buttocks). He also went on to state that they also touched his scrotum.”











            The victim, whose name was redacted in the report along with those of the other players, said other incidents involving inappropriate physical and sexual touching had been occurring in locker rooms and on road trips since last summer. Regarding the latest instance, the victim told police he had no choice but to let this happen “because it's a 3-on-1 type of situation.”

            Arvizu, who will be leaving the university in June after regents recently chose not to renew his contract, said “this action is clearly needed, especially after receiving additional facts and reviewing investigation reports related to the hazing allegations involving student-athletes on the team.”

            “We must uphold the safety of our students and the integrity of our university,” said Arvizu, who had initially suspended the program on Friday, then revealed what he called hazing allegations a day later. 

            He said he had spoken with the commissioner of the Western Athletic Conference, which said it was reviewing how to treat the six New Mexico State games that will be wiped off the schedule in regards to seeding for next month’s conference tournament. 

            The report said the victim went to campus police to report a possible assault, but did not want to press criminal charges for the time being. 

            The allegations come less than three months after the suspension of forward Mike Peake, who is being investigated in the case of the fatal shooting of a student from rival school, University of New Mexico, in Albuquerque on Nov. 19.

            Peake has not been charged in that case, which included state police stopping the team bus on Interstate-25 as it headed back to Las Cruces shortly after the shooting. Missing from the bus were Peake and three of his teammates, who had taken him to the hospital with an injured leg.

            New Mexico State finished the season at 9-15, with only two conference wins in 12 games. The Aggies, long a source of pride on their 13,000-student campus in Las Cruces, have been to eight NCAA tournaments since 2007. They are scheduled to move from the WAC to Conference-USA next season. 

            The next big decision for this program appears to be coming Tuesday, when university regents will hold a closed meeting to discuss “limited personnel matters concerning individual employees.” It did not name the employees who were to be discussed. The scheduling of the meeting came Saturday, the day after Arvizu placed coach Greg Heiar and his staff on administrative leave at the same time he suspended the season. 

            The scrubbing of the 2022-23 campaign came a day after two players quit following the initial reports of the hazing incident.

            One of them, redshirt freshman Shahar Lazar, said he was leaving because “I don’t think the program that I originally committed to aligns with my beliefs and core values.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808392,MATCHDAY: Merseyside derby is next test for Dyche's Everton,"A look at what’s happening in European soccer on Monday:

            ENGLAND

            Liverpool and Everton go head-to-head in the Merseyside derby with both teams desperate for Premier League points. Jurgen Klopp’s slim hopes of a top four, Champions League qualifying spot for Liverpool are diminishing as his team continues to falter. Everton, lifted by the hiring of Sean Dyche and victory against leader Arsenal in his first game in charge, faces a fight for Premier League survival. A win for Everton would see it climb out of the relegation zone, while Liverpool can move up to ninth, above Chelsea. 











            ITALY

            Inter Milan will be looking to cement second spot in Serie A when it visits Sampdoria, which needs the points to inch closer to safety. Inter is two points ahead of Atalanta, Roma and AC Milan in a tight fight for Champions League spots. The Nerazzurri will be hoping forward Lautaro Martínez can maintain his stellar form. The World Cup winner has scored seven goals in his last eight matches, including the only goal in the derby victory over Milan last weekend. Sampdoria has lost five of its last six matches and is second from last in the standings. Fellow struggler Hellas Verona has given itself hope of avoiding the drop after only losing one of its past six matches. It hosts Salernitana.

            SPAIN

            Real Sociedad visits relegation-threatened Espanyol looking to end a three-game winless streak and move closer to second-place Real Madrid in the Spanish league. Sociedad is six points behind Madrid, which won the Club World Cup at the weekend. Sociedad won nine in a row before picking up two losses and a draw. It has won two straight games against Espanyol in the league, but lost three of its last four on the road against the Catalan club. Espanyol sits one point outside the relegation zone and has won only two of its last six six games in all competitions.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808393,China claims it will shoot down 'unidentified object',"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The Chinese government on Sunday (Feb. 12) claimed that an object of unknown origin had been detected off its east coast and that it was preparing to shoot it down.The maritime development authority of Qingdao's Jimo District in Shandong Province said it had spotted an ""unidentified flying object"" off the coast of Rizhao City. It said authorities were preparing to ""shoot it down.""In addition to notifying fishermen to pay attention to safety, it also asked for assistance in taking pictures of the resulting debris and assisting in salvage operations. Based on a screenshot of the announcement posted on The Global Times, The Paper, and other Chinese media, the specific location of the object was 120 degrees 51 minutes east longitude and 35 degrees 37 minutes north latitude.Based on these coordinates, the location where the object was detected was about 62 km southeast of Qingdao.The maritime authority later confirmed to Chinese media outlets that the notice was authentic and reiterated that an ""unidentified flying object had been found in the waters near Rizhao and that preparations were being made to shoot it down."" However, as of publication, there has yet to be any official announcement of the object having been shot down.The closest military facilities in the area are Qingdao Naval Base, Jianggezhuang Naval Base, and Yuchi Naval Base. Qingdao Naval Base is the headquarters of China's North Sea Fleet, Jianggezhuang Naval Base houses attack submarines, and Yuchi Naval Base is the port for the Liaoning aircraft carrier.China's announcement comes as the U.S. on Sunday reported the fourth unidentified anomalous phenomenon (UAP) over North America in eight days. An “octagonal structure” was shot down over Lake Huron, Michigan, after it flew in ""proximity to sensitive"" Department of Defense sites, CNN cited the Pentagon press secretary as saying.Screenshot of maritime development authority announcement. (Weibo screenshot)As of now no NOTAMS have been issued along the Chinese coast.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808394,U.S. shoots down mysterious object near Canadian border,"U.S. military fighter jets on Sunday shot down an octagonal object over Lake Huron, the Pentagon said, the latest incident since a suspected Chinese surveillance balloon put North American security forces on high alert.It was the fourth flying object to be shot down over North America by a U.S. missile in a little more than a week.U.S. Air Force General Glen VanHerck, who is tasked with safeguarding U.S. airspace, told reporters that the military has not been able to identify what the three most recent objects are, how they stay aloft, or where they are coming from.""We're calling them objects, not balloons, for a reason,"" VanHerck, head of North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) and Northern Command, said.Asked if he's ruled out extraterrestrials, VanHerck said he had not ruled out anything yet.""I'll let the intel community and the counterintelligence community figure that out,"" he said.On President Joe Biden's order, a U.S. F-16 fighter shot down the object at 2:42 p.m. local time over Lake Huron on the U.S.-Canada border, Pentagon spokesperson Patrick Ryder said in an official statement.Though it did not pose a military threat, the object could have potentially interfered with domestic air traffic as it was traveling at 20,000 feet (6,100 m), and it might have had surveillance capabilities, Ryder said.The object appeared to be octagonal in structure, with strings hanging off but no discernable payload, said a U.S. official speaking on condition of anonymity.The object was believed to be the same as one recently detected over Montana near sensitive military sites, prompting the closure of U.S. airspace, the Pentagon said. The military will try to recover the object downed over Lake Huron to learn more about it, VanHerck told reporters.He said it likely fell into Canadian waters.The incident raised questions about the spate of unusual objects that have appeared over North American skies in recent weeks and raised tensions with China.""We need the facts about where they are originating from, what their purpose is, and why their frequency is increasing,"" said U.S. Representative Debbie Dingell, one of several Michigan lawmakers who applauded the military for downing the object.U.S. officials identified the first object as a Chinese surveillance balloon and shot it down off the coast of South Carolina on Feb. 4. On Friday, a second object was shot down over sea ice near Deadhorse, Alaska. And a third object was destroyed over Canada's Yukon on Saturday, with investigators still hunting for the wreckage.""The security of citizens is our top priority and that's why I made the decision to have that unidentified object shot down,"" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters on Sunday.North America has been on guard against aerial intrusions following the appearance of the white, eye-catching Chinese airship over American skies earlier this month.That 200-foot-tall (60-meter-high) balloon - which Americans have accused Beijing of using to spy on the United States - caused an international incident, leading Secretary of State Antony Blinken to call off a planned trip to China only hours before he was set to depart.Pentagon officials said they have been scrutinizing radar more closely since then.Surveillance fears appear to have U.S. officials on high alert.Twice in 24 hours, U.S. officials closed airspace - only to reopen it swiftly.On Sunday, the Federal Aviation Administration briefly closed space above Lake Michigan. On Saturday, the U.S. military scrambled fighter jets in Montana to investigate a radar anomaly there.China denies the first balloon was being used for surveillance and says it was a civilian research craft. It condemned the United States for shooting it down off the coast of South Carolina last Saturday.U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told U.S. broadcaster ABC that U.S. officials think two of the latest objects were smaller balloons than the original one.The White House said only that the recently downed objects ""did not closely resemble"" the Chinese balloon, echoing Schumer's description of them as ""much smaller.""""We will not definitively characterize them until we can recover the debris, which we are working on,"" a spokesperson said.DEBRIS IN REMOTE LOCALECanadian counterparts trying to piece together what was shot down over the Yukon may have their own challenges. The territory is a sparsely populated region in Canada's far northwest, which borders Alaska. It can be brutally cold in the winter, but temperatures are unusually mild for this time of year, which could ease the recovery effort.Republican lawmaker Mike Turner, who serves on the U.S. House Armed Services Committee, suggested the White House might be overcompensating for what he described as its previously lax monitoring of American airspace.""They do appear somewhat trigger-happy,"" Turner told CNN on Sunday. ""I would prefer them to be trigger-happy than to be permissive.""Republicans have criticized the Biden administration over its handling of the incursion by the suspected Chinese spy balloon, saying it should have been shot down much earlier.",2023/02/13,273,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808398,Richard E. Grant brings enthusiasm as BAFTA Film Awards host,"LONDON (AP) — There is no bigger cheerleader of awards season than Richard E. Grant.

            He brings joy to the red carpet, snapping selfies with stars and posting congratulations to nominees on social media.

            Now this enthusiasm has been tapped for the EE BAFTA Film Awards on Feb. 19 at the Royal Festival Hall.











            “I’m an unabashed fan of movies and of talent and always have been. I’ve never been disingenuous or, you know, blase about that,” Grant, the host, says.

            “I probably have to restrain myself from permanently taking selfies with every nominee and winner coming up on the stage.""

            “From that point of view, I am the right fit for the job, hopefully,” he says.

            Grant also knows how it feels to participate in awards season and sit, nervously, waiting for that career changing envelope to be opened. He was nominated as supporting actor at both the BAFTAs and Oscars in 2019 for “Can You Ever Forgive Me?”

            And he’s aware that, as a working actor, hosting has its challenges.

            “Traditionally if you’re a comedian, your role is very clear to roast the audience. Whereas I’m an actor and, you know, even though I’m the vast vintage that I am now, I still want to work and collaborate with directors and actors and writers for the remainder of my breathing days,"" he says. ""So roasting them is not really an option and not something that I want to do.”

            When asked if there will be any humor in the ceremony — Grant has jokes.

            “No, It’s going to be very, very serious. There’ll be no jokes and it will be … it’ll be brutally earnest,” he says, laughing.

            Rebel Wilson got mixed reviews for her joke heavy turn as the BAFTA ceremony emcee last March, which at one point involved a cake of Benedict Cumberbatch’s face.

            This year, “All Quiet on the Western Front” leads the nominees with 14. “The Banshees of Inisherin” and “Everything Everywhere All at Once” both have 10 nominations.

            As you’d expect, Grant knows quite a few of the nominees, having worked with EE Rising Star nominees Naomi Ackie and Daryl McCormack, plus Bill Nighy, Cate Blanchett and most of the “Banshees” cast.

            But there will be big changes at the BAFTA Film Awards ceremony this year.

            After six years of walking up the red carpeted steps into the Royal Albert Hall, nominees will be attending an event held beside the River Thames on London’s Southbank at the Royal Festival Hall.

            Also, for the first time, the last 30 minutes of the show will be broadcast live on BBC One, as BAFTA moves toward the idea of a fully live ceremony.

            “In an age where everything can be paused or fast forwarded or, you know, watched on at a later time, the thing of it being live gives it a kind of frisson and excitement and also the possibility that something can go fantastically well or really badly. And that’s always a good thing,"" Grant says.

            British rapper Lil Simz will be performing at the ceremony and both the prince and princess of Wales will be in the audience, as Prince William is president of the British Academy of Film and Television Arts.

            Grant, currently working with script writers on what he’ll be saying on stage, says he’s more excited than nervous, adding he’ll probably be “levitating” on the big day.

            “It is absolutely genuine,” he says of his boundless enthusiasm, “and it’s to the annoyance of some people.”

            “Just surviving in show-business because it is, you know — for what it looks like from the outside — it is a profession that is has an enormous amount of rejection in built into it,"" he says. ""So when people are recognized or succeed at what they’re doing and do it so brilliantly — I’m a great champion of that.”LONDON (AP) — There is no bigger cheerleader of awards season than Richard E.

            Pohto scored the first four points on two free throws and a jumper and the Shockers grabbed an 84-80 lead at the 3:41 mark. Porter's basket gave Wichita State an 88-83 lead with 40 seconds left, but Phelps hit 1 of 2 free throws and turned a Shockers' turnover into a layup to get SMU with two points 10 seconds later. Porter was fouled and hit both foul shots to give Wichita State a two-possession lead.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808404,"Death toll in Turkey, Syria quake tops 33,000; Turkey starts legal action against builders","Rescuers pulled more survivors from the rubble on Sunday, nearly a week after one of the worst earthquakes to hit Turkey and Syria, as Turkish authorities sought to maintain order across the disaster zone and began legal action over building collapses.With chances of finding more survivors growing more remote, the toll in both countries from Monday's earthquake and major aftershocks rose above 33,000 and looked set to keep growing. It was the deadliest quake in Turkey since 1939.In a central district of one of the worst hit cities, Antakya in southern Turkey, business owners emptied their shops on Sunday to prevent merchandise from being stolen by looters.Residents and aid workers who came from other cities cited worsening security conditions, with widespread accounts of businesses and collapsed homes being robbed.Facing questions over his response to the earthquake as he prepares for a national election that is expected to be the toughest of his two decades in power, President Tayyip Erdogan has said the government will deal firmly with looters.In Syria, the disaster hit hardest in the rebel-held northwest, leaving homeless yet again many people who had already been displaced several times by a decade-old civil war. The region has received little aid compared to government-held areas.""We have so far failed the people in north-west Syria,"" United Nations aid chief Martin Griffiths tweeted from the Turkey-Syria border, where only a single crossing is open for U.N. aid supplies.""They rightly feel abandoned,"" Griffiths said, adding that he was focused on addressing that swiftly.Washington called on the Syrian government and all other parties in the country to immediately grant humanitarian access to all those in need.More than six days after the first quake struck, emergency workers still found a handful of people clinging to life in the wreckage of homes that had become tombs for many thousands.A team of Chinese rescuers and Turkish firefighters saved 54-year-old Syrian Malik Milandi after he survived 156 hours in the rubble in Antakya.On the main road into the city the few buildings left standing had large cracks or caved-in facades. Traffic occasionally halted as rescuers called for silence to detect signs of remaining life under the ruins.A father and daughter, a toddler and a 10-year-old girl were among other survivors pulled from the ruins of collapsed buildings Sunday, but such scenes were becoming rare as the number of dead climbed relentlessly.At a funeral near Reyhanli, veiled women wailed and beat their chests as bodies were unloaded from lorries - some in closed wood coffins, others in uncovered coffins, and still others just wrapped in blankets.Some residents sought to retrieve what they could from the destruction.In Elbistan, epicentre of an aftershock almost as powerful as Monday's initial 7.8 magnitude quake, 32-year-old mobile shop owner Mustafa Bahcivan said he had come into town almost daily since then. On Sunday he sifted through the rubble searching for any of his phones that might be still be intact and sellable.""This used to be one of the busiest streets. Now it's completely gone,"" he said.DETENTION ORDERSBuilding quality in a country that lies on several seismic fault lines has come into sharp focus in the aftermath of the quake.Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said 131 suspects had so far been identified as responsible for the collapse of some of the thousands of buildings flattened in the 10 affected provinces.""We will follow this up meticulously until the necessary judicial process is concluded, especially for buildings that suffered heavy damage and buildings that caused deaths and injuries,"" he said.The earthquake hit as Erdogan faces presidential and parliamentary elections scheduled for June. Even before the disaster, his popularity had been falling due to soaring inflation and a slumping Turkish currency.Some affected by the quake and opposition politicians have accused the government of slow and inadequate relief efforts early on, and critics have questioned why the army, which played a key role after a 1999 earthquake, was not brought in sooner.Erdogan has acknowledged problems, such as the challenge of delivering aid despite damaged transport links, but said the situation had been brought under control.SYRIA AID COMPLICATED BY YEARS OF WARIn Syria, the hostilities that have fractured the country during 12 years of civil war are now hindering relief work.Earthquake aid from government-held regions into territory controlled by hardline opposition groups has been held up by approval issues with Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) which controls much of the region, a U.N. spokesperson said.An HTS source in Idlib told Reuters the group would not allow any shipments from government-held areas and that aid would be coming in from Turkey to the north.The U.N. is hoping to ramp up cross-border operations by opening an additional two border points between Turkey and opposition-held Syria for aid deliveries, spokesperson Jens Laerke said.The foreign minister of U.S. ally the United Arab Emirates met Syrian President Bashar al-Assad on Sunday in the first high-level visit by an Arab official since the quake.Several Arab countries have provided support to Assad in the quake's aftermath. Western countries, which sought to isolate Assad after his crackdown on protests in 2011 and the outbreak of civil war, are major contributors to U.N. relief efforts across Syria but have provided little direct aid to Damascus during the civil war.The first shipment of European earthquake aid to government-held parts of Syria also arrived in Damascus on Sunday.U.N Syria envoy Geir Pedersen said in Damascus the United Nations was mobilising funding to support Syria. ""We're trying to tell everyone: Put politics aside, this is a time to unite behind a common effort to support the Syrian people,"" he said.The quake ranks as the world's sixth deadliest natural disaster this century, its death toll exceeding the 31,000 from a quake in neighbouring Iran in 2003.It has killed 29,605 people in Turkey and more than 3,500 in Syria, where tolls have not been updated for two days.Turkey said about 80,000 people were in hospital, and more than 1 million in temporary shelters.",2023/02/13,223,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808408,Philippines' Marcos open to a troop pact with Japan,"President Ferdinand Marcos Jr said on Sunday he saw no reason why the Philippines should not have a Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) with Japan if it would boost maritime security and ensure greater protection for Filipino fishermen.Marcos, however, also told reporters he would exercise care in pursuing a potential pact with Tokyo ""because we do not want to appear provocative.""Marcos' first visit to Japan since taking office came after he recently granted the United States access to additional military bases in the Philippines under a VFA, a move which China said undermined regional stability and raised tensions. The VFA provides rules for the rotation of thousands of U.S. troops in and out of the Philippines for exercises.""If it will be of help to the Philippines in terms of protecting, for example our fishermen, protecting our maritime territory ... I don't see why we should not adopt it (VFA),"" Marcos told reporters before returning home on Sunday, according to an official transcript.Marcos was in Japan for a five-day visit, to forge closer security ties with Tokyo, which in December announced its biggest military-build up since World War Two, fuelled by concerns about aggressive Chinese actions in the region.Marcos and Prime Minister Fumio Kishida penned a deal to allow their armed forces to work together during disaster relief, an agreement seen as a step towards a broader pact that could allow the countries to deploy forces on each other's soil.""I always think about the need to protect our fishermen. We need to show clearly we are patrolling our waters and making sure that our maritime territory is clearly recognised,"" Marcos said.The Philippines has a VFA with the United States, while Tokyo has VFAs with Australia and Britain, and also hosts the biggest concentration of U.S. forces abroad.Japan held military exercises with the United States and the Philippines as recently as October, and its military presence in the Philippines could help counter Chinese influence in the South China Sea, much of which Beijing claims, including the territory that Manila considers its own.Kishida said the Philippines and Japan had agreed to try and establish a framework that would ""strengthen and smooth the process of holding joint exercises"".In an interview with Nikkei on Sunday, Marcos said his country could be pulled into a possible conflict in the Taiwan Strait because of its proximity to the self-ruled island regarded by China as a breakaway province.""When we look at the situation in the area, especially the tensions in the Taiwan Strait, we can see that just by our geographical location, should there in fact be conflict in that area ... it's very hard to imagine a scenario where the Philippines will not somehow get involved,"" Marcos said.(Reporting by Karen LemaEditing by Ed Davies)",2023/02/13,286,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808409,"After spy balloon incident, can China and the U.S. talk again?","When U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken this month called off his trip to Beijing, he chose his words carefully. China's launch of a spy balloon on a high-altitude journey over the United States was unacceptable and irresponsible, he said, but he was postponing - not canceling - his visit.A week later, China's balloon has been shot down, the trip remains unscheduled, and the Friday and Saturday downing of two unidentified aircraft over Alaska and Canada raised questions about whether an adversary had sent more spy vessels into North American airspace.Still, say analysts, the two countries have strong reasons to manage their disagreements. The question now is when, not whether, they find their way back to the negotiating table.""Secretary Blinken ... talked about postponing the trip, not canceling it or ending all foreseeable high-level communication with the Chinese government,"" U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said last week. ""That is not going to happen.""China wants to revive its economy, still reeling from the crushing zero-Covid policy. To that end, Chinese President Xi Jinping hopes to improve relations that hit a dangerous low in August with the visit to Taiwan by then-U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and to persuade U.S. lawmakers not to push new rules aimed at thwarting China's efforts to produce advanced semiconductors.And while U.S. observers had low hopes for Blinken's China trip, diplomats say a high-level visit is needed to put a ""floor"" under the relationship and to make progress on issues ranging from Chinese fentanyl to Americans detained in the country.OUTRAGE AND HYPOCRISYRestarting talks won't be easy. The balloon flight caused outrage in Washington, with politicians criticizing the U.S. military and U.S. President Joe Biden for failing to shoot it down when it first entered U.S. airspace.China's foreign ministry has reacted angrily to Washington's spying allegations, saying the balloon was a civilian research craft and accusing the United States of hypocrisy.The Pentagon said last week that China declined a U.S. request for a phone call between Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Chinese Defense Minister Wei Fenghe.This doesn't mean re-engagement can't happen, however.""While it's all too common for the Chinese to refuse to engage in the military-military channel when it is needed the most — in a crisis — that doesn't mean the Chinese have given up on their effort to buy time by calming relations with the U.S. and the West,"" said Daniel Russel, the top U.S. diplomat for East Asia under former President Barack Obama.U.S. leaders have also said communication channels must stay open even while calling the episode a violation of U.S. sovereignty, briefing dozens of countries on what they say is a global Chinese surveillance program and adding six Chinese entities to a trade blacklist.Biden has said the balloon needed to be shot down, but has played down both the security threat and the impact on U.S.-China relations.On Thursday, he said the incident was not a major security breach while noting that ""the total amount of intelligence gathering that's going on by every country around the world is overwhelming.""GIVE TALKS A CHANCEShort of a high-level visit, there are opportunities for diplomacy. In a report from Berlin, Politico cited diplomats as saying that China's top diplomat Wang Yi, whom Blinken was to meet in Beijing, would attend this year's Munich Security Conference, which is slated for Feb. 17-19.Blinken will also attend the event, though neither side has said the two might meet there.Another chance will be a China trip by U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. On Wednesday Yellen said she still hoped to go to China, giving no details on timing, and China's commerce ministry said on Thursday it welcomed her willingness to visit.While helpful, such meetings can only set the stage for the in-depth, high-level dialogue needed to steady ties.Blinken could meet with the Chinese in Munich or at the G20 foreign ministers meeting in India in March, but he needs to visit Beijing and meet face-to-face with Xi to ensure messages on thorny issues like Taiwan and Russia get through, Russel said.New U.S. restrictions on Chinese companies and Republican House Committee Chairman Mike McCaul's announced desire to visit Chinese-claimed Taiwan in April ""could prove the straws that break the back"" of such efforts, he added.Bonnie Glaser, an Asia expert at the German Marshall Fund of the United States, cautioned that domestic pressures in both countries may mean it is too early for either side to re-engage.""The Chinese don't want to look weak and they probably don't want to admit that they lied (about the balloon). President Biden is also under pressure from Republicans in Congress who insist the balloon should have been shot down sooner,"" said Glaser.(Reporting by David Brunnstrom and Michael Martina; Additional reporting by Simon Lewis in Washington and Echo Wang in New YorkEditing by Don Durfee and Deepa Babington)",2023/02/13,302,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808411,"Super Bowl ads use celebs, humor, lots of dogs","NEW YORK (AP) — Advertisers bet big that viewers were turning to the Super Bowl for a comforting escape, and delivered a series of advertisements that relied on familiar celebrity faces, light humor, and plenty of cuddly dogs.

            This wasn’t a year for edgy humor or experimentation. After the global pandemic, with economic uncertainty looming ahead and the war in Ukraine stretching on, advertisers just wanted people to feel good.

            And it worked.











            “This year’s ads took a very light touch and focused on being fun and making the viewer feel good,” said Charles Taylor, marketing professor at Villanova University. “Most followed a clear formula of combining A-list celebrities with humor, with some using nostalgia and/or music to good effect.”

            Super Bowl advertisers each year try to reach the more than 100 million people tuning into the broadcast. It's a pricey proposition: ads can cost as much as $7 million for 30 seconds.

            It was a year of change for the Super Bowl since other alcohol ads were allowed to air after Anheuser-Bush gave up its exclusivity deal and the halftime show sponsor changed from Pepsi to Apple music after a decade.

            STARRY NIGHT

            Many of the ads were released early, but there were still some surprises in store for viewers. In its first Super Bowl ad, Dunkin' Donuts enlisted superfan Ben Affleck and wife Jennifer Lopez. 

            In the ad, Affleck mans the drive-through booth at a Dunkin’ Donuts in Medford, Massachusetts, with a Boston accent and shocks customers. Lopez comes through the line of cars and asks him what he’s doing. “You’re embarrassing me in front of my friends,” he says. “Grab me a glazed,” she demands. Affleck has a long association with the brand, and is often spotted carrying Dunkin’ Donuts drinks in paparazzi photos. He directed the ad, too.

            GM and Netflix enlisted Will Ferrell to tout their deal to show more electric vehicles in Netflix shows. Bud Light's ad showed Miles Teller and his wife Keleigh and dog Bugsy, who all dance to hold music. Melissa McCarthy sings a jingle for Booking.com, and Adam Driver makes multiples of himself for Squarespace. Pepsi Zero Sugar hired Ben Stiller and Steve Martin. Avocados From Mexico enlists Anna Faris for one of the few slightly risque ads this year that envisions a present where everyone is naked — including the Statue of Liberty. Tennis star Serena Williams stars in two ads: one for Michelob Ultra and one for Remy Martin. T-Mobile enlisted Bradley Cooper and his mom to star in a blooper-filled ad. 

            One unusual star: a group of donors bought two ads to feature Jesus in a campaign called “He Gets Us.”

            And U2 ran an ad announcing its Las Vegas residency that showed unidentified orbs floating over cities. One of the orbs has a baby in it who says “Achtung!”. U2′s shows are opening up a venue called MSG Sphere, so the orbs make sense. But coming the same day the U.S. announced it shot down a fourth unidentified flying object, the images of orbs floating over cities struck a jarring tone. 

            NOSTALGIA FEST

            Many marketers tried to capitalize on well-loved TV and movie properties. This year, online shopping site Rakuten hired Alicia Silverstone and Elisa Donovan to recreate a scene from 90s rom-com “Clueless.” Popcorners, a snack brand from Frito-Lay, brought back “Breaking Bad,” which first aired in 2008, with stars Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul.

            Other advertisers trying to capitalize on favorite content from years past: T-Mobile’s ad showed John Travolta singing a T-Mobile home internet-themed version of “Summer Nights” from “Grease” with “Scrubs” stars Donald Faison and Zach Braff. Michelob Ultra evoked “Caddyshack” by setting its ad at the Bushwood Country Club that’s in the movie.

            LIGHT HUMOR

            Those not using celebrities opted for humor. Kia showed a dad on an epic quest to pick up his child's forgotten “binky.” And E(asterisk)Trade brought back its famous talking babies: this time, they attend a wedding. Some ads were offbeat: a Tubi ad showed giant blue rabbits throwing people into holes to demonstrate the idea that Tubi helps people “find rabbit holes you didn't know you were looking for.”

            Ram's ad went slightly risque and poked fun at erectile dysfunction ads by having couples talk about “premature electrification.” Villanova's Taylor said that approach just might work. 

            “Given the turn the Super Bowl has taken away from sexual appeals or humor over the past decade this will make the ad stand out and generate buzz,” Taylor said. “While they are risking offending some consumers I think the ad will be well remembered and mostly well received.”

            CUTE ANIMALS

            It's not a Super Bowl without cute animals — particularly dogs. 

            Jeep stuffed a bevy of animals, including meercats, a bee, a bear, a goat and many others, in its ad that shows the animals dancing to a tune emanating from a Jeep 4xe. The dog food subscription service called The Farmer’s Dog showed a heartwarming tale of a girl growing older with her dog.

            Other ads feature dogs alongside celebrities: a Skechers ad shows Snoop Dogg shaving a poodle; Pringles shows Meghan Trainor cuddling with her dog and Pepsi Zero Sugar shows Steve Martin as a vet operating on a dog. Amazon's ad shows a family getting a puppy companion for their older dog.

            STUNTS

            Advertisers sometimes try stunts to capture attention. The biggest one this year was from FanDuel, which enlisted former NFL player Rob Gronkowsi to try to kick a field goal live during the broadcast. 

            If he made it, customers who wagered at least $5 on the Super Bowl were to get a share of $10 million in free bets. But the problem with stunts is they're risky. FanDuel caused confusion with its ad, which appeared to show Gronkowski making the kick. But FanDuel said he missed but announced bettors would still get a share of $10 million in free bets. 

            More successfully, Peacock’s late-game ad tried a stunt by acknowledging other ads. The concept behind its show “Poker Face” is that Charlie, played by Natasha Lyonne, can tell when someone is lying. The ad shows Lyonne watching the game with a companion at a bar. She tells him that the M&M’s characters “never left” and a kid in the Google Pixel ad is actually 19 -- both references to ads that aired earlier in the game. Peacock says it created the ad in partnership with Google and M&Ms.NEW YORK (AP) — Advertisers bet big that viewers were turning to the Super Bowl for a comforting escape, and delivered a series of advertisements that relied on familiar celebrity faces, light humor, and plenty of cuddly dogs.This wasn’t a year for edgy humor or experimentation.

There is also a contradictory discrepancy between two key subsidiaries' accounts payable and accounts receivable. These types of seemingly innocuous misstatements are, instead, often signs of cooked books because it can become quite a strain to keep the numbers straight once you start manipulating them."" In addition, the report stated that ""Management and directors dumped an extraordinary ~$1 billion in shares within the first five months of DLO being public. A spate of recent high-level departures brings to mind the idiom about 'rats fleeing a sinking ship.'""On this news, DLocal's stock price fell $10.76 per share, or 50%, to close at $10.46 per share on November 16, 2022.Then, on December 1, 2022, Muddy Waters published a second report stating that DLocal has held calls with clients from several banks, stressing that it had separated client funds from its own. The report also said that DLocal's calls with clients were ""non-specific"" and ""sweet-talking,"" and that ""all [the Company] needed to do to address this issue was provide an explanation as to how the cash flows reconcile.""On this news, DLocal's stock price fell $2.21 per share, or 15%, to close at $12.39 per share on December 1, 2022.WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808421,Eagles take Super Bowl lead behind 4th down conversions,"GLENDALE, Ariz. (AP) — Nick Sirianni's fourth-down aggressiveness paid off in a big way early for the Philadelphia Eagles in the Super Bowl.

            Sirianni had his offense go for it twice on fourth down on a single drive late in the first half and another in the third quarter, helping them take lead over the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday.

            But they were unable to hold onto it and lost 38-35 on a field goal by Harrison Butker in the closing seconds.











            The Eagles have now converted a league-high 27 fourth-down tries in the regular season and playoffs. Sirianni ranked No. 1 in the regular season in the Football Outsiders’ Critical Call Index.

            The analytics company has one of the best models for determining when NFL teams should go and when they should kick on fourth downs, using its win probability model that relies on historical play-by-play data adjusted for variables such as the strength and weaknesses of both teams, injuries and other factors.

            The first call was particularly bold, coming on fourth-and-5 from the Kansas City 44. No team since at least the 2000 season had attempted a fourth-down try in the first half of a Super Bowl when needing more than a yard.

            But Sirianni showed confidence in quarterback Jalen Hurts, who scampered through a big hole for a 28-yard run that was the longest run ever by a quarterback in the Super Bowl. 

            The next try was less risky on fourth-and-2 from the Chiefs 8 and the Eagles got the Chiefs to jump offside. Hurts ran it in from 4 yards on the next play.

            Hurts then converted a fourth-and-1 sneak from the Kansas City 21 in the third quarter before the Eagles finally settled for a 33-yard field goal on fourth-and-6.

            Fourth down conversions proved crucial in the Eagles previous trip to the Super Bowl following the 2017 season. Coach Doug Pederson dialed up the famous “Philly Special” call at the end of the first half that led to a trick play TD pass from Trey Burton to quarterback Nick Foles and a fourth-and-1 conversion in Eagles territory that helped spark the game-winning drive in the fourth quarter.

            Chiefs coach Andy Reid has typically had a more old-school approach on fourth downs and ranked 28th in Football Outsiders' Critical Call Index. Reid opted for a field goal in the first quarter on fourth-and-3 from the Eagles 24 in a move that backfired when Harrison Butker missed it from 42 yards.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808422,Super Bowl MVP Mahomes rallies Chiefs to win on hurt ankle,"GLENDALE, Ariz. (AP) — Patrick Mahomes and his ailing right ankle are headed for another Super Bowl victory parade.

            After aggravating the sprained ankle he suffered three weeks ago, the All-Pro quarterback led the Kansas City Chiefs to a thrilling 38-35 come-from-behind victory over the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday, hoisting his second Lombardi Trophy and taking with it the game's MVP honor for the second time in his career.

            Mahomes finished with 182 yards passing and three touchdowns, but he was especially brilliant on his hurt ankle in the second half: 13 of 14 for 93 yards and two touchdowns. The league's MVP also had 44 yards rushing, including his 26-yard sprint with just over 2 minutes left in a 35-all game as Kansas City was driving for the go-ahead score.











            Harrison Butker provided it with his 27-yard field goal with 8 seconds to go.

            “I told you all this week there's nothing that's going to keep me off that football field,” said Mahomes, who hurt the ankle in the divisional round against Jacksonville. “I just want a shoutout to my teammates — we challenged each other, we needed everyone to win this football game — so shoutout to my teammates. We're Super Bowl champs!”

            Mahomes helped the Chiefs end a 50-year title drought when he led the Chiefs past the 49ers in 2020. Three years later, the do-everything quarterback has delivered a third Lombardi Trophy to Kansas City while joining Tom Brady, Joe Montana, Bart Starr, Eli Manning and Terry Bradshaw as the only players to win multiple Super Bowl MVPs.

            “He strives to be the greatest, without saying anything,” Chiefs coach Andy Reid said. ""That’s the way he works. He wants to be the greatest player ever.”

            Mahomes reinjured his ankle late in the first half Sunday when Eagles linebacker T.J. Edwards spun him to the ground. He lay there for several seconds before hobbling off the field in a scene eerily reminiscent of earlier in the playoffs.

            Mahomes said he didn't get a painkilling shot at halftime, but he no doubt benefited from a longer halftime to allow for Rihanna's performance. And by the time the field was cleared of the stage, No. 15 was at the head of the pack as he led the Chiefs back to the field, facing a 24-14 deficit but knowing they would get the opening kickoff.

            Mahomes promptly marched them 75 yards and Isiah Pacheco crashed into the end zone to close within 24-21. When the Eagles answered with a field goal, Mahomes led another 75-yard TD march. And a 65-yard punt return by Kadarius Toney set up Mahomes' 4-yard TD toss to a wide-open Skyy Moore that made it 35-27 in the fourth quarter.

            Mahomes' final scoring drive was pure guts.

            The Eagles had just scored and made the 2-point conversion to knot the game 35-all with 5:15 left when Mahomes hit JuJu Smith-Schuster for a first down. He completed another pass to Travis Kelce, then Mahomes escaped on a long scramble — just like his one that set up their winning field goal against the Bengals in the AFC title game.

            This time, the Chiefs kept going. They benefited from a defensive holding call on third-and-8 against Eagles cornerback James Bradberry, then got down to the goal line before killing the clock and sending Butker onto the field for what turned out to be the winning field goal.

            “It hasn’t even sank in yet. I appreciate it because of the failures,” said Mahomes, whose Chiefs lost to the Buccaneers in the Super Bowl two years ago. ""It gives you a greater appreciation to be standing here as a champion.”

            Mahomes' ankle was a big question mark for the AFC championship game, when he only had a week to recover from the initial injury sustained against Jacksonville. But with two weeks to rest it, Mahomes had insisted all week that he was good to go in the Super Bowl, and Reid likewise said his star quarterback had no limitations.

            Mahomes was moving around well in the first half Sunday, too. He scrambled for a big gain on Kansas City's opening series and was doing a good job of buying time against the NFL's top-ranked team in sacks this season.

            The Chiefs were trying to match a touchdown that gave Philadelphia a 21-14 lead when Mahomes went down again.

            He was flushed from the pocket, stepped forward and scrambled to his left, then Edwards lassoed him and spun him to the ground. Mahomes lay there for a moment with his facemask buried in the turf before getting to his feet and hobbling to the sideline in a near-carbon copy of the scene from three weeks ago at Arrowhead Stadium.

            That night, Mahomes came back after halftime to lead the Chiefs to victory to keep their Super Bowl hopes alive.

            He did the same thing on the biggest of stages Sunday night.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808424,"Victory Securities Holds "" HONG KONG'S FIRST VIRTUAL ASSET RESEARCH CONFERENCE"", analyzing the future potential of virtual assets","HONG KONG SAR -  Media OutReach - 13 February 2023 - Victory Securities held the ""HONG KONG'S FIRST VIRTUAL ASSET RESEARCH CONFERENCE"", detailing an overview of the cryptocurrency market and analyzing the impact of external factors on the cryptocurrency market. At the press conference, a panel of experts in the virtual asset industry discussed how to revolutionize the virtual asset industry.   Adam Zhou, Managing Director of Victory Securities, categorically recognized the future value of virtual assets by stating ""Through blockchain technology, virtual assets can be traded globally, and Ethereum smart contracts further expand application of cryptocurrency.""   Prominent experts in the field shared their insights at the press conferences, including Alvin Kwock, Founder & CEO of OneDegree, Professor Jack Poon, Professor of Practice at PolyU, Candy Pan, Director of Deloitte Financial Services, Karen Man, Partner at Baker & McKenzie, and Kennix Chan, Executive Director of Victory Securities & VDX, exploring ways to innovate in the virtual asset industry.   Karen Man believed that by bringing virtual assets into an open regulatory environment, international virtual asset investors may come to the Hong Kong market to develop projects such as stablecoins and exchanges.   Alvin Kwock proposed the idea that insurance can be a means to effectively control the risk of virtual assets. However, only 25% of companies have sufficient risk control measures to secure an insurance policy. He believed that there is a huge demand for virtual asset insurance in Hong Kong, leaving significant room for growth in the number of compliance agencies insuring against virtual assets in the next two years.   In addition, Candy Pan believed that regulatory technology and compliance technology (Regtech) are crucial to the development of virtual assets. Through the application of financial technology such as artificial intelligence, it is possible to quickly identify customers and track the flow of money.   Concerning investor risks and regulatory agencies, Kennix Chan pointed out that Hong Kong has a sound traditional financial system that can effectively supervise virtual assets, thereby accelerating the development of the virtual asset industry.   Jack Poon viewed supervision as the first step in the development of virtual assets. To him, development of the technology is essential to ensuring the sustainability of virtual assets in the future.   At the end of the press conference, Kennix Chan spoke about the outlook, ""I hope that the Hong Kong Government will communicate more with the industry, educate people about virtual assets and formulate policies to attract talents, so as to set a clear blueprint for the development of virtual assets for the industry to follow.""

She finished 208 bowls weighing 10 grams each in five minutes.Before her trip to Japan, she trained by eating different kinds of Japanese food. According to her YouTube channel, she finished 88 plates of sushi in 45 minutes, and 15 bowls of beef over rice also in 45 minutes.After winning second place, she shared that she was nervous and stressed about competing abroad. “It is not only the capacity of my stomach or fast eating speed to win the competition, but also the rapport with my noodle giver,” Hsiao Hui said.Hsiao Hui wins second place at a Japanese competitive eating contest. (YouTube)She started her professional competitive eating career last year after winning first place at a bento eating contest in Fenqihu, where she finished eight bento boxes in 25 minutes.She shared in a clip that her career was triggered by her desire to prove to her family that she could do it and added that “I am very pleased that I balance my hobby and work now.” She said exercising and getting regular health checkups will hopefully help her compete for a longer time.Hsiao Hui claimed she was also the first person in Taiwan to finish a 7 kg bowl of braised pork rice in 42 minutes.

            ""When we look at the situation in the area, especially the tensions in the Taiwan Strait, we can see that just by our geographical location, should there in fact be conflict in that area ... it's very hard to imagine a scenario where the Philippines will not somehow get involved,"" Nikkei quoted him as saying.

            Marcos mentioned that a 40-minute flight is all it takes to get Kaohsiung from his home province of Ilocos Norte in the northern Philippines. ""We feel that we're very much on the front line,"" he said.

            If a conflict broke out, his priority would be the well-being of the 150,000 Filipinos in Taiwan, the president said. The Philippines is committed to peace and protecting its national interests, he said.











            Marcos stressed that differences should be solved through diplomacy instead of with force. ""I sincerely believe that nobody wants to go to war... But we have continued to advise and to counsel all the parties involved to show restraint,"" he said.

            Ultimately, the president said his nation is most concerned about ensuring “safe passage through the South China Sea,"" where roughly US$3.37 trillion (NT$102 trillion) worth of trade passes through each year.

            ""Many of our economies depend on it. Japan, including China even,"" he said. ""That is something that's very, very important to all of us around the region.""

            On Feb. 2, the Philippines and the U.S. announced the acceleration of their Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA), which bolsters military training, exercises, and interoperability between the two countries, according to a Pentagon statement.

            As part of the agreement, the U.S. has set aside US$82 million for infrastructure improvements at five current EDCA sites in the Philippines and expanded its military presence to four new sites across the Southeast Asian country.

            The U.S. and the Philippines also agreed to resume joint maritime patrols in the South China Sea to address regional security challenges in the Indo-Pacific.

            Additionally, Marcos met with Japanese Prime Minister Kishida Fumio during a visit to Japan on Thursday (Feb. 9) and agreed to host Japanese soldiers for joint natural and humanitarian disaster response training, per Deutsche Welle.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808507,AP source: Cavaliers to sign veteran swingman Danny Green,"CLEVELAND (AP) — Danny Green will sign with the Cleveland Cavaliers once the free agent swingman and three-time NBA champion clears waivers, a person familiar with the agreement told The Associated Press on Sunday.

            Green, who began his pro career with Cleveland in 2009, is expected to rejoin the Cavs in the next two days, said the person who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because the team is not commenting on its interest in him.

            Green drew interest from several contending teams but chose to rejoin the Cavs, who will add another outside shooter, a valued veteran and player with extensive postseason experience. Green has appeared in 165 playoff games over 14 seasons.











            While his agent was talking with the Cavs, Green posted about his status on Twitter, saying, “It’s not done yet ... .”

            Cavaliers All-Star guard Donovan Mitchell then posted a “welcome back” video of Green dancing on the sideline during his first stint with Cleveland.

            The Cavs haven’t been to the playoffs since 2018, but are poised to return for the first time since LeBron James left after four straight Finals appearances.

            Cleveland has won six straight and currently is the No. 4 seed in the Eastern Conference standings.

            Green became available after working out a contract buyout from Houston, which acquired him at the trade deadline from Memphis. He played in just three games with the Grizzlies this season after tearing knee ligaments during the playoffs last season with the Philadelphia 76ers.

            The Cavaliers didn’t make any moves at the deadline, but president of basketball operations Koby Altman said the team would explore the buyout market.

            Green has averaged 12.4 points and 4.9 rebounds over 14 seasons with the Cavs, Spurs, Raptors, Lakers, Sixers and Grizzlies.

            He has made 39.9% percent of his career 3-pointers. Green played college ball at North Carolina.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808508,Super Bowl field turns into a super slip and slide,"GLENDALE, Ariz. (AP) — The field at State Farm Stadium turned into a Super Bowl slip and slide.

            With the surface seeming to get worse as the night wore on, players from both teams had a hard time keeping their footing on Sunday, leading several to change their cleats during a game that ended with the Kansas City Chiefs' dramatic 38-35 comeback win over the Philadelphia Eagles. 

            “It was like playing on a water park,"" Eagles left tackle Jordan Mailata said.











            State Farm Stadium has a history of slippery fields.

            Players complained about field conditions at the BCS National Championship between Oregon and Auburn in 2010. Same thing in the College Football Playoff title game between Alabama and Clemson in 2015. The Fiesta Bowl has had its share of grassy slipups as well.

            The Super Bowl was no different — even after the NFL spent nearly two years preparing the field.

            Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes slipped while trying to make a cut, but was able to gain a few more yards. Kansas City receiver Skyy Moore lost his footing on a jet sweep and running back Isiah Pacheco even slipped during his celebration after scoring a touchdown.

            Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts and tight end Dallas Goedert were among the players who changed cleats to get better traction.

            “I changed my cleats and right before the second half wore the different ones,"" Goedert said. “The second half, you know, the field was tearing up a little bit but, you know, once again, we’re playing on the same field as the Chiefs.”

            It's not the first time this season Kansas City has had footing problems at State Farm Stadium.

            In their season opener against the Arizona Cardinals, the Chiefs had all kinds of trouble with the playing surface. 

            First-round pick Trent McDuffie, who had earned a starting job, injured his hamstring when he slipped and end up on injured reserve. 

            Kicker Harrison Butker also got injured when his plant foot slipped on a kickoff, forcing him to miss games and ultimately change his entire approach to kicking for the remainder of the season.

            It happened again in the Super Bowl, though both teams felt the slippage.

            “It’s not like we were playing on the on ice and they were playing on grass,” Eagles coach Nick Sirianni said. “We all had to play on it, we all have to figure out our shoes.” 

            The grass at State Farm Stadium is on a giant tray that is rolled in and out of the retractable roof stadium. The field sits out in the Arizona sun on warm days and is brought back inside when it gets cold.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808509,"Rihanna is pregnant again, rep says after Super Bowl show","GLENDALE, Ariz. (AP) — Rihanna was pregnant with her second child as she performed her Super Bowl halftime show Sunday. 

            The singer’s representative confirmed the pregnancy shortly after she ended her 13-minute set at Super Bowl 57. She hovered high at times as she performed a number of hits including “We Found Love,"" “Diamonds"" and “Work” during a halftime break between the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles at the State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. 

            The baby bump that was visible in the tight clothes she wore under her baggy red jumpsuit set off a wave of social media speculation that she might be pregnant again. 











            Rihanna, 34, has a 9-month-old son with rapper A$AP Rocky.

            During her media preview Thursday, Rihanna said she was initially unsure about taking on the challenge of performing during a time when she was three months postpartum and wondered “should I be making major decisions like this right now? I might regret this.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808510,"Warriors go through with four-team trade, acquiring Payton","SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — The Golden State Warriors have decided to go through with completion of a trade to acquire Gary Payton II from Portland despite concerns that arose surrounding the guard's health following offseason surgery for a core muscle injury that sidelined him until last month.

            A person with direct knowledge of the situation said Sunday that the Warriors spoke to the NBA about how the Trail Blazers handled the deal and information about the medical situation for Payton, whose physical Friday brought up issues that put the trade in jeopardy. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because no details of the negotiations and discussions were made public.

            The defending champions had until Sunday night to make a decision whether to rescind the swap that sent center James Wiseman to Detroit. Golden State also will receive unprotected 2026 and ‘28 second-round draft picks from Portland while giving up Memphis’ 2026 second-round pick and its own 2028 second-round selection to Portland.











            The Pistons traded forward Saddiq Bey to the Hawks and the Blazers acquire forward Kevin Knox II from the Detroit along with three conditional second-round picks from the Hawks.

            The 30-year-old Payton played a key role as a defensive stopper for Golden State during last season’s title run and would immediately provide backcourt depth with Stephen Curry sidelined at least until after the All-Star break with a left leg injury.

            Payton's status for the rest of the season is unclear. He played against Golden State in a win Wednesday night at Portland before rejoining his former team ahead of the trade deadline a day later. Payton is averaging 4.1 points, 2.6 rebounds and 1.5 assists over 15 games.

Bowtie, Hong Kong's first virtual insurance company, is devoted to reducing costs with technology. Throughout the past 3 years, Bowtie has been offering free upgrades on its  VHIS coverage, allowing HongKongers to enjoy more comprehensive medical protection at a more affordable premium.    Hong Kong Medical Inflation Rate Reaches 8.8%  According to the  2023 Global Medical Trends Survey by WTW, a multinational insurance consulting company, the global inflation and pandemic have led to a surge in healthcare usage, pushing the global medical costs to a nearly 15-years high.   It is estimated that the global average medical inflation rate will rise from 8.8% in 2022 to almost 10% in 2023, and during the same period, Hong Kong's medical inflation rate will rise from 8.2% to 8.8%.            2021    2022    2023      Global            8.2%                    8.8%                    10%              Hong Kong            7.5%                    8.2%                    8.8%              Source: Global Medical Trends Survey by WTW    Bowtie Offers Upgraded Coverage Instead of a Raise  Medical inflation will inevitably make the public bear burdens while leading to higher operating costs for insurers as they have to pay out more for medical treatment. However, Bowtie, as the first virtual insurance company in Hong Kong, is committed to providing better protection at the best possible premium via reducing unnecessary costs through technology.   Instead of increasing its voluntary medical insurance premiums,  Bowtie has continued to provide a series of free coverage upgrades over the past 3 years, despite the recent inflationary spike. Bowtie  VHIS Flexi Regular and  VHIS Flexi Plus have upgraded 7 benefits, mostly around 4 areas. For example, surgeon's Fee, anesthetist's fee and operating theatre fees were increased by 20% to reduce out-of-pocket expenses, room and board and miscellaneous charges were enhanced 5-29% to reduce customer shortfalls, and the pre- and post-confinement outpatient care coverage was increased by 18-55%.

However, a senior official was quoted by Financial Times on Monday (Feb. 13) as saying that Chinese military surveillance balloons have been entering Taiwan's airspace ""very frequently"" with the most recent incursion taking place ""a few weeks ago.""Another source familiar with the matter told the newspaper that the intrusions are averaging ""once a month."" It also cited Taiwanese officials as saying that Chinese-made balloons fly at about 20,000 feet and their dimensions and payload exceed those of weather balloons designated for flights over sovereign airspace.The news agency cited military and intelligence experts as saying that the balloons detected over Taiwan were devised by the Equipment Development Department of the Central Military Commission. According to one Taiwanese official, some of the balloons are launched by the People's Liberation Army Air Force, while others are dispatched by the People's Liberation Army Rocket Force.According to sources in Taiwan and a U.S. ally, the balloons are measuring atmospheric data to improve the accuracy of radar and missile systems. Such atmospheric measurements need to be constantly updated to take into account seasonal and yearly changes.The MND has yet to respond to a request from Taiwan News to comment on the claims of regular intrusions by Chinese spy balloons over Taiwan.",2023/02/13,3587,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808547,"Super Bowl magic: Mahomes, Chiefs beat Eagles 38-35","GLENDALE, Ariz. (AP) — Patrick Mahomes was magical when the Kansas City Chiefs desperately needed him to pull off another Super Bowl comeback.

            Playing on an injured ankle, Mahomes threw two touchdown passes in the fourth quarter and scrambled 26 yards on the go-ahead drive before Harrison Butker kicked a 27-yard field goal with 8 seconds left to give the Chiefs a 38-35 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday night.

            The Chiefs won their second NFL title in four years and two-time NFL MVP Mahomes earned his second Super Bowl MVP award. 











            “I thought guys just embraced the moment,” Mahomes said about rallying from a 10-point halftime deficit. “In that first half, we were playing and doing some good stuff, but I felt like the guys were getting consumed by everything around us.”

            Mahomes and Jalen Hurts excelled in the first Super Bowl matchup featuring two Black starting QBs. But Mahomes turned it up in the second half after reaggravating a sprained right ankle.

            “It took everybody to win the game,” Mahomes shouted as red and yellow confetti littered the field.

            Coach Andy Reid, who couldn’t win the big game in Philadelphia, beat his former team to earn his second ring with Mahomes and the Chiefs. 

            “We wanted to get this so bad for him,” Travis Kelce said. “His legacy in Philly lives on forever. ... There’s a lot of pride in knowing that he’s had success in two different organizations, but this was the better one.”

            With the score tied at 35-35, the Eagles tried to let the Chiefs score a touchdown with under two minutes left so they could get the ball back after a defensive holding call on cornerback James Bradberry on third-and-8 gave Kansas City a first down. But Jerick McKinnon slid at the 2, forcing the Eagles to use their last timeout.

            “It was holding. I tugged his jersey. I was hoping they would let it slide,” Bradberry said.

            After Mahomes took a knee twice, Butker nailed his kick, sending thousands of red-clad Chiefs fans into a frenzy. 

            “It feels amazing just to see the confetti,” said Butker, who missed a 42-yarder in the first quarter. “I just tried to focus on one kick and focusing on the process.”

            The Chiefs won their second Super Bowl following the 2019 season, 50 years after the first one. Mahomes led them back from a 10-point deficit in the fourth quarter against San Francisco in that one. It took just three years to get another Lombardi.

            Chiefs fans were outnumbered in the stadium, but did their part to silence the boisterous Philly fans with the tomahawk chop chant.

            Down 24-14 with a limping Mahomes, the Chiefs (17-3) followed up Rihanna’s electrifying halftime performance with a sensational offensive outburst.

            Mahomes, who suffered a high ankle sprain in the divisional round, hurt it again on a 3-yard scramble late in the second quarter. He limped off the field but showed no ill effects on Kansas City’s next possession.

            “I knew it was pretty bad when he got up limping but I knew it wasn’t gonna be bad enough to where he was gonna pull himself off the field,” Chiefs offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy said. “If we would’ve pulled him off, I would’ve had to fight him. He would’ve probably fought me. And so it wasn’t worth entertaining.” 

            Mahomes slipped — several players lost their footing on the natural grass surface — in the pocket yet somehow regained his balance and scrambled 14 yards to the Eagles 4, setting up Isiah Pacheco’s 1-yard TD run that cut the deficit to 24-21. 

            Mahomes then tossed a 5-yard TD pass to a wide-open Kadarius Toney to give Kansas City its first lead, 28-27, early in the fourth quarter.

            After the Chiefs tightened up their defense, forcing Philly to punt, Toney returned a line-drive kick 65 yards to the Eagles 5 for the longest punt return in Super Bowl history.

            On third down from the 4, Mahomes connected with Skyy Moore to extend their lead to 35-27. Moore also was wide open on the play. 

            But the Eagles wouldn’t go away.

            Hurts hit DeVonta Smith for a 45-yard gain to the Chiefs 2 and ran in for his third score of the game. He also ran in for the 2-point conversion to tie it at 35-35 with 5:15 to go.

            As “Fly! Eagles! Fly!” reverberated throughout the stadium, Mahomes and the Chiefs went back to work.

            The 27-year-old Mahomes became the third player to win his second NFL MVP award before age 28. He also became the youngest QB to start three Super Bowls. Mahomes finally broke the MVP curse, becoming the first player to win the Super Bowl the same season after nine straight players lost.

            Just five years after winning the first Super Bowl in franchise history, the Eagles (16-4) came close with a different coach and new quarterback. Nick Sirianni replaced Doug Pederson in 2021 and Hurts took over for Carson Wentz in late 2020.

            
                Hurts set a Super Bowl record with 70 yards rushing and tied a record with three rushing scores. He also threw for 304 yards and one TD.

            ""We use this pain, we use this failure to motivate us so we can make it a strength,” Sirianni said.

            Hurts, who missed two games late in the season with a shoulder injury, had TD runs of 1 and 4 yards in the first half along with a 45-yard TD pass to A.J. Brown.

            But Hurts also made a rare mistake when he fumbled without being hit while scrambling away from pressure. Nick Bolton picked it up and raced 36 yards for a score that made it 14-14. Hurts had just eight turnovers this season, six picks and two fumbles.

            Mahomes finished 21 of 27 for 182 yards with three TDs and no turnovers. He ran for 44 yards.

            Mahomes connected with Kelce on an 18-yard TD pass in the right corner to tie it at 7-7 in the first quarter. The Chiefs’ All-Pro tight end and Eagles All-Pro center Jason Kelce became the first set of brothers to play against each other in the Super Bowl.

            Their mom, Donna Kelce, wore a half-red, half-green jersey with No. 87 on the front for Travis and No. 62 on the back for Jason. She sat in a suite between NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and Damar Hamlin. 

            Eagles fans turned State Farm Stadium into a sea of green, chanting “E-A-G-L-E-S!” and singing the team’s fight song after each score. But they left disappointed.

            Reid won more games than any coach in team history during 14 seasons with the Eagles but the one knock against him was that he couldn’t win the big one. Reid finally earned his ring in his seventh season with the Chiefs. They went back the next year and lost to Tom Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. 

            Reid, who turns 65 next month, ended any speculation about his potential retirement.

            “If they’ll have me, I’ll stick around,” he said.

            The first Super Bowl involving both No. 1 seeds since the Eagles beat the Patriots 41-33 in February 2018 lived up to its hype. It was the third-highest scoring Super Bowl and the Eagles scored the most points by a losing team.

            AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFLGLENDALE, Ariz. (AP) — Patrick Mahomes was magical when the Kansas City Chiefs desperately needed him to pull off another Super Bowl comeback.Playing on an injured ankle, Mahomes threw two touchdown passes in the fourth quarter and scrambled 26 yards on the go-ahead drive before Harrison Butker kicked a 27-yard field goal with 8 seconds left to give the Chiefs a 38-35 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday night.The Chiefs won their second NFL title in four years and two-time NFL MVP Mahomes earned his second Super Bowl MVP award.“I thought guys just embraced the moment,” Mahomes said about rallying from a 10-point halftime deficit. “In that first half, we were playing and doing some good stuff, but I felt like the guys were getting consumed by everything around us.”Mahomes and Jalen Hurts excelled in the first Super Bowl matchup featuring two Black starting QBs. But Mahomes turned it up in the second half after reaggravating a sprained right ankle.“It took everybody to win the game,” Mahomes shouted as red and yellow confetti littered the field.Coach Andy Reid, who couldn’t win the big game in Philadelphia, beat his former team to earn his second ring with Mahomes and the Chiefs.“We wanted to get this so bad for him,” Travis Kelce said. “His legacy in Philly lives on forever. ... There’s a lot of pride in knowing that he’s had success in two different organizations, but this was the better one.”With the score tied at 35-35, the Eagles tried to let the Chiefs score a touchdown with under two minutes left so they could get the ball back after a defensive holding call on cornerback James Bradberry on third-and-8 gave Kansas City a first down. But Jerick McKinnon slid at the 2, forcing the Eagles to use their last timeout.“It was holding. I tugged his jersey. I was hoping they would let it slide,” Bradberry said.After Mahomes took a knee twice, Butker nailed his kick, sending thousands of red-clad Chiefs fans into a frenzy.“It feels amazing just to see the confetti,” said Butker, who missed a 42-yarder in the first quarter. “I just tried to focus on one kick and focusing on the process.”The Chiefs won their second Super Bowl following the 2019 season, 50 years after the first one. Mahomes led them back from a 10-point deficit in the fourth quarter against San Francisco in that one. It took just three years to get another Lombardi.Chiefs fans were outnumbered in the stadium, but did their part to silence the boisterous Philly fans with the tomahawk chop chant.Down 24-14 with a limping Mahomes, the Chiefs (17-3) followed up Rihanna’s electrifying halftime performance with a sensational offensive outburst.Mahomes, who suffered a high ankle sprain in the divisional round, hurt it again on a 3-yard scramble late in the second quarter. He limped off the field but showed no ill effects on Kansas City’s next possession.“I knew it was pretty bad when he got up limping but I knew it wasn’t gonna be bad enough to where he was gonna pull himself off the field,” Chiefs offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy said. “If we would’ve pulled him off, I would’ve had to fight him. He would’ve probably fought me. And so it wasn’t worth entertaining.”Mahomes slipped — several players lost their footing on the natural grass surface — in the pocket yet somehow regained his balance and scrambled 14 yards to the Eagles 4, setting up Isiah Pacheco’s 1-yard TD run that cut the deficit to 24-21.Mahomes then tossed a 5-yard TD pass to a wide-open Kadarius Toney to give Kansas City its first lead, 28-27, early in the fourth quarter.After the Chiefs tightened up their defense, forcing Philly to punt, Toney returned a line-drive kick 65 yards to the Eagles 5 for the longest punt return in Super Bowl history.On third down from the 4, Mahomes connected with Skyy Moore to extend their lead to 35-27. Moore also was wide open on the play.But the Eagles wouldn’t go away.Hurts hit DeVonta Smith for a 45-yard gain to the Chiefs 2 and ran in for his third score of the game. He also ran in for the 2-point conversion to tie it at 35-35 with 5:15 to go.As “Fly! Eagles! Fly!” reverberated throughout the stadium, Mahomes and the Chiefs went back to work.The 27-year-old Mahomes became the third player to win his second NFL MVP award before age 28. He also became the youngest QB to start three Super Bowls. Mahomes finally broke the MVP curse, becoming the first player to win the Super Bowl the same season after nine straight players lost.Just five years after winning the first Super Bowl in franchise history, the Eagles (16-4) came close with a different coach and new quarterback. Nick Sirianni replaced Doug Pederson in 2021 and Hurts took over for Carson Wentz in late 2020.Hurts set a Super Bowl record with 70 yards rushing and tied a record with three rushing scores. He also threw for 304 yards and one TD.""We use this pain, we use this failure to motivate us so we can make it a strength,” Sirianni said.Hurts, who missed two games late in the season with a shoulder injury, had TD runs of 1 and 4 yards in the first half along with a 45-yard TD pass to A.J. Brown.But Hurts also made a rare mistake when he fumbled without being hit while scrambling away from pressure. Nick Bolton picked it up and raced 36 yards for a score that made it 14-14. Hurts had just eight turnovers this season, six picks and two fumbles.Mahomes finished 21 of 27 for 182 yards with three TDs and no turnovers. He ran for 44 yards.Mahomes connected with Kelce on an 18-yard TD pass in the right corner to tie it at 7-7 in the first quarter.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808549,"U2 returning to stage in Las Vegas, minus one of quartet","NEW YORK (AP) — U2 is returning to the concert stage later this year for the first time since 2019 but without one of the original quartet, as drummer Larry Mullen Jr. is on the injured list.

            The band offered a hint about its reemergence on the biggest stage possible — in a commercial that aired during the Super Bowl on Sunday — and announced it would play a series of shows this fall to open the new MSG Sphere venue in Las Vegas.

            The concerts will be focused on the band's 1991 album, “Achtung Baby.”











            “We need to get back on stage and see the faces of our fans again,” band members Bono, the Edge and Adam Clayton said in a statement Sunday.

            No other dates were announced beyond Las Vegas, although it's unlikely a show will be built for just one city. In 2017 and 2019, the band did a worldwide concert tour based on its “Joshua Tree” album.

            Mullen is arguably the band's founder; the four members met in his Dublin kitchen to answer an ad he had placed on a high school bulletin board seeking musicians. U2 wouldn't detail his health concerns, but a report in The Washington Post in November said the drummer had issues with his neck and elbows that needed surgery.

            Only twice before has the band taken stage without all four members — when Clayton missed a gig in Australia for health reasons in 1993, and after Mullen broke his foot in a motorcycle accident in 1978, according to Bono's book, “Surrender.”

            Mullen will be replaced in Las Vegas by Dutch drummer Bram van den Berg.

            Next month U2 is planning to release the disc “Songs of Surrender,” featuring re-recorded and re-imagined versions of 40 songs from its catalog.

            The Edge said he was impressed by the state-of-the-art sound and video system being constructed for the MSG Sphere. “We all thought about it and decided we'd be mad not to accept the invitation,” he said.NEW YORK (AP) — U2 is returning to the concert stage later this year for the first time since 2019 but without one of the original quartet, as drummer Larry Mullen Jr. is on the injured list.The band offered a hint about its reemergence on the biggest stage possible — in a commercial that aired during the Super Bowl on Sunday — and announced it would play a series of shows this fall to open the new MSG Sphere venue in Las Vegas.The concerts will be focused on the band's 1991 album, “Achtung Baby.”“We need to get back on stage and see the faces of our fans again,” band members Bono, the Edge and Adam Clayton said in a statement Sunday.No other dates were announced beyond Las Vegas, although it's unlikely a show will be built for just one city.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808550,What's a catch? Super Bowl raises the question again,"GLENDALE, Ariz. (AP) — A catch or not a catch? That's still a good question.

            And it was asked a few more times during the Super Bowl between the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles.

            By the players and coaches — and millions more on social media and in front of their TVs at home.











            According to Rule 3, Section 2, Article 7 of the NFL Rulebook: “A catch is made when a player inbounds secures possession of a pass, kick, or fumble that is in flight.”

            But it was a bit more complicated than that on the NFL's biggest stage.

            In the third quarter on Kansas City's 38-35 victory Sunday, Philadelphia faced third-and-14 when Jalen Hurts found Dallas Goedert along the right sideline and the Eagles tight end caught the ball, bobbled it and caught it again while going out of bounds.

            The play was ruled a completion on the field and the Eagles raced to the line of scrimmage. But because the play ended on the sideline, play was ruled dead because Kansas City needed to have time to match Philadelphia's player substitutions. 

            That gave the Chiefs time to challenge the catch. But a video review confirmed Goedert had secured the ball before going out of bounds. 

            The Eagles were on the opposite end of that near the end of the first half when Hurts' deep pass to DeVonta Smith was ruled incomplete because he didn't control the ball as he made contact with the ground. 

            Smith had made an acrobatic grab, securing the ball against his helmet — but the ball moved slightly as he hit the ground. It was initially ruled a catch, but overturned on the review.

            “What’s a catch ? Lol,” former NFL defensive end and current ESPN analyst Marcus Spears wrote on Twitter, echoing the thoughts of many similarly confused viewers.

            “It is a catch, or an interception, if, in the process of attempting to possess the ball, a player secures control of the ball prior to it touching the ground,” the NFL Rulebook says, “and that control is maintained during and after the ball has touched the ground.”

            The whole catch-or-not debate came up again on Philadelphia's opening drive of the second half when Hurts threw a short pass to Miles Sanders — who was immediately walloped by L’Jarius Sneed. The ball came loose and Nick Bolton — who already returned a fumble for a touchdown earlier — picked up the ball and headed to the end zone again.

            The call on the field by officials was a touchdown by Bolton, but a review overturned the call with the play ruled an incomplete pass because Sanders never completed the reception.

            “It’s 2023 and we still don’t know what’s consider a catch,” veteran free agent cornerback Prince Amukamara tweeted. 

            And for some, it will simply remain one of life's mysteries.

            “What’s a catch? What’s a hold? What is love?” former soccer star and current TV analyst Alexi Lalas wrote on Twitter.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808566,Questionable late flag takes drama out of Super Bowl ending,"GLENDALE, Ariz. (AP) — A questionable late penalty on Philadelphia Eagles cornerback James Bradberry with less than two minutes remaining meant that a scintillating Super Bowl 57 had a bit of an underwhelming finish.

            Kansas City won its second Super Bowl in four years by beating the Eagles 38-35 on Sunday in Glendale, Arizona. It was an exciting back-and-forth game that saw the Chiefs claw back from a 10-point halftime deficit.

            One of the few gripes for football fans — particularly Eagles fans — was the anticlimactic ending.











            The Chiefs were driving and faced third-and-8 at the Eagles 15-yard line with 1:54 remaining when Kansas City quarterback Patrick Mahomes threw incomplete to JuJu Smith-Schuster. But officials flagged Bradberry for defensive holding, which negated the incompletion and, more importantly, gave the Chiefs a first down.

            Replays showed that Bradberry made light contact with Smith-Schuster, though it didn't appear to affect the play much. 

            Many fans — and some football commentators — disagreed with the call. Former NFL tight end Greg Olsen wasn't happy with the decision on the Fox broadcast and ESPN and Amazon analyst Kirk Herbstreit was also critical on social media.

            The only person who didn't seem upset with the call was Bradberry himself.

            “It was a holding. I tugged his jersey,"" Bradberry said. ""I was hoping they would let it slide.”

            Referee Carl Cheffers said it was a “clear case of a jersey grab.”

            “The receiver went to the inside and he was attempting to release to the outside,"" Cheffers told a pool reporter. ""The defender grabbed the jersey with his right hand and restricted him from releasing to the outside. So, therefore, we called defensive holding.”

            Kansas City was able to essentially run out the clock from that point forward. Chiefs running back Jerick McKinnon made a smart move on the ensuing down, purposefully sliding 2 yards short of the goal line instead of scoring a touchdown. 

            Mahomes then was able to kneel twice as the clock ran down after the Eagles used their final timeout. 

            Harrison Butker kicked a 27-yard field goal with 8 seconds remaining that proved to be the winner.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808567,Philippines says China ship used laser against coast guard,"MANILA, Philippines (AP) — The Philippines on Monday accused a Chinese coast guard ship of hitting a Philippine coast guard vessel with a military-grade laser and temporarily blinding some of its crew in the disputed South China Sea, calling it a “blatant” violation of Manila’s sovereign rights.

            The Chinese ship also maneuvered dangerously close, about 137 meters (449 feet), to block the Philippine patrol vessel BRP Malapascua from approaching Second Thomas Shoal, a submerged reef that has been occupied by Philippine forces, on Feb. 6, the Philippine coast guard said in a statement.

            The Philippines has filed nearly 200 diplomatic protests against China’s aggressive actions in the disputed waters in 2022 alone. 











            China claims the South China Sea virtually in its entirety, putting it on a collision course with other claimants. Despite friendly overtures to Beijing by former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte and his successor, Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who met Chinese leader Xi Jinping in January in Beijing, tensions have persisted, drawing in closer military alliance between the Philippines and the U.S. 

            Although the Chinese coast guard had tried to block Philippine coast guard ships in the disputed waters before, this was the first time it used lasers and caused physical suffering among Filipino personnel, Philippine coast guard spokesperson Commodore Armand Balilo told The Associated Press.

            “The Chinese ship illuminated the green laser light twice toward the BRP Malapascua, causing temporary blindness to her crew at the bridge,” the Philippine statement said.

            A video issued by the coast guard in Manila shows a Chinese coast guard ship cutting across the path of a Philippine vessel from a distance. A green laser-like light is later emitted by the Chinese ship.

            The Philippine military said it’s time for China to restrain its forces from committing “any provocative act that will endanger the lives of people.” Spokesman Col. Medel Aguilar told reporters that the Philippine defense chief deemed the Chinese coast guard’s action “offensive and unsafe.”

            In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said a Philippine coast guard vessel trespassed into Chinese waters without permission on Feb. 6. Chinese coast guard vessels responded “professionally and with restraint at the site in accordance with China’s law and international law,” he said, without elaborating and mentioning the use of laser.

            “We hope the Philippines will earnestly respect China’s territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests in the South China Sea and avoid any actions that may lead to the expansion of the dispute and complication of the situation,” Wang said in reply to a question at a daily media briefing. “China and the Philippines are maintaining communication through diplomatic channels in this regard.""

            The Philippine vessel was forced to move away from the area, where it was escorting a supply vessel that was delivering food and sailors to a Philippine navy sentry ship, the BRP Sierra Madre, which has been marooned on Second Thomas Shoal since 1999, the coast guard said. 

            “The deliberate blocking of the Philippine government ships to deliver food and supplies to our military personnel on board the BRP Sierra Madre is a blatant disregard for, and a clear violation of, Philippine sovereign rights in this part of the West Philippine Sea,” the coast guard said, using the name the Philippines has adopted for the stretch of waters close to its western coast.

            It was not immediately clear if the Philippine resupply mission pushed through despite the incident. 

            The Chinese coast guard also blocked Philippine ships escorting a supply vessel from approaching Second Thomas Shoal in August, the coast guard said. At the time, one of the two Chinese ships that were joined by two Chinese civilian vessels removed the cover of its 70mm armament, the coast guard said, adding it would not be deterred by China’s aggression in protecting Philippine sovereignty in the disputed sea.

            Aside from China and the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Taiwan and Brunei also have overlapping claims in the resource-rich and busy waterway, where a bulk of the world’s commerce and oil transits.

            The United States lays no claims to the disputed sea but has deployed forces to patrol the waters to promote freedom of navigation and overflight — moves that have angered Beijing, which has warned Washington to stop meddling in what it says is a purely Asian dispute. 

            The U.S. Navy and Marine Corps held joint exercises in the South China Sea over the weekend at a time of heightened tensions with Beijing over the shooting down of a suspected Chinese spy balloon. The U.S. has been taking steps to rebuild its military might in the Philippines more than 30 years after the closure of its large bases in the country and reinforcing an arc of military alliances in Asia.MANILA, Philippines (AP) — The Philippines on Monday accused a Chinese coast guard ship of hitting a Philippine coast guard vessel with a military-grade laser and temporarily blinding some of its crew in the disputed South China Sea, calling it a “blatant” violation of Manila’s sovereign rights.The Chinese ship also maneuvered dangerously close, about 137 meters (449 feet), to block the Philippine patrol vessel BRP Malapascua from approaching Second Thomas Shoal, a submerged reef that has been occupied by Philippine forces, on Feb. 6, the Philippine coast guard said in a statement.The Philippines has filed nearly 200 diplomatic protests against China’s aggressive actions in the disputed waters in 2022 alone.China claims the South China Sea virtually in its entirety, putting it on a collision course with other claimants.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808568,Asian stocks slide ahead of US inflation update,"BEIJING (AP) — Asian stock markets sank Monday ahead of a U.S. inflation update that traders worry might lead to more interest rate hikes.

            Tokyo, Hong Kong and Seoul declined. Shanghai advanced. Oil prices declined.

            Traders hope Tuesday's inflation data will show upward pressure on U.S. prices is easing, which might encourage the Federal Reserve to ease off efforts to cool business activity and hiring. They worry a strong reading after estimates of 2022 inflation were revised up last week would reinforce plans to keep rates high and possibly increase them.











            A strong inflation figure “can move through risk assets like a wrecking ball,” Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a report.

            The Nikkei 225 in Tokyo sank 1.1% to 27,354.81 while the Shanghai Composite Index advanced 0.5% to 3,276.39. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong lost 0.6% to 21,060.77.

            The Kospi in Seoul declined 0.9% to 2,447.77 and Sydney's S&P-ASX 200 shed 0.3% to 7,410.30. New Zealand and Singapore retreated while Jakarta gained.

            On Friday, Wall Street's benchmark S&P 500 index rose 0.2% to 4,090.46. The index ended the week with a loss of 1.1%, its biggest weekly decline since December.

            The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.5% to 33,869.27. The Nasdaq fell less than 0.1% to 11,718.12.

            Stocks have been rallying since last month on hopes the Fed might start cutting rates as early as late this year. That is despite warnings by Chair Jerome Powell that rates will stay elevated for an extended period until inflation pressures are extinguished.

            Other central banks in Europe and Asia also have raised rates to cool inflation.

            Wall Street raised its forecast of how high the Fed might raise rates after Powell said last week there is a “significant road ahead” to get inflation down to its 2% target. He warned against expecting inflation to “go away quickly and painlessly.”

            The U.S. government revised December inflation to 0.1% over the previous month, up from the earlier estimate of a 0.1% decline. The November figure was raised to 0.2% over the previous month from 0.1%.

            Traders expect Tuesday's report to say consumer prices rose 0.5% in January over the previous month.

            The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond, or the difference between the market price and the payout at maturity, widened to 3.73% on Friday from 3.66%. 

            The yield on the two-year Treasury ticked up to 4.50% from 4.48%. It was at 4.08% just over a week ago and is near its highest level since November.

            Equities analysts have cut forecasts of first-quarter earnings for companies in the S&P 500 by 4.5% due to the impact of inflation and slowing economic activity, according to strategists at Credit Suisse.

            News Corp. fell 9.4% after the owner of The Wall Street Journal and other media reported weaker quarterly results than expected. Expedia lost 8.6% after reporting weaker profit and revenue for the latest quarter than expected.

            Oil prices fell back following a surge Friday after Russia said it would cut production by 500,000 barrels per day next month. Western countries have imposed an upper limit on how much they will allow customers to pay for Russian crude to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine. 

            In energy markets, benchmark U.S. crude lost 75 cents to $78.97 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract rose $1.66 to $79.72 on Friday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808587,Chiefs' Travis Kelce tops big brother on Super Bowl stage,"GLENDALE, Ariz. (AP) — Travis Kelce finished off what he called the best year of his life with a second Super Bowl title.

            This one came at the expense of his big brother.

            The Chiefs tight end hauled in six catches for a team-leading 81 yards and a touchdown Sunday night, helping Kansas City rally from a 10-point halftime hole to beat Jason Kelce and the Philadelphia Eagles 38-35 at State Farm Stadium.











            “I got closer to my brother. Got to meet him at the mountaintop,"" the younger Kelce said. ""Best feeling in the world.""

            Travis Kelce got emotional when he began talking about his mother, Donna Kelce, who became a star in her own right during Super Bowl week. She was featured during pregame wearing a custom outfit that was half Chiefs and half Eagles, along with a pair of shoes with Jason Kelce's number on the right and Travis Kelce's number on the left, earrings representing each team and a tote bag that had both her sons' numbers and “Mama Kelce” on it.

            She was clearly playing no favorites on Sunday night.

            There could be only one winner, though.

            Jason Kelce did all he could to help the Eagles add another Lombardi Trophy to the one he won in 2018. The burly center paved the way for Jalen Hurts to throw for 304 yards and a touchdown while running for 70 yards and three more scores, and he helped the Eagles drive downfield in the fourth quarter for a tying touchdown and 2-point conversion.

            The Chiefs still had time in a 35-all game for his All-Pro little brother and Patrick Mahomes to go to work.

            With about three minutes to go, the two connected for a nice completion early in the drive, helping Kansas City into rhythm as it drove for a go-ahead score. The Chiefs eventually moved near the Philadelphia goal line, aided by a questionable penalty for defensive holding, before Harrison Butker drilled a 27-yard field goal with 8 seconds to go.

            The Eagles threw incomplete on the game's final play as Travis Kelce and the Chiefs raced off the sideline to celebrate.

            Then, old No. 87 tried to find his big brother amid the showering confetti.

            “In a situation like that, there’s not a lot you can say to a loved one,” Travis Kelce said, tearing up. “You joke around all the time and say that you want to beat your brother on the biggest stage ever, but it’s a weird feeling.

            “There’s nothing really I could say to him, other than I love him and he played a hell of a year, a hell of a season.”

            In early 2016, the then-South Carolina governor said she was “embarrassed” by candidate Donald Trump and decried his reluctance to condemn white supremacists. Nine months later, she agreed to join his Cabinet, serving as a key validator as Trump sought to win over skeptical world leaders and voters at home.

            And shortly after Trump left the White House, Haley, whose resume by then included an ambassadorship to the United Nations, vowed not to step in the way if he ran for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination. Yet on Wednesday, she is poised to become the first major Republican candidate to enter the race against him.











            “It’s going to be quite the high-wire act,” said veteran Republican strategist Terry Sullivan. “She says she’s always been an underdog. She will be again.""

            The 51-year-old Haley may be the first to take on Trump, but a half-dozen or more high-profile Republicans are expected to join the GOP's 2024 presidential nomination contest over the coming months. Some would-be competitors may be more popular than Haley even in South Carolina, where she lives and has established a campaign headquarters. 

            Likely rivals include Sen. Tim Scott, a fellow South Carolinian and perhaps the most celebrated elected official in a state where Trump has already locked up endorsements from the governor and its senior senator, Lindsey Graham. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former Vice President Mike Pence could also be formidable foes should they run, as widely expected.

            Indeed, on the eve of this week's announcement, there is broad agreement that Haley — the only Republican woman of color expected in the 2024 contest, a politician who loves to remind people that she has never lost an election — is about to be tested as never before. Trump, for instance, has already stepped up his attacks on Haley.

            But allies describe the former governor, who is the daughter of Indian immigrants, as a savvy executive uniquely positioned to lead a new generation of Republicans. They understand that the fight ahead could get ugly. 

            “She took the bull by the horns and said, ‘That doesn’t matter to me, I’m going to run,'"" said longtime supporter Gavin J. Smith. ""She did that when she ran for governor, and that’s what you’re going to see when she runs for president.”

            Perhaps more than anyone this young presidential primary season, Haley personifies the Republican Party's shifting views on Trump. Her reversal on whether to challenge the former president was based less on concerns about his divisive leadership or policy disagreements than the growing belief within the GOP that Trump is losing political strength.

            New York-based Republican donor Eric Levine says he's convinced that another Trump Republican nomination would lead to his party's destruction. Haley, he said, is among the three favorite Trump alternatives. 

            “I think as a woman of color and a daughter of legal immigrants from India, she'd give the Democratic Party no reason to exist. All their woke crap goes out the window,” Levine said. “I think she's a spectacular candidate.” 

            Haley's announcement will take place Wednesday in Charleston, the historic coastal city where her campaign will be based. Almost immediately, she'll travel to meet voters in New Hampshire and Iowa.

            She's entrusted her campaign to a collection of senior staff led by longtime aides. Betsy Ankney, who heads up Haley's PAC, will manage the campaign, with the PAC's development director, Mary Kate Johnson, as finance director, Haley’s team told The Associated Press. 

            Longtime Haley adviser Chaney Denton and Nachama Soloveichik, who was a spokeswoman for recently retired Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey, will head up communications. Strategist Jon Lerner will serve as senior adviser, and Barney Keller of Jamestown Associates will be Haley's media consultant.

            For Haley, this week's launch marks a significant step on a long road that began in South Carolina's “Good Old Boys Club,” she wrote in a Friday fundraising appeal. 

            “People thought I was too brown … too female … too young … too conservative … too principled,” she wrote.

            Born in 1972 in rural South Carolina, Haley has long spoken of a Southern rural childhood in which she felt she didn't fit. She was raised in the Sikh faith with a mother who wore traditional saris, and a father clad in a turban.

            “Nikki has been regularly underestimated,” said Catherine Templeton, a Republican who served Haley in two roles, leading South Carolina’s labor and public health agencies. “But it makes her work harder.”

            In her first campaign in 2004, Haley, formerly an accountant, defeated the longest-serving member of South Carolina’s House. After six years in the Legislature, she was considered a longshot when she mounted her 2010 gubernatorial campaign. 

            The GOP field was filled with more experienced politicians, and at times, she faced blatant racism. Then-state Sen. Jake Knotts appeared on a talk show and used a racial slur in reference to Haley. He apologized, saying it was meant as a joke. 

            Still, Haley became the first woman and person of color elected South Carolina’s governor — and the nation’s youngest state executive. After winning reelection in 2014, her second term was marred by crisis.

            She spent weeks attending funerals of Black parishioners gunned down by a self-avowed white supremacist at a Charleston church in 2015. Later that year, she pushed for and signed legislation to remove the Confederate flag from the Statehouse grounds, where it had flown for more than 50 years. 

            Haley's political skills were tested in a different way in 2016, as Trump went from late-night television punchline to serious Republican presidential contender. 

            She endorsed Florida Sen. Marco Rubio ahead of South Carolina's high-stakes Republican primary, then backed Texas Sen. Ted Cruz once Rubio was knocked out.

            Then, Haley described Trump as “everything a governor doesn't want in a president."" She also said she was “embarrassed” by his attacks against former President George W. Bush and condemned Trump's reluctance to disavow the KKK.

            But shortly after Trump won the presidency, she agreed to serve as the new administration's ambassador to the United Nations, a Cabinet-level position. 

            “I proudly serve in this administration, and I enthusiastically support most of its decisions and the direction it is taking the country,"" Haley said in a 2018 op-ed.

            Later that year, Haley abruptly announced her departure from the U.N. in the wake of an ethics probe, fueling speculation that she might challenge Trump in 2020 or replace Pence on the ticket. Neither happened.

            Instead, Haley returned to South Carolina, joined the board of aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and hit the lucrative speaking circuit, reportedly commanding fees as high as $200,000. She also penned two books.

            Her public support for Trump continued even after the attack on the Capitol.

            “I’m really proud of the successes of the Trump administration. Whether it was foreign policy or domestic policy, we should embrace those,"" she tweeted three weeks after the insurrection. 

            It's unclear whether such platitudes will give Haley much cushion in a party that, for now, remains dominated by Trump and his supporters. Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York, the No. 3 House Republican, has already endorsed Trump's 2024 bid. While she declined to comment directly on Haley's candidacy, she insisted that Trump would defeat any Republican challenger ""by massive margins.” 

            “It is time for Republicans to unite around the most popular Republican in America,” she said of Trump.

            Rob Godfrey, a longtime Haley adviser who served for a time as her chief spokesman, said his former boss should be prepared to go on offense during what is sure to be a tumultuous campaign. 

            “She should approach this campaign as she has approached any other - disciplined, ignoring distractions, and ready to land a hard counter punch or two,"" he said. ""When you are running against a chaos candidate, which she is until someone else jumps in, you never know what is around the corner.”CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) — Few have navigated the turbulent politics of the Trump era like Nikki Haley.In early 2016, the then-South Carolina governor said she was “embarrassed” by candidate Donald Trump and decried his reluctance to condemn white supremacists. Nine months later, she agreed to join his Cabinet, serving as a key validator as Trump sought to win over skeptical world leaders and voters at home.And shortly after Trump left the White House, Haley, whose resume by then included an ambassadorship to the United Nations, vowed not to step in the way if he ran for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808589,Google to expand misinformation 'prebunking' in Europe,"WASHINGTON (AP) — After seeing promising results in Eastern Europe, Google will initiate a new campaign in Germany that aims to make people more resilient to the corrosive effects of online misinformation.

            The tech giant plans to release a series of short videos highlighting the techniques common to many misleading claims. The videos will appear as advertisements on platforms like Facebook, YouTube or TikTok in Germany. A similar campaign in India is also in the works.

            It's an approach called prebunking, which involves teaching people how to spot false claims before they encounter them. The strategy is gaining support among researchers and tech companies.











            “There's a real appetite for solutions,” said Beth Goldberg, head of research and development at Jigsaw, an incubator division of Google that studies emerging social challenges. “Using ads as a vehicle to counter a disinformation technique is pretty novel. And we're excited about the results.”

            While belief in falsehoods and conspiracy theories isn't new, the speed and reach of the internet has given them a heightened power. When catalyzed by algorithms, misleading claims can discourage people from getting vaccines, spread authoritarian propaganda, foment distrust in democratic institutions and spur violence.

            It's a challenge with few easy solutions. Journalistic fact checks are effective, but they're labor intensive, aren't read by everyone, and won't convince those already distrustful of traditional journalism. Content moderation by tech companies is another response, but it only drives misinformation elsewhere, while prompting cries of censorship and bias.

            Prebunking videos, by contrast, are relatively cheap and easy to produce and can be seen by millions when placed on popular platforms. They also avoid the political challenge altogether by focusing not on the topics of false claims, which are often cultural lightning rods, but on the techniques that make viral misinformation so infectious.

            Those techniques include fear-mongering, scapegoating, false comparisons, exaggeration and missing context. Whether the subject is COVID-19, mass shootings, immigration, climate change or elections, misleading claims often rely on one or more of these tricks to exploit emotions and short-circuit critical thinking.

            Last fall, Google launched the largest test of the theory so far with a prebunking video campaign in Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The videos dissected different techniques seen in false claims about Ukrainian refugees. Many of those claims relied on alarming and unfounded stories about refugees committing crimes or taking jobs away from residents.

            The videos were seen 38 million times on Facebook, TikTok, YouTube and Twitter — a number that equates to a majority of the population in the three nations. Researchers found that compared to people who hadn't seen the videos, those who did watch were more likely to be able to identify misinformation techniques, and less likely to spread false claims to others.

            The pilot project was the largest test of prebunking so far and adds to a growing consensus in support of the theory.

            “This is a good news story in what has essentially been a bad news business when it comes to misinformation,” said Alex Mahadevan, director of MediaWise, a media literacy initiative of the Poynter Institute that has incorporated prebunking into its own programs in countries including Brazil, Spain, France and the U.S.

            Mahadevan called the strategy a “pretty efficient way to address misinformation at scale, because you can reach a lot of people while at the same time address a wide range of misinformation.”

            Google's new campaign in Germany will include a focus on photos and videos, and the ease with which they can be presented of evidence of something false. One example: Last week, following the earthquake in Turkey, some social media users shared video of the massive explosion in Beirut in 2020, claiming it was actually footage of a nuclear explosion triggered by the earthquake. It was not the first time the 2020 explosion had been the subject of misinformation.

            Google will announce its new German campaign Monday ahead of next week's Munich Security Conference. The timing of the announcement, coming before that annual gathering of international security officials, reflects heightened concerns about the impact of misinformation among both tech companies and government officials.

            Tech companies like prebunking because it avoids touchy topics that are easily politicized, said Sander van der Linden, a University of Cambridge professor considered a leading expert on the theory. Van der Linden worked with Google on its campaign and is now advising Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, as well.

            Meta has incorporated prebunking into many different media literacy and anti-misinformation campaigns in recent years, the company told The Associated Press in an emailed statement.

            They include a 2021 program in the U.S. that offered media literacy training about COVID-19 to Black, Latino and Asian American communities. Participants who took the training were later tested and found to be far more resistant to misleading COVID-19 claims.

            Prebunking comes with its own challenges. The effects of the videos eventually wears off, requiring the use of periodic “booster” videos. Also, the videos must be crafted well enough to hold the viewer's attention, and tailored for different languages, cultures and demographics. And like a vaccine, it's not 100% effective for everyone.

            Google found that its campaign in Eastern Europe varied from country to country. While the effect of the videos was highest in Poland, in Slovakia they had “little to no discernible effect,” researchers found. One possible explanation: The videos were dubbed into the Slovak language, and not created specifically for the local audience.

            But together with traditional journalism, content moderation and other methods of combating misinformation, prebunking could help communities reach a kind of herd immunity when it comes to misinformation, limiting its spread and impact.

            “You can think of misinformation as a virus. It spreads. It lingers. It can make people act in certain ways,"" Van der Linden told the AP. ""Some people develop symptoms, some do not. So: if it spreads and acts like a virus, then maybe we can figure out how to inoculate people.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808604,Asian shares mostly rise ahead of key US inflation report,"TOKYO (AP) — Asian shares mostly rose Tuesday, boosted by a rally on Wall Street, as investors waited for U.S. consumer price data due out later in the day. 

            “Sentiments are largely tracking the positive handover from Wall Street overnight, although much is still up in the air,” Yeap Jun Rong, a market analyst at IG, said in a commentary. 

            In a mixed sign of Japan's shaky recovery, government data showed the world's third largest economy grew at an annual pace of 0.6% in October-December, as restrictions related to the coronavirus pandemic eased, both abroad and in Japan. Tourism recovered, as did local travel, and exports grew, the Cabinet Office reported. 











            Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 gained 0.6% in morning trading to 27,579.73. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 edged up 0.2% to 7,435.90. South Korea's Kospi added 0.8% to 2,471.38. Hong Kong's Hang Seng lost 0.4% to 21,083.61, while the Shanghai Composite was virtually unchanged at 3,282.36. 

            Shares rose on Wall Street as traders made their final moves ahead of a report that could show whether inflation is cooling in the right way or setting the market up for worse pain. The S&P 500 climbed 1.1% in anticipation of Tuesday’s report on inflation at the consumer level across the country. 

            The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.1% to 34,245.93, while the Nasdaq composite rose 1.5% to 11,891.79. The S&P 500 rose 46.83 points to 4,137.29.

            Stocks were coming off their worst week in nearly two months, the latest stumble for a market that has struggled for more than a year on worries about high inflation. 

            The Federal Reserve has aggressively hiked rates to their highest level since 2007 to drive down the worst inflation in generations. High rates can stamp out inflation, but they do so at the risk of sending the economy into a recession and they drag prices for some investments.

            Economists expect Tuesday’s report to show inflation slowed to 6.2% in January. That would be down from 6.5% a month before and from a peak of more than 9% in the summer. Perhaps more important than the overall number is what the data show specifically about prices for services outside of housing, such as haircuts or airfares. Inflation has remained stubbornly high there, when it’s started to come down in other areas.

            Everyone agrees that inflation is heading in the right direction. The question is how quickly and steadily it will come down to the Fed's target of 2%. The central bank has been consistently saying it plans to keep rates higher for longer to ensure the job is done on inflation. 

            Yields were mixed Monday ahead of the inflation report. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which helps set rates for mortgages and other important loans, dipped to 3.70% from 3.75% late Friday. The two-year yield, which tends to move more on expectations for the Fed, was at 4.54% and close to its highest since November.

            All the worries about inflation and rates are happening against the backdrop of a decidedly lackluster earnings reporting season. Companies in the S&P 500 are on track to report a nearly 5% drop in earnings for the final three months of 2022, compared with a year earlier, according to FactSet.

            By the count of strategists at Credit Suisse, this is shaping up to be the worst earnings reporting season outside of a recession in 24 years.

            Pessimism is also building about earnings for the first three months of 2023. 

            A continued decline in corporate earnings is one reason strategists at Morgan Stanley are cautious about the rally stocks have made since the start of the year, even if they gave back some of it last week. The S&P 500 is up 7.8% for 2023 so far, though it remains stuck in its ""bear market” after falling more than 20% from its high last year. 

            “Price action is not reflective of the deteriorating fundamentals or the fact that the Fed is hiking during an earnings recession — drivers that should ultimately determine the lows for this bear market later this spring,” the strategists led by Michael Wilson wrote in a report. “Risk-reward is as poor as it’s been in our view.”

            The bulk of earnings reports have already come in for this season, with big utility companies and retailers among the companies toward the tail end. This week will include reports from Southern Co., Coca-Cola and Kraft Heinz. 

            In energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude fell $1.03 to $79.11 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the international pricing standard, fell 81 cents to $95.80 a barrel. 

            In currency trading, the U.S. dollar inched down to 132.07 Japanese yen from 132.42 yen. The euro cost $1.0736, up from $1.0726.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808605,Chiefs' Kadarius Toney makes most of his Super Bowl touches,"GLENDALE, Ariz. (AP) — Kadarius Toney's struggles with injuries and inconsistency prompted the New York Giants to give up on him midway through his second NFL season.

            The Kansas City Chiefs gave him a second chance and the talented receiver proved he's no first-round bust.

            A small part of Kansas City's offensive game plan, Toney made history and two of the biggest plays in the Chiefs' 38-35 Super Bowl win over the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday night.











            “It is the biggest game of my life,” Toney said. “It was, for real.”

            Hobbled by a sprained ankle that knocked him out of the AFC championship game, Toney took advantage of the two-week break before the Super Bowl. He received treatment the first week, returned to practice Monday in the desert and made the most of his limited touches in the Super Bowl.

            Toney wasn't a big part of Kansas City's offense through the first three quarters as the teams traded touchdowns and big plays. In fact, he played no part, at least beyond blocking and running safeties off other routes.

            
                Patrick Mahomes, himself hobbled by a sprained ankle, did not target Toney once, opting to go in the direction of Travis Kelce, JuJu Smith-Schuster and his running backs.

            Once Mahomes did look his way, Toney made a massive impact, catching a 5-yard touchdown after the Eagles left him wide open that gave the Chiefs a 28-27 lead early in the fourth quarter.

            “We saw something a little bit different on tape and we knew that we could take advantage of what they weren’t doing,” Chiefs offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy said. ""And Kadarius just did a hell of a job of finding a way to get himself open.”

            On Toney's next touch — also his last — he ran all the way into the record book.

            Kansas City's defense held, forcing the Eagles to punt. Toney caught Arryn Siposs' line-drive punt at the Chiefs' 30-yard, started to the left, then juked his way out of a tackle before reversing course. Picking up a wall of blockers, Toney raced down the right sideline before the Chiefs finally closed in on him at Philadelphia's 5-yard line. 

            The 65-yard punt return, longest in Super Bowl history, set up Mahomes' 4-yard TD pass to Skyy Moore that gave Kansas City a 35-28 lead.

            “I saw a lot of white jerseys in front of me,"" Toney said. ""At that moment, I was really excited to get the ball.”

            Toney had been waiting for this moment since the Giants used the 20th overall pick to draft him out of Florida in 2021.

            The 6-foot, 193-pound receiver had a breakout season with the Gators as a senior, finishing with 70 catches for 984 yards and a touchdowns. Once with New York, Toney suffered through multiple injuries. He played in 12 of 24 games for the Giants, totaling 41 catches for 420 yards.

            Toney was traded to Kansas City on Oct. 27 for third- and sixth-round draft picks. He caught two touchdown passes for the Chiefs, but again struggled to stay healthy. Toney was limited to one catch for 9 yards before hurting his ankle against the Cincinnati Bengals in the AFC title game. 

            He recovered in time to make two of the biggest plays in the biggest game of his life.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808606,Jalen Hurts' brilliant Super Bowl effort falls short,"GLENDALE, Ariz. (AP) — Whether it was through the air or on the ground, Jalen Hurts dominated the Super Bowl offensively for the Philadelphia Eagles.

            It just wasn't enough to outduel Patrick Mahomes.

            Hurts delivered a record performance on football's biggest stage, throwing for 304 yards and a touchdown, running for 70 yards and three scores and adding a game-tying 2-point conversion.











            But Hurts could only watch from the sideline as Mahomes drove the Chiefs to the go-ahead field goal with 8 seconds remaining for a 38-35 victory on Sunday.

            “It’s tough,” Hurts said. “We worked really hard to have this opportunity and to come up short it's tough. There’s always a lot to learn from, to have an opportunity to reflect on some of the things we didn’t do and could have done. There is a lot to learn from tonight.”

            Despite ending up with the loss, Hurts put together one of the most prolific games in Super Bowl history, but became the first QB ever to lose the big game while leading his team to at least 35 points.

            He set the record for most yards rushing ever by a quarterback in a Super Bowl, he tied Terrell Davis' record for most TD runs by any player, tied James White's mark with 20 points scored and joined Hall of Famers Steve Young and Joe Montana as the only players ever to account for at least 370 yards and four TDs (rushing and passing) in a Super Bowl.

            “Jalen played the best game I’ve seen him play and in the two years we’ve been together,"" coach Nick Sirianni said. “He was outstanding. I really thought he was in complete control and he did things with his legs in the run game, he did things with his arm in the pass game, made some unbelievable throws, unbelievable reads. I thought he played outstanding.”

            But the breakthrough season that ended with Hurts as the runner-up to Mahomes in the MVP voting also led him to be runner-up in the Super Bowl as Hurts became the first player to lose a Super Bowl despite accounting for four touchdowns.

            Hurts started the game fast and never slowed down — but couldn't get a chance to win it at the end thanks to a defensive holding call against James Bradberry that gave the Chiefs a first down in field-goal range and helped them run out almost the entire clock.

            Hurts had one last chance and his desperation pass fell way short and he waked off the field in dejection.

            It was a crushing way to end a brilliant performance.

            “Jalen played a hell of a game,” center Jason Kelce said. “On ground through the air. He made obviously some huge throws. Both offenses came ready to go. It was kind of one of those things where probably whoever had the ball last was going to be in a good situation. We knew if we gave it back with five minutes (remaining), you’re hoping somebody makes a play. But that’s a tough task. Patrick Mahomes is MVP for a reason.”

            Hurts scored on one of his patented sneaks on the opening drive, delivered a 45-yard scoring strike to A.J. Brown on the first play of the second quarter, added a 4-yard run late in the second quarter and then engineered a signature drive in the fourth quarter.

            He connected on a 45-yard pass to DeVonta Smith and then capped off the drive with a 2-yard run. He then ran it in himself for the game-tying 2-point conversion but was mostly a spectator after that. 

            “That was a special performance that I don’t want to get lost because of the loss they had,” Mahomes said.

            About the only thing Hurts didn't do right came when he fumbled while switching hands holding the ball, leading to a 36-yard fumble return TD for Nick Bolton in the first half.

            “I touch the ball every play so obviously you want to protect it,” Hurts said. “It hurt us. You never know what play it will be, but it hurt us.”

            But that one mistake did little to slow down Hurts, who converted a 28-yard run on a fourth-down keeper on the next drive to set up his second TD run of the game from 4 yards.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808607,"Rally by Mahomes, Chiefs fuels comeback for sportsbooks","LAS VEGAS (AP) — When Patrick Mahomes rallied the Kansas City Chiefs to a Super Bowl victory, he also led a comeback for the sportsbooks.

            
                Kansas City's 38-35 win over Philadelphia on Sunday night meant the books were winners on the betting line, which generally favored the Eagles by 1 1/2 points and drew plenty of wagering on the NFC champions. That victory by the sportsbooks offset a loss on the total, which was 51 1/2 points at many places that were hit hard by bets on the over.

            “Best case was Chiefs and under,” Chuck Esposito, sportsbook director for Red Rock Resort in Las Vegas, said in a text message.











            Jason Scott, BetMGM vice president of trading, expects the national handle on the Super Bowl to set a record simply because sports betting is legal in many more states. Jay Kornegay, vice president of race and sports operations at Westgate Las Vegas, expects the handle to be the highest, but probably will come in below expectations.

            When it comes to the Super Bowl, expectations are relative because the sportsbooks know there will be a massive amount of money bet regardless.

            
                Caesars Sportsbook tweeted that it took $2.2 million in New York on the Eagles to cover the 1 1/2-point spread. The bettor probably had a good feeling when Philadelphia led 24-14 at halftime.

            The feeling was not so good at the books, which was envisioning the double whammy of an Eagles win and the total going over. Mahomes limping into halftime on an injured ankle didn't exactly ease those concerns.

            “We weren't too thrilled at the break,” Kornegay said.

            At that point, he added, betting favorite Travis Kelce was delivering on the wagers. The Chiefs tight end had three catches for 60 yards at halftime, and his touchdown paid off on a plus-230 proposition bet, meaning a $100 wager would be worth $230.

            “It looked like he was going to have 15 catches in the game,” Kornegay said. “I've got to give credit to Coach (Andy) Reid and Mahomes for making that type of comeback and scoring that many points in the second half without involving Kelce. Kelce really disappeared in the second half. I mean, most people in this room couldn’t name two receivers for Kansas City.”

            Kelce caught three passes in the second half for 21 yards.

            The public won on the props at different books that paid off on the Eagles' successful 2-point conversion and the Chiefs' defensive score. Esposito said, however, enough of the props bets went Red Rock's way to make his casino a “small winner” in that area.

            Kornegay and Scott said their lines remained at 1 1/2 because there wasn't a surge on Chiefs betting to move the line at their sportsbooks. That wasn't the case at Circa Sports in Las Vegas. It closed at Philadelphia at minus-1, according to Circa sports marketing manager Aaron Oster.

            The sportsbooks, however, couldn't make the total high enough, and it was clear early this game had the makings of an offensive slugfest.

            “The totals market will actually be the most money we've ever lost on one market,” Scott said.

            If not for the rally by Mahomes and the Chiefs, BetMGM and many other books would have had a much tougher day. Mahomes was named the regular-season and Super Bowl MVP, and he was especially valuable to the books.

            “Was a very nice day,” Scott said. “Patrick Mahomes saved us.”

            This year's Super Bowl was the first played in a stadium with a sportsbook inside the venue.

            Next year's big game will be in Las Vegas.

            “We are going to be the football capitol of the world next year,” Kornegay said. “There are so many venues outside of Allegiant (Stadium) that fans can enjoy. I don’t know any other city that has that many hotel rooms and all these different venues of where they can enjoy the game. 

            ""So I suspect that we’re going to see record numbers across the board come next February.”

The bettor probably had a good feeling when Philadelphia led 24-14 at halftime.The feeling was not so good at the books, which was envisioning the double whammy of an Eagles win and the total going over. Mahomes limping into halftime on an injured ankle didn't exactly ease those concerns.“We weren't too thrilled at the break,” Kornegay said.At that point, he added, betting favorite Travis Kelce was delivering on the wagers. The Chiefs tight end had three catches for 60 yards at halftime, and his touchdown paid off on a plus-230 proposition bet, meaning a $100 wager would be worth $230.“It looked like he was going to have 15 catches in the game,” Kornegay said. “I've got to give credit to Coach (Andy) Reid and Mahomes for making that type of comeback and scoring that many points in the second half without involving Kelce. Kelce really disappeared in the second half. I mean, most people in this room couldn’t name two receivers for Kansas City.”Kelce caught three passes in the second half for 21 yards.The public won on the props at different books that paid off on the Eagles' successful 2-point conversion and the Chiefs' defensive score. Esposito said, however, enough of the props bets went Red Rock's way to make his casino a “small winner” in that area.Kornegay and Scott said their lines remained at 1 1/2 because there wasn't a surge on Chiefs betting to move the line at their sportsbooks. That wasn't the case at Circa Sports in Las Vegas. It closed at Philadelphia at minus-1, according to Circa sports marketing manager Aaron Oster.The sportsbooks, however, couldn't make the total high enough, and it was clear early this game had the makings of an offensive slugfest.“The totals market will actually be the most money we've ever lost on one market,” Scott said.If not for the rally by Mahomes and the Chiefs, BetMGM and many other books would have had a much tougher day. Mahomes was named the regular-season and Super Bowl MVP, and he was especially valuable to the books.“Was a very nice day,” Scott said. “Patrick Mahomes saved us.”This year's Super Bowl was the first played in a stadium with a sportsbook inside the venue.Next year's big game will be in Las Vegas.“We are going to be the football capitol of the world next year,” Kornegay said. “There are so many venues outside of Allegiant (Stadium) that fans can enjoy. I don’t know any other city that has that many hotel rooms and all these different venues of where they can enjoy the game.""So I suspect that we’re going to see record numbers across the board come next February.”___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/02/14,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808638,Death penalty phase begins in trial of NYC bike path killer,"NEW YORK (AP) — Jurors began hearing testimony Monday to help them decide whether an Islamic extremist who killed eight people on a New York City bike path should get a death sentence, an extraordinarily rare penalty in a state that hasn't had an execution in 60 years.

            
                Sayfullo Saipov, 35, was convicted last month in the attack. He intentionally drove a truck at high speed down a path along the Hudson River in 2017, running over bicyclists on a sunny morning just hours before the city's Halloween celebrations.

            The same jurors who found Saipov guilty returned to work after a two-week break to hear from additional witnesses in the trial's penalty phase. Anything less than a unanimous vote for death will mean Saipov will spend the rest of his life in prison.











            Assistant U.S. Attorney Amanda Houle said Saipov remains proud, defiant and unrepentant for the lives he ruined and that he remains dangerous, even behind bars. She said he once smashed his prison cell door while screaming about slitting the throats of guards.

            She told jurors that Saipov smiled when he described his attack to investigators hours afterward because his massacre “made him happy.”

            “He had no remorse then,” Houle said. “And the evidence will show he has continued to have no remorse.”

            Defense attorney David Stern told jurors to let Saipov spend the rest of his life in a prison cell the size of a parking space in a high-security supermax prison in Florence, Colorado.

            “Sayfullo Saipov did a terrible, terrible thing, and whatever you decide, he’ll pay a terrible price,” Stern said, referencing the attack that killed five friends from Argentina, a woman from Belgium and two Americans.

            He said Saipov's family will describe what a kind person Saipov was before he fell under the spell of propaganda from the Islamic State group.

            Stern told jurors to “not be like him"" and think death is the solution to the pain they witness.

            Saipov's lawyers achieved a legal victory Monday when Judge Vernon S. Broderick ruled that a prisoner at the Colorado supermax facility, Khalfan Khamis Mohamed, can testify from the prison instead of the Manhattan courtroom.

            Stern said Mohamed, 49, will testify in the penalty phase about what life is like under such strict prison conditions.

            Mohamed and another man were the last two defendants to face a death penalty phase in Manhattan federal court. A jury in 2001 voted against death after the men were convicted in the 1998 synchronized bombings of two U.S. embassies in Africa that killed 224 people, including a dozen Americans, and wounded thousands of others.

            Stern represented Mohamed at the trial, where prosecutors said Mohamed helped build a bomb that exploded at the U.S. Embassy in Tanzania.

            New York does not have capital punishment and hasn’t executed anyone since 1963, but Saipov’s trial is in federal court, where a death sentence is still an option. The last time a person was executed for a federal crime in New York was in 1954.

            President Joe Biden put a moratorium on federal executions after taking office and his Justice Department has not, until now, initiated any new death penalty proceedings.

            Saipov's lawyers have argued it is unconstitutional for prosecutors to seek his execution when the government has stopped seeking death in so many other cases, including some with defendants who killed more people.

            “There is no rhyme, reason, or predictability as to why the government chooses to seek death in some murder cases but not in others,” they wrote in one recent court filing.

            They noted that then-President Donald Trump quickly urged a death sentence, tweeting a day after the attack that Saipov “SHOULD GET DEATH PENALTY!” The lawyers said it was Trump’s way of furthering “his anti-immigrant agenda.”

            “There is a legitimate concern that the death penalty sometimes (and impermissibly) turns on the defendant’s race, ethnicity, national origin, and religious beliefs,” they wrote.

            Broderick rejected the argument Monday before opening statements in the penalty phase began.

            Houle told jurors that more victims will describe their pain during the penalty phase. In the first phase of the trial, jurors heard from survivors who described the horror and sorrow at losing loved ones and the pain they continue to suffer from injuries.

            Stern acknowledged that Saipov has been unrepentant since he was shot after emerging from his truck and waving pellet and paintball guns at a police officer. Later, in a hospital bed, the Uzbekistan citizen smiled as he requested that a flag of the Islamic State group that inspired his rampage be put on his room's wall, prosecutors said.

            Prosecutors plan to introduce evidence intended to show jurors that, if kept alive, Saipov may still be able to communicate with sympathizers.

            Saipov’s lawyers said before trial that he would be willing to plead guilty and consent to life in prison if death was not sought.

            Any death sentence rendered by the jury would likely by subject to years of appeals.

            New York's last federal death penalty case involved a man who murdered two police officers in 2003. Federal juries in Brooklyn twice imposed a death sentence, first in 2007 and again in 2013, but each time that sentence was ultimately overturned on appeal.NEW YORK (AP) — Jurors began hearing testimony Monday to help them decide whether an Islamic extremist who killed eight people on a New York City bike path should get a death sentence, an extraordinarily rare penalty in a state that hasn't had an execution in 60 years.Sayfullo Saipov, 35, was convicted last month in the attack.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808639,Iran releases filmmaker held for 6 months over criticism,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iran has relased an award-winning filmmaker more than six months after arresting him for criticizing the government, a pro-reform newspaper reported Monday.

            Mohammad Rasoulof, whose 2020 film, “There is No Evil,” won the top prize at the Berlin International Film Festival, is one of several prominent artists, athletes and other celebrities detained in recent months for criticizing authorities.

            He was arrested in July for criticizing the government's crackdown on protests in the southwestern city of Abadan over a deadly building collapse. Two months later, nationwide protests broke out after a 22-year-old woman died in the custody of the country's morality police.











            The Shargh newspaper, which is associated with the country's reform movement, said Rasoulof had recently been furloughed from prison and was formally released, without specifying the dates or providing further information. There was no official comment.

            Earlier this month, Iran released famed director Jafar Panahi, who was arrested in July after inquiring about the detention of Rasoulof and another colleague. Authorities also released Iranian actress Taraneh Alidoosti on bail, after she was detained for criticizing the crackdown on the latest protests.

            Iranians took to the streets over the September death of Mahsa Amini, a Kurdish Iranian woman who was detained by the morality police for allegedly violating the country's strict Islamic dress code. The protests escalated into calls for the overthrow of the country's ruling clerics, marking one of the biggest challenges they have faced since coming to power in the 1979 revolution.

            At least 529 protesters have been killed and nearly 20,000 arrested since those protests began, according to Human Rights Activists in Iran, a group that has closely monitored the unrest. Iranian authorities have not released official figures for those killed or arrested.

            “There Is No Evil,” which tells four stories loosely connected to the use of the death penalty in Iran, won the Golden Bear prize at Berlin in 2020. Rasoulof wasn’t there to accept the award due to a travel ban imposed on him by Iranian authorities.DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iran has relased an award-winning filmmaker more than six months after arresting him for criticizing the government, a pro-reform newspaper reported Monday.Mohammad Rasoulof, whose 2020 film, “There is No Evil,” won the top prize at the Berlin International Film Festival, is one of several prominent artists, athletes and other celebrities detained in recent months for criticizing authorities.He was arrested in July for criticizing the government's crackdown on protests in the southwestern city of Abadan over a deadly building collapse.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808640,AP source: Derek Carr turns down trade offer to Saints,"LAS VEGAS (AP) — Quarterback Derek Carr turned down a trade offer from the Las Vegas Raiders to the New Orleans Saints, a person with knowledge of the decision said Sunday.

            The person spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to comment publicly.

            That person said Carr wouldn't accept a pay cut to help finalize the deal, and the Saints were the only team interested in making a trade with the Raiders. Carr has a no-trade clause in his contract.











            Given those circumstances and Wednesday's deadline for the Raiders to trade or release Carr, it appears Las Vegas will cut the veteran quarterback. If the Raiders keep him on their roster, they will owe him $40.4 million in guaranteed money over the next two years.

            
                He indicated Feb. 2 that being released and hitting the free-agent market was his preferred route, saying then he wouldn't waive his no-trade clause.

            Carr visited the New Orleans Saints last week, according to three sources with knowledge of the trip.

            Carr, 31, played nine seasons for the Raiders and holds club records for yards passing (35,222) and touchdown passes (217), but without a playoff victory. The Raiders benched him with two games remaining this season, partly because Carr was struggling and partly because they would owe him the guaranteed money if he got hurt.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808641,Mbappé could face Bayern in ECL after rapid injury recovery,"PARIS (AP) — Kylian Mbappé has made an unexpectedly quick recovery from injury and Paris Saint-Germain coach Christophe Galtier hopes he can face Bayern Munich on Tuesday in the first leg of their round-of-16 Champions League clash.

            The World Cup superstar was expected to be out for three weeks after tearing a muscle in his left thigh on Feb. 1 and the jet-heeled forward's speedy return has surprised Galtier.

            “Kylian trained with the squad today and completed the whole session. I didn’t think he would be ready,"" Galtier said at Monday's news conference. “We took the decision to let him take part if he felt ready. We’re not quite sure if he’ll be on the team sheet, we’ll see tomorrow morning.”











            Mbappé won't be on the bench for the sake of it.

            “We’ll ask Kylian if he feels ready, Kylian’s made a huge effort,” Galtier said. “If he’s on the team sheet it means he’s ready.”

            Neymar hopes to line up alongside Mbappé and Lionel Messi, who has shaken off a sore hamstring.

            “Kylian is an extremely important player for us, he’s a star,"" Neymar said through a translator. “Obviously we feel stronger when all three of us are playing.” 

            Neymar is the world’s most expensive player at 222 million euros ($237 million) but Mbappé is only the second player to have scored a hat trick in a World Cup final. 

            PSG really needs its France star after some poor results.

            “I hope Kylian can play for a few minutes. He told me he’s feeling well, so that’s a good sign,"" Neymar said. “Our biggest objective is (winning) the Champions League. It’s like the World Cup, if you make the slightest mistake you go out.”

            Tensions have been running high at PSG after successive defeats to Marseille in the French Cup and to Monaco in the league on Saturday. 

            
                PSG's 3-1 loss to Monaco was its fourth defeat in 10 games and the loss would have been far heavier if not for goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma. Sporting director Luis Campos was reportedly so angered by the abject performance that he argued with Neymar and captain Marquinhos later.

            “Yes there was a discussion, we didn’t agree with what we heard,"" Neymar said. ""But these things happen. Football isn’t just about love and friendship.""

            Comparing it to an argument with his girlfriend, Neymar said straight talking is necessary.

            “The respect is there but there are times when you don't agree and discussions happen to make things better,” Neymar said. “It’s true that our recent performances haven’t been very good. Of course it’s unsettling when there are defeats.”

            Neymar, however, was also upset that the dispute was leaked.

            “It’s not normal that everything that happens comes out of the dressing room, it should stay between us,” he said. “We know that we have some weaknesses, but I'm sure we'll see the best of PSG tomorrow.”

            Galtier was good at identifying PSG's weaknesses when his former teams faced the club. He was undefeated in five games against the club with Lille and Nice, without even conceding a goal, so PSG hired him in July.

            However, Galtier seems unable to remedy the same problem areas he expertly exploited, and faces a Bayern side hitting form with 11 goals in three matches.

            Galtier said there have been frank talks with the players.

            “When there’s frustration it needs to come out,"" he said. “Of course there’s disappointment and anger after defeats. We’ve had discussions, I listened to my players and I hope they listened to me.”

            After joking that he's using “anti-wrinkle” cream to hide the stress he's under, the 56-year-old Galtier said his players would respond against Bayern.

            “My players can raise their level of performance and their commitment,” he said.

            
                The World Cup top scorer Mbappé posted a message on Instagram following the Monaco defeat in a bid to motivate teammates and fans.

            “Let’s stay strong & united,” he wrote. 

            Cash-rich PSG is desperate to win the Champions League for the first time, while also bidding to avoid a second straight elimination in the last 16 after last season's humiliating defeat by Real Madrid. 

            Some 50 PSG ultras made their feelings known on Sunday, jeering the players as they arrived for training.

            “I understand the anger of the fans,” Galtier said.

            In 2019, PSG became the first team to be eliminated after winning the away leg 2-0, losing to Manchester United 3-1 at Parc des Princes after conceding a stoppage-time penalty. 

            In 2017, PSG was the first team knocked out after winning the first leg 4-0, losing 6-1 at Barcelona. 

            And last year, Karim Benzema scored a hat trick for Madrid in less than 20 minutes as PSG crumbled in the second half, having again won the first leg.

            Bayern has won the German league a record 32 times and clinched its sixth Champions League title when it defeated PSG 1-0 in the final in 2020, with former PSG winger Kingsley Coman heading the winner.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808646,Appier records its first profitable year and forecasts profitable growth for 2023,"Achieved annual operating profit one year ahead of schedule

TAIPEI, TAIWAN -  Media OutReach - 13 February 2023 -   Highlights and achievements for fiscal year 2022         Annual revenue increased to 19.4 billion yen with a 53% YoY growth rate, surpassing previous guidance of 19.2 billion yen         Full-year operating profit target reached one year ahead of schedule, with operating margins at 0.3% and improving by 9 percentage points YoY         Annual gross profit accelerated to 60% YoY, with a gross margin of 51.5%, more than tripled in the last 4 years         Revenue from US and EMEA markets increased over 7 times YoY and represented 12% of total revenues      Guidance for fiscal year 2023         Forecast of 31% (34% on FX neutral basis) increase in YoY revenue growth to 25.5 billion yen and gross profit growth is expected to surpass revenue growth at 35% YoY due to further gross margin improvement.         Increase in operating income by around 10 times to 535 million yen and further improve operating margin to 2.1%         Continuous geographic and vertical expansion, along with ROI-driven solutions and further product synergies for better up-sell and cross-sell opportunities, to be key growth drivers in FY23         Continued growth of AI trends to drive further business growth      Highlight and achievements of Q4 FY22         Revenue increased by 47% YoY and hit a historical high of 5.8 billion yen         Annual recurring revenue YoY growth rate further increased from 46% to 53%         Gross profit reached 56% YoY growth with a record-high gross profit of 3 billion yen         Attained both EBITDA margin and operating margin improvement of 6 percentage points YoY         Grew customers by 26% YoY, alongside a low customer churn rate of 0.62%      Closing out the year with a stellar performance   Appier Group Inc (TSE: 4180), henceforth referred to as Appier, today announced its fiscal and fourth-quarter earnings results for the year ended 31 December 2022. Appier closed out the fiscal year of 2022 achieving a full-year operating profit for the first time, one year ahead of schedule from its FY23 target, with a revenue increase of 53% YoY at 19.4 billion yen. This year marks growth acceleration for Appier for four years in a row, as annual gross profit more than tripled in the last four years to accelerate to 60% YoY. EBITDA margin rose to 7%, keeping the company on a strong trajectory toward its 2025 financial targets.   Appier's strong performance was attributed to the continuous expansion of its customer base both regionally and vertically, alongside robust product synergies and successful customer retention through up-sell and cross-sell strategies. Northeast Asia (63%) continued to reach high growth despite a large revenue base, while revenues in Greater China (20%) were mainly driven by vertical growth. US and EMEA (12%) continue to be a key growth driver with a larger total addressable market (TAM), as it increased its revenue over 7 times YoY in the fiscal year.   The company's further expansion to more diversified verticals led to stronger growth acceleration. The Digital Content (gaming, entertainment, e-books, and online streaming) vertical grew significantly with 10 percentage points YoY increase in FY22 to constitute 38% of total revenues, only second to Ecommerce (43%), then followed by Other Internet Services[1] (12%) and Consumer Brands and BFSI (7%). Strong demand from these digital-first industries will continue as they place digital strategies at the forefront of their transformation under the new normal post-COVID.   In addition to growing the total number of customers by 26% in FY22, Appier's higher business efficiency also resulted in a higher customer Lifetime Value (LTV) at 64% YoY and a lower Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) at -12% YoY. The higher LTV was driven by a lower churn rate of customer revenue and higher gross profit per customer; while the lower CAC was driven by lower expenses on new customer acquisition and a higher number of net new customers.   The successful transfer from the Mothers segment to the Prime segment on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) in December 2022 is also a significant testament to the sophisticated organization with strong growth and good corporate governance.   A strong quarter to close out a profitable year   Appier's revenue in Q4 grew at a rate of 47% YoY to record a historical high of 5.8 billion yen, reaching a gross profit of 56% YoY growth. Operating margins reached 137 million yen, providing a strong tail end to close out a profitable fiscal year 2022. The company also retained a low customer churn rate of 0.62%.   ""2022 has been a year of growth acceleration for Appier. We achieved full-year profitability one year ahead of schedule and tripled our revenue and gross profit in four years. These great results reflect that the market is responding well to the first-party data trends and our ROI-driven solutions powered by AI,"" said Dr. Chih-Han Yu, CEO and Co-Founder, Appier. ""2023 is an important year for exciting developments in AI. Supporting customers to gain the most value from AI trends and technologies through their digital transformation journeys remains a key priority for us. With the current trajectory that Appier is on, along with our core value of innovative technology enhancement, a customer-centric mindset, and prudent M&A approach, we are confident that we are on the right track to reach our targets this year.""   Strong business momentum for future growth   Appier's 2023 guidance comes with forecasted annual revenue growth of 31% (34% on FX neutral basis) to reach 25.5 billion yen. The overall outlook for 2023 is optimistic, with annual gross profit growth of 35% YoY, an operating income increase of around 10 times to 535 million yen, and an EBITDA profit of 2.34 billion yen with a 72% YoY growth rate. The company also targets to achieve operating margins of 2.1% following its strong business momentum.   Looking ahead to FY23, Appier is confident about the future. The influence of first-party data trends and new technologies in AI, alongside the company's strategic geographical and vertical expansions, and its focus on cutting-edge innovation, are set to consolidate demand for Appier's solutions that turn customers' marketing investments into measurable returns.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808656,Cambodia shuts down one of its last independent news outlets,"Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen on Sunday ordered the shutdown of one of the last few local independent news outlets.He claimed that the organization, The Voice of Democracy (VOD), had intentionally slandered him and his son in an article about the country's relief assistance to earthquake victims in Turkey.VOD will no longer have a license to publish or broadcast from 10 a.m. local time (0300 UTC) on Monday, the prime minister said in a Facebook statement.In an article published Wednesday, VOD quoted government spokesperson Phay Siphan as saying that Hun Sen's son — Hun Manet — had signed the $100,000 (€ 93,750) aid agreement on behalf of the prime minister.Hun Manet is the joint chief of staff and deputy commander for the country's armed forces. He has been nominated by the ruling party to succeed his father in future elections.By signing such an agreement, Hun Manet appeared to have overstepped the bounds of his position.The prime minister initially gave VOD 72 hours to verify the facts with the Ministry of Information and demanded a public apology.VOD sent a letter to Hun Sen's Cabinet saying it was sorry for any confusion it may have caused and explained that the organization had only quoted a government spokesperson.Hun Sen said the response was unacceptable and, on Sunday, ordered the ministry to revoke VOD's license.""Commentators tried to attack me and my son Hun Manet,"" Hun Sen said, adding that the VOD story hurt the ""dignity and reputation"" of the Cambodian government.He ordered the police to ""keep order"" but not seize property, and asked the staff of VOD to ""find new jobs at other places.""There was no immediate comment from Phay Siphan on the incident.Hun Sen is one of the world's longest-serving dictators. Many of his political rivals have been jailed and exiled, and multiple critical media outlets have been shut.In 2017, The Cambodia Daily — which had a reputation for breaking news on tough issues — was shut down just months ahead of the last general election in 2018.The paper was slapped with a $6.3 million (€ 5.9 million) tax bill and given one month to pay it.ns/fb (AP, Reuters, AFP)",2023/02/13,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808667,US House select committee on China mulling Taiwan trip,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A U.S. House special committee on China is in discussions to send a delegation to Taiwan, Nikkei reported on Sunday (Feb. 12).

            Representative Rob Wittman and a senior member of the House Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party told the outlet that they and other members of the committee are looking into the possibility of a trip to Taiwan.

            “We know that will infuriate the Chinese,” Wittman told Nikkei. “But I think it’s incredibly important for us to do that, because you have to send the signal that we’re strongly on the side of Taiwan.”

            While the scheduling of the trip still needs to be discussed, the delegation could hold a field hearing in Taiwan, Wittman added. The select committee, which will start activities at the end of February, cannot approve laws, but will look at China through the lens of national security, the economy, and human rights and will make policy recommendations on China to other House committees, Nikkei said.











            The China select committee is also planning other trips to Asia besides Taiwan. Wittman said a delegation will visit Southeast Asia around the end of March, and that Japan could also be a possible destination.

            In addition, Representative Michael McCaul, who chairs the House Foreign Affairs Committee, is slated to lead a bipartisan delegation to Taiwan in the spring, per the report. “The chairman is definitely planning a trip to Asia focused on shoring up our important alliances in the Indo-Pacific,” an aide told the outlet, adding “And he is hopeful that will include a trip to Taiwan.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808680,"Dubai boom sees Russian cash, high rents and reborn projects","DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Fourteen years after a financial crisis nearly brought Dubai to its knees, several major abandoned real estate projects are finally showing signs of life as part of a new economic boom in the city-state.

            As with previous upturns in Dubai, war is a driving force. But this time it’s Russian investors fleeing Moscow’s war on Ukraine, rather than people escaping Mideast battlefields.

            “There’s lots of parts of the world where there are real challenges and people looking for a safe haven,” said Richard Waind, group managing director for Betterhomes, a real estate brokerage in the emirate. “I think that’s a safe haven both for the capital but also for their families.”











            While there’s no sign the market could be in similar trouble as in 2009, some concerns have started to surface. Skyrocketing rental costs are worsening a cost-of-living squeeze for the foreign workforce that powers the emirate. 

            Meanwhile, the U.S. Treasury is worried about the amount of Russian money flowing into the real estate market of the most populous city in the United Arab Emirates.

            “In theory, there should be significant reputational risk with the UAE apparently acting as a willing bridge, enabling Russian oligarchs to use the Emirates as a waystation between the Russian financial system and that of the West,” said Jodi Vittori, a nonresident scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who has written extensively on Dubai being a money-laundering haven.

            “But the reality seems to point otherwise,” she said. 

            Dubai's government and the UAE's Foreign Ministry did not respond to detailed questions from The Associated Press. 

            It’s hard to overstate just how much the Emirates has changed over the last half century. Since 1968, the seven sheikdoms that make up the UAE have grown from a British protectorate of some 180,000 people to a federation that’s home to more than 9.2 million. Government statisticians say 3.5 million people live in Dubai alone, with an additional 1.1 million who temporarily live in the city or commute there for work each day. 

            Oil, much of it from Abu Dhabi’s vast reserves, fueled the UAE’s initial modernization. After Dubai began allowing foreign ownership of “freehold” properties in 2002, the world’s tallest building, cavernous malls and sprawling subdivisions emerged from what once were uninterrupted stretches of windblown sand dunes. 

            Real estate now represents some 10% of Dubai's overall gross domestic product. After a slump due to COVID-19 restrictions, Dubai saw 86,849 residential sales in 2022, beating a previous record of 80,831 set in 2009. 

            Buyers and renters have filled exclusive neighborhoods such as the Palm Jumeirah, a man-made archipelago in the shape of a palm tree that juts into the Persian Gulf. 

            The average asking rent for an apartment there is over $67,600 per year, with a villa renting for $276,000 annually, according to real estate firm CBRE. Analysts attribute growth in the luxury market to the wealthy fleeing pandemic restrictions elsewhere.

            That pressure has grown even outside the world of the ultra-wealthy. Rents on average across Dubai are up 26.9% year-on-year, even with anti-price-gouging protections. Families living in villas can expect to pay median rents of $76,000 a year. 

            The sudden increase in rent prompted Gavin Hill, a 34-year-old car salesman from Essex, England, to move with his partner from a villa in the Dubai Hills neighborhood near downtown to a smaller apartment some 20 kilometers (12 miles) south.

            “In terms of looking for a new place, previously it was reasonably easy,"" said Hill, who has moved four times in the six years he has lived in Dubai. ""This time it’s a minefield”

            Russian money has helped fuel this.

            Betterhomes, which has operated here since 1986, saw Russians lead all other nationalities in purchases by non-residents for the first time last year. Other real estate brokers have also acknowledged anecdotally the influence Russians have had.

            “Since the crisis in Eastern Europe, we have seen a lot of Russians, a lot of Ukrainians as well, looking to both move their family and and money out there,"" Waind said. 

            Dubai has a history of seeking a business advantage in crises like the Arab Spring, COVID-19 and now Russia's war on Ukraine. During the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s, its new Jebel Ali port repaired ships damaged by explosions and gunfire in the Persian Gulf. The U.S.-led wars in Afghanistan and Iraq saw wealthy émigrés arrive in Dubai and the wider UAE.

            Those booms included what the West would consider dirty money as well. Some of the nearly $1 billion embezzled in the 2010 Kabul Bank scandal in Afghanistan went toward luxury homes on Palm Jumeirah. A cousin of Syrian President Bashar Assad tied to Assad's sanctioned business dealings also owned property there. 

            It remains unclear how many Russians have bought in Dubai — and whether the purchases involve people fleeing potential conscription into the Russian army or mass purchases that can be the work of money launderers. Unlike in the U.S., where property records are public, Dubai does not offer an easily accessible database of transactions.

            A team from the U.S. Treasury stopped in the UAE on a Mideast tour in January. 

            A senior U.S. official told The Associated Press that the agency is concerned about the Russian money coming into the Dubai real estate market. The official spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity about discussing sanctions. 

            Already, the Treasury has issued an alert aimed at U.S. commercial real estate stating that Russian oligarchs and their intermediaries could use “highly complex financing methods and opaque ownership structures"" to hide illicit funds. 

            But it remains unclear what, if any, action Treasury would take, considering the defense and economic ties the U.S. has with the Emirates. A global body focused on fighting money laundering put the UAE on its “gray list” over concerns it isn’t doing enough to stop criminals and militants from hiding wealth there.

            Once-abandoned projects that are showing new life include the Dubai Pearl, a planned $4 billion luxury development that was supposed to host multiple hotels and apartments in four, 73-story towers. Those plans collapsed during the 2009 financial crisis, brought on by the Great Recession, that forced Abu Dhabi to provide the city-state a $20 billion bailout.

            Demolition crews are now bringing down the concrete husk of the Dubai Pearl, though plans for the site remain unclear. 

            Plans for the development of Palm Jumeirah's forgotten twin, the Palm Jebel Ali, are also being relaunched.

            One practice that helped fuel Dubai's 2009 crisis involved speculators buying yet-to-be built properties. “Off-plan” flipping is growing again as initial buyers “are capitalizing on the current market upswing and cashing out with a premium in hand,” local firm Property Monitor said.

            That company and others warn that speculative purchasing could lead to another bubble. 

            “This does suggest a rise in speculative activity, which is a feature of any market that is seeing price rises,” said Scott Livermore, the chief economist at Oxford Economics Middle East. 

            Hill — the renter from England — would like to buy a place if the market comes down again. But he's cautious after what he's seen in this boomtown.

            Dubai ""can eat people out and spit them out quite quickly,"" Hill said. ""I’ve seen too many people go crazy and then go bust very, very fast.”

            Follow Jon Gambrell on Twitter at www.twitter.com/jongambrellAP.DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Fourteen years after a financial crisis nearly brought Dubai to its knees, several major abandoned real estate projects are finally showing signs of life as part of a new economic boom in the city-state.As with previous upturns in Dubai, war is a driving force. But this time it’s Russian investors fleeing Moscow’s war on Ukraine, rather than people escaping Mideast battlefields.“There’s lots of parts of the world where there are real challenges and people looking for a safe haven,” said Richard Waind, group managing director for Betterhomes, a real estate brokerage in the emirate. “I think that’s a safe haven both for the capital but also for their families.”While there’s no sign the market could be in similar trouble as in 2009, some concerns have started to surface. Skyrocketing rental costs are worsening a cost-of-living squeeze for the foreign workforce that powers the emirate.Meanwhile, the U.S. Treasury is worried about the amount of Russian money flowing into the real estate market of the most populous city in the United Arab Emirates.“In theory, there should be significant reputational risk with the UAE apparently acting as a willing bridge, enabling Russian oligarchs to use the Emirates as a waystation between the Russian financial system and that of the West,” said Jodi Vittori, a nonresident scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who has written extensively on Dubai being a money-laundering haven.“But the reality seems to point otherwise,” she said.Dubai's government and the UAE's Foreign Ministry did not respond to detailed questions from The Associated Press.It’s hard to overstate just how much the Emirates has changed over the last half century. Since 1968, the seven sheikdoms that make up the UAE have grown from a British protectorate of some 180,000 people to a federation that’s home to more than 9.2 million. Government statisticians say 3.5 million people live in Dubai alone, with an additional 1.1 million who temporarily live in the city or commute there for work each day.Oil, much of it from Abu Dhabi’s vast reserves, fueled the UAE’s initial modernization. After Dubai began allowing foreign ownership of “freehold” properties in 2002, the world’s tallest building, cavernous malls and sprawling subdivisions emerged from what once were uninterrupted stretches of windblown sand dunes.Real estate now represents some 10% of Dubai's overall gross domestic product. After a slump due to COVID-19 restrictions, Dubai saw 86,849 residential sales in 2022, beating a previous record of 80,831 set in 2009.Buyers and renters have filled exclusive neighborhoods such as the Palm Jumeirah, a man-made archipelago in the shape of a palm tree that juts into the Persian Gulf.The average asking rent for an apartment there is over $67,600 per year, with a villa renting for $276,000 annually, according to real estate firm CBRE. Analysts attribute growth in the luxury market to the wealthy fleeing pandemic restrictions elsewhere.That pressure has grown even outside the world of the ultra-wealthy. Rents on average across Dubai are up 26.9% year-on-year, even with anti-price-gouging protections. Families living in villas can expect to pay median rents of $76,000 a year.The sudden increase in rent prompted Gavin Hill, a 34-year-old car salesman from Essex, England, to move with his partner from a villa in the Dubai Hills neighborhood near downtown to a smaller apartment some 20 kilometers (12 miles) south.“In terms of looking for a new place, previously it was reasonably easy,"" said Hill, who has moved four times in the six years he has lived in Dubai. ""This time it’s a minefield”Russian money has helped fuel this.Betterhomes, which has operated here since 1986, saw Russians lead all other nationalities in purchases by non-residents for the first time last year. Other real estate brokers have also acknowledged anecdotally the influence Russians have had.“Since the crisis in Eastern Europe, we have seen a lot of Russians, a lot of Ukrainians as well, looking to both move their family and and money out there,"" Waind said.Dubai has a history of seeking a business advantage in crises like the Arab Spring, COVID-19 and now Russia's war on Ukraine. During the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s, its new Jebel Ali port repaired ships damaged by explosions and gunfire in the Persian Gulf. The U.S.-led wars in Afghanistan and Iraq saw wealthy émigrés arrive in Dubai and the wider UAE.Those booms included what the West would consider dirty money as well. Some of the nearly $1 billion embezzled in the 2010 Kabul Bank scandal in Afghanistan went toward luxury homes on Palm Jumeirah. A cousin of Syrian President Bashar Assad tied to Assad's sanctioned business dealings also owned property there.It remains unclear how many Russians have bought in Dubai — and whether the purchases involve people fleeing potential conscription into the Russian army or mass purchases that can be the work of money launderers.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808681,"Dubai again plans for flying taxi takeoff, this time by 2026","DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Dubai again is planning for the takeoff of flying taxis in this futuristic city-state on the Arabian Peninsula, offering its firmest details yet Monday for a pledged launch by 2026. 

            Since 2017, the commercial capital of the United Arab Emirates has offered promises to launch flying taxis in the city already home to the world's tallest building and other architectural wonders. A series of different types and companies have cycled through those promises as well, most timed to be included at Dubai's annual World Government Summit, which saw this year's edition begin Monday. 

            Dubai's ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, announced the relaunched flying taxi program on Twitter Sunday. This time, Dubai highlighted the six-rotor electric flying taxi made by Joby Aviation of Santa Cruz, California, in the promotional video.











            The inclusion of Joby Aviation, rather than the Chinese-made EHang 184 and XPeng X2 or the German-made electric Volocopter all previously displayed in Dubai, wasn't explained by Emirati officials. Joby aircraft featured at a stand at the World Government Summit on Monday.

            “We’re excited about the opportunity and actively exploring the possibility,” said Oliver Walker-Jones, a spokesman for Joby Aviation. 

            Ahmed Bahrozyan, an official in the emirate’s Roads and Transport Authority, similarly told the state-owned Dubai Eye radio station on Monday that ""it’s early days” for the plan. 

            “We haven’t yet signed with any partners yet,"" he said. 

            Another difference in this year's promise on flying taxis is the release of specifics about the program. The city plans four “vertiports” by Dubai International Airport, the world’s busiest for international travel, downtown Dubai, the manmade Palm Jumeirah archipelago and Dubai Marina. Those points will include two launching pads and four charging points for the flying taxis. 

            “We believe those are attractive areas with business hubs and tourist hubs that could generate considerable demand,” Bahrozyan said. 

            The pricing for the flying taxis “will be in the range of a limousine service in Dubai, maybe slightly higher,” Bahrozyan said. The RTA describes limo services rates as “at least 30% higher than taxi fares” in the city. Taxis have a minimum fare of around $3.25 and charge $0.50 a kilometer. 

            Another departure from earlier plans include the RTA planning to have piloted flying taxis at first, rather than autonomous ones as previously discussed. Dubai officials described the taxi as having a pilot with four seats for passengers on board, which match Joby's electric flying taxi. However, Bahrozyan said tests would continue with autonomous flying taxis as well.

            The Joby prototype can fly over 240 kilometers (150 miles) before needing a charge — something which would put Abu Dhabi and other areas of the country within range. It takes off and lands vertically, while its rotors tilt forward in flight. It has a maximum speed of 320 kph (200 mph).

            Joby Avation Inc., which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, was at $4.20 a share before trading Monday. Its major shareholders include Intel Corp., while Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines also has invested.

            The video posted by Sheikh Mohammed's Twitter account also included the logo of London-based Skyports Infrastructure, which also refers to its support projects as “vertiports.” The company already is testing its “vertiport” model outside of Paris and is working with Joby. Skyports did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 

            Opening the skies to flying taxis would add to the “Blade Runner” skyline of Dubai, while also easing the real-world grind of daily traffic that’s only worsening as its population booms to over 3.5 million people.

            Rush hour on Sheikh Zayed Road, a dozen-lane artery running down the length of the Dubai, alternates between dense gridlock and sports-car slalom. Over 1.8 million Dubai-registered vehicles ply its roads, not counting those crowding in from the United Arab Emirates’ six other sheikhdoms.

            There’s also the desire to move away from carbon-belching gasoline and diesel vehicles as the UAE will host the upcoming United Nations COP28 climate talks later this year. That’s even as the Emirates hopes to expand its production of crude oil ahead of a promised “carbon-neutral” future by 2050. Meanwhile, Dubai hopes to have a quarter of all cars on its roads be driverless by 2030.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808687,Taiwan’s Fo Guang Shan founder Master Hsing Yun's final farewell,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Master Hsing Yun (星雲), the 48th Patriarch of the Linji School (臨濟宗) and the founder of Fo Guang Shan, was celebrated in a funerary ceremony which began at 9 a.m. on Monday (Feb. 13).As per the late master’s wishes, a simple ceremony befitting a common monk was arranged. Bright sunshine and clear skies facilitated matters as huge throngs of devotees waited outdoors to see their spiritual master on his final earthly voyage.The day started with an hour-long ceremony held in the Cloud Dwelling Building attended by political dignitaries including President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) and Premier Chen Chien-jen (陳建仁), per UDN.Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen presents an official citation to Master Hsing Yun. (CNA photo)Tsai presented the late master with a “Presidential Citation Award,” and in an accompanying letter read aloud, praised Hsing Yun for his promotion of Buddhism through the establishment of 300 monasteries and five universities around the world, as well as communion and cooperation with all of the world’s major religions.Other prominent politicians in attendance included Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chi-mai (陳其邁) who presented Hsing Yung with the “Honorary Citizen Award.” KMT Chairman Eric Chu (朱立倫) then bestowed the late master with the “Highest Recognition of Outstanding Contribution Award,” per UDN.In a short video presentation, Master Hsing Yun appeared on screen describing himself first as a “a little star, a floating crowd.” Later he recounted a chance encounter with a Chinese dictionary where he saw the words (星雲) which means “nebula,” a cosmological occurrence that is vast in size, bigger than many galaxies. He later thought he wanted to be just as vast as a nebula with similar far-reaching accomplishments, as he soon adopted the name.Tens of thousands of devotees prostrate at Master Hsing Yun funeral. (CNA photo)Later, Fo Guang Shan Abbot Hsin Bau (心保) expressed thanks and appreciation for the outpouring of support offered by the public since Hsing Yun’s passing on Feb. 5. He thanked everyone for attending the ceremony and noted that the best way to remember their beloved master is to practice Humanistic Buddhism in their daily lives. He noted Hsing Yun wished to be a monk again in his next life, and he believed the late master would soon “sail the compassionate ship” and return.Hsing Yun’s body then left the Cloud Dwelling Building, undertaking a final procession around the grounds of Fo Guang Shan Monastery. His body traveled in a seated position inside a stupa-type casket which was carried by a group of monks as it exited the building, and then was placed in the back of a flatbed truck as it toured the monastery’s premises where devotees prostrated themselves.Hsing Yun established Fo Guang Shan Monastery in 1967 in Dashu District, Kaohsiung, turning a bamboo hillside into a monastery for 1,000 monks to study Pure Land or Humanistic Buddhism. In the early days, Hsing Yun and other monks carried cement and building materials to build the main halls and the dormitories, per UDN.Fo Guang Shan is now an immense facility stretching across 30 hectares. Hsing Yun’s teachings have inspired more than 2,000 people to become monks across five continents and millions of devotees around the world.Master Hsing Yun proselytized the way of the dharma. (CNA photo)Hsing Yun has been described as one of the “Four Heavenly Kings” of Buddhism, one of the last remaining teachers along with Tzu Chi’s Master Cheng Yen, who proselytized Humanistic Buddhism, which emphasized charitable works and compassion for all sentient beings.His commitment to helping others led him to found numerous monasteries along with charitable groups, hospitals, and clinics. He also founded the Buddha's Light International Association (BLIA) for lay practitioners of Buddhism.After a procession around the grounds of Fo Guang Shan to tens of thousands of monastic and lay devotees from all five continents who lined the road to pay their final respects, genuflecting to show their devotion as his body passed by, he finally made his way to a cremation ceremony which began exactly at 2:22 p.m.Held in a large tented space, Hsing Yun’s body was transferred to a cylindrical casket and wheeled before an altar of flowers and a large picture of Sakyamuni Buddha, the original teacher of Buddhism. Elder monks from Fo Guang Shan came to a podium in pairs of three to make incense offerings.Master Hsing Yun founded 300 Buddhist monasteries around the world. (CNA photo)The audience was then asked to kneel as the final steps of the funerary ceremony were carried out. Eight monks came forward to lift Hsing Yun’s casket onto a cremation platform, and elders from Fo Guang Shan Monastery placed a purple satin Dharani Shroud printed with the Dharani Sutra, which is thought to absolve people of past sins.A few final words were read by Fo Guang Shan Abbot Hsin Bau, and Hsing Yun’s body then entered the crematorium where the torch was lit while the audience sang “The Song of Farewell,” which was one of the late master’s favorite songs. As for his final resting spot in his current incarnation, Master Hsing Yun’s ashes will ultimately be placed in Fo Guang Shan’s Longevity Garden.",2023/02/13,1901,Culture

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808692,Appier records its first profitable year and forecasts profitable growth for 2023,"Achieved annual operating profit one year ahead of schedule

TAIPEI, Feb. 13, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- 

Highlights and achievements for fiscal year 2022  Annual revenue increased to 19.4 billion yen with a 53% YoY growth rate, surpassing previous guidance of 19.2 billion yen Full-year operating profit target reached one year ahead of schedule, with operating margins at 0.3% and improving by 9 percentage points YoY Annual gross profit accelerated to 60% YoY, with a gross margin of 51.5%, more than tripled in the last 4 years Revenue from US and EMEA markets increased over 7 times YoY and represented 12% of total revenues 

Guidance for fiscal year 2023  Forecast of 31% (34% on FX neutral basis) increase in YoY revenue growth to 25.5 billion yen and gross profit growth is expected to surpass revenue growth at 35% YoY due to further gross margin improvement. Increase in operating income by around 10 times to 535 million yen and further improve operating margin to 2.1% Continuous geographic and vertical expansion, along with ROI-driven solutions and further product synergies for better up-sell and cross-sell opportunities, to be key growth drivers in FY23 Continued growth of AI trends to drive further business growth 











Highlight and achievements of Q4 FY22  Revenue increased by 47% YoY and hit a historical high of 5.8 billion yen Annual recurring revenue YoY growth rate further increased from 46% to 53% Gross profit reached 56% YoY growth with a record-high gross profit of 3 billion yen Attained both EBITDA margin and operating margin improvement of 6 percentage points YoY Grew customers by 26% YoY, alongside a low customer churn rate of 0.62% 

Closing out the year with a stellar performance

            Appier Group Inc (TSE: 4180), henceforth referred to as Appier, today announced its fiscal and fourth-quarter earnings results for the year ended 31 December 2022. Appier closed out the fiscal year of 2022 achieving a full-year operating profit for the first time, one year ahead of schedule from its FY23 target, with a revenue increase of 53% YoY at 19.4 billion yen. This year marks growth acceleration for Appier for four years in a row, as annual gross profit more than tripled in the last four years to accelerate to 60% YoY. EBITDA margin rose to 7%, keeping the company on a strong trajectory toward its 2025 financial targets.

            Appier's strong performance was attributed to the continuous expansion of its customer base both regionally and vertically, alongside robust product synergies and successful customer retention through up-sell and cross-sell strategies. Northeast Asia (63%) continued to reach high growth despite a large revenue base, while revenues in Greater China (20%) were mainly driven by vertical growth. US and EMEA (12%) continue to be a key growth driver with a larger total addressable market (TAM), as it increased its revenue over 7 times YoY in the fiscal year.

            The company's further expansion to more diversified verticals led to stronger growth acceleration. The Digital Content (gaming, entertainment, e-books, and online streaming) vertical grew significantly with 10 percentage points YoY increase in FY22 to constitute 38% of total revenues, only second to Ecommerce (43%), then followed by Other Internet Services [1] (12%) and Consumer Brands and BFSI (7%). Strong demand from these digital-first industries will continue as they place digital strategies at the forefront of their transformation under the new normal post-COVID.

            In addition to growing the total number of customers by 26% in FY22, Appier's higher business efficiency also resulted in a higher customer Lifetime Value (LTV) at 64% YoY and a lower Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) at -12% YoY. The higher LTV was driven by a lower churn rate of customer revenue and higher gross profit per customer; while the lower CAC was driven by lower expenses on new customer acquisition and a higher number of net new customers. 

            The successful transfer from the Mothers segment to the Prime segment on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) in December 2022 is also a significant testament to the sophisticated organization with strong growth and good corporate governance.

A strong quarter to close out a profitable year

            Appier's revenue in Q4 grew at a rate of 47% YoY to record a historical high of 5.8 billion yen, reaching a gross profit of 56% YoY growth. Operating margins reached 137 million yen, providing a strong tail end to close out a profitable fiscal year 2022. The company also retained a low customer churn rate of 0.62%.

            ""2022 has been a year of growth acceleration for Appier. We achieved full-year profitability one year ahead of schedule and tripled our revenue and gross profit in four years. These great results reflect that the market is responding well to the first-party data trends and our ROI-driven solutions powered by AI,"" said Dr. Chih-Han Yu, CEO and Co-Founder, Appier. ""2023 is an important year for exciting developments in AI. Supporting customers to gain the most value from AI trends and technologies through their digital transformation journeys remains a key priority for us. With the current trajectory that Appier is on, along with our core value of innovative technology enhancement, a customer-centric mindset, and prudent M&A approach, we are confident that we are on the right track to reach our targets this year.""

Strong business momentum for future growth

            Appier's 2023 guidance comes with forecasted annual revenue growth of 31% (34% on FX neutral basis) to reach 25.5 billion yen. The overall outlook for 2023 is optimistic, with annual gross profit growth of 35% YoY, an operating income increase of around 10 times to 535 million yen, and an EBITDA profit of 2.34 billion yen with a 72% YoY growth rate. The company also targets to achieve operating margins of 2.1% following its strong business momentum.

            Looking ahead to FY23, Appier is confident about the future. The influence of first-party data trends and new technologies in AI, alongside the company's strategic geographical and vertical expansions, and its focus on cutting-edge innovation, are set to consolidate demand for Appier's solutions that turn customers' marketing investments into measurable returns.
