https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818700,"Harrington, Pepper among 12 finalists for golf Hall of Fame","Three-time major champion Padraig Harrington, double major winner Dottie Pepper and swing coach Butch Harmon were among 12 finalists announced Wednesday for the 2024 Class of the World Golf Hall of Fame.

            The 31-member nominating panel whittled the list down to four men, four women and four contributors. A 20-member selection panel comprising Hall of Fame members, media and leaders of major golf organizations meet on March 8 at The Players Championship to vote on induction.

            Hall of Fame induction is now every two years. The Class of 2024 will be inducted during the U.S. Open next year at Pinehurst No. 2 in North Carolina.











            Harrington was a finalist last time, the Irishman with 21 victories worldwide, most notably one stretch when he won the British Open in 2007 at Carnoustie and in 2008 at Royal Birkdale. He also became the first European in 78 years to win the PGA Championship when he won at Oakland Hills in 2008.

            Players must be 45 or older at the time of the induction to be eligible. The only eligible players with three majors or more who have not been inducted are Jamie Anderson and Bob Ferguson, both three-time British Open champions from 1877 through 1882.

            The other male players nominated as finalists were Jim Furyk, with 17 PGA Tour wins, a U.S. Open, a FedEx Cup title and nine consecutive Ryder Cup teams; the late Tom Weiskopf, the former British Open champion, golf course architect and television analyst; and Johnny Farrell, whose 22 tour wins included the 1928 U.S. Open. Farrell also was a finalist last time.

            Pepper retired in her late 30s because of back injuries, but not before capturing 17 titles on the LPGA Tour, two of them at the Nabisco Dinah Shore. She was an early spark in the Solheim Cup, and for the last two decades has worked as one of the top analysts for NBC and CBS.

            Joining her from the female division are Sandra Palmer, with 21 wins and two majors; the late Beverly Hanson, with 17 wins and three LPGA Tour majors, along with the 1950 U.S. Women's Amateur; and Cristie Kerr, who won two majors among her 20 titles on the LPGA Tour. Hanson was a finalist last time.

            Harmon is the son of former Masters champion Claude Harmon and part of one of golf's greatest teaching families. He worked with three players who reached No. 1 in the world — Greg Norman, Tiger Woods and Dustin Johnson. He reshaped Woods' swing when he went on a tear in the early 2000s and held all four majors at the same time.

            Harmon has been voted No. 1 every year since 2001 in Golf Digest's annual list of top 50 golf instructors.

            Others from the contributors category are retired Royal & Ancient chief executive Peter Dawson; former amateur great Jay Sigel, who played on nine Walker Cup teams; and the remaining seven founders of the LPGA Tour. The other six founders already have been inducted.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818701,"Yankees' Montas has surgery, could return in 2nd half","TAMPA, Fla (AP) — Frankie Montas won't start throwing until at least late May following right shoulder surgery, a timetable that could allow him to pitch for the New York Yankees in the season's second half.

            Yankees manager Aaron Boone said Wednesday the labrum of the 29-year-old right-hander was cleaned up during the procedure a day earlier with Los Angeles Dodgers head team physician Dr. Neal ElAttrache and Montas' rotator cuff did not need to be repaired. Montas won't throw for 12 weeks.

            “Everything went according to plan,” Boone said. “We're day one out of surgery, so we have a long way to go from there. We're hopeful at some point he can get back but I don't want to best case, worst case.”











            Montas was acquired from Oakland on Aug 1. and went 1-3 with a 6.35 ERA in eight starts with the Yankees. He didn’t pitch after Sept. 16 due to inflammation in his pitching shoulder.

            Montas left a July 3 start at Seattle after 13 pitches with shoulder tightness. He returned July 21 and had a 2.25 ERA in starts against Detroit and Houston.

            New York left-hander Nestor Cortes has thrown twice off a mound since being sidelined by a strained right hamstring and is nearing his first simulated game.

            Minor league catcher Ben Rortvedt had surgery Wednesday for an aneurysm of the posterior artery near his left shoulder. He had been experiencing what turned out to be a circulation problem with a finger and will not take part in baseball activities for a month.

            “Then hopefully he'll be able to start ramping up at that point,” Boone said. “Everything went well.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818702,Woman gets 4+ years in jail for harming college schoolmates,"NEW YORK (AP) — A New York woman who admitted aiding an ex-convict’s decade-long plot to extort and sexually abuse his daughter's Sarah Lawrence College schoolmates was sentenced Wednesday to over four years in prison by a judge who called her critical to his scheme.

            Isabella Pollok must report to prison by April 25 to begin serving a 4 1/2-year sentence that U.S. District Judge Lewis J. Liman said resulted from her failure to rebel against Lawrence Ray's crimes. 

            The judge said Pollok participated in “extreme and sadistic violence” in committing “extremely serious” crimes after being recruited when she was 19 and vulnerable.











            “Your role was nonetheless critical,” he said, noting she took steps to prevent a former schoolmate from escaping years of prostitution that produced millions of dollars for Ray. “You were in no means innocent.”

            Ray, 63, was sentenced last month to 60 years in prison after his conviction following a trial in which his victims described how he convinced them that they had poisoned him before forcing them to make amends by doing work for him, obeying his commands and paying him cash.

            Pollok, who pleaded guilty to a money laundering conspiracy charge last September, stood between her lawyers and sobbed as she briefly spoke before being sentenced.

            “I believed and supported someone who controlled me in ways I cannot understand. I will live with the guilt forever,"" she said through her tears. ""I badly hurt my friends and I am ashamed and deeply regret it. I am truly sorry.”

            Pollok, 31, who graduated from the Westchester County school where Ray met most of his victims, faced up to five years in prison.

            Her lawyers, who asked that she serve no prison time or receive home detention as an alternative, blamed Ray for manipulating their client after meeting her when she was near-suicidal after a childhood with a mother addicted to drugs and a father and brother in prison.

            Liman said the sentence he imposed was in part for Pollok's cruelty to a woman who Ray had forced into prostitution. The judge said she “gleefully” participated in an assault on the woman in a hotel room where, among other things, she was choked and suffocated with a plastic bag.

            Assistant U.S. Attorney Lindsey Keenan said Pollok had played an “active role” in Ray sadistic acts, including handing “him a plastic bag so he could suffocate her college friend.”

            Keenan said Pollok also kept a catalogue on her computer of video recordings of her former schoolmates in compromising sexual positions or supposedly admitting they had harmed Ray so she could retrieve the “collateral” if Ray wanted to discipline anyone.

            “The next time I see you, you will be in a jumpsuit,” the prosecutor said Pollok once wrote to the woman Ray had forced into prostitution.

            Defense attorney David Bertan said Pollok had no lifeline when she met Ray, who brainwashed her.

            He noted that the woman forced into prostitution had written to the judge requesting leniency for Pollok.

            Bertan said Pollok was rebuilding her life in part by working at an Amazon warehouse.

            “I don't see that a cult victim should have to go to jail for being in a cult,” he said.

            Outside court, Bertan said he was disappointed by the sentence.NEW YORK (AP) — A New York woman who admitted aiding an ex-convict’s decade-long plot to extort and sexually abuse his daughter's Sarah Lawrence College schoolmates was sentenced Wednesday to over four years in prison by a judge who called her critical to his scheme.Isabella Pollok must report to prison by April 25 to begin serving a 4 1/2-year sentence that U.S. District Judge Lewis J.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818704,Review: Irish Oscar nominee 'The Quiet Girl' speaks clearly,"Though gently restrained and delicately crafted, “The Quiet Girl” has managed to make plenty of noise. Colm Bairead's modestly scaled drama, his narrative directorial debut, is the highest-grossing Irish-language film of all time. It bested “Belfast” at the Irish Film & Television Awards. And it's nominated for best international film at the Academy Awards, a first for Ireland. 

            It's not hard to see why. Bairead's sensitive and heartfelt film, which is debuting in many theaters Friday, is a stirring testament to what's possible on a modest scale with a few well-chosen words. Set in 1981 rural Ireland, “The Quiet Girl” — a clever tweak to the title of John Ford's Ireland-set “The Quiet Man” — comes from Claire Keegan's short story “Foster,"" and it preserves much of the rhythm and concision of a good short story. 

             A willowy and taciturn 9-year-old, Cait (Catherine Clinch, a newcomer of staggering poise), is mostly overlooked in her cacophonous and coarse working-class family. Her mother (Kate Nic Chonaonaigh) is exhausted from raising another baby and has another on the way. Her gruff father (Michael Patric) has abandoned tending to their farm and mostly spends his time drinking and gambling. Cait's older sisters don't have much affection for her, either. “Which one is she?” someone asks her father. “The wanderer,"" he answers.











            To ease life at home, they ship Cait to her mother's cousin for the summer. The sisters don't bother saying goodbye. Her father peels out forgetting to even leave her bags. Cait's never even met the couple that takes her in: Eibhlin and Sean Cinnsealach (Carrie Crowley and Andrew Bennett), an older pair who live far more peacefully on a sun-dappled and well-tended farm. Eibhlin, played beautifully by Crowley, is immediately tender with her. 

            “If there are secrets in a house, there is shame in that house,” she tells Cait. “There are no secrets in this house.” 

            Some things go unspoken. The bedroom Cait sleeps in has train wallpaper but there's no mention of them having had a child.

            Follow AP Film Writer Jake Coyle on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/jakecoyleAPThough gently restrained and delicately crafted, “The Quiet Girl” has managed to make plenty of noise. Colm Bairead's modestly scaled drama, his narrative directorial debut, is the highest-grossing Irish-language film of all time. It bested “Belfast” at the Irish Film & Television Awards. And it's nominated for best international film at the Academy Awards, a first for Ireland.It's not hard to see why. Bairead's sensitive and heartfelt film, which is debuting in many theaters Friday, is a stirring testament to what's possible on a modest scale with a few well-chosen words. Set in 1981 rural Ireland, “The Quiet Girl” — a clever tweak to the title of John Ford's Ireland-set “The Quiet Man” — comes from Claire Keegan's short story “Foster,"" and it preserves much of the rhythm and concision of a good short story.A willowy and taciturn 9-year-old, Cait (Catherine Clinch, a newcomer of staggering poise), is mostly overlooked in her cacophonous and coarse working-class family. Her mother (Kate Nic Chonaonaigh) is exhausted from raising another baby and has another on the way. Her gruff father (Michael Patric) has abandoned tending to their farm and mostly spends his time drinking and gambling. Cait's older sisters don't have much affection for her, either. “Which one is she?” someone asks her father. “The wanderer,"" he answers.To ease life at home, they ship Cait to her mother's cousin for the summer. The sisters don't bother saying goodbye. Her father peels out forgetting to even leave her bags. Cait's never even met the couple that takes her in: Eibhlin and Sean Cinnsealach (Carrie Crowley and Andrew Bennett), an older pair who live far more peacefully on a sun-dappled and well-tended farm. Eibhlin, played beautifully by Crowley, is immediately tender with her.“If there are secrets in a house, there is shame in that house,” she tells Cait. “There are no secrets in this house.”Some things go unspoken. The bedroom Cait sleeps in has train wallpaper but there's no mention of them having had a child. Sean is initially standoffish with Cait, and you wonder if here, again, is a father-figure without any love for her. But their relationship warms and Cait falls into the daily routines of the farm and the blessed quiet harmony of their home. “The Quiet Girl” unfolds as a nurturing idyll that couldn't be sweeter even though we know it can't last forever.

            “Quarterback” is the first partnership between the league and the streaming service. NFL Films, Peyton Manning’s Omaha Productions and Mahomes’ 2PM Productions will produce the series.

            The series followed Mahomes, Cousins, and Mariota throughout the past season. It also marked the first time the NFL allowed quarterbacks to be mic’d up for every game.











            Mahomes led the Kansas City Chiefs to their second Super Bowl championship in four seasons and won MVP honors for rallying them to a 38-35 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles.

            Cousins helped lead the Minnesota Vikings to the NFC North title, including a dramatic 39-36 overtime victory over the Indianapolis Colts on Dec. 17 for the largest comeback in NFL history.

            Mariota started 13 games in his first season with the Atlanta Falcons.

            “I’m excited for fans to get an exclusive, behind-the-scenes look at an unforgettable season for the entire Chiefs organization and my family,” Mahomes said in a statement. “From welcoming home a new baby in the middle of the season to welcoming the Lombardi Trophy back to Kansas City, our crew was there for it all. This new Netflix series will show the time, preparation, and balance it takes to be an NFL quarterback and perform on the biggest stage.”

            Wednesday’s announcement is part of a busy start to the year for Netflix with sports docuseries. The tennis series “Point Break” debuted last month, and golf’s “Full Swing” premiered on Feb. 15. The fifth season of the popular “Formula 1: Drive to Survive” franchise launches on Friday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818716,California bill penalizing oil profits makes little progress,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — After gas prices in California spiked to more than $6.40 per gallon last summer, Gov. Gavin Newsom led a charge against an industry he says is “ripping you off.""

            Months later, it's not clear if California's Legislature is following him. 

            Newsom, a Democrat, called lawmakers into a rare special session in December to pass what would be the nation's first penalty on excessive oil company profits. But the bill is still sitting in the Democratic-controlled Legislature three months later, with no details on how much the penalty would be or when oil companies would have to pay it.











            The oil industry spent about $34 million lobbying the Legislature in the last two-year session and remains a powerful political force, particularly among Democrats who represent parts of the state where the industry provides jobs. The proposal would need support from a majority of lawmakers to pass.

            The bill is a big risk for Newsom, who was just reelected in November and is seen as a possible presidential candidate ahead of 2024. Newsom has embraced electric cars, ordering state regulators to ban the sale of most new gas-powered cars by 2035. But for decades gasoline is likely to continue to be a critical commodity in California, a state that has twice as many licensed drivers as any other state.

            Historically, California's gas prices have always been higher than the rest of the country because of the state's higher taxes and fees, and the special blend that gasoline regulators require because it is better for the environment.

            But state regulators say they can't explain recent price spikes like the one last summer that, at its peak, had some California commuters paying as much as $8 per gallon while oil companies recorded super-sized profits. Newsom's solution is to penalize oil companies when their profits get too high, and return that money to the public.

            During the bill's first public hearing in the state Senate on Wednesday, many Democrats were sympathetic to drivers hit by price spikes. But several Democrats appeared to be skeptical.

            “What the hell are the possible unintended consequences that could hurt those very people to a greater extent?” asked state Sen. Bill Dodd, a Democrat from Napa.

            Dodd wanted to know what would stop oil refiners from simply shipping their product to other states in order to avoid California profits that could trigger a penalty. State Sen. Steven Bradford, a Democrat from Los Angeles, wondered how the Newsom administration would return the money to the public.

            Nicolas Maduros, director of the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration, said years of data show California is one of the most profitable markets for these oil companies, meaning it wouldn't make sense for them to stop selling gasoline there. Plus, he said the Newsom administration hopes the penalty would never be needed.

            “This isn’t a tax. It's not meant to raise revenue. It's meant to change behavior,” Maduros said.

            Catherine Reheis-Boyd, president and CEO of the Western States Petroleum Association, said the real reason for California’s high gas prices is not profits but a lack of supply. She said Newsom’s proposal will only make that worse because oil companies would likely supply less gasoline in the state to avoid paying a penalty.

            “This is too important to get wrong. Let’s work toward a better way, not a political way,” she said.

            Newsom said the reason it's taking so long to advance the bill is a “lack of transparency” from the big five oil refiners, which supply nearly all of California’s gasoline. Those companies — Valero, Phillips 66, PBF Energy, Marathon and Chevron — have declined to testify during public hearings.

            “Today’s hearing provided even more evidence that we need to crack down on Big Oil’s price gouging at the pump,"" Newsom said. “Big Oil’s lobbyists again used scare tactics and refused to provide answers or solutions to last year’s price spikes.”

            The big question is how much profit would trigger the penalty. Consumer Watchdog, a nonprofit group that Newsom has frequently cited when criticizing oil companies, wants that threshold to be anytime oil company profits exceed 50 cents per gallon. 

            One way to measure that would be to look at the difference between the wholesale cost of gas and the cost of crude oil. But that calculation isn't perfect, because it doesn't include oil company operational costs, Jamie Court, the group's president, said.

            In the last 20 years, the big five oil refiners have average profits of 32 cents per gallon, Court said. The group says all of the big five refiners surpassed 50 cents in 2022. If that threshold had been law in 2022, Consumer Watchdog said it would have generated $3.3 billion in penalties.

            “The real problem we have in California is we have five refiners who make 97% of our gasoline,” Court said. “When they want to squeeze us, they can.”

            Wednesday, a panel of economists and experts — some with ties to the oil industry — mostly criticized the proposal, saying it would not likely cause gas prices to decrease. 

            Severin Borenstein, a University of California, Berkeley, business professor and expert on energy policy and fuel pricing, said drivers in the state paid $8 billion more last year than they would have if prices were in line with the rest of the country. 

            But he said lawmakers should focus more on requiring oil companies to disclose more information about pricing so regulators can better understand what's driving increases.

            “The fact is, shooting first and then finding out if it is the right solution is likely to be just as detrimental as helpful,” Borenstein said.SACRAMENTO, Calif.

            Biden considers 1st offshore wind auction in Gulf of Mexico

            The Biden administration said Wednesday it is considering the first-ever lease sale for offshore wind energy in the Gulf of Mexico, a key part of a push to deploy 30 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2030 to help fight climate change. The proposed sale, which could take place as soon as this summer, includes areas offshore Lake Charles, Louisiana and Galveston, Texas, for roughly 3.6 gigawatts of electricity, enough to power about 1.3 million homes. Scientists say dirty energy produced burning coal and gas must be replaced as fast as possible with energy that does not pollute in order to avoid extreme changes to the climate.

            Fed Minutes: Almost all officials backed quarter-point hike

            WASHINGTON (AP) — Nearly all Federal Reserve policymakers agreed earlier this month to slow the pace of their rate increases to a quarter-point, with only “a few” supporting a larger half-point hike. The minutes from the Fed’s Jan. 31-Feb.1 meeting said most of the officials supported the quarter-point increase because a slower pace “would better allow them to assess the economy’s progress” toward reducing inflation to their 2% target. The increase raised the Fed’s benchmark rate to its highest level in 15 years. It followed a half-point rate increase in December and four three-quarter-point hikes before that. The central bank’s rate hikes typically lead to more expensive mortgages, auto loans, credit card borrowing and business lending.

            Microsoft is ready to take its new Bing chatbot mainstream — less than a week after making major fixes to stop the artificially intelligent search engine from going off the rails. The company said Wednesday it is bringing the new AI technology to its Bing smartphone app, as well as the app for its Edge internet browser, though it is still requiring people to sign up for a waitlist before using it. Putting the new AI-enhanced search engine into the hands of smartphone users is meant to give Microsoft an advantage over Google, which dominates the internet search business but hasn’t yet released such a chatbot to the public.

            WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court seems skeptical of a lawsuit trying to hold social media companies responsible for a terrorist attack at a Turkish nightclub that killed 39 people. During arguments at the high court several justices underscored that there was no evidence linking Twitter, Facebook and Google directly to the 2017 attack on the Reina nightclub in Istanbul. The family of a man killed in the attack says the companies aided and abetted the attack because they assisted in the growth of the Islamic State group, which claimed responsibility for the attack . A lower court let the lawsuit go forward.

In recent years, the number of plant-based drinks has exploded to include dozens of varieties, including cashew, coconut and hemp.___G-20 finance chiefs to tackle global economic threatsBENGALURU, India (AP) — Top financial leaders from the Group of 20 leading economies are gathering in the south Indian technology hub of Bengaluru to tackle challenges to global growth and stability. India is hosting the G-20 financial conclave for the first time in 20 years. Later in the year it will convene its first summit of G-20 economies. The meetings offer the world’s second most populous country a chance to showcase its ascent as an economic power and its status as a champion of developing nations. This week’s gathering takes place just a year after Russia invaded Ukraine, setting off a cascade of shocks to the world economy, chief among them decades-high inflation.___Amazon closes $3.9B buyout of health company One MedicalNEW YORK (AP) — Amazon has closed its $3.9 billion acquisition of the primary care organization One Medical. The health company runs a membership-based service offers virtual care as well as in-person visits. And the two companies said Wednesday membership to the service will be available to new U.S. customers for $144 – a 28% discount - for the first year. The Federal Trade Commission had been doing a review of the buyout. Though it hasn’t brought forth a lawsuit to block the merger, an agency spokesperson noted its not ruling out any challenges in the future. The FTC is also reviewing Amazon’s $1.65 billion purchase of iRobot, which was announced last August.___The S&P 500 fell 81.75 points, or 2%, to 3,997.34.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818722,Astros' McCullers to miss opening day with strained muscle,"Houston Astros right-hander Lance McCullers Jr. says he will miss opening day for the World Series champions because of a strained muscle in his pitching arm.

            McCullers, sidelined for the first 4 1/2 months of last season while rehabbing from a right flexor pronator strain, noticed soreness after a bullpen session last week. 

            He had an MRI on Tuesday night. He told reporters Wednesday that it showed no structural damage to his elbow but will delay his start.











            “I've been a little bit upset,” the 29-year-old said. “I was really looking forward to a great start to the camp and a great start to the season.”

            McCullers described the injury as a “small muscle strain.""

            “It will set me back a little bit, but it shouldn't be anything like last year,” he said. “It should be something where hopefully I'm playing catch in s couple weeks.”

            Being ready for opening day, he said, “is out of the question.”

            “Because of the nature of building up through spring and the number of bullpens you need and then obviously, games, the smartest thing would be to go at a slow pace and then come back and still have the ability to throw the majority of the full season."" he said.

            McCullers missed the 2020 season following Tommy John surgery and went 13-5 with a 3.16 ERA in 2021, then was injured in the postseason. 

            He had signed an $85 million, five-year contract before the 2021 season. McCullers made eight starts from Aug. 13 on last year and was 0-1 in three postseason outings.

            TIME SAVER 

            Yankees starting pitchers Gerrit Cole, Carlos Rodón and Luis Severino along with reliever Michael King threw two innings apiece in a simulated game with a Triple-A umpire behind the plate and the new pitch clock ticking away.

            The result was each half inning averaged around two minutes shorter than in previous years. And there were only a couple violations.

            “I feel like these first few days, from that standpoint, has been a success,” Yankees manager Aaron Boone said. ""It’s something that I’ve kind of been beating them over their head with. I think that’s what was good about having an umpire here today where you can have that casual interaction and that feedback.”

            Yankees hitters included Aaron Judge, Giancarlo Stanton, Anthony Rizzo and DJ LeMahieu.

            Cole needed 35 pitches to get eight outs, allowing a single to Harrison Bader.

            King is coming back from a fractured right elbow in July that required surgery. 

            JOINING PHILLIES

            The Philadelphia Phillies say Noah Song's transfer from active duty to Navy selective reserves frees him up to join the team's spring training camp on Thursday.

            The 25-year-old from California, was taken by the Phillies in the winter meeting draft in December with hopes he would play after military service.

            The 6-foot-4, 200-pound right-hander was picked from the Boston Red Sox system in the draft for unprotected minor league players. Philadelphia put him on the military list while he continued active duty.

            Song impressed in his only pro season, making seven starts for Boston’s Class A Lowell affiliate in 2019, with a 1.06 ERA and 19 strikeouts in 17 innings. With a fastball clocked in the upper 90s mph, the right-hander dominated that year as a senior at the U.S. Naval Academy, going 11-1 with a 1.44 ERA and 161 strikeouts in 94 innings.

            BELTRÁN MUM ON CHEATING

            Carlos Beltrán talked to reporters on his first day back with the Mets organization Wednesday. But he didn't want to talk about the Houston Astros and cheating.

            Beltran joined the Mets last week as a special assistant to general manager Billy Eppler.

            On Nov. 1, 2019, Beltrán was hired by the Mets to replace Mickey Callaway as manager. But the team announced Beltrán’s departure the following Jan. 16 without him managing a game.

            Beltrán’s departure was announced three days after he was the only Astros player mentioned by name in Major League Baseball’s report that concluded that Houston broke rules by using electronics to steal signs on the way to the 2017 World Series title.

            “I felt like that was a moment that needed to happen, and I moved on,” Beltrán said.

            But that was about all he wanted to say about that.

            “Today’s not about the Astros,” Beltrán said Wednesday. “Today is about the Mets.”

            The 45-year-old Beltrán was a nine-time All-Star who played with the Mets from 2005-11 and is sixth on the team’s career list for homers (149) and RBIs (559). 

            He said he never expected to return to the team.

            “That’s how the world goes around,"" he said. ""When this opportunity came, it was a no-brainer to say yes.”

            Beltrán said several clubs offered him opportunities to be an on-field coach this season. He sees his new role as a bridge between players and the front office, helping players understand the pressure of playing in New York.

            Beltrán spent last season as a game analyst for the Yankees’ YES Network.

            WILL VOTTO BE READY?

            Reds first baseman Joey Votto is still rehabbing from last summer's shoulder and biceps surgery and may not be ready to play in the regular-season opener March 30.

            The 39-year-old Votto is in the last season of a $251.5 million, 12-year contract.

            “I have to get game reps,” he told reporters Sunday. “I need at-bats. I need game-speed reps. I haven’t come close to taking those yet. I’ve never been in this position before.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818723,States look to remove legal protections for gun industry,"DENVER (AP) — Mass shootings in America invariably raise questions of fault. The police's delayed response outside an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas. A district attorney's failure to prosecute the alleged Club Q shooter a year before five were killed in the LGBTQ nightclub.

            That finger of blame, however, rarely lands on the manufacturer of the guns used in the massacres.

            Lawmakers in Colorado and at least six other states are considering changing that, proposing bills to roll back legal protections for gun manufacturers and dealers that have kept the industry at arm's length from questions of blame. 











            California, New York, Delaware and New Jersey have passed similar legislation in the last three years.

            A draft version of Colorado's bill, expected to be introduced Thursday, not only repeals the state's 2000 law — which broadly keeps firearm companies from being held liable for violence perpetrated with their products — but also outlines a code of conduct that, in part, targets how companies design and market firearms. 

            Colorado is joined by Hawaii, New Hampshire, Virginia, Washington, New Mexico and Maryland, which are considering similar bills.

            While the firearm industry is still largely shielded from liability under federal law, the bill in Colorado would make it easier for victims of gun violence to file civil suits, such as the one lodged against Remington in 2015 — the company that made the rifle used in the the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in Connecticut. 

            Last year, Remington settled with the families of those killed in the shooting for $73 million after the families accused the company of targeting younger, at-risk males in advertising and product placement in violent video games.

            States that already have the law in place, however, are now facing legal challenges or threats of lawsuits from national gun rights groups, in part, because the federal law passed by Congress in 2005 already gives the gun industry broad legal immunity.

            “We may forget how unusual and bizarre this is to provide this exemption from accountability,"" said Ari Freilich, state policy director for the gun control advocacy group Giffords, who argues that the federal law allows states some control over the industry's legal liability.

            This bill would “empower victims of gun violence to have their day in court and be able to show that the gun industry may have failed to take reasonable precautions to avoid harm,"" Freilich said.

            Mark Oliva, managing director for public affairs at the National Shooting Sports Foundation, which has filed the lawsuits against other state's laws, said Colorado's would be “ripe” for a legal challenge if the bill passes. Oliva argues that if Coors Brewing Company shouldn't be held responsible for its customers drinking and driving, then why should gun businesses be held responsible for what their customers do?

            “The intention of this bill is to expose the firearm industry to legal costs for junk lawsuits,” Oliva said. “You don’t have Second Amendment rights if you don’t have the ability to purchase a firearm at retail to begin with.” 

            While the federal law remains intact, the Colorado bill's sponsors argue it includes carveout that gives states some degree of power. 

            The draft bill includes a stipulation for companies not to market or design a firearm in a way that could “foreseeably” promote illegal conversion — for example, advertising a semi-automatic rifle as being capable of holding a large capacity magazine, which is illegal in Colorado. 

            The current Colorado law also requires plaintiffs to pay attorneys fees if their case against a gun company is dismissed. That requirement bankrupted two parents of a woman killed in the 2012 Aurora theater shooting.

            “One of my hopes is to be able to give the Club Q victims ... the ability to at least fully participate in our Colorado judicial system,” said Rep. Sonya Jaquez Lewis, a Democrat and one of the bill's sponsors. “Just as any other victims in any other civil suit would be able to do.”

            The bill's sponsors said the legislation would merely level the playing field with other industries, such as pharmaceuticals, which don't share the gun industry's legal protections. They argue that this would not only open a path for gun violence victims, survivors and their families to find legal recourse, but also that the threat of civil lawsuits dangling over the industry’s head would force the industry's actors to police themselves. 

            “We need actors in the industry to enforce the laws for themselves, and if there is an avenue for civil liability ... (that) creates an additional incentive for them to enforce laws that are already on the books,” said Rep. Javier Mabrey, a Democrat and one of the bill's sponsors. 

            The bill will likely find Republican pushback in Colorado's majority-Democratic statehouse. Republican Rep. Mike Lynch, the Colorado House minority leader, said he hadn’t seen a draft of the bill and therefor declined to comment.

            Colorado's Senate President Steve Fenberg said, “I am excited to see this legislation come forward, and I look forward to supporting it when it reaches the Senate floor.”

            Colorado Gov. Jared Polis did not answer specific questions from The Associated Press about his position on the bill.DENVER (AP) — Mass shootings in America invariably raise questions of fault.

A district attorney's failure to prosecute the alleged Club Q shooter a year before five were killed in the LGBTQ nightclub.That finger of blame, however, rarely lands on the manufacturer of the guns used in the massacres.Lawmakers in Colorado and at least six other states are considering changing that, proposing bills to roll back legal protections for gun manufacturers and dealers that have kept the industry at arm's length from questions of blame.California, New York, Delaware and New Jersey have passed similar legislation in the last three years.A draft version of Colorado's bill, expected to be introduced Thursday, not only repeals the state's 2000 law — which broadly keeps firearm companies from being held liable for violence perpetrated with their products — but also outlines a code of conduct that, in part, targets how companies design and market firearms.Colorado is joined by Hawaii, New Hampshire, Virginia, Washington, New Mexico and Maryland, which are considering similar bills.While the firearm industry is still largely shielded from liability under federal law, the bill in Colorado would make it easier for victims of gun violence to file civil suits, such as the one lodged against Remington in 2015 — the company that made the rifle used in the the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in Connecticut.Last year, Remington settled with the families of those killed in the shooting for $73 million after the families accused the company of targeting younger, at-risk males in advertising and product placement in violent video games.States that already have the law in place, however, are now facing legal challenges or threats of lawsuits from national gun rights groups, in part, because the federal law passed by Congress in 2005 already gives the gun industry broad legal immunity.“We may forget how unusual and bizarre this is to provide this exemption from accountability,"" said Ari Freilich, state policy director for the gun control advocacy group Giffords, who argues that the federal law allows states some control over the industry's legal liability.This bill would “empower victims of gun violence to have their day in court and be able to show that the gun industry may have failed to take reasonable precautions to avoid harm,"" Freilich said.Mark Oliva, managing director for public affairs at the National Shooting Sports Foundation, which has filed the lawsuits against other state's laws, said Colorado's would be “ripe” for a legal challenge if the bill passes. Oliva argues that if Coors Brewing Company shouldn't be held responsible for its customers drinking and driving, then why should gun businesses be held responsible for what their customers do?“The intention of this bill is to expose the firearm industry to legal costs for junk lawsuits,” Oliva said. “You don’t have Second Amendment rights if you don’t have the ability to purchase a firearm at retail to begin with.”While the federal law remains intact, the Colorado bill's sponsors argue it includes carveout that gives states some degree of power.The draft bill includes a stipulation for companies not to market or design a firearm in a way that could “foreseeably” promote illegal conversion — for example, advertising a semi-automatic rifle as being capable of holding a large capacity magazine, which is illegal in Colorado.The current Colorado law also requires plaintiffs to pay attorneys fees if their case against a gun company is dismissed. That requirement bankrupted two parents of a woman killed in the 2012 Aurora theater shooting.“One of my hopes is to be able to give the Club Q victims ... the ability to at least fully participate in our Colorado judicial system,” said Rep. Sonya Jaquez Lewis, a Democrat and one of the bill's sponsors. “Just as any other victims in any other civil suit would be able to do.”The bill's sponsors said the legislation would merely level the playing field with other industries, such as pharmaceuticals, which don't share the gun industry's legal protections. They argue that this would not only open a path for gun violence victims, survivors and their families to find legal recourse, but also that the threat of civil lawsuits dangling over the industry’s head would force the industry's actors to police themselves.“We need actors in the industry to enforce the laws for themselves, and if there is an avenue for civil liability ... (that) creates an additional incentive for them to enforce laws that are already on the books,” said Rep. Javier Mabrey, a Democrat and one of the bill's sponsors.The bill will likely find Republican pushback in Colorado's majority-Democratic statehouse. Republican Rep. Mike Lynch, the Colorado House minority leader, said he hadn’t seen a draft of the bill and therefor declined to comment.Colorado's Senate President Steve Fenberg said, “I am excited to see this legislation come forward, and I look forward to supporting it when it reaches the Senate floor.”Colorado Gov. Jared Polis did not answer specific questions from The Associated Press about his position on the bill.",2023/2/23,,World

            Republican Sen. Mike Moon’s measure would add a line to the Missouri Constitution that says: “Nothing in this Constitution shall be construed to secure or protect a right to abortion.”

            “Let the voters weigh in on this,” Moon said. “They will confirm with us that life is precious, and it should not be snuffed out prematurely through abortive actions.”











            Abortion is already outlawed in Missouri. A law banning the procedure kicked in last year after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. 

            Since then, abortion-rights advocates have been talking about trying to restore access to abortion via ballot measures, although no proposals have been filed yet. 

            In Missouri, citizens can amend laws and the Missouri Constitution by going directly to voters through referendums or initiative petitions. 

            Ballot measures allow voters to sidestep lawmakers, a tool that has previously been used to address policy issues that voters disagree with the Legislature on or politically sticky issues that lawmakers refuse to take up. 

            Moon's measure would also need voter approval if it's passed by the GOP-controlled Legislature by the end of session in mid-May.

An advertising hoarding for a drinks company whose ownership model of the Saxony club circumvents the 50+1 rule which binds German football together, Leipzig's very existence threatens the fabric of German club football.In the blue corner, Manchester City: English Premier League champions in four of the last five years. Limitlessly bankrolled by the ruling family of the United Arab Emirates for the past 15 years in a thinly-veiled attempt to sportswash their malevolence away, the City Football Group have recently been accused of over 100 breaches of the Premier League's financial regulations. Ding, ding!In footballing terms, at least, this was a compelling contest. Their only previous two meetings had aggregated 12 goals, including a remarkable 6-3 win for City. Both games had seen Riyad Mahrez find the net, so it should have been little surprise that his goal would break the deadlock here – but it wasn't Josko Gvardiol's finest moment.The Croatian center-back seems destined for a big-money switch to England this summer, with City among his potential suitors. This double-header against the English champions puts him firmly in the shop window for those considering making him the world's most expensive defender. But when Jack Grealish seized on Xaver Schlager's stray pass, Gvardiol was muscled out of it by the savvy Ilkay Gündogan, allowing the ball to roll into the path of Mahrez. The Algerian did the rest.Leipzigstepped things after the break and the chances started to come; Benjamin Henrichs and Andre Silva went closest as Gvardiol and Willy Orban kept Erling Haaland at bay. It was at the other end that Gvardiol made his mark though, rising high to nod Marcel Halstenburg's header in with 20 minutes to play.The equalizer had long been coming and was no less than Leipzig deserved having raised the tempo and reducing Haaland to feeding off scraps at a stadium where he'd scored four times in his two visits with Borussia Dortmund. In fact, this was the first time he'd been to Leipzig and not scored. As much as his faltering form is a failure of City's own making, it's also testament to Leipzig sealing off the supply lines. In that regard, Konrad Laimer deserves particular praise — even if Kevin de Bruyne was denied a return to Germany due to illness.Leipzig coach Marco Rose had sent on Christopher Nkunku for the final 25 minutes and the Frenchman applied enough attacking pressure to tip the balance Leipzig's way. Even if the second goal didn't come, Leipzig did enough at both ends of the field to suggest this isn't over.City have reached the quarterfinals in each of the six seasons that Guardiola has been at the helm in Manchester but nothing is a given as an enticing second leg awaits on March 14. The gloves could come off in part two of the battle of the nomantics.",2023/2/22,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818732,Ukraine skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych working to give children hope,"Vladyslav Heraskevych focuses his mind on the ice track in Sigulda, Latvia. His gaze is fixed as he sways tensely from one leg to the other. His father and coach Mychajlo stands next to him, speaking words of encouragement to him just before the first run of the last race of the World Cup season. Then Heraskevych takes another deep breath and puts on his helmet, which has the word ""Ukraine"" emblazoned in large letters on the side.With war raging in his homeland for the past year, it has been no ordinary season for the athlete, who was born in Kyiv in 1999.""Compared to last year, it's been very hard,"" Heraskevych tells DW. ""I'm just exhausted. It's very hard to focus on competing when there's war in your homeland and people you know are fighting – and dying on the frontlines.""To loud cheers from his father, the 24-year-old gets off to a good start. Heraskevych enters the first curves of the track just a few tenths of a second behind the leaders. Unlike many of his male friends, the skeleton racer has an exemption permit, which allows him to leave Ukraine to compete for his country.""It's a platform where we can talk about Ukraine,"" he says. ""We can show that Ukraine still exists, that we are still here.""This, Heraskevych says, is what motivates him.The skeleton racer navigates the tight curves of the Latvian course at more than 100 kilometers per hour (62 miles per hour), but in the penultimate curve he drifts off the ideal line and ends up only 16th in the first run.""In the summer you usually prepare for the season. You work on your equipment and train a lot,"" Heraskevych says. ""But this time I traveled all over Ukraine for my foundation.""When he did find time to train with his father, their sessions were often interrupted by air alerts.""We'd have to go into the bunker and wait. Then we'd go back to the training hall and warm up,"" he says.But his practice sessions would often be interrupted by the air raid sirens more than once, forcing him and his father back into the bunker.""It drives you crazy when you hear the sound of the missiles. You can only hope then that one doesn't hit your home,"" he says.Heraskevych pauses for a moment and takes another deep breath. He clearly finds it difficult to talk about the situation in Ukraine.""The war has changed me, of course. I'm a different person now,"" says the athlete, who knew many people who have been killed in the conflict.""I've become cynical. If you're too emotional, it's unbearable... I used to be much more emotional; now I'm just in shock. It's like another world, a world I don't like.""In addition to training and competing, Heraskevych organizes aid deliveries to the worst-hit areas of Ukraine. In March 2022, he and his father set up a children's foundation.""At this time, it's important to make children happy because their childhood is being stolen right now,"" Heraskevych says.""Our children can tell by the sound which missile is flying through the air. They can distinguish whether it's missiles or shots from machine guns. It's very frightening.""The athlete travels across Ukraine organizing sporting events for children. In some cases, these take place in stadiums that were destroyed in the fighting. Heraskevych wants to convey the values of sport and distract from the everyday life of war. It's all about friendship, respect and togetherness.The 24-year-old recounts the first training session in Kyiv, where children from Mariupol among those taking part.""Their eyes lit up. That was great.""Now it's time for his second run; Heraskevych gathers his strength, concentrates and plunges down the ice track. This is better than his first and he makes up a bit of time, moving up four places to 12th. While it wasn't as good as he may have hoped, in his mind it was still a good competition, because it allowed him to demonstrate that Ukraine hasn't been wiped off the map.Russian and Belarusian athletes were absent from the competition, barred due to Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine. If Heraskevych had his way, it would stay that way.""I am very grateful that many organizations have suspended Russian athletes. Because this way they can no longer use sport for propaganda purposes,"" he says. He also has no understanding whatsoever for International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach's ambition to allow Russian and Belarusian athletes back into international competition.""Today, Russian athletes can murder civilians in Ukraine, and then tomorrow we welcome them at a competition? I don't want to be involved in competing against a murderer.""With the World Cup season now over, Heraskevych has finished 13th in the overall standings. But for him that is secondary. Apart from competing in several other competitions in South Korea and the United States, Heraskevych plans to train Ukrainian youth skeleton teams along with his father and to accompany them to competitions.He will be supported by German Olympic luge champion Felix Loch and his wife Lisa. Loch, co-founder of the organization ""Athletes for Ukraine,"" and Heraskevych have become friends in recent months and even spent Christmas together.Whenever possible, Loch attends the training sessions that Heraskevych organizes for Ukrainian children. It is important to support them, the Ukrainian stresses.""When I see this new generation, I have hope. They are our future. And seeing the gleam in their eyes makes me happy.""This article was translated from German.",2023/2/22,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818733,Man City held 1-1 by Leipzig in last 16 of Champions League,"LEIPZIG, Germany (AP) — Joško Gvardiol stifled the threat of Manchester City star Erling Haaland before scoring himself to earn Leipzig a 1-1 draw in the first leg of their round-of-16 matchup in the Champions League on Wednesday.

            The Croatia center back, nicknamed “Little Pep” because of the similarities of his last name with that of City manager Pep Guardiola, headed home the equalizer in the 70th minute after Leipzig finally got to grips with the English champions.

            City dominated the first half without Haaland, its top scorer, getting a sight on goal and Riyad Mahrez netted the 27th-minute opener after Ilkay Gundogan flicked through a pass from Jack Grealish.











            As Haaland grew frustrated in the second half, City lost control of the game and Leipzig posed more of a threat, creating the better of the chances.

            “What do you expect, that we are playing a friendly game here?” Guardiola said, when asked why his team was unable to retain its domination into the second half. “How many games have you seen from Leipzig? You expect us to come here and win 0-5? That is not a reality.""

            It leaves the match in the balance heading into the second leg in Manchester on March 14 as City continues its bid for a first Champions League title.

            Guardiola conducted a mini-debrief with his players on the field after the final whistle, telling them to stay positive after seeing them throw away their advantage after a first-half performance that could have led to more than just Mahrez’s 20th Champions League goal.

            Haaland had only seven touches before halftime — none of them coming in Leipzig’s penalty area — and he had only one opportunity in the whole match, when he got free down the right midway through the second half and snatched at a shot that dribbled wide.

            Leipzig’s extra intensity and aggression paid off as the German team, a Champions League semifinalist in 2020, finally showed why it had lost just one of its 20 previous matches in all competitions.

            “We started to play, to fight,” Leipzig coach Marco Rose said. ""Really different to the first half. We were too passive in every situation. We had no power. In the second half, we were the same level (as City). Better late than never.”

            Benjamin Henrichs, who came on as a halftime substitute, side-footed wide when he was one on one with goalkeeper Ederson, who got down well to deny Andre Silva.

            However, Ederson was left stranded when Marcel Halstenberg swung over a left-wing cross and 21-year-old Gvardiol — one of the best defenders at last year's World Cup and among Europe's most sought-after young players — got above Ruben Dias to nod the ball into an unguarded net.

            There was a bizarre incident in the final seconds when Mahrez curled a cross into the area and a header from City midfielder Rodri appeared to be punched away by Henrichs as he defended his body with both arms. City's players appealed for a penalty but the referee was unmoved.

            When Leipzig last visited City's Etihad Stadium, it was routed 6-3 in a wild group-stage game in the Champions League last season. Christopher Nkunku scored a hat trick for Leipzig on that night and the France striker came on as a substitute in the second half, stepping up his sharpness after a left knee injury sustained in training in November just before flying out to the World Cup.

            Nkunku might be fit to start the second leg when City should have Kevin De Bruyne available again. The playmaker was absent on Wednesday because of an illness.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818734,Connecticut poised to pay $12 million to settle neglect case,"HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — Connecticut is poised to pay $12 million to settle a case involving a neglected 14-month-old boy who was placed by the state's child welfare agency in 2015 with a relative who had allegations of abuse. The boy ended up severely malnourished and physically abused.

            The proposed legal settlement comes a year after the Connecticut Department of Children of Families was finally released from three decades of federal oversight.

            Michael Williams, deputy commissioner of operations at the agency, tried to assure members of the General Assembly's Judiciary Committee on Wednesday that the placement of “Baby Dylan,” who is now eight years old and suffers from complex medical and developmental issues, does not reflect the agency's policies then or now. 











            “We're totally embarrassed by the practice that occurred on this case. It does not in any way, shape or form represent the standard of practice that we had adhered to then and adhere to now,"" said Williams, who said the staff involved in the case “chose to cut corners” and that decision led to the boy being harmed. 

            Williams referred to the situation as a “dump and run,” not representing anything close to the agency's standards for placing a child in so-called kinship foster care, a program that aims to keep at-risk children with family members rather than strangers. 

            The agency, represented by the Connecticut Attorney General's Office, is seeking legislative approval of the settlement reached with lawyers for boy's adoptive parents. While Judiciary Committee members on Wednesday approved identical House and Senate bills authorizing the settlement, sending them to both chambers for final action, they made it clear they are not happy with the agency or the prospect of paying out such a large legal settlement.

            “On the one hand, we as a state have to step up and take responsibility for what one of our state agencies did not do and that is to perform their job without clear negligence,” said Sen. John Kissel, a Republican from Enfield. “On the other hand, as a member of this committee, one of my jobs is to make sure taxpayers' dollars are used wisely.”

            Eileen Meskill, deputy attorney general, told lawmakers that while the state rarely admits liability, it became clear through investigations that this case was particularly egregious, and the state could be liable for as much as $20 million.

            Department of Children of Families officials had removed the boy from his parents' care because of neglect issues and placed him with the cousin of the boy's mother, without seeking information about the woman's background, which included a criminal history and past allegations of neglect, Meskill said. The woman also had “widespread warning signs,” including failing to complete Department of Children of Families foster licensing requirements or agree to drug testing. She also contacted police about the boy's inconsolable crying and complained to Department of Children of Families workers that she was overwhelmed.

            Ultimately, the boy was removed five months later and placed with another relative, who brought the child to the emergency room where he was found to have multiple healed scars and wounds to his feet, untreated broken bones in both arms and a retinal hemorrhage, Meskill said. The boy was also unable to talk or feed himself, suffered from severe malnutrition and showed evidence of a traumatic brain injury. 

            The cousin was ultimately arrested and pleaded guilty to risk of injury to a minor. 

            The state Attorney General's office said the full legislature has the opportunity to reject the settlement, but legislators do not need to affirmatively approve it. They have 30 days from submission, which was Feb. 1.HARTFORD, Conn.

It does not in any way, shape or form represent the standard of practice that we had adhered to then and adhere to now,"" said Williams, who said the staff involved in the case “chose to cut corners” and that decision led to the boy being harmed.Williams referred to the situation as a “dump and run,” not representing anything close to the agency's standards for placing a child in so-called kinship foster care, a program that aims to keep at-risk children with family members rather than strangers.The agency, represented by the Connecticut Attorney General's Office, is seeking legislative approval of the settlement reached with lawyers for boy's adoptive parents. While Judiciary Committee members on Wednesday approved identical House and Senate bills authorizing the settlement, sending them to both chambers for final action, they made it clear they are not happy with the agency or the prospect of paying out such a large legal settlement.“On the one hand, we as a state have to step up and take responsibility for what one of our state agencies did not do and that is to perform their job without clear negligence,” said Sen. John Kissel, a Republican from Enfield. “On the other hand, as a member of this committee, one of my jobs is to make sure taxpayers' dollars are used wisely.”Eileen Meskill, deputy attorney general, told lawmakers that while the state rarely admits liability, it became clear through investigations that this case was particularly egregious, and the state could be liable for as much as $20 million.Department of Children of Families officials had removed the boy from his parents' care because of neglect issues and placed him with the cousin of the boy's mother, without seeking information about the woman's background, which included a criminal history and past allegations of neglect, Meskill said. The woman also had “widespread warning signs,” including failing to complete Department of Children of Families foster licensing requirements or agree to drug testing. She also contacted police about the boy's inconsolable crying and complained to Department of Children of Families workers that she was overwhelmed.Ultimately, the boy was removed five months later and placed with another relative, who brought the child to the emergency room where he was found to have multiple healed scars and wounds to his feet, untreated broken bones in both arms and a retinal hemorrhage, Meskill said. The boy was also unable to talk or feed himself, suffered from severe malnutrition and showed evidence of a traumatic brain injury.The cousin was ultimately arrested and pleaded guilty to risk of injury to a minor.The state Attorney General's office said the full legislature has the opportunity to reject the settlement, but legislators do not need to affirmatively approve it. They have 30 days from submission, which was Feb. 1.",2023/2/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818735,Late Lukaku goal helps Inter beat Porto 1-0 in Champs League,"MILAN (AP) — Romelu Lukaku is back.

            After ending his goalscoring drought last weekend, Lukaku scored late to fire Inter Milan to a 1-0 win over 10-man Porto on Wednesday in the first leg of their Champions League round-of-16 matchup.

            They were Lukaku’s first goals since October and took his tally to just four since returning from Chelsea in the offseason as the Belgium forward has struggled with injury and poor form.











            “We’re really happy with the win, it was too important to get a result,” said Lukaku, who came on as a substitute. “We wanted to score a second goal too, but we still managed to win the match and I’m happy.

            “I went through really difficult months with the injury but I’m happy to be available again and happy to have helped get the win. I’m not individualistic, I only think about Inter, about doing the best for Inter.”

            Porto midfielder Otávio was sent off following a second yellow card 12 minutes from time. He had received his first booking for a tussle with Inter's Federico Dimarco at the end of the first half.

            The second leg is on March 14 in Porto.

            “I think it (the second yellow) was right, but the last 10 minutes were difficult for us,” Porto coach Sérgio Conceição said. “But there were also Inter players that deserved to be booked. Lautaro (Martínez) should have got a yellow card and he wouldn’t have played the return leg if he had … I don’t know if that was right, you decide.”

            Inter has lost only once since the beginning of November, while Porto came into the match on a 22-game unbeaten run and had only let in two goals in its past 11 matches.

            Martínez was on a red-hot scoring streak but in the 13th minute he headed over the bar from point-blank range.

            Inter went closer five minutes later but Porto goalkeeper Diogo Costa reacted swiftly to punch Hakan Çalhanoğlu’s cross-shot out from under the bar.

            Porto withstood the Inter pressure well and had a chance of its own in the 27th minute but Marko Grujić fired over the bar.

            The visitors then had two opportunities in quick succession as Inter goalkeeper André Onana parried Grujić’s effort and Galeno nodded the rebound wide.

            The best chance — and the best save — of the half came in stoppage time as a free kick was whipped in from the right and Alessandro Bastoni seemed certain to score by the near post but Diogo Costa pushed his header away with his forearm.

            It was Onana’s turn for heroics at the start of the second half with a double save to deny first Mehdi Taremi and then Zaidu.

            Lukaku replaced Edin Džeko in the 58th and went close to breaking the deadlock but his cross-shot flashed past Martínez’s outstretched leg and the far post.

            However, Lukaku then scored with four minutes remaining. His header from Nicolò Barella’s cross came off the left post but he tucked away the rebound.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818736,US gets OK for cattle-shooting operation in New Mexico,"ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) — A U.S. district judge on Wednesday cleared the way for federal officials to move ahead with plans to take to the air and shoot dozens of wild cattle in a rugged area of southwestern New Mexico.

            Ranchers had sought a delay, arguing that the potential mass slaughter of as many as 150 “unauthorized” cows on public land was a violation of federal regulations and amounted to animal cruelty. 

            After listening to arguments that stretched throughout the day, Judge James Browning denied the request, saying the ranchers failed to make their case. He also said the U.S. Forest Service is charged with managing the wilderness for the benefit of the public, and the operation would further that aim.











            “No one disputes that the Gila cattle need to be removed and are doing significant damage to the Gila Wilderness,” Browning wrote. “The court does not see a legal prohibition on the operation. It would be contrary to the public interest to stop the operation from proceeding.”

            Plans by the Forest Service call for shooting the cattle with a high-powered rifle from a helicopter and leaving the carcasses in the Gila Wilderness. It was estimated by attorneys for the ranchers that 65 tons of dead animals would be left in the forest for months until they decompose or are eaten by scavengers. 

            Officials closed a large swath of the forest Monday and were scheduled to begin the shooting operation Thursday.

            The New Mexico Cattle Growers' Association, individual ranchers and the Humane Farming Association filed a complaint in federal court Tuesday, alleging that agency officials were violating their own regulations and overstepping their authority.

            The complaint stated that court intervention was necessary to put an immediate stop to “this unlawful, cruel, and environmentally harmful action, both now and in the future.”

            The ranchers had argued that the case could set a precedent for how federal officials handle unbranded livestock on vacant allotments or deal with other land management conflicts across the West.

            “There’s a severe danger here, not just in this particular case and the horrific results that it will actually bare if this is allowed to go forward. But it also has long-term ramifications for the power of federal agencies to disregard their regulations that they themselves passed,” Daniel McGuire, an attorney for the ranchers, told the judge. 

            The Gila National Forest issued its final decision to gun down the wayward cattle last week amid pressure from environmental groups that have raised concerns that cattle are compromising water quality and habitat for other species as they trample stream banks in sensitive areas.

            Much of the debate during Wednesday's hearing centered on whether the animals were unauthorized livestock or feral cows, as the Forest Service has been referring to them.

            Ranchers said the cattle in question were the descendants of cows that legally grazed the area in the 1970s before the owner went out of business. They pointed to DNA and genetic markers, saying the temperament of the animals doesn't mean they cease to be domesticated livestock. 

            As defined in Forest Service regulations, unauthorized livestock refers to any cattle, sheep, goats or hogs that are not authorized by permit to be grazing on national forest land. The regulations calls for an impoundment order to be issued and the livestock rounded up, with lethal action being a final step for those that aren't captured.

            Despite issuing such an order earlier this month, the agency argued it wasn't required to follow the removal procedures outlined by the regulations because the cattle don't fit the definition of livestock since they aren't domesticated or being kept or raised by any individual.

            Government attorney Andrew Smith said the cows have no pedigree.

            “So it does make a difference what these cows are. They're multigenerations of wildness going on,” he said.

            The judge agreed.

            Smith also argued that Congress has charged the Forest Service with protecting national forest land and that eradicating the cattle would put an end to decades of damage. He said previous gathering efforts over the decades only put a dent in the population but that an aerial shooting operation in 2022 was able to take out 65 cows in two days.

            Had the project been delayed, Smith suggested that the population would rebound and last year's effort would be wasted.

            McGuire countered that Congress conferred authority on the Forest Service to make rules and regulations to protect and preserve the forest, not a license for the agency to do anything it wants.ALBUQUERQUE, N.M.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818737,Court: News outlets didn't defame ex-coal CEO Blankenship,"CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) — Fox News, CNN and other major news outlets didn't defame former coal executive Don Blankenship when they referred to him as a “felon” after he served a year in prison on a misdemeanor charge in connection with the worst U.S. mine disaster in decades, a federal appeals court ruled Wednesday. 

            Fourth Circuit Court Chief Judge Roger Gregory affirmed a district court's determination that 16 outlets sued by Blankenship did not act with “actual malice"" amid coverage of his unsuccessful 2018 U.S. Senate campaign, even if they failed to meet journalistic standards.

            ""Failure to fact-check is not enough to manufacture a genuine issue of actual malice here,” Gregory wrote.











            The chief judge said Blankenship's arguments are “mostly speculative and do not come close to the quantum of evidence needed to create a jury question.” 

            Blankenship couldn't be immediately reached for comment. His attorney didn’t return email and phone messages, and an email sent to an account listed for Blankenship could not be delivered. He did not respond to a direct message sent to him on Twitter. 

            The former CEO of Massey Energy, which owned West Virginia’s Upper Big Branch Mine where a 2010 explosion killed 29 workers, was indicted on several federal charges in the wake of the disaster, including multiple felony counts.

            A jury ultimately acquitted him of the felony charges, but Blankenship was sentenced to one year in federal prison — the statutory maximum — on a misdemeanor charge for conspiring to violate federal mine safety laws. He was also fined $250,000. 

            Blankenship was released from prison in 2017. While still on supervised release in January 2018, Blankenship announced his plans to run as a Republican for U.S. Senate in West Virginia.

            During Blankenship’s Senate campaign, numerous media organizations and journalists broadcast or published statements that referred to him as a “felon” or “convicted felon,” even though Blankenship’s conviction was classified as a misdemeanor.

            The appeal before the Fourth Circuit court involved 16 of those organizations: Fox News, MSNBC, CNN, the Washington Post, ABC, News & Guts, Eli Lehrer, Mediaite, Tamar Auber, Griffin Connolly, FiscalNote, HD Media, NBCUniversal, CNBC, 35th PAC and the Boston Globe. 

            The court determined that journalists were confused about the meaning of the term “felon,” which by definition refers to someone convicted of a felony. Although Blankenship was not a “felon,” he was sentenced to serve a one-year sentence in federal prison — a rarity for a misdemeanor offense.

            “Blankenship’s prison sentence placed him as close to felony status as possible,” Gregory said, adding that for “non-lawyers” describing Blankenship as a felon was not “inherently improbable,” and there were not “obvious reasons to doubt the veracity” of such a statement.

            “Some of the statements may have been the product of carelessness and substandard journalistic methods,” the chief judge wrote. “But at the end of the day, the record does not contain evidence that the commentators and journalists responsible for the statements were anything more than confused about how to describe a person who served a year in prison for a federal offense.” 

            The Richmond-based court also upheld the lower court's decision to side with the news organizations against Blankenship’s false light invasion of privacy and civil conspiracy claims, again saying he lacked sufficient evidence.CHARLESTON, W.Va.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818738,Ohio plan aims to boost trust by standardizing election data,"COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose unveiled legislation Wednesday that would clarify and standardize the way election data is organized, stored and shared across the state, a proposal that the Republican says can serve as a national model in addressing the “crisis of confidence” in American elections.

            “It's a question of, ‘Do we even all speak the same language about what constitutes a registered voter, what constitutes a voted ballot?’” LaRose, the state's elections chief, said during a Statehouse news conference. “All of these kinds of things are various, not only across Ohio's 88 counties, but across the 50 states, and the really thousands of jurisdictions that conduct elections in this country.""

            The Data Analysis Transparency Archive Act, sponsored by GOP state Sen. Theresa Gavarone, would codify standard definitions of key election data points, mandate the transfer of that data from county election boards to a new state Office of Data Analytics and Archives and empower that office to analyze and organize the information and publish it online. 











            “Having good data to help clean the voter rolls will make it even tougher to cheat, and result in better elections and improved voter confidence,” Gavarone said.

            The definitions contained in the legislation were developed in cooperation with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Data Lab, and drafting help came from the America First Policy Institute, a think tank advancing former President Donald Trump’s public policy priorities, LaRose said.

            Trump's refusal to accept the results of the 2020 presidential election has helped fuel the culture of skepticism, paranoia and conspiracy theories currently enveloping U.S. elections. In that contest's immediate aftermath, Trump and his allies zeroed in on voting systems and claimed without evidence that they had been manipulated to steal the election from him. This led to attempts across the country to examine voting equipment and voter data, but there is no evidence of any widespread voter fraud or tampering with election equipment. 

            LaRose said passing the DATA Act, which he is also promoting among secretaries in other states, could be an ""antidote to (the) falsehoods.""

            “I would put forth the supposition that, when people look behind the curtain, what they're going to see is how well-run our elections are,” he said. “The problem is that the current ambiguity, the current lack of transparency in some ways, breeds those conspiracy theories that are often not based in reality.”

            Voter advocates have cited the exceptional accuracy rate of Ohio’s elections in opposing many of the sweeping election law changes recently seen in the state, including a strict photo ID law that Gavarone championed last year. The senator said it is her view that “if we’re not actively working on ways to improve our elections, then we’ll move backwards and we’re just asking for trouble.” 

            Jen Miller, executive director of the League of Women Voters of Ohio, said her organization needs to review the legislation before taking a position. The proposal appears on its surface to align with calls they've been making for years for uniform data collection and dissemination among Ohio's county boards of elections“ so that we can better understanding voting trends and voter needs.”

            Still, Miller said she remains cautious.

            “Unfortunately, the legislation that we have seen passed most recently has not been based on the actual needs of voters or boards of elections,"" she said. “So, we are skeptical that legislation will be passed that will truly make the election system better without having robust input from voter advocates, which it doesn’t appear they’re seeking to get.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818739,Inconsistent Penguins scrambling as stretch run looms,"PITTSBURGH (AP) — The faces around Sidney Crosby, Evgeni Malkin and Kris Letang have changed over the years.

            Coaches have come and gone. General managers, a litany of players — some of them forever etched in Pittsburgh Penguins lore, others not-so much — and owners too. 

            Yet Crosby, Malkin and Letang have remained. Through heartache and triumph. M ilestones and giddy early summer parades along packed downtown streets, the Stanley Cup in tow.











            They are the fulcrum around which the organization revolves, their presence in the NHL playoffs practically a given for 16 years and counting.

            Yet nearly three-quarters of the way through their 17th season together, the group known simply as “The Big Three” finds itself in practically uncharted territory: scrambling to stay in the midst of a playoff chase.

            The Penguins enter play on Thursday against Connor McDavid and Edmonton on the outside of the top eight in the Eastern Conference looking in. 

            And while there is plenty of time for Pittsburgh to right itself, the reality is the Penguins have rarely looked as beatable during the Crosby/Malkin/Letang era as they have over the past five middling and maddening months.

            The latest proof came in a frustrating 4-2 loss to the New York Islanders on Monday night, a game in which the Penguins dominated play for the first 45-plus minutes only to crumble down the stretch on their way to a ninth straight loss to a Metropolitan Division rival.

            The setback marked the sixth time in 14 games the Penguins lost after leading through two periods. A team long known for its ability to finish has become vulnerable to late lapses that have cost them precious points in the standings.

            “I mean, it’s not ideal when you lose games and you have leads but the only way out of it is to find a way to win one and try to get some momentum from that,” Crosby said. “We can’t dwell on it.”

            Mostly because there's no time.

            The NHL's oldest roster finds itself facing a daunting sprint down the stretch. Pittsburgh will play its final 26 games in the span of 50 days. Not ideal for a group that save for a brilliant 14-2-2 run from Nov. 9-Dec. 15 has been ordinary at best. 

            While it's not the first time during the Penguins' streak of 16 straight playoff appearances that they have looked iffy as March looms, it may be the first time their options to rectify things have been so limited.

            There are no young legs ready to come up from their American Hockey League affiliate in Wilkes-Barre/Scranton as Jake Guentzel, Bryan Rust and Conor Sheary did in 2015-16, an arrival that coincided with a dash to the franchise's third Stanley Cup.

            And there may be little in the way of reinforcements coming at the trade deadline. The players the Penguins have that are considered the most attractive to other clubs are the same players they can't succeed without, and general manager Ron Hextall has a very different mandate than his predecessor, Jim Rutherford.

            Where “Trader Jim” moved the parts around Crosby, Malkin and Letang frequently in search of a mix that worked, Hextall has been far more deliberate in his approach. He's loathe — publicly anyway — to trade Pittsburgh's first-round pick in this year's draft as Pittsburgh keeps an eye toward the post-Big Three Era.

            That's left Hextall in a tight spot as he attempts to fix a top-heavy team that for all of its star power is deeply flawed. The top two lines are fine. It's what happens when the 35-year-old Crosby and the 36-year-old Malkin — both of whom are averaging a point a game — aren’t on the ice that's the issue.

            The third line of Jeff Carter, Kasperi Kapanen and a rotating group that has included Drew O'Connor and Brock McGinn has made little if any impact, a far cry from the vaunted “HBK” line of Carl Hagelin, Nick Bonino and Phil Kessel that made the Penguins one of the deepest teams in the NHL during their back-to-back Stanley Cups in 2016-17. 

            The goaltending behind starter Tristan Jarry has been spotty at best and Jarry looked rusty against the Islanders in his return from a monthlong absence because of a lower-body injury. Even a power play that features two players with more than 2,600 combined career points is decidedly average.

            Still coach Mike Sullivan, who signed a contract extension last fall, remains optimistic his team is close to figuring it out. His mantra of “playing the right way” hasn't changed much from the day he was hired in December 2015.

            Asked if there's concern that Sullivan's message may not be impactful as it once was, Hextall shook his head.

            “I think Sully is a terrific coach,” Hextall said when he last spoke to reporters earlier this month. “I would put him up against any coach in the league and if there’s any players that are not responding to him, I would look to move those players.""

            Maybe, but barring something drastic, Pittsburgh will head into the final seven weeks of the season with essentially the same group that has flip-flopped between electric and erratic since October. It means the answers to what is ailing one of the league's marquee franchises will likely have to come from within. 

            “There’s a lot of belief in here,” Crosby said. “It hasn’t gone our way lately but this is when you get tested as a group and you’ve got to make sure you respond the right way.”

            The clock is ticking.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818744,"How Biden asylum rule affects immigration, compares to Trump","WASHINGTON (AP) — As President Joe Biden's administration prepares for the end of regulations tied to the coronavirus pandemic that have severely limited the ability of asylum seekers to enter the U.S., it has proposed a rule that could dramatically alter who's allowed to claim asylum at the southern border. This rule comes as Biden is under intense criticism from Republicans intent on making immigration a key issue in the next election. Some of the president's immigration stances, including this rule, have sparked criticism from immigration advocates and even Democratic allies.

            A look at the rule: 

            WHAT'S THE NEW RULE AND HOW DOES IT COMPARE TO WHAT TRUMP DID? 











            
                The rule was announced Tuesday and will be formally published Thursday. It will generally deny asylum to migrants who show up at the southern border without first seeking protection in a country they passed through. The rule generally requires people to use what the administration calls “lawful, safe and orderly pathways” — such as applying for an asylum appointment through a smartphone app or country-specific humanitarian parole programs — to get to the U.S. However, children are exempt. 

            Critics say this is essentially reproducing some of the worst policies of former President Donald Trump, who tried numerous ways to limit migration. Melissa Crow, a lawyer with the Center for Gender & Refugee Studies, called the proposal a “mashup” of two things Trump tried: barring people from entering the country between ports of entry and making migrants ineligible for asylum if they passed through another country before getting to the U.S. and didn't apply for protection there.

            Crow said the biggest difference between the Biden proposal and the Trump transit rule was that under Trump, people were automatically ineligible for asylum. Under the Biden proposal, it's a “rebuttable presumption of ineligibility for asylum” and some exceptions are allowed. But she called those exceptions “narrow” and said ultimately U.S. law allows people to apply for asylum at the border.

            WHAT DOES THE ADMINISTRATION SAY? 

            The administration essentially described this rule as a necessary tool for when the pandemic-era restrictions called Title 42 end. Title 42 is shorthand for immigration restrictions put in place at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic to limit the disease's spread. 

            The administration says once Title 42 goes away, daily encounters between border officials and migrants attempting to enter the U.S. on the southern border could rise as high as 13,000. They compare that with the less than 1,600 daily encounters seen from 2014 to 2019. Without this rule, they say immigration would “increase significantly, to a level that risks undermining the ... continued ability to safely, effectively and humanely enforce and administer U.S. immigration law.""

            They emphasize that this is temporary — it's supposed to run for two years — and that at the same time they're offering legal pathways for people to get to the U.S. Specifically, the rule repeatedly mentions a program announced in January that allows people from four countries — Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela — the opportunity to come to the U.S. as well as a smartphone app that migrants can use to request an appointment at the border to present their asylum case. All of this, they argue, differentiates what they're doing from Trump policy.

            The administration has described its strategy as a carrot and stick approach but critics say it's not enough carrot. Krish O'Mara Vignarajah, president and CEO of Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, said they applaud the expanded pathways for those four countries announced in January but question where that leaves migrants from other countries. She says it favors people with resources who can afford the necessary requirements of finding a financial sponsor and buying a plane ticket to the U.S. And some people are so at risk, they simply cannot wait in their country for a humanitarian parole slot. Critics have also highlighted technological problems with the app.

            The rule also faced criticism from the right. The Federation for American Immigration Reform said in a statement that the rule isn't designed to halt migrants as much as make the process more orderly: “In other words, the real objective is not to end large-scale asylum abuse, but rather to get them through the next election cycle.”

            WHAT'S MEXICO'S ROLE IN THIS? 

            The U.S. shares a roughly 2,000-mile-long southern border with Mexico, and the hundreds of thousands of people who try to get asylum at the southern border every year have to pass through at least some portion of Mexico to get to the U.S. All that means that if the U.S. wants to keep people from entering the U.S. it clearly would be better to have Mexico's help.

            The U.S. said in the rule it was in “close consultation” with the Mexican government and “other foreign partners"" to accept the return of third-country nationals once Title 42 use goes away. The U.S. also said the Mexican government's decision to start taking back nationals from the four countries in January was also partly contingent on the U.S. creating new processes for people from these countries to actually get to the U.S. without taking the dangerous land journey. 

            So far Mexico has not commented on the proposal. 

            This rule wouldn’t affect Mexicans because they don’t have to pass through a third country to get to the U.S. 

            WHAT ABOUT OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE REGION? 

            The rule generally denies asylum to migrants who come to the southern border without first seeking protection in a country they passed through. The rule highlights work the U.S. has done to improve legal migration in other countries across the western hemisphere and touts asylum successes in Mexico, Belize, Costa Rica, Colombia and Ecuador. Mexico, for example, has emerged as one of the “top countries receiving asylum applications in the world.” Ecuador is currently hosting more than 500,000 people displaced from crisis-ridden Venezuela, the rule notes. 

            But immigration advocates contend that other countries don't always offer the same protections that the U.S. does. 

            WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?

            Once the rule is published, there's a 30-day comment period before it can become final. The rule goes into effect when Title 42 goes away. That is expected May 11. But the fate of Title 42 has pingponged over the last year as Republican-leaning states have sought to keep it in place through lawsuits, so it's not a guarantee that Title 42 will go away come May 11. Immigration advocates have indicated they'll sue if and when this Biden administration rule goes into effect. And they're planning to flood the Federal Register with comments opposing it.

            But Elizabeth Taufa of the Immigrant Legal Resource Center said the fact that the administration used the 30-day comment period, instead of the more traditional 60-day comment period that she'd expect for such a substantive change, indicates that the rule is unlikely to change. 

            It's a “good indication that they're dug in on this,” she said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818745,Off-duty police officer shot and wounded in Northern Ireland,"LONDON (AP) — An off-duty police officer was shot Wednesday in Northern Ireland, where paramilitary groups have previously attacked members of the security services.

            The Police Service of Northern Ireland said the officer was injured in a shooting at a sports complex in Omagh, about 60 miles (96 kilometers) west of Belfast. The force said the officer was taken to a hospital. There was no immediate word on his condition.

            More than 3,000 people were killed during three decades of violence in Northern Ireland involving Irish republican and British loyalist paramilitaries and U.K. security forces.











            The 1998 Good Friday peace accord largely ended the conflict, known as “the Troubles.” Major Catholic and Protestant paramilitary groups gave up violence and disarmed, but small Irish Republican Army splinter groups continued to mount sporadic attacks.

            Politicians from both sides of Ireland’s political divide condemned the shooting.

            Jeffrey Donaldson, leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, condemned “the cowards” behind the attack.

            “These terrorists have nothing to offer and they must be brought to justice,” he said.

            Michelle O’Neill, vice president of Irish republican party Sinn Fein, said she condemned “this reprehensible attempt to murder a police officer.”

            Colm Eastwood of the Irish nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party said the shooting was “a chilling reminder of the horrifying violence that criminal gangs are willing to visit on the people of Northern Ireland.”

            “It is a moment for us all, one community and one people, to say we are never going back to this – not in our name,” he said.

            Omagh is the site of Northern Ireland’s deadliest attack, an August 1998 car bombing that killed 29 people. A dissident republican group called the Real IRA claimed responsibility for that attack,LONDON (AP) — An off-duty police officer was shot Wednesday in Northern Ireland, where paramilitary groups have previously attacked members of the security services.The Police Service of Northern Ireland said the officer was injured in a shooting at a sports complex in Omagh, about 60 miles (96 kilometers) west of Belfast. The force said the officer was taken to a hospital. There was no immediate word on his condition.More than 3,000 people were killed during three decades of violence in Northern Ireland involving Irish republican and British loyalist paramilitaries and U.K. security forces.The 1998 Good Friday peace accord largely ended the conflict, known as “the Troubles.” Major Catholic and Protestant paramilitary groups gave up violence and disarmed, but small Irish Republican Army splinter groups continued to mount sporadic attacks.Politicians from both sides of Ireland’s political divide condemned the shooting.Jeffrey Donaldson, leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, condemned “the cowards” behind the attack.“These terrorists have nothing to offer and they must be brought to justice,” he said.Michelle O’Neill, vice president of Irish republican party Sinn Fein, said she condemned “this reprehensible attempt to murder a police officer.”Colm Eastwood of the Irish nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party said the shooting was “a chilling reminder of the horrifying violence that criminal gangs are willing to visit on the people of Northern Ireland.”“It is a moment for us all, one community and one people, to say we are never going back to this – not in our name,” he said.Omagh is the site of Northern Ireland’s deadliest attack, an August 1998 car bombing that killed 29 people.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818747,Cards' Gannon turns to 29-year-old Rallis to lead defense,"TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) — The NFL is a place where 20-somethings are usually playing on the field or just breaking into the coaching profession, with titles such as “quality control” as they try to slowly rise through the ranks of a professional staff.

            It's safe to say Nick Rallis was a fast learner.

            
                New Cardinals head coach Jonathan Gannon has added the 29-year-old Rallis as the team's defensive coordinator, betting that his energy, talent and vision can negate any lack of experience.











            “Experience is not synonymous with knowledge,” Rallis said. 

            “Correct,” Gannon answered, grinning. “It's like he knows me.”

            Gannon and Rallis do know each other well, working together on the Philadelphia Eagles' staff over the past two seasons. Gannon was the defensive coordinator while Rallis was the linebackers coach. 

            Together, they helped craft an Eagles defense that was among the best in the NFL as the team reached the Super Bowl.

            Gannon and Rallis share the same philosophy in that their defense doesn't necessarily have a set formation or scheme. The head coach said the plan is that Rallis will call the defensive plays during games.

            “It's about being adaptable to the players that you have,” Rallis said. “Being able to utilize our guys’ skillsets, putting them in the best position to win games. Ultimately, what do we have to do on a week-to-week basis to beat the opponent?”

            The 40-year-old Gannon — fairly young by NFL head coaching standards —has not been afraid to surround himself with younger coaches on his first staff. The Cardinals have also hired 35-year old Drew Petzing as offensive coordinator. 

            Petzing was the quarterbacks coach of the Cleveland Browns last season.

            “In Philly, we were part of I think the youngest staff in the NFL, but that's not why I'm hiring the people I'm hiring,” Gannon said. “It's more of what I'm looking for in the hiring process.”

            Rallis, who will turn 30 this summer before the Cardinals first game, helped lead an Eagles defense that easily led the NFL with a franchise single-season record of 70 sacks. No other team in the NFL had more than 55.

            Now the new defensive coordinator inherits a Cardinals defense that has some good young players, including safeties Budda Baker and Jalen Thompson, along with linebackers Isaiah Simmons and Zaven Collins. 

            Rallis had particularly high praise for Baker, a two-time All-Pro who has anchored Arizona's defense over the past six seasons.

            “Budda sets the standard for how you play this game,” Rallis said. “It is violent, it's high motor, 24/7. 

            ""I'm just picking out one guy, there's all kinds of guys on this defense who play to that standard. And we're going to push to demand to push that even further, for everyone to be at that standard.”

            The Cardinals are in the midst of a franchise makeover after a dreadful 4-13 season. The team fired fourth-year head coach Kliff Kingsbury and parted ways with GM Steve Keim, replacing the pair with Gannon and Monti Ossenfort.

            Rallis still might not be the biggest star in his family. 

            His older brother Mike is better known these days as WWE star “Madcap Moss”, who was among the wrestlers in the mix for WWE’s recent Royal Rumble event. Rallis and his brother played college football together at Minnesota.

            “I get to flip on the TV every Friday night and watch a little ‘Smackdown,'” Rallis said.

            Then Gannon turned to his new defensive coordinator with a grin: “He should be watching (football) tape on Friday night.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818748,"Alcaraz wins at Rio Open, eyes race with Djokovic for No.1","RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Top-seeded Carlos Alcaraz advanced to the second round of the Rio Open on Wednesday, with his mind already set for a year-long contest with Novak Djokovic for the No. 1 ranking. 

            The 19-year-old defending champion closed out the last two games of a match suspended the previous day because of rain to complete a 6-4, 6-4 win over Mateus Alves. 

            Alcaraz will next play Fabio Fognini, who beat Tomas Barrios Vera 6-2, 6-3 at the clay court tournament. 











            The Spanish teenager was sidelined for four months with a leg muscle injury and returned to the tour last week at the Argentina Open, where he dropped only one set en route to his first title since his Grand Slam breakthrough at the U.S. Open last year.

            Alcaraz, who in 2021 became the first teenage year-end No. 1 in ATP history, is currently second in the rankings. He said he doesn’t feel pressure to topple Djokovic from the top but he has set that as a key goal for 2023.

            “Truth is a beautiful year awaits, with beautiful tournaments. It is true there will be a little pressure to defend important titles. I will have to play at a good level but, as I always say, I play every match thinking I have to enjoy it, much beyond the results,” Alcaraz told a news conference. “I have to try to win more Grand Slam titles, reclaim the No. 1 position. That's what I am hoping for this year.”

            The hottest up-and-coming player on tour has titles to defend in Rio, Miami, Barcelona, Madrid and in the last major of the season in New York. 

            Alcaraz struggled at times against Alves, a Brazilian ranked No. 556 . He needed almost two hours of play to win, saying he'd only seen videos of his 22-year-old rival before their match.

            “It is not easy to stop after an entire match and have to start it again the next day,” Alcaraz said. “I feel I am doing well after four months injured. I had a very good week in Argentina and I am coming here with a lot of confidence.” 

            Also on Wednesday, second-seeded Cameron Norrie advanced with a 7-5, 7-5 win over Thiago Monteiro in 2 1/2 hours. He will face Hugo Dellien in the next round. The Bolivian beat Alex Molcan 1-6, 6-2, 6-2. 

            Norrie had the advantage of playing his entire round of 16 match on Wednesday while others were stopped by rain. 

            Last year's runner-up Diego Schwartzman was knocked out by Serbian player Dusan Lajovic 6-1, 6-4. Lajovic will next face compatriot Laslo Djere in the round of 16.

            Fourth-seeded Francisco Cerundolo beat Roberto Carballes Baena 4-6, 6-3, 6-3 and will meet Bernabe Zapata Miralles in the next round.

            Home crowd favorite Thomaz Bellucci had the last match of professional career against Sebastian Baez, who won 6-3, 6-2. The 35-year-old Bellucci's best ranking position was No. 21 in 2010.

            Baez next rival will be Juan Pablo Varillas.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818749,Brazil floods leave cutoff survivors scrambling for supplies,"SAO SEBASTIAO, Brazil (AP) — Hundreds of residents of a rain-battered region in Brazil’s Sao Paulo state were scrambling to find water and daily supplies Wednesday after floods and mudslides cut off their communities and left at least 48 people dead.

            Government and private aid groups were trying to provide necessities, but the logistics of reaching the isolated towns was creating difficulties. Authorities said they have reopened some damaged roadways into the region, but that recovery will take time.

            Rescue operations continue and firefighters, police and volunteers still hope to find people alive in the rubble of houses slammed by the landslides. Some 1,730 people have been displaced and 1,810 left homeless, according to the Sao Paulo state government. 











            The homeless are being sheltered in schools, kindergartens and churches in Sao Sebastiao. Around 7.5 tons of aid items including food, water and hygiene kits have already been distributed to the victims, according to the state government of Sao Paulo.

            But not all aid has reached its intended destination, with criminals taking advantage of the chaos and looting trucks carrying donations, Sao Paulo state’s Gov. Tarcísio de Freitas told the G1 news outlet.

            Brazil’s Environment Minister Marina Silva visited Barra do Sahy on Wednesday. Resident Reuri Nascimento, 33, told Silva he removed 22 bodies using his quadbike. He complained that victims of the floods and landslides had been abandoned and said supplies were not reaching them.

            “Why aren’t the police here to help us? There’s food trafficking, we don’t know where the food is going,” he said.

            Silva said President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s government was working to improve the situation. “We’re going to have to work to adapt the city, focusing on the poorest who are those who live near the hillside,” Silva said.

            Dozens are still missing, among which are Antônio Muniz’s 22-year-old daughter and son-in-law. Recently married, Muniz’s daughter was living in a rented house in Barra do Sahy, a district of the hardest-hit mountainous coastal municipality of Sao Sebastiao.

            Muniz was digging through the mud on Wednesday where his daughter’s house, hit by a mudslide, used to be. 

            “We’re asking God for help, to at least find her body,” he said.

            The municipality of Sao Sebastiao said 26 bodies have been identified, of which seven are children.

            Famous for beach resorts and flanked by mountains, the affected area is a frequent Carnival destination for rich city-dwellers who prefer to stay away from the massive street parties in their hometowns.

            With supplies running low, tensions have emerged between wealthy tourists and poorer permanent residents.

            Cida Fonseca, a 47-year-old woman who sells salty pastries on the beach in Barra do Sahy, said that when her daughter went to the shop to buy eggs, she found only water. 

            “They are buying everything. Instead of taking, they should leave,” she said. 

            Fonseca has lost friends and neighbors, while her house was flooded but not destroyed. For drinking water, she is relying on a small institution that is organizing donations and serving as a base for homeless people.

            Lula visited the region on Monday and called for people living in the hillside areas to be relocated to safer regions. But some residents who left their homes later discovered that they had been vandalized, Gov. de Freitas said. As a result, some have returned to their houses, located in at risk areas, and are refusing to leave, he added.

            On Wednesday a local court granted Sao Paulo state and the municipality of Sao Sebastiao permission to force residents from at-risk areas who refuse to move as a last resort, the Sao Paulo state government said.

            An Associated Press reporter was told that opportunists from outside have poured into the area with boats, charging stranded tourists up to 300 reais (nearly $60) to make the short trip between Barra do Sahy and neighboring Juquehy.

            But fisherman Edmilson Germano has been making the same trip for free. He made 30 trips on Tuesday, taking people away from Barra da Sahy to Juquehy and returning with food.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818750,PGA Tour money makes it tough on LIV players' Ryder hopes,"Players who joined Saudi-funded LIV Golf can still play in all the majors — and qualify for the Ryder Cup — now that the PGA Championship and British Open have announced only minor tweaks to existing criteria.

            But the main avenue to golf's biggest events still start with the PGA Tour, and that might become increasingly difficult for most LIV Golf players.

            As for the Ryder Cup, LIV players such as Dustin Johnson, Brooks Koepka and Patrick Reed likely would need to win at least one major to have any chance of earning one of the six automatic spots on the U.S. team for the Sept. 28-30 matches in Italy.











            The qualifying system is 1 point earned for every $1,000 won in PGA Tour events this year, with 1.5 points at the majors and double points for winning a major.

            “Any PGA of America member who is a U.S.-born player will be eligible to earn points,” Kerry Haigh, the PGA of America's chief championships officer, said in an interview. ""If the only events they get in are the majors, they would need to win one or more, or finish high in a couple of others.

            “Knowing where that sixth place is will be difficult to predict,"" he said. “This year has significantly different prize money.”

            Haigh was alluding to 10 PGA Tour events that have a $20 million purse — at least double what they were two years ago — plus The Players Championship at $25 million. LIV players are not eligible for any of those events because the tour has suspended them.

            The four majors have not announced their prize funds yet.

            Johnson currently is No. 14 in the Ryder Cup standings. He is three spots behind Keith Mitchell, who was No. 25 until he finished fifth at Riviera last week and earned $820,000 (820 points).

            That's one example of the movement available in the $20 million tournaments.

            The PGA Championship on Wednesday became the last major organization to weigh in, adding one category for three players from the new International Federation Ranking list for tours in Japan, Asia, South Africa and Australia.

            The top three will be determined on April 24. The current leaders include Sihwan Kim, who plays for LIV Golf, and Shaun Norris, who played an entire LIV Golf season last year but is not part of the 48-man roster this year.

            The majority of the PGA Championship field comes from the PGA Tour, either through winning or the money list. Officials also rely on special invitations, a vague term that presumably relies on the world ranking. The reputation of the PGA Championship has been to have the strongest field of the four majors.

            “The PGA of America also reserves the right to invite additional players ... in pursuit of our annual goal to deliver the strongest field in golf,” it said in a statement.

            But even if it leans on the world ranking, that might not work in LIV's favor.

            The league has filed an application with the Official World Golf Ranking board and still has not received notice when it might get approved. Even then, ranking points would be significantly less than those for the PGA Tour because of the 48-man LIV fields and only six players currently in the top 50.

            Of the 20 players from LIV Golf currently in the top 100, eight of them are at No. 75 and lower, and likely to keep dropping.

            Haigh said the PGA of America would consider LIV Golf as it would other circuits.

            “We look at other tours, money lists and rankings as we have done in the past and will do in the future,” he said. “It doesn't stop us from seeing other good players.”

            Asked if the PGA of America would consider LIV players, Haigh replied, “Absolutely.”

            Seth Waugh, the CEO of the PGA of America, said decisions are based on the best interest of the association and running the best championship possible.

            “Sadly the current division in the professional game is not good for the sport or the future of the game,” Waugh said. “We hope there might be some resolution soon. In the meantime, as always, our focus will be on our mission to grow the game and improve the lives of our members.""

            The Royal & Ancient and the U.S. Golf Association have said they would honor all players eligible for the British Open and U.S. Open. The Masters said in December it would keep its same criteria regardless of where someone played.

            Among the tweaks by the R&A was to eliminate anyone who played in the previous year's Presidents Cup or Ryder Cup. That might rule out Mito Pereira and Sebastian Munoz, both of whom joined LIV this year, though it also could eliminate Cam Davis and Taylor Pendrith. They still would access through PGA Tour means.

            The British Open added a category for an amateur who rates the highest in three premier amateur events in Europe. As for the Open Qualifying Series that take place at various tournaments, the leading three players who earn spots no longer have to finish in the top 10 at that event to be eligible.

            The R&A did make one distinction from the USGA.

            The U.S. Open exemption for the top 30 players who reach the Tour Championship requires they be eligible under PGA Tour regulations. That rules out Talor Gooch, who finished 29th in the FedEx Cup standings. The R&A had no such clause, meaning Gooch will be exempt for Royal Liverpool.

            AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsPlayers who joined Saudi-funded LIV Golf can still play in all the majors — and qualify for the Ryder Cup — now that the PGA Championship and British Open have announced only minor tweaks to existing criteria.But the main avenue to golf's biggest events still start with the PGA Tour, and that might become increasingly difficult for most LIV Golf players.As for the Ryder Cup, LIV players such as Dustin Johnson, Brooks Koepka and Patrick Reed likely would need to win at least one major to have any chance of earning one of the six automatic spots on the U.S. team for the Sept. 28-30 matches in Italy.The qualifying system is 1 point earned for every $1,000 won in PGA Tour events this year, with 1.5 points at the majors and double points for winning a major.“Any PGA of America member who is a U.S.-born player will be eligible to earn points,” Kerry Haigh, the PGA of America's chief championships officer, said in an interview. ""If the only events they get in are the majors, they would need to win one or more, or finish high in a couple of others.“Knowing where that sixth place is will be difficult to predict,"" he said. “This year has significantly different prize money.”Haigh was alluding to 10 PGA Tour events that have a $20 million purse — at least double what they were two years ago — plus The Players Championship at $25 million. LIV players are not eligible for any of those events because the tour has suspended them.The four majors have not announced their prize funds yet.Johnson currently is No. 14 in the Ryder Cup standings. He is three spots behind Keith Mitchell, who was No. 25 until he finished fifth at Riviera last week and earned $820,000 (820 points).That's one example of the movement available in the $20 million tournaments.The PGA Championship on Wednesday became the last major organization to weigh in, adding one category for three players from the new International Federation Ranking list for tours in Japan, Asia, South Africa and Australia.The top three will be determined on April 24. The current leaders include Sihwan Kim, who plays for LIV Golf, and Shaun Norris, who played an entire LIV Golf season last year but is not part of the 48-man roster this year.The majority of the PGA Championship field comes from the PGA Tour, either through winning or the money list. Officials also rely on special invitations, a vague term that presumably relies on the world ranking. The reputation of the PGA Championship has been to have the strongest field of the four majors.“The PGA of America also reserves the right to invite additional players ... in pursuit of our annual goal to deliver the strongest field in golf,” it said in a statement.But even if it leans on the world ranking, that might not work in LIV's favor.The league has filed an application with the Official World Golf Ranking board and still has not received notice when it might get approved. Even then, ranking points would be significantly less than those for the PGA Tour because of the 48-man LIV fields and only six players currently in the top 50.Of the 20 players from LIV Golf currently in the top 100, eight of them are at No. 75 and lower, and likely to keep dropping.Haigh said the PGA of America would consider LIV Golf as it would other circuits.“We look at other tours, money lists and rankings as we have done in the past and will do in the future,” he said. “It doesn't stop us from seeing other good players.”Asked if the PGA of America would consider LIV players, Haigh replied, “Absolutely.”Seth Waugh, the CEO of the PGA of America, said decisions are based on the best interest of the association and running the best championship possible.“Sadly the current division in the professional game is not good for the sport or the future of the game,” Waugh said. “We hope there might be some resolution soon. In the meantime, as always, our focus will be on our mission to grow the game and improve the lives of our members.""The Royal & Ancient and the U.S. Golf Association have said they would honor all players eligible for the British Open and U.S. Open. The Masters said in December it would keep its same criteria regardless of where someone played.Among the tweaks by the R&A was to eliminate anyone who played in the previous year's Presidents Cup or Ryder Cup. That might rule out Mito Pereira and Sebastian Munoz, both of whom joined LIV this year, though it also could eliminate Cam Davis and Taylor Pendrith. They still would access through PGA Tour means.The British Open added a category for an amateur who rates the highest in three premier amateur events in Europe.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818751,South Carolina House OKs permitless carry of handguns,"COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — The Republican-controlled South Carolina House voted overwhelmingly Wednesday to allow lawful firearm owners to carry handguns openly or concealed without a state permit.

            The 90-30 vote brings the conservative state one step closer to joining 25 others with some form of so-called “constitutional carry” laws. The fate of the state's latest effort to loosen gun restrictions once more falls to the Senate, where lawmakers rejected a similar proposal two years ago.

            “This will open up options for families to protect themselves without a permit,” said Republican Rep. Bobby Cox, the bill's leading sponsor. “South Carolinians can still get the training they need. But they don’t need a permission slip to exercise that right.”











            Republicans passed the bill over the strong objections of many Democrats who said the move would decrease public safety in communities already ravaged by gun deaths. Opponents included one lawmaker whose sister was one of the nine Black churchgoers killed by an avowed white supremacist in a 2015 mass shooting at the South's oldest African Methodist Episcopal church.

            Rep. JA Moore accused Republicans of publicly supporting a measure privately acknowledged by some as a “bad bill.""

            “My sister was murdered by a legal gun that a white supremacist terrorist should not have had,"" Moore said. “So shame on y’all for playing politics with people’s lives.”

            The measure would restrict people from bringing guns into detention centers, courthouses, polling places, government offices, school athletic events, schools, religious sanctuaries and doctor's offices, among other locations.

            On-duty law enforcement, Armed Forces, National Guard, state militia and members of the judiciary are exempt from those restrictions. After some discussion, lawmakers added public defenders and county clerks of court to the list but explicitly barred them from carrying concealed weapons into correctional facilities.

            The measure would effectively lower the age at which South Carolinians can carry a concealed gun. State law allows anyone 18 or older to purchase a gun. But concealed weapons permits have only been available to people over 21 years old.

            The process for obtaining a concealed weapons permit in South Carolina currently requires about eight hours of training. Another failed amendment sought to add language encouraging citizens to complete a “firearm education course.”

            Several amendments made strange bedfellows of Democrats and the ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus. One successful change added language explicitly stating that the open carry of a weapon “does not give a law enforcement officer reasonable suspicion or probable cause to search, detain, or arrest the person.” Some Black lawmakers expressed concerns that police officers would treat African American gunowners differently than others.

            One particular section similarly drew opposition from the two typically opposing groups.

            In addition to allowing permitless carry, the bill would bar people convicted of most felonies from firearm possession and align state penalties with federal law. Violations would draw prison terms up to five years for a first offense, five to 20 years for a second offense and ten to 30 years for a subsequent offense. There are also exemptions for those convicted of business crimes such as antitrust violations or unfair trade practices. It also would exempt anyone convicted of a misdemeanor punishable by five years imprisonment or less.

            Republican Rep. Thomas Beach said the section amounted to a “gun grab” consistent with President Joe Biden’s “anti-2nd Amendment agenda.” Democrats also criticized their counterparts for creating a new criminal law restricting firearm ownership within this supposed expansion of gun rights.

            Democratic Rep. Seth Rose charged Republicans with squeezing two measures into one bill in a “bait-and-switch” that bypassed the necessary committee process, where law enforcement officials have previously expressed opposition to similar permitless carry proposals.

             “When you show up to a crime scene and everyone’s carrying guns on their hip, guess what, that’s dangerous,” Rose said. ""Law enforcement doesn’t know who the good guys are and the bad guys are. And a lot of times we don’t want good guys acting like law enforcement and making a bad situation worse.”

            Cox supported the effort he said both protects law abiding gun owners and targets violent criminals. Cox said lawmakers worked extensively on the bill with the National Rifle Association, South Carolina Law Enforcement Division and local sheriffs.

            Republican Rep. Weston Newton suggested the additional “felon-in-possession statute” was necessary to secure support from law enforcement groups who wanted more tools to crack down on repeat offenders charged with misdemeanor gun possession.

            “This language needs to stay in this bill or law enforcement is against this bill,"" Netwon said. ""This was part of the arrangement when it went in.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818752,Jan. 6 rioter who threatened Rep. Ocasio-Cortez gets 3 years,"A Texas man who threatened U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Twitter after he stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 was sentenced on Wednesday to more than three years in prison. 

            Garret Miller was wearing a shirt that read “I Was There, Washington D.C., January 6, 2021” with a picture on President Donald Trump on it when law enforcement officers showed up at his Dallas-area home to arrest him two weeks after the riot. Miller has already spent more than two years behind bars since his arrest, and with credit for good behavior, he's expected to serve another eight months, according to his lawyer, F. Clinton Broden. 

            Miller, a 36-year-old from Richardson, was among the many rioters who thoroughly documented their actions that day in a flurry of social media posts. After Miller posted a selfie showing himself inside the Capitol, a friend wrote, “bro you got in?! Nice!” Miller replied, “just wanted to incriminate myself a little lol,” according to court papers. 











            On Jan. 6, he helped lead the charge as rioters removed barriers and swarmed the east front of the Capitol, prosecutors said. He was twice briefly detained by police but released and told to leave as overwhelmed officers struggled to beat back the mob, prosecutors said. 

            Instead of leaving, Miller went inside the Capitol, where authorities say he was aggressive toward police and ignored their commands as they tried to force him to exit. He grabbed at one officer's baton and put his hand on another as he resisted being pushed out of the Rotunda, according to prosecutors. 

            The night of Jan. 6, Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat who represents parts of New York City, tweeted the word “Impeach.” Miller responded to her on Twitter with: “Assassinate AOC."" The next day, he bragged to a friend in a message that the rioters “terrified congress,"" prosecutors say. 

            Shortly after the 2020 election, he also sent a threatening message to the Instagram account of Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, writing “we are coming for you,"" according to prosecutors. U.S. Capitol Police referred the threat to the FBI, who at that point were already investigating Miller for his Jan. 6 actions, prosecutors say. He was not charged with threatening Schumer. 

            Days after the riot, Miller was sharing photos of the officer he believed fatally shot Ashli Babbitt at the Capitol, prosecutors say. In a Facebook message on Jan. 10, Miller said he and others were going to get a hold of the officer and “hug his neck with a nice rope,"" according to court papers. 

            Miller's attorney had asked the judge to impose time served, while prosecutors had sought four years in prison. 

            Miller's attorney said in court documents that despite his client's tweet about Ocasio-Cortez and messages about the officer, “there is no indication that he made any effort whatsoever to actually harm anybody.” 

            “It should be always be remembered that, although Garret is fully responsible for his individual actions that day, his actions and the actions of many others were a product of rhetoric from a cult leader that has yet to be brought to justice,” Broden said in an email Wednesday. ""Garret Miller was not the name on the flag carried by those who invaded our Capitol on this dark day in our nation’s history. “

            In a letter to the judge, Miller called his social media posts “disgusting and a complete embarrassment” and apologized to Ocasio-Cortez, Schumer, the officer who shot Babbitt and the other officers Miller interacted with on Jan. 6. 

            “I feel a deep remorse for not being helpful to police that day and aiding in destruction and pain. It was unnecessary, barbaric, and disrespectful. I was proud, arrogant, and acted in anger. I needed to be humbled” he wrote. 

            Miller pleaded guilty in December to charges including interfering with law enforcement during a civil disorder, assaulting, resisting or impeding officers and threatening Ocasio-Cortez. 

            Miller was charged separately this month in Texas federal court with one count of possession of an unregistered firearm, according to court documents. When he was arrested on the Jan. 6 charges, authorities found an AR-style rifle at his home that had been configured to fire like a machine gun. 

            He's among nearly 1,000 people have been charged with federal crimes related to the Jan. 6 riot and more than 500 who have pleaded guilty. About 400 rioters have been sentenced, with over half getting terms of imprisonment ranging from seven days to 10 years.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818755,Government proposes regulator to oversee English soccer,"LONDON (AP) — A government plan would allow English soccer to be overseen by an independent regulator to ensure the financial sustainability of clubs throughout the leagues and stop teams from joining breakaway competitions like the European Super League.

            In what is described as a “radical transformation of the rules governing how football is run in England,” the British government is acting on a recommendation from a fan-led review carried out in the wake of the collapse of two lower-league clubs — Bury and Macclesfield — because of financial mismanagement.

            It also comes in response to the failed attempts of 12 of Europe’s elite clubs — including six from England’s Premier League — to set up a European Super League in 2021. The English clubs quickly shelved the idea after a backlash from fans and the government.











            The government on Thursday will publish its “white paper on football governance” which will propose the creation of a regulator for the elite men’s game to implement a new licensing system from the Premier League down to the fifth tier. It would require clubs to “demonstrate sound financial business models and good corporate governance as part of an application process before being allowed to compete.”

            It would give fans a greater say in the running of clubs, such as changing names or colors of the jersey, and require clubs to seek approval from the regulator for any sale or relocation of a stadium.

            It would have the power to prevent English clubs from joining new competitions that do not meet predetermined criteria, in consultation with the Football Association and fans.

            “That criteria could include measures to stop clubs participating in closed-shop breakaway competitions which harm the domestic game,” the government said.

            The regulator would also run an owners’ and directors’ test with a focus on the fitness and propriety of new owners and enhanced due diligence. It was not immediately clear whether there would be any human-rights element to the test, which Amnesty International has called on the Premier League to introduce in the wake of the Saudi-led takeover of Newcastle and has repeated amid a Qatari bid for Manchester United.

            The government is confident the regulator’s powers would be balanced in such a way that it will not diminish the competitiveness and strength of the Premier League, which is financially superior to every other league in Europe.

            According to the government, the regulator would have “targeted powers of last resort” to intervene “as and when necessary.”

            The Premier League said its clubs ""will now carefully consider the government’s plan for England to become the first major nation to make football a government-regulated industry.”

            The Premier League stressed it was “vital that regulation does not damage the game fans love to watch in the deepest professional pyramid in the world, or its ability to attract investment and grow interest in our game.”

            It warned of “unintended consequences that could affect the Premier League’s position as the most-watched football league in the world, reduce its competitiveness or put the unrivaled levels of funding we provide at risk.”

            The government said it will now embark on further consultation with the key stakeholders.

            “These bold new plans will put fans back at the heart of football, protect the rich heritage and traditions of our much-loved clubs and safeguard the beautiful game for future generations,” British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said.

The English clubs quickly shelved the idea after a backlash from fans and the government.The government on Thursday will publish its “white paper on football governance” which will propose the creation of a regulator for the elite men’s game to implement a new licensing system from the Premier League down to the fifth tier. It would require clubs to “demonstrate sound financial business models and good corporate governance as part of an application process before being allowed to compete.”It would give fans a greater say in the running of clubs, such as changing names or colors of the jersey, and require clubs to seek approval from the regulator for any sale or relocation of a stadium.It would have the power to prevent English clubs from joining new competitions that do not meet predetermined criteria, in consultation with the Football Association and fans.“That criteria could include measures to stop clubs participating in closed-shop breakaway competitions which harm the domestic game,” the government said.The regulator would also run an owners’ and directors’ test with a focus on the fitness and propriety of new owners and enhanced due diligence. It was not immediately clear whether there would be any human-rights element to the test, which Amnesty International has called on the Premier League to introduce in the wake of the Saudi-led takeover of Newcastle and has repeated amid a Qatari bid for Manchester United.The government is confident the regulator’s powers would be balanced in such a way that it will not diminish the competitiveness and strength of the Premier League, which is financially superior to every other league in Europe.According to the government, the regulator would have “targeted powers of last resort” to intervene “as and when necessary.”The Premier League said its clubs ""will now carefully consider the government’s plan for England to become the first major nation to make football a government-regulated industry.”The Premier League stressed it was “vital that regulation does not damage the game fans love to watch in the deepest professional pyramid in the world, or its ability to attract investment and grow interest in our game.”It warned of “unintended consequences that could affect the Premier League’s position as the most-watched football league in the world, reduce its competitiveness or put the unrivaled levels of funding we provide at risk.”The government said it will now embark on further consultation with the key stakeholders.“These bold new plans will put fans back at the heart of football, protect the rich heritage and traditions of our much-loved clubs and safeguard the beautiful game for future generations,” British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/2/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818756,Student confessed to hoax bomb threat on Texas flight,"EL PASO, Texas (AP) — A high school student confessed to sending a hoax bomb threat via AirDrop that resulted in an American Airlines flight being diverted from the tarmac at a Texas airport last week, authorities said.

            The Texas Department of Public Safety said that while the flight was taxiing on Friday at El Paso International Airport, passengers got a message on their Apple devices via AirDrop saying: “I have a bomb would like to share a photo."" In the statement released Monday, the agency said that because of that message, the aircraft taxied back to a gate.

            The Department of Public Safety said that an investigation resulted in the identification of the juvenile, who confessed to sending the AirDrop. The agency said evidence supporting the confession was found on the suspect's cellphone.

            The Department of Public Safety said the El Paso County attorney agreed to prosecute the juvenile for false alarm or report, and the juvenile was released to the custody of the El Paso County Juvenile Probation Department.

            Central Catholic High School in Pittsburgh said in a statement that the juvenile is a student there who was returning from a school-sponsored mission trip near the Texas-Mexico boarder. The school said that the student sent the message “in jest.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818761,Leafs pin hopes on O'Reilly to help end playoff frustrations,"BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) — Come April, the Toronto Maple Leafs will once again have to confront the long-nagging questions of how they’ll attempt to avoid turning a dominating regular season into yet another early playoff exit. 

            A promising glimpse of an answer, perhaps, began to emerge over a four-day stretch in which the Maple Leafs won two of three with a new-look lineup featuring centers Ryan O’Reilly and Noel Acciari, who were acquired in a trade with St. Louis. 

            With O’Reilly centering Toronto’s second line, and Acciari centering the fourth line, their presence provided coach Sheldon Keefe an extra level of flexibility and an additional dynamic dimension to a talent-laden roster that already includes four 20-goal-scorers.











            Toronto’s newfound potential was on display in a 6-3 romp over the Sabres on Tuesday, when the O’Reilly line combined for four goals and 13 points, and staked the Leafs to a 3-0 lead 7:14 into the game before Buffalo registered its first shot on net.

            “Obviously, it was that line that broke out tonight. The next night it might be the Matthews’ line,” Keefe said, referring to the top line centered by Auston Matthews. “But as I said to the guys, that’s what it is supposed to look like in terms of a team game. ... That’s as dominant as we’ve been all season long, so it’s tremendous to see.”

            The challenge for Keefe becomes building on that performance and continuing to develop roster-wide chemistry to finally begin fulfilling the long-awaited expectations of mounting a playoff run that doesn’t end in the first round. 

            The Maple Leafs have not won a playoff series since 2004, when they needed seven games to eliminate Ottawa before losing to Philadelphia in a six-game second-round matchup. They’ve since lost seven consecutive first-round series mostly in dramatic collapses, including six ending in a decisive Game 5 or 7.

            The frustrating track record is one general manager Kyle Dubas alluded to after completing the trade on Friday in giving up four draft picks, including a first-rounder this year, two minor leaguers and a prospect in a deal that included Minnesota picking up 25% of O’Reilly’s salary.

            “We’ve been in the top five of the standings, and we’re there again this year,” Dubas said of a team that’s finished no worse than third in its division in each of the previous six years. “So there’s a lot of points along the way, and people will laugh at that, scoff at that, and that’s fine. We’re trying to win. And that’s the message.”

            At 35-15-8, the Leafs’ 78 points match their best through 58 games of a season, and they are second in the Atlantic Division. With division-leading Boston enjoying a 13-point lead over the Maple Leafs entering Wednesday, Toronto appears locked into facing Tampa Bay in a rematch of last year’s opening round, which the Lightning clinched in Game 7 by rallying from a 3-2 series deficit.

            The trade for O’Reilly was the latest in a string of high-profile mid-to-late season additions the Leafs have made which have failed to pan out come playoff time. Last year, it was adding defenseman Mark Giordano. Two years ago, Toronto acquired center Nick Foligno. In 2020, Dubas landed defenseman Jake Muzzin. 

            And those don’t include the offseason free-agent splashes the Leafs made in signing Patrick Marleau in 2017 or current captain John Tavares a year later.

            O’Reilly, in the final year of his contract, represents the short-term key to the trade. He’s a respected two-way center, who was the NHL’s top defensive forward in 2019, the same year O’Reilly earned playoff MVP honors for the Stanley Cup champion Blues.

            From Ontario, and with his mother having once worked the concession stands at Maple Leaf Gardens, the 32-year-old O’Reilly is fully aware of the pressures of playing in Toronto and what it would mean to bring home a title.

            “We have a ton of good pieces here and it’s a great team,” O’Reilly said, while declining to look too far ahead.

            “I’ve got to take it day by day and work and push myself to be better, and try to help elevate this team to take another step,” he added. “I’ve got so much excitement being here. ... I’m just going to feed off that and try to make an impact any way I can.”

            In welcoming O’Reilly, Tavares agreed to make the switch from center to left wing on a line rounded out by Mitchell Marner. 

            “When Kyle and management make a move like that, obviously it sends a strong message,” Tavares said. “The belief in the team, and what we want to accomplish, and just where we’ve gotten to to this point, so we’re really excited about it.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818762,Georgia lawmakers pare back bill to increase truck weights,"ATLANTA (AP) — Georgia lawmakers are watering down a bill to allow heavier trucks on state highways after widespread opposition to the original measure by state and local officials.

            Rep. Steven Meeks, a Screven Republican, described the changes as “just really paring this back to agriculture and forestry.”

            The House Transportation Committee voted 12-7 on Wednesday to allow heavier weight limits for trucks carrying logging, farming and mining commodities. The bill was also amended to allow some trucks to insert a third axle, which could allow for heavier dump trucks, for example, because weight limits are usually calculated based on the number of axles.











            Trucks carrying those goods could now be as heavy as 90,000 pounds (40,800 kilograms), up from 84,000 pounds (38,102 kilograms) now. Other trucks would remain limited to 80,000 pounds, the same as the federal limit on interstate highways.

            
                The amended House Bill 189 was sent back to the full House for more debate.

            
                The committee had voted Feb. 9 to raise the limit on state roads to 90,000 pounds for all trucks. But the full House sent the bill back to committee to be revised, a sign that it lacked support. It's not clear if the changes will placate opponents.

            Logging, farming and trucking groups have long been seeking the increase, saying they could save money by hauling the same amount of freight over fewer trips.

            But the state Department of Transportation and city and county officials have opposed the move, saying heavier trucks would do more damage to highways and bridges. Local officials fear heavier trucks will cut through on local roads even where they are barred. 

            State Transportation Commissioner Russell McMurry warned lawmakers that it could cost billions more to rebuild damaged state highways and to replace state bridges that wouldn’t meet the new weight standard, suggesting Georgia might have to increase fuel taxes.

            Opponents say that heavier trucks would also be less safe because the heavier a vehicle is, the longer distance it takes to stop.

            Gov. Brian Kemp has been allowing heavy trucks that get special permits to haul up to 95,000 pounds (43,091 kilograms), under a supply chain emergency order that he has repeatedly renewed. The current order lasts through March 11.

            Meeks said that 6,500 forestry trucks obtained permits last year to carry up to 95,000 pounds, compared to the millions of truck trips each year in the state.

            “We have significantly pared back the number of vehicles that would be allowed to run under the weight limit,"" Meeks said.

            The bill still contains higher fines for trucks that exceed weight limits and requires both the truck and trailer to be certified for the heavier weight, Meeks said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818764,Indiana lawmakers back defunding Kinsey sex institute,"INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Indiana Republican lawmakers voted Wednesday to prohibit Indiana University from using any state money to support its sexual research institution after a far-right legislator unleashed disputed allegations of child exploitation by its founder and famed mid-20th century researcher Alfred Kinsey.

            The Indiana House voted 53-34 to block state funding toward the Kinsey Institute that has long faced criticism from conservatives for its ongoing research and the legacy of Kinsey’s work that they blame for contributing to liberalized sexual morals, including more acceptance of homosexuality and pornography.

            Alfred Kinsey, who died in 1956, produced groundbreaking sex-behavior studies in 1948 and 1953 and was portrayed by Liam Neeson in the 2004 film “Kinsey.”











            Republican Rep. Lorissa Sweet claimed that some of Kinsey’s research was child exploitation as she argued for an amendment to the state budget bill against funding for the institute.

            “By limiting the funding to Kinsey Institute through Indiana University’s tax dollars, we can be assured that we are not funding ongoing research committed by crimes.” Sweet said.

            Democratic Rep. Matt Pierce, whose Bloomington district includes the university campus, responded that Sweet’s claims were “based on old unproven allegations of conspiracies that did not exist,” calling them “warmed-over internet memes that keep coming back.”

            Pierce said the university maintained a department that ensured all research involving humans met federal laws and that the Kinsey Institute aimed to better understand human sexuality, including how to treat and prevent sexual predators and pedophiles.

            An Indiana University spokesman and the institute’s director didn’t immediately comment on the vote.

            Seven Republican House members joined all Democrats present in voting against Sweet’s proposal, which specifically prohibits the use of state money for expenses including the institute’s on-campus facilities, research work, utilities, office supplies and maintenance of research photographs or films.

            Pierce said the institute’s funding was being exploited as a “culture war” issue and that it would simply create bookkeeping problems for the university to use sources such as outside grant funding or student tuition to support it.

            The fate of the Kinsey funding prohibition might not be decided until a final version of the state budget is voted upon by lawmakers in late April.INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Indiana Republican lawmakers voted Wednesday to prohibit Indiana University from using any state money to support its sexual research institution after a far-right legislator unleashed disputed allegations of child exploitation by its founder and famed mid-20th century researcher Alfred Kinsey.The Indiana House voted 53-34 to block state funding toward the Kinsey Institute that has long faced criticism from conservatives for its ongoing research and the legacy of Kinsey’s work that they blame for contributing to liberalized sexual morals, including more acceptance of homosexuality and pornography.Alfred Kinsey, who died in 1956, produced groundbreaking sex-behavior studies in 1948 and 1953 and was portrayed by Liam Neeson in the 2004 film “Kinsey.”Republican Rep.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818766,"Coach K stays busy with 'Basketball and Beyond', speeches","Mike Krzyzewski isn’t coaching for the first time in 48 years, but that doesn’t mean he has retired.

            Despite being away from the sidelines, the Hall of Fame coach has been busy with speeches and his “Basketball and Beyond with Coach K” show on SiriusXM satellite radio.

            “It’s been good. I don’t miss coaching. I coached for almost five decades,” Krzyzewski said. “I knew I did not want to coach anymore, but I didn’t want to retire. I do a lot of speaking. I’m on the road at least once, sometimes twice a week, to different locations, and I’ve learned a lot doing that.”











            Krzyzewski — who won 1,202 games, five national titles and made 13 Final Fours during his career at Army and Duke — watched his first game post-retirement at Cameron Indoor Stadium on Feb. 14, when Notre Dame faced Duke. Mike Brey, a former Krzyzewski assistant, announced it would be his final season as Notre Dame’s coach earlier this season.

            Even though Coach K isn’t at the games, he said he has watched every game this season and talks frequently with his successor, Jon Scheyer.

            “I’m here when he needs me. But I also want him to give him the space he needs to develop his own brand within our brand,” Krzyzewski said.

            The one area where Krzyzewski has been able to devote additional time is to his radio show, which airs weekly during basketball season. This is the 18th year that Krzyzewski has done the show.

            “I still prepared (for the show when he was coaching), but I’m preparing better,” he said. “I think we’re having our best year because I’m able to think deeper into what I want and, what would be interesting to ask. Not only to do it from a coach’s perspective, but also from a fan’s perspective.”

            Krzyzewski did the usual format of coach call-in shows early in his career at Duke but decided he didn’t want to do that after a couple seasons. It wasn’t until SiriusXM approached him in 2005 about doing an interview show that he decided to give it another try. Dave Sims has been Coach K's co-host since the show started.

            While coaching, Krzyzewski said doing the show was like a release for him and provided him with some additional material to help coach his players.

            “Sometimes in taking notes, if I went to practice after that, I would say, ‘Hey, I just had so and so on. This is how they defined courage, or this is an interesting thing about how they got over a loss.’ Or sometimes to even get the audio where they got to hear Kevin Durant express himself about different things,” Krzyzewski said.

            This season’s guests have featured plenty of basketball guests, including former Villanova coach Jay Wright, former Duke player and Orlando Magic rookie Paolo Banchero, and WNBA legend Sue Bird.

            When it comes to the beyond part, Krzyzewski has had a cross-section of guests that have featured Houston Astros manager Dusty Baker, NASCAR champion Joe Logano and best-selling author James Patterson.

            Krzyzewski said the most significant improvement in conducting interviews over the past couple of years has been doing them on Zoom because he felt there is more to get out of a subject by being able to do it face-to-face instead of over the phone.

            “Kind of a recurring theme is deep learning about people and how they do their jobs. People can continually learn about different ways of how people better themselves. And I like that, especially when I’m talking to the announcers, the people who have their shows or key members of shows,” he said.

            Krzyzewski also hasn’t been afraid to express his opinion on different subjects. On an episode of his show last year, he addressed a lack of action from legislators for not doing enough to protect people with the rise in mass shootings.

            The one thing that continues to please Krzyzewski is how open people are to sharing their experiences.

            “It’s really like you’re eavesdropping in on a conversation, and it is such a neat experience. They’ll bring up some of the past and things you forget. It’s really such a good thing,” he said. “I’ve always wanted to be really good, but now I put even more time into it.”

I don’t miss coaching. I coached for almost five decades,” Krzyzewski said. “I knew I did not want to coach anymore, but I didn’t want to retire. I do a lot of speaking. I’m on the road at least once, sometimes twice a week, to different locations, and I’ve learned a lot doing that.”Krzyzewski — who won 1,202 games, five national titles and made 13 Final Fours during his career at Army and Duke — watched his first game post-retirement at Cameron Indoor Stadium on Feb. 14, when Notre Dame faced Duke.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818767,GOP Oklahoma lawmakers join call for death penalty pause,"OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — Three Oklahoma Republican lawmakers joined a former corrections official on Wednesday to call for a moratorium on the death penalty amid growing concerns about the state's brisk pace of lethal injections.

            Rep. Kevin McDugle said he supports the death penalty but believes Oklahoma's next death row inmate scheduled to die, Richard Glossip, is actually innocent.

            “His case is what got me involved with this, and I could not stand to see an innocent man put to death in Oklahoma, and I happen to know that Oklahomans don't want to put an innocent man to death in Oklahoma either,"" said McDugle, a Republican from Broken Arrow. 











            Glossip, who has long maintained his innocence, is scheduled to be executed on May 18 in the murder-for-hire killing of his former boss, but Oklahoma's new Attorney General Gentner Drummond has ordered an independent review of his conviction.

            McDugle was joined at a press conference Wednesday by two other Republican lawmakers and says many more of his GOP colleagues support his effort. Among those requesting a moratorium was Adam Luck, an appointee of Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt to both the Board of Corrections that oversees the state prison system and the Pardon and Parole Board. Luck resigned last year after disagreements with Stitt over imposing the death penalty. Some clergy members also took part in the news conference.

            Oklahoma has executed more inmates per capita than any other state since the reinstatement of the death penalty in 1976. Since that time 10 death row inmates have walked free after being acquitted at a new trial or because prosecutors declined to refile charges that were dismissed by a court.

            Opposition to the death penalty, even among conservatives, is growing across the U.S., said Richard Dieter, director of the Washington, D.C.-based Death Penalty Information Center, a nonprofit that takes no position on capital punishment but has criticized the way states carry out executions.

            “Conservatives have a platform for life, and life is on the line here in these cases, so it’s not totally surprising,” Dieter said. 

            Public support and use of the death penalty in 2022 continued its more than two-decade decline in the U.S., but support remains high in Oklahoma. A state ballot question in 2016 on whether to enshrine the death penalty in the Oklahoma Constitution received more than 65% of the vote.

            Still, McDugle cited a recent Oklahoma poll that suggests that support wanes considerably when respondents are offered sentencing options like life in prison with or without parole.

            Oklahoma has carried out eight executions since resuming lethal injections in October 2021 following a six-year moratorium after problems with drug mix-ups and a botched lethal injection in 2014.

            Attorney General Drummond last month asked the Court of Criminal Appeals to slow the rapid pace of executions, which the court agreed to do.

            Drummond said in an interview with The Associated Press last month that while he recognizes the death penalty is a legal punishment in Oklahoma, he wonders if families of murder victims would suffer less if their loved one's killer was sentenced to life in prison without parole. 

            “I wonder if the family wouldn’t be able to just flip the switch and start healing knowing this guy is never coming out,” Drummond said. “I talked to every one of these families, and it’s like they’re on an emotional yo-yo.”OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — Three Oklahoma Republican lawmakers joined a former corrections official on Wednesday to call for a moratorium on the death penalty amid growing concerns about the state's brisk pace of lethal injections.Rep.

Cloud 11 will serve the growing Creator Economy as a hub for aspiring new-gen content creators to pursue creative-content careers/business through collaborations with Thai and international partners.         Cloud 11 embraces an “Empowering Creators” concept and will support content creators through 3 key pillars:        o Content Creation Ecosystem: Offering studio spaces, funds, talent, and state-of-the-art equipment, it provides the most comprehensive ecosystem for content creation.     o Virtual–Physical Bridge: It connects Thai creators with global markets via technologies such as Web3, Metaverse, and Blockchain, enabling immersive experiences from both virtual and physical realms.     o Inclusive Progress: It offers spaces for young people to embrace diversity founded on equality and social contribution for mutual growth.        Cloud 11, MQDC’s second theme project, has a project value of over 40 billion THB, with gross floor area of 254,000 square meters. It features a shopping mall and creative offices for the content industry, studios spaces, 2 lifestyle hotels, education, research centers, concert/e-sport halls, and Bangkok’s largest rooftop park.      BANGKOK, THAILAND -  Media OutReach - 23 February 2023 - Magnolia Quality Development Corporation Limited (MQDC), a leading property developer, unveiled  Cloud 11 as a 40 billion THB project to serve the growing Creator Economy with an ""Empowering Creators"" concept. Cloud 11 is positioned as Asia's largest hub for content creators and a center where the new generation can pursue careers and develop businesses in content creation. This project is one of the innovation clusters in South Sukhumvit.            Mr. Narong Chearavanont, Honorary Chairman of Cloud 11 Advisory Committee, said: ""Technologies and innovations are key driving forces for the global economy, accelerating significant growth across various sectors. Technologies have already disrupted entertainment and the creative content industry too, with AI (artificial intelligence) for content creation and more tech-enabled platforms to efficiently provide content to end consumers. Thailand, for its part, has many advantages when it comes to the content industry. Thailand's impressive culture provides valuable material for content creation. The country also has so many talents. But these resources are just scattered and not yet fully integrated with technologies and innovations.   ""Cloud 11 will connect the dots in the ecosystem and complete the content industry. It is going to be Asia's largest hub for content creators, where they will be empowered by the pool of talents, learning centers, funds, and opportunities. Cloud 11 will be the gateway for Thai creators to jointly present outstanding Thai culture as soft power in the world and effectively create a brand of love for our nation.""   Mr. Visit Malaisirirat, Chief Executive Officer of MQDC, said: ""We have always honored our 'For All Well-Being' philosophy with our property projects that enhance the lives of all on a sustainable basis. Every MQDC project delivers benefits to local communities, the public, and the country, as it is developed with innovations, advanced technologies, and concepts in line with national development policies. We have invested in the Cloud 11 project to create an innovation cluster for new-gen and creative innovation in South Sukhumvit.""   Mr. Onza Janyaprasert, Project Director of Cloud 11, said: ""The entertainment industry is now in a transitional period because of fast-evolving technologies. Content creators thus are going to have a bigger role to play and significantly drive the entertainment industry via the Creator Economy trend. That's why we have developed Cloud 11 as Asia's largest hub for content creators based on an 'Empowering Creators' concept. Cloud 11 will be the most comprehensive ecosystem for content creators thanks to our collaborations with both local and international partners. We have turned a new page in history because Cloud 11, as a content creator hub, will be a theme property project dedicated to the content industry.   ""Cloud 11 not only has physical facilities to comprehensively fulfill the needs of content creation and new-gen lifestyles, but it will also give inspiration, knowledge and growth opportunities to creators, content-based enterprises, and related businesses. We expect Cloud 11 to empower Thai creators and bring them to the global market. Also, we truly hope that our project will contribute to efforts to turn Thailand into a top global content provider.""   Cloud 11 is developed based on an  ""Empowering Creators"" concept. Designed to support content creators, this project aims to serve as a hub of aspiring new-generation content creators and support their dream to pursue careers/business in the content industry. Being much more than just a mixed-use property project, it presents a model of an Innovation Cluster. The concept is based upon the following 3 key pillars:     Content Creation Ecosystem: Boasting studio spaces, funds, talent, and modern equipment, this is the most comprehensive ecosystem for content creation. It promises to facilitate the creation of content in various forms, such as music, podcasts, movies, short videos, animation, games, as well as art and design. Cloud 11 will bring together players of all sizes, including Thai startups and SMEs, as well as global entertainment companies.     Virtual–Physical Bridge: Designed to bring Thai creators to the world, this bridge leverages technologies such as Web3 and the Metaverse. Audiences and fans in foreign countries will be able to enjoy immersive experiences from content created by Thais, with tech solutions blending the physical and virtual realms. Blockchain technology will be applied to protect copyrights and support fairer revenue-sharing across the chain of creative content at greater efficiency.     Inclusive Progress: Embracing diversity and equitability, Cloud 11 plans programs to empower the growth of emerging creators, non-mainstream artists, and small entrepreneurs. Cloud 11 will also create Bangkok's largest rooftop park for community benefits. People from creator circles and local communities can come and enjoy activities together in this green space. Cloud 11 intends to support local businesses so it will contribute to local economic development too.     Cloud 11 has 7 zones:     Creative Office & Studio Space: Grade-A office spaces, including studio spaces, will be available to content creators. This zone will be open round-the-clock, with flexible and quiet air-conditioning. Integrated into this zone are private lifts for artists. This office zone will meet LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) standards for sustainability and environmental care, the WELL Building Standard for building users' well-being, and the WiredScore/SmartScore standard for efficient integration of smart systems, superfast internet services, and networks for the content industry.     Hybrid Retail: This shopping mall embraces an entirely new concept, as it is designed to support the businesses of or shops for content creators. The Fulfillment Center helps with storing, packing, and delivering products. Physical shops can therefore be small and efficient. The Cloud Kitchen supports food creators who don't yet want to invest in opening their own restaurants and offering dine-in services. There will also be partnerships with global brands to foster collaboration with creators using their IPs and content to produce exclusive products and services.     Smart Hotel &      Lifestyle Hotel: Two world-class hotel chains will launch their operations in Thailand for the first time at Cloud 11. Their facilities respond well to the needs of the new generation, startups, investors, and tech executives.     Education: Educational institutes, universities, research centers, and incubation facilities will be active here to develop talent for the creation of content, technologies, and innovations.     Cultural: This zone will present halls for concerts/e-sport events, as well as a black box theater in support of budding creators and artists.     Public Space: Bangkok's largest rooftop park will be here and offer public space where creators can show their potential. Locals can also come to the garden to exercise and relax. This is a creative way to add green space to South Sukhumvit.     Cloud 11, wholly invested and owned by Magnolia Quality Development Corporation Limited (MQDC), spans over 27 rai on Sukhumvit Road near BTS Udomsuk station. Its construction by Thai Obayashi started in 2022. Piling and foundation work have already been completed. Its building construction is now ongoing. Cloud 11 is expected to open in Q4 2024.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818781,AI like Bing and Bard poses billion-dollar search problem,"As Alphabet Inc looks past a chatbot flub that helped erase $100 billion from its market value, another challenge is emerging from its efforts to add generative artificial intelligence to its popular Google Search: the cost.Executives across the technology sector are talking about how to operate AI like ChatGPT while accounting for the high expense. The wildly popular chatbot from OpenAI, which can draft prose and answer search queries, has ""eye-watering"" computing costs of a couple or more cents per conversation, the startup's Chief Executive Sam Altman has said on Twitter.In an interview, Alphabet's Chairman John Hennessy told Reuters that having an exchange with AI known as a large language model likely cost 10 times more than a standard keyword search, though fine-tuning will help reduce the expense quickly.Even with revenue from potential chat-based search ads, the technology could chip into the bottom line of Mountain View, Calif.-based Alphabet with several billion dollars of extra costs, analysts said. Its net income was nearly $60 billion in 2022.Morgan Stanley estimated that Google's 3.3 trillion search queries last year cost roughly a fifth of a cent each, a number that would increase depending on how much text AI must generate. Google, for instance, could face a $6-billion hike in expenses by 2024 if ChatGPT-like AI were to handle half the queries it receives with 50-word answers, analysts projected. Google is unlikely to need a chatbot to handle navigational searches for sites like Wikipedia.Others arrived at a similar bill in different ways. For instance, SemiAnalysis, a research and consulting firm focused on chip technology, said adding ChatGPT-style AI to search could cost Alphabet $3 billion, an amount limited by Google's in-house chips called Tensor Processing Units, or TPUs, along with other optimizations.What makes this form of AI pricier than conventional search is the computing power involved. Such AI depends on billions of dollars of chips, a cost that has to be spread out over their useful life of several years, analysts said. Electricity likewise adds costs and pressure to companies with carbon-footprint goals.The process of handling AI-powered search queries is known as ""inference,"" in which a ""neural network"" loosely modeled on the human brain's biology infers the answer to a question from prior training.In a traditional search, by contrast, Google's web crawlers have scanned the internet to compile an index of information. When a user types a query, Google serves up the most relevant answers stored in the index.Alphabet's Hennessy told Reuters, ""It's inference costs you have to drive down,"" calling that ""a couple year problem at worst.""Alphabet is facing pressure to take on the challenge despite the expense. Earlier this month, its rival Microsoft Corp MSFT.O held a high-profile event at its Redmond, Washington headquarters to show off plans to embed AI chat technology into its Bing search engine, with top executives taking aim at Google's search market share of 91%, by Similarweb's estimate.A day later, Alphabet talked about plans to improve its search engine, but a promotional video for its AI chatbot Bard showed the system answering a question inaccurately, fomenting a stock slide that shaved $100 billion off its market value.Microsoft later drew scrutiny of its own when its AI reportedly made threats or professed love to test users, prompting the company to limit long chat sessions it said ""provoked"" unintended answers.Microsoft's Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood has told analysts that the upside from gaining users and advertising revenue outweighed expenses as the new Bing rolls out to millions of consumers. ""That's incremental gross margin dollars for us, even at the cost to serve that we're discussing,"" she said.And another Google competitor, CEO of search engine You.com Richard Socher, said adding an AI chat experience as well as applications for charts, videos and other generative tech raised expenses between 30% and 50%. ""Technology gets cheaper at scale and over time,"" he said.A source close to Google cautioned it's early to pin down exactly how much chatbots might cost because efficiency and usage vary widely depending on the technology involved, and AI already powers products like search.Still, footing the bill is one of two main reasons why search and social media giants with billions of users have not rolled out an AI chatbot overnight, said Paul Daugherty, Accenture's chief technology officer.""One is accuracy, and the second is you have to scale this in the right way,"" he said.MAKING THE MATH WORKFor years, researchers at Alphabet and elsewhere have studied how to train and run large language models more cheaply.Bigger models require more chips for inference and therefore cost more. AI that dazzles consumers for its human-like authority has ballooned in size, reaching 175 billion so-called parameters, or different values that the algorithm takes into account, for the model OpenAI updated into ChatGPT. Cost also varies by the length of a user's query, as measured in ""tokens"" or pieces of words.One senior technology executive told Reuters that such AI remained cost-prohibitive to put in millions of consumers' hands.""These models are very expensive, and so the next level of invention is going to be reducing the cost of both training these models and inference so that we can use it in every application,"" the executive said on condition of anonymity.For now, computer scientists inside OpenAI have figured out how to optimize inference costs through complex code that makes chips run more efficiently, a person familiar with the effort said. An OpenAI spokesperson did not immediately comment.A longer-term issue is how to shrink the number of parameters in an AI model 10 or even 100 times, without losing accuracy.""How you cull (parameters away) most effectively, that's still an open question,"" said Naveen Rao, who formerly ran Intel Corp's AI chip efforts and now works to lower AI computing costs through his startup MosaicML.In the meantime, some have considered charging for access, like OpenAI's $20 per month subscription for better ChatGPT service. Technology experts also said a workaround is applying smaller AI models to simpler tasks, which Alphabet is exploring.The company said this month a ""smaller model"" version of its massive LaMDA AI technology will power its chatbot Bard, requiring ""significantly less computing power, enabling us to scale to more users.""Asked about chatbots like ChatGPT and Bard, Hennessy said at a conference called TechSurge last week that more focused models, rather than one system doing everything, would help ""tame the cost.""(Reporting By Jeffrey Dastin in Mountain View, Calif. and Stephen Nellis in Sunnyvale, Calif.; Additional reporting by Greg Bensinger; editing by Kenneth Li and Claudia Parsons)",2023/2/23,538,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818785,Strike is off but issues abound in Welsh rugby,"Wales rugby players have ended their threat not to play England in the Six Nations this weekend. The game is definitely on.

            Their employers met their demands by their Wednesday deadline after days of negotiations.

            There was relief all around. The Welsh Rugby Union stood to lose more than 9 million pounds ($10.8 million) in gate takings. Then it was sure to be fined heavily by tournament organizers for failing to honor obligations to broadcasters and sponsors. The team, which was routed in its first two matches, would have conceded championship points to England and an opportunity lost against the opponent it looks forward most to playing — and beating — every year.











            Wales captain Ken Owens still believed the team is ready for the English on Saturday in Cardiff.

            WHAT DID THE PLAYERS WANT?

            One, a say on the Professional Rugby Board, which runs the professional game in Wales. The PRB agreed, and Welsh Rugby Players' Association chief Gareth Lewis will attend. Two, scrapping the 60-cap selection rule, which has since 2017 prevented players outside Wales from being picked if they didn't have that minimum number of test appearances. The caps rule is to be reduced to 25. That immediately helps first-choice lock Will Rowlands, whose move to Racing 92 in Paris next season threatened to make him unavailable for the Rugby World Cup because he's on 23 caps. Three, remove the variable element in the proposed new fixed-variable contracts. The PRB was proposing the end of 100% guaranteed contracts and, instead, making 80% guaranteed and 20% based on bonuses for wins and appearances. The PRB has agreed to give players the option of 100% or 80-20.

            ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL?

            No. All of Welsh rugby is still in a contracts freeze. More than 70 players, including Wales internationals, across the four professional teams — Cardiff, Dragons, Ospreys, Scarlets — come off contract at the end of the season and they are more than anxious. At risk of being without a club in three months, they're unsure whether to keep waiting or consider offers outside of Wales, putting at risk their national team ambitions. At a time when the regions are usually extending contracts or signing new players, nothing has been happening since the start of the year because the regional sides don't have a signed agreement with the Welsh Rugby Union.

            WHY NOT?

            The drawn out negotiations are “complex and nuanced,” the PRB says. The PRB is made up of representatives of the four regions, the WRU, and two independent people. Every year, the PRB produces the Professional Rugby Agreement, which sets the season budget for the four regions and outlines WRU payments for access to players for all Wales squad duties. The budget depends on the WRU's annual income, primarily from staging international matches. In the year to June 2022, the WRU posted a profit of 3.2 million pounds ($3.85 million) on a turnover of 94.3 million pounds ($113.6 million), a near-record amount that wasn't quite what it hoped for: Six Nations home games against France and Italy weren't sellouts, and the fifth-place finish meant a drop in prize money of almost 4 million pounds ($4.8 million). The PRB came to a verbal understanding in December on a new agreement stretching for six years but nothing has been formalized. PRB chair Malcolm Wall apologized to players last weekend for the delay causing “stress and real discomfort.”

            A SIX-YEAR AGREEMENT?

            Everyone wants more certainty further into the future than merely annually. The PRB says it will honor all current contracts for the 2023-24 season, but the salary cap will drop for 2024-25 and the regions should expect to survive rather than thrive to the end of the agreement. The PRB says the WRU and clubs have for years been paying player salaries they cannot afford and Wales cannot live beyond its means any longer. The PRB adds the new agreement offers an average player salary of about 100,000 pounds ($120,000) a year, a new approach on international player release, and a formal framework for contract negotiations across the four regions and the national squad.

            WHAT ANGERS THE PLAYERS?

            A lot. There could be more cash in the pot but when CVC Capital bought a 14.3% stake in the Six Nations two years ago, the WRU decided its 51 million pounds ($61 million) share spread over five years was to go on capital projects such as the Parkgate Hotel next to Principality Stadium. Former WRU chief executive Steve Phillips believed investing the money directly into the regions wasn't the best way to get a return. Phillips resigned last month after allegations of a toxic culture at the WRU. The accusations are being investigated by an independent task force. Meanwhile, the players say their grievance is not about money. It's about the interminable delay in opening contract talks. WRU interim chief executive Nigel Walker apologized to the players on Wednesday and says contracts will start to be offered next week.

            WE'RE ALL GOOD THEN?

            No. The root of Wales' problems — tribalism and governance — are far from resolved. Wales knows it has enjoyed Six Nations success for nearly 20 years despite itself, despite distrust between the national team and the WRU, between the regions and the WRU, between the four regions, and between the community game and the professional game. Moving to four regions in 2003 hasn't worked out. In the European Cup, Scarlets were the last to impress by reaching the 2018 semifinals. Cardiff and Ospreys made the quarterfinals more than a decade ago. Dragons have never advanced from their pool. The chief executive who launched the regions, David Moffett, no longer thinks they're fit for purpose. He backs returning to four traditional clubs to revive public interest, and keeping the professional and community arms separate. Despite the PRB running the pro game, the WRU board has the final say. The board is filled with representatives of amateur clubs. Former captain Sam Warburton says the WRU is over-represented by the community game and “stuck in the Stone Age.” Current captain Ken Owens says, “We can't keep going on this merry-go-round of crisis after crisis because it is affecting everyone in the game. We need to pull together now and find the best way forward ... to put Welsh rugby at the top end of the world rugby, and not the laughingstock.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818786,Dom Capers comes full circle with return to Panthers,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — Shortly after being hired as head coach of the Carolina Panthers 28 years ago, Dom Capers was asked what he planned to do once he reached retirement age.

            Capers smiled and replied, “I want to still be coaching.”

            And he still is, coincidentally enough, with the Panthers.











            The 72-year-old Capers is back for his second stint in Carolina, this time as a senior defensive assistant where he’ll be scouting upcoming opponents’ tendencies and helping defensive coordinator Ejiro Evero formulate a weekly game plan.

            And he can’t wait.

            ""I enjoy the competitiveness, the X and O part of the game,” Capers said Wednesday. “I don't think there is anything that matches Sunday afternoon for three hours after you put in all that work during the week. There is no in between — you either feel real good (if you win) or you don't feel very good at all (if you lose).

            “I don't know what you find to match that when it is all over,” he added.

            It is a full-circle moment for Capers.

            He returns to a franchise he helped usher into the league in 1995 as an expansion team and took to the NFC championship game in just its second season. He spent four seasons in Carolina, compiling a 30-34 record before being fired — a decision that then-owner Jerry Richardson would later say he regretted.

            Capers is now settling back into the stadium where he once spent numerous nights sleeping on a cot in his office after a long day of coaching and game-planning. He's looking forward to returning to the Italian restaurant a couple of blocks away from the stadium, where he would spend his few free moments eating and reading the newspaper in a private booth in the back corner. 

            And he's eager to getting started working for head coach Frank Reich, the Panthers starting quarterback to open their inaugural season.

            Since that one season together, Capers and Reich have stayed in touch and remained friends while developing a mutual respect for one another.

            “I'm not overly sentimental, but that is pretty special,"" Reich said of Capers' return.

            But Reich was quick to add that Capers' homecoming should not be misconstrued as a “sentimental hire.”

            “Not even close,” Reich said. ”This guy is still vibrant with football knowledge, passion and experience. He and Ejiro have an unbelievable relationship and trust and that is just going to benefit our team.""

            Evero first met Capers in 2016 in Green Bay when he was a defensive quality control coach working directly under Capers, the Packers defensive coordinator at the time. Evero would later move on, but left an impression on Capers because of his work ethic.

            Evero never forgot what Capers meant to him either, and when he landed the Denver Broncos defensive coordinator job he called Capers and asked him to join his staff. The Broncos finished ninth in the league in defense in 2022.

            When Evero joined the Panthers earlier this month, Capers agreed to join him.

            “Even though you feel like you're prepared for the job, there are things you don't know until you get in that seat,” Evero said of being an NFL defensive coordinator. “Coach Capers is an incredible guide in terms of how to do the job, and do it at an elite level. He's someone to bounce ideas off of as well. He's a man of great character.""

            Evero and Capers inherit a Carolina defense that finished 22nd in the league last season, but is still considered the strength of the team with core players such as defensive end Brian Burns, defensive tackle Derrick Brown, linebacker Shaq Thompson, safety Jeremy Chinn and cornerback Jaycee Horn.

            They'll be installing a base 3-4 defense, but plan to play to the strengths of their players.

            “This is not my defense,” Evero said. “This is me, our coaches, especially Dom's influence, the players — we are all putting this thing together and we are collaborating to make this the best defense possible. And Dom will be a huge part of that.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818787,Norfolk Southern is third railroad to offer paid sick time,"OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Norfolk Southern on Wednesday became the third major freight railroad to offer some of its employees paid sick time, announcing a deal with one of its unions in response to workers' quality-of life complaints that arose during contract negotiations.

            The agreement to provide about 3,000 track maintenance workers in the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes Division union with sick time offered some positive news for the railroad as it works to clean up the mess after its fiery derailment in eastern Ohio earlier this month.

            BMWED union spokesman Clark Ballew said the sick time will be especially welcome to workers rebuilding the track after the Feb. 3 derailment outside East Palestine, Ohio.











            “It is imperative that they have resources available that keep them safe and healthy at a site that many would be apprehensive to work,” Ballew said. “Paid sick time is one of those resources, but there are several others, and we expect N.S. to start doing right by their employees and the public and afford all resources necessary to not exacerbate an already bad situation.”

            The agreement follows along the same lines as the ones CSX and Union Pacific announced earlier this month. The workers will get four paid sick days a year and have the option to convert three of their personal leave days into sick days. 

            The railroads have been reaching these deals without demanding concessions from the unions. But none of the sick time agreements so far cover train crews that have schedules keeping them on call 24-7. But the railroads have said they are negotiating with all of their unions about this.

            Norfolk Southern President and CEO Alan Shaw said the Atlanta-based railroad is committed to improving workers’ “quality of life in partnership with our union leaders.”

            Concerns about the lack of paid sick time and demanding schedules pushed the industry to the brink of a strike last fall before Congress stepped in to block a walkout and force workers to accept a five-year contract that included 24% raises and $5,000 in bonuses. But the contract didn't address many of their concerns about working conditions.

            The federal Surface Transportation Board praised the railroads that have announced sick time agreements because it said “these types of collaborative efforts to tackle ‘quality of life’ issues should result in the further strengthening of our national rail network by promoting both retention of existing workers and providing incentives for potential new hires.”OMAHA, Neb.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818788,Ferguson Jenkins to be honored with statue in hometown,"CHATHAM, Ontario (AP) — Ferguson Jenkins' hometown will honor the baseball Hall of Famer with a statue.

            Chatham-Kent will unveil a 9-foot bronze figure of the 80-year-old former pitcher on June 10, a replica of the statue by sculptor Lou Cella that was unveiled outside Chicago's Wrigley Field last May.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818789,Michigan asks judge to release man in slayings of 2 hunters,"DETROIT (AP) — The state of Michigan asked a judge Wednesday to release a man who has served nearly 21 years of a life sentence for the fatal shootings of two hunters, saying critical evidence about an Ohio serial killer's possible role was never shared before trial. 

            Jeff Titus' rights were violated by keeping the information suppressed in 2002, the attorney general's office said in a court filing.

            Titus, 71, will be entitled to a new trial, though it's likely that authorities in southwestern Michigan will drop the case.











            Kalamazoo County Prosecutor Jeff Getting said he supports Titus' release from prison but would withhold comment until after U.S. District Judge Paul Borman makes a decision.

            It's an extraordinary turnaround for Titus, whose claim of innocence has been led for years by the Innocence Clinic at University of Michigan law school. 

            Doug Estes and Jim Bennett were fatally shot near Titus’ rural property in 1990, though he wasn't charged until more than a decade later. 

            Authorities at the time had acknowledged that Titus was hunting in another county on the day of the shootings. But they insisted that he still drove home in time to kill the men as trespassers.

            In 2019, the attorney general's conviction integrity unit agreed to look at Titus' case after he lost a string of appeals in state courts.

            Months later, David Moran, who runs the Innocence Clinic, made a stunning discovery at the county sheriff's office: a 30-page file from the original investigation that had referred to an alternate suspect, Thomas Dillon of Magnolia, Ohio.

            The information had never been shared with Titus' trial lawyer or local prosecutors.

            “Dillon was a serial killer who was convicted of killing multiple hunters and outdoorsmen,” Assistant Attorney General John Pallas and Moran said in a joint filing.

            “He was arrested in 1993 and ultimately pleaded guilty to five counts of first-degree murder in Ohio in order to avoid the death penalty,"" they said.

            The state collected other information about Dillon, who died in 2011 at age 61. It learned that the FBI had surveilled him and found that he would drive hundreds of miles from his Ohio home.

            Dillon’s Ohio prison cellmate indicated that Dillon admitted killing two hunters “in a county where no one could prove he had been,” the state said.

            The undisclosed file also revealed that a woman and her son, taken to Ohio by investigators, had identified Dillon as the man in a car in a ditch near the murder scene, the state said.

            Questions about Titus' guilt and Dillon's possible role were extensively reported in 2020 and 2021 by “Undisclosed,” a podcast about wrongful convictions, and the TV networkInvestigation Discovery.

            Follow Ed White at http://twitter.com/edwritezDETROIT (AP) — The state of Michigan asked a judge Wednesday to release a man who has served nearly 21 years of a life sentence for the fatal shootings of two hunters, saying critical evidence about an Ohio serial killer's possible role was never shared before trial.Jeff Titus' rights were violated by keeping the information suppressed in 2002, the attorney general's office said in a court filing.Titus, 71, will be entitled to a new trial, though it's likely that authorities in southwestern Michigan will drop the case.Kalamazoo County Prosecutor Jeff Getting said he supports Titus' release from prison but would withhold comment until after U.S. District Judge Paul Borman makes a decision.It's an extraordinary turnaround for Titus, whose claim of innocence has been led for years by the Innocence Clinic at University of Michigan law school.Doug Estes and Jim Bennett were fatally shot near Titus’ rural property in 1990, though he wasn't charged until more than a decade later.Authorities at the time had acknowledged that Titus was hunting in another county on the day of the shootings. But they insisted that he still drove home in time to kill the men as trespassers.In 2019, the attorney general's conviction integrity unit agreed to look at Titus' case after he lost a string of appeals in state courts.Months later, David Moran, who runs the Innocence Clinic, made a stunning discovery at the county sheriff's office: a 30-page file from the original investigation that had referred to an alternate suspect, Thomas Dillon of Magnolia, Ohio.The information had never been shared with Titus' trial lawyer or local prosecutors.“Dillon was a serial killer who was convicted of killing multiple hunters and outdoorsmen,” Assistant Attorney General John Pallas and Moran said in a joint filing.“He was arrested in 1993 and ultimately pleaded guilty to five counts of first-degree murder in Ohio in order to avoid the death penalty,"" they said.The state collected other information about Dillon, who died in 2011 at age 61.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818797,Google tests blocking news content for some Canadians,"OTTAWA, Ontario (AP) — Google is blocking some Canadian users from viewing news content in what the company said Wednesday is a test run of a potential response to a Canadian government’s online news bill. 

            Bill C-18, the Online News Act, would require digital giants such as Google and Meta, which owns Facebook, to negotiate deals that would compensate Canadian media companies for republishing their content on their platforms.

            The company said it is temporarily limiting access to news content for under 4% of its Canadian users as it assesses possible responses to the bill. The change applies to its ubiquitous search engine as well as the Discover feature on Android devices, which carries news and sports stories.











            All types of news content are being affected by the test, which will run for about five weeks, the company said. That includes content created by Canadian broadcasters and newspapers.

            “We’re briefly testing potential product responses to Bill C-18 that impact a very small percentage of Canadian users,” Google spokesman Shay Purdy said in a written statement on Wednesday in response to questions from The Canadian Press. 

            The company runs thousands of tests each year to assess any potential changes to its search engine, he added.

            “We’ve been fully transparent about our concern that C-18 is overly broad and, if unchanged, could impact products Canadians use and rely on every day,” Purdy said.

            A spokeswoman for Canadian Heritage Minister Pablo Rodriguez said Canadians will not be intimidated and called it disappointing that Google is borrowing from Meta’s playbook. Last year, that company threatened to block news off its site in response to the bill.

            “This didn’t work in Australia, and it won’t work here because Canadians won’t be intimidated. At the end of the day, all we’re asking the tech giants to do is compensate journalists when they use their work,” spokeswoman Laura Scaffidi said in a statement Wednesday.

            “Canadians need to have access to quality, fact-based news at the local and national levels, and that’s why we introduced the Online News Act. Tech giants need to be more transparent and accountable to Canadians.”

            Rodriguez has argued the bill, which is similar to a law that Australia passed in 2021, will “enhance fairness” in the digital news marketplace by creating a framework and bargaining process for online behemoths to pay media outlets.

            But Google expressed concerns in a Parliament committee that the prospective law does not require publishers to adhere to basic journalistic standards, that it would favour large publishers over smaller outlets and that it could result in the proliferation of “cheap, low quality, clickbait content” over public interest journalism. 

            The company has said it would rather pay into a fund, similar to the Canada Media Fund, that would pay news publishers indirectly. 

            The bill passed the Canadian House of Commons in December and is set to be studied in the Senate in the coming months.OTTAWA, Ontario (AP) — Google is blocking some Canadian users from viewing news content in what the company said Wednesday is a test run of a potential response to a Canadian government’s online news bill.Bill C-18, the Online News Act, would require digital giants such as Google and Meta, which owns Facebook, to negotiate deals that would compensate Canadian media companies for republishing their content on their platforms.The company said it is temporarily limiting access to news content for under 4% of its Canadian users as it assesses possible responses to the bill.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818798,Willie Taggart hired as Ravens' running backs coach,"OWINGS MILLS, Md. (AP) — The Baltimore Ravens hired Willie Taggart as their running backs coach on Wednesday.

            The 46-year-old Taggart has served as head coach at five Division I programs, most recently at Florida Atlantic, where he went 33-15 from 2020-22. Before that, he was the coach at Florida State (2018-19), Oregon (2017), South Florida (2013-16) and Western Kentucky (2010-12).

            Taggart has also been an assistant at Stanford and Western Kentucky. He was the Hilltoppers' starting quarterback from 1995-98 and rushed for 3,997 yards and 47 touchdowns.











            “He has a proven track record for developing players as a position coach, as an offensive coordinator and as a head coach,” Ravens coach John Harbaugh said in a statement. “A leader and a highly effective motivator, Willie’s reputation for building strong relationships with his players and fellow coaches will serve our offense well moving forward.”

            The Ravens also announced Wednesday that Tee Martin has moved from wide receivers coach to quarterbacks coach and that Scott Elliott has been promoted to strength and conditioning coordinator. Elliott replaces Steve Saunders, who is no longer with the organization.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818799,"Foes present signatures, seek New Orleans mayor recall vote","NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Opponents of New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell rushed 10 boxes of petitions into City Hall on Wednesday and declared they have enough enough signatures to force a recall of the second-term mayor.

            The boxes arrived less than an hour before closing time at the registrar of voters' office, just meeting the deadline after a six-month drive. 

            An election to remove New Orleans' first woman mayor isn't a sure thing, however. The required number of signatures has been a moving, uncertain target. Neither Eileen Carter nor Belden Batiste, two of the founders of the effort, would say exactly how many signatures were turned in Wednesday. Carter did provide a clue. 











            “We have more signatures than the mayor got votes,” she said. 

            Cantrell, who was first elected in 2018, won re-election easily in a low-turnout contest in November 2021, when she received 48,750 votes. 

            Her second term has been plagued by myriad problems — among them stubborn violent crime, fitful progress on major street projects that have left some city streets a mess and unreliable garbage collection. Questions also have been raised about her personal use of a city-owned apartment.

            Petition organizers say she further hurt her own cause when she was seen on a widely circulated social media video showing her gesturing with her middle finger to a passing Mardi Gras parade. The reason for the gesture — whether she was offended by a float theme or by something done or said by a rider — is unclear and the city has said little about it.

            “This administration is a gift that keeps on giving,” Carter said.

            Cantrell's communications director, Gregory Joseph, declined to comment on the drive. “We're just going to keep on doing the work,” he said, repeating a response Cantrell has repeatedly given during the recall drive. 

            The mayor has said crime is a nationwide problem that took hold during the COVID-19 pandemic. And administration officials have said they're taking steps to improve the street and garbage issues.

            How many valid signatures will be needed is in question. Initially, organizers were seeking in excess of 52,000 signatures, based on state figures showing more than 264,000 registered voters. But research led to the target being lowered to somewhere between 49,000 and 50,000 because some of the voters are deemed inactive for reasons such as not having voted in multiple elections.

            Recall organizers have gone to court to have the number lowered even further. They say the Orleans Parish voter registrar has failed to cull hundreds of dead voters from the active rolls — and close to 30,000 people who have moved from the city. That could lower the threshold by around 6,000 voters. 

            Even as their lawsuit plays out, they are hoping to have a spring election. The registrar has 20 days to certify signatures and then, if enough are verified, send it to Gov. John Bel Edwards. Edwards would have 15 days to set an election. It's possible a recall could go on the state's April 29 ballot. But, there are numerous unknowns — including how many signatures will or won't be deemed legitimate, and any legal challenges Cantrell might make. 

            Cantrell supporters, early in the recall drive, cast it as an attempt by Republicans to attack a Black woman mayor and Democrat. However, Carter is a prominent Democrat and she stressed that support for the drive has been bipartisan and multiracial.NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Opponents of New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell rushed 10 boxes of petitions into City Hall on Wednesday and declared they have enough enough signatures to force a recall of the second-term mayor.The boxes arrived less than an hour before closing time at the registrar of voters' office, just meeting the deadline after a six-month drive.An election to remove New Orleans' first woman mayor isn't a sure thing, however.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818800,Former Arizona AG sat on records refuting election fraud,"PHOENIX (AP) — Arizona's former attorney general suppressed findings by his investigators who concluded there was no basis for allegations that the 2020 election was marred by widespread fraud, according to documents released Wednesday by his successor.

            Democratic Attorney General Kris Mayes, who took office last month, said the records show the 2020 election “was conducted fairly and accurately by election officials.”

            Previous Attorney General Mark Brnovich, a Republican, never released a March 2022 summary of investigative findings, which ruled out most of the fraud claims spread by allies and supporters of former President Donald Trump. Yet a month later, he released an “interim report"" that claimed his investigation “revealed serious vulnerabilities that must be addressed and raises questions about the 2020 election in Arizona.""











            He released his April report despite pushback from his investigators who said some of its claims were refuted by their probe. Brnovich was at the time in the midst of a Republican Party primary for U.S. Senate and facing fierce criticism from Trump, who claimed he wasn't doing enough to prosecute election fraud. 

            Brnovich, whose primary bid was unsuccessful, also did not release a September memo that systematically refuted a bevy of election conspiracies that have taken root on the right, including allegations of dead or duplicate voters, pre-marked ballots flown in from Asia, election servers connected to the internet and even manipulation by satellites controlled by the Italian military. 

            “In each instance and in each matter, the aforementioned parties did not provide any evidence to support their allegations,” the September memo read. “The information that was provided was speculative in many instances and when investigated by our agents and support staff, was found to be inaccurate.”

            The September memo, which was among the documents released Wednesday, describes an all-encompassing probe that became the top priority for the attorney general's investigators, who spent more than 10,000 hours looking into 638 complaints. They opened 430 investigations and referred 22 cases for prosecution. President Joe Biden won Arizona by a little over 10,000 votes.

            Mayes said the fraud claims were a waste.

            “The ten thousand plus hours spent diligently investigating every conspiracy theory under the sun distracted this office from its core mission of protecting the people of Arizona from real crime and fraud,"" Mayes said in a statement. 

            Attempts to reach Brnovich for comment were unsuccessful.

            Brnovich's “interim report” claimed that election officials worked too quickly in verifying voter signatures and pointed to a drop in the number of ballots with rejected signatures between 2016 and 2018 and again in 2020. He also claimed that Maricopa County was slow in responding to requests for information.

            He made those claims even after investigators who reviewed a draft pushed back, publishing his report largely unchanged following their feedback.

            The investigative staff concluded that the county recorder's office “followed its policy/procedures as they relate to signature verification; we did not uncover any criminality or fraud having been committed in this area during the 2020 general election,"" investigators wrote. They also said they found the county “was cooperative and responsive to our requests.”

            Arizona became the epicenter of efforts by Trump allies to cast doubt on Biden's victory. Republican leaders of the state Senate subpoenaed election records and equipment and hired a Florida firm led by a Trump supporter, Cyber Ninjas Inc., to conduct an unprecedented review of the election in Maricopa County.

            The Cyber Ninjas review gave Biden more votes than the official count but claimed that their work raised serious questions about the conduct of the election in Maricopa County, home to metro Phoenix and the majority of Arizona's voters. The investigation by the attorney general's office found the allegations did not stand up to scrutiny.

            “Our comprehensive review of CNI’s audit showed they did not provide any evidence to support their allegations of widespread fraud or ballot manipulation,” Brnovich's investigators wrote.

            Thursday's release is the latest confirmation that there was no widespread fraud in the 2020 election and that Biden won the presidency legitimately. Trump continues to repeat his lie that the election was stolen from him as he mounts his third bid for the White House, despite reviews and audits saying otherwise in the battleground states he contested and his own administration officials debunking his claims.

            Officials in Maricopa County, where nearly all the officials overseeing elections are Republicans, say they endured death threats and verbal abuse due to the suggestions of malfeasance in the Cyber Ninjas review and Brnovich's “interim report.""

            “This was a gross misuse of his elected office and an appalling waste of taxpayer dollars, as well as a waste of the time and effort of professional investigators,” Clint Hickman, the Republican chairman of the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors said in a statement.

            Brnovich's investigators did conclude that Maricopa County officials did not uniformly follow state election procedures when filling out forms to document the pickup and transport of mail ballots. But they said the errors were procedural and that “investigators did not find anything that would (have) compromised the integrity of the ballots or the final ballot count.”

            Investigators interviewed two Republican state lawmakers who publicly claimed they knew of fraud in the election, but wrote that neither Rep. Mark Finchem nor Sen. Sonny Borrelli repeated their claims to investigators — when they could have been subject to criminal charges for false reporting to law enforcement.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818801,"Jimmy Carter receives accolades from afar, and right at home","PLAINS, Ga. (AP) — Chad Loshbaugh and his seventh-grade son, Theo, were starting a historical tour for their winter break when they heard that former President Jimmy Carter had begun end-of-life care at home. 

            So the father-son pair from Albany, New York, changed their itinerary and found themselves Wednesday on the Carter family farm in Plains, where the 39th president grew up and about a mile from the one-story house where the 98-year-old now is receiving hospice care.

            “This was an add-on,” to a civil rights trip that is taking them from Atlanta through several stops in Alabama, Loshbaugh said. “We thought it was important to change our trip to see the site here and pay our respects to President Carter.”











            The longest-lived American president is garnering accolades and well-wishes from across the world — from other public leaders and admirers he's never met — as well as from family and friends in his hometown, where he and his wife are known as “Mr. Jimmy” and “Ms. Rosalynn.” 

            “It’s just surreal to think about it all,” said Carter's niece Kim Fuller, who runs Friends of Jimmy Carter, headquartered down the street from the former first couple’s home. 

            News of Carter's condition prompted an uptick in visitors to Plains, a town of about 700 with just a few blocks of retail businesses along the railroad tracks that run by Carter’s 1976 presidential headquarters. 

            Plains residents have always been proud of the Carters' ascension to the White House, Fuller said, as well as the couple’s work afterward on public health, conflict resolution and democracy via The Carter Center in Atlanta. There, the Carters and their programs have monitored elections in at least 113 countries and, among other things, nearly eradicated the Guinea worm parasite in the developing world.

            Those accomplishments have drawn plaudits from people such as Mark Suzman, CEO of the Gates Foundation.

            “President Carter’s dedication to making the world a better place has had a lasting impact on countless lives through the @CarterCenter,” Suzman tweeted Wednesday. “Thank you Pres. Carter for your decades of leadership, service, & wisdom — the future is brighter because of your work.”

            Former President Bill Clinton, a fellow Democrat elected 12 years after Carter’s single term ended with a landslide defeat in 1980, marked Presidents Day on Monday by wishing Carter well and tweeting out a picture of the pair, who were both Southern governors before their presidencies. 

            Thousands also have posted personal messages on The Carter Center’s website.

            “Dear President Carter, You are the best of us. You always sought the best for our country, and for the world,” wrote Mary Cullen.

            Back in Plains, Fuller said it’s “hard right now” to think about Carter eventually not being around. “But it’s good to see people coming through,” she added.

            Fuller, who took over teaching her uncle's Sunday School lessons at Maranatha Baptist Church after he grew frail, said it was a regular occurrence over the years to see the former first couple walking down the street.

            “They’ve been so accessible,” she said. “That’s just who they are, and he was like that in the White House. Never forgot where he came from — and he came back home when he was done.”

            Carter’s Presidential Library and Museum, located on the same campus as The Carter Center near downtown Atlanta, also has seen an increase in interest this week.

            Jennifer Multani, who visited from California, said she gained a new appreciation for his life, including his time in office and experiences before entering politics. 

            “His service after the presidency was extraordinary, no question about it,” she said. “We all need to learn from it to give back to humanity as much as we can.""

            She said he “inherited turbulent times” but still negotiated a peace deal between Israel and Egypt. The leaders of those nations shared the Nobel Peace Prize. Carter received the award in 2002.

            Sheri Clayton, a 65-year-old visiting from Houston, remembers Carter’s presidency well, with the late 1970s being dominated by inflation, rising interest rates and the Iran hostage situation. Carter made some decisions, including appointing Paul Volcker as Federal Reserve chairman, that would help the economy rebound — but not until after his defeat to Republican Ronald Reagan. He also eventually freed the 52 Americans being held in Tehran, after the November election.

            “The feeling that I get about Jimmy Carter was that he had a good heart and ... he is for the people,” Clayton said.

            Walking along the paths outside Carter’s boyhood home, Loshbaugh said what is perhaps most striking to him is that the same man who accomplished so much got his start, both in life and in politics, where he did.

            “To come from such humble, rural beginnings,” Loshbaugh said, “it’s compelling to think about. 

            ""His tenure was just one term. But what he did with his life after — it’s just tremendous in building not only his legacy, but showing what a president do for the country and how they should use their position for their entire lives.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818802,Lawsuit: Steve Bannon owes $480K for unpaid legal bills,"NEW YORK (AP) — Steve Bannon’s latest legal trouble: a lawsuit alleging he stiffed his former lawyers out of more than $480,000.

            Bannon, a conservative strategist and longtime ally of former President Donald Trump, was sued for breach of contract last week by a Manhattan law firm that defended him in several recent high-profile legal battles.

            The firm, Davidoff Hutcher & Citron LLP, represented Bannon from 2020 to 2022 in matters including criminal cases stemming from his refusal to comply with a congressional subpoena and from allegations that he duped donors who gave money to build a wall on the southern U.S. border.











            The firm said it also aided Bannon in obtaining a presidential pardon just before Trump left office in 2021.

            Davidoff Hutcher & Citron said in its lawsuit that Bannon racked up a bill totaling more than $855,000 but that he has only paid $375,000, in violation of his retainer agreement.

            The firm is seeking payment of $480,487, plus interest and legal costs for its lawsuit against Bannon.

            Messages seeking comment were left for Bannon.

            Trump’s pardon, in January 2021, forced federal prosecutors to drop Bannon from a criminal case involving the “We Build the Wall” fundraising campaign. Manhattan prosecutors revived the matter in September with state-level charges, which aren't covered by presidential pardons.

            Bannon, 69, has pleaded not guilty to money laundering, conspiracy, fraud and other charges.

            The New York case is pending with yet more legal drama: Bannon has until next week to find new lawyers after his current attorneys, who are not affiliated with Davidoff Hutcher & Citron, said they have “irreconcilable” differences about how to proceed.

            Bannon is accused of falsely promising donors that all money given to “We Build the Wall” would go to building a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, instead using the funds to enrich people involved in the project. Prosecutors say Bannon was involved in transferring hundreds of thousands of dollars to third-party entities and using them to funnel payments to two other people involved in the scheme.

            The Manhattan indictment didn’t identify those people by name, but the details match those of Brian Kolfage and Andrew Badolato, who pleaded guilty to federal charges in April. A third defendant, Timothy Shea, was convicted in October.

            Bannon was convicted last July of contempt for defying a subpoena from the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. He was sentenced in October to four months in jail. But he remains free while he appeals.

            Bannon, a former U.S. Navy officer and Harvard MBA, worked as an investment banker at Goldman Sachs and as a Hollywood producer before turning to politics. One of his most notable deals left him with a share of “Seinfeld” royalties. 

            He took over the conservative news site Breitbart News in 2012, had a leading role in the late stages of Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and worked in the White House for about seven months as Trump's chief strategist. He now hosts a pro-Trump podcast called “Bannon's War Room.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818804,7 essential cybersecurity tips for international travel,"Cybersecurity measures should be on top of the what-to-bring-with-you list when preparing for travel, either for business or for tourism. OctaFX security experts give seven crucial cybersecurity tips to keep your data and finances safe while on the go.

KUALA LUMPUR, MALAYSIA -  Media OutReach - 23 February 2023 - International travel is often an exciting opportunity for cultural exploration or a necessity for conducting business. Either way, it is quite easy to focus on the entertaining or professional aspects of the trip and overlook the cybersecurity matters, which may lead to a loss of important data or money. In this article, you will find seven essential tips OctaFX prepared for international travellers.            Keep your devices secure   Use strong passwords and lock your laptop, phone, and other devices when not in use. You should also be cautious when using public Wi-Fi in airports, hotels, restaurants and other places. These networks can often be insecure and leave you vulnerable to hacking attempts.   There are several types of cyberattacks that involve public Wi-Fi networks. For instance, some networks do not use encryption, meaning that hackers can intercept the data transmitted over them. Hackers sometimes set up their own Wi-Fi networks that sound the same as legitimate ones. Once you are connected, the hacker may steal your personal information or infect your computer with malware. The third type of Wi-Fi cyberattack involves criminals tricking you into downloading malicious software by implying that it is something you must do to get access to a free public network.   Avoid using publicly accessible computers and USB charging stations   Computers that you can use in hotels, business centres, airports, and other public spaces might be infected with malware that can steal your credentials or credit card information by capturing keystrokes. Do not enter any sensitive information on such devices. If you absolutely have to log in to some of your accounts, do it in incognito mode and log out of the accounts afterwards.   Public USB charging stations might be just as unsafe to use, with criminals putting malware or spyware on them to then get access to your finances and personal data. To protect your devices from this threat, use USB data blockers—they are designed to physically block data pins but do not interrupt the charging.            Backup important data   When travelling, backup copies of your passport and other travel documents, as well as financial and personal information. Store your backup data on an encrypted external hard drive or in a secure cloud storage service, and make sure to update it regularly. This way, if your devices are lost or stolen, you will have a backup of all your important information.   Keep software up-to-date   Keep all software up-to-date for all of your devices, as the updates usually contain important security patches that make it harder for hackers to exploit their vulnerabilities. Update your software before travelling to avoid using potentially corrupted networks during the trip.   Beware of skimming   Skimming is a type of theft in which a device is attached to an ATM or other electronic payment system to steal credit card information. Skimming is a particular risk when travelling, as criminals often target tourists who may be less aware of the dangers. To protect yourself from skimming when travelling, avoid any suspicious devices involved with your electronic payments. If you need to use an ATM, choose the one located at a bank office.            Be cautious of QR codes    Criminals may create  fake QR codes that look similar to legitimate ones and then place them on posters, signs, or even menus in cafés. When scanned, these fake QR codes can install malware on your device or direct you to a phishing website where your personal and financial information can be stolen. Be cautious when scanning codes from unknown sources, and try to avoid scanning them if there is a safe option of getting the same information.   Research tour operators and accommodations   Unscrupulous operators offer seemingly legitimate tours and activities at a low cost. Some of those offerings may be either subpar or virtually non-existent. To protect yourself from fraudulent tour operators when travelling, research the company and the tour beforehand, read reviews from previous customers, and only book through reputable sources. Some accommodations even on generally reliable websites turn out to be fake or have artificially inflated ratings, so make your own research for every booking to ensure your stay is not ruined by fraudsters.   It's essential to take proactive steps to secure your personal and financial information while travelling. Whether it's keeping your devices secure, protecting your online accounts, or being mindful of your physical surroundings, these cybersecurity tips can help ensure that your travels are safe and enjoyable.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818814,Chiney Ogwumike re-signs with Los Angeles Sparks,"Chiney Ogwumike re-signed with the Los Angeles Sparks on Wednesday.

            The two-time WNBA All-Star enters her seventh season in the league and fourth with the Sparks. 

            “Chiney is a key returning veteran for the Sparks,” general manager Karen Bryant said. “We are grateful to have her continued leadership and frontcourt presence on our team.”











            Los Angeles acquired Ogwumike before the 2019 season in a trade with Connecticut. She reunites with former Sun coach Curt Miller, who's preparing for his first season coaching the Sparks.

            “I am so happy to re-sign with the Sparks,” Ogwumike said. “The past two seasons here have been the hardest of my basketball career, but I am motivated and inspired for this season to mark a new chapter for the Sparks and me. Reuniting with Curt, the coach that helped me be an All-Star in 2018, who knows my fight and journey on the court, means the world to me.""

            Ogwumike has averaged 11.8 points, 6.7 rebounds and one steal per game in her career. She was taken first in the 2014 draft by the Sun and won Rookie of the Year that season.

            “I am excited to be reunited with Chiney here in Los Angeles,” Miller said. “Chiney is a highly productive and efficient player who also fits the culture that we want to establish in the locker room. She plays with a great motor and will provide valued energy to our team. Her offensive efficiency and defensive versatility will help us on both ends of the floor.”

            Ogwumike's sister, Nneka, is expected to also re-sign with the Sparks soon.

            Off the court, Ogwumike recently signed a contract extension with ESPN, where she serves as a co-host of “NBA Today” and as an analyst on “NBA Countdown.”Chiney Ogwumike re-signed with the Los Angeles Sparks on Wednesday.The two-time WNBA All-Star enters her seventh season in the league and fourth with the Sparks.“Chiney is a key returning veteran for the Sparks,” general manager Karen Bryant said. “We are grateful to have her continued leadership and frontcourt presence on our team.”Los Angeles acquired Ogwumike before the 2019 season in a trade with Connecticut.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818815,"Authorities: TV reporter, girl fatally shot in Florida","A central Florida television journalist and a little girl were fatally shot Wednesday afternoon near the scene of a fatal shooting from earlier in the day, authorities said.

            Orange County Sheriff John Mina said during a news conference that they’ve detained Keith Melvin Moses, 19, who they believe is responsible for both shootings in the Orlando-area neighborhood. 

            Besides the Spectrum News 13 journalist and the 9-year-old girl, a TV crewmember and the girl’s mother were wounded during the second shooting. They were in critical condition at a local hospital.











            “I want to acknowledge what a horrible day this has been for our community and our media partners,” Mina told a room full of reporters. “I work closely with all of you and know many of you and know the very difficult job that you do and also the very important job that you do for our community and for law enforcement. No one in our community — not a mother, not a 9-year-old and certainly not news professionals — should become the victim of gun violence in our community.”

            Mina said they don’t immediately have a motive for any of the shootings.

            “So, the suspect is not saying much right now,” Mina said. “It is unclear if he knew they were news media or not. We’re still trying to work all that out.”

            Mina said the News 13 vehicle did not look like a typical news van with TV station markings. 

            Deputies had initially responded to the Pine Hills area, just northwest of Orlando, on Wednesday morning following reports of a woman in her 20s being shot. 

            Moses ""was an acquaintance of the woman this morning, but as far as we know, had no connection to the reporters and no connection to the mother and the 9-year-old,” Mina said.

            According to witnesses, a man approached the news vehicle later Wednesday and opened fire, hitting the two reporters. The man then walked to a nearby home and shot the mother and daughter. 

            WFTV crews, who were also reporting on the morning shooting, tried to give medical aid to the Spectrum 13 journalists.

            Mina said Moses is already facing a murder charge for the initial victim, and charges are expected soon for the other four victims. Moses’ criminal history includes gun charges, as well as aggravated battery, assault with a deadly weapon, burglary and grand theft offenses, the sheriff said.

            “Our hearts go out to the family of the journalist killed today and the crew member injured in Orange County, Florida, as well as the whole Spectrum News team,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said on Twitter.

            Spectrum News 13 was not identifying the crew members who were involved in the shooting, according to a story on the TV station’s website.

            “Please, please, say a prayer tonight for our co-worker who is in critical condition. And while you’re at it, please say a prayer for every victim of gun violence in this country,” Spectrum 13 journalist Celeste Springer said during her live on-air report.

            Worldwide 40 journalists were reported killed last year, plus another two this year before Wednesday, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. Only one of those was in the United States.

            Jeff German, who covered politics and corruption for the Las Vegas Review-Journal, was found dead outside of his home in September after being stabbed multiple times. Former Clark County Public Administrator Robert Telles, who had been a frequent subject of German’s reporting, has pleaded not guilty to a murder charge.

            In 2015, Virginia reporter Alison Parker and cameraman Adam Ward were shot and killed during their live TV broadcast for CBS affiliate WDBJ7. The suspect, a former reporter for the TV station, died by suicide during the law enforcement search for him.

We’re still trying to work all that out.”Mina said the News 13 vehicle did not look like a typical news van with TV station markings.Deputies had initially responded to the Pine Hills area, just northwest of Orlando, on Wednesday morning following reports of a woman in her 20s being shot.Moses ""was an acquaintance of the woman this morning, but as far as we know, had no connection to the reporters and no connection to the mother and the 9-year-old,” Mina said.According to witnesses, a man approached the news vehicle later Wednesday and opened fire, hitting the two reporters. The man then walked to a nearby home and shot the mother and daughter.WFTV crews, who were also reporting on the morning shooting, tried to give medical aid to the Spectrum 13 journalists.Mina said Moses is already facing a murder charge for the initial victim, and charges are expected soon for the other four victims. Moses’ criminal history includes gun charges, as well as aggravated battery, assault with a deadly weapon, burglary and grand theft offenses, the sheriff said.“Our hearts go out to the family of the journalist killed today and the crew member injured in Orange County, Florida, as well as the whole Spectrum News team,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said on Twitter.Spectrum News 13 was not identifying the crew members who were involved in the shooting, according to a story on the TV station’s website.“Please, please, say a prayer tonight for our co-worker who is in critical condition. And while you’re at it, please say a prayer for every victim of gun violence in this country,” Spectrum 13 journalist Celeste Springer said during her live on-air report.Worldwide 40 journalists were reported killed last year, plus another two this year before Wednesday, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. Only one of those was in the United States.Jeff German, who covered politics and corruption for the Las Vegas Review-Journal, was found dead outside of his home in September after being stabbed multiple times. Former Clark County Public Administrator Robert Telles, who had been a frequent subject of German’s reporting, has pleaded not guilty to a murder charge.In 2015, Virginia reporter Alison Parker and cameraman Adam Ward were shot and killed during their live TV broadcast for CBS affiliate WDBJ7. The suspect, a former reporter for the TV station, died by suicide during the law enforcement search for him.___Associated Press writer Stefanie Dazio in Los Angeles contributed to this report.",2023/2/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818816,"Blackhawks acquire D-man Nikita Zaitsev, picks from Senators","DALLAS (AP) — The Chicago Blackhawks have acquired Nikita Zaitsev and draft picks from the Ottawa Senators for future considerations in what amounts to a salary dump ahead of the NHL trade deadline.

            The teams announced the deal Wednesday prior to the Blackhawks' game at the Dallas Stars. Chicago got a 2023 second-round pick and 2026 fourth in exchange for taking on the remainder of Zaitsev’s contract.

            “We’re pleased to afford Nikita a fresh start,"" Senators general manager Pierre Dorion said in a statement. ""He’s a pro’s pro who showcased himself to be a caring teammate and quiet leader throughout his Sens tenure. We’re thankful for his time in Ottawa and wish he and his family the best in his next chapter.”











            Zaitsev, 31, is signed through next season at a salary cap hit of $4.5 million. Last-place Chicago now has the ability to flip the Russian defenseman to another team before the March 3 trade deadline or at any time over the next year.

            For now, the Blackhawks are keeping him.

            “Nikita gives us added depth on the right side, and we anticipate him joining us soon,"" Blackhawks GM Kyle Davidson said. “We are getting an NHL caliber defenseman and acquiring very valuable draft capital in this upcoming draft and beyond.""

            The trade came hours after Vegas and Arizona also made a cap-related deal, with the Golden Knights sending the contract of retired 37-year-old Shea Weber and a draft pick to the Coyotes for defenseman Dysin Mayo.

            Zaitsev has five goals in 28 games this season. He has 110 points in 444 NHL regular-season and playoff games with the Toronto Maple Leafs and Senators.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818818,Search on Philippine volcano confirms 4 died in plane crash,"MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Searchers who hiked the slopes of a restive Philippine volcano to find the wreckage of a plane that crashed over the weekend confirmed the two Australian energy consultants and two Filipino crew members on board didn't survive, the local mayor said.

            More than a dozen army troops and firefighters were dropped off from an air force helicopter Wednesday morning, then they hiked to the crash site on a gully on Mayon volcano’s slope, civil aviation officials said. The Cessna 340 went missing after taking off Saturday.

            “There were no survivors,” Mayor Carlos Baldo of Albay province’s Camalig town told The Associated Press in a cellphone message when asked about the fate of the four people onboard the plane. The remains of the crash victims would be brought down the volcano on Thursday, he said. 











            The two Australians were working as consultants for Energy Development Corp., a large geothermal power company, which owned the plane that was flown by a Filipino pilot with a crew member. The company deployed teams backed by helicopters and drones to help in the search, which was hampered by heavy rains, gusty wind and thick clouds.

            Australian Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles, who was in Manila on Wednesday for talks with Philippine officials, expressed his condolences to the families of the crash victims before the deaths were confirmed by Baldo later in the day. The mayor oversaw the search for the Cessna aircraft by nearly 200 army troops, firefighters and volunteers, including veteran mountaineers.

            “Can I just express my condolences to both Australian and Filipino families of those who died in the very tragic plane accident?” Marles asked Philippine defense chief Carlito Galvez Jr. in a news conference in Manila. 

            He thanked all those who helped in the search, including two soldiers who were shot and killed by suspected communist guerrillas on Monday while buying supplies in a market in Camalig, military officials said.

            “It is a moment where the really personal nature of the relationship between our two countries is very manifest and felt very profoundly,” said Marles, who also serves as Australia’s defense minister.

            Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Thursday reiterated Marles’ words of condolences and thanks.

            “I do ... want to thank the search teams who traveled into a relatively remote area in dangerous circumstances and weather ... in order to undertake this task,” Albanese told reporters in the South Australia state capital, Adelaide.

            “My heart goes out to people who were there visiting the Philippines who tragically won’t return to their families,” he added.

            Albanese said the Australians killed were men who lived in Adelaide. He provided no other details about them. Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade officials were offering their families consular assistance, he said.

            Contact with the plane was lost a few minutes after it took off from Albay’s international airport Saturday morning for the hourlong flight to the capital, Manila. The wreckage was spotted in an aerial search on Sunday on the slope of the 8,077-foot (2,462-meter) volcano but an air force helicopter only managed to ferry the search team near the crash site Wednesday morning after the weather improved, officials said.

            Only the tail section of the plane remained intact with the rest of the wreckage scattered on the barren upper slopes of the volcano, said Eric Apolonio, spokesperson of the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines.

            Villagers are normally prohibited from entering a permanent danger zone 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) around the volcano, which last erupted in 2018, displacing tens of thousands of people. 

            But the volcano-monitoring agency allowed the high-risk search and rescue effort on Mayon, one of the country's 24 most active volcanoes, with a warning for the team members to be alert for sudden emission of volcanic ash and gas or sudden mudflows if rain fell on the slopes.MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Searchers who hiked the slopes of a restive Philippine volcano to find the wreckage of a plane that crashed over the weekend confirmed the two Australian energy consultants and two Filipino crew members on board didn't survive, the local mayor said.More than a dozen army troops and firefighters were dropped off from an air force helicopter Wednesday morning, then they hiked to the crash site on a gully on Mayon volcano’s slope, civil aviation officials said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818819,Alaska House censures GOP lawmaker over child abuse comments,"JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) — An Alaska lawmaker with a history of incendiary remarks was censured by the state House Wednesday after he said it has been argued that cases of fatal child abuse can be a “cost savings” because the child won't need related government services.

            The House voted 35-1 to censure Republican Rep. David Eastman of Wasilla, with Eastman the lone dissent. Eastman was previously censured, in 2017, over comments he made suggesting there are women in Alaska who try to get pregnant to get a “free trip to the city” for abortions.

            During a committee hearing Monday on adverse childhood experiences, Eastman asked the testifier how he would respond “to the argument that I have heard on occasion where in the case where child abuse is fatal, obviously it’s not good for the child, but it’s actually a benefit to society” because there is not a need for government services that child would otherwise be entitled to if they had lived.











            The testifier, Trevor Storrs, president and CEO of the Alaska Children's Trust, asked Eastman to repeat what he'd said. “Did you say, ‘a benefit for society?’”

            “Talking dollars,” Eastman said, referencing a figure in a document provided to the committee that was related to costs associated with neglect and abuse. Eastman said it “gets argued periodically that it’s actually a cost savings because that child is not going to need any of those government services that they might otherwise be entitled to receive and need based on growing up in this type of environment.”

            Storrs called the loss of a child unmeasurable.

            Rep. Andrew Gray, an Anchorage Democrat who brought the censure motion Wednesday, said Eastman should be censured for “offensive, insulting and unsubstantiated statements that undermine the dignity of the House.” Gray said he also was speaking as a parent.

            Eastman said Gray impugned his motives and character and labeled as outrageous and unacceptable any suggestion that he or members of his district “support child abuse when I’ve staked my entire political career arguing for the opposite.” 

            The House is controlled by a Republican-led majority. The predominantly Democratic minority also includes independents and a Republican. Eastman is not part of either caucus. 

            He has at times butted heads with Republicans, even being removed late last session from the then-Republican minority caucus and from two committees. 

            He last year easily won reelection in his district and withstood a challenge to his eligibility to serve in the Legislature over his ties to the far-right group Oath Keepers.JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) — An Alaska lawmaker with a history of incendiary remarks was censured by the state House Wednesday after he said it has been argued that cases of fatal child abuse can be a “cost savings” because the child won't need related government services.The House voted 35-1 to censure Republican Rep.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818820,Federal agency proposes California spotted owl protection,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Federal wildlife officials on Wednesday announced a proposal to classify one of two dwindling California spotted owl populations as endangered after a lawsuit by conservation groups required the government to reassess a Trump administration decision not to protect the brown and white birds.

            The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed that California spotted owls that have their habitats in coastal and Southern California be protected under the Endangered Species Act. 

            That population “does not have a strong ability to withstand normal variations in environmental conditions, persist through catastrophic events, or adapt to new environmental conditions throughout its range,” which led the agency to propose listing it as endangered, wildlife officials said. 











            The other California spotted owl population, which lives in Sierra Nevada forests in California and western Nevada, would be classified as threatened, the agency said. 

            The habitat of the medium-sized brown owl with white spots on its head and chest and a barred tail is under serious threat from current logging practices and climate change, including increased drought, disease and more extreme wildfires. 

            Most California spotted owls live on land overseen by the Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. Forest Service.

            How much the population has declined since conservation groups started their effort to protect it more than 20 years ago is unclear. 

            The only available demographic data on spotted owls living in coastal and Southern California was collected in San Bernardino National Forest and shows a decline of 9%, the federal wildlife service said. 

            The Sierra Nevada population shows declines ranging from 50% to 31% percent in some areas, the agency said.

            The federal agency's decision follows an agreement reached in November between the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and several conservation groups that sued the federal agency in 2020 over its decision not to protect the California spotted owl population. 

            Justin Augustine, a senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, one of the groups that sued, applauded the agency’s decision and said he was happy to see the California spotted owls could finally get the safeguards they need. 

            Augustine said he planned to use the 60-day public comment period to push for more protections for the California spotted population in the Sierra Nevada. 

            ""One of the things I’ll be addressing is the issue of how to make sure that (Sierra Nevada) spotted owls are actually protected under their threatened status rather than potentially allowing some logging to occur that would be harmful,” he said. 

            The California spotted owl is one of three spotted owl subspecies and the last to be protected under the Endangered Species Act, Augustine said.

            The other two subspecies are the northern spotted owl and the Mexican spotted owl. 

            The northern spotted owl habitat is in Oregon, Washington state and Northern California. The tiny owl was listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act in 1990, sparking an intense battle over logging in the region. In 2020, the Trump Administration refused to upgrade it to endangered status despite losing nearly 4% of its population annually.

            The Mexican spotted owl was first listed as threatened in the U.S. in 1993. It is found in Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, Utah, parts of West Texas and Mexico.

            The species is in danger of extinction due to lose of habitat to logging, development, mining and wildfires.SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Federal wildlife officials on Wednesday announced a proposal to classify one of two dwindling California spotted owl populations as endangered after a lawsuit by conservation groups required the government to reassess a Trump administration decision not to protect the brown and white birds.The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed that California spotted owls that have their habitats in coastal and Southern California be protected under the Endangered Species Act.That population “does not have a strong ability to withstand normal variations in environmental conditions, persist through catastrophic events, or adapt to new environmental conditions throughout its range,” which led the agency to propose listing it as endangered, wildlife officials said.The other California spotted owl population, which lives in Sierra Nevada forests in California and western Nevada, would be classified as threatened, the agency said.The habitat of the medium-sized brown owl with white spots on its head and chest and a barred tail is under serious threat from current logging practices and climate change, including increased drought, disease and more extreme wildfires.Most California spotted owls live on land overseen by the Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. Forest Service.How much the population has declined since conservation groups started their effort to protect it more than 20 years ago is unclear.The only available demographic data on spotted owls living in coastal and Southern California was collected in San Bernardino National Forest and shows a decline of 9%, the federal wildlife service said.The Sierra Nevada population shows declines ranging from 50% to 31% percent in some areas, the agency said.The federal agency's decision follows an agreement reached in November between the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and several conservation groups that sued the federal agency in 2020 over its decision not to protect the California spotted owl population.Justin Augustine, a senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, one of the groups that sued, applauded the agency’s decision and said he was happy to see the California spotted owls could finally get the safeguards they need.Augustine said he planned to use the 60-day public comment period to push for more protections for the California spotted population in the Sierra Nevada.""One of the things I’ll be addressing is the issue of how to make sure that (Sierra Nevada) spotted owls are actually protected under their threatened status rather than potentially allowing some logging to occur that would be harmful,” he said.The California spotted owl is one of three spotted owl subspecies and the last to be protected under the Endangered Species Act, Augustine said.The other two subspecies are the northern spotted owl and the Mexican spotted owl.The northern spotted owl habitat is in Oregon, Washington state and Northern California.

It will also expand subsidies for public transport and promote tourism.On Wednesday (Feb. 22), Wang said in response to the opening of the border and the goal of having six million international visitors per year, the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) is discussing a program called the ""Accelerating the expansion of attracting international tourists plan"" and the necessary funds have been included in the NT$380 billion budget for the new post-pandemic stimulus bill, reported TVBS.Wang said the MOTC's three major strategies will be to promote travel by foreign tourists to Taiwan, accelerate the arrival of tourist groups, and stabilize the capacity of hotel services, to speed up tourism sector recovery. He said these strategies include NT$5,000 spending cash for foreign tourists and NT$10,000 to NT$20,000 in subsidies for each tour group travel agencies bring to Taiwan.In order to stabilize the capacity for hotel services, Wang said if employers increase the salary of new housekeeping and cleaning personnel to a certain level, MOTC will give each employer a monthly bonus of NT$5,000 per worker.",2023/2/23,19700,Travel & Cuisine

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818838,Westbrook signs with Clippers after clearing waivers,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — It didn't take long for Russell Westbrook to join the Los Angeles Clippers.

            The nine-time All-Star signed with the Clippers Wednesday after he cleared waivers, then hit the practice court as the team gathered for the first time since the All-Star break.

            “I’m super excited. I love to play basketball and I just have a lot of fun while doing it,” Westbrook said. “I get to stay home, see the wife and the kids and take them to school in the morning. That’s a big part of my day and you know, nothing more important than that.”











            Coach Tyronn Lue said Westbrook will play on Friday when the Clippers host the Sacramento Kings. When asked how he views what role Westbrook will play and if he would be a starter, Lue said, “I view him as what you will see on Friday.” 

            Westbrook is from the Los Angeles area, was a standout at UCLA and played less than two seasons for the Lakers before being traded to the Jazz on Feb. 10 as part of a three-team deal.

            The Jazz waived him on Monday. Westbrook cleared waivers because no team had the salary-cap space to take on the remaining $47 million he was owed on his expiring contract.

            The 15-year veteran is averaging 15.9 points, 6.2 rebounds and 7.1 assists in 28.7 minutes per game. He is one of only six players in the NBA this season averaging at least 15 points, six rebounds and seven assists.

            Lawrence Frank, the Clippers' director of basketball operations, said both sides are on the same page about how Westbrook can help the team.

            “We had an upfront and honest dialogue. I thought it was a really clean process, in that we talked through a lot of different possibilities to make sure that this could be a good relationship,” Frank said.

            Westbrook is reuniting with Paul George, his former teammate in Oklahoma City. George had lobbied the front office to add a point guard before the trade deadline. 

            George then stepped up the recruiting effort for Westbrook after he was traded to Utah and it appeared he could become a free agent.

            “I’ve been in this league a long time and being somewhere that people want you and they embrace you meant a lot to me,” Westbrook said.

            Westbrook brings something the Clippers lack — a fast, attacking guard who can get to the rim either to score or kick it out to the perimeter. Lue is hoping Westbrook can manufacture some easy baskets for George and Kawhi Leonard, a role the Clippers were hoping John Wall could play before he was traded to Houston.

            “I think that the most important part for me is just coming in, keeping the pace high, using my speed and the ability to be able to get into the paint and get those guys easy shots,” Westbrook said. “I’ll fit right in and continue doing what they have going on right now and everything else will play out itself.”

            Westbrook's signing completes a busy three-week period during which the Clippers made plenty of changes to their lineup. They reacquired Eric Gordon, who began his career with them in 2008, from Houston and got Bones Hyland from Denver. 

            They also acquired center Mason Plumlee from Charlotte for Reggie Jackson. LA also traded Luke Kennard to Memphis and Wall back to Houston.

            The Clippers are fourth in the Western Conference with a 33-28 record. They don't have much time to get all of their new pieces acclimated since they are in the middle of a playoff push.

            “The most important thing is winning the game. And so my job as a coach is to make sure we win the game and whoever is playing well that night will play,” Lue said. “We also got to focus on getting our rotations right. Making sure the right pieces are on the floor together and then kind of see how we’re going to play once the playoffs hit. So it’s a fine line, especially with 21 games left. So we got to speed this process up as best as we can.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818840,Sheriff IDs 3 climbers killed in Washington state avalanche,"SEATTLE (AP) — A sheriff’s office in Washington state on Wednesday released the identities of three climbers killed in an avalanche on a remote, jagged peak in the Cascade Mountains, saying they were members of a climbing club based in New York.

            The victims were Seong Cho, a 54-year-old male Korean citizen from West Hartford, Connecticut; Jeannie Lee, a 60-year-old woman from Bayside, New York; and Yun Park, a 66-year-old man from Palisades Park, New Jersey, the Chelan County Sheriff's Office said.

            They were killed Sunday as they ascended a steep, snow-packed gulley on the 8,705-foot (2,653-meter) Colchuck Peak, about 70 miles (115 kilometers) east of Seattle. A fourth member of their party was also caught up in the slide, but suffered only minor injuries and was able to verify that the three had died before additional avalanches covered at least two of the bodies.











            The avalanche was the the deadliest in the U.S. since four backcountry skiers were killed in an avalanche in Utah two years ago.

            Strong winds, heavy snow and high avalanche danger have prevented any attempt to retrieve the bodies. A pair of avalanche experts headed to the scene Wednesday to evaluate whether conditions might permit a recovery effort later this week, but they had not yet returned by Wednesday afternoon, said sheriff's Sgt. Jason Reinfeld.

            Reinfeld said Wednesday the group was part of a New York-based climbing club, but he had no further information about it.

            Six members of the group were ascending the gulley, called a couloir, early Sunday afternoon when the lead climber triggered the avalanche, the sheriff's office said. Four of the climbers were caught and swept about 500 feet (150 meters) down.

            A seventh member of the group, one who remained at base camp rather than participate in Sunday’s climb, hiked out to get help — an arduous overnight journey that included a descent of about 4,000 vertical feet (1,220 meters) over 8 miles (nearly 13 kilometers). He was able to contact the sheriff’s office by 8 a.m. Monday to relay what had happened, Reinfeld said.

            A mountain rescue team reached the base camp early that afternoon but decided against venturing above the lake due to the avalanche risk.

            Search teams declined to even attempt to reach the area on Tuesday amid a heavy snowstorm and wind gusts of up to 60 mph (96 kph).SEATTLE (AP) — A sheriff’s office in Washington state on Wednesday released the identities of three climbers killed in an avalanche on a remote, jagged peak in the Cascade Mountains, saying they were members of a climbing club based in New York.The victims were Seong Cho, a 54-year-old male Korean citizen from West Hartford, Connecticut; Jeannie Lee, a 60-year-old woman from Bayside, New York; and Yun Park, a 66-year-old man from Palisades Park, New Jersey, the Chelan County Sheriff's Office said.They were killed Sunday as they ascended a steep, snow-packed gulley on the 8,705-foot (2,653-meter) Colchuck Peak, about 70 miles (115 kilometers) east of Seattle.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818841,Eddie Jones looks to Super Rugby for Wallabies pointers,"WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — Super Rugby Pacific begins on Friday, carrying more importance in a World Cup year in which it will be part of the limited preparation of the national teams.

            The tournament may be more important still for returning Wallabies head coach Eddie Jones, whose relatively short lead-in to the World Cup kicking off in September means the Super Rugby season will be his first chance to accurately map the Australian rugby landscape.

            It is unlikely that Jones, while coaching England, was unaware of developments in rugby in his homeland. He's always been a keen observer. But this Super Rugby season will give him a much more thorough understanding of the talent pool at his disposal.











            First, under Jones there is unlikely to be any right of incumbency. Being a first choice under previous coach Dave Rennie won’t count in Jones’ new regime.

            The Wallabies have only five tests ahead of the World Cup and Jones will have to choose at least his initial squad on Super Rugby form.

            The ACT Brumbies coach Stephen Larkham, who was a star of the Wallabies team Jones coached to the 2003 World Cup final, believes that will enliven the selection race.

            “It’s going to be a challenge for the guys who probably thought they were secured of a spot for the World Cup,” Larkham said. “Eddie is one of those coaches that really looks at a player’s performance with a fine-tooth comb and he does a lot of background checking on his players.""

            One thing Jones has pledged not to do is impose demands on the coaches of Australia’s five Super Rugby clubs in terms of style. In New Zealand an orthodoxy of style exists among Super Rugby teams which feeds into the All Blacks. The lack of such a system in Australia may be a problem for the Wallabies coach, but Jones isn’t concerned.

            “We don’t tell the Super teams how to play,” he said. “We're not New Zealand or Ireland, we’re Australia. We have a relationship with the Super Rugby coaches but I want them to play the style they want to play.

            “What I want to see is that the players play with that toughness that they want to get better, they want to help their teammates in difficult situations.”

            Jones at least will be able to use matches between Australian teams and top New Zealand teams as a selection benchmark, particularly the defending champion Crusaders.

            “The games against the Crusaders or whoever the strongest New Zealand side is, they are the important selection games,” he said. “It’d be nice to have an Australian side win the Super Rugby final.”

            In New Zealand, All Blacks head coach Ian Foster probably already has a clear idea of how his 33-man squad will look. But it’s likely there might be “bolters” whose form will demand his consideration.

            Once again, New Zealand Rugby will impose restrictions on the workload of All Blacks during Super Rugby. Players who have played five consecutive games will have to take a week off, but Foster has indicated some flexibility.

            “It’s an individualized approach where we look at our players separately,” Foster said. “The overwhelming theme is to have them available for the vast majority of Super Rugby Pacific because that competition is vital for us. But also that we make sure that we do what we can to have a responsible management plan.”

            The Crusaders host the Chiefs in the tournament-opener at Christchurch, followed later Friday by the Waratahs at home in Sydney against the Brumbies. On Saturday, the Fijian Drua and Moana Pasifika meet at Mt. Smart Stadium in Auckland, followed by the Highlanders at home to the Blues in Dunedin, the Reds hosting the Wellington-based Hurricanes in Townsville, North Queensland, and the Perth-based Western Force against the Melbourne Rebels.

            The Drua also will be playing in front of a new national coach with World Cup places in mind. New Zealand-born Vern Cotter suddenly stepped down as Fiji coach last month and a replacement hasn’t yet been appointed.

            Drua head coach Mick Byrne said his players are better prepared than for their debut season last year after a much longer pre-season.

            “We’re in a lot better shape this year and we are really excited about what it means to us,” Byrne said. “We want to win as many games as possible and I think the playoffs are a realistic possibility.”

            Moana Pasifika also will approach its second Super Rugby Pacific season with confidence.

            “Essentially, we’ve got the same team coming back for our second year and although it’s the same team with the same people, it feels different.” head coach Aaron Mauger said. “We’re a year down the track, the players are a lot more mature and aware of the expectations and demands of not only the games but the training environment and how to prepare properly.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818843,"Mavs need wins in tight West as Doncic, Irving try to mesh","DALLAS (AP) — Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving are just two games into figuring out how to be co-stars for the Dallas Mavericks, who are behind schedule based on last season's surge that sparked a deep playoff run.

            The Mavericks have no choice but to win games while working out the kinks because of a tightly packed Western Conference.

            There's roughly a three-game difference between home-court advantage in the first round and missing the playoffs altogether, and second-year coach Jason Kidd accepts that reality a year after a strong second half that sent the Mavs on their way to the West finals.











            “This would be a good time to have that kick, but again, with Kai, we’re still getting to know each other,” Kidd said Wednesday as the club returned from the All-Star break with a practice a day before starting a six-game homestand against San Antonio. 

            With that, Kidd smiled and referred to the last time Doncic and Irving were on the court together with the Mavs, when they passed back and forth multiple times and didn't get a shot off in the final seconds of a 124-121 loss to Minnesota.

            “There’s going to be some times when you can see those two out there playing catch with one another,” Kidd said. “Hopefully that’s over. One of them will shoot the ball, I guarantee.”

            Irving missed the last game before the break with back tightness, and solo Doncic wasn't enough in a 118-109 loss at Denver when Dallas trailed by as many as 21 points.

            Doncic was out for Irving debut's because of a heel injury that sidelined him for four games. The pair is 0-2 together, but barring injury, Dallas can expect Doncic and Irving to be together on the court in most, if not all, of its 22 remaining games.

            Center Dwight Powell is one of the starters tasked with helping the new pairing work.

            “At the end of the day, I've just got to be ready for the opportunities they're creating because they gravity of those two is insane,” Powell said. “Having them out there at the same time, I really got to be ready for a multitude of situations, and their creativity means I have to be making decisions on the fly.

            “It’s a lot of film. It’s getting used to guys in practice. But it’s one of those things that comes with time. Looking forward to how we all kind of grow together over these next few games.”

            A year ago, the Mavs started their surge around the new year, finishing fourth in the West and beating Utah twice without an injured Doncic in a six-game series win in the first round.

            After blowing out Phoenix on the road in Game 7 of the West semifinals, Dallas lost to Golden State in five before the Warriors won the title.

            The roster wasn't quite the same this season after Jalen Brunson, a huge part of the first-round win over Utah, left for New York in free agency. A similar surge hasn't happened.

            There's plenty of time for the Mavs to get back to where they finished in the standings last season, maybe even higher, if their All-Star tandem can reach its potential.

            “It’s beautiful to watch someone so creative play the game the way he does,” Powell said, referring to Irving but aware he's been watching something similar from Doncic for five seasons. “To have two guys that are at that level of mastery is exciting for us around them and gives us a crazy amount of firepower. It's on us to remain ready.”

            Irving had 32 points, a game-high 15 assists and played a Team LeBron-high 29 minutes in a 184-175 All-Star Game loss to Team Giannis. Doncic, a fellow Team LeBron starter, played 19 minutes and scored four points.

            Now the numbers will be more similar — both scored in the 20s in their debut together and in the 30s against the Timberwolves. And both will be pushing 40 minutes per game, another issue for Kidd to sort out.

            The soon-to-be 24-year-old Doncic probably won't play every minute after halftime, which he has done several times while remaining neck-and-neck with Philadelphia's Joel Embiid in the scoring race.

            “For Kai, I think it's just a matter of the time spent on and off the floor with the guys,” Kidd said. “With the break, everybody kind of goes their separate way. We've got 22 games left. Now it's just about connecting not only on the floor but off the floor. He's an adult. He knows how to do that.”

            AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsDALLAS (AP) — Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving are just two games into figuring out how to be co-stars for the Dallas Mavericks, who are behind schedule based on last season's surge that sparked a deep playoff run.The Mavericks have no choice but to win games while working out the kinks because of a tightly packed Western Conference.There's roughly a three-game difference between home-court advantage in the first round and missing the playoffs altogether, and second-year coach Jason Kidd accepts that reality a year after a strong second half that sent the Mavs on their way to the West finals.“This would be a good time to have that kick, but again, with Kai, we’re still getting to know each other,” Kidd said Wednesday as the club returned from the All-Star break with a practice a day before starting a six-game homestand against San Antonio.With that, Kidd smiled and referred to the last time Doncic and Irving were on the court together with the Mavs, when they passed back and forth multiple times and didn't get a shot off in the final seconds of a 124-121 loss to Minnesota.“There’s going to be some times when you can see those two out there playing catch with one another,” Kidd said. “Hopefully that’s over.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818855,Saint Lucia ambassador reaffirms Taiwan ties on independence day,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Saint Lucia Ambassador Robert Kennedy Lewis pledged to continue to deepen friendship with the government and people of Taiwan during a celebration marking 44 years of Saint Lucian independence on Wednesday (Feb. 23).

            Kennedy said Taiwan has become one of Saint Lucia’s biggest benefactors in the last 20 years. Taiwan has been “a trusted and reliable ally,” he said, pointing to joint programs in agriculture, education, health, sports, business and commerce, youth unemployment, and entrepreneurship.

            He quoted Saint Lucian diplomat Nancy Nicholas as saying that “Taiwan's strong and principled diplomacy can always be depended on to help us paddle our ships of state out of the murky waters of complex threats to our socio-economic security.”

            Kennedy said bilateral ties are based on “mutual respect, collaboration, and cooperation.” The two nations are known for their friendly peoples and embrace the rule of law, democratic traditions, individual liberties, and a sense of fairness, he said.











            Taiwan is always eager to share its knowledge and experience with the rest of the world, the ambassador said. “Saint Lucia will continue to clamor and agitate at every international gathering and forum for the inclusion of Taiwan in the decision-making of our planet,” he said.

            Kennedy vowed that his country will continue to respect Taiwan’s right to sovereignty and the right of Taiwanese to choose their leaders and how they are governed.

            He praised Sir George Charles, founder of the Saint Lucia Labour Party and former Chief Minister of Saint Lucia, and Sir John Compton, the first prime minister of Saint Lucia, as “national heroes” who “set the nation on a journey from colonization to independence.”

            Despite the hardships brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, Saint Lucians came out “stronger and more resilient,” Kennedy said. He describes his fellow nationals as “daring people” who “have learned to be determined in our fight for the values we cherish and for the things we hope for.”

            “We are not daunted by any challenge presented to us,” he said.

            Saint Lucia gained its independence from the U.K. on Feb. 22, 1979. This year’s theme is “Douvan Ansanm; One People. Shaping our destiny.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818874,ChatGPT launches boom in AI-written e-books on Amazon,"Until recently, Brett Schickler never imagined he could be a published author, though he had dreamed about it. But after learning about the ChatGPT artificial intelligence program, Schickler figured an opportunity had landed in his lap.""The idea of writing a book finally seemed possible,"" said Schickler, a salesman in Rochester, New York. ""I thought 'I can do this.'""Using the AI software, which can generate blocks of text from simple prompts, Schickler created a 30-page illustrated children’s e-book in a matter of hours, offering it for sale in January through Amazon.com Inc's AMZN.O self-publishing unit.In the edition, Sammy the Squirrel, crudely rendered also using AI, learns from his forest friends about saving money after happening upon a gold coin. He crafts an acorn-shaped piggy bank, invests in an acorn trading business and hopes to one day buy an acorn grinding stone.Sammy becomes the wealthiest squirrel in the forest, the envy of his friends and ""the forest started prospering,"" according to the book.""The Wise Little Squirrel: A Tale of Saving and Investing,"" available in the Amazon Kindle store for $2.99 - or $9.99 for a printed version - has netted Schickler less than $100, he said. While that may not sound like much, it is enough to inspire him to compose other books using the software.""I could see people making a whole career out of this,"" said Schickler, who used prompts on ChatGPT like ""write a story about a dad teaching his son about financial literacy.""Schickler is on the leading edge of a movement testing the promise and limitations of ChatGPT, which debuted in November and has sent shock waves through Silicon Valley and beyond for its uncanny ability to create cogent blocks of text instantly.There were over 200 e-books in Amazon’s Kindle store as of mid-February listing ChatGPT as an author or co-author, including ""How to Write and Create Content Using ChatGPT,"" ""The Power of Homework"" and poetry collection ""Echoes of the Universe."" And the number is rising daily. There is even a new sub-genre on Amazon: Books about using ChatGPT, written entirely by ChatGPT.But due to the nature of ChatGPT and many authors' failure to disclose they have used it, it is nearly impossible to get a full accounting of how many e-books may be written by AI.The software's emergence has already ruffled some of the biggest technology firms, prompting Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O and Microsoft Corp MSFT.O to hastily debut new functions in Google and Bing, respectively, that incorporate AI.The rapid consumer adoption of ChatGPT has spurred frenzied activity in tech circles as investors pour money into AI-focused startups and given technology firms new purpose amid the gloom of massive layoffs. Microsoft, for one, received fawning coverage this month over its otherwise moribund Bing search engine after demonstrating an integration with ChatGPT.But already there are concerns over authenticity, because ChatGPT learns how to write by scanning millions of pages of existing text. An experiment with AI by CNET resulted in multiple corrections and apparent plagiarism before the tech news site suspended its use.THREAT TO 'REAL' AUTHORS?Now ChatGPT appears ready to upend the staid book industry as would-be novelists and self-help gurus looking to make a quick buck are turning to the software to help create bot-made e-books and publish them through Amazon’s Kindle Direct Publishing arm. Illustrated children’s books are a favorite for such first-time authors. On YouTube, TikTok and Reddit hundreds of tutorials have spring up, demonstrating how to make a book in just a few hours. Subjects include get-rich-quick schemes, dieting advice, software coding tips and recipes.“This is something we really need to be worried about, these books will flood the market and a lot of authors are going to be out of work,” said Mary Rasenberger, executive director of writers’ group the Authors Guild. Ghostwriting - by humans - has a long tradition, she said, but the ability to automate through AI could turn book writing from a craft into a commodity.“There needs to be transparency from the authors and the platforms about how these books are created or you’re going to end up with a lot of low-quality books,” she said.One author, who goes by Frank White, showed in a YouTube video how in less than a day he created a 119-page novella called “Galactic Pimp: Vol. 1” about alien factions in a far-off galaxy warring over a human-staffed brothel. The book can be had for just $1 on Amazon’s Kindle e-book store. In the video, White says anyone with the wherewithal and time could create 300 such books a year, all using AI.Many authors, like White, feel no duty to disclose in the Kindle store that their great American novel was written wholesale by a computer, in part because Amazon’s policies do not require it.When asked for comment by Reuters, Amazon did not address whether it had plans to change or review its Kindle store policies around authors’ use of AI or other automated writing tools. “All books in the store must adhere to our content guidelines, including by complying with intellectual property rights and all other applicable laws,” Amazon spokeswoman Lindsay Hamilton said via email.A spokeswoman for ChatGPT developer OpenAI declined to comment.FROM CONCEPTION TO PUBLICATION IN JUST HOURSAmazon is by far the largest seller of both physical and e-books, commanding well over half of sales in the United States and, by some estimates, over 80% of the e-book market. Its Kindle Direct Publishing service has spawned a cottage industry of self-published novelists, carving out particular niches for enthusiasts of erotic content and self-help books.Amazon created Kindle Direct Publishing in 2007 to allow anyone to sell and market a book from their couch without the hassle or expense of seeking out literary agents or publishing houses. Generally, Amazon allows authors to publish instantly through the unit without any oversight, splitting whatever proceeds they generate.That has attracted new AI-assisted authors like Kamil Banc, whose primary job is selling fragrances online, who bet his wife he could make a book from conception to publication in less than one day. Using ChatGPT, an AI image creator and prompts like ""write a bedtime story about a pink dolphin that teaches children how to be honest,"" Banc published an illustrated 27-page book in December. Available on Amazon, ""Bedtime Stories: Short and Sweet, For a Good Night’s Sleep"" took Banc about four hours to create, he said.Consumer interest so far has been admittedly sleepy: Banc said sales have totaled about a dozen copies. But readers rated it worthy of five stars, including one who praised its ""wonderful and memorable characters.""Banc has since published two more AI-generated books, including an adult coloring book, with more in the works. ""It actually is really simple,"" he said. ""I was surprised at how fast it went from concept to publishing.""Not everyone is blown away by the software. Mark Dawson, who has reportedly sold millions of copies of books he wrote himself through Kindle Direct Publishing, was quick to call ChatGPT-assisted novels ""dull"" in an email to Reuters.""Merit plays a part in how books are recommended to other readers. If a book gets bad reviews because the writing is dull then it’s quickly going to sink to the bottom.""",2023/2/23,538,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818876,South Carolina Senate OKs 'shield law' for lethal injections,"COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — The South Carolina Senate passed on Wednesday a law shielding the identity of pharmaceutical companies providing lethal injection drugs for state executions.

            The move marks lawmakers' latest effort to resume capital punishment in a state that has gone nearly 12 years without administering the death penalty.

            South Carolina has been unable to purchase the drugs necessary for lethal injection since the state's batch expired in 2013. Officials have largely blamed the inability to replenish the supply on the lack of a so-called “shield law."" Republican leaders have said pharmaceutical companies fear public pressure from activists and therefore will not sell to states that do not conceal their identities.











            With Wednesday’s 39-5 bipartisan vote, Republican Sen. Greg Hembree hopes that will soon change.

            “If you believe that the condemned should have the option of choosing lethal injection as a method of execution, you should support this bill,” said Hembree, a former prosecutor and lead sponsor of the measure.

            Republican Gov. Henry McMaster signed a 2021 law forcing people on death row to choose between the electric chair or a newly formed firing squad in hopes the state could restart its executions after the involuntary pause.

            The law has been put on hold amid a legal challenge from four condemned prisoners. In the latest development for that case, the Supreme Court of South Carolina ordered the South Carolina Department of Corrections to provide more information regarding its attempts to acquire lethal injection drugs.

            Throughout Wednesday's debate, lawmakers’ interest in accountability ran up against their interest in resuming the death penalty. The bill bars courts from compelling any information identifying members of the execution team during discovery, subpoena or other legal processes.

            Democrats expressing concern about botched executions offered amendments that would have allowed courts to order identifying information “upon a showing of good cause.”

            “There’s got to be some window to where if something goes wrong, somebody will have to answer for it to somebody,” Democratic Sen. Thomas McElveen said.

            Hembree expressed openness to finding a middle ground. But he said the inclusion of exceptions for “good cause” has prevented other states from obtaining lethal injection drugs even after enacting similar laws.

            “If we adopt this amendment, we need to not adopt the bill,"" Hembree said. ""Because it will not lead to the availability of the drugs necessary to carry out the executions.”

            Under the proposal, the South Carolina Department of Corrections is required to share autopsy results with the attorney for anyone killed by lethal injection. Any drugs must be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and pharmacists can supply and manufacture lethal injection drugs without a physician’s prescription.

            The measure would require the qualifications of any medical professionals involved in the execution to be published. It also requires that medical personnel be fully licensed and certified without any documented professional misconduct. 

            Rev. Hillary Taylor said she was disappointed in the bill's lack of oversight. Taylor, the executive director of South Carolinians for Alternatives to the Death Penalty, rejected any notions that lethal injection provides a “kinder” option for people on death row.

            “If South Carolina really cared about humanitarian efforts, they would be using all of this money and effort that they are trying to kill only 37 people in South Carolina — they would use those funds to help victims actually heal and invest in alternatives to the death penalty,” Taylor said.

Greg Hembree hopes that will soon change.“If you believe that the condemned should have the option of choosing lethal injection as a method of execution, you should support this bill,” said Hembree, a former prosecutor and lead sponsor of the measure.Republican Gov. Henry McMaster signed a 2021 law forcing people on death row to choose between the electric chair or a newly formed firing squad in hopes the state could restart its executions after the involuntary pause.The law has been put on hold amid a legal challenge from four condemned prisoners. In the latest development for that case, the Supreme Court of South Carolina ordered the South Carolina Department of Corrections to provide more information regarding its attempts to acquire lethal injection drugs.Throughout Wednesday's debate, lawmakers’ interest in accountability ran up against their interest in resuming the death penalty. The bill bars courts from compelling any information identifying members of the execution team during discovery, subpoena or other legal processes.Democrats expressing concern about botched executions offered amendments that would have allowed courts to order identifying information “upon a showing of good cause.”“There’s got to be some window to where if something goes wrong, somebody will have to answer for it to somebody,” Democratic Sen. Thomas McElveen said.Hembree expressed openness to finding a middle ground. But he said the inclusion of exceptions for “good cause” has prevented other states from obtaining lethal injection drugs even after enacting similar laws.“If we adopt this amendment, we need to not adopt the bill,"" Hembree said. ""Because it will not lead to the availability of the drugs necessary to carry out the executions.”Under the proposal, the South Carolina Department of Corrections is required to share autopsy results with the attorney for anyone killed by lethal injection. Any drugs must be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and pharmacists can supply and manufacture lethal injection drugs without a physician’s prescription.The measure would require the qualifications of any medical professionals involved in the execution to be published. It also requires that medical personnel be fully licensed and certified without any documented professional misconduct.Rev. Hillary Taylor said she was disappointed in the bill's lack of oversight. Taylor, the executive director of South Carolinians for Alternatives to the Death Penalty, rejected any notions that lethal injection provides a “kinder” option for people on death row.“If South Carolina really cared about humanitarian efforts, they would be using all of this money and effort that they are trying to kill only 37 people in South Carolina — they would use those funds to help victims actually heal and invest in alternatives to the death penalty,” Taylor said.—-James Pollard is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818878,No. 18 UConn uses big second half to down No. 20 Providence,"STORRS, Conn. (AP) — With a rowdy crowd behind them on $2 beer night, No. 18 UConn used a big second half to beat No. 20 Providence on Wednesday night. 

            Jordan Hawkins scored 20 points to lead Connecticut to the 87-69 win and a split of the regular-season series between the New England rivals. 

            Adama Sanogo and Alex Karaban each added 16 points for the Huskies (21-7, 10-7 Big East), who won for the fifth time in their last six games. 











            Tristen Newton had 12 points, seven rebounds and seven assists. 

            It was the third time this month the Huskies have avenged a road loss in the Big East with a home win, something Hawkins referred to as his team’s “revenge tour.”

            “Things can start to unravel kind of quickly if you’re going into these top-5 teams on the road,” UConn coach Dan Hurley said. “It’s hard to win a game. And it would have been hard for anyone to come in with this type of crowd today.""

            Bryce Hopkins scored 16 points and Jared Bynum had 14 for the Friars (20-8, 12-5), who fell two games behind Marquette in the race for the Big East's regular-season title. 

            UConn led by just five at halftime, but outscored Providence 50-37 in the second half. 

            “The fans were unbelievable,” Karaban said. “They really lifted us up when Providence came storming back in the second half. So, they really gave us momentum to go on that run. Two-dollar beer night was a good one I guess.”

            UConn scored the final five points of the first half and Hawkins had the first five points of the second to turn a tie game into a 10-point lead at 42-32.

            Providence responded a short time later with a 7-0 run to cut the lead to two points.

            But the Huskies held the Friars without a basket for more than five minutes and built the lead to 17 with a 14-0 run and extended that to as many as 22 points.

            The Huskies dominated the paint, outscoring the Friars 42-24 down low and outrebounding Providence 40-20.

            “It was men against boys in the second half,” Providence coach Ed Cooley said. “I thought their physicality and the environment here was big time.”

            This was the first time in the 77-game history of the rivalry that both teams were ranked when they faced each other. 

            UConn is now 46-31 all-time against Friars, but had lost three of the previous four meetings, including a 73-61 setback in Rhode Island on Jan. 4.

            BIG PICTURE

            Providence: The Friars, trying to repeat as regular-season conference champions, dropped into a tie with Xavier and Creighton for second place in the conference standings.

            UConn: The Huskies extended their lead to a game over Seton Hall for fifth place in the league. The top five teams in the conference standings will earn a bye in the first round of the conference tournament. 

            KARABAN'S CHIP

            Karaban heard a lot of criticism about his defense after Hopkins scored 27 points in the Friars 12-point win in January. He held the Providence star to 4 of 10 shooting in this one.

            “The first game, I felt like he embarrassed me,"" Karaban said. “I took full responsibility for that loss, because I wasn't able to contain him as well as I should have.”

            FINDING THE WHISTLE

            The referees called just five fouls in the first half and neither team shot a free throw before intermission. There were 13 fouls called on Providence in the second half and eight on the Huskies. UConn made 13 of 14 shots from the foul line and Providence was 17 of 20. Providence was 29 of 35 from the line in the teams’ first meeting.

(AP) — Brandon Miller scored a career-high 41 points, including the go-ahead basket with 0.9 seconds left in overtime, as No. 2 Alabama outlasted South Carolina 78-76 on Wednesday night. 

            Miller’s performance came a day after the 6-foot-9 freshman standout was linked to a fatal shooting near campus last month. However, hours before tipoff, Alabama said Miller was “not a suspect” and would remain an “active member” for the Crimson Tide (24-4, 14-1 Southeastern Conference). 

            Miller shook off some early struggles to lead Alabama, which kept its one-game lead over No. 25 Texas A&M in the race for the SEC regular-season championship. 











            Miller’s final basket in regulation, with 4.1 seconds to play, tied the game at 68 and forced the extra period. Miller finished 14 of 25 from the field and had six of Alabama’s seven 3-pointers.

            Gregory “GG” Jackson led South Carolina (10-17, 3-11) with 19 points. Meechie Johnson and Jacobi Wright had 18 apiece.

            BOSTON (AP) — Makai Ashton-Langford scored 16 points, Jaeden Zackery had all 12 of his points in the second half and Boston College held Virginia to a season-low 32% from the field.

            The Eagles have beaten three ranked teams this season. With BC (14-15, 8-10 Atlantic Coast Conference) only adding to its lead in the final minutes, the raucous Conte Forum crowd gathered along the perimeter of the court, ready to rush it at the buzzer. 

            Jayden Gardner scored 16 points for Virginia (21-5, 13-4), which fell into a second-place tie with Pittsburgh in the ACC standings, one-half game behind Miami. The Cavaliers, who had been as high as No. 2 in the AP Top 25, had won four in a row and 11 of their previous 12 games.

            HOUSTON (AP) — J’Wan Roberts had a career-high 26 points and seven rebounds, Marcus Sasser scored 22 points and Houston beat Tulane.

            Houston secured at least a share of the American Athletic Conference regular-season championship. The Cougars (26-2, 14-1) have won eight straight games and the league title is their fourth in five seasons.

            Jarace Walker had a career-high 13 rebounds for Houston.

            Jalen Cook scored 23 points, his seventh straight game with at least 20 points for Tulane (17-8, 10-4), which saw its five-game winning streak snapped. Jaylen Forbes added 14 points.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818882,"No. 6 Virginia goes cold, Boston College wins 63-48","BOSTON (AP) — With Boston College clutching a double-digit lead over No. 6 Virginia late in the second half, the Conte Forum security staff huddled in a tunnel just off the court to prepare for the onslaught of fans that was all but inevitable.

            The crowd knew. The Virginia players knew. Everyone in the building knew the Eagles were on the verge of the biggest win of coach Earl Grant's tenure. 

            “I think they sensed, ‘Boy, I think we’re going to get these guys,’” Virginia coach Tony Bennett said after BC beat the cold-shooting Cavaliers 63-48 on Wednesday night to send the sellout crowd streaming onto the court in celebration.











            “As this thing wore on, you could feel the crowd get into it,” said Bennett, whose team shot a season-low 32% from the field against the BC defense. “They put us on our heels. It was a lot for some of our guys. We’ve got to learn from that, because of what we’ve got coming up.” 

            Makai Ashton-Langford scored 16 points and Jaeden Zackery had all 12 of his points in the second half for BC (14-15, 8-10 Atlantic Coast Conference). It was the Eagles' third win over a ranked team this season, but the first over one in the top 10 since beating top-ranked Duke in 2017.

            “I think we’re moving in the right direction,” said Grant, who is in his second year since moving to Chestnut Hill from the College of Charleston. “I thought the night was a great test. We were excited about the challenge; we were excited going into it. We knew it would be hard, but we wanted to see what we were.”

            Jayden Gardner scored 16 points for Virginia (21-5, 13-4), which fell into a second-place tie with Pittsburgh in the ACC, one-half game behind Miami. The Cavaliers, who had been as high as No. 2 in the AP Top 25, had won four in a row and 11 of their previous 12 games.

            Armaan Franklin, the Cavaliers’ leading scorer, and fellow guard Reece Beekman combined to go 4 of 18 from the field and miss all six of their 3-point tries. Virginia finished 4 of 21 (19%) from beyond the arc.

            The Cavaliers also shot 67% from the free-throw line, including back-to-back misses by Ryan Dunn that earned all 7,000 in attendance a free order of cheesy bacon fries. 

            That was all the encouragement the crowd needed. 

            And the players fed off it, too.

            “The program is going up,” Zackery said. “Coming in against ranked teams, we feel like that motivates us more because, honestly, at that point, we don’t have anything to lose. They're the ones that are ranked. We just come in, play our best.”

            Virginia led early before BC took the lead for good midway through the first half, using an 11-2 run to open a 26-17 advantage. The Eagles made it a 13-point game early in the second.

            Gardner hit back-to-back baskets midway through the second to make it 44-37, but Isaac McKneely missed a 3-pointer that could have made it a four-point game. Zackery responded by driving the lane, bouncing off a defender and rolling it in off the rim before giving a double-armed flex in celebration. 

            Then, after Kihei Clark missed a layup, Zackery hit a 3-pointer to give BC a 49-37 lead, earning a congratulatory shoulder-squeeze from big man Quinten Post. Bennett called timeout, but the Cavaliers never again got within single digits.

            BIG PICTURE

            Virginia had beaten Boston College four times in a row and needed only to keep moving up to earn a No. 1 seed in the NCAA tournament. The setback against a sub-.500 team will be damaging. 

            Boston College had already beaten Virginia Tech and Clemson this season when they were ranked. The Eagles haven’t beaten three ranked teams in a season since 2008-09.

Everyone in the building knew the Eagles were on the verge of the biggest win of coach Earl Grant's tenure.“I think they sensed, ‘Boy, I think we’re going to get these guys,’” Virginia coach Tony Bennett said after BC beat the cold-shooting Cavaliers 63-48 on Wednesday night to send the sellout crowd streaming onto the court in celebration.“As this thing wore on, you could feel the crowd get into it,” said Bennett, whose team shot a season-low 32% from the field against the BC defense. “They put us on our heels. It was a lot for some of our guys. We’ve got to learn from that, because of what we’ve got coming up.”Makai Ashton-Langford scored 16 points and Jaeden Zackery had all 12 of his points in the second half for BC (14-15, 8-10 Atlantic Coast Conference). It was the Eagles' third win over a ranked team this season, but the first over one in the top 10 since beating top-ranked Duke in 2017.“I think we’re moving in the right direction,” said Grant, who is in his second year since moving to Chestnut Hill from the College of Charleston. “I thought the night was a great test. We were excited about the challenge; we were excited going into it. We knew it would be hard, but we wanted to see what we were.”Jayden Gardner scored 16 points for Virginia (21-5, 13-4), which fell into a second-place tie with Pittsburgh in the ACC, one-half game behind Miami. The Cavaliers, who had been as high as No. 2 in the AP Top 25, had won four in a row and 11 of their previous 12 games.Armaan Franklin, the Cavaliers’ leading scorer, and fellow guard Reece Beekman combined to go 4 of 18 from the field and miss all six of their 3-point tries. Virginia finished 4 of 21 (19%) from beyond the arc.The Cavaliers also shot 67% from the free-throw line, including back-to-back misses by Ryan Dunn that earned all 7,000 in attendance a free order of cheesy bacon fries.That was all the encouragement the crowd needed.And the players fed off it, too.“The program is going up,” Zackery said. “Coming in against ranked teams, we feel like that motivates us more because, honestly, at that point, we don’t have anything to lose. They're the ones that are ranked. We just come in, play our best.”Virginia led early before BC took the lead for good midway through the first half, using an 11-2 run to open a 26-17 advantage. The Eagles made it a 13-point game early in the second.Gardner hit back-to-back baskets midway through the second to make it 44-37, but Isaac McKneely missed a 3-pointer that could have made it a four-point game. Zackery responded by driving the lane, bouncing off a defender and rolling it in off the rim before giving a double-armed flex in celebration.Then, after Kihei Clark missed a layup, Zackery hit a 3-pointer to give BC a 49-37 lead, earning a congratulatory shoulder-squeeze from big man Quinten Post. Bennett called timeout, but the Cavaliers never again got within single digits.BIG PICTUREVirginia had beaten Boston College four times in a row and needed only to keep moving up to earn a No. 1 seed in the NCAA tournament. The setback against a sub-.500 team will be damaging.Boston College had already beaten Virginia Tech and Clemson this season when they were ranked.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818883,Australian pleads guilty to killing gay American in 1988,"CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — An Australian pleaded guilty on Thursday to manslaughter in the death 35 years ago of an American who fell from a Sydney clifftop that was known as a gay meeting place, with the victim’s family welcoming the turning point in their long campaign for justice.

            Scott White’s admission in the New South Wales state Supreme Court came three months after he had his conviction on charges of murdering Scott Johnson overturned by an appeals court.

            The family of Los Angeles-born Johnson had fought for years to overturn an initial finding that the 27-year-old mathematician had taken his own life in 1988.











            Johnson’s Boston-based older brother, Steve Johnson, told reporters that the proceedings Thursday “might be the most emotional moment yet.” He watched the Sydney court hearing online from the United States.

            Breakthrough evidence came last October when police intercepted a prison phone call between White and a niece in which he confessed to striking his victim at the clifftop, Johnson said.

            “In that phone call to the niece, he corroborated evidence that they (police) had previously gathered, and that brought his defense team to the table” to negotiate a guilty plea, Johnson told The Associated Press.

            “The police work that continued during the appeal and after the appeal to get that one last piece of evidence that brought him to the table ... so that we could negotiate this, I’m incredibly thankful,” he said.

            Johnson said he has read the facts of the crime agreed between prosecutors and defense lawyers as part of a plea deal that will be presented to a judge when White returns to court on June 6 to be sentenced.

            “Reading the black and white of his confession, in which he states that he threw the first punch, which I imagine was the only punch and my brother must have been very close to the cliff ... makes me pretty angry,” Johnson said.

            A coroner ruled in 2017 that Scott Johnson “fell from the clifftop as a result of actual or threatened violence” by unknown assailants who “attacked him because they perceived him to be homosexual.”

            The coroner also found that gangs of men roamed various Sydney locations in search of gay men to assault, resulting in the deaths of some victims. Some people were also robbed.

            It was the third inquest into the tragedy following pressure from the family. A coroner had initially ruled in 1989 that the openly gay man had taken his own life, while a second coroner in 2012 could not explain how he died.

            Steve Johnson described the police investigation since the third inquest as “spectacular.” But he said his brother’s homicide could have been solved easily by police when he died.

            “In fact, many of us believe that it was the police indifference to these killings and bashings of gay men back in the ’80s that helped cause them. The perpetrators always knew they would not get into trouble,” Johnson said.

            A New South Wales government inquiry began hearing evidence in November of unsolved deaths resulting from gay hate crimes over four decades in Australia’s most populous state, where police were notoriously indifferent to such violence.

            Violence against gay men in Sydney was particularly prevalent from the mid-1980s until the early 1990s due to increased hostility and fear stemming from the AIDS epidemic, an HIV support group, ACON, told the inquiry.

            Steve Johnson, a wealthy entrepreneur, offered a 1 million Australian dollar ($704,000) reward in 2020 for information about his brother's death, matching a reward already offered by police.

            White, 52, was arrested in Sydney that year and pleaded not guilty to the murder of Johnson, who was an Australian National University Ph.D. student living in the capital, Canberra, when he died.

            Police have suggested the reward led to the arrest, saying they expected it would be collected after White’s conviction.

            White took his lawyers by surprise in January last year by pleading guilty to murder during a pretrial hearing.

            About 20 minutes later, White signed a statement saying that he had been “confused” when he pleaded guilty, had not caused Johnson’s death and wanted to plead not guilty.

            But the judge recorded the guilty plea and White was sentenced to 12 years and seven months in prison.

            In sentencing White, the judge said she did not find beyond reasonable doubt that the murder was a gay hate crime, which would have led to a longer prison term.

            In November, three judges of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal ruled that White should have been allowed to reverse his guilty plea, quashing his conviction and sentence.

            White on Thursday pleaded not guilty to murder and guilty to manslaughter. Prosecutors had earlier agreed with White’s lawyers to accept the plea.

            Police Deputy Chief Inspector Peter Yeomans told reporters outside the court that the conviction vindicated the Johnson family’s long fight for justice.

            “Look, a very emotional day for everyone, especially the Johnson family, who’ve been through a very traumatic time over the past 34 years and today really vindicates that family, what they’ve done over many, many years,” Yeomans said.

            Toppin closed a 15-4 run with a 3-pointer and fast-break dunk to give Kentucky a 74-63 lead with 3:43 left. But Florida scored the next nine points, including six free throws — the last by Kyle Lofton with 1:12 left. 

            Chris Livingston ended Kentucky's nearly three-minute scoring drought on a three-point play with 49.1 seconds left. Florida missed a shot in the lane and Toppin sealed it with two free throws.











            Antonio Reeves added 16 points and Livingston had 10 points and 15 rebounds for Kentucky (19-9, 10-5 SEC). Tshiebwe, who was 12 of 13 from the field, banked in a jumper in the first half to reach 1,000 career points — the 61st in program history to do so.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818923,US women win SheBelieves Cup with 2-1 victory over Brazil,"FRISCO, Texas (AP) — Alex Morgan and Mallory Swanson scored and the United States defeated Brazil 2-1 on Wednesday night to win the SheBelieves Cup for the fourth straight year. 

            Japan, which defeated Canada 3-0 in the earlier match at Toyota Stadium, was runner-up in the four-team, round-robin tournament. All four SheBelieves Cup teams will play in Women’s World Cup this summer in Australia and New Zealand. 

            Morgan's curling goal sailed out of reach of Brazilian goalkeeper Lorena. Morgan now has five goals all-time in SheBelieves matches. 











            It was Morgan's 14th goal since the birth of her daughter in 2020, giving her the national team record for most goals as a mom. 

            “That was huge,” Swanson said. “I think we needed it, we needed the momentum to kind of shift in our favor. (It was) Alex doing Alex things. Simple, left foot, classic. She was getting beat up all first half and ultimately she punished them.""

            Swanson scored in the 63rd minute, her fourth goal of the tournament and seventh overall goal this year, matching her total of all of last year. 

            “I think honestly it's been a good run. I've really just tried to focus on being present and just taking it day by day, game by game,” Swanson said. 

            Swanson, formerly Mallory Pugh, married Chicago Cubs shortstop Dansby Swanson in December. 

            Ludmila scored in stoppage time for Brazil to avoid the shutout. It was the first goal the United States has allowed this year. The United States is undefeated in five overall matches. 

            “We need to be on the same page. But not only when it comes to reading the game, but also the emotional game, we need to be on the same page. If we can do that, I think we’ll have a great World Cup. If we can’t, it will be very difficult. So that’s why I’m saying we have a long way to go,"" Brazil coach Pia Sundhage said. 

            Midfielder Rose Lavelle started for the United States after missing the first two matches of the tournament with a minor injury. 

            Japan snapped a four-game losing streak with its win over Canada. Japan had not scored in four straight matches, including two SheBelieves games, until Kiko Seike put her team in front with a goal in the 26th minute.

            The Canadian players, in the midst of a labor dispute with their federation, again wore purple T-shirts reading “Enough is Enough” for the anthems and they wore purple wristbands during the match. 

            Players for the United States also wore purple wristbands in solidarity with Canada. 

            The SheBelieves Cup started in 2016. The United States has won six of the eight tournaments. 

            “I don’t think we’re going to talk a lot about the title. We’re actually going to talk a lot about the play and the details, and we’re going to use these games to prepare for the World Cup,"" U.S. coach Vlatko Andonovski said. “So that’s what is good about this, it’s not necessarily the title -- obviously we enjoy winning, we enjoy winning the title -- but it’s the outcome of these game is what is more important for us.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818926,"Taiwan's TSMC Arizona venture: Costs, labor relations worry analysts, employees","TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Cost issues, personnel management, and cultural differences have some at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) worried, as their company steams ahead with US$40 billion (NT$1.21 trillion) in investment for its upcoming Arizona chip plants.According to 11 TSMC employees who spoke with the New York Times, the U.S. investment could become a distraction for the company, which has so far relied on a relentless focus on research and development to stay ahead of the market. The New York Times did not name the employees, as they were reportedly not permitted to speak publicly.The TSMC employees are not the only skeptics. “TSMC’s investment in the U.S. from a business perspective makes no sense at all,” said former tech analyst and private equity firm Kirkland Capital Chairman Kirk Yang (楊應超), citing the high cost of the project. Yang believes it is possible TSMC may have embarked on the U.S. based project due to political pressures, but said “so far, the Phoenix project has yielded very little benefit for TSMC or Taiwan.”Constructing the fabs in Arizona is reportedly 10 times more expensive than in Taiwan, a result of unfamiliarity with U.S regulations, and insufficient supply of building materials, The NYT said. High inflation, and competition with Intel, which is also expanding in Arizona, is also reportedly driving up costs.After TSMC founder Morris Chang (張忠謀) told Nancy Pelosi that U.S. plans for the semiconductor manufacturing industry were “incredibly naïve,” Pelosi also reportedly admitted that Taiwanese executives specifically questioned her about whether or not the U.S. environmental and labor laws were sufficient to support such a complicated industry.Labor relations are also at top of mind for the interviewed TSMC employees, who said that they worried the Taiwanese working style might clash with American employees. Eight of the employees interviewed said they believed they would have to pick up the slack for their American counterparts if they were to work alongside them in Arizona.Former TSMC engineer Wayne Chiu, said that he had considered joining the company’s U.S. operations, but abandoned the idea after realizing he would have to make up for his American colleagues’ lack of productivity. Chiu said the biggest issue would not be the technology, but the people.“The most difficult thing is personnel management,” Chiu said. “Americans are the worst at this, because Americans are the most difficult to manage.”",2023/2/23,2130,Business

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818931,US Representative Mike Gallagher urges faster arms delivery to Taiwan,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — U.S. Representative Mike Gallagher urged Washington to prioritize providing weapons to Taiwan in order to deter Chinese aggression.

            “We need to be moving heaven and earth to arm Taiwan to the teeth to avoid a war,” Gallagher told the Washington Post. “Nobody knows if and when Xi Jinping wakes up and decides to do this but all the more reason to put in place a denial posture as quickly as possible.”

            The representative, who just returned from a secret four-day trip to Taiwan, said that his major takeaway was that “the Taiwanese are doing everything we could ask of them” to bolster their defense capabilities.

            Many of the Taiwanese officials he met viewed the war in Ukraine as a wake-up call, he said, adding that he intends to use his position in the newly established House select committee on China to highlight the importance of heavily arming Taiwan.











            “Our best chance of preventing an invasion of Taiwan, and of essentially preventing World War III, is to put actual hard power on Taiwan … and, to paraphrase President Tsai, to ensure that every day, when she wakes up, we are increasing the cost of an invasion for Xi Jinping,” he said.

            Gallagher pointed out that Taiwan is increasing its defense spending to roughly 2.4% of its GDP, while many NATO countries still fail to commit to the 2% of GDP military spending guideline. Taiwan has purchased multiple weapons platforms from the U.S. in recent years but has yet to receive them due to a backlog in orders from other nations.

            In 2021, Taiwan bought 400 Harpoon missiles and 100 launchers for US$1.6 billion (NT$48.6 billion). However, because Saudi Arabia made a purchase of Harpoon missiles before Taiwan, it is ahead in the delivery queue.

            “Taiwan should be moved to the front of the line for the Harpoons,” Gallagher said. For Saudi Arabia to receive the missiles first “doesn’t make any strategic sense to me,” he said.TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — U.S. Representative Mike Gallagher urged Washington to prioritize providing weapons to Taiwan in order to deter Chinese aggression.“We need to be moving heaven and earth to arm Taiwan to the teeth to avoid a war,” Gallagher told the Washington Post. “Nobody knows if and when Xi Jinping wakes up and decides to do this but all the more reason to put in place a denial posture as quickly as possible.”The representative, who just returned from a secret four-day trip to Taiwan, said that his major takeaway was that “the Taiwanese are doing everything we could ask of them” to bolster their defense capabilities.Many of the Taiwanese officials he met viewed the war in Ukraine as a wake-up call, he said, adding that he intends to use his position in the newly established House select committee on China to highlight the importance of heavily arming Taiwan.“Our best chance of preventing an invasion of Taiwan, and of essentially preventing World War III, is to put actual hard power on Taiwan … and, to paraphrase President Tsai, to ensure that every day, when she wakes up, we are increasing the cost of an invasion for Xi Jinping,” he said.Gallagher pointed out that Taiwan is increasing its defense spending to roughly 2.4% of its GDP, while many NATO countries still fail to commit to the 2% of GDP military spending guideline.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818940,Brazil's Bellucci retires at age 35 after Rio Open defeat,"RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Thomaz Bellucci, Brazil’s main flagbearer on the men’s tennis tour for the last decade, has retired after losing in straight sets to sixth-seeded Sebastian Baez 6-3, 6-2 in the first round of the Rio Open. 

            The 35-year-old Bellucci is now preparing to transition into coaching.

            Bellucci won 200 professional matches in his career, lifted four titles and reached a career-high No. 21 in the ATP rankings. He’s one of the five players to win a set 6-0 against Novak Djokovic on clay. He beat Top 10 players six times in his career, including then No. 4-ranked Andy Murray at the Madrid Open in 2011. 











            Bellucci turned pro in 2005 at a time his sports hero, three-time French Open champion and former No. 1 Gustavo Kuerten was active. Brazilians had high expectations the younger player could reach as high as Kuerten, but he almost always fell short — often because of injuries.

            “(You have) the historic second position among Brazilian male players,"" Kuerten said in a video played on the Rio Open arena's big screen after Bellucci's last match. “It is no joke, my boy. I will continue cheering for you. I applaud you and I thank you.”

            Bellucci played eight finals at the elite level and won titles at Gstaad (2009, 2012), Santiago (2010), and Geneva (2015). 

            Still, for many years, he developed a love-hate relationship with Brazilian tennis fans who had no one else but him to place the country's hopes in big tournaments. 

            “When people expect a lot from you, you feel it. When you have several sports heroes in a country, that is diluted among all the athletes. That's what we see in Argentina, Spain, the United States. All have many players. In Brazil it was me playing Grand Slams,” Bellucci said at a press conference. “That wasn't good for me. I pressured myself a lot to advance in the tournaments.”

            He currently ranks No. 915 after almost a full year on the sidelines with an injured left knee.

            “I will miss entering a court with Brazilians all around me, cheering for me from the start. These feelings don't come in any other job,"" Bellucci said. ""But I won't miss the rest of it!”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818948,"Holmstrom, Sorokin lead Islanders to 2-1 win vs. Jets","NEW YORK (AP) — Simon Holmstrom scored the go-ahead goal in the third period and Ilya Sorokin made 24 saves to lead the New York Islanders to a 2-1 victory over the Winnipeg Jets on Wednesday night.

            Sebastian Aho also scored for New York, which won for the third time in four games and extended its winning streak against Winnipeg to six games, dating to March 28, 2019.

            “Everyone is recognizing that we are short a lot of bodies and everyone is committed to doing what you have to do to win the game,” veteran forward Zach Parise said.











            Connor Hellebuyck made 20 saves and Nikolaj Ehlers scored the lone goal for Winnipeg, which completed its four-game road trip (1-3) with a loss.

            With the game tied at 1, Hellebuyck struggled to pick up the loose puck after Matt Martin’s shot from in close created a rebound. Holmstrom was able to fire a shot to the glove side to give New York the lead at 9:57 of the third period. 

            “The more he can get into those areas, the more dangerous he becomes,” Islanders coach Lane Lambert said of Holmstrom. “I thought he did a good job of getting to that spot and they did a good job of finding him.”

            Bo Horvat made two nifty passes on the sequence, setting up Martin for a chance from in close, and then Holmstrom. Martin also picked up an assist on the play to extend his individual point streak to three games.

            Kyle Palmieri drew a slashing penalty with 2:31 remaining to prevent the Jets from tying the game in the closing minutes.

            Ehlers evened the score at 1 with a power-play goal at 4:30 of the second period. The Danish forward wired a wrist shot over the glove of Sorokin from the faceoff circle as he collected his fifth goal of the season in his 22nd game. Josh Morrissey and Kyle Connor assisted.

            Winnipeg outshot New York outshot 11-4 in the middle frame, but was unable to take the lead.

            “Coming down the stretch, you know the games are going to be tight, the margin for error is so slim,” Jets forward Adam Lowry said. “It is tough to create offense out there, two great goalies and two teams that are pretty committed to defense.”

            Aho scored his fifth of the season at 17:35 of the first period to open the scoring. Brock Nelson fired a shot that created a juicy rebound that Aho buried during 4-on-4 action. Winnipeg's Mason Appleton committed a turnover in the offensive zone, which led to the scoring opportunity for New York.

            Ross Johnston and Pierre-Luc Dubois each received two-minute matching roughing penalties, which led to wide-open play that the Islanders were able to capitalize on.

            “Two of the top goalies in the league, you are not going to score at them at will unless you get extremely lucky,” Martin said. “You can expect a close game and Ilya really kept us in through the first two periods. In the third, we have been pretty good at locking it down and capitalizing on our opportunities. 

            ""It really doesn’t matter to me how, it just matters that we get the points and keep moving forward.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818951,Gaw Capital Partners and A3 Capital Jointly Form a JV Platform with the Launch of the first Infinaxis Data Centre in Malaysia,"Malaysian Investment Development Authority (MIDA) and Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation (MDEC) Welcome the JV Partnership to Enhance Digital Infrastructure in Malaysia

SINGAPORE/KUALA LUMPUR, MALAYSIA -  Media OutReach - 23 February 2023 -  Real estate private equity firm Gaw Capital Partners announced today that the firm, has formed a JV platform jointly with  A3 Capital to invest into greenfield and under-performing data centre assets across key markets in the Southeast Asia region. The collaboration is aimed to create a portfolio of Tier-3 certified data centre assets. This JV platform will also launch the  Infinaxis Data Centre platform with a focus on developing Internet Data Centre (IDC) assets across the Southeast Asia region. The data centre assets under the JV platform will be managed by Infinaxis, staffed by an experienced data centre team originally under A3 Capital. The JV platform's first investment is located in Cyberjaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, with other pipeline opportunities in other neighboring countries like Indonesia and Singapore.            Cyberjaya is one of the largest IDC hubs in Malaysia, housing 67 per cent of the Multi-Tenant Data Centre market in Malaysia as of Q2 2021. Considered as the ""Silicon Valley of Malaysia"", Cyberjaya, spanning around 29 square kilometers, is the nucleus of the Multimedia Super Corridor in Malaysia. Cyberjaya houses over 2,000 businesses, including SMEs, startups and multinational companies such as IBM, Fujitsu, Panasonic and Huawei, as well as seven universities, turning it into a regional and global ICT hub. Located in Cyberjaya, the seed investment consists of two greenfield sites with a combined plot area of 12,490 square meters. The JV platform will develop a 12 MW IT load IDC facility on one of the plots. The IT capacity will potentially be doubled in the future, with the second plot to be developed as an expansion site. The data centre assets under the JV platform will be operated by Infinaxis, which consists of seasoned industry experts with decades long track records in data centre, real estate and technology industries.   Kok Chye Ong the Managing Director and Head of IDC Platform, Asia (Ex-China) of Gaw Capital Partners said ""Gaw Capital Partners is honored to work together with Infinaxis Data Centre Holdings as the platform operator. By forming this strong partnership, we will develop, acquire or reposition four to five data centres in different locations throughout Southeast Asia. The data centre demand in Malaysia is underpinned by strong internet traffic and high amount of data consumption. In recent years, the internet data growth in these areas have been further accelerated by the continued digital transformation of enterprises and 5G penetration. Also, several government initiatives over the last decade have made Malaysia an attractive market for data centres. However, the supply of quality data centres has not caught up with the technical demand from customers. We look forward to exploring more investment opportunities in this market.""   Zahri Mirza, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) for Infinaxis further added, ""The outlook for data centre demand in Southeast Asia is indeed highly positive and our collaboration with Gaw Capital will allow us to fast track the delivery of services for our customers. Indeed, through our Gaw Capital partnership we have been able to gain support from MIDA and MDEC in processing the necessary regulatory approvals in a timely manner.""   The Malaysian Investment Development Authority (MIDA) and Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation (MDEC) welcome the JV partnership formed by Gaw Capital Partners and A3 Capital to launch the Infinaxis Data Centre platform, enhancing digital infrastructure in Malaysia. Data center facilities are now at the forefront of innovation and have been supporting the demand for mission-critical digital infrastructures and the cumulative growth of data. Not only do businesses rely on data centers for storage, but for disaster recovery and data management too.   Datuk Wira Arham Abdul Rahman, CEO of MIDA said ""My sincere compliments to Gaw Capital Partners and A3 Capital for launching the Infinaxis Data Centre platform. Malaysia is the location of choice for industry leaders to site their best-in-class data centres. These combined efforts will definitely play a key role in enhancing our digital infrastructure.""   ""The Government is committed to growing Malaysia as a data centre hub by developing infrastructure, facilitating innovation and strengthening frameworks guided by the MyDigital Blueprint and National Investment Policy (NIP). Anchored by the National Investment Aspirations (NIA), the NIP will outline practical strategies to prioritise nurturing innovative, high-impact, high-tech investments that create high value jobs,"" added  Datuk Wira Arham.   Ts. Mahadhir Aziz, CEO of MDEC, said, ""As the nation's lead digital economy agency, we are pleased to have facilitated this expansion in raising the overall infrastructure capacities in the data centre sector. This will be crucial as we seek to continue accelerating the growth of our digital economy, guided by the new national strategic initiative, Malaysia Digital (MD). MDEC will strive to form more effective collaborations and drive further facilitation on this front to ensure that the nation remains competitive and attractive to investments, towards establishing Malaysia as the digital hub of ASEAN.""   The JV platform is committed to incorporating ESG principles. Infinaxis plans to apply a staged implementation of more advanced sustainability features over time, considering the availability of options and unique circumstances at the respective sites. The data centres will be more efficient and sustainable, fundamentally making them more competitive which will increase the platform's long-term value.   Gaw Capital Partners was named 'Alternatives Investor of the Year: Asia' at the PERE Awards 2021 after receiving the largest number of votes in a public ballot of the real estate industry. In recent years, IDC has been a focus sector for Gaw Capital Partners as the data centre industry is one of the cornerstones of the digital economy, which is growing rapidly with broad prospects. The firm was also highlighted for launching two data centre platforms in China and two in Pan-Asia. In September 2020, the firm closed fundraising for its first IDC platform, which invested in a portfolio of projects in partnership with IDC developers and operators in China, bringing the total equity raised to approximately USD1.3 billion with the aim to build ""green, efficient, innovative and recyclable"" data centre clusters.   The Asia region represents as one of the geographic frontiers in the data centre space with greater opportunities. The Gaw Capital data centre platform will also comprise data centres located in China, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam and now in Malaysia.  Hashtag: #GawCapitalPartners

HKDC Chairman, Prof. Eric Yim, remarked, 'The unleash of the design power in Hong Kong could help enhance the competitiveness and better fulfil our key roles under the 14th Five-Year Plan. Taking advantage of these immense opportunities, HKDC will strengthen our mission of raising Hong Kong's position as an international design centre in Asia through signature events like Business of Design Week (BODW) and other programmes. We will continue to work closely with different partners and stakeholders to strengthen the creative industries and foster the continuous growth of the design economy.'   Hong Kong's positioning as an East‑meets‑West centre for international cultural exchange has been laid out clearly as one of the major directions for Hong Kong and its crucial roles in national development, in accordance with the 14th Five-Year Plan. In fulfilling this role, HKDC believes a comprehensive blueprint for fostering the development of the Design Industry and Economy including nurturing a diverse talent pool, enriching arts, cultural and creative content as well as upgrading cultural infrastructure is crucial not only to bring significant cultural values to Hong Kong but also make the design industry become a main driver of economic and environmental values to the wider economy and community.   HKDC welcomes the additional resources for the CreateSmart Initiative and funding support to be provided to implement the flagship events and incubation programmes. Business of Design Week (BODW), HKDC's annual flagship event since 2002, Design Incubation Programme (DIP) and Fashion Incubation Programme (FIP) serve the roles in facilitating creative exchanges and showcasing Hong Kong and Mainland talents to the rest of the world as well as nurturing the design talents.

            Substitute Lineth Cedeno headed the winning goal in the 75th minute to send Panama to its first World Cup, where it play in Group F with Brazil, Jamaica and France.

            Panama is the third team to qualify for the World Cup from a 10-team intercontinental playoff tournament held over the last week in New Zealand. Haiti and Portugal also qualified for the first time.











            The match was tight and there were few shots on goal in the first half until Panama goalkeeper Yenith Bailey saved Jessica Martinez’s curling free kick in stoppage time.

            Again, the keepers weren't tested in the second half until Marta Cox lofted in a long cross from the right with 15 minutes remaining and Cedeno headed powerfully inside the right post.

            Panama now has lost only two of its last 13 matches and has won its last five against South American opponents.

            Before Thursday’s match, head coach Ignacio Quintana said his players “want Panama to celebrate and to bring joy to our country.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819016,Japan's emperor expresses sorrow for people suffering in war,"TOKYO (AP) — Japan's Emperor Naruhito expressed deep sorrow for the suffering of people in conflicts around the world and stressed the importance of dialogue and cooperation in remarks released for his 63rd birthday Thursday.

            Naruhito did not name other countries in his carefully nuanced remarks days before the one-year anniversary of the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

            He said many people affected by war and conflicts have been killed, injured and forced into homelessness, sadness and fear, while others elsewhere suffer under oppression, poverty and prejudices.











            “I feel deep sorrow for the difficult reality that the world faces,” Naruhito said at a palace news conference for Japanese media ahead of his birthday.

            For all people to live peacefully and free of sadness and pain, “I strongly feel the importance for every country to think not only about itself but to engage in dialogue to overcome differences and cooperate in solving problems,” he said. “We face a question of what each of us can do to achieve a peaceful world.”

            On Thursday morning, Naruhito greeted well-wishers cheering and waving small Japanese flags who were allowed to gather at the palace to celebrate his birthday for the first time since he ascended the Chrysanthemum Throne in 2019 after a three-year hiatus due to the pandemic.

            “I’m truly delighted to have my birthday celebration with everyone this way for the first time (as Emperor),"" he said in a short address from the palace balcony.

            He and his family all were dressed formally and wore masks during the brief appearance. Naruhito was accompanied by Empress Masako and their daughter, Princess Aiko, now 23, as well as Naruhito's younger brother, Crown Prince Akishino, and his family.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819025,Mexico's Senate approves controversial electoral reform,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico’s Senate on Wednesday approved a reform of the country’s electoral institute, a move that opponents say will undercut democracy but which the president contends will save money and reduce political privileges.

            Lawmakers voted 72-50 in favor of the controversial overhaul of the body overseeing Mexico’s elections. Opponents immediately said they will challenge the changes in the supreme court. Protests are planned in multiple cities.

            The reform still needs to be enacted by President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, but that is seen as a formality since he backs the initiative, which would reduce the size of the institute and limit its supervisory and sanctioning powers.











            Some opposition lawmakers held up posters reading: “Morena wants to steal the elections,” referring to López Obrador’s ruling Morena party. Mexico has presidential elections scheduled for next year.

            The legislative initiative, known as “Plan B”, was proposed by the president in December after he did not obtain enough votes in Congress for a constitutional reform that carried deeper electoral changes.

            The president has repeatedly denied that the reform package could put the elections in Mexico at risk, saying the initiative seeks to cut the National Electoral Institute’s large budget and end its privileges.

            López Obrador and his supporters have been critical of the electoral institute since 2006 when he came within 0.56% of the vote of winning the presidency and denounced his loss as fraudulent. He and his supporters launched a mass protest movement.

            Despite the institute confirming his landslide victory in 2018, López Obrador has repeatedly complained of how costly it is to run elections in Mexico and sought to curtail the institute’s budget. He frequently says that the independent body is in the hands of the elite.

            Some Mexicans see similarities to the rhetoric used by former U.S. President Donald Trump and ex-Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro ahead of elections in those countries that aimed to erode confidence in the process.

            Many in Mexico see the electoral institute as a key pillar of the country’s modern democracy. After 71 years of uninterrupted single-party rule, the opposition finally broke through in 2000. 

            López Obrador’s ruling Morena party is favored in next year's national elections and the opposition is in disarray, which would seem to give the president little incentive to attack the electoral institute. He remains highly popular in Mexico, but is not eligible for re-election.

            Lorenzo Córdova, the institute’s leader, has aggressively defended it in public and framed the reforms as a threat to Mexico’s democracy. His outspokenness has made him a frequent target of López Obrador.

            After Wednesday's vote, the institute said via Twitter that the reform “puts at risk the equity and transparency of the elections” by weakening the sanctions the institute can apply to candidates and parties that violate campaign finance rules.

            Even before Wednesday night’s vote, the opposition had called a march in Mexico City Sunday in defense of the institute. The opposition held a similar march in November, which was ridiculed by López Obrador who led an even larger march days later.

            The president had already worried some observers by frequently attacking Mexico's judiciary and concentrating enormous responsibility in the hands of the military, raising questions about his respect for the country's democratic institutions.MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico’s Senate on Wednesday approved a reform of the country’s electoral institute, a move that opponents say will undercut democracy but which the president contends will save money and reduce political privileges.Lawmakers voted 72-50 in favor of the controversial overhaul of the body overseeing Mexico’s elections.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819041,Qantas back in black with $978 million half-year profit,"SYDNEY (AP) — Australian national carrier Qantas posted an underlying pre-tax half-year profit of 1.43 billion Australian dollars ($978 million) on Thursday in the airline's first return to profit since the coronavirus pandemic started three years ago.

            The first-half result for the six months through December was at the top end of the airline’s forecast for an underlying profit between AU$1.35 billion ($923 million) and AU$1.45 billion ($991 million).

            The statutory net profit for the six months was AU$1 billion ($684 million), compared to a AU$456 million ($312 million) net loss a year earlier.











            Australia had some of the world’s toughest restrictions on international and domestic travel during the pandemic, which hit the Sydney-based airline hard. Australia's final pandemic travel restrictions were lifted a year ago.

            Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said the airline had planned for a quick rebound in profitability.

            “When we restructured the business at the start of COVID, it was to make sure we could bounce back quickly when travel returned,” Joyce said.

            “That’s effectively what’s happened, but it’s the strength of the demand that has driven such a strong result,” he added.

            A rebound in air travel demand pushed Qantas to revenue of AU$9.9 billion ($6.8 billion), more than three times the figure for the same period a year earlier.

            “While interest rates and inflation are expected to hit discretionary spending at some point, we have yet to see any signs of that,” Joyce said in a media briefing.

            “In fact, research shows that travel is one area that people want to prioritize over the next 12 months,” he added.

            Qantas’ profit turnaround comes after three years and AU$7 billion ($4.8 billion) in statutory losses due to the pandemic, and was delivered despite fuel costs soaring 65% from pre-pandemic levels last year amid energy shortages caused by the Russia-Ukraine war.

            All segments of Qantas' business turned profitable during the half year, led by Qantas Domestic, which recorded AU$785 million ($537 million) in earnings before interest and tax, compared to a AU$613 million ($419 million) loss a year ago.SYDNEY (AP) — Australian national carrier Qantas posted an underlying pre-tax half-year profit of 1.43 billion Australian dollars ($978 million) on Thursday in the airline's first return to profit since the coronavirus pandemic started three years ago.The first-half result for the six months through December was at the top end of the airline’s forecast for an underlying profit between AU$1.35 billion ($923 million) and AU$1.45 billion ($991 million).The statutory net profit for the six months was AU$1 billion ($684 million), compared to a AU$456 million ($312 million) net loss a year earlier.Australia had some of the world’s toughest restrictions on international and domestic travel during the pandemic, which hit the Sydney-based airline hard.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819042,"Roberts scores 26, No. 1 Houston beats Tulane 89-59","HOUSTON (AP) — J’Wan Roberts had a career-high 26 points and seven rebounds, Marcus Sasser scored 22 points and No. 1 Houston clinched at least a share of the American Athletic Conference regular season championship with an 89-59 win over Tulane on Wednesday night.

            Houston (26-2, 14-1) has won eight straight games.

            Houston coach Kelvin Sampson said the consistency in winning the title four out of five seasons is what he’s most proud of.











            “It’s hard for me to talk about that,” Sampson said. “I don’t know where to start, what to say. I just think staying humble. I do the best I can to coach these kids, put them in the best position to win and for them to be successful. I’ve got a great staff. We all work in conjunction with each other. We’ve been winning around here for a long time.”

            Roberts has scored at least 20 points in consecutive games, and Sasser, who also had five rebounds and six assists, has scored at least 20 points in four straight and nine overall this season.

            “I still feel like we haven’t reached our ceiling,” Sasser said. “That’s always a positive heading into March. We want to be playing our best basketball in March.”

            Tramon Mark added 13 points, and Jamal Shead had 10 points and six assists. Houston outrebounded Tulane 46-27, with Jarace Walker leading the way with a career-high 13 rebounds. 

            “Our effort is getting better,” Shead said. “A lot of people are playing a lot harder for a longer amount of time. That’s just one thing that we’ve been harping on: playing harder and playing a full 40 minutes.”

            The Cougars shot 47%, including 10 of 32 on 3-pointers.

            Jalen Cook scored 23 points for his seventh straight game with at least 20 points for Tulane (17-8, 10-4), which saw its five-game winning streak snapped. Jaylen Forbes added 14 points.

            “We just ran into a buzzsaw,” Tulane coach Ron Hunter said. “They played well. They wanted to win the league. They want that No. 1 seed in the tournament. That’s how they played. We’ve been playing good basketball, but it’s more what they did. (Sampson) has this team playing really well right now.”

            The Green Wave shot 38%, including 7 of 22 on 3-pointers.

            “Nothing we did today was good,” Hunter said. “They played like the best team in the country today, so they won.”

            Houston used a 22-5 run over an eight-minute stretch of the first half to open up a 35-17 lead ending with a 3-pointer by Sasser with five minutes remaining in the half.

            BIG PICTURE

            “Our team is getting better at certain things,” Sampson said of Houston’s defense. “We’re getting better at our point of attack defense, loading to the ball, our stunts, all the things that we emphasize and teach. We just continue to get better.”

(AP) — Wendell Green Jr. scored 13 of his 23 points in the final six minutes — including going 6 for 6 from the free-throw line in the final 30 seconds — and Johni Broome scored 19 points on 8-of-13 shooting to help Auburn beat Mississippi 78-74 Wednesday night after blowing a 12-point second-half lead. 

            Jaylin Williams added 12 points for Auburn (19-9, 9-6) and Allen Flanigan had 11 points, six rebounds and five assists. 

            Green hit Williams on a back-door cut for a two-hand dunk, converted a three-point play and then made a layup before Broome made back-to-back baskets and Green added another layup that capped a 13-4 run that gave the Tigers the lead for good at 70-64 with 3:38 to play. 











            James White — who went into the game shooting just 15.8% (3 of 19) from 3-point range — made his second 3 of the game to cut Mississippi's deficit to 74-73 with 14 seconds left but Green made four foul shots to seal it. 

            Auburn had lost four of its last five and six of eight.

            Matthew Murrell led the Rebels with 23 points. Myles Burns had 14 points, six rebounds and six steals and White finished with 13-points on 5-of-9 shooting, 2 of 2 from 3-point range. Burns has 66 steals this season. 

            Zep Jasper and Flanigan hit back-to-back 3-pointers to give Auburn its biggest lead at 46-34 with 18:10 left in the game and Flanigan threw down a dunk to give the Tigers a 10-point lead with 13:28 remaining. The Tigers went 0 for 5 from the field and committed three turnovers as Ole Miss scored 15 of the next 17 points — including seven by Murrell — to take a 60-57 lead with 8:52 to go. 

            Ole Miss (10-18, 2-13 SEC) has lost four games in a row and nine of its last 10. The Rebels have just two wins in 17 games since beating Temple 63-55 on Dec. 17. 

            Auburn outscored the Rebels 22-20 from the free-throw line despite shooting eight fewer foul shots than Ole Miss (32).

            Bacot grabbed 11 rebounds for his 67th career double-double, tying him with Tom Burleson for the fourth most in ACC history. Tim Duncan had the most with 87.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819085,"Harvey Weinstein gets 16 more years for rape, sexual assault","LOS ANGELES (AP) — A Los Angeles judge on Thursday sentenced Harvey Weinstein to 16 more years in prison after a jury convicted him of the rape and sexual assault of an Italian actor and model, furthering the fall of the onetime movie magnate who became a #MeToo magnet.

            The prison term, along with the 23 years he received in 2020 for a similar conviction in New York, amounts to a likely life sentence for the 70-year-old.

            Weinstein, sitting in a wheelchair and wearing jail attire, directly appealed to Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Lisa B. Lench, saying: “I maintain that I’m innocent. I never raped or sexually assaulted Jane Doe 1. "" The woman who Weinstein was convicted of raping sobbed in the courtroom as he spoke.











            Moments earlier she had told the judge about the pain she felt after being attacked by Weinstein. “Before that night I was a very happy and confident woman. I valued myself and the relationship I had with God,” the woman, who was identified in court only as Jane Doe 1, said through tears as she stood at a lectern behind prosecutors. “I was excited about my future. Everything changed after the defendant brutally assaulted me. There is no prison sentence long enough to undo the damage.”

            
                Jurors in December convicted Weinstein of one count of rape and two counts of sexual assault against the woman who at the trial’s opening in October gave a dramatic and emotional account of him arriving uninvited at her hotel room during a 2013 film festival in the run-up to the Oscars, talking his way in and assaulting her during a film festival.

            Lench sentenced Weinstein to eight years for a forcible rape count, six years for forcible oral copulation and two years for forcible penetration with a foreign object, for a combined 16 years.

            His attorneys requested that she sentence him to three years for each count, and have the sentences run simultaneously.

            “Mr. Weinstein did a lot of good for a lot of people in a 50 year career, “ Weinstein lawyer Mark Werksman told the judge. ”He was a man that many famous movie stars would thank in their Oscar speeches.”

            Werksman cited Weinstein's age and very poor health, suggesting a long sentence would make it unlikely he would ever see his five children outside of prison.

            Jane Doe 1 could be heard crying in court throughout Werksman and Weinstein's remarks to the judge.

            “This is a made up story. Jane Doe 1 is an actress. She can turn the tears on,” said Weinstein, who insisted he had never met the woman. “Please don’t sentence me to life in prison. I don’t deserve it. There are so many things wrong with this case.”

            The jury acquitted Weinstein of the sexual battery of a massage therapist and failed to reach verdicts on counts involving two other women.

            “Today, justice prevailed for survivors,"" the massage therapist, known during trial as Jane Doe 3, said in a statement issued through her attorney after the sentencing. “No woman has to fear Harvey Weinstein again as he will never leave prison.”

            The defense contends that Weinstein had consensual sex with two of the women he was charged with assaulting and that two others were making up the incidents entirely.

            Lench handed down the sentence Thursday after rejecting a motion by Weinstein’s lawyers for a new trial. In arguments they said the judge was wrong to exclude from evidence messages showing that the Italian model had a sexual relationship with the director of the film festival she was visiting during the attack.

            Defense attorney Alan Jackson said that rape shield laws excluding the sexual history of a victim were not relevant here, because the defense would have used the messages to show that the woman perjured herself and damaged her credibility when she testified that she and the festival director, Pascal Videcomini, were merely friends and colleagues.

            “If the jury had known that Jane Doe 1 and Pascal were intimately involved, they never would have bought the story that was told,” Jackson said. “We know they wouldn’t have bought it. Because some of them have said so.”

            Jackson argued that the messages would also have bolstered defense arguments that the woman was not even in her hotel room, where she testified the attack occurred, but was with Vicedomini.

            The defense had given the judge affidavits from jurors, two of whom were in the audience for the sentencing, that the evidence might have made them decide differently.

            Lench called the juror statements “speculation” about how the evidence would have played out that were not relevant under the law. 

            The two jurors, who only gave their first names Michael and Jay, told reporters outside the courtroom that they were not there to advocate for either side, but said hearing about the messages might have changed deliberations.

            The issue is likely to be at the forefront of Weinstein's upcoming appeal.

            Prosecutors and Weinstein’s attorneys declined comment on the sentence.

            The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they have been sexually assaulted.

            Legal uncertainties remain on both coasts for Weinstein.

            
                New York's highest court has agreed to hear his appeal in his rape and sexual assault convictions there. And prosecutors in Los Angeles have yet to say whether they will retry Weinstein on counts they were unable to reach a verdict on. A hearing on the possible retrial is scheduled for next month.

            Weinstein is eligible for parole in New York in 2039.

            For more on the Harvey Weinstein trial, visit: https://apnews.com/hub/harvey-weinsteinLOS ANGELES (AP) — A Los Angeles judge on Thursday sentenced Harvey Weinstein to 16 more years in prison after a jury convicted him of the rape and sexual assault of an Italian actor and model, furthering the fall of the onetime movie magnate who became a #MeToo magnet.The prison term, along with the 23 years he received in 2020 for a similar conviction in New York, amounts to a likely life sentence for the 70-year-old.Weinstein, sitting in a wheelchair and wearing jail attire, directly appealed to Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Lisa B. Lench, saying: “I maintain that I’m innocent. I never raped or sexually assaulted Jane Doe 1. "" The woman who Weinstein was convicted of raping sobbed in the courtroom as he spoke.Moments earlier she had told the judge about the pain she felt after being attacked by Weinstein. “Before that night I was a very happy and confident woman. I valued myself and the relationship I had with God,” the woman, who was identified in court only as Jane Doe 1, said through tears as she stood at a lectern behind prosecutors. “I was excited about my future. Everything changed after the defendant brutally assaulted me. There is no prison sentence long enough to undo the damage.”Jurors in December convicted Weinstein of one count of rape and two counts of sexual assault against the woman who at the trial’s opening in October gave a dramatic and emotional account of him arriving uninvited at her hotel room during a 2013 film festival in the run-up to the Oscars, talking his way in and assaulting her during a film festival.Lench sentenced Weinstein to eight years for a forcible rape count, six years for forcible oral copulation and two years for forcible penetration with a foreign object, for a combined 16 years.His attorneys requested that she sentence him to three years for each count, and have the sentences run simultaneously.“Mr. Weinstein did a lot of good for a lot of people in a 50 year career, “ Weinstein lawyer Mark Werksman told the judge. ”He was a man that many famous movie stars would thank in their Oscar speeches.”Werksman cited Weinstein's age and very poor health, suggesting a long sentence would make it unlikely he would ever see his five children outside of prison.Jane Doe 1 could be heard crying in court throughout Werksman and Weinstein's remarks to the judge.“This is a made up story. Jane Doe 1 is an actress. She can turn the tears on,” said Weinstein, who insisted he had never met the woman. “Please don’t sentence me to life in prison. I don’t deserve it.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819087,Dems consider break with tradition to get Biden more judges,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Even as Democrats celebrated the 100th judicial confirmation of Joe Biden's presidency, they are clamoring for more — and some are flirting with ending a century-long Senate practice to help make it happen.

            The rising friction over what in Washington parlance is known as the “blue slip” is creating tensions on the Senate panel that handles judicial nominations and prompting stern warnings from Republicans about a dangerous escalation in the partisanship that already dominates the judicial confirmation process.

            The clash over Senate procedure could have major ramifications for Biden as he seeks to fill as many court vacancies as possible during the final two years of his term. Aghast at the speed with which Republicans approved judges during the Trump era, Democrats have made the confirmation to the courts a top priority, vowing to fill every seat possible. Their focus on the nominations is even greater now that Republicans control the House and can stall much of Biden's broader legislative agenda. 











            Since at least 1917, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee has sent a blue-colored form, or “blue slip,"" to the senators representing the home state of a judicial nominee. A blue slip returned with a positive response signals the senator's approval of moving forward with a nomination hearing. But if the blue slip is not returned or comes back with a negative response, that means the home state senator objects, which can doom the nomination. 

            Republicans during Donald Trump's presidency determined the lack of a positive blue slip would not stop them from moving forward with considering appellate court nominees — and they did so 17 times. Democrats were livid, pointing out that Republicans blocked several of President Barack Obama's appellate nominees by declining to return a positive blue slip. 

            Now, Democrats are being encouraged to follow suit and do away with the blue slip when it comes to the district judges whose courts serve as the starting point for federal civil and criminal cases.

            ”In many respects, it is an archaic holdover from a different era,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn. “I think we’re maybe reaching the point of deciding whether it will be continued.”

            Advocates for doing away with the blue slip say fast action is critical if Democrats want to have the kind of success Trump had in year three of his presidency, when he secured more than 100 judicial confirmations out of 231. They believe Democrats can't afford to wait months on Republican senators to give their go-ahead for a nominee.

            Besides, they argue, if Democrats don't do away with the blue slip now, Republicans will abolish it when they return to the majority.

            “Democrats would be chumps to say, ‘Oh well, we're not going to do this because it's a tradition,'"" said Russ Feingold, the former three-term Democratic senator from Wisconsin who now serves as president of the American Constitution Society. The group is a liberal counter to the conservative Federalist Society.

            The New York Times editorial board also weighed in recently, saying it was “far past time"" for the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee to end the blue slip practice.

            The chairman, Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., has clearly heard some of the concerns voiced by progressives. He has made it a point recently to emphasize how Democrats submitted 130 positive blue slips for district court nominees during the Trump presidency, but so far, Republicans have only done so about a dozen times.

            That's essentially because Biden has been filling judicial vacancies of predominately Democratic-appointed judges in blue states. Soon, it will get harder. There are about 40 district court vacancies that will require a blue slip from at least one Republican senator. Many of those vacancies don’t have a nominee yet, and Durbin is clearly sending a signal to GOP senators to work expeditiously with the White House on submitting prospective nominees. 

            Durbin said he wants to continue with the blue slip tradition, but he's adding a caveat: that they aren't used for “discriminatory purposes"" to block consideration of nominees based on race, gender or sexual orientation.

            His comments have alarmed Republican senators. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said the blue slip courtesy is “very much at stake and at risk here."" He also questioned how Durbin is going to discern the motivations of Republicans senators if they object to a nominee.

            “The last thing left in this body that makes the Senate the Senate, in my view, and gives a senator a say about a consequential decision in their state that will last a lifetime is the blue slip process,"" Graham said. “So I would just hope we could agree, if possible, that no matter how frustrated we get, we're going to honor this system.""

            So far, only one Biden nominee for a district court has had their nomination derailed because a senator withheld a blue slip, William Pocan, nominated to the Eastern District of Wisconsin. Republican Sen. Ron Johnson withheld his blue slip, saying he had heard concerns from the Green Bay legal community that they needed a judge locally based and active in their community. 

            Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said complaints about the blue slip are “orchestrated and contrived."" He said that he and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, were asked by the White House to submit names for an appellate court vacancy within three weeks, which they did.

            “And eight months later, the administration finally gets around to nominating somebody,"" Cornyn said. “We've got two district court vacancies where we have not been contacted at all by the White House counsel. So, most of the delay is because the administration has been slow in filling these nominees, these vacancies.""

            Cornyn likened the efforts to ending the blue slip to Democratic calls for ending the filibuster so that legislation would only need a simple majority to advance rather than 60 votes.

            “They want to fully dismantle the Senate as an institution,"" he said.

            Proponents of the blue slip say its most important feature is to encourage collaboration and compromise. Durbin said he provided eight positive blue slips after negotiating on nominees with the Trump White House. “I had to give a little. They did, too,"" he said.

            But Feingold, who served 16 years on the Judiciary panel and 18 years in the Senate, said he believes presidents will continue to consult with senators on judicial openings even without the blue slip, because they need a lawmaker's votes on other priorities. 

            “You need to consult them anyway because if you try to jam somebody really bad down their throat, they are going to remember it,"" Feingold said.

            Blumenthal said he will bring lessons learned from the Obama years to the debate, and he’s determined not to let Republicans block district judges through the blue slip process the way they did appellate court judges.

            “The history is undeniable that Republicans succeeded in blocking many of the Obama nominees, and therefore held open judgeships, which they then filled with alacrity,” Blumenthal said. “We’re not going to let that happen again.”WASHINGTON (AP) — Even as Democrats celebrated the 100th judicial confirmation of Joe Biden's presidency, they are clamoring for more — and some are flirting with ending a century-long Senate practice to help make it happen.The rising friction over what in Washington parlance is known as the “blue slip” is creating tensions on the Senate panel that handles judicial nominations and prompting stern warnings from Republicans about a dangerous escalation in the partisanship that already dominates the judicial confirmation process.The clash over Senate procedure could have major ramifications for Biden as he seeks to fill as many court vacancies as possible during the final two years of his term.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819118,US mass killings linked to extremism spiked over last decade,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The number of U.S. mass killings linked to extremism over the past decade was at least three times higher than the total from any other 10-year period since the 1970s, according to a report by the Anti-Defamation League.

            The report, provided to The Associated Press ahead of its public release Thursday, also found that all extremist killings identified in 2022 were linked to right-wing extremism, with an especially high number linked to white supremacy. They include a racist mass shooting at a supermarket in Buffalo, New York, that left 10 Black shoppers dead and a mass shooting that killed five people at an LGBT nightclub in Colorado Springs, Colorado. 

            “It is not an exaggeration to say that we live in an age of extremist mass killings,” the report from the group's Center on Extremism says.











            Between two and seven domestic extremism-related mass killings occurred every decade from the 1970s to the 2000s, but in the 2010s that number skyrocketed to 21, the report found. 

            The trend has since continued with five domestic extremist mass killings in 2021 and 2022, as many as there were during the first decade of the new millennium. 

            The number of victims has risen as well. Between 2010 and 2020, 164 people died in ideological extremist-related mass killings, according to the report. That’s much more than in any other decade except the 1990s, when the bombing of a federal building in Oklahoma City killed 168 people. 

            Extremist killings are those carried out by people with ties to extreme movements and ideologies.

            Several factors combined to drive the numbers up between 2010 and 2020. There were shootings inspired by the rise of the Islamic State group as well as a handful targeting police officers after civilian shootings and others linked to the increasing promotion of violence by white supremacists, said Mark Pitcavage, a senior research fellow at the ADL’s Center on Extremism. 

            The center tracks slayings linked to various forms of extremism in the United States and compiles them in an annual report. It tracked 25 extremism-related killings last year, a decrease from the 33 the year before. 

            Ninety-three percent of the killings in 2022 were committed with firearms. The report also noted that no police officers were killed by extremists last year, for the first time since 2011. 

            With the waning of the Islamic State group, the main threat in the near future will likely be white supremacist shooters, the report found. The increase in the number of mass killing attempts, meanwhile, is one of the most alarming trends in recent years, said Center on Extremism Vice President Oren Segal. 

            “We cannot stand idly by and accept this as the new norm,” Segal said.WASHINGTON (AP) — The number of U.S. mass killings linked to extremism over the past decade was at least three times higher than the total from any other 10-year period since the 1970s, according to a report by the Anti-Defamation League.The report, provided to The Associated Press ahead of its public release Thursday, also found that all extremist killings identified in 2022 were linked to right-wing extremism, with an especially high number linked to white supremacy. They include a racist mass shooting at a supermarket in Buffalo, New York, that left 10 Black shoppers dead and a mass shooting that killed five people at an LGBT nightclub in Colorado Springs, Colorado.“It is not an exaggeration to say that we live in an age of extremist mass killings,” the report from the group's Center on Extremism says.Between two and seven domestic extremism-related mass killings occurred every decade from the 1970s to the 2000s, but in the 2010s that number skyrocketed to 21, the report found.The trend has since continued with five domestic extremist mass killings in 2021 and 2022, as many as there were during the first decade of the new millennium.The number of victims has risen as well.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819119,"Word war: In Russia-Ukraine war, information became a weapon","WASHINGTON (AP) — Russia's invasion of Ukraine is the deadliest conflict in Europe since World War II, and the first to see algorithms and TikTok videos deployed alongside fighter planes and tanks.

            The online fight has played out on computer screens and smartphones around the globe as Russia used disinformation, propaganda and conspiracy theories to justify its invasion, silence domestic opposition and sow discord among its adversaries.

            Now in its second year, the war is likely to spawn even more disinformation as Russia looks to break the will of Ukraine and its allies.











            “The natural question is: What's next to come? We know that Russia is preparing for a protracted conflict,” said Samantha Lewis, a manager of strategic geopolitics with the cybersecurity firm Recorded Future. “Ukrainian morale is almost certainly a key target of Russian psychological operations. And there’s the risk of international complacency.""

            A look at Russia's disinformation war since the conflict began:

            DIVIDE AND CONQUER

            The Kremlin's propaganda efforts against Ukraine began many years ago and increased sharply in the months immediately before the invasion, according to Ksenia Iliuk, a Ukrainian disinformation expert who has tracked Russia's information operations.

            Russia tailored the messages for specific audiences around the world.

            In Eastern Europe, Russia spread baseless rumors of Ukrainian refugees committing crimes or taking local jobs. In Western Europe, the message was that corrupt Ukrainian leaders couldn't be trusted, and that a long war could escalate or lead to higher food and oil prices.

            In Latin America, Russia’s local embassies spread Spanish-language claims suggesting its invasion of Ukraine was a struggle against Western imperialism. Similar messages accusing the U.S. of hypocrisy and belligerence were spread in Asia, Africa and other parts of the world with a history of colonialism.

            Russia's information agencies flooded Ukraine with propaganda, calling its military weak and its leaders ineffective and corrupt. But if the message was intended to reduce resistance to the invaders, it backfired in the face of Ukrainian defiance, Iliuk said.

            “Russian propaganda has been failing in Ukraine,"" she said. “Russian propaganda and disinformation are indeed a threat and can be very sophisticated. But it's not always working. It's not always finding an audience.”

            BLAME THE VICTIM

            Many of Russia's fabrications try to justify the invasion or blame others for atrocities carried out by its forces.

            After Russian soldiers tortured and executed civilians in Bucha last spring, images of charred corpses and people shot at close range horrified the world. Russian state TV, however, claimed the corpses were actors, and that the devastation was faked. Associated Press journalists saw the bodies themselves.

            Russia initially celebrated a missile strike on a rail station in the Ukrainian town of Kramatorsk, until reports of civilian casualties surfaced. Suddenly Russian news outlets were insisting the missile wasn't theirs.

            “When they realized that civilians were killed and injured, they changed the messaging, trying to promote the idea that it was a Ukrainian missile,” said Roman Osadchuk, a research associate at the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab, which has tracked Russian disinformation since before the war began.

            One of the most popular conspiracy theories about the war also had Russian help. According to the claim, the U.S. runs a series of secret germ warfare labs in Ukraine — labs conducting work dangerous enough to justify Russia's invasion.

            Like many conspiracy theories, the hoax is rooted in some truth. The U.S. has funded biological research in Ukraine, but the labs are not owned by the U.S., and their existence is far from secret.

            The work is part of an initiative called the Biological Threat Reduction Program, which aims to reduce the likelihood of deadly outbreaks, whether natural or manmade. The U.S. efforts date back to work in the 1990s to dismantle the former Soviet Union’s program for weapons of mass destruction.

            EXTENDED WHACK-A-MOLE

            As European governments and U.S.-based tech companies looked for ways to turn off the Kremlin's propaganda megaphone, Russia found new ways to get its message out.

            Early in the war, Russia relied heavily on state media outlets like RT and Sputnik to spread pro-Russian talking points as well as false claims about the conflict. 

            Platforms like Facebook and Twitter responded by adding labels to the accounts of Russian state media and government officials. When the European Union called for a ban on Russian state media, YouTube responded by blocking the channels of RT and Sputnik. TikTok, owned by a Chinese company now based in Singapore, did the same.

            Russia then pivoted again to tap its diplomats, who have used their Twitter and Facebook accounts to spread false narratives about the war and Russian atrocities. Many platforms are reluctant to censor or suspend diplomatic accounts, giving ambassadors an added layer of protection.

            After its state media was muzzled, Russia expanded its use of networks of fake social media accounts. It also evaded bans on its accounts by taking identifying features — such as RT's logo — off of videos before reposting them.

            Some efforts were sophisticated, like a sprawling network of fake accounts that linked to websites created to look like real German and British newspapers. Meta identified and removed that network from its platforms last fall.

            Others were far cruder, employing fake accounts that were easily spotted before they could even attract a following.

            “These campaigns resembled smash and grab operations that used thousands of fake accounts,” Nick Clegg, Meta’s president of global affairs told reporters on a conference call Wednesday. “This covert activity is aggressive and it is persistent.”

            GETTING AHEAD OF THE CLAIMS

            Ukraine and its allies scored early victories in the information war by predicting Russia's next moves and by revealing them publicly. 

            Weeks before the war, U.S. intelligence officials learned that Russia planned to carry out an attack that it would blame on Ukraine as a pretext for invasion. Instead of withholding the information, the government publicized it as a way to disrupt Russia's plans.

            By “ prebutting ” Russia's claims, the U.S. and its allies were attempting to blunt the impact of disinformation. The next month, the White House did it again when it disclosed suspicions that Russia might seek to blame a chemical or biological attack on Ukraine.

            The invasion prompted tech companies to try new strategies, too. Google, the owner of YouTube, launched a pilot program in Eastern Europe designed to help internet users detect and avoid misinformation about refugees fleeing the war. The initiative utilized short online videos that teach people how misinformation can trick the brain.

            The project was so successful that Google now plans to roll out a similar campaign in Germany.

            Iliuk, the Ukrainian disinformation researcher, said she believes there's a greater awareness now, a year after the invasion, of the dangers posed by Russian disinformation, and a growing optimism that it can be checked.

            “It is very hard, especially when you hear the bombs outside of your window,” she said. “There was this huge realization that this (Russian disinformation) is a threat. That this is something that could literally kill us.”WASHINGTON (AP) — Russia's invasion of Ukraine is the deadliest conflict in Europe since World War II, and the first to see algorithms and TikTok videos deployed alongside fighter planes and tanks.The online fight has played out on computer screens and smartphones around the globe as Russia used disinformation, propaganda and conspiracy theories to justify its invasion, silence domestic opposition and sow discord among its adversaries.Now in its second year, the war is likely to spawn even more disinformation as Russia looks to break the will of Ukraine and its allies.“The natural question is: What's next to come?

            Playing without the Western Conference lead for the first time in more than a month, the Central Division-leading Stars lost their fifth consecutive game — the past two against last-place teams — and have just two wins in 10 games.

            The Central cellar-dwelling Blackhawks won their fourth in a row, rallying from a 3-0 deficit in the second period. The first two goals came when Kane and Domi assisted on each other’s tallies. Both finished with three points, and Seth Jones had two assists against his hometown team.











            Tyler Seguin and captain Jamie Benn scored 1:19 apart in the first period for the Stars before Jason Robertson ended an 0-for-21 skid on the Dallas power play with his team-leading 35th goal just six seconds into the man advantage in the second.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819121,"Kane, Domi lead big Blackhawks rally in 4-3 win over Stars","DALLAS (AP) — Patrick Kane keeps scoring as the trade talk keeps swirling.

            Kane and Max Domi scored two goals apiece, and the Chicago Blackhawks erased a three-goal deficit in a 4-3 victory over the Dallas Stars on Wednesday night.

            Playing without the Western Conference lead for the first time in more than a month, the Central Division-leading Stars lost their fifth consecutive game — the past two against last-place teams — and have just two wins in 10 games.











            The Central cellar-dwelling Blackhawks won their fourth in a row, rallying from a 3-0 deficit in the second period. The first two goals came when Kane and Domi assisted on each other's tallies. 

            Both finished with three points, and Seth Jones had two assists against his hometown team.

            The Stars are among the teams presumably interested in trading for Kane before next week's deadline. It isn't affecting the 34-year-old who has spent all 16 of his NHL seasons with the Blackhawks. Kane has three multi-goal games in the past four for seven total.

            “I think the guys in here have been really good about not necessarily talking about the subject,” said Kane, who has 16 goals. “There’s a lot of guys in here that are probably going through the same thing. We’re all kind of in the same boat.”

            Tyler Seguin and captain Jamie Benn scored 79 seconds apart in the first period for the Stars before Jason Robertson ended an 0-for-21 skid on the Dallas power play with his team-leading 35th goal just six seconds into the man advantage in the second.

            The Stars had a rush in the final seconds after pulling goalie Jake Oettinger, and a shot from Seguin went in. But replay showed it was clearly after the clock ran out.

            A night earlier, Kane had a breakaway in the closing seconds of overtime against Vegas, but the goal was ruled to have been after time expired. The Blackhawks won in a shootout.

            “I still think that was a goal,” Domi said with a smile. “I watched it like 100 times. I'm like, ‘I still think it’s a goal.' But we won, so who cares?”

            
                Domi's tiebreaking goal early in the third period was unassisted after he blocked a shot from Colin Miller near the blue line, chased down the ricochet and beat Oettinger on the breakaway.

            
                Domi started the rally when the Blackhawks had 30 seconds of a power play after a 4-on-4. Kane was alone behind the net with the puck and slipped a pass to Domi for his 16th.

            Five minutes later, Domi stole a puck near center ice, went in 2-on-1 and passed to Kane behind Oettinger for the easy goal. 

            
                Kane beat Oettinger on the stick side again for the tying goal on a pass from Philipp Kurashev with 1:55 remaining in the second.

            “I think it’s definitely a punch in the gut,” Robertson said. “We gave up three 2-on-1 goals today and that can’t happen, especially when we’re in this little rut to begin with.”

            
                Benn’s no-look goal for a 2-0 Dallas lead came with him staring down 19-year-old rookie teammate Wyatt Johnston on a 2-on-1 before sending a wrist shot past Jaxson Stauber inside the far post.

            
                Seguin opened the scoring when he tracked down a loose puck in the offensive zone, faked his way past Domi and beat Stauber from between the circles. It was almost the same spot where moments earlier Stauber made a glove save on Seguin.

            TRADING FOR TRADE PIECE?

            The Blackhawks acquired defenseman Nikita Zaitsev and draft picks from Ottawa for future considerations. Chicago got a 2023 second-round pick and 2026 fourth in exchange for taking on the remainder of Zaitsev’s contract. 

            The 31-year-old Russian is signed through next season at a salary cap hit of $4.5 million. Chicago can send Zaitsev to another team before the March 3 trade deadline or any time over the next year.

It was almost the same spot where moments earlier Stauber made a glove save on Seguin.TRADING FOR TRADE PIECE?The Blackhawks acquired defenseman Nikita Zaitsev and draft picks from Ottawa for future considerations. Chicago got a 2023 second-round pick and 2026 fourth in exchange for taking on the remainder of Zaitsev’s contract.The 31-year-old Russian is signed through next season at a salary cap hit of $4.5 million. Chicago can send Zaitsev to another team before the March 3 trade deadline or any time over the next year.UP NEXTBlackhawks: The second game of a four-game trip is Saturday in San Jose.Stars: At Vegas on Saturday, which will be just the second game in a span of a week.___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/2/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819122,"More bodies found in China mine collapse, 48 remain missing","ALXA LEAGUE, China (AP) — Rescuers with backhoes and bulldozers dug through tons of earth and rubble Thursday for 48 people missing after a landslide buried an open-pit mine in northern China. State broadcaster CCTV reported that the confirmed death toll in the disaster rose to five.

            Conditions in the area remain dangerous, and the search had to be suspended for several hours because of a second landslide at the gigantic facility in Inner Mongolia’s Alxa League. 

            On Thursday afternoon, more than a dozen bulldozers, trucks, SUVs and fire engines were seen passing through a remote police checkpoint about 25 kilometers (15 miles) southwest of the mine.











            Nearly all personnel were stopped by police and checked for entry approvals before being allowed to proceed along the road leading to the mine.

            A police officer said only those with government approval would be allowed access to the area. She said people living close to the mine had been sent to stay in a nearby town. 

            Security was also tight at another checkpoint in the neighboring region of Ningxia, 15 kilometers (9 miles) east of the mine, with dozens of officers inspecting every vehicle that sought to pass in either direction. 

            Cranes and other pieces of heavy equipment could be seen, along with covered trucks. It was unclear what the trucks were carrying. 

            Rescuers used heavy digging equipment and cameras that could snake down into the debris, along with thermal imagers and equipment to detect vital signs, Chang Zhigang, the head of the rescue operation, told reporters Thursday. 

            Crews were using extreme caution to avoid more secondary disasters, Chang said. 

            “We will continue to increase the rescue force, race against time, and do our best to search and rescue the lives of every trapped person,"" he said. 

            Police are investigating the cause of the collapse and some people have been detained, Chang said. 

            “We will publicize the result of the investigation in due course,"" he said.

            The initial cave-in of one of the pit’s walls occurred at about 1 p.m. Wednesday, burying people and mining trucks below in tons of rocks and sand. It was followed about five hours later by the additional landslide, forcing the work suspension.

            The official Xinhua News Agency said about 900 rescuers with heavy equipment were on the scene and they had resumed the search by Thursday morning.

            Chinese President Xi Jinping called for “all-out efforts in search and rescue” and for “ensuring the safety of people’s lives and property and maintaining overall social stability.”

            Images of the collapse distributed by CCTV showed a massive wall of debris rushing down a slope onto people and vehicles below.

            The company running the mine, Inner Mongolia Xinjing Coal Industry Co. Ltd., was fined last year for multiple safety violations including insecure routes into and out of the pit, unsafe storage of volatile materials and a lack of training for its safety staff, according to the news website The Paper.

            Inner Mongolia is a key region for mining of coal and various minerals and rare earths that critics say has ravaged the region's landscape of mountains, grassy steppes and deserts.

            China overwhelmingly relies on coal for power generation but has tried to reduce the number of deadly mine accidents through a greater emphasis on safety and the closure of smaller operations that lacked necessary equipment.

            It has recorded a slew of deadly industrial and construction accidents in recent months as a result of poor safety training and regulation, official corruption and a tendency to cut corners by companies seeking to make profits. 

            Despite those high-profile incidents, the overall number of industrial accidents fell by 27% in 2022, when much of China’s economy was shut down under its “zero COVID” policy, from the previous year, the Ministry of Emergency Management announced last month. The number of deaths in the accidents also fell 23.6%, the ministry said.ALXA LEAGUE, China (AP) — Rescuers with backhoes and bulldozers dug through tons of earth and rubble Thursday for 48 people missing after a landslide buried an open-pit mine in northern China.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819123,Coping with concussions: long road to recovery for some,"BRISBANE, Australia (AP) — Vivienne Gray doesn’t fit the same profile as former or current professional athletes forced to live with the ongoing effects of concussions.

            The 33-year-old cardiac care nurse has been attempting to cope with the side effects of a concussion sustained during a collision with an opposing player in an inline hockey game nearly two years ago.

            She fell and hit her head on concrete and doesn’t remember being knocked out from the collision -- although a video showed she was unconscious. A day later she started feeling nauseous and had “weird” and incapacitating headaches that wouldn’t go away.











            Five days later she saw her doctor, and that’s when potential brain damage from the hockey collision became apparent.

            As a nurse, she often witnessed patients doing so-called higher cognitive tests, like counting backwards from 100 in multiples of seven or reciting the months of the year backwards.

            As a healthy nurse, she had always done the tests along with the patients, and passed with flying colors.

            “But I knew something was amiss when my doctor asked me to do the same,” Gray said in an interview with The Associated Press. “I didn’t fare well at all. I didn’t even make it back to October.”

            Gray's doctor is Nicole Higgins, who is also president of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners. This week her group warned government and sporting bodies in Australia that they must do more to limit the long-term impacts of concussions and repeated head trauma.

            The group has submitted a report to an Australian Senate inquiry into concussions and head trauma in contact sports. It's more aimed at the grass-roots level that GPs often have to deal with, like Gray's case.

            Funding for more research is a key part of the report.

            “We are learning more and more about the management of prolonged concussion symptoms, such as post-concussion syndrome and suspected chronic traumatic encephalopathy which many people may recognize from an increasing number of concerning media reports,"" Higgins said

            In Australia, those reports included the death of star Australian rules football player and coach Danny Frawley. Last year, a Victoria state coroner recommended that Australian Football League players be encouraged to donate their brains post-mortem to science to help further the understanding of CTE, a degenerative brain disease found in people with a history of repetitive brain trauma.

            Frawley, who'd been suffering from anxiety and depression, died at the age of 56 in a car crash in 2019 and a post-mortem examination revealed he had CTE, which can only be diagnosed by autopsy.

            “CTE must be taken extremely seriously, and it isn’t just something that we need to worry about in adult sport, damage to the brain can happen at an early age whenever there are repeated knocks to the head,"" Higgins says.

            The effects of concussions on athletes in professional contact sports is well-documented. Boston University CTE Center has done studies which show that more than 300 National Football League players have developed chronic traumatic encephalopathy. 

            “My job as a GP is to prevent and pick up any more complicated issues down the track,"" Higgins says in an interview with the AP. “There is no such thing as ‘it's just a little knock.'"" She said someone with even an apparent minor injury can have more complex reactions in the future.

            Many professional sporting codes have allocated resources to illustrate the dangers of concussions and their long-term effects, including the NFL, World Rugby and England Rugby.

            Higgins has a son and two daughters who play Australian rules football and netball and a husband who coaches and has played Aussie rules. So she's spent many afternoons and evenings on the sidelines watching young athletes in action.

            “As a GP and a parent of children who loves contact sport, I can tell you that we certainly don’t want kids and adults walking away from contact sport and sitting on the couch,"" Higgins says. ""This must be taken seriously.”

            Gray, who lives in the Queensland state regional city of Mackay, where Higgins is also based, is still struggling with her illness.

            She still has difficulty multitasking — walking and talking, eating and conversing, singing and reading music. She has what she calls “fatigue and malaise"" and “decreased lack of executive functions — self control, emotional control, task initiation, working memory . . . planning and time management.""

            “It’s affected my ability to work, run errands, participate in hobbies, socialize and my relationships with friends and family — who are very supportive and caring,"" Gray adds.

            She began a graduated return to work in January 2022 but the six hours she had planned to work every day “broke my brain” and she realized she had pushed too hard to return to work.

            “I got to the stage where I realized I was burning out, and I had overdone it,” she said.

            Now she works three days a week for four hours a day and has what she calls a “multi-disciplinary approach” with her treatment.

            “GP-directed care, psychiatrist, physiotherapy, massage, chiropractor, behavioral optometrist . . . and regular psychology reviews,"" she says. She formerly saw a neurologist and occupational therapist.

            More research, like the GP group is recommending, will help determine what works and what doesn't.

            “More light is being shed on it because with everyone being so different, there is no gold standard for treatment,” Gray says. “My doctors have said I’m doing all the right things to aid my recovery. The length of recovery time is uncertain . . . it will be slow and will be seen with time.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819125,Asia stocks mixed after Wall St breaks losing streak,"BANGKOK (AP) — Shares in Asia were mixed Friday after Wall Street broke its longest losing streak since December with a modest rally led by tech stocks. 

            Benchmarks rose in Tokyo and Sydney but fell in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Seoul. Oil prices rose while U.S. futures edged lower.

            Japan reported its core consumer price index, excluding volatile fresh foods, rose the most in 41 years in January. But the nominee to head its central bank, economist Kazuo Ueda, told lawmakers he favors keeping Japan’s benchmark interest rate near zero to ensure stable growth. 











            Ueda is expected to succeed BOJ Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda when he steps down in April after two 5-year terms marked by unprecedented easing. The change of leadership has prompted speculation about a possible change in the ultra-lax monetary stance, though Ueda sought to dispel such expectations. 

            “Time is needed before the effects of monetary policy kick in,” Ueda told Parliament, noting the price rises are peaking. 

            Wages in Japan have failed to keep pace with price increases, and worries over a potential global recession have left the BOJ wary of altering course. 

            Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index added 1.1% to 27,390.09 and the S&P/ASX 200 in Australia gained 0.3% to to 7,303.50. India's Sensex was up 0.3% at 59,814.70. 

            In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index lost 1.4% to 20,063.48 while the Shanghai Composite index gave up 0.7% to 3,264.58. South Korea's Kospi lost 0.7% to 2,423.56. Bangkok and Taiwan also declined. 

            On Thursday, the S&P 500 rose 0.5% for its first gain in five days, closing at 4,012.32. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.3% to 33,153,91, and the Nasdaq composite surged 0.7% to 11,590.40.

            Tech stocks helped lead the way after Nvidia reported better results for the latest quarter than expected. Its shares jumped 14% after it also gave a forecast for upcoming revenue that topped some analysts’ expectations. It cited recovering strength in video gaming and demand for artificial intelligence products. 

            Tech and high-growth stocks have struggled recently because of worries about rising interest rates. They’re seen as some of the most vulnerable as the Federal Reserve jacks rates higher in hopes of stamping out inflation.

            High rates hurt prices for investments, particularly those seen as the riskiest, most expensive or whose big growth is furthest out in the future. They also raise the risk of a recession because they slow the economy.

            A lengthening list of reports have shown the U.S. economy is in stronger shape than expected, raising hopes a recession can be avoided. But that's also forced Wall Street to raise its forecasts for how high the Fed will take interest rates and how long it will keep them there. 

            Fewer workers applied for unemployment benefits last week than expected, the latest indication the job market remains resilient. A separate report said economic growth was likely a touch weaker in the last three months of 2022 than earlier estimated. But the U.S. economy still grew at a 2.7% annual rate. 

            Wall Street’s heightened expectations for rates and the Fed have been most evident in the bond market, where Treasury yields have shot higher this month. They eased a bit on Thursday, taking some of the pressure off stocks. 

            The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which helps set rates for mortgages and other important loans, dipped to 3.86% early Friday from 3.93% late Wednesday. Earlier this week, it topped 3.95%, approaching its highest level since November.

            On the losing end of Wall Street was Moderna, whose shares slid 6.7% after it reported its fourth-quarter profit tumbled 70% as COVID-19 vaccine sales fell and the drugmaker caught up on a royalty payment.

            Domino's Pizza dropped 11.7% despite reporting stronger profit than expected and Lordstown Motors tumbled 11.4% to $1.09 after it said it's temporarily halting production and deliveries of its Endurance electric pickup due to performance and quality issues with certain components. 

            In other trading Friday, U.S. benchmark crude oil gained 67 cents to $76.06 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 

            Brent crude, the pricing basis for international trading, picked up 67 cents to $82.62 per barrel. 

            The U.S. dollar slipped to 134.68 Japanese yen from 134.70 yen. The euro rose to $1.0600 from $1.0596.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819126,Raimondo seeks to rally US behind $52 billion chip program,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo on Thursday called on the country to unite around a $52 billion effort to restore the U.S. as the world leader in advanced computer chips, saying it will require training of tens of thousands of workers.

            “The research, innovation and manufacturing sparked by this law will enable us to be the technological superpower, securing our economic and national security future for the next generation,” Raimondo said in a speech at Georgetown University.

            The government sees the funding as a launching pad to create two major semiconductor clusters inside the U.S. featuring a network of factories, research laboratories and other infrastructure.











            But fulfilling that vision will be a multi-year challenge that requires job training and figuring out scientific breakthroughs to lower the cost of producing advanced chips. There is a level of cooperation that is needed among the federal government, state governments, local officials, CEOs, universities and school districts — the kind of joint effort that could be challenging in an era of divided politics.

            The Biden administration is hopeful it can surmount political hurdles as Democrats and Republicans alike back the initiative.

            President Joe Biden signed the CHIPS and Science Act into law last August on the promise that it would spur factory groundbreakings. It is also designed to ensure a steady supply of the chips needed for autos, appliances, electronics, toys, toothbrushes and weapons systems. 

            The U.S. — despite being the birthplace of chips — has ceded ground to producers in South Korea and Taiwan, creating an economic and national security challenge if shipping lanes are blocked.

            Chips are integrated circuits that are embedded in a semiconductor, a material — notably silicon — that can manage the flow of electric current. The terms “chip” and “semiconductor” are often used interchangeably.

            Starting next week, the application process will begin for semiconductor firms seeking to qualify for $39 billion in government backing to help fund their expansion. The administration expects the $39 billion for factories will generate 10 times that, at a minimum, in private-sector investment. 

            The potential benefits come from the spillover effects of computer chip production jobs that typically pay over $100,000, leading to additional economic activity and business formation. That has Raimondo saying that colleges and universities must triple the number of graduates in semiconductor-related fields, otherwise there will be a shortage of workers.

            “This is math, people, this isn't a political agenda,” Raimondo said in her speech.

            The new law also contains $11 billion to fund a research partnership between universities, companies and national laboratories — all with the mission of increasing a chip’s processing power and lowering the cost of semiconductors so that there are buyers in a global market.

            “We have to bring down the cost — big time — which means innovation, innovation, innovation,” Raimondo told The Associated Press in an interview.

            To succeed, she said, the U.S. needs a whole-of-society effort. It’s the kind of mobilization akin to World War II or the space race that grandparents talk about to younger generations, a make-or-break moment for the nation with the world’s largest economy and military.

            “There have been times in history,” Raimondo said in the interview, “where a president used the pursuit of a goal, a technological goal, like putting a man on the moon, like leading the world in nuclear technology, to catalyze the whole country to do their part in achieving that goal.”

            Critics note that the real work is with administering the law and monitoring how the funds are used, warning that simply spending money does not guarantee the desired results and could create economic distortions.

            “The CHIPS Act is a work in progress to say the least,” said Anthony Kim, a research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation. “Spending more is not and cannot be a solution, particularly in the current economy environment where inflationary pressures are still abundant.”

            The promise of government support is spurring construction plans, though it’s still early in a process that will take years. Major chip companies such as TSMC, Intel, Micron, IBM and others have so far committed to roughly $200 billion for investments in new plants, according to the White House. Last week, Texas Instruments announced an $11 billion investment to expand its semiconductor production in Utah.

            The moves are long-term in nature. There is a relative glut of chips available right now, after a shortage as the world economy began to emerge from the coronavirus pandemic in 2021.WASHINGTON (AP) — Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo on Thursday called on the country to unite around a $52 billion effort to restore the U.S. as the world leader in advanced computer chips, saying it will require training of tens of thousands of workers.“The research, innovation and manufacturing sparked by this law will enable us to be the technological superpower, securing our economic and national security future for the next generation,” Raimondo said in a speech at Georgetown University.The government sees the funding as a launching pad to create two major semiconductor clusters inside the U.S. featuring a network of factories, research laboratories and other infrastructure.But fulfilling that vision will be a multi-year challenge that requires job training and figuring out scientific breakthroughs to lower the cost of producing advanced chips. There is a level of cooperation that is needed among the federal government, state governments, local officials, CEOs, universities and school districts — the kind of joint effort that could be challenging in an era of divided politics.The Biden administration is hopeful it can surmount political hurdles as Democrats and Republicans alike back the initiative.President Joe Biden signed the CHIPS and Science Act into law last August on the promise that it would spur factory groundbreakings.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819127,"Flames rally for 6-3 win, end Coyotes' points streak at 9","TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) — Jakob Pelletier and Walker Duehr scored goals 25 seconds apart in the third period and the Calgary Flames rallied to beat the Arizona Coyotes 6-3 on Wednesday night.

            Calgary's Mikael Backlund scored with 3:19 left to cap the scoring. It was his 13th of the season and was the Flames' third power-play tally of the night.

            Milan Lucic, Elias Lindholm and Tyler Toffoli also scored for the Flames, who opened a three-game swing as they chase the top eight in the Western Conference playoff race. It was their first time playing at Mullett Arena. They outshot the Coyotes 52-14.











            Lindholm, who also had an assist, reached 500 career points.

            “Our season is on the line, and we played a solid game,"" Lindholm said. ""Stuck with it and got the results.”

            Calgary went up 4-3 with 15:07 left on Pelletier’s goal after Arizona’s Matias Maccelli had been penalized for tripping. Just 26 seconds later, Duehr made it 5-3.

            Pelletier's winner was his second career goal — the 2019 first-round pick played in just his 12th NHL game. “It’s time for me to step up and score goals,"" he said. 

            Duehr was recalled from the Calgary Wranglers of the American Hockey League on Tuesday and contributed a goal and an assist.

            “We needed the young guys,” Flames coach Darryl Sutter said. “Walker's pace and his speed makes a difference to our team.”

            Nick Schmaltz, Clayton Keller and Maccelli scored goals for the Coyotes, who saw their nine-game points streak (5-0-4) come to an end. It had been the longest such streak running in the NHL and only six have been longer in the NHL this season.

            “I think they were desperate, faster and they played a better game than us,” Coyotes coach Andre Tourigny said.

            Calgary dominated the shots on goal, with an 18-3 edge after the first period. But the only goal of the period was scored by Lucic, from in close on a nice feed from Duehr.

            Karol Vejmelka managed to keep the Flames off the board the remainder of the period. In the first minute of the second period, the Flames’ Mikael Backlund went off for tripping, the first penalty assessed in the game. Then 29 seconds later, Schmaltz scored his 16th goal on a one-timer from Keller’s cross-ice pass. Juuso Valimaki also assisted on the goal at 1:11.

            Keller was penalized for tripping at 7:09 of the second. But Vejmelka and the Coyotes killed the penalty, and Keller returned to the ice and scored his 24th of the season, unassisted, at 9:31.

            Arizona made it 3-1 at 11:06 when Maccelli beat Dan Vlagar on the short side for his fourth goal, also unassisted. At that point the Coyotes were being outshot 30-8.

            The lead didn’t last long. Arizona was assessed a bench penalty during a line change and 7 seconds into the Calgary power play, Lindholm put home a rebound off Toffoli’s shot at 12:58. Toffoli tied it 1:02 later with a high shot from the blue line that beat Vejmelka for his 24th goal of the season. Lindholm assisted on that goal.

            CONGRATS

            Calgary D Chris Tanev played in his 700th NHL game Wednesday. Tanev, who broke in with Vancouver in 2011, ranks fourth among undrafted players in career games. Toronto’s Mark Giordano (1,081) leads that list.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819142,Washington sees raft of pro-Taiwan legislation after congressmen visit Taipei,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Following a recent bipartisan congressional delegation from Washington to Taipei, several new pro-Taiwan bills have been introduced in Congress.

Most recently, House Representative Tony Gonzales, who was in Taiwan this week, introduced H.R.1127 on Feb. 21, which calls for greater cooperation on cybersecurity between Taiwan and Washington. Meanwhile, in the U.S. Senate, two separate pro-Taiwan bills were introduced by Rick Scott of Florida.Scott introduced bills S.447 and S.481 on Feb. 16. The first calls for the president to use the U.S. military to secure and defend Taiwan against armed attack from China. It so far does not have any cosponsors listed.The second is a bill to impose sanctions on China as a means of deterring aggression against Taiwan. It has been co-sponsored by Kevin Kramer of Wisconsin.The house bill from Gonzales, a representative from Texas, calls for the Department of Homeland Security to cooperate with Taiwan to “strengthen preparedness against cyber threats and enhance capabilities in cybersecurity.” The previous week, Gonzalez also introduced a new bill that would forbid foreign adversaries like China from purchasing land near military bases or sensitive areas.

This week, Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin also made a trip to Taiwan. He spoke to the Washington Post about cross-strait issues and emphasized the need for Congress to show more support for Taipei. Gallagher says that Washington must provide Taiwan with sufficient arms and defensive capability to deter any attack by China.",2023/2/23,924,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819166,R. Kelly avoids lengthy add-on to 30-year prison sentence,"CHICAGO (AP) — A federal judge on Thursday rejected a call from prosecutors to keep R. Kelly behind bars until he is 100, instead telling the Grammy Award-winning R&B singer he would serve all but one of his 20 years on child sex convictions simultaneously with a previous sentence. 

            Handed down in a courtroom in Kelly's hometown of Chicago, the sentence means Kelly could make it out of prison alive, when he is about 80. Prosecutors had asked Judge Harry Leinenweber to sentence him to 25 years — and to not let him begin serving those until after he completed the first 30-year sentence, imposed on him last year in New York for federal racketeering and sex trafficking convictions.

            “The nature of this offense is … horrific,” Leinenweber said in explaining the 20-year sentence. He noted that Kelly's sexual abuse victims would suffer from his crimes for the rest of their lives. 











            At the same time, he accepted defense arguments that Kelly might not even make it to 80, so handing him a consecutive lengthy sentence, rather than allowing him to serve all but one year of it simultaneously, didn't make much sense. 

            “He has a life expectancy of not a hell of a lot more,” the judge said. “He is 56 years of age.” 

            Kelly's defense lawyer celebrated the ruling as a victory, and some of the singer's fans could be heard cheering outside the courtroom.

            Kelly remained still, his eyes downcast, as Leinenweber explained what was at times a hard-to-follow sentence. He did seem to show some emotion when a representative read a statement written by “Jane,” one of his accusers and a key prosecution witness.

            “I was brainwashed by Robert and a sex slave,” Jane’s statement said. “It almost killed me.”

            Kelly did not make a statement in court prior to the sentencing decision, heeding the advice of his lawyer, Jennifer Bonjean, to stay quiet while they appeal both his Chicago and New York convictions. 

            “It’s the right outcome,” Bonjean said of the sentence after the hearing ended. ""The judge was reasonable. He, I think, took into account both sides and ultimately was fair.”

            The U.S. Attorney in Chicago, John Lausch, conceded that prosecutors were disappointed Kelly didn’t receive more consecutive prison time. But he added, “Twenty years is a significant sentence, and we are happy that that was imposed in this case.""

            The judge said at the outset of Thursday's hearing that he did not accept the government’s contention that Kelly used fear to woo underage girls for sex, a determination that was important in deciding whether to extend Kelly's current term significantly.

            “The (government’s) whole theory of grooming, was sort of the opposite of fear of bodily harm,” the judge told the court. “It was the fear of lost love, lost affections (from Kelly)'. … It just doesn’t seem to me that it rises to the fear of bodily harm.”

            Two of Kelly's accusers asked the judge Thursday to punish him harshly. 

            “When your virginity is taken by a pedophile at 14 … your life is never your own,” Jane’s statement read. 

            Another accuser, who used the pseudonym “Nia,” addressed Kelly directly in court. Speaking forcefully as her voice quivered, Nia said Kelly would repeatedly point out her alleged faults while he abused her. 

            “Now you are here … because there is something wrong with you,” she said. “No longer will you be able to harm children.”

            Jurors in Chicago convicted Kelly last year on six of 13 counts: three of producing child porn and three of enticement of minors for sex. Prosecutors did not get a conviction on the marquee charge: that Kelly and his then-business manager successfully rigged his state child pornography trial in 2008.

            Kelly rose from poverty in Chicago to become one of the world’s biggest R&B stars. Known for his smash hit “I Believe I Can Fly” and for sex-infused songs such as “Bump n’ Grind,” he sold millions of albums even after allegations about his abuse of girls began circulating publicly in the 1990s. 

            Prosecutors had previously described Kelly as “a serial sexual predator” who used his fame and wealth to reel in, sexually abuse and then discard star-struck fans.

            At Thursday's hearing, U.S. Assistant Attorney Jeannice Appenteng urged the judge to keep Kelly in prison “for the rest of his life.”

            Kelly’s abuse of children was especially appalling, she said, because he “memorialized” his abuse by filming victims, including Jane. Appenteng told the court Kelly “used Jane as a sex prop, a thing” for producing pornographic videos.

            Bonjean has said repeatedly that the government singled out her client because he is a superstar and she previously accused prosecutors of offering an “embellished narrative” to get the judge to join what she called the government’s “bloodthirsty campaign to make Kelly a symbol of the #MeToo movement.” 

            She echoed that theme Thursday in calling the request for a 25-year consecutive sentence “overkill.”

            The singer has suffered enough, including financially, Bonjean said. She said his worth once approached $1 billion, but that he “is now destitute.” 

            Just before Kelly was taken back to detention Thursday, Bonjean requested that he not be placed on suicide watch because constant checks by guards “is in and of itself cruel” and “creates mental health issues.""

            “He was expecting this,” she told the judge. “Mr. Kelly … is not suicidal.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819167,"Ukraine first lady cites rights violations, urges tribunal","UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Ukraine’s first lady Olena Zelenska gave a video tour of human rights violations in the country following Russia’s invasion almost a year ago, telling a U.N. meeting Wednesday: “We have the right to live free, not to be killed or tortured.” 

            She showed destruction in the eastern frontline city of Bakhmut, which Russia is trying to capture, where shelling is killing civilians and water is scarce; the mass graves of Ukrainians left behind after Russian occupiers left the city of Izium; the Kramatorsk train station, which was hit by a missile killing 50 people and wounding dozens more trying to flee the war; and many other examples.

            At a meeting on “Gross Human Rights Violations Due To The Aggression Against Ukraine” organized by the Kyiv government, Zelenska also pointed to ill-treated emaciated Ukrainian prisoners of war, and the thousands of children Russia has taken from Ukraine and the reported adoption of some of them by Russian families.











            “We are fighting for human rights,” she said, speaking virtually. “We are fighting for what unites us, the right to freedom, life, not to get tortured and to live freely.”

            The wife of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed that Ukraine’s victory in the war will mean the victory of human rights over “lawlessness, torture and destruction.”

            She called on the United Nations to establish a special tribunal to prosecute crimes of Russian aggression, stressing that “it is not only us who need that, we need that for everyone.” 

             “Justice for Ukraine is justice for the entire world,"" Zelenska said.

            International pressure has been mounting for a special tribunal to be established to prosecute the crime of aggression. The European Union’s legislature passed a non-binding resolution in January calling on the 27-nation bloc to work “in close cooperation with Ukraine to seek and build political support in the U.N. General Assembly and other international forums ... for creating the special tribunal for the crime of aggression against Ukraine.”

            The International Criminal Court, which has a mandate to prosecute war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide, has opened an investigation into crimes committed in Ukraine. But it does not have jurisdiction to prosecute Russia’s leaders for aggression.

            Netherlands Foreign Minister Wopke Hoeksta told the meeting that Russia’s crimes are piling up a year after its Feb. 24, 2022 invasion, pointing to “child abductions, sexual violence, torture, the shelling of schools, hospitals and houses, the destruction of entire neighborhoods.”

            He said the Netherlands is taking a leading role in ensuring justice for the people of Ukraine and the quest for accountability which requires “watertight evidence.”

            Hoeksta announced that the Netherlands is sending two more forensic investigation missions to Ukraine to collect evidence and urged all countries that are parties to the International Criminal Court to contribute to this effort.

            He said the Netherlands also strongly supports establishment of an International Center for the Prosecution of the Crime of Aggression “to collect evidence that can be used to eventually try Russian leadership.” He said it should be based in The Hague, the Dutch city that is also the headquarters of the ICC and the International Court of Justice, the U.N.’s highest court.

            “We must do all we can to prevent further injustice,” Hoeksta said. “There can never be peace in a world where crime and brute force prevails over justice.”UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Ukraine’s first lady Olena Zelenska gave a video tour of human rights violations in the country following Russia’s invasion almost a year ago, telling a U.N. meeting Wednesday: “We have the right to live free, not to be killed or tortured.”She showed destruction in the eastern frontline city of Bakhmut, which Russia is trying to capture, where shelling is killing civilians and water is scarce; the mass graves of Ukrainians left behind after Russian occupiers left the city of Izium; the Kramatorsk train station, which was hit by a missile killing 50 people and wounding dozens more trying to flee the war; and many other examples.At a meeting on “Gross Human Rights Violations Due To The Aggression Against Ukraine” organized by the Kyiv government, Zelenska also pointed to ill-treated emaciated Ukrainian prisoners of war, and the thousands of children Russia has taken from Ukraine and the reported adoption of some of them by Russian families.“We are fighting for human rights,” she said, speaking virtually. “We are fighting for what unites us, the right to freedom, life, not to get tortured and to live freely.”The wife of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed that Ukraine’s victory in the war will mean the victory of human rights over “lawlessness, torture and destruction.”She called on the United Nations to establish a special tribunal to prosecute crimes of Russian aggression, stressing that “it is not only us who need that, we need that for everyone.”“Justice for Ukraine is justice for the entire world,"" Zelenska said.International pressure has been mounting for a special tribunal to be established to prosecute the crime of aggression.

As for people who have already contracted COVID, they are not eligible for vaccination until more than three months (84 days) from the date they were diagnosed with the virus.If a person has already received two vaccine doses, the third dose must not be administered until three months after receiving the most recent jab. The shot received by people who have already opted for the BA.5-adapted bivalent vaccine as of Jan. 1 will be added to their annual COVID vaccination tally.March 6 has been set as the starting date due to the many closures during the 228 Memorial Day holiday. In addition, March has been selected to give local governments time to arrange contracted medical institutions to provide vaccination services, and set up community vaccination stations to improve inoculation accessibility.The remaining doses of vaccines include:For information about where COVID vaccinations are being offered, visit the CDC page of participating institutions.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819189,Russia's war on Ukraine in numbers,"February 24 marks one year since Russia began its invasion of Ukraine. Despite counter-advances by the Ukrainian army, substantial parts of eastern Ukraine remain occupied by Russian troops. Most recently, on January 19, 2023, Ukrainian forces withdrew from the embattled city of Soledar in the Donbas region, which has since been under Russian control again.According to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), the war has led to the second-largest displacement crisis in the world. So far, 6.3 million Ukrainians have found refuge in Europe. Within the country, another 6.6 million people are internally displaced.According to the UN, many people are also being deported to Russia or are being forced to emigrate there, especially from the areas of eastern Ukraine. This explains the high number of refugees in Russia. Some of them have already tried to continue on to Europe from Russia.According to the UNHCR, the humanitarian situation in Ukraine has ""deteriorated rapidly."" Around 40% of the population is now dependent on humanitarian aid. The economic situation is also catastrophic. According to the World Bank and the Ukrainian Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food, the country's gross domestic product (GDP) shrank by 35% in 2022. Around 60% of the population now lives on the poverty line. Russia's attacks have destroyed about €130 billion ($139 billion) worth of Ukrainian infrastructure.In contrast to Ukraine, the situation in Russia is less critical than expected, as the economy has not suffered as much in comparison. But with additional EU sanctions passed against Russia in February of this year, experts believe existing sanctions will finally begin to bite.Predictions for Russia's economic future are very different: while the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development assumes the Russian economy will shrink by 5.6% this year, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasts minimal growth of 0.3%.After a surge in energy prices in March 2022, Russia's income from oil and gas initially jumped sharply and then fell continuously. The income from energy exports is now back at the pre-war level of December 2021.In view of falling gas and oil prices, in combination with declining demand, especially from the EU, and in light of stagnant consumption by China, Russia's energy export revenues will likely decline further.Since the beginning of the invasion, Ukraine has received billions in military, humanitarian, and financial aid. With more than €70 billion in funds, the US tops the list of donor countries.The EU and its member states have mobilized over €50 billion, with Germany being one of the largest arms suppliers to Ukraine. Military support valued at around €2.2 billion is planned for 2023.In addition, NATO has increased its military presence on its eastern flank. So-called multinational battlegroups have been deployed to the Baltic states, and airspace surveillance in the region has been beefed up.Many expected a global food crisis following the invasion, but so far, the worst-case scenario has been avoided. According to the Ukrainian and US Departments of Agriculture, global wheat production will increase from 778 million tons in 2021/2022 to 783 million tons in 2022/2023.The price of wheat, which peaked at over €430 per ton after the Russian invasion in May 2022, has since fallen back to just under €300. That is near price levels from before the invasion, when wheat was traded for €275 per ton.The production losses in Ukraine — still one of the leading wheat producers worldwide — are currently compensated by other countries. Australia and Russia in particular have increased their production. According to the Russian news agency Tass, the increase is due to ""the incorporation of the four Ukrainian territories"" under Russian control. At 102 million tons, the Russian Ministry of Agriculture is also assuming a much better harvest than the US Department of Agriculture estimates.This article was translated from German.",2023/2/23,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819197,Colorado Springs gay club shooter’s case heads to trial,"COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) — A shooter seemed to be driven by bias against the LGBTQ community in plotting an attack at a gay nightclub in Colorado Springs, killing five and wounding 17 others, a judge acknowledged Thursday in finding that prosecutors showed enough evidence for trial on murder and ha te crime charges.

            Prosecutors and defense attorneys had argued Wednesday over whether Anderson Lee Adlrich’s actions were a hate crime. Aldrich, who is nonbinary and uses they and them pronouns, had visited Club Q at least six times in the years before the attack, witnesses testified. The venue has long been a sanctuary for the LGBTQ community in the mostly conservative city. 

            District Attorney Michael Allen told the judge that the evidence showed that Aldrich had a ""distaste for LGBTQ,"" pointing to an online message of a rifle scope over a gay pride parade picture and use of gay slurs against others and while online gaming. Aldrich was forced to go to the club by their mother, he said, while arguing the attack was inspired by a “neo-Nazi white supremacist” shooting training video posted on a website Aldrich ran. 











            “We presented evidence regarding the defendant’s aversion to the LGBTQ community, evidence related to the defendant’s mother forcing him to go to a club against his will and sort of forced that culture on him,” said Allen, who consistently used male pronouns for Aldrich. 

            Allen said at a news conference that using the male pronoun was “unintentional."" But asked later whether he believed Aldrich was nonbinary, Allen said: “My belief has nothing to do with that so I am going to refrain. Again you can jump to your own conclusions as far as that goes."" 

            Aldrich’s lawyers pushed back against the notion that the crime was hate-motivated by arguing that Aldrich was drugged up on cocaine and had taken multiple tablets of the anti-anxiety drug Xanax and the stimulant Adderall the night of the shooting. 

            The defense also brought up Aldrich’s mental health for the first time, showing photographs of pill bottles for drugs that Aldrich had been prescribed to treat mental illness, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. 

            Defense attorney Joseph Archambault told the judge that what happened was “senseless, it was awful and it was tragic” but noted that Aldrich expressed remorse. He noted that most mass shooters who target a specific group post manifestos. That, he stressed, was not what Aldrich had done.

            “It doesn’t excuse it. It’s not a defense. It doesn’t change anything. But it is categorically different than the people who target a group and are unapologetic about it later,” Archambault said. 

            Judge Michael McHenry didn’t specifically address the hate crime debate, saying only that there was sufficient evidence for the case to move toward trial. 

            Appearing in the courtroom in an orange jumpsuit, hands and ankles shackled, Aldrich had no visible reaction to the ruling after crying at times during the testimony. The 22-year-old faces more than 300 charges including murder and bias-motivated crimes. 

            Judge McHenry also ordered Aldrich to continue to be held without bond. McHenry agreed to delay the arraignment until May, anticipating that the defense will try to hire experts to see if Aldrich would qualify to enter a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity. However, he warned Aldrich’s attorneys that being under the influence of illegal drugs or alcohol can not be considered the cause of insanity. Allen said it was premature to discuss the potential for such a plea. 

            No trial date has been set. 

            Several victims’ families filed out of the court afterward without talking and met behind closed doors with prosecutors at their office across the street. 

            McHenry had to decide only whether prosecutors have shown during this week's hearing that there is probable cause that Aldrich committed the crimes they are charged with in order for the case to move ahead to a trial. At a trial, prosecutors are held to a higher standard and must prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt to convince jurors to convict defendants. 

            Unlike other crimes, hate crime charges require prosecutors to present evidence of a motive — that Aldrich was driven by bias, either wholly or in part.

            Although Aldrich identifies as nonbinary, someone who is a member of a protected group such as the LGBTQ community can still be charged with a hate crime for targeting peers. Hate crime laws are focused on the victims, not the perpetrator. 

            The hearing also revealed that Aldrich might be gay, something not previously mentioned by prosecutors or defense attorneys. Aldrich told one of the patrons who helped stop the attack, “My mom will not accept me because I’m gay.” Aldrich then added, “You’re all the same,” the lead detective in the shooting, Rebecca Joines, testified during cross examination. 

            Joines also testified about a neo-Nazi video, which featured attacks on synagogues and mosques abroad, including on two mosques in New Zealand in 2019. It was posted on a website that Aldrich administered. Joines said that Aldrich had not created the video, which has been posted by many others online, but that she believed they were seeking to emulate it with the attack.

            Exhibits from the hearing also were released Thursday, including photos of a bullet riddled rainbow-colored shooting target that was found in the room of Aldrich’s mother and a note found in the apartment where Aldrich also lived.

            “Please,” the note read, “relieve me of my own fate, I’m drowning in my wake. How long must I wait for you to rid me of this hate.”

            Also released was a receipt that showed that on one of Aldrich’s visits to the club before the shooting, they bought two vodkas and “gayoli fries” from bartender Derrick Rump, who was among those slain. 

            A representative with the federal public defender’s office was in court for the hearing but the office has a policy of not talking to the media. When Allen was asked whether the U.S. attorney’s office was considering charges in the case, he noted that the federal system has the death penalty, although there is a moratorium on executions. Colorado, meanwhile, has abolished the death penalty. Allen referred questions to federal prosecutors, who previously said they don’t comment on whether they are considering pursuing cases.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819217,Kuomintang legacies linger from Taiwan's martial law era,"TAICHUNG (Taiwan News) — Both of Taiwan’s main political parties, the Kuomintang (KMT) and Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) are abnormal political parties. This includes their histories, original purposes, party structures, ideologies, and how they relate to each other.The KMT traces its origins to revolutionary secret societies operating during the late Qing Dynasty (1644 to 1911) whose intent was to expel the foreign Manchu rulers and restore China to native Chinese rule. They played a significant role in overthrowing the Qing Dynasty and eventually were able to more-or-less unify China under their rule, but were constantly plagued by civil war and World War II.Eventually, the KMT, which translated directly means ""Chinese National People’s Party"" (often shortened to Chinese Nationalist Party) turned the Republic of China (ROC) effectively into a one-party state. So much so that they changed the original flag of the ROC to include the party emblem.Being friendly with the Soviet Union at the time, the KMT organized the party along Leninist lines. In spite of this, they eventually expelled communists from the party, largely by executing them.During this period, Taiwan was a colony of the Japanese empire and played no significant role in the events in China or in the KMT.It would be inaccurate to say the KMT had no connection to Taiwan as the original Taiwan People’s Party flag in the 1920s included the KMT emblem and KMT party founder Sun Yat-sen’s (孫逸仙) thinking was influential in intellectual circles. However, it would be accurate to say there was little connection to Taiwan in general.After World War II the Japanese empire was partitioned between the Allied powers, like Germany had American, French, British and Soviet zones. The Taiwan zone was run by the ROC, a situation that theoretically remains to this day, as many countries such as the U.S. hold that Taiwan’s sovereign status remains “undetermined.”After losing the Chinese Civil War, the KMT decamped to Taiwan in 1949, bringing roughly 2 million refugees, the KMT-dominated ROC state and the party itself. Though they make up only roughly 10-15% of the population today, the descendants of these 49er families still hold a disproportionate amount of power in the party.What followed was a long, brutal period of martial law before slowly democratizing in the early 1990s. There are still elements and impacts on the party from the martial law era today.Though it is changing with time, the KMT still has an outsize influence on the military, civil service, diplomatic corps and university administrations. The last report I saw, about two-thirds of former dictator Chiang Kai-shek's (蔣介石) statues have been taken down since the Tsai administration took power, but some government agencies are still dragging their heels out of loyalty to the KMT.The KMT emblem is still on the flag and on the insignia of many government and military agencies and continues to serve as state-funded marketing for the party. Similarly, the money and street names continue to promote KMT figures like Chiang, as well as Sun Yat-sen and his Three Principles of the People.Also during the martial law period and to some extent extending until today, Taiwan in many respects had a command economy, much of it inherited from the Japanese era. The government didn’t just control the power company, phone company, trains and so on, but also products like salt, sugar, tobacco, alcohol, fertilizer and cement.The top positions in those institutions were often packed with the party faithful. Or they were given out as rewards for services to the party and older employees, even after privatization.Incidentally, today’s PX Mart supermarket chain started life by offering cheaper prices and no sales tax to the military, civil servants, teachers and other employees of government entities dominated by the KMT. Today it no longer serves any of those functions, however, and it is doubtful there are many KMT-era holdovers left as it is now a fully privatized entity.Some powerful NGOs are also still strongly associated with the KMT, in spite of formal ties having been cut. These include the National Women’s League (NWL), which was founded by first lady Madame Chiang Kai-shek (宋美齡); and the China Youth Corps (CYC), which started life at the behest of then dictator Chiang Kai-shek as the China Youth Anti-Communist National Salvation Corps.In 2016, the new DPP administration passed the ill-gotten gains act, which stripped the KMT of assets seized by the party from the departing Japanese after WW II or during the martial law era. The NWL and CYC also had assets seized as it was ruled they had directly benefited from KMT martial law asset seizures.That act led to another unusual aspect to the KMT — its weak financial state. When it was billed as the “richest political party in the world,” the KMT would hand out plum party positions to loyalists so they could collect salaries as a reward and, as one political scientist described it, sit around, drink tea and smoke cigarettes.While most or all of those excess employees are gone now, the party was hit hard financially by paying out severance packages and today is still on the hook for an outsized number of pensions. For years the party had to borrow massive sums to stay afloat, though it appears that under current Chair Eric Chu (朱立倫) they have managed to stay out of the red.Another curious legacy of the martial law era is the local KMT patronage factions. In a nutshell, they are local networks that would in the past, and sometimes still today, hand out government jobs, fix problems using the government on behalf of people, dole out government contracts and financial rewards in return for political support.They were formed out of existing Taiwanese elites soon after the KMT arrived. To keep them from growing too powerful, the national KMT controlled by 49er families limited the factions to their city or county, and the KMT ensured there was always more than one of them.To placate the Americans and maintain a veneer of democracy, elections were held at the local level. No new parties were allowed to be formed, but independents could and sometimes did run.They didn’t win often, however, because the factions had control over the local levers of government in most cases, and would buy votes. The factions were very powerful and wealthy locally because at the time they controlled local credit cooperatives, agricultural and irrigation organizations. They also had sway over the bidding process for construction in an era when kickbacks and corruption were the norm.Today, the factions still exist in rural areas of the country, and continue to have some sway. They lost access to credit cooperatives a long time ago and irrigation was recently nationalized, but they can still dominate agricultural associations.The KMT today still has some institutional advantages left over from the martial law era, especially at the local level and in government institutions, but they’re slowly being eroded.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819230,South Sudan's president calls on refugees to return home,"JUBA, South Sudan (AP) — South Sudan’s president has urged the country’s more than 2 million refugees to return home in his first meeting with displaced people since civil war erupted almost a decade ago.

            President Salva Kiir’s appeal on Wednesday came as the country prepares to hold its first elections since gaining independence from Sudan in 2011. South Sudan’s delayed elections are set to take place in December 2024.

            South Sudan is still recovering from the five-year civil war that erupted in late 2013, killed hundreds of thousands of people and ended with a peace agreement in 2018. For a while, fleeing South Sudanese formed the world's largest refugee camp in neighboring Uganda.











            The president’s meeting came two weeks after the visiting Pope Francis met with displaced South Sudanese in the capital, Juba, and appealed for lasting peace.

            “With peace implementation moving towards the final phase where elections will end the transitional period, repatriating our people from the camps in neighboring countries should top our agenda,” Kiir said.

            The president assured people returning to the country of their security, and he appealed to international partners to support the government in reintegrating returnees.

            “For those who will opt to return to their habitual areas of residence, the government will provide security,” Kiir said. Those who cannot return to their home communities will be allocated land in states where displacement camps are located, he said.JUBA, South Sudan (AP) — South Sudan’s president has urged the country’s more than 2 million refugees to return home in his first meeting with displaced people since civil war erupted almost a decade ago.President Salva Kiir’s appeal on Wednesday came as the country prepares to hold its first elections since gaining independence from Sudan in 2011.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819232,"Gaza rockets, Israeli strikes follow deadly West Bank raid","TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Palestinian militants in Gaza launched rockets at southern Israel and Israeli aircraft struck targets in the coastal enclave early Thursday after a gunbattle triggered by an Israeli raid in the occupied West Bank killed 10 Palestinians.

            The bloodshed extends one of the deadliest periods in years in the West Bank, where dozens of Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire since the start of the year. Palestinian attacks on Israelis in 2023 have killed 11 people.

            The Israeli military said Palestinian militants fired six rockets and two anti-aircraft missiles from the Gaza Strip toward the country’s south early Thursday. Air defenses intercepted five of the rockets and one landed in an open field, according to the military. The missiles did not hit their targets. The attacks were not immediately claimed by Palestinian militant groups.











            Israeli aircraft then struck several targets in northern and central Gaza, including a weapons manufacturing site and a military compound belonging to the Hamas militant group that rules the enclave. There were no reports of injuries in Israel or Gaza from the rocket attacks or strikes.

            The violence comes in the first weeks of Israel's new far-right government, which has promised to take a tough line against Palestinians, and as security forces step up arrest raids of wanted militants in the West Bank. Israel says the raids — begun in the wake of a series of deadly Palestinian attacks last spring — are meant to dismantle militant networks and thwart future assaults.

            But the operations have shown few signs of slowing the violence and Wednesday’s resulted in one of the bloodiest battles in nearly a year in the West Bank and east Jerusalem, raising the likelihood of further bloodshed. 

            “We have a clear policy: to strike terror powerfully and to deepen our roots in our land,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a meeting of his Cabinet. “We will settle accounts with whoever harms Israeli citizens.”

            Israeli police stepped up security in sensitive areas on Thursday, while Hamas said its patience was “running out.” Islamic Jihad, another militant group, vowed to retaliate.

            A day after a raid in January on the Jenin refugee camp in the West Bank that killed 10 Palestinians, a Palestinian shot and killed seven people outside a synagogue in east Jerusalem.

            On Thursday, police said security guards at the entrance to a West Bank settlement shot and lightly wounded a woman who police said attempted to stab the guards.

            Among the 10 killed in Wednesday’s raid in Nablus were Palestinian men aged 72 and 61, and a 16-year-old boy, according to health officials. Scores of others were wounded. Various Palestinian militant groups claimed six of the dead as members. There was no immediate word on whether the others belonged to armed groups. Officials also said a 66-year-old man died from tear gas inhalation.

            In response to the raid, a strike was called across the West Bank, and schools, universities and shops all shut down in protest. Schools and universities in Gaza and most shops in east Jerusalem were also closed.

            Israel captured the West Bank, along with the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem, in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians seek those territories for their hoped-for independent state.

            The Israeli military said it entered Nablus, the West Bank’s commercial center and a city known as a militant stronghold, to arrest three militants suspected in previous shooting attacks. The main suspect was wanted in the killing of an Israeli soldier last fall.

            Wednesday's four-hour operation left a broad swath of damage in a centuries-old marketplace in Nablus. In the Old City, shops were riddled with bullets, parked cars were crushed, and blood stained the cement ruins. Furniture from the destroyed home was scattered among mounds of debris.

            The influx of wounded overwhelmed the city’s Najah Hospital, said Ahmad Aswad, the head nurse of the cardiology department.

            In one emotional scene, a medic pronounced a man dead, only to notice the lifeless patient was his father. Elsewhere, an amateur video showed two men, apparently unarmed, being shot as they ran in the street. Military spokesman Lt. Col. Richard Hecht said the armed forces were looking into it.

            As the bodies were paraded through the crowd on stretchers, thousands of people packed the streets, chanting in support of the militants. Masked men fired into the air.

            The fighting comes at a sensitive time, less than two months after Netanyahu’s new hard-line government took office. It presents an early challenge for Netanyahu, who on top of spiraling violence is also facing waves of protests from Israelis against a plan to overhaul the country’s justice system.

            The government is dominated by ultranationalists who have pushed for tougher action against Palestinian militants and vowed to entrench Israeli rule in the occupied West Bank, including by ramping up settlement construction on lands Palestinians seek for their future state. Israeli media have quoted top security officials as expressing concern that the harder line could lead to even more violence as the Muslim holy month of Ramadan approaches.

            About 60 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank and east Jerusalem this year, according to a tally by The Associated Press.

            Last year, nearly 150 Palestinians were killed in those areas, making it the deadliest year there since 2004, according to figures by the Israeli rights group B’Tselem. Some 30 people on the Israeli side were killed in Palestinian attacks.

            Israel says most of those killed were militants.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819233,"Winter storms sow more chaos, shut down much of Portland","PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — Winter storms sowed more chaos across the U.S. on Thursday, shutting down much of Oregon's largest city with almost a foot of snow and paralyzing travel from parts of the Pacific Coast all the way to the northern Plains.

            The nearly 11 inches (28 centimeters) that fell in Portland amounted to the second snowiest day in the city's history. It took drivers by surprise, stalling traffic during the Wednesday evening rush hour and trapping motorists on freeways for hours.

            Some spent the night in their vehicles or abandoned them altogether as crews struggled to clear roads. Other commuters got off spun-out buses and walked in groups to safety. The National Weather Service, which had predicted only a slim chance of significant snow, planned to review its work.











            The weather also knocked out power to almost a million homes and businesses in multiple states, closed schools and grounded or delayed thousands of flights. The system even brought snow to usually balmy Southern California.

            Kim Upham endured a 13-hour ordeal as snow brought to a standstill the traffic on U.S. 26, a mountainous highway that connects Portland to the coast. Already treacherous because of its steep grade, the highway was covered in a sheet of ice, forcing some drivers to leave their cars in the middle of the road.

            “It was so scary to have semi-trucks behind you and semi-trucks in front of you, and you know you’re on a slope,” she said.

            As the hours stretched on, some drivers began to worry about surviving until morning. Upham used a blanket to stay warm and spent the night in her car. To save gas, she turned the vehicle on only intermittently to run the windshield wipers and inch ahead when traffic moved slightly.

            “I really don’t want to die on 26,” she added. “I was thinking that quite often, to be honest with you.”

            The Multnomah County medical examiner’s office said it was investigating a suspected hypothermia death related to the storm. The agency offered no details.

            Amid concern for the thousands of people who live on Portland's streets, city and county officials said they would open three additional overnight shelters Thursday evening, for a total of six. The sites would be able to sleep about 700 people.

            Some reveled in the surprise day off in a place that rarely gets measurable snow.

            Joan Jasper snapped on skis and was gliding through a residential neighborhood.

            “They always have like ‘snowmageddon’ on the news, and so we kind of ignored it — and 11 inches later here we are!” she said. “This is gorgeous.”

            In Southern California, the weather service office in San Diego issued its first-ever blizzard warning, covering the mountains of San Bernardino County from early Friday until Saturday afternoon. San Bernardino County lies east of Los Angeles County, where the first mountain blizzard warning since 1989 was scheduled to take effect at the same time.

            Karen Krenis was driving to a pottery studio in Santa Cruz, California, when she stopped in her tracks after seeing snow on the beach. She got out of her car and went to take photos. By the time she left, about 50 other people were there. Adults were snapping photos, and children were making snowballs.

            “I have lived in California for 30 years, and I’ve never seen anything like it,” Krenis said.

            In Wyoming, roads across much of the southern part of the state were impassable, state officials said.

            Rescuers tried to reach stranded motorists, but high winds and drifting snow created a “near-impossible situation,"" said Sgt. Jeremy Beck of the Wyoming Highway Patrol.

            High winds and heavy snow in the Cascade Mountains prevented search teams from reaching the bodies of three climbers killed over the weekend in an avalanche on Washington state's Colchuck Peak.

            Portland residents had expected no more than a dusting to a few inches. The city uses salt on its roads only in extreme situations for environmental reasons, and the chaos Thursday recalled a similar storm in 2017 that left motorists stranded on freeways and shut down the city for days.

            The weather service originally predicted a 20% chance that Portland would get more than 2 inches (5 centimeters) of snow. The probability of getting 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 centimeters) was only around 5%.

            The forecast changed rapidly as the storm approached, said Colby Neuman, a weather service meteorologist in Portland. He said forecasters would try to figure out why their models were wrong.

            ""There’s a balance there between crying wolf and also informing people so they can make their own decisions,” Neuman said.

            In Arizona, several interstates and other highways were closed due to high winds, falling temperatures and blowing snow. Forecasters said snow could fall as rapidly as 2 to 3 inches (5 to 8 centimeters) per hour.

            A blizzard warning was in effect through Saturday in California for higher elevations of the Sierra Nevada, where predictions called for several feet of snow, 60 mph (96 kph) gusts and wind chills as low as minus 40 degrees (minus 40 Celsius).

            Electrical grids took a beating in the north as heavy ice and strong winds toppled power lines. In California, lines were fouled with tree branches and other debris.

            A Michigan firefighter died Wednesday after coming in contact with a downed power line in the village of Paw Paw, authorities said. Van Buren County Sheriff Dan Abbott called it a tragic accident that was “no fault of the firefighter.”

            Widespread power outages were reported in California, Oregon, Illinois, Michigan and New York, according to the website PowerOutage.us.

            The largest outages by far were in Michigan, where more than 820,000 customers were without electricity, mostly in the state's southeast corner. Power lines and trees were shrouded in ice. DTE Energy said some outages could last through the weekend.

            Afternoon temperatures in the 40s (above 4.4 Celsius) were expected to melt the ice, but DTE said it was bracing for more broken lines.

            “A quarter-inch of ice on an electrical system is the equivalent of a baby grand piano hanging on those wires,” said Trevor Lauer, the president of DTE’s electric arm.

            In the Detroit suburb of Dearborn, the city offered free dry ice, an acknowledgment that power could be out for a while. Ash Quam praised a public works crew for getting a large ice-coated tree limb out of the street.

            “It was so loud when it came crashing down around midnight. By the time I woke up this morning, it was gone,” Quam said on Facebook.

            Weather also contributed to another day of problems at the nation's airports. By Thursday afternoon, more than 2,000 flights were canceled and nearly 14,000 were delayed across the country, according to the tracking service FlightAware.

(AP) — Winter storms sowed more chaos across the U.S. on Thursday, shutting down much of Oregon's largest city with almost a foot of snow and paralyzing travel from parts of the Pacific Coast all the way to the northern Plains.The nearly 11 inches (28 centimeters) that fell in Portland amounted to the second snowiest day in the city's history. It took drivers by surprise, stalling traffic during the Wednesday evening rush hour and trapping motorists on freeways for hours.Some spent the night in their vehicles or abandoned them altogether as crews struggled to clear roads. Other commuters got off spun-out buses and walked in groups to safety. The National Weather Service, which had predicted only a slim chance of significant snow, planned to review its work.The weather also knocked out power to almost a million homes and businesses in multiple states, closed schools and grounded or delayed thousands of flights. The system even brought snow to usually balmy Southern California.Kim Upham endured a 13-hour ordeal as snow brought to a standstill the traffic on U.S. 26, a mountainous highway that connects Portland to the coast. Already treacherous because of its steep grade, the highway was covered in a sheet of ice, forcing some drivers to leave their cars in the middle of the road.“It was so scary to have semi-trucks behind you and semi-trucks in front of you, and you know you’re on a slope,” she said.As the hours stretched on, some drivers began to worry about surviving until morning. Upham used a blanket to stay warm and spent the night in her car. To save gas, she turned the vehicle on only intermittently to run the windshield wipers and inch ahead when traffic moved slightly.“I really don’t want to die on 26,” she added. “I was thinking that quite often, to be honest with you.”The Multnomah County medical examiner’s office said it was investigating a suspected hypothermia death related to the storm. The agency offered no details.Amid concern for the thousands of people who live on Portland's streets, city and county officials said they would open three additional overnight shelters Thursday evening, for a total of six. The sites would be able to sleep about 700 people.Some reveled in the surprise day off in a place that rarely gets measurable snow.Joan Jasper snapped on skis and was gliding through a residential neighborhood.“They always have like ‘snowmageddon’ on the news, and so we kind of ignored it — and 11 inches later here we are!” she said. “This is gorgeous.”In Southern California, the weather service office in San Diego issued its first-ever blizzard warning, covering the mountains of San Bernardino County from early Friday until Saturday afternoon. San Bernardino County lies east of Los Angeles County, where the first mountain blizzard warning since 1989 was scheduled to take effect at the same time.Karen Krenis was driving to a pottery studio in Santa Cruz, California, when she stopped in her tracks after seeing snow on the beach. She got out of her car and went to take photos. By the time she left, about 50 other people were there. Adults were snapping photos, and children were making snowballs.“I have lived in California for 30 years, and I’ve never seen anything like it,” Krenis said.In Wyoming, roads across much of the southern part of the state were impassable, state officials said.Rescuers tried to reach stranded motorists, but high winds and drifting snow created a “near-impossible situation,"" said Sgt. Jeremy Beck of the Wyoming Highway Patrol.High winds and heavy snow in the Cascade Mountains prevented search teams from reaching the bodies of three climbers killed over the weekend in an avalanche on Washington state's Colchuck Peak.Portland residents had expected no more than a dusting to a few inches. The city uses salt on its roads only in extreme situations for environmental reasons, and the chaos Thursday recalled a similar storm in 2017 that left motorists stranded on freeways and shut down the city for days.The weather service originally predicted a 20% chance that Portland would get more than 2 inches (5 centimeters) of snow. The probability of getting 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 centimeters) was only around 5%.The forecast changed rapidly as the storm approached, said Colby Neuman, a weather service meteorologist in Portland. He said forecasters would try to figure out why their models were wrong.""There’s a balance there between crying wolf and also informing people so they can make their own decisions,” Neuman said.In Arizona, several interstates and other highways were closed due to high winds, falling temperatures and blowing snow. Forecasters said snow could fall as rapidly as 2 to 3 inches (5 to 8 centimeters) per hour.A blizzard warning was in effect through Saturday in California for higher elevations of the Sierra Nevada, where predictions called for several feet of snow, 60 mph (96 kph) gusts and wind chills as low as minus 40 degrees (minus 40 Celsius).Electrical grids took a beating in the north as heavy ice and strong winds toppled power lines. In California, lines were fouled with tree branches and other debris.A Michigan firefighter died Wednesday after coming in contact with a downed power line in the village of Paw Paw, authorities said. Van Buren County Sheriff Dan Abbott called it a tragic accident that was “no fault of the firefighter.”Widespread power outages were reported in California, Oregon, Illinois, Michigan and New York, according to the website PowerOutage.us.The largest outages by far were in Michigan, where more than 820,000 customers were without electricity, mostly in the state's southeast corner. Power lines and trees were shrouded in ice. DTE Energy said some outages could last through the weekend.Afternoon temperatures in the 40s (above 4.4 Celsius) were expected to melt the ice, but DTE said it was bracing for more broken lines.“A quarter-inch of ice on an electrical system is the equivalent of a baby grand piano hanging on those wires,” said Trevor Lauer, the president of DTE’s electric arm.In the Detroit suburb of Dearborn, the city offered free dry ice, an acknowledgment that power could be out for a while. Ash Quam praised a public works crew for getting a large ice-coated tree limb out of the street.“It was so loud when it came crashing down around midnight. By the time I woke up this morning, it was gone,” Quam said on Facebook.Weather also contributed to another day of problems at the nation's airports. By Thursday afternoon, more than 2,000 flights were canceled and nearly 14,000 were delayed across the country, according to the tracking service FlightAware.___Salter reported from O’Fallon, Missouri.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819234,Delta Global Bets on Hong Kong to Grow Regional Business on the Back of E-Commerce Boom,"The trusted leader in luxury and sustainable luxury packaging solutions doubles down on Hong Kong as its Asia-Pacific hub and plans regional expansion after robust revenue growth.

HONG KONG SAR -  Media OutReach - 23 February 2023 - Delta Global, the trusted leader in sustainable luxury packaging solutions plans continued expansion in Asia-Pacific on the back of a booming international luxury retail e-commerce market. The UK-based company, which recorded a 55% growth in revenue in the last fiscal year that ended September 30, 2022, will drive its regional expansion efforts from Hong Kong. With Hong Kong’s historically favourable business environment and recent forward-thinking policy announcements from The Hong Kong 2023-24 Budget, the city is the perfect base for Delta Global to grow its footprint and expand in Mainland China, SEA and Australia.                The move comes as direct-to-consumer (D2C) e-commerce channels drive a wave of growth in international retail. According to KPMG, the market grew by 26% in 2020 and 16% in 2021 with D2C channels alone reporting growth of 45% in 2020. Estimates suggest the overall market value neared US$5.5 trillion in 2022. Among the many brands that have benefited from this post-pandemic e-commerce boom are Net-A-Porter and MatchesFashion, both of which rely on Delta Global for stylish and sophisticated boxes and bags that are 100% recyclable and use FSC-certified materials.    Charting the sustainable future of the luxury packaging industry      Driven by a mission to merge luxury, sustainability and innovation through environmentally-friendly packaging solutions and AI-driven supply chain management that enable brands to reduce their carbon footprint, Delta Global is working to change the way businesses and consumers interact with premium retail products. With luxury clients that span the world’s leading retailers and fashion brands – including Harvey Nichols, ZIMMERMANN, TOM FORD, JW Anderson, Ted Baker, Anya Hindmarch, Cefinn and Fortnum & Mason – it offers cutting-edge design and innovation from its in-house creative studio, as well as in-house manufacturing and fully integrated global distribution services.   For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, the company posted revenue growth of 55% with major client wins including ZIMMERMANN, CAMILLA AND MARC, ARNE Clothing and more.   Beyond sustainable packaging, one unique service that has hit a high note with luxury retail clients is the Delta Global Intelligence Platform. This proprietary supply chain management tool enables clients to harness the benefits of data processing and machine learning technologies, addressing their pain points in supply chain management and allowing them to make informed decisions that save valuable time and resources. At the same time, it allows Delta Global to work towards its ultimate goal of producing less packaging in a more sustainable way.   The unique online portal provides access to detailed stock positions at all locations, fully customisable forecasting and planning tools, as well as product reporting and comparison services. Its built-in AI technology learns and understands data and patterns in stock used to improve just-in-time logistics, preventing issues involving undersupply and oversupply to create a more sustainable supply chain and tangible results in reducing a company’s carbon footprint.   “With a clear goal to be the world leader in sustainable luxury packaging, sustainability is at the root of everything we do. Our mission is to produce beautiful products that have as little impact on the environment as possible. We help to guide our clients through every step of the journey from sourcing sustainable materials and innovating in packaging structure to meeting the highest standards of verified innovation and environmental performance - ultimately producing less packaging for more clients,” said  Robert Lockyer, Founder and Chief Client Officer of Delta Global.   Delta Global’s approach to social responsibility enables its clients to actively reduce their carbon footprint and implement best sustainable practices, two key factors that are increasingly driving sales among today’s luxury consumers. According to KPMG, global consumers are placing less importance on luxury or brand names and more on what a brand stands for, what its impact level is and how the brand gives back. In Mainland China and Hong Kong, specifically, corporate responsibility was the second most important factor in potentially changing consumers’ purchasing habits and mentality with 30% of surveyed consumers aged 18 to 24 citing it as a key consideration when making luxury purchases.    Seizing opportunity in the thriving Asia-Pacific region      According to Straits Research, the global luxury packaging market was valued at US$19.4 billion in 2021 and is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 5% in 2022-2030 to reach US$30.5 billion by 2030. As the demand for luxury brands increases in places like China and Korea through channels such as travel retail and e-commerce, the packaging industries for premium brands are likewise anticipated to boom. Other trends driving growth include greater environmental awareness and demand for personalised packaging solutions among consumers, especially the Gen Z and Millennial generations.   With this in mind, Delta Global intends to expand its footprint in Asia, including Hong Kong, Mainland China and Australia, in response to growing retailer needs. Its integrated and collaborative approach to design, manufacturing and distribution ensures that each client benefits from a global partnership that allows them control over the decisions that matter to them.   “We are delighted to learn from The Hong Kong 2023-24 Budget that the government is placing greater emphasis on promoting green tech development. This will undoubtedly arouse corporate and public awareness around sustainable business practices, which perfectly aligns with our vision and mission,” said  Robert Lockyer, Founder and Chief Client Officer of Delta Global. “As Hong Kong charts a new path to growth and launches multiple measures to attract international enterprises and talent, there is no better time for us to double down on our efforts in Hong Kong and leverage its strategic position to expand further into the GBA and APAC.”  Hashtag: #DeltaGlobal

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819245,Australian mining giant Rio Tinto says Taiwan is part of 'Greater China',"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — One of the world’s largest mining corporations, Rio Tinto, which has headquarters in Australia and the U.K., formally changed its designation of Taiwan in its regular revenue reports.Revenues from Taiwanese clients will henceforth be reported as coming from “Greater China,” rather than the previous designation of “other Asian regions,” which excluded China and Japan.The change was reported by the Australian Financial Review in an article with the headline “Rio Tinto reunifies China and Taiwan 26 years early.” The title is in reference to speculation that Beijing previously planned to annex Taiwan by the year 2050.The Financial Review article reported that Rio Tinto receives more than 50% of its annual revenue from China. Furthermore, a Chinese state-owned mining business called Chinalco is Rio Tinto’s largest shareholder with just over 14% ownership.

Chinalco previously attempted to purchase a greater share of Rio Tinto during the 2008 financial crisis, but the deal was blocked by the Australian government, before it was dropped by Rio Tinto. Since then, China’s influence on the mining industry in Australia has been under increased scrutiny.Currently, any Chinese stake of 15% or higher in the company is illegal according to the 2009 ruling of Australia’s Foreign Investment and Review Board.Rio Tinto is one of the world’s primary suppliers of iron ore, bauxite, aluminum, diamonds and borates. In contrast to earnings from China and operations throughout Asia, recent reports from Rio Tinto do not indicate any business activity in Taiwan.In early 2022, Dominic Barton was hired as the chairman of Rio Tinto. Barton previously served as global managing director of McKinsey and Co. from 2009 to 2018, before he was appointed as the Canadian Ambassador to China in 2019 by Justin Trudeau.",2023/2/23,8240,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819273,IS attacks on Syria truffle hunters are deadliest in a year,"BEIRUT (AP) — The Islamic State group has carried out its deadliest attacks in more than a year, killing dozens of civilians and security officers in the deserts of central Syria, even as people of northern Syria have been digging out of the wreckage from the region’s devastating earthquake. 

            The bloodshed was a reminder of the persistent threat from IS, whose sleeper cells still terrorize populations nearly four years after the group was defeated in Syria.

            The attacks also underscored the extremists’ limitations. IS militants have found refuge in the remote deserts of Syria’s interior and along the Iraqi-Syrian border. From there, they lash out against civilians and security forces in both countries. But they are also hemmed in by opponents on all sides: Syrian government troops as well as Kurdish-led fighters who control eastern Syria and are backed by U.S. forces. American raids with their Kurdish-led allies have repeatedly killed or caught IS leaders and, earlier this month, killed two senior IS figures. 











            The IS attacks this month were largely against a very vulnerable target: Syrians hunting truffles in the desert. 

            The truffles are a seasonal delicacy that can be sold for a high price. Since the truffle hunters work in large groups in remote areas, IS militants in previous years have repeatedly preyed on them, emerging from the desert to abduct them, kill some and ransom others for money.

            On Feb. 11, IS fighters kidnapped about 75 truffle hunters outside the town of Palmyra. At least 16 were killed, including a woman and security officers, 25 were released and the rest remain missing. 

            Six days later, on Friday, they attacked a group of truffle hunters outside the desert town of Sukhna, just up the highway from Palmyra, and fought with troops at a security checkpoint close by. At least 61 civilians and seven soldiers were killed. Many of the truffle hunters in the group work for three local businessmen close to the Syrian military and pro-government militias, which may have prompted IS to target them, according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition war monitor, and the Palmyra News Network, an activist collective that covers developments in the desert areas. 

            Smaller attacks around the area killed 12 other people, including soldiers, pro-government fighters and civilians.

            The area is far from the northern regions devastated by the Feb. 6 earthquake that killed more than 46,000 people in Turkey and Syria. Still, IS fighters “took advantage of the earthquake to send a message that the organization is still present,” said Rami Abdurrahman, who heads the Observatory.

            Friday’s attack in Sukhna was the group’s deadliest since January 2022, when IS gunmen stormed a prison in the northeastern city of Hassakeh that held some 3,000 militants and juveniles. Ten days of battles between the militants and U.S.-backed fighters left nearly 500 dead.

            The prison attack raised fears IS was staging a comeback. But it was followed by a series of blows against the group, which reverted to its drumbeat of smaller-scale shootings and bombings.

            It’s too early to say if the new spate of attacks marks a new resurgence, said Aaron Y. Zelin, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. 

            “It’s the biggest attack in a while. So the question is if it’s just a one-off attack or if they are reactivating capabilities,” said Zelin, who closely follows militant Islamic groups and founded Jihadology.net.

            He said IS fighters have been less active every year since 2019 and noted that the recent attacks hit civilians, not tougher security targets. 

            In 2014, IS overran large swaths of Syria and Iraq and declared the entire territory a “caliphate,” where it imposed a radically brutal rule. The U.S. and its allies in Syria and Iraq, as well as Syria's Russian-backed government troops, fought against it for years, eventually rolling it back but also leaving tens of thousands dead and cities in ruins. The group was declared defeated in Iraq in 2017, then in Syria two years later. 

            In 2019, many thought that IS was finished after it lost the last sliver of land it controlled, its founder Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was killed in a U.S. raid and an international crackdown on social media pages linked to the extremists limited its propaganda and recruitment campaigns. 

            Another U.S. raid about a year ago killed al-Baghdadi’s successor, Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi. His replacement was killed in battle with rebels in southern Syria in October.

            The newest IS leader, Abu al-Hussein al-Husseini al-Qurayshi, may be trying to show his strength with the latest attacks, said Abdullah Suleiman Ali, a Syrian researcher who focuses on jihadi groups. The leaders' names are pseudonyms and don't refer to a family relation.

            “The new leader has to take measures to prove himself within the organization … (to show) that the group under the new leadership is capable and strong,” Ali said.

            American troops and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces eliminated a series of senior IS figures this month, according to the U.S. military. On Feb, 10, they killed Ibrahim Al Qahtani, suspected of planning last year’s prison attack, then eight days later they captured an IS official allegedly involved in planning attacks and manufacturing bombs. Last week, a senior IS commander, Hamza al-Homsi, was killed in a raid that also left four American service-members wounded. 

            But IS remains a threat, according to U.N., U.S. and Kurdish officials. 

            It is estimated to have 5,000 to 7,000 members and supporters – around half of them fighters -- in Iraq and Syria, according to a U.N. report this month. IS uses desert hideouts “for remobilization and training purposes” and has spread cells of 15 to 30 people each to other parts of the country, particularly the southern province of Daraa. 

            SDF spokesman Siamand Ali said IS persistently plots attacks in Kurdish-run eastern Syria. He pointed to an attempted attack by IS fighters on SDF security headquarters in the city of Raqqa in December. SDF sweeps since then have captured IS operatives and weapons caches, he said. This is a sign the group was close to carrying out large operations, he said.

            IS in particular aims to storm SDF-run prisons to free militants, he said. Some 10,000 IS fighters, including about 2,000 foreigners, are held in the more than two dozen Kurdish-run detention facilities.

            Gen. Michael “Erik” Kurilla, commander of the U.S. Central Command or CENTCOM, said in a statement this month that IS “continues to represent a threat to not only Iraq and Syria, but to the stability and security of the region.”BEIRUT (AP) — The Islamic State group has carried out its deadliest attacks in more than a year, killing dozens of civilians and security officers in the deserts of central Syria, even as people of northern Syria have been digging out of the wreckage from the region’s devastating earthquake.The bloodshed was a reminder of the persistent threat from IS, whose sleeper cells still terrorize populations nearly four years after the group was defeated in Syria.The attacks also underscored the extremists’ limitations.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819314,The Role of Marketing in Shaping the Future of Virtual Worlds: Exploring the Metaverse,"As technology continues to advance, the concept of virtual worlds has become increasingly popular. The metaverse, a term coined by sci-fi author Neal Stephenson, refers to a fully-realized, immersive virtual world where people can interact with each other in a variety of ways. With the metaverse becoming more of a reality every day, marketing professionals are beginning to explore the ways in which they can use this new landscape to promote products and services. In this article, we will explore the role of marketing in shaping the future of virtual worlds and the metaverse.Virtual worlds offer a unique opportunity for marketers to engage with consumers in a more immersive and interactive way. Traditional advertising methods, such as television commercials or banner ads, can be intrusive and easily ignored. In virtual worlds, however, marketers have the opportunity to create experiences that are integrated into the gameplay or environment. This can include branded virtual goods or even entire branded environments.One of the most successful examples of metaverse marketing in a virtual world is Second Life, a virtual world launched in 2003 that has been used by a variety of brands to promote their products. In Second Life, users can create their own avatars and interact with other users in a fully-realized 3D environment. Brands such as IBM, Coca-Cola, and Adidas have all established a presence in Second Life, creating virtual environments and experiences that align with their brand messaging.The concept of the metaverse takes virtual worlds to the next level, offering a fully-realized and interconnected network of virtual spaces. As the metaverse becomes more of a reality, marketers will need to adapt their strategies to take advantage of this new landscape. One potential use of the metaverse for marketing is the creation of branded virtual experiences that span multiple virtual worlds. This could include virtual pop-up shops or branded events that take place across various virtual environments.Another potential use of the metaverse for marketing is the integration of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies. By using AR and VR, marketers can create even more immersive experiences that allow consumers to interact with products and services in new and innovative ways. For example, a fashion brand could create a virtual fashion show that uses AR to allow users to try on virtual clothing.As the metaverse becomes more of a reality, marketing professionals will need to adapt their strategies to take advantage of this new landscape. Virtual worlds offer a unique opportunity for marketers to create immersive experiences that engage consumers in new and innovative ways. By embracing the metaverse and exploring the possibilities it offers, marketers can help shape the future of virtual worlds and create truly memorable experiences for consumers.",2023/2/23,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819338,Pakistan-Afghan border crossing shut after brief reopening,"PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) — Pakistan shut down a key border crossing with Afghanistan just hours after it was reopened on Thursday, officials said, the latest twist in the controversial closure of the Torkham junction that started earlier this week.

            The issue of the crossing, a key trade route for both Afghanistan and Pakistan, has added to increasing tensions between the two countries, which share a troubled and volatile boundary. 

            Afghanistan's Taliban rulers on Sunday closed the crossing, claiming Islamabad was not abiding by an agreement with Kabul to allow Afghan patients and their caretakers to cross into Pakistan without travel documents for medical care. On Monday, Afghan Taliban forces and Pakistani border guards exchanged fire, which wounded a Pakistani soldier. 











            On Wednesday, Pakistan's defense minister, Khawaja Mohammad Asif, and secret service chief, Lt. Gen. Anjum Nadeem, travelled to Kabul and met senior Taliban officials to discuss the border issue. 

            On Thursday morning, Torkham was reopened by Afghan Taliban forces, allowing some of the thousands of trucks that had lined up for days at the border — many with vegetables, fruits and other perishable food items — to cross over and ease the backlog. 

            The Afghan Embassy in Pakistan tweeted the news of the reopening and on the Pakistani side, truck drivers rejoiced as their vehicles began moving along the Khyber Pass. 

            However, the crossing closed hours later. Ziaul Haq Sarhadi, director of the Pakistan-Afghanistan joint Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said that Pakistan was unable to make the border crossing “fully functional because of administrative issues."" He did not explain.

            Other officials in Islamabad were not immediately available for comment.

            “The Torkham gate has been closed by the Pakistani side after it was opened today by the officials of the Islamic Emirate,” the media center in Afghanistan’s Nangarhar Province said on Twitter. 

            For Pakistan, the Torkham border crossing is a vital commercial artery and a trade route to Central Asian countries. But Islamabad has also accused the Afghan Taliban of providing sanctuary for Pakistani militants whose cross-border attacks have led to a spike in violence in Pakistan.

            The Afghan Taliban administration has said the Pakistani delegation was told during Wednesday's meeting that it was up to Pakistan to provide all the “necessary facilities"" for travelers at Torkham and also at Spin Boldak, another crossing further south, as well as special facilities for the transportation of patients needing emergency medical care. The Pakistani side promised to resolve these matters quickly, Kabul said.

            Closures, cross-border fire and shootouts are common along the Afghan-Pakistan border. 

            Pakistan's Foreign Ministry said its delegation to Kabul also raised during Wednesday's talks “the growing threat of terrorism in the region,"" particularly by the Pakistani Taliban, known as Tahreek-e Taliban-Pakistan or TTP, and the Islamic State group. 

            On Thursday, senior security officials told The Associated Press that the Pakistani delegation demanded the Taliban prevent Pakistani Taliban militants from launching cross-border attacks on Pakistan from within Afghanistan. 

            The demand, the officials said, is urgent as the Pakistani Taliban allegedly plan to launch their “spring offensive” in March. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media.

            Pakistan has recently warned that it has the right to target TTP sanctuaries in Afghanistan if the Taliban administration fails to rein in the militants, increasing the prospect of more cross-border violence. 

            The Pakistani Taliban are a separate group, but allied with the Afghan Taliban, who seized power more than a year ago as the U.S. and NATO troops withdrew from the country after 20 years of war. 

            The Taliban takeover in Afghanistan has emboldened the TTP, which in recent months stepped up attacks in Pakistan, where security forces often raid their hideouts. In the latest raid in the northwestern district of Lakki Marwat, security forces on Thursday killed six Pakistani Taliban militants, police said.

            Also Thursday, troops in Pakistan’s volatile southwestern Baluchistan province, in the district of Kech, raided a militant hideout, killing eight insurgents, the military said. Baluchistan has for years witnessed a low-level insurgency by small groups demanding independence. Although the government says it has quelled the insurgency, violence in the province has persisted.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819339,"In Russia-Ukraine war, more disastrous path could lie ahead","For Russia, it's been a year of bold charges and bombardments, humiliating retreats and grinding sieges. Ukraine has countered with fierce resistance, surprising counteroffensives and unexpected hit-and-run strikes.

            Now, on the anniversary of Russia's invasion that has killed tens of thousands and reduced cities to ruins, both sides are preparing for a potentially even more disastrous phase that lies ahead.

            Russia recently intensified its push to capture all of Ukraine’s eastern industrial heartland of the Donbas. Kyiv and its Western allies also say Moscow could try to launch a wider, more ambitious attack elsewhere along the more than 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line.











            Ukraine is waiting for battle tanks and other new weapons pledged by the West for it to reclaim occupied areas.

            What's nowhere in sight is a settlement.

            The Kremlin insists it must include the recognition of the Crimean Peninsula, which it annexed illegally in 2014, along with the acceptance of its other territorial gains. Ukraine categorically rejects those demands and rules out any talks until Russia withdraws all forces.

            While Putin is determined to achieve his goals, Ukraine and its allies are standing firm on preventing Russia from ending up with any of its land.

            Experts warn that Europe’s largest conflict since World War II could drag on for years, and some fear it could lead to a direct confrontation between Russia and NATO.

            NEW OFFENSIVES, NEW OBJECTIVES

            In recent months, Russian forces have tried to encircle the Ukrainian stronghold of Bakhmut and push deeper into the Donetsk region. Along with fulfilling its goal of capturing the entire Donbas, Moscow aims to wear down Ukrainian forces and prevent them from starting offensives elsewhere.

            Bakhmut has become an important symbol of tenacity for Ukraine, as well as a way to tie up and destroy the most capable Russian forces. Both sides have used up ammunition at a rate unseen in decades.

            Ukrainian military analyst Oleh Zhdanov said Russia has poured more troops and weapons into the Donbas and attacked other areas in an apparent bid to distract Ukrainian forces. 

            “Russia currently has the initiative and the advantage on the battlefield,” he said, noting Kyiv's acute shortage of ammunition.

            Russia has relied on its massive arsenal, and boosted production of weapons and munitions, giving it a significant edge. While Ukrainian and Western intelligence agencies observed that Moscow is running out of precision missiles, it has plenty of old-style weapons.

            But even though Ukraine and its allies expect a wider Russian offensive beyond the Donbas, it could be a gamble for Moscow, which mobilized 300,000 reservists last fall to bolster its forces.

            Igor Strelkov, a former Russian security officer who led separatist forces in the Donbas when fighting erupted there in 2014, warned that any big offensive could be disastrous for Russia because its preparation would be impossible to conceal and attackers would face a devastating response. He said an offensive would also raise logistical challenges like those that thwarted Russia's attempt to capture Kyiv at the war's start.

            “Any large-scale offensive will quickly and inevitably entail very big losses, exhausting the resources accumulated during mobilization,” Strelkov warned.

            Justin Bronk, a senior research fellow at RUSI in London, predicted any Russian offensive would fail, but said it could drain Ukraine’s resources and keep it from preparing its own large-scale counteroffensive.

            “The big question is how much damage does the Russian offensive do before it runs out of steam, because that will dictate the Ukrainian position,” he said, noting that its aim could be to disrupt Kyiv's ability to stage a counteroffensive.

            Bronk said Ukraine spent the winter building up its mechanized brigades that had spearheaded autumn counteroffensives in the Kharkiv and Kherson regions and suffered losses.

            He said Ukraine has a window of opportunity of six to eight months to reclaim more land, noting that Russia could launch another mobilization to recruit up to 500,000 more troops who could be readied for combat after at least six months of training.

            Zhdanov said Ukraine could launch a new counteroffensive in late April or early May after receiving new Western weapons, including battle tanks. He predicted Ukrainian forces will likely attack from the Zaporizhzhia region to try to reclaim the ports of Mariupol and Berdyansk and cut the Russian corridor to Crimea.

            “If Ukraine reaches the Sea of Azov coast, it will nullify all the Russian gains,” Zhdanov said, turning Putin's victories ""to dust.”

            STALEMATE IN UKRAINE OR UPHEAVAL IN RUSSIA?

            Observers see little prospect for talks. Both sides are ""irreconcilable on their current positions,” said Bronk.

            Major Ukrainian battlefield successes this summer could fuel ""significant political turmoil in Russia, because at that point, Putin’s own position within the leadership becomes very, very difficult to see as tenable,” he said.

            At the same time, if Ukraine fails to reclaim more territory before Russia builds up its troops, it could lead to a “long-term stalemate and sort of a grinding attritional war that just kind of goes on and on,” Bronk added, playing into Moscow’s plan “to prolong the war and just wait for the West to get exhausted.”

            Fiona Hill, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who served in the past three U.S. administrations, also saw little prospect for a settlement.

            “The Russians are digging in for the long haul. They have no intention of losing,” she said. “Putin has made it very clear that he’s prepared to sacrifice whatever it takes. His message there is basically saying you can’t possibly counteract me, because I’m willing to do whatever and I’ve got so much more manpower.”

            Hill said Putin is hoping for Western support for Kyiv to dissolve — ""that it goes away and that Ukraine is left exposed, and then that Russia can force Ukraine to capitulate and give up on its territory.”

            Tatiana Stanovaya of the Carnegie Endowment said Putin continues to believe he can achieve his goals by pressing the campaign.

            “For him, the only way he admits it can end is capitulation of Kyiv,” she said.

            THE NUCLEAR OPTION

            Putin has repeatedly said Russia could use “all available means” to protect its territory, a clear reference to its nuclear arsenal.

            Moscow’s nuclear doctrine states that it could use those weapons in response to a nuclear strike or an attack with conventional forces threatening “the very existence of the Russian state,” a formulation that offers broad room for interpretation and abrupt escalation.

            Some Russian hawks urged nuclear strikes on Ukrainian bridges and other key infrastructure to force Kyiv and its allies to accept Moscow’s terms.

            Bronk said he doesn’t expect Russia to resort to that, arguing it would backfire.

            “Actually using them generates almost no practical benefits at all and certainly nothing to compensate for all of the costs, both in terms of immediate escalation risk — irradiating things they want to hold on to and be part of — and also pushing away the rest of the world,” he said. 

            It would be certain to anger China, which doesn’t want the nuclear taboo broken, he added.

            Hill also noted that Russia got some pushback from China and India, who were worried about Putin’s nuclear saber-rattling. She added that Putin sees nuclear threats as a powerful political tool and will keep issuing them in the hope of forcing the West to withdraw support for Ukraine.

            “Putin’s just hoping that everybody’s going to blink,” she said. “He’s not going to give up the idea that he could use a battlefield tactical nuclear weapon.”

            But Hill added: “If he thought he would get the results that he wanted from it, he would use it.”

            Stanovaya, who has long followed Kremlin decision-making, also said Putin’s nuclear threat is no bluff.

            If he sees that Ukraine can attack in a way that threatens Russian territory and lead to Moscow's defeat, ""I think he would be ready to use nuclear weapons in a way that he can show that it’s a question of survival for Russia,” she said.

His message there is basically saying you can’t possibly counteract me, because I’m willing to do whatever and I’ve got so much more manpower.”Hill said Putin is hoping for Western support for Kyiv to dissolve — ""that it goes away and that Ukraine is left exposed, and then that Russia can force Ukraine to capitulate and give up on its territory.”Tatiana Stanovaya of the Carnegie Endowment said Putin continues to believe he can achieve his goals by pressing the campaign.“For him, the only way he admits it can end is capitulation of Kyiv,” she said.THE NUCLEAR OPTIONPutin has repeatedly said Russia could use “all available means” to protect its territory, a clear reference to its nuclear arsenal.Moscow’s nuclear doctrine states that it could use those weapons in response to a nuclear strike or an attack with conventional forces threatening “the very existence of the Russian state,” a formulation that offers broad room for interpretation and abrupt escalation.Some Russian hawks urged nuclear strikes on Ukrainian bridges and other key infrastructure to force Kyiv and its allies to accept Moscow’s terms.Bronk said he doesn’t expect Russia to resort to that, arguing it would backfire.“Actually using them generates almost no practical benefits at all and certainly nothing to compensate for all of the costs, both in terms of immediate escalation risk — irradiating things they want to hold on to and be part of — and also pushing away the rest of the world,” he said.It would be certain to anger China, which doesn’t want the nuclear taboo broken, he added.Hill also noted that Russia got some pushback from China and India, who were worried about Putin’s nuclear saber-rattling. She added that Putin sees nuclear threats as a powerful political tool and will keep issuing them in the hope of forcing the West to withdraw support for Ukraine.“Putin’s just hoping that everybody’s going to blink,” she said. “He’s not going to give up the idea that he could use a battlefield tactical nuclear weapon.”But Hill added: “If he thought he would get the results that he wanted from it, he would use it.”Stanovaya, who has long followed Kremlin decision-making, also said Putin’s nuclear threat is no bluff.If he sees that Ukraine can attack in a way that threatens Russian territory and lead to Moscow's defeat, ""I think he would be ready to use nuclear weapons in a way that he can show that it’s a question of survival for Russia,” she said.___Danica Kirka in London, Andrew Katell in New York and Yuras Karmanau in Tallinn, Estonia, contributed to this report.___Follow the AP’s coverage of Russia’s war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",2023/2/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819340,Max Verstappen sets pace as F1 preseason testing begins,"SAKHIR, Bahrain (AP) — Max Verstappen put in the most miles and put up the fastest time Thursday on the first day of Formula One preseason testing.

            The defending champion from the Netherlands lapped the Bahrain International Circuit .029 seconds faster than Aston Martin driver Fernando Alonso. Verstappen did 157 laps, far more than any other driver and nearly triple the distance of next week’s season-opening Bahrain Grand Prix.

            “Plenty of mileage and some good feedback,"" Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said halfway through the day.











            Carlos Sainz was third-fastest and Ferrari teammate Charles Leclerc was fourth, both just over .4 seconds off Verstappen's time. For Mercedes, Lewis Hamilton was sixth and George Russell was ninth.

            Williams showed signs of being more competitive than last season, with Alex Albon seventh-fastest and new American driver Logan Sargeant 10th.

            The session had barely started when Felipe Drugovich ground to a halt on his first run for Aston Martin with what team principal Mike Krack called an “electric glitch.” The session was red-flagged and Drugovich's car was taken away on a truck under a cover to prevent other teams from taking notes on its design. He was able to return to the track and was 14th fastest.

            Drugovich, the Formula Two champion, is stepping in for regular Aston Martin driver Lance Stroll after the Canadian hurt his wrist while cycling as part of his fitness training. The season begins with the Bahrain Grand Prix at the same track next week.

            “For precaution reasons we decided it’s better to wait a bit (on Stroll's recovery) and be ready next week,” Krack said.

            With few major rule changes for 2023, there are only three days of preseason testing, with one car per team. That rule is meant to cut costs but favors big teams who can do more advanced analysis off the track, Haas driver Kevin Magnussen said.

            “We as small teams don’t have the same tools that they have,” he said.

            There were six days of tests last season after major changes including the return of “ground effect” aerodynamics, which caused many cars to suffer from uncontrollable bouncing and vibrations at high speed. Early indications from Thursday's test indicate that is much less of an issue, Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff said.

            His team was one of the worst affected last year.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819341,Wednesday's Sports In Brief,"NBA

            LOS ANGELES (AP) — Russell Westbrook signed with the Los Angeles Clippers after he cleared waivers on Wednesday afternoon.

            The nine-time All-Star was waived by the Utah Jazz on Monday. He cleared waivers because no team has the salary cap space to take on the remaining $47 million he was owed on his expiring contract.











            There is an outside chance Westbrook could practice Thursday if he passes his physical. The Clippers — fourth in the Western Conference with a 33-28 record — host Sacramento on Friday in their first game after the All-Star break.

            The move keeps Westbrook in Los Angeles. He is from the area, was a standout at UCLA and played less than two seasons for the Lakers before being traded to the Jazz on Feb. 10 as part of a three-team deal.

            The 15-year veteran is averaging 15.9 points, 6.2 rebounds, and 7.1 assists in 28.7 minutes per game.

            Westbrook is reuniting with Paul George, his former teammate in Oklahoma City. George had lobbied the front office to add a point guard.

            SOCCER

            FRISCO, Texas (AP) — Alex Morgan and Mallory Swanson scored and the United States defeated Brazil 2-1 on Wednesday night to win the SheBelieves Cup for the fourth straight year. 

            Japan, which defeated Canada 3-0 in the earlier match at Toyota Stadium, was runner-up in the four-team, round-robin tournament. All four SheBelieves Cup teams will play in Women’s World Cup this summer in Australia and New Zealand. 

            Morgan’s curling goal sailed out of reach of Brazilian goalkeeper Lorena. Morgan now has five goals all-time in SheBelieves matches. 

            It was Morgan’s 14th goal since the birth of her daughter in 2020, giving her the national team record for most goals as a mom. 

            Swanson scored in the 63rd minute, her fourth goal of the tournament and seventh overall goal this year, matching her total of all of last year. 

            Swanson, formerly Mallory Pugh, married Chicago Cubs shortstop Dansby Swanson in December. 

            GOLF

            A federal judge has ruled the PGA Tour can add Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund and its governor, Yasir al-Rumayyan, as defendants in its countersuit in the ongoing legal fight with LIV Golf.

            The ruling Tuesday by U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman was the second setback in the last week for Saudi-funded LIV Golf, which has accused the PGA Tour of monopolistic actions as the rival league gets started.

            LIV Golf’s second season kicks off Friday at a Mexican beach resort south of Cancun.

            U.S. Magistrate Judge Susan van Keulen last week ruled the Public Investment Fund, which owns 93% of LIV Golf, and al-Rumayyan are required to give testimony and produce documents related to the antitrust lawsuit.

            Now their involvement deepens as defendants in the countersuit.

            Lawyers for PIF and al-Rumayyan had sought to quash subpoenas claiming sovereign immunity. They are expected to appeal van Keulen’s decision that their involvement falls under the commercial activity exception to the Foreign Sovereign Immunity Act.

            The dispute centers around LIV’s argument that PIF and al-Rumayyan were investors, while the PGA Tour says documents obtained during the discovery process indicate they were actively involved in attracting players to join the league and thus breach contracts with the PGA Tour.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819342,"Bird flu kills 11-year-old girl in Cambodia, officials say","PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) — An 11-year-old girl in Cambodia has died from bird flu in the country's first known human H5N1 infection since 2014, health officials said.

            Bird flu, also known as avian influenza, normally spreads in poultry and wasn’t deemed a threat to people until a 1997 outbreak among visitors to live poultry markets in Hong Kong. Most human cases worldwide have involved direct contact with infected poultry, but concerns have arisen recently about infections in a variety of mammals and the possibility the virus could evolve to spread more easily between people.

            The girl from the rural southeastern province of Prey Veng became ill Feb. 16 and was sent to be treated at hospital in the capital, Phnom Penh. She was diagnosed Wednesday after suffering a fever up to 39 Celsius (102 Fahrenheit) with coughing and throat pain and died shortly afterward, the Health Ministry said in a statement Wednesday night.











            Health officials have taken samples from a dead wild bird at a conservation area near the girl's home, the ministry said in another statement Thursday. It said teams in the area would also warn residents about touching dead and sick birds.

            Cambodian Health Minister Mam Bunheng warned that bird flu poses an especially high risk to children who may be feeding or collecting eggs from domesticated poultry, playing with the birds or cleaning their cages. 

            Symptoms of H5N1 infection are similar to that of other flus, including cough, aches and fever, and in serious cases, patients can develop life-threatening pneumonia.

            Cambodia had 56 human cases of H5N1 from 2003 through 2014 and 37 of them were fatal, according to the World Health Organization. 

            Globally, about 870 human infections and 457 deaths have been reported to the WHO in 21 countries. But the pace has slowed, and there have been about 170 infections and 50 deaths in the last seven years.

            WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus earlier this month expressed concern about avian influenza infections in mammals including minks, otters, foxes and sea lions.

            “H5N1 has spread widely in wild birds and poultry for 25 years, but the recent spillover to mammals needs to be monitored closely,” he warned.

            In January, a 9-year-old girl in Ecuador became the first reported case of human infection in Latin America and the Caribbean. She was treated with antiviral medicine. 

            Tedros said earlier this month that the WHO still assesses the risk from bird flu to humans as low.

            “But we cannot assume that will remain the case, and we must prepare for any change in the status quo,” he said. He advised for people not to touch dead or sick wild animals and for countries to strengthen their surveillance of settings where people and animals interact.PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) — An 11-year-old girl in Cambodia has died from bird flu in the country's first known human H5N1 infection since 2014, health officials said.Bird flu, also known as avian influenza, normally spreads in poultry and wasn’t deemed a threat to people until a 1997 outbreak among visitors to live poultry markets in Hong Kong.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819343,Abu Dhabi state gas firm looks to raise $2B in IPO,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Abu Dhabi's state gas company expects to raise up to $2 billion by selling 4% of its shares in an initial public offering, the company said Thursday.

            It said the price range for the previously announced sale of over 3 billion shares has been set at 2.25 to 2.34 Emirati dirhams, valuing the company at up to $50.8 billion. The subscription period begins Thursday, with the final offer price expected to be announced March 3.

            The Abu Dhabi National Oil Company has access to 95% of the UAE’s natural gas reserves, the world’s seventh largest. Its gas division, known as ADNOC Gas, supplies more than 60% of the local market and exports to more than 20 countries.











            The gas company had a net income of $4.2 billion in the first 10 months of 2022, up from $3.6 billion in all of 2021.

            A similar IPO by Saudi Arabia's state-owned oil giant Aramco in 2019 raised some $30 billion.

            Sultan al-Jaber, the CEO of ADNOC, who also oversees renewable energy projects in the United Arab Emirates, was selected to chair this year's COP28 U.N. climate talks, angering climate change activists.

He proposed the Ministry of Labor (MOL) should introduce a limited opening of the sector to foreign workers.However, in a radio interview Thursday, Hsu emphasized the service sector was a major source of employment for local workers. She also dispelled the suggestion that foreign staff would be cheaper, as the official minimum wage of NT$26,400 added with various food and management costs would raise the total to about NT$32,000.The minister also said that employing foreign workers would not be simple, Radio Taiwan International (RTI) reported. In addition, she noted the low wages valid in the hotel sector.Some employers required staff to speak fluent English and Japanese, but they were only willing to pay NT$28,000 a month, Hsu said. She also criticized the selection process, which was too slow, leading candidates to abandon the hotel sector and look for higher-paying jobs elsewhere.",2023/2/23,2036,Business

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819370,Yellen affirms push for stronger Russia sanctions at G-20,"BENGALURU, India (AP) — The U.S. wants to see tougher and more effectively enforced sanctions against Russia and additional support for Ukraine, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Thursday during meetings of the Group of 20 leading economies in the Indian technology hub of Bengaluru.

            Speaking on the eve of the anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Yellen said sanctions against Moscow were working but more needed to be done to hobble the Russian war effort while supporting Ukraine. 

            “We are seeking to strengthen sanctions and make sure that we address violations of sanctions,"" she said, noting that the Russians were seeking alternative ways to “backfill"" parts and equipment to replace and repair weapons damaged in the war. 











            “We have deprived them of many channels they can obtain material that is critical for their defense efforts,"" Yellen told reporters. “That is a particular focus we have in mind in respect to enforcement of existing sanctions and perhaps with respect to further sanctions.”

            Yellen said the U.S. expects to provide another $10 billion in assistance to Ukraine on top of more than $46 billion already given. She commended allies for their direct aid and said the role of the International Monetary Fund in those efforts is “critical."" 

            “We very much want to see the IMF negotiate an agreement to lend to Ukraine,"" she said, noting that the fund's managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, hopes to work out a full program by the end of March.

            Yellen said that work “could not come soon enough” as well as on extending the Black Sea Grain Initiative that allows shipments from Ukraine and other efforts to improve food security.

            Given the “strong language"" on the war included in the G-20's final statement at summit meetings in Indonesia in November, Yellen said she believed a strong condemnation of the war and its impact on the world economy is achievable in Bengaluru, though the issue is still under discussion. 

            In Bali, G-20 leaders declared that most strongly condemned the war, warning the conflict is intensifying fragilities in the world’s economy. They finessed divisions among them given that the group includes Russia and also countries like China and India that have significant trade ties with Moscow and have stopped short of outright criticism of the war. 

            Overall, the G-20 is a forum focused on economic rather than security concerns. In Bengaluru, finance ministers, central bank governors and other leaders are due to discuss a range of issues, including climate finance, regulating digital currencies, global taxation efforts and other financial priorities.

            Turning to such topics, Yellen said the global economy was “in a better place” than several months ago as inflation eases and supply disruptions ease but warned that “we’re not out of the woods yet.”

            She spoke with reporters after meeting with India’s finance minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, whom she thanked for India's help in trying to resolve debt crises, particularly for its neighbor, Sri Lanka. The Indian Ocean nation is embroiled in a humanitarian catastrophe, strapped by shortages of food, fuel and medicines, among many things. 

            Yellen urged China to work with other donor countries in addressing the problem.

            Many countries face daunting debt “overhangs,"" Yellen said, after costly efforts to cushion the worst effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Such woes have deepened as countries’ import bills surged due to sustained higher prices for food, oil and fertilizers and weakening currencies. 

            
                Yellen visited Zambia in January, in part to discuss the African country’s $6 billion debt to China, its biggest creditor. Zambia became Africa’s first pandemic-era nation to default when it failed to make a $42.5 million bond payment in November 2020.

            But a slew of other countries, from Laos and Afghanistan to Venezuela and Argentina, have seen their finances deteriorate in the past year. The IMF estimates that about 55% of all low-income countries are near or in debt distress.

            At a press conference on the sidelines of the meeting, Japanese Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki said the smaller Group of 7 democracies are advising multilateral banks to review their business models to better address poverty reduction and achieve sustainable development goals. 

            “We will continue to closely work with other G-20 members to address debt issues of vulnerable middle-income countries such as Sri Lanka,” he said. 

            China is one of Sri Lanka’s biggest creditors after extending it loans to build a port and other facilities. It has offered a two-year suspension of repayments but balked at reducing the amount owed. The IMF has set a reduction in debt as a condition for an emergency loan. 

            Suzuki said the G-7 is working to resolve debt issues for Ethiopia, Ghana and Zambia.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819371,"Ahmed Qureia, top Palestinian negotiator with Israel, dies","RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) — Ahmed Qureia, a former Palestinian prime minister and one of the architects of interim peace deals with Israel, has died at age 85.

            A key player in the 1993 Oslo peace accords, Qureia witnessed the rise of the dream of Palestinian statehood that surged during the negotiations. But he also saw those hopes recede, with the prospect of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict drifting further than ever. Domestically, Qureia was riddled with corruption charges that tainted his reputation.

            Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas confirmed Qureia's death on Wednesday. The cause of death was not immediately made public, but Qureia had been ill for some time with a heart condition.











            “Abu Alaa stood in the lead defending the causes of his home and people,” Abbas said in a statement carried by the official Wafa news agency, using Qureia’s nickname.

            Born in 1937 in Abu Dis, suburb of east Jerusalem in the occupied West Bank, Qureia joined the Fatah movement in 1968. 

            He rose quickly through the ranks under the leadership of its founder, late Palestinian President Yasser Arafat, and became a member of its decision-making body, the Central Committee, in 1989. He was also a member of the PLO Executive Committee. 

            Qureia headed the Palestinian delegation to Oslo, where intensive talks with Israel led to the peace accords in 1993, which created the Palestinian Authority and set up self-rule areas in the Palestinian territories. During ensuing rounds of negotiations with Israelis, he met all Israeli prime ministers who were in office before 2004, including Yitzhak Rabin, Ariel Sharon, Shimon Peres, Benjamin Netanyahu and Ehud Olmert, and U.S. Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.

            Peace talks have collapsed in the three decades since the accords. Israel has driven up settlement building in the West Bank, and imposed a blockade on the Gaza Strip after the Islamic militant Hamas took power there after it routed forces loyal to Fatah. Violence is again flaring up between the sides, especially in the West Bank.

            In a 2013 interview with the Associated Press marking two decades since the Oslo agreements, Qureia said that if he knew then what he knows now he wouldn’t have agreed to the accords.

            “With such kinds of blocs of settlements? No. With the closure of Jerusalem? No. Not at all,” Qureia said in an interview at his office in the Jerusalem suburb of Abu Dis.

            After the establishment of the PA, Qureia won a seat in the first parliamentary elections in 1996 and chaired the Palestinian Legislative Council.

            After Abbas resigned as the PA’s first prime minister in 2003, Arafat replaced him with Qureia. He held the post until 2006, when the militant Hamas group scored a landslide victory in the second Palestinian elections.

            During his tenure as prime minister, Qureia was the subject of controversy after reports accused his family of having financial interest in a company that sold Egyptian cement to Israel, which the latter used to build the West Bank separation barrier.RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) — Ahmed Qureia, a former Palestinian prime minister and one of the architects of interim peace deals with Israel, has died at age 85.A key player in the 1993 Oslo peace accords, Qureia witnessed the rise of the dream of Palestinian statehood that surged during the negotiations.

However, under a revised system for accounting road deaths, the official reported number will be 269 less, according to CNA.That is because of the ministry’s decision to remove death by natural causes while on the roads from the count. Executive Secretary of the Ministry’s Road Traffic Safety Advisory Committee Huang Yun-kuei (黃運貴) said this would more accurately reflect the true number of road related fatalities.Huang said that death by natural causes on Taiwan’s roads accounted for between 8-9% of the total number. Using the new counting method, Taiwan will follow the standard of the U.S., Britain, New Zealand, Canada, Australia, Germany, and France, he added.",2023/2/23,1040,Society
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819380,Cut sea cables said to be China's dry run to end Taiwan's internet,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A think tank analyst and columnist for Foreign Policy believes the cutting of two undersea cables tying Taiwan to the outlying Matsu Islands is a dress rehearsal for the complete severing of Taiwan's internet.Chunghwa Telecom's two Taiwan-Matsu submarine cables suffered catastrophic outages on the evening of Feb. 2 and at noon on Feb. 8, drastically affecting customer communication services in the Matsu area. National Communications Commission (NCC) deputy chairman and spokesperson Wong Po-tsung (翁柏宗) said on Feb.17 that according to Chunghwa Telecom, the Taima No. 2 submarine cable was cut by a Chinese fishing boat, and the Taima No. 3 submarine cable was damaged by a Chinese cargo ship.There are suspicions in Taiwan the cables were deliberately cut by the Chinese ships and industry insiders point to two factors that raise concerns. First, it is unprecedented for two submarine cables between Taiwan and Matsu to be cut within just six days.Secondly, the damage occurred close to Matsu. However, telecom executives said that it is difficult to present irrefutable evidence of malicious intent.On Tuesday (Feb. 21), Foreign Police published an analysis of the incidents by Elisabeth Braw, a national security expert at the American Enterprise Institute. She wrote that it is not unusual for undersea cables to suffer damage, ""but losing two in a row is either really unfortunate or quite possibly not a coincidence.""Braw wrote that while the U.S. was paying attention to the sky after the spy balloon incident, China may have been conducting operations at sea. She said Beijing is now watching how the inhabitants of Matsu cope and how they will manage to reconnect with Taiwan proper.She said the location of 380 submarine cables around the world is not a secret, and there are maps detailing their locations to ensure that fishing boat nets do not accidentally damage the cables. The International Cable Protection Committee reports 100 to 200 instances of damaged cables per year.Of these incidents, only 50 to 100 involved fishing boats, while the rest were caused by construction or other activities. Braw reasoned the incidence of damage to the cables linking Matsu was ""disproportionately frequent.""Braw said that so far the cable breaking incidents have mainly involved Chinese sand dredgers and such activity is an example of gray-zone tactics. In addition to requiring the dispatch of Taiwanese patrol ships to drive these dredgers away, it also harms the ecology and seabed, as well as Matsu's operations and communications.She warned that the sabotage of undersea cables could be ""our era's blockade"" and unlike in previous generations, it can be carried out surreptitiously. Braw said other telecoms are looking at Chunghwa's Telecom's backup operations, such as burying them beneath the seabed.She warned that the sabotage of undersea cables could pose a diplomatic challenge for Western governments. ""Responding to a devastating but invisible blockade could become one of the thorniest diplomatic challenges facing Western governments.""",2023/2/23,7250,Politics

The growth of the market is attributable to the rising investments from the government authorities of the country, the growing number of data breaching incidents across Japan, and growing geopolitical tensions with ChinaA recent study by the strategic consulting and market research firmReport Ocean revealed that Japan cybersecurity market was worth USD 6.4 billion in 2021. The market is further anticipated to grow at a robust CAGR of 22.6% during the forecast period, i.e., 2022-2030, and reach USD 38.9 billion by 2030. The growth of Japan’s cyber security market is attributable to the rising investments from the government authorities of the country, the growing number of data breaching incidents across Japan, and growing geopolitical tensions with China. Furthermore, to strengthen its response to cyberesecurity, Japan’s National Police Agency is bolstering their capabilities, thereby fueling the growth of Japan cybersecurity market.The Growing Pressure On The Healthcare Sector Offering Lucrative Opportunity to Industry PlayersThe healthcare sector in Japan has been facing increasing pressure. According to the National Statistics Bureau of Japan, the number of people aged 65 and over in Japan was 36.19 million in 2020, accounting for 28.8% of the total population. In 2015, the same statistic was found at around 26.6%, indicating a rapid increase in the aging population in Japan. A growing geriatric population indicates a growing pressure on the countrys healthcare system, necessitating the storage of more diagnostic tests and sensitive patient information. Considering that healthcare is one of the most susceptible areas to cyber attacks, the growing amount of data entails more vulnerability to cybercriminals if the data is not handled properly. It would therefore require more robust cybersecurity software, which would boost the market’s growth.Request Sample Data To Learn More About This Report@https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=MR486Growing Recession in Japan is Pushing for Cheaper Alternatives and Diminishing Cybersecurity, thereby Affecting Market GrowthThe growing recession across the country spurred SMEs to budget their investment allocations. The land of the rising sun is often considered a land of cyclical recessions, the latest being back in 2015 and now with the pandemic. The high cost of cybersecurity has deterred smaller companies from investing in it because of crippling inflation rates. Despite the steps taken by the Japanese government to develop measures and implement cyber defense capabilities across its governmental authorities, the degree of emphasis is relatively low.On-Premises Deployment Mode Dominate Japan Cybersecurity MarketThe Japan cyber security market is segmented into cloud and on-premises based on deployment modes. The on-premises segment registered a larger market share in 2021. On the other hand, the cloud segment is projected to register the fastest CAGR in the coming years. Being one of the most technologically-driven countries, Japan has witnessed rapid growth in incorporating cloud services across its domestic market. In October 2021, the Japanese government announced that Japan’s Digital Agency is coming into a pact with Google and AES for incorporating cloud computing services for eight of their municipalities. Government budgets are expected to remain low until March 2022 with USD 17 million, but they are expected to grow over the next few years, leading to more opportunities for cloud computing in the UAE. Consequently, the trend is indicating an increasing inclination towards cloud computing across the country, which will enhance cyber security capabilities to be deployed via cloud resources, thus driving the segment’s growth.Impact of COVID-19 on Japan Cybersecurity MarketThe COVID-19 outbreak has positively impacted Japan cyber security market. Due to the work-from-home trend and the adoption of digital technologies, Japan has recorded many instances of cyber-attacks from China and Russia during the pandemic. For instance, the APT group’s global cyber campaign codenamed “Cicada” targeted Japanese organizations, which was uncovered by cybersecurity firm Symantec in 2020. Furthermore, in 2021, the Japanese messaging company LINE revealed that Chinese subcontractors had accessed its Japanese servers which contained the personal data of 86 million users. Additionally, those monitoring functions had also been outsourced to a Chinese entity. These factors have increased the demand for the cybersecurity market in the country.Sample of This Strategic Report:https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=MR486Japan Cybersecurity Market – Competitive LandscapeJapan cyber security market is moderately fragmented due to the presence of various domestic and international players in the domain. Cybersecurity has always been a lesser priority for Japan. Therefore, the country is considered unsafe in terms of cybersecurity. There has been some shift in the trend, however.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819454,IRA dissidents suspected of shooting N Ireland detective,"LONDON (AP) — A senior Northern Ireland police officer was in critical but stable condition in a hospital after two masked men shot him after he coached a children’s soccer team, authorities said Thursday.

            A dissident Irish Republican Army splinter group is suspected of shooting the detective Wednesday night after a kids' soccer session at a sports complex in Omagh, about 60 miles (nearly 100 kilometers) west of Belfast. Three men were arrested Thursday on suspicion of attempted murder. 

            The Police Service of Northern Ireland named the wounded officer as Detective Chief Inspector John Caldwell, a well-known officer who has led investigations into murders, organized crime and dissident paramilitary groups.











            The leader of the police force, Chief Constable Simon Byrne, called the shooting “a brazen and calculated attack.”

            “Our thoughts are with John and his family as he fights for his life in hospital today,” Byrne told reporters.

            Assistant Chief Constable Mark McEwan said two gunmen attacked Caldwell as he put soccer balls into the trunk of his car, accompanied by his young son. Caldwell had just coached an under-15s soccer team.

            McEwan told BBC Radio Ulster that “the primary focus is on violent dissident republicans and within that, there is a primary focus as well on New IRA.”

            The force said three men, ages 38, 45 and 47, were arrested and being questioned at a Belfast police station.

            Politicians from across Ireland’s political divide, and the leaders of the U.K. and Ireland, condemned the attack.

            The leaders of the five biggest parties, including Irish nationalists Sinn Fein — which was allied with the IRA during Northern Ireland's decades of Catholic-Protestant violence — and the Democratic Unionist Party, issued a rare joint statement to condemn the violence.

            “We speak for the overwhelming majority of people right across our community who are outraged and sickened by this reprehensible and callous attempted murder,” they said.

            “There is absolutely no tolerance for such attacks by the enemies of our peace.”

            More than 3,000 people were killed during three decades of violence in Northern Ireland involving Irish republican and British loyalist paramilitaries and U.K. security forces.

            The 1998 Good Friday peace accord largely ended the conflict, known as “the Troubles.” Major Catholic and Protestant paramilitary groups gave up violence and disarmed, but small IRA splinter groups continue to mount sporadic attacks on security forces.

            In November, a homemade bomb exploded under a police car in the town of Strabane. The two officers inside escaped injury.

            In April 2019, journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead while reporting on rioting in Londonderry, also known as Derry. The New IRA said one of its gunmen hit her by accident while targeting police.

            The last fatal attack on a police officer in Northern Ireland was the April 2011 killing of Constable Ronan Kerr, who died when a booby-trap bomb exploded under his car in Omagh.

            Omagh was also the site of Northern Ireland’s deadliest attack, an August 1998 car bombing that killed 29 people. A dissident republican group called the Real IRA claimed responsibility for that attack.LONDON (AP) — A senior Northern Ireland police officer was in critical but stable condition in a hospital after two masked men shot him after he coached a children’s soccer team, authorities said Thursday.A dissident Irish Republican Army splinter group is suspected of shooting the detective Wednesday night after a kids' soccer session at a sports complex in Omagh, about 60 miles (nearly 100 kilometers) west of Belfast.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819455,Iran acknowledges accusation it enriched uranium to 84%,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iran on Thursday directly acknowledged an accusation attributed to international inspectors that it enriched uranium to 84% purity for the first time, which would put the Islamic Republic closer than ever to weapons-grade material. 

            The acknowledgement by a news website linked to the highest reaches of Iran's theocracy renews pressure on the West to address Tehran's program, which had been contained by the 2015 nuclear deal from which America unilaterally withdrew in 2018. Years of attacks across the Middle East have followed.

            Already Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who recently regained his country's premiership, is threatening to take military action similar to when Israel previously bombed nuclear programs in Iraq and Syria. But while those attacks saw no war erupt, Iran has an arsenal of ballistic missiles, drones and other weaponry it and its allies already have used in the region. 











            The acknowledgment came from Nour News, a website linked to Iran's Supreme National Security Council, overseen by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Nour News separately is sanctioned by Canada for having “participated in gross and systematic human rights violations and perpetuated disinformation activities to justify the Iranian regime’s repression and persecution of its citizens"" amid nationwide protests there.

            The comments by Nour News follow days of muddled comments by Iran not directly acknowledging the accusation by inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency that Iran had enriched up to 84%. 

            Bloomberg first reported Sunday that inspectors had detected uranium particles enriched up to 84%. The IAEA, a United Nations agency based in Vienna, has not denied the report, saying only “that the IAEA is discussing with Iran the results of recent agency verification activities.” 

            In its comments Thursday, Nour News urged the IAEA to “not fall prey to the seduction of Western countries” and declare that Iran's nuclear program was “completely peaceful.” 

            “It will be clear soon that the IAEA surprising report of discovering 84% enriched uranium particles in Iran’s enrichment facilities was an inspector’s error or was a deliberate action to create political atmospheres against Iran on the eve of the meeting of"" its board, Nour News said on Twitter. The board, a group of nations that oversees the IAEA, will meet beginning March 6 in Vienna. 

            The IAEA did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday over Nour News' remarks. 

            It wasn't immediately clear where the 84% enrichment allegedly took place, though the IAEA has said it found two cascades of advanced IR-6 centrifuges at Iran's underground Fordo facility “interconnected in a way that was substantially different from the mode of operation declared by Iran to the agency in November last year.” Iran is known to have been enriching uranium at Fordo up to 60% purity — at level which nonproliferation experts already say has no civilian use for Tehran. 

            Iran also enriches uranium at its Natanz nuclear site.

            Weapons-grade uranium is enriched up to 90%. While the IAEA's director-general has warned Iran now has enough uranium to produce “several” nuclear bombs if it chooses, it likely would take months more to build a weapon and potentially miniaturize it to put on a missile. 

            The new tensions over Iran's program also take place against the backdrop of a shadow war between Iran and Israel that has spilled out across the wider Middle East. Netanyahu, who long has advocated military action against Iran, mentioned it again in a talk this week.

            “How do you stop a rogue nation from acquiring nuclear weapons?” Netanyahu rhetorically asked. “You had one that’s called Saddam Hussein’s Iraq. It was stopped by military force, ours. You had a second one that is called Syria that tried to develop nuclear weapons. And it was stopped by a military action, ours.”

            He added: “A necessary condition, and an often sufficient condition, is credible military action. The longer you wait, the harder that becomes. We’ve waited very long.” 

            Late Thursday night, online videos showed explosions and anti-aircraft fire in Karaj, a city about 40 kilometers (25 miles) northwest of the Iranian capital, Tehran. Tracer rounds lit up the night sky, with the thud of blasts heard in the videos. 

            Iran's state-run IRNA news agency later attributed the activity to an unannounced drill at a base for the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard. In 2021, a suspected Israeli strike drone damaged a centrifuge assembly facility in Karaj.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819456,Divided Cyprus' new president scopes out peace talks reset,"NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) — The new president of Cyprus met informally with the leader of the breakaway Turkish Cypriots on Thursday to test the waters on reviving stalemated talks to end the island’s ethnic division, which has been a source of instability in the east Mediterranean for decades.

            The two-hour meeting, hosted by the head of the U.N. peacekeeping mission on the island, was the first for President-elect Nikos Christodoulides following his election victory earlier this month. The fact that it took place even before Christodoulides — a former foreign minister — formally assumes office on March 1 aimed to underscore a campaign pledge to keep a peace deal as an overriding priority.

            But the meeting itself is no harbinger of a breakthrough anytime soon, because seemingly insurmountable obstacles still stand in the way of a peace deal. Chief among those obstacles is an about-face by Turkey and the minority Turkish Cypriots regarding the agreed-upon shape of a deal after the most recent failed push for peace at a Swiss resort in the summer of 2017. 











            The island’s division came about in 1974 when Turkey invaded in the wake of a coup aimed at union with Greece. Only Turkey recognizes a Turkish Cypriot declaration of independence in the island’s northern third and it maintains more than 35,000 troops there. Cyprus joined the European Union in 2004, but only the Greek Cypriot south enjoys full membership benefits. 

            There had been a long-held understanding that any deal would reunify Cyprus as a federation composed of a Turkish-speaking zone in the north and a Greek speaking zone in the south. But Turkey and the Turkish Cypriots are now seeking a two-state deal that recognizes separate Turkish Cypriot sovereignty, something that Greek Cypriots reject out of hand and which has also been rejected by the European Union, the United Nations, the U.S. and other countries.

            Turkish Cypriot leader Ersin Tatar has said that he’s open to dialogue, but warned there’s “no flexibility or retreat” from the two-state proposal as well as a permanent Turkish troop presence on the island and military intervention rights for Ankara — all non-starters for the Greek Cypriot side.

            “You can never impose on us a settlement saying that ‘this is what the EU says,’ burying your head in the sand,” Tatar said. “Our red line is our sovereignty.""

            Emerging from Thursday’s meeting, Tatar repeated there can be no formal return to the negotiating table without the recognition of Turkish Cypriot sovereignty. He also raised the possibility of the two sides working together on dealing with potential earthquakes on the island. Christodoulides said that could be done through established “technical committees” formed to foster cooperation on a wide range of fields, such as restoration of cultural monuments on either side.

            Christodoulides told The Associated Press prior to the meeting that he’s “fully aware” of the obstacles, “but that doesn’t mean that we mustn’t do everything possible to break the current deadlock.”

            The president-elect said key to any peace deal would be the EU’s active involvement in U.N.-led talks through the appointment by EU leaders of a “strong political personality.”

            He said Turkey could be made more amenable to a deal if things that it has long sought from the EU — including upgrading its customs union with the bloc, visa-free travel for its citizens and unfreezing its EU membership bid — can be put on the negotiating table.

            Christodoulides said after the meeting that he “didn’t hear anything that he wasn’t expecting” from Tatar, but that he had proposed to the Turkish Cypriot leader to meet again socially with their wives.

            A potential deal could expedite the development of sizable natural gas deposits off Cyprus’ southern shores amid Europe’s energy crunch and remove a major thorn in the rocky relationship between NATO allies Greece and Turkey.

            “The EU has all the tools that could create a beneficial state of affairs in which all sides will have nothing but to gain from a Cyprus settlement,” Christodoulides said.NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) — The new president of Cyprus met informally with the leader of the breakaway Turkish Cypriots on Thursday to test the waters on reviving stalemated talks to end the island’s ethnic division, which has been a source of instability in the east Mediterranean for decades.The two-hour meeting, hosted by the head of the U.N. peacekeeping mission on the island, was the first for President-elect Nikos Christodoulides following his election victory earlier this month.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819457,AP PHOTOS: 'Imperfect' models in Italy redefine beauty,"ROME (AP) — A project on Instagram to highlight ordinary women and their imperfections has transformed into a modeling agency that aims to redefine notions of beauty in Italy. 

            The Imperfetta (Imperfect) modeling agency, started in 2020 by Carlotta Giancane, has a casting book full of models who defy the industry’s pre-established standards of beauty. They are of all sizes and ages, spanning the gender spectrum, some with disabilities or medical conditions like alopecia or vitiligo, visible scarring or who have lost limbs. 

            Such agencies have existed elsewhere in Europe and the United States. This is the first in Italy.











            Sonia Spartá is one of the models. A 28-year-old from Sicily, she has heard adults whisper to children that she was from the circus when they saw the dark spots on her face and body, the result of a form of hyperpigmentation. While she once tried to conceal her condition, she now is conscious of her beauty. 

            “I changed things so that my weakness, or how I perceived a weakness, became my source of strength, my distinctiveness."" she said. 

            During a recent photo shoot in Rome, models of all shapes posed in underwear, wrapped in sheer organza. 

            “I feel like a revolutionary because I realize that around me all this did not exist before L’Imperfetta,” Giancane said. “It feels like a revolution, a battle to fight hard, because there are so many difficulties.”

            The agency counts more than 140 models. They are both in Italy and abroad, but it is focusing its work in Italy “because this is where we want to change things,"" Giancane said. Her models have appeared in advertising campaigns for cosmetic brands, fashion retailers and supermarkets. Much of the work is in online advertisements, but there have also been calls for models in television commercials. Two have appeared on the Milan fashion runway for designer Marco Rambaldi.

            Lucia Della Ratta, a university student in Rome, hid her albinism for most of her life, coloring her pale hair darker shades and using tanning lotions on her skin. Under the pandemic lockdown, she let her natural hair color grow out and began posting photos on Instagram. 

            “I felt beautiful for the first time,” Della Ratta, said during a break in the photo shoot. The shift still brings tears to her eyes, which she brushes away. “I felt it was my essence, as though it is me, as I really am.”

            Desireé D’Angelo has had alopecia since she was 10 years old. At school she wore a hat to hide the baldness, but bullying classmates would yank it off. At age 15, a dance teacher persuaded her to accept her condition and stop hiding it. 

            Since then, she has become a successful dancer, performer and model.

            “I like my body, I like my peculiarity. In the end, I have accepted it,” she said.ROME (AP) — A project on Instagram to highlight ordinary women and their imperfections has transformed into a modeling agency that aims to redefine notions of beauty in Italy.The Imperfetta (Imperfect) modeling agency, started in 2020 by Carlotta Giancane, has a casting book full of models who defy the industry’s pre-established standards of beauty.

HONG KONG SAR -  Media OutReach - 23 February 2023 -  The Mills is a landmark revitalisation project that transformed the Nan Fung Group's former textile mills into a creative and cultural destination for innovation, arts, culture, experiential learning, and retail. First announced in 2014 on the Group's 60th Anniversary, the revitalisation project was completed in 2018 and opened in the same year, and has since presented a large variety of arts and community events to inspire visitors and promote cultural vitality in Hong Kong. These, together with its wide selection of retail and dining outlets and a pet-friendly approach, have helped  The Mills reach its present position as one of Hong Kong's most vibrant, leisure and creative hubs for local culture lovers, hoping to inspire visitors from all walks of life to keep pace with the times.            To coincide with Hong Kong Arts Month in March,  CHAT (Centre for Heritage, Arts and Textile), one of the three pillars of  The Mills, is presenting an exquisite art exhibition titled  ""Clouds, Power, and Ornament - Roving Central Asia"" from February 25 to May 21, 2023. This is the first-ever thematic exhibition on Central Asian textile art in the Greater China region. It invites overseas visitors and interested locals to explore the fascinating and unique cultures of Central Asia through textile traditions, handcraft and contemporary art, and dive into how textiles serve as a medium for overcoming diversity and narrating socio-political landscapes.           Exploring Central Asia Through Textiles and Handicrafts During Hong Kong Arts Month in March        As an arts centre with a unique textile heritage,  CHAT encourages artists to explore contemporary art, design, and history through textiles, and unveil the captivating cultural stories behind the yarns. Central Asia is home to many culturally diverse and vibrant countries with fascinating socio-political histories. Traditional textile materials and techniques, such as ikat, felt, suzani, syrmak, together with their astonishing patterns, designs and matching ornaments all contribute to the uniquely distinctive textile culture of Central Asia. Age-old textile practices also permeate the many political economies and serve as mediums for social life within the region.   Co-curated by  CHAT's Wang Weiwei and other guest curators, the exhibition is divided into two main parts and features works by 26 art and cultural creators from Central Asia, presenting how artists and designers use textiles as a medium for cultural preservation, response, and cohesion.   The first part, ""Clouds and Power"", co-curated by  Slavs and Tatars and You Mi, uses traditional  ikat, a woven textile characterised by its elaborate and 'blurred' patterns, as a metaphor to present the views and intricacies of the region's political and social landscape.   The second part  ""Suture: Reimagining Ornaments"" is curated by  Alexandra Tsay and focuses on traditional Central Asian ornamentation, exploring it as a language that both reflects and shapes politics, society, and culture. Its attention to female artists also reveals important powers that have been concealed by mainstream narratives. At the exhibition, visitors can expect a diverse array of works, from a commissioned work in silk and felt adorned with traditional ornaments and motifs from Hong Kong and Kazakhstan, by Berlin-based Kazakh artist  Gulnur Mukazhanova, to Medina Bazargali & Kokonja's experimental juxtaposition of nomadic themes and yurts with VJ culture in contemporary Almaty, and more.   To provide a more comprehensive understanding of Central Asian Culture, CHAT has also prepared some electrifying performances and special artist-led workshops and talks for visitors to experience and be inspired. CHAT will also run a booth at  Art Basel Hong Kong (as one of its Cultural Partners) at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre from 21 to 25 March, to engage with visitors through talks and creative activities.   The Mills as the Latest Cultural Landmark: Inheriting History and Developing Cultural Power   In the 1950s and 1960s, Nan Fung Textiles was not only one of the most prolific yarn manufacturers in Hong Kong, but also a major denim supplier in Southeast Asia, bearing witness to the heyday of Hong Kong's textile industry. Following the revitalisation of the factories,  The Mills has retained and upcycled some of the original architectural features and relics from the former textile mills, such as the factory's signature red signage, the Golden Cup Gate at the entrance, and textile facilities of the past, to pay homage to the Group's heritage over the last half-century. The revitalisation project merged the three old textile mills into an open interior, connected by glass bridges, enabling visitors to freely explore different spaces.   Apart from CHAT,  The Mills is also composed of  The Mills Fabrica and  The Mills Shopfloor.  The Mills Fabrica is an incubator for start-ups and entrepreneurs that promote sustainable innovation in  techstyle (technology and lifestyle) and  agrifood tech. Last year, it extended its vision by revamping  Fabrica X into an innovative concept store, pioneering a new impact retail experience that combines retail, educational, and experiential elements to continue driving pursuits in sustainability.  The Mills Shopfloor is a hub for hands-on, interactive learning and experiential shopping, offering a platform for brands to showcase their products, while allowing visitors to learn about their brand and product stories.  CHAT is the first arts centre of its kind in Hong Kong, which organises a wide variety of textile-related arts and culture exhibitions and co-learning programmes to connect communities and inspire the exchange of thoughts and ideas.   In recent years,  The Mills has been actively collaborating with international brands and renowned artists from various sectors to promote innovative arts, cultural experiences, and sustainability. During Halloween in 2021, for example,  The Mills presented the  ""Immersive Journey of Junji Ito"", simulating scenes drawn from the creations of one of the world's most famous horror mangakas, to immerse visitors in a world of imagination and horror aesthetics.   In 2022,  The Mills teamed up with the famous British inflatable design group  Designs in Air to transform the property into a magical marine wonderland, featuring spooky inflatable monsters and their terrifying tentacles, which astonished visitors while raising awareness towards historic conservation in Hong Kong.   Last Christmas,  The Mills drew on its roots in textiles and fashion to collaborate with the international fashion brand  agnès b. and jointly crafted  ""The Dancing Cloak"". Weaving together recycled clothes and fabrics in the artwork, the festive décor and exhibition were premised on sustainability, with hopes of sparking green inspirations, promoting environmental awareness, while also echoing the heritage of  The Mills.   In addition to diverse happenings, exhibitions, and experiences,  The Mills itself is a work of art with many photogenic spots worth exploring. Welcoming visitors at the Pak Tin Par Lane entrance is a monolithic portrait, Unsung Hero, created by Portuguese artist Alexandre Farto as a tribute to former textile factory workers; walk along Pak Tin Par Lane to find hand-painted murals, created by six Hong Kong artists who depicted their vivid imaginations of  The Mills' past, present, and future in different styles. The Mills is also a site that evokes nostalgia—even the old staircase and the handcrafted, restored mosaic signage on the building's exterior are picture-worthy. Get set for your visit to  The Mills and enjoy immersive, diverse lifestyle and cultural experiences in the city's go-to creative and cultural hub.   Interested visitors can also join a  guided tour to discover how the former Nan Fung cotton-spinning factories were revitalised and reimagined into a creative cultural landmark that has transformed Tsuen Wan's textile past into a Techstyle future. The guided tour also covers the historical attractions of  The Mills and  CHAT's ""Welcome to the Spinning Factory"" exhibition. The tours are available every Saturday and Sunday, with multiple timeslots per day.   The Mills provides a shuttle bus service to and from Tsuen Wan MTR Station, and a free shuttle bus service from West Kowloon on designated days in late March. Further details will be announced soon.   Hashtag: #TheMills #CHAT

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819487,'We kill them all': Russian soldiers in Ukraine call home,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — How do people raised with a sense of right and wrong end up involved in terrible acts of violence against others?

            That’s the human mystery at the heart of 2,000 intercepted phone calls from Russian soldiers in Ukraine. These calls obtained by The Associated Press offer an intimate new perspective on Russian President Vladimir Putin’s year-old war, seen through the eyes of Russian soldiers themselves. 

            The AP identified calls made in March 2022 by soldiers in a military division that Ukrainian prosecutors say committed war crimes in Bucha, a town outside Kyiv that became an early symbol of Russian atrocities. 











            They show how deeply unprepared young soldiers — and their country — were for the war to come. Many joined the military because they needed money. They were told they’d be welcomed as heroes for liberating Ukraine from what Russian officials falsely claim are Nazi oppressors, and their Western backers, and that Kyiv would fall without bloodshed within a week. 

            The intercepts show that as soldiers realized how much they’d been misled, they grew more and more afraid. Violence that once would have been unthinkable became normal. Looting and drinking offered moments of rare reprieve. 

            They tell their mothers what this war actually looks like: About the teenage Ukrainian boy who got his ears cut off. How the scariest sound is not the whistle of a rocket flying past, but the silence that means it’s coming directly for you. How modern weapons can obliterate the human body so there’s nothing left to bring home.

            This is the story of one of those men, Leonid. The AP couldn't reach Leonid directly but did speak with his mother in Russia. The AP isn't using his full name to protect his family. The AP has no evidence of his individual actions beyond his own testimony.

            The AP verified these calls with the help of the Dossier Center, an investigative group in London funded by Russian dissident Mikhail Khodorkovsky. The conversations have been edited for length and clarity.

            ___

            In a joint production that airs on Saturday, Feb. 25, The Associated Press and Reveal at the Center for Investigative Reporting will broadcast never-before-heard audio of Russian soldiers at the front line of Putin’s war in Ukraine.

            ___

            LEONID 

            Leonid became a soldier because he needed money. In the calls, there is an obvious moral dissonance between the way Leonid’s mother raised him and what he is seeing and doing in Ukraine.  Still, she defended her son, insisting he never even came into contact with civilians in Ukraine.

            “No one thought it would be so terrible,” his mother told the AP in January. “My son just said one thing: ‘My conscience is clear. They opened fire first.’ That’s all.” 

            She declined to listen to any of the intercepts: “This is absurd,” she said. “Just don’t try to make it look like my child killed innocent people.”

            ___ 

            ONE: Kill if you don’t want to be killed.

            Leonid’s introduction to war came on Feb. 24, as his unit crossed into Ukraine from Belarus and decimated a detachment of Ukrainians at the border. After his first fight, Leonid seems to have compassion for the young Ukrainian soldiers they’d just killed. 

            Leonid: “We shot from the tanks, machine guns and rifles. We had no losses. We destroyed their four tanks. There were dead bodies lying around and burning. So, we won.”

            Mother: “Oh what a nightmare! Lyonka, you wanted to live at that moment, right honey?”

            Leonid: “More than ever!”

            Mother: “It’s totally horrible.”

            Leonid: “They were lying there, just 18 or 19 years old. Am I different from them? No, I’m not.”

            ___ 

            TWO: The rules of normal life no longer apply. 

            Unprepared for a prolonged attack, Russian soldiers ran short on basic supplies. One way for them to get what they needed — or wanted — was to steal. 

            When Leonid tells his mother casually about looting, at first she can’t believe he’s stealing. But it’s become normal for him.

            As he speaks, he watches a town burn on the horizon.

            “Such a beauty,” he says. 

            Leonid: “Look, mom, I’m looking at tons of houses — I don’t know, dozens, hundreds — and they’re all empty. Everyone ran away.”

            Mother: “So all the people left, right? You guys aren’t looting them, are you? You’re not going into other people’s houses?” 

            Leonid: “Of course we are, mom. Are you crazy?” 

            Mother: “Oh, you are. What do you take from there?” 

            Leonid: “We take food, bed linen, pillows. Blankets, forks, spoons, pans.” 

            Mother: (laughing) “You gotta be kidding me.” 

            Leonid: “Whoever doesn’t have any — socks, clean underwear, T-shirts, sweaters.”

            ___

            THREE: The enemy is everybody. 

            Leonid tells his mother about the terror of going on patrol and not knowing what or who they will encounter. He describes using lethal force at the slightest provocation against just about anyone.

            At first, she seems not to believe that Russian soldiers could be killing civilians.

            Leonid tells her that civilians were told to flee or shelter in basements, so anyone who was outside must not be a real civilian.

            This was a whole-of-society war. Mercy was for suckers.

            Mother: “Oh Lyonka, you’ve seen so much stuff there!”

            Leonid: “Well ... civilians are lying around right on the street with their brains coming out.”

            Mother: “Oh God, you mean the locals?”

            Leonid: “Yep. Well, like, yeah.”

            Mother: “Are they the ones you guys shot or the ones ... ”

            Leonid: “The ones killed by our army.” 

            Mother: “Lyonya, they might just be peaceful people.”

            Leonid: “Mom, there was a battle. And a guy would just pop up, you know? Maybe he would pull out a grenade launcher ... Or we had a case, a young guy was stopped, they took his cellphone. He had all this information about us in his Telegram messages — where to bomb, how many we were, how many tanks we have.""

            Mother: “So they knew everything?”

            Leonid: “He was shot right there on the spot.”

            Mother: “Mhm.”

            Leonid: “He was 17 years old. And that’s it, right there.”

            Mother: “Mhm.”

            Leonid: “There was a prisoner. It was an 18-year-old guy. First, he was shot in his leg. Then his ears were cut off. After that, he admitted everything, and they killed him.”

            Mother: “Did he admit it?”

            Leonid: “We don’t imprison them. I mean, we kill them all.”

            Mother: “Mhm.”

            ___ 

            FOUR: What it takes to get home alive.

            Leonid tells his mother he was nearly killed five times. Things are so disorganized, he says, it’s not uncommon for Russians to fire on their own troops. Some soldiers shoot themselves just to get medical leave, he says. 

            In another call, he tells his girlfriend that he's envious of his buddies who got shot in the feet and could go home. 

            “A bullet in your foot is like four months at home with crutches,” he says. “It would be awesome.”

            He promises to bring home a collection of bullets for the kids. “Trophies from Ukraine,” he calls them.

            His mother says she’s waiting for him.

            “Of course, you’ll come,” his mother says. “No doubts. You’re my beloved. Of course, you’ll come. You are my happiness.”

            Leonid returned to Russia in May, badly wounded, but alive. He told his mother Russia would win this war.

            ___

The country must adjust its thinking to meet the circumstances and quickly “beef up its preparations for war.”When asked about a potential invasion scenario, Chiu expressed his confidence that China would not be able to conquer Taiwan within a fortnight. “Taiwan can survive, as long as we are supplied,” said Chiu, indicating that allies could be counted on to supply Taiwan during such a conflict.He also warned that if military conflict begins, the entire island of Taiwan would become a warzone: “Once Taiwan is at war, there will be no front and no rear supply, it will all be one war zone ... there are many ways to get to the outside world, and there are also networks and communications that can break the blockade, and there are ways to survive if we can find the gaps.”He added the Chinese Communist Party would not be able to impose a dictatorship on Taiwan. “The people of Taiwan are used to freedom and democracy and cannot accept one-party rule,” said Chiu.The defense minister offered some thoughts on military philosophy in the interview. He said that although avoiding war is always preferable, it remains a soldier’s duty to rise to the occasion when conflict cannot be avoided. All troops must know that their responsibility is to ensure the survival of the country, said Chiu.The full interview can be found on the Commonwealth Magazine’s website in English and Mandarin.",2023/2/23,3094,Politics

While delegates are expected to discuss the economic effects of the war in Ukraine and possible debt relief for poorer nations, Russian sanctions and US tensions with China have already taken center stage.US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said ahead of talks, that sanctions imposed on Russia since it launched its invasion of Ukraine, were impacting Moscow significantly.""The way I see it, our sanctions have had a very significant negative effect on Russia so far. While by some measures the Russian economy has held up better than might initially have been expected, Russia is now running a significant budget deficit,"" Yellen said ahead of talks.Yellen went on to say that sanctions and export controls were making it ""extremely difficult"" for Russia to replenish ammunition stocks and ""repair 9,000 tanks that have been destroyed because of the war.""The US treasury secretary said despite President Vladimir Putin thinking victory would come ""at minimal cost,"" Yellen said that ""One year later Putin's war has been a strategic failure for the Kremlin.Yellen also addressed tense relations with China, saying that Washington and Beijing would resume dialog on economic matters ""at an appropriate time.""Yellen told reporters that communication between the two countries was important for ""the sake of the entire globe.""However she warned there would be consequences should Russian sanctions be violated.""We have made clear that providing material support to Russia or assistance with any type of systemic sanctions evasion would be a very serious concern to us,"" she said.""And we will certainly continue to make clear to the Chinese government and to companies and banks in their jurisdictions what the rules are regarding our sanctions and the serious consequences that they would face in violating them,"" Yellen saidThe comments on China come after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told US media over the weekend, that Washington had information that Beijing was considering providing ""lethal support"" to Moscow.Blinken said that this was something that would cause ""a very serious problem for us and our relationship.""China on Monday condemned claims by the US, saying that it was Washington who was ""endlessly shipping weapons to the battlefield,"" in an apparent reference to the US providing weapons to Ukraine.kb/rt (Reuters, AFP)",2023/2/23,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819512,European Commission bans TikTok from staff work devices,"The European Commission's IT service has asked all employees of the EU executive to uninstall Chinese-owned TikTok from their corporate devices, as well as the personal devices using corporate apps, citing data protection concerns.Internal Markets Commissioner Thierry Breton told reporters he had spoked to TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew about data privacy concerns about the video-sharing app.""We are extremely active...to make sure we are protecting our colleagues,"" he said.Officials received the request via email on Thursday morning, as reported initially by EURACTIV.""To protect the Commission's data and increase its cybersecurity, the EC (Euroepan Commission) Corporate Management Board has decided to suspend the TikTok application on corporate devices and personal devices enrolled in the Commission mobile device services,"" said the email.Staffers were asked to do so as soon as possible and no later than 15 March.TikTok responded by saying that a decision by the European Commission to ban the video-sharing app on its staff's official devices was based on mistaken ideas about its platform.""We are disappointed with this decision, which we believe to be misguided and based on fundamental misconceptions,"" a spokesperson for the Chinese-owned company said.TikTok, whose parent company ByteDance is Chinese, is already facing calls for a ban in the US over its links with Beijing, and is now under fierce scrutiny in the European Union.The bloc's top officials recently accused the platform of failing to deal with problems related to data, copyright and access to harmful content.Last November, TikTok admitted that the personal data of users worldwide could be accessed in the Chinese headquarters.  It was later forced to confirm that ByteDance staff had accessed TikTok data to track journalists in a bid to identify a source of leaks to the media.The company denies the Chinese government has any control or access.TikTok has recently been banned on government devices in the United States at the state and federal levels, and some lawmakers want to ban the platform entirely.Germany's Data Protection Commissioner Ulrich Kelber demanded on Wednesday that the federal government stop operating its Facebook page. Kelber justified his decision on doubts about the page fulfilling all data protection requirements.dh/rt (AFP, Reuters)",2023/2/23,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819513,Bird flu: Cambodia reports first fatality in years,"An 11-year-old girl in Cambodia's eastern Prey Veng province has died from bird flu, health authorities said.It is the country's first fatality from the virus in years.The girl fell ill on February 16 with a fever, cough and sore throat. She was sent to be treated at hospital in the capital, Phnom Penh. She was diagnosed on Wednesday and died shortly afterward, Cambodia's Communicable Disease Control Department said in a statement Wednesday.It did not specify the time of death, but said that test results confirmed that the girl was ""positive for H5N1"", referring to the bird flu virus. The disease typically spreads from birds to humans through direct contact.Health officials have taken samples from a dead wild bird at a conservation area near the girl's home, the Health Ministry said on Thursday. Cambodian Health Minister Mam Bunheng urged parents to keep their children away from poultry as well as sick or dead birds.Cambodia had 56 human cases of H5N1 from 2003 through 2014 and 37 of them were fatal, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).Since late 2021, Europe has been gripped by its worst-ever outbreak of bird flu, with North and South America also experiencing severe outbreaks. This has led to the culling of tens of millions of domestic poultry worldwide, many with the H5N1 strain.Brid flu, also known as avian influenza, normally spreads in poultry and wasn't deemed a threat to people until a 1997 outbreak among visitors to live poultry markets in Hong Kong.Most human cases worldwide have involved direct contact with infected poultry, but concerns have arisen recently about infections in a variety of mammals and the possibility the virus could evolve to spread more easily between people.Symptoms of H5N1 infection are similar to that of other flus, including cough, aches and fever, and in serious cases, patients can develop life-threatening pneumonia.WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus earlier this month expressed concern about avian influenza infections in mammals including minks, otters, foxes and sea lions.""H5N1 has spread widely in wild birds and poultry for 25 years, but the recent spillover to mammals needs to be monitored closely,'' he warned, stressing that ""for the moment, WHO assesses the risk to humans as low.""""But we cannot assume that will remain the case, and we must prepare for any change in the status quo,"" Ghebreyesus said.Globally, there have been more than 450 fatal bird flu cases since 2003, according to the WHO.dh/rt (AP, AFP)",2023/2/23,477,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819514,OSCE meets in Vienna amid protests at Russian participation,"The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) will hold a parliamentary session in Vienna over the next two days, involving lawmakers from 57 member states.The session — which falls on the one year anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine — has caused controversy due to the  attendance of a Russian delegation.Involvement from Moscow has led to Ukrainian and Lithuanian lawmakers deciding to boycott meetings in protest.""They (Russians) are not interested in discussion, dialogue. They are coming only for propaganda,"" Ukraine delegation head Mykyta Poturaiev told reporters on Wednesday.""It is unacceptable to have in common meetings people who are responsible, who voted for this war,"" he added.Lithuania’s permanent representative for international organisations, including the OSCE, Vaidotas Verba, told DW that the parliamentarians deem the meeting to be “morally and politically inappropriate”.He said: ""Our members of parliament consider it to be morally and politically inappropriate to sit in the same room with the people who helped to start this war, promoting (it) and now supporting the harsh measures against defenders of Ukraine.""The Russian delegation should not be ""discussing Ukraine and the first anniversary of this terrible war,"" added Verba, whose role is separate from the decision met by the Lithuanian delegation.Nineteen other countries protested the attendance of the Russian lawmakers in a letter sent to the Austrian government in early February.Austria said it would not bar the Russian delegation due to its obligations ""under international law,"" as the OSCE has its headquarters in Vienna.""The date is very unfortunate,"" Austria's Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg conceded in an interview with broadcaster ORF.""But at the same time, we must not disregard the fact that we need platforms. The OSCE has never been an organisation of like-minded people,"" he added.The Russian delegation is being led by deputy chair of the Russian Duma's lower house, Pyotr Tolstoy, who is currently under international sanctions.Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer is among the few Western leaders who has met with Russian President Vladimir Putin since the invasion, which he said has been an attempt to push for an end to the conflict.President of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly, Margareta Cederfelt, said the meeting would not become a platform for Russian propaganda.""For the privilege of having a few minutes to spout their lies, the Russian delegates will have to sit through hours upon hours of vocal denunciations of their actions,"" Cedarfelt said in a statement issued on Tuesday.Previously, the UK and Poland refused to issue visas to the Russian delegation when they hosted sessions last year, with the pair being among Europe's toughest critics of Moscow since the Russian invasion of Ukraine .kb/rt (dpa, AFP)",2023/2/23,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819515,Turkey earthquake: How are the true costs calculated?,"A report published by the Turkish Enterprise and Business Confederation has put the cost of the earthquake in eastern Turkey at $84 billion (€80 billion), about 10% of Turkey's gross domestic product. About $70.8 billion is from the damage to homes, $10.4 billion from the loss of national income and $2.9 billion from the loss of working days.US data analytics firm Verisk put the economic losses at a minimum of $20 billion, while several other estimates lie in between. Assessing the damage caused by the earthquake in Syria will likely take longer. The scale of destruction may be of a similar magnitude but result in a far lower cost.DW looks at how these earthquake calculations are made and explores why the estimates vary so much.There are generally two approaches to calculating the economic effects of such disasters, according to Melanie Gall from Arizona State University's Spatial Hazards Events and Losses Database for the United States (SHELDUS).One is direct impacts, that is those immediately caused by the event such as damage to homes and injuries. Direct losses may be assessed by professional assessors hired by insurance companies, Gall told DW.Indirect impacts are those that emanate from secondary or tertiary effects such as business losses during shutdowns, loss of income for workers, and people suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) — a mental condition that is triggered by a terrifying event. Such losses are usually calculated using economic models.""For most events, these estimates are ballparked and do not come from professional estimators,"" Gall said.Insurance companies and insurance trade associations typically make the first estimates, which focus on property damage. Insurers base these estimates on losses covered by insurance and then extrapolate them to include losses related to noninsured property.Adam Rose, a senior research fellow at the Center for Risk and Economic Analysis of Threats and Emergencies at the University of Southern California makes such estimates. He leads a team that developed software for the purpose called Economic Consequence Analysis Tool, or E-CAT.""Precise estimates of the cost of a given disaster can only be determined after a careful case study, which takes months or years to complete,"" Rose told DW.Rose's software can be used once some basic information on the initial size of the disaster and rough estimates of the extent of resilience and behavioral responses become available.""An issue here is valuing human life, which typically includes a large portion related to a person's earnings. These are lower in developing countries like Turkey, so sometimes translating distant injuries into dollars becomes problematic in those contexts,"" said Rose.Categories evaluated are business interruption, the decrease in economic activity measured either in terms of lost revenue, or a combination of lost wages and profits as well as personal income or employment at the macroeconomic level.""The above three categories do not include human misery, such as the number of people left without power or clean water,"" Rose added.John Bateman, public affairs officer at the NOAA Satellite and Information Service in the US, also says that many costs are simply not counted.These would include losses to natural capital or environmental degradation, mental or physical health care related costs and the value of a lost supply chain""Therefore, our estimates should be considered conservative with respect to what is truly lost,"" he told DW.According to Rose, the earliest estimates of a disaster's cost are often made within a few days, but they subsequently get refined as more data becomes available. ""These initial estimates often omit damaged infrastructure, such as roads, bridges and utilities.""There is however a way analysts can also estimate those losses, Rose noted. They need to study and refine data collected by satellites and reconnaissance airplanes through a process called Earth observation. In addition, three more factors need to be considered, he said.The first pertains to the multiplier effects that reverberate through supply chains. For example, earthquakes in Taiwan have in the past damaged semiconductor factories, disrupting the production of electronics in the US and elsewhere.The second is how quickly and efficiently businesses get back on their feet after a disaster by relying on strategies such as relocating or consuming less water and power. Disaster recovery experts refer to this way of reducing the risks associated with a disaster's aftermath as ""resilience.""The third has to do with what happens to people who live in disaster zones. If they flee the area on their own or after being forced to do so by government evacuation orders, the local economy loses its labor base, and demand for goods and services in the area declines. This also happens in cases like Turkey when people are afraid to return to work in buildings they believe rightly or wrongly to be vulnerable to collapse.Rose pointed out that the cost estimates for natural disasters are often either ""overestimated or underestimated by politics.""""While some suspect they are exaggerated in order to receive more aid and compensation, others suspect that governments underestimate costs to avoid embarrassment when a government or business policy may be at fault.""The insurer Swiss Re has found that the long-term development impacts of catastrophes usually depend on how direct losses lead to indirect and secondary costs and these depend on the country's economic capacity to absorb losses.Research over the past 30 years has shown that it is generally the poor who tend to suffer more from disasters. Impoverished people are more likely to live in hazard-exposed areas and are less able to invest in risk-reducing measures. Poverty is both a cause and consequence of disaster risk.According to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, weak governance, growing poverty, biodiversity loss, collapsing ecosystems and unplanned rapid urbanization are all ""interconnected drivers of disaster risk.""""And when disaster strikes, weak health systems and infrastructure leave them even more vulnerable. Decades of development gains can be wiped out in an instant,"" Guterres said late last year on the International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction.Edited by: Uwe Hessler",2023/2/23,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819516,Ukraine's Yaroslava Mahuckikh: 'The most difficult year of my life',"Yaroslava Mahuchikh had a simple answer when DW asked about her aspirations for 2023 during a conversation last month.""My goal for this year is not crying,"" the Ukrainian high jumper responded with a laugh.After what she called ""the most difficult year of her life"" amid Russia's invasion of her country, Mahuchikh, 21, is back to doing what she does best. The Olympic bronze medalist from Tokyo 2021 has yet to lose an indoor high jump competition this year and is the only woman in 2023 to clear 2.0 meters (6 feet, 7 inches) multiple times.Most importantly of all, she is representing her country when Ukraine needs representation most.The year 2022 was both the best and the worst year of Mahuchikh's life.It was a year where she won a gold medal at the World Indoor Championships in Belgrade, Serbia, a silver medal at the World Championships in Eugene, Oregon and another gold at the European Championships in Munich, Germany.It was a year where she jumped an outdoor personal best of 2.05 meters at a Diamond League meet in Brussels, Belgium, attempted a world record 2.10 meters and earned a nomination for World Athletics Female Athlete of the Year.But it was also a year that saw her home city of Dnipro bombarded with Russian rockets, a year in which she spent a majority living and training away from home, separated from loved ones.Mahuchikh was in Dnipro when the war began and, after staying briefly with her coach, Tatyana Stepanova, in the nearby town of Sukhachivka, both traveled three days by car to Belgrade, Serbia, arriving a week before the Indoor Championships.""All Ukrainian people will remember the day, February 24, when the war started, when Russia came to our territory,"" Mahuchikh told DW.""I think about my journey to the World Championship indoor one week before competition. We did this long journey to compete and we had a great season.""As an Olympian, Mahuchikh had lots of experience representing her country on an international stage, but when Russia invaded her country, she seized an opportunity to proudly stand for her people.When she competes, Mahuchikh often sports blue and yellow eyeliner during competitions. She also speaks openly and assertively when asked about the war back home.""I understand that I am an ambassador for Ukraine,"" Mahuchikh said. ""For me, it's nice that I can do this, that I can speak with journalists and show that Ukrainian people never give up.""The strength she has portrayed has also come with a dose of vulnerability. Stepanova, who coaches Mahuchikh as well as another top high jumper Iryna Gerashchenko, admitted that, though they remain strong, the war has made its impact.""It is very hard to bear, but we manage,"" Stepanova told DW. ""We are a strong nation. We want to show that we can win -- not only in sports, but also in the war.""When Mahuchikh left Dnipro shortly after the war began, she was unsure when she would be able to return to the city, located in central Ukraine.She spent most of the year in Erlangen — a town just north of Nuremberg in Gemany — in housing set up by her sponsor Puma.In December, after 10 months abroad, Mahuchikh, Stepanova and others were finally able to return home over the New Year's holiday. Mahuchikh especially remembers how happy she was to see the Dnipro railway station.""I went to the city smiling because my mind needed it to give me energy,"" Mahuchikh said. ""To be at home, it's the best way to recover.""Her mother, sister and niece had joined her in Germany, but her father and grandmother remained in Ukraine. Even with occasional video calls on her cellphone, being apart took it's toll, and she relished finally being able to reunite with them.""It was really difficult. Sometimes I cried in the room,"" Mahuchikh admitted. ""When I went to Dnipro, I hugged my father, I hugged my grandmother, and ..."" She paused and touched her chest ""... in the heart, really.""Mahuchikh was once again able to train at home with Stepanova, and in early January the two traveled to Lviv where Mahuchikh opened her indoor season, jumping a world-leading 2.02 meters.""It was better to prepare at home,"" Stepanova said. ""Yaroslava trained there with sparks in her eyes. It is very difficult to wander all over the world, living sometimes in one house, sometimes in another.""But despite the warm homecoming, the war was never too far. On the day of the competition in Lviv, a Russian air strike hit a multi-storey building in Dnipro, killing 46 people and injuring 80 more -- 11 people are still considered missing.Now based in Belgium, Mahuchikh is happy to be competing again and, though the Paris Olympics are still more than a year away, she has a lot to look forward to, most notably the World Championships in Belgrade in August.It remains unclear whether she will compete alongside Russian and Belarusian athletes, with the International Olympic Committee yet to decide their fate after recommending a blanket ban last year. Early in her career, she developed a rivalry with Russia's Mariya Lasitskene, who won gold in high jump in Tokyo.Mahuchikh told DW that she has no contact with Russian athletes and is firmly against them competing while the war continues.""They died for me, really. They don't exist in my life like before since Febraury 24,"" she said. ""Ukrainian athletes and Ukrainian sportspeople will do everything possible so that Belarusian and Russian athletes don't compete internationally because Russia is a terrorist state.""Stepanova admitted that she didn't really speak with her Russian and Belursian counterparts before the war but does not want to speak with them now. ""I don't think I'll even look their way after what they've done.""Mahuchikh said another goal she has this year is one she shares with all Ukrainian people: ""The end of the war and [our country] winning.""Maksym Drabok contributed to this report.Edited by: James Thorogood",2023/2/23,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819517,World Cup 2023: Colin Bell plotting to upset adopted homeland,"Colin Bell, head coach of South Korea's national women's soccer team, always knew this international break would be tough. That, to a large extent, was the point. His South Korea side lost all three games of a Women's World Cup warmup tournament in England over the last week.Given that all but three of his 26-woman South Korean squad play their football in the domestic WK League and he's missing some key players, Bell knew his side would be at a disadvantage even before defeats by England, Belgium and Italy in the Arnold Clark Cup.But in order to succeed in a World Cup group that includes Germany this July and August, he needs his players to be able to work at maximum capacity. It's something he doesn't think most of them get on a weekly basis.""There are major difficulties as to the intensity of the [WK League] football,"" he told DW.""In Korea, the league is too slow, the intensity is not high enough. And when they come into international football, then we train totally differently. We play at a high level, and the girls are quite capable of doing it. That makes it a little bit frustrating for me when I see how they can play, and then we see how they play in the league.""There's just too big a difference, unfortunately.""Addressing that lack of intensity was the first thing on Bell's list when he took over South Korea after the 2019 World Cup.After two years coaching the Republic of Ireland and then a short stint assisting at English men's club Huddersfield Town, the English coach, who won the Champions League with FFC (now Eintracht) Frankfurt in 2015, saw a chance to build a team in his image. One forged in 30 years as a player and coach in Germany.""The German influence on my way of thinking about football and the way of working has had a tremendous effect on me,"" he said.""That German mentality of going on to the pitch expecting to win, not even having to play well but still expecting to win. For me, it's a kind of positive arrogance that I like. And so I've kept that, and I take that into all of my teams, whether in Germany or Norway, in Ireland or now in Korea. I try to instill that belief.""Bell is well traveled and can already communicate with his players in Korean for the most part. But aside from star players like Ji So-yun, who won multiple titles with Chelsea before returning home last year, and Spurs' midfielder Cho So-hyun, his squad have less international experience.The 61-year-old thinks there may be some benefit to some players looking abroad.""It's always a question of each individual player, what they want, where they want to go and take their own careers. Korea is a great place to live, so I can't blame anybody for wanting to stay there,"" he said.""But it would be good for some of them, for sure. An adventure and maybe a career change to be playing at a high intensity regularly and playing in leagues where it's real competition, where you can get relegated for example. In Korea there's no pressure really. If you finish last, you finish last, but you're still going to be in the league next season.""So-hyun shared similar sentiments in an interview with the soccer website Goal last year: ""For self-improvement, I recommend [South Korean players] to go to European leagues. I'm not saying that Asian players are not good at playing soccer, but to improve their skills and their physical [abilities], I think it's much better to go and play and experience a team abroad.""That's what Bell did as a player, appearing for then Bundesliga 2 side Mainz, then coaching a host of men's and women's teams in Germany before his crowning glory at FFC Frankfurt.Bell believes the women's Bundesliga has taken a ""bit of a dip” in recent years, but he is only too aware of the wealth of talent that will be available to his opposite number in the dugout, Martina Voss-Tecklenburg, when South Korea face Germany in the final game of Group H on August 3 in the Australian city of Brisbane.Bell coached several of Germany's current squad during his time in the country, and tried to make Linda Dallmann the first Bundesliga player to move for a transfer fee while he was at Frankfurt. He's also followed many of the younger generation from their early days.""I've always been a big fan of Linda. But also, Lina Magull. I remember seeing her play for Germany under-15s, Lea Schuller too and then there's Guilia Gwinn, who's unfortunately injured at the moment. So you've got that new group of younger players that have really improved and did very well last year at the Euros. That final could've gone either way.""I think I can relate to them easier and faster than the other opponents. But in saying that, of course, it's going to be a massive task, because I know how good they are. But it's an interesting group. Our focus is more on Colombia and Morocco though. Because if we can beat both of them, then then we're through to the next round.""Should Bell succeed in that aim, it'll be only the second time South Korea have made it beyond the group stage.Ranked at 15 in the world, winning those two games and qualifying doesn't look a task that's beyond them.But, even if both teams are through, Germany vs. South Korea won't be a dead rubber for Colin Bell.Edited by: Matt Ford",2023/2/23,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819518,Ukraine updates: Putin threatens to boost nuclear forces,"Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday spoke of maintaining increased attention to strengthening Moscow's nuclear forces.Putin's remarks were issued by the Kremlin to mark Thursday's Defender of the Fatherland public holiday. They came two days after he announced that Russia would suspend its participation in a key nuclear disarmament treaty.""As before, we will pay increased attention to strengthening the nuclear triad,"" Putin said, referring to nuclear missiles on land, sea and air.He added that the Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missiles, which are able to carry multiple nuclear warheads, would be deployed this year.

While by some measures the Russian economy has held up better than might initially have been expected, Russia is now running a significant budget deficit,"" she said.Yellen told reporters that Moscow was ""finding it extremely difficult"" to get the material it needed to replenish its munitions and repair 9,000 tanks that were destroyed in the war.""Russia is running down its holdings in its sovereign wealth fund so... the price cap that we have put on Russian oil is clearly substantially reducing Russia's revenues,"" she said.Sanctions against Russia have proved to be challenging for the Russian economy, but it has performed far better than expected.Although the Kremlin made a lot of key economic data classified after it launched the war on Ukraine, the collapse many predicted has seemingly not materialized.Russia's official statistics agency has said the economy had contracted by 2.1% in 2022, having predicted a contraction of 12%.The British Defense Ministry said in its regular intelligence update that Russian forces were likely preparing to attack the Donetsk town of Vuhledar, in eastern Ukraine.The report said the town has experienced heavy shelling recently, noting that Russia suffered ""costly failed attacks"" in the area in early February and late 2022.It added that the Russian commander who is likely responsible for the Vuhledar operation, Colonel General Rustam Muradov, ""is likely under intense pressure to improve results following harsh criticism from the Russian nationalist community after previous setbacks.""However, it is unlikely that Muradov has a striking force capable of achieving a breakthrough.""Yevgeny Prigozhin, who leads the Wagner Group of mercenaries, said that his fighters were set to receive additional supplies of ammunition""Today at 6 a.m., it was announced that the shipment of ammunition has started,"" Prigozhin said in a statement on Telegram.""Most likely, the ball is now rolling. So far, it's all on paper, but, as we were told, the principal documents have already been signed.""Earlier this week, Prigozhin had accused Russia's defense minister of ""treason,"" claiming that the military bosses had denied Wagner ammunition out of personal spite to him.But on Thursday, he wrote: ""Many thanks to those who acted various ways — to those ordinary citizens who did everything they could, and to those, including those in high offices, who exerted pressure and made decisions ... so that they began to give us ammunition.""Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has arrived in the Ukrainian capital in a show of support before of the one-year anniversary of Russia's war in Ukraine.""Returning to Kyiv today, one year since the start of the war,"" Sanchez tweeted with a video of him stepping off the train in Kyiv. ""We will stand with Ukraine and its people until peace returns to Europe,"" he wrote in Spanish and Ukrainian.Sanchez is due to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.Spanish Defense Minister Margarita Robles had confirmed a day earlier that Madrid would deliver six of its German-made Leopard tanks to Ukraine.Moscow has accused Kyiv of planning to invade Transnistria, a Moldovan breakaway region bordering Ukraine. The Moldovan government denied the claims via its Telegram channel and urged its citizens to remain calm.Russian media quoted Russia's Defense Ministry as saying that Ukraine would try to carry out an armed operation ""under a false flag"" in Transnistria in the near future.The ministry also claimed that the Ukrainian Azov Regiment was planning to use a pretext for the invasion by on staging an by alleged Russian forces.Moscow did not provide any evidence backing its allegations, but said it was ready to respond to any change on the border between Ukraine and Transnistria.Russian troops have been stationed in Transnistria since the 1990s.Moldova accused Russia in December of planning to invade its territory. Sergey Lavrov, Russia's foreign minister, recently warned that Moldova could meet the same fate as Ukraine.Lawmakers from member countries of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) are holding a two-day meeting that is set to focus on the war in Ukraine.The gathering of around 300 parliamentarians comes as Russia's invasion of Ukraine enters one year.Ukraine and Lithuania are boycotting the meetings to protest the attendance of Russian delegates.Margareta Cederfelt, president of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly, has said the summit would not become a platform for Russia's propaganda.Yevgeny Prigozhin has admitted to leading the Wagner Group of mercenaries and a massive internet troll farm.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819519,"Pope cancels an appointment, some speeches due to bad cold","ROME (AP) — Pope Francis canceled one audience and skipped speeches he was set to deliver Thursday because of a bad cold, the Vatican said.

            Francis, 86, did meet with young Orthodox priests and monks and members of the Max Planck Society, the German research organization that is celebrating its 75th anniversary this year. But because of a “bad cold,” Francis merely had printed copies of his remarks handed out and didn't read them aloud, the Vatican said in a note.

            He later canceled a planned audience with members of an Italian YMCA group, the Holy See said in its daily bulletin.











            On Wednesday, Francis coughed repeatedly during Ash Wednesday services that he presided over at a Roman church, and opted not to participate in the traditional procession that inaugurates the church's Lenten season.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819520,British soccer commentator John Motson dies at 77,"John Motson, the BBC soccer commentator who was one of the most well-known voices in British sport for 50 years, has died. He was 77.

            The BBC announced the death of Motson on Thursday, without giving any details.

            Fondly referred to as “Motty,” Motson called games for Britain's national broadcaster from 1968-2018, covering 10 World Cups, 10 European Championships and 29 FA Cup finals.











            He commentated on almost 2,500 televised games, the BBC said, before retiring at the end of the 2017-18 Premier League.

            Motson was known for his passion and knowledge of soccer, and was synonymous with wearing a sheepskin coat in the commentary box.

            “A quite brilliant commentator,” said Gary Lineker, the former England captain who works for the BBC as the presenter of its flagship soccer show, Match of the Day, ""and the voice of football in this country for generations.

            “He’ll be very much missed. RIP Motty.”

            Tim Davie, the BBC director-general, described Motson as a ""legendary figure in British sports broadcasting, respected by those in the game, loved by fans and an inspiration to those who followed him in the commentary box.”

            “Like all the greats behind the mic,"" Davie said, “John had the right words, at the right time, for all the big moments.”

            Motson started as a newspaper reporter before joining the BBC in 1968 as a radio sports presenter.

            His big break came in 1972 when, on trial as a fledgling commentator, he was asked to call an FA Cup match between Hereford, which played in England's non-leagues, and first-division Newcastle.

            It was supposed to be a formality — Newcastle was the heavy favorite — but Hereford won after extra time on a muddy field at Edgar Street. Hereford's equalizer, a long-range shot by Ronnie Radford, has gone down as one of the most famous goals in English soccer and Motson's commentary on it became iconic.

            “If Ronnie hadn’t scored that goal and Hereford had not beaten Newcastle, I don’t think I would be here talking to you now,” Motson said as he reflected back on his career before retirement. 

            “It changed my life, in the sense I was on trial that year at the BBC, I hadn’t got a contract at that stage. I had been in radio, and they kind of borrowed me for a year if you like to see if I made out.""

            Among his most famous one-liners on commentary was his remark at fulltime of Wimbledon's shocking 1-0 win over Liverpool in the FA Cup final in 1988.

            “The crazy gang have beaten the culture club,” Motson said.

            Motson was the commentator on the FA Cup semifinal between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough in 1989, during which there was a crush that led to the death of 97 Liverpool fans. Motson went on to give evidence at the inquest.

            In 2001, Motson received an OBE (Order of the British Empire) for services to sports broadcasting.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819522,Could Nigeria’s cash shortage hurt the presidential vote?,"ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — Voters in Nigeria will elect a new leader Saturday after President Muhammadu Buhari's final term ends, with 18 candidates vying to lead a country facing a series of struggles — the newest and most pressing being a shortage of cash.

            
                Three front-runners have emerged, including the ruling party’s Bola Tinubu and the main opposition’s Atiku Abubakar. Peter Obi, a third-party hopeful who has been favored in most polls, has broken the usual cycle of two-candidate races.

            Despite a steady decline in voter turnout, political analysts had projected a high level of participation in this election. But standing in the way is the shortage in the supply of cash.











            People are forced to wait all day in lines at ATMs in the cash-reliant country, leaving many only able to buy basics like food and stirring violence. It threatens to dampen voter turnout and interfere with independent groups' ability to oversee the race.

            Here are things to know about the cash crisis in Africa’s largest economy and how it could affect the election:

            WHY IS THERE A CASH SHORTAGE IN NIGERIA?

            Authorities are struggling to replace Nigeria's old currency with new notes, the first time in nearly 20 years that the naira is being redesigned. As a result, many people have been unable to withdraw their money from banks. 

            The currency changeover is meant to curb inflation and money laundering, with people holding more than 80% of all money in circulation as of November, when the central bank introduced the policy. Policymakers also said it was supposed to limit the use of cash to buy votes, a common trend in Nigeria’s elections.

            But the fast timeline of the currency swap has led to a very limited supply of the new notes.

            In the absence of cash, many people have turned to digital payment services that are usually unreliable. 

            In Nigeria’s capital city of Abuja, trader Felix Okpe said he had not been credited more than 24 hours after someone bought 15,000 naira ($32) worth of items from his hair products shop.

            “It is affecting us (because) does anyone still have the cash to buy things? It has put everybody into confusion,” Okpe said.

            WHAT HAS BEEN DONE TO EASE THE CRISIS?

            The central bank says the state-run company that is printing money has capacity to create enough banknotes but has accused politicians of hoarding the money for their own use and to influence the election.

            Analysts disagree, accusing the bank of not adequately planning the currency swap.

            Larger-domination 1,000 naira ($2.16), 500 naira ($1.08) and 200 naira (43 U.S. cents) notes are being switched out with redesigned cash. Buhari, the president, has directed that the 200 naira notes can be used until April 10, but they have always been scarce and rarely used.

            His order appears to have contradicted a supreme court directive that the old currency notes should remain in use pending its final decision. 

            Central bank spokesman Osita Nwanisobi insisted Tuesday that only the 200 naira notes will stay in use but didn't offer details on efforts to ramp up the supply of cash to banks.

            HOW WILL THIS AFFECT THE ELECTION?

            Nearly 200 local and international observer groups with 145,000 members will monitor the presidential and state elections. Some have complained of not being able to deploy staffers in all 36 Nigerian states and the capital because paying for services has become difficult.

            Hassan Idayat, who leads the Center for Democracy and Development, Nigeria’s largest democracy-focused group, said the lack of access to cash has slowed down preparations for election monitoring because workers have been left stranded.

            ""It is impacting our own planning as an organization. In some parts of the country, we have to pay cash to people we are working with. It becomes really impossible for us to work without cash,"" she said. “It is a bad situation.”

            The limited capacity of observer groups to monitor the vote could lead to irregularities that often leave Nigeria’s elections deeply contested, she said.

            There are concerns the cash crisis could lead to a delay in the vote if the election commission can't handle logistics like paying workers on time — a possible replay of 2019 when logistical challenges postponed the election. The one before that — in 2015 — also was pushed back.

            HOW IS THE CASH SHORTAGE WORSENING NIGERIA'S PROBLEMS?

            The currency crisis has led to incessant attacks on banks and forced many businesses to close as more people prioritize buying food with the little money they have. 

            Security analysts say this brings an extra burden for security forces, who are overstretched as they respond to separatist violence in southeast Nigeria, an extremist insurgency in the northeast and armed groups of former herdsmen fighting communities over access to water and land in the northwest.

            The cash crisis has decreased interest in the presidential election, dampening hopes of increased voter participation after years of steady decline. 

            Many voters in Nigeria don't participate in elections because they “have lost faith in government and they don’t feel voting would change the quality of leadership,” said Cynthia Mbamalu with YIAGA Africa, a nonprofit promoting electoral reforms in Nigeria.

            WHY IS THE ELECTION IMPORTANT?

            It is a high-stakes vote not just for Nigeria but also for its West African neighbors in a politically unstable region stemming from an unusual high rate of military coups. 

            This is Nigeria's seventh election since 1999, when it left military rule, making this the longest uninterrupted democratic period. But security and economic challenges are growing: Thousands have been killed by armed groups in the last year, while many have been pushed into poverty because of surging inflation and endemic corruption.

            The front-runners — 70-year-old Tinubu from the ruling All Progressives Congress, 76-year-old Atiku from the main opposition People's Democratic Party and 61-year-old Obi from the Labour Party — have forged their campaigns on promises to fix these problems.

            “Nigeria needs to get it right this time, both in the presidential and governorship elections,” said Ayisha Osori, a director of the Open Society Initiative for West Africa. “It is a giant that has never been quite stable.”ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — Voters in Nigeria will elect a new leader Saturday after President Muhammadu Buhari's final term ends, with 18 candidates vying to lead a country facing a series of struggles — the newest and most pressing being a shortage of cash.Three front-runners have emerged, including the ruling party’s Bola Tinubu and the main opposition’s Atiku Abubakar.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819523,Ukraine shuns OSCE gathering in Vienna over Russian presence,"VIENNA (AP) — A meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe's parliamentary assembly got underway Thursday without the Ukrainian delegation, which described the presence of Russian lawmakers as “an affront.”

            The two-day meeting of the normally low-profile assembly is coinciding with the anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The attendance of the Russian lawmakers has overshadowed the event. Austria granted them visas even though they are under European Union sanctions and despite protests from 20 countries including Britain, France and Canada. 

            Austria's government said that as host nation it was obliged to grant visas to representatives from all OSCE member nations. Ukraine said its delegates wouldn't attend if the Russians were present, as did Lithuania.











            The Vienna-based OSCE, whose 57 members include both Ukraine and Russia, was created during the Cold War as a platform for dialogue between East and West. 

            The group has a wide-ranging mission, including peace, human rights, arms control and other security issues. 

            Austria had a “duty not to slam the door on diplomacy,” Wolfgang Sobotka, the speaker of the Austrian parliament said. “The OSCE, with its inclusive approach and comprehensive security concept, can and above all should be part of a solution to this conflict.”

            “I do sympathize with the fact that some members find it unbearable to sit in the same room as the aggressors,” the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly's president, Margareta Cederfelt, told the opening session. “But for those present today, this is your opportunity to stand up for Ukraine and to confront the lies from the aggressors.”

            A Slovak delegate read out a statement from the Ukrainian delegation that said “the presence of these warmongers in Vienna is an affront to everything that the OSCE stands for.”

            “They are not here for genuine dialogue nor for cooperation,” it added. “They are here to spread their propaganda ... they are here to try and justify the war crimes they have committed and desecrate the principles of international law and human decency.” 

            During the session, some delegates walked out as Russian lawmakers spoke.

            Later Thursday, the head of the U.S. delegation, Sen. Ben Cardin, told reporters in Vienna that the delegation supported excluding the Russians from the meeting. 

            “We strongly believe that the Russian parliamentarians, all of whom have been sanctioned by the United States, the six that are here, should not have been permitted visas to come to this meeting,"" Cardin said.

            The Democratic senator from Maryland said he thought Ukraine's supporters nonetheless “have strongly isolated Russia at this meeting."" 

            ""The debate that took place this morning and will continue through tomorrow has made it clear that Russia must be held accountable for the atrocities that they have committed,” Cardin added.

            The head of the Ukrainian delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly, Mykyta Poturaiev, said during a joint press conference with Cardin that his country has drafted an amendment stating that any OSCE country that starts a war against another member should be suspended from the group.

            Referring to Russia's brutal war in Ukraine, Poturaiev said: ""Let’s not forget that in Ukraine they’re killing every day the elderly, men, women, children, kids, newly born and even unborn, because a lot of Ukrainian pregnant women were killed together with their unborn children.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819540,German energy boss warns: Don't let guard down on gas supply,"BONN, Germany (AP) — The temperature outside Klaus Mueller's office almost resembles spring, exactly the kind of mild weather that helped Germany get through the winter without Russian natural gas. 

            But Germany's chief utility regulator is not ready to sound the all clear on an energy crisis spawned by the war in Ukraine, even with natural gas reserves abundant and prices well down from their peak. 

            Too much could go wrong — especially if consumers and companies grow weary of the conservation habits they learned during a winter fraught with fear of rolling blackouts and rationing, Mueller, head of the Federal Network Agency, said in an interview Wednesday with The Associated Press.











            Plus, there's next winter to think about.

            Other risks, such as a pipeline accident or a sudden cold snap, could set back plans to keep natural gas storage as full as possible as Europe learns to live without the cheap Russian gas that fueled its economy for decades. 

            Mueller would only concede that he's “optimistic” this winter will end without a further gas crunch, especially after Germany cut gas use by 14% in 2022 through lowering thermostats, switching to other fuels or halting energy-intensive industrial production. Gas use fell 19% in the last six months across the whole 27-nation European Union.

            “But at the same time, we're focused already on winter 2023-24, and we know that Germany, and large parts of Europe, will have to get through the next winter without Russian pipeline gas,"" he said. And “the risks are in plain sight.”

            While he's thankful for warmer-than-usual winter weather that cut gas use for heating, “will next winter be so mild? No one can say,"" Mueller said. 

            “Second, we have to see if the industrial firms and private households are tired of the efforts related to conservation — or will they redouble their efforts based on experience thus far? We're pushing for the second to be the case,” he said. 

            Mueller says he hopes the public responds to an approach based on transparency — not exaggerating risk but not sugarcoating it either. Yet the experience with measures such as masking and social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic show “that always being told what to do is not especially popular.” 

            Key for the months and years ahead is a push to use heat pumps instead of gas heating, still the case in roughly half of German homes. Above all, higher prices will force homeowners and businesses to adapt simply to lower their costs. 

            Gas prices have fallen to under 50 euros ($53) per megawatt hour — the lowest level in nearly a year and a half — from a record 350 euros per megawatt hour in August, according to FactSet. But they are still well above the 18 euros per megawatt hour in March 2021, just before Russia started massing troops on Ukraine's border. 

            Mueller said it will take six months to a year for lower prices to filter through to less expensive utility bills for consumers. Asked whether prices two or three times their pre-crisis level are the “new normal,"" Mueller avoided the phrase, saying there are too many uncertainties that could affect gas prices going forward. 

            Mueller, formerly head of the Federation of German Consumer Organisations and environment minister from the Greens party in northern Germany's Schleswig-Holstein region, took over the network agency in March 2022, just days after Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24. 

            Natural gas prices had already risen on fears of lost supply, although Western sanctions against Moscow initially spared oil and natural gas. There were concerns about Europe's dependency on Russian gas used to heat homes, generate electricity and fire up industrial processes like making glass and fertilizer. 

            What followed was a scramble to find alternative pipeline supplies from friendly countries like Norway and to line up floating terminals that can import liquefied natural gas that comes by ship from suppliers including the U.S. and Qatar. 

            Russia had already limited supplies in the run-up to the invasion, leaving storage low. Then it started cutting back supplies, first to countries that wouldn't meet a demand to pay in Russian currency. On Aug. 31, it cut off the major Nord Stream 1 pipeline to Germany, citing technical problems. 

            There's still a bit of Russian gas — about 7% of supply — flowing to Europe through Ukraine to Slovakia and via Turkey to Bulgaria.

            The race to find new supplies was expensive — 10 billion euros went toward the floating terminals, and consumers are seeing painfully higher bills and inflation. But gas storage was full by December. Drawn down over the winter, storage facilities will have to be filled again over the summer. 

            One of Mueller’s first responsibilities as regulator was overseeing the establishment of a 24-hour crisis center next to his agency's skyscraper headquarters in Bonn, Germany’s capital until the 1999-2000 move to Berlin. 

            That’s where the agency would have decided which companies would get priority access to energy if supplies failed and the government declared a gas emergency. The center, equipped with diesel generators and stocks of food so it could operate even in a blackout, never had to be used. 

            Asked when he realized Germany had made it through the winter, Mueller said he was reassured by the full storage levels around Christmas. But complete relief is yet to come.

            “When it's really spring here will be the moment when we will have made it,"" he said. “We're still a couple of weeks away, and I'd rather stay cautious.”BONN, Germany (AP) — The temperature outside Klaus Mueller's office almost resembles spring, exactly the kind of mild weather that helped Germany get through the winter without Russian natural gas.But Germany's chief utility regulator is not ready to sound the all clear on an energy crisis spawned by the war in Ukraine, even with natural gas reserves abundant and prices well down from their peak.Too much could go wrong — especially if consumers and companies grow weary of the conservation habits they learned during a winter fraught with fear of rolling blackouts and rationing, Mueller, head of the Federal Network Agency, said in an interview Wednesday with The Associated Press.Plus, there's next winter to think about.Other risks, such as a pipeline accident or a sudden cold snap, could set back plans to keep natural gas storage as full as possible as Europe learns to live without the cheap Russian gas that fueled its economy for decades.Mueller would only concede that he's “optimistic” this winter will end without a further gas crunch, especially after Germany cut gas use by 14% in 2022 through lowering thermostats, switching to other fuels or halting energy-intensive industrial production.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819541,UK ruling delivers rare victory for Beirut blast victims,"BEIRUT (AP) — A British court has ruled a London-based company that delivered the explosive ammonium nitrate to Beirut's port is liable towards the victims of a devastating blast in 2020, Lebanon's Beirut Bar Association said Thursday.

            On Aug. 4 that year, hundreds of tons of the chemical, typically used in fertilizers, detonated, killing more than 200 people, injuring over 6,000 and damaging large parts of Beirut. Families of the explosion's victims saw the development as a rare step towards justice and against the political intervention that has obstructed the investigative judge leading a probe in Lebanon for over two years. 

            The ruling in London is an unusual judicial success for the victims' families, members of whom have advocated for an unimpeded national investigation. Some have opted to file lawsuits abroad.











            The London-registered chemical trading firm, Savaro Ltd., is suspected of having chartered the shipment of the ammonium nitrate in 2013 that ended up in Beirut. Documents show a handful of senior political, judicial and security officials were aware of the substance in the port for years, but did not take decisive action to get rid of it. 

            The Beirut Bar Association, alongside three victims' families, filed a lawsuit against Savaro Ltd. over a year ago. The judgment by the High Court of Justice in London means that the proceedings now move to a “damages phase"" of the case that determines the firm's compensation for the families, Camille Abousleiman, one of the lawyers involved in the case, told The Associated Press.

            “It’s the first time there is an actual judgment on this matter in reputable courts,” Abousleiman, also a former Lebanese labor minister, said. The ruling ""certainly will open the door for potential justice in courts overseas.”

            Mariana Foudoulian, whose sister Gaia died in the explosion, called the judgment a “very important step.""

            “Through this judgment, we can try to access more important details,” Foudoulian told the AP. “This does give us some hope.”

            The civil suit against Savaro Ltd. was filed in August 2021. Soon after, UK authorities blocked the firm's attempts to dissolve the company. It remains unclear who the owner of the company is. The listed owners are agents from a corporate services firm, investigative journalists from Lebanese and international outlets reported. The High Court of Justice in June 2022 ordered the company to reveal its true owners, though the firm never has done so. 

            Elsewhere, the Swiss foundation Accountability Now and some of the victims' families filed a lawsuit in Texas against U.S.-Norwegian geophysical services group TGS, which owns a company that allegedly sub-chartered the ship carrying the ammonium nitrate in 2012.

A magnitude 6.4 earthquake that struck the already battered province of Hatay this week damaged or demolished more buildings, compounding the devastation.

            Here’s a look at the key developments Thursday from the aftermath of the earthquake.

            DEATH TOLL TOPS 47,000











            Turkish Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu has raised the number of fatalities in Turkey from the magnitude 7.8 earthquake to 43,556. 

            The combined death toll in Turkey and Syria now stands at 47,244. 

            In an interview with state broadcaster TRT late on Wednesday, Soylu said teams were sifting through two buildings in hard-hit Hatay province in search of further bodies. Search operations elsewhere have come to an end, he said.

            Meanwhile, at least 164,000 buildings have either collapsed or are so damaged that they need to be demolished, said Murat Kurum, Turkey’s minister for the environment and urbanization. 

            SYRIANS SHELTER IN TENTS AND CARS

            The local civil defense in northwestern Syria, known locally as The White Helmets, said Thursday that thousands of children and tens of thousands of families have taken shelter in cars and tents “fearing they would face a repeat of the earthquake.”

            In government-held Syria, a first plane from Bahrain loaded with aid landed in Damascus. The Gulf monarchy is among many Arab countries that in recent years have tried to thaw relations with President Bashar Assad, after shunning him in 2011 for his brutal crackdown on protesters.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819555,Iconic West African leader Sankara reburied in Burkina Faso,"OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) — The late Burkina Faso revolutionary leader Thomas Sankara was reburied Thursday, eight years after his body was exhumed as part of an investigation. 

            Sankara's body, and those of the 12 people who died with him, were reburied at the site of his assassination, which has since become a memorial for Sankara featuring a life-sized statue of the former leader pumping his fist in the air. 

            Soldiers and community leaders paid tribute during a ceremony Thursday, some posing for pictures by Sankara’s coffin. All the coffins were draped in Burkina Faso flags with a photo beside them. 











            Sankara and the others were gunned down in the capital, Ouagadougou, during a 1987 coup and buried hastily. Their bodies were allowed to be dug up in 2015, after the ousting of former President Blaise Compaore. 

            Sankara, a charismatic Marxist leader with a reputation as ""Africa’s Che Guevara,"" came to power in 1983 at the age of 33 after he and Compaore led a leftist coup that overthrew a moderate military faction. But in 1987, Compaore turned on his former friend in a coup in which he seized power and then ruled the country for 30 years. 

            Last year, Compaore, who now lives in Ivory Coast, was tried in absentia and convicted of complicity in their murders. A Burkina Faso military tribunal sentenced him to life imprisonment. Compaore’s right-hand man, Gilbert Diendere, and former spy chief Tousma Yacinthe Kafando were also given life sentences. 

            Eight other people were found guilty of a range of charges including giving false testimonies and complicity in undermining state security.

            While Sankara's family was happy that he was finally laid to rest, they said the place of burial was like a slap in the face because of the horrors that occurred there. The family asked the government to bury him elsewhere but was told it was at the army’s discretion since Sankara was a soldier.

            “That place is painful for us to put our feet there. A lot of people were tortured there and crimes committed there and murders,” his younger brother Paul Sankara told The Associated Press by phone from the United States, where he lives. 

            The West African nation has struggled ith a jihadi insurgency linked to al-Qaida and the Islamic State group that has killed thousands and displaced nearly 2 million people and sowed division among the population, leading to two coups last year. 

            The current junta leader, Capt. Ibrahim Traore, has been likened by some to Sankara, as an anti-imperialist pan-African leader, and is using the reburial to increase support, analysts said.

            “With undertaking a symbolic state funeral for Sankara, Traore aims to boost his image by appealing to the collective memory of the young revolutionary leader that still shapes society in Burkina Faso,” said Mucahid Durmaz, senior analyst at Verisk Maplecroft, a global risk intelligence firm.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819556,"Almada, Chicharito among MLS players to watch this season","The biggest winner in the Major League Soccer offseason transfer market ended up being the rumor mill.

            Whether it was the apparent flirtation between Lionel Messi and Inter Miami, or the interest that Los Angeles FC had for Chelsea striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, neither came to fruition and the MLS offseason was devoid of a splashy incoming international move.

            But there are still plenty of stars across the MLS to watch for during the 2023 season that begins Saturday: 











            JESUS FERREIRA, FC DALLAS

            Ferreira finally reached his potential last season as he scored 18 goals for FC Dallas, tying for fourth-most in the league. He helped the team finish third in the Western Conference and reach the Western Conference semifinals before they were knocked out of the playoffs by Austin. His time with the MLS club meant he played only a limited role for the United States in the World Cup. He didn't hit the field in Qatar until the round of 16 loss to the Netherlands. He begins building his case this season to become one of the primary strikers on future U.S. teams. 

            HANY MUKHTAR, NASHVILLE

            The reigning league MVP was spectacular last season with 23 goals and 11 assists, helping Nashville finish fifth in the Western Conference and earn a playoff berth. Mukhtar’s 34 goals were the fifth-most in a single season in MLS history. 

            In his three seasons with Nashville, Mukhtar has 43 goals in 73 games and there’s no reason to think he’s about to slow down this season. 

            ANDRE BLAKE, PHILDELPHIA

            The best goalkeeper in the league last year is the most recognizable star for a team that lacks big names but is a clear favorite in the Eastern Conference. Philadelphia was moments away from winning its first MLS title in November before LAFC scored late in extra time and won on penalties. Philadelphia was in the final in large part because of Blake’s continued excellence in goal. Blake led MLS in shutouts with 15 and had a 79.4% save percentage last season, the third time he was honored as the league’s best goalie.

            CUCHO HERNANDEZ, COLUMBUS

            The latest young South American star to join MLS made quite the splash in his limited debut last season. Hernandez had nine goals and two assists in just 16 games for the Columbus Crew following his move from Watford.

            A full season with the Crew should be a big boost as Columbus looks to get back to the postseason after missing the playoffs by two points last season. 

            JAVIER “CHICHARITO” HERNANDEZ, LA GALAXY

            The ageless Mexican star stepped back into the past and led the LA Galaxy to a playoff berth last season. Chicharito had 18 goals and played in 32 matches, both highs since he moved to MLS. They were the most goals for Hernandez in any season since 2009-10, when he scored 21 in his final season with Chivas de Guadalajara. 

            JOSEF MARTINEZ, INTER MIAMI

            While rumors swirled about Lionel Messi and bringing the World Cup champion to Inter Miami, the club had a backup plan in place. How successful that plan is depends on whether Martinez can rediscover the form that made him the league’s MVP in 2018 with Atlanta United. 

            Martinez hasn’t been the same since suffering a major knee injury at the start of the 2020 season. And while posting consecutive seasons of 31 and 27 goals is going to be tough to match, Miami is hoping he can be more than the nine-goal scorer he was last season with Atlanta. 

            THIAGO ALMADA, ATLANTA UNITED

            The 21-year-old will step into a larger role this season for Atlanta United following the departure of Martinez to Miami. Almada appeared in 29 games and had six goals and seven assists last season. Atlanta will be hoping that Almada can quickly develop a relationship with new forward Giorgos Giakoumakis, who just arrived from Celtic. 

            SEAN JOHNSON, TORONTO

            After six years as the anchor at the back for NYCFC, including an MLS Cup title, Johnson made the move to Toronto FC in the offseason. Johnson was second in MLS with 14 clean sheets last season. 

            His task in Toronto will be significant as the Reds were third-worst in MLS by giving up 66 goals last season. 

            JOAO PAULO, SEATTLE

            The Seattle Sounders missed the MLS playoffs for the first time in franchise history last season, ending a 13-year run of playing in the postseason. Seattle’s season seemed to crumble after the Sounders won the CONCACAF Champions League, a night when they made MLS history but lost midfield sparkplug Joao Paulo to a torn ACL in his right knee. 

            Paulo is back, making a brief appearance for Seattle during its one match at the Club World Cup. His return should stabilize Seattle’s midfield and once again make the Sounders one of the favorites out West.

            More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsThe biggest winner in the Major League Soccer offseason transfer market ended up being the rumor mill.Whether it was the apparent flirtation between Lionel Messi and Inter Miami, or the interest that Los Angeles FC had for Chelsea striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, neither came to fruition and the MLS offseason was devoid of a splashy incoming international move.But there are still plenty of stars across the MLS to watch for during the 2023 season that begins Saturday:JESUS FERREIRA, FC DALLASFerreira finally reached his potential last season as he scored 18 goals for FC Dallas, tying for fourth-most in the league. He helped the team finish third in the Western Conference and reach the Western Conference semifinals before they were knocked out of the playoffs by Austin. His time with the MLS club meant he played only a limited role for the United States in the World Cup. He didn't hit the field in Qatar until the round of 16 loss to the Netherlands. He begins building his case this season to become one of the primary strikers on future U.S. teams.HANY MUKHTAR, NASHVILLEThe reigning league MVP was spectacular last season with 23 goals and 11 assists, helping Nashville finish fifth in the Western Conference and earn a playoff berth. Mukhtar’s 34 goals were the fifth-most in a single season in MLS history.In his three seasons with Nashville, Mukhtar has 43 goals in 73 games and there’s no reason to think he’s about to slow down this season.ANDRE BLAKE, PHILDELPHIAThe best goalkeeper in the league last year is the most recognizable star for a team that lacks big names but is a clear favorite in the Eastern Conference. Philadelphia was moments away from winning its first MLS title in November before LAFC scored late in extra time and won on penalties. Philadelphia was in the final in large part because of Blake’s continued excellence in goal. Blake led MLS in shutouts with 15 and had a 79.4% save percentage last season, the third time he was honored as the league’s best goalie.CUCHO HERNANDEZ, COLUMBUSThe latest young South American star to join MLS made quite the splash in his limited debut last season. Hernandez had nine goals and two assists in just 16 games for the Columbus Crew following his move from Watford.A full season with the Crew should be a big boost as Columbus looks to get back to the postseason after missing the playoffs by two points last season.JAVIER “CHICHARITO” HERNANDEZ, LA GALAXYThe ageless Mexican star stepped back into the past and led the LA Galaxy to a playoff berth last season. Chicharito had 18 goals and played in 32 matches, both highs since he moved to MLS. They were the most goals for Hernandez in any season since 2009-10, when he scored 21 in his final season with Chivas de Guadalajara.JOSEF MARTINEZ, INTER MIAMIWhile rumors swirled about Lionel Messi and bringing the World Cup champion to Inter Miami, the club had a backup plan in place.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819557,"5-way lead to open LPGA Thailand, Ko 3 shots back","PATTAYA, Thailand (AP) — Jennifer Kupcho of the United States fired a bogey-free 7-under 65 to share the lead alongside four other golfers after the opening round of the LPGA Thailand on Thursday.

            The crowded leaderboard was no surprise on the Pattaya Old Course: The average winning score over the past 10 years is 21 under par.

            Kupcho's round was highlighted by a birdie-birdie finish and an eagle on the par-5 10th hole at Siam Country Club.











            Of her eagle, she said, “I hit a really good drive and had a pretty short club in. Still hybrid but pretty perfect club, and it hit just short of the green and rolled up really close to a tap-in.”

            With her in the lead were 2014 champion Anna Nordquist of Sweden, six-time USLPGA Tour winner Nasa Hataoko of Japan, local hope and tour rookie Jaravee Boonchant, and last year's runner-up, Lin Xiyu of China.

            Three-time major winner Nordquist birdied her first hole, the 10th, and had eight in all against a lone bogey on the fourth.

            Hataoka bogeyed the 13th but finished her round with four consecutive birdies.

            Boonchant, who earned her tour card through Q-School last December, also started on the 10th and birdied her first two holes. She sparked Thai fans' hopes for a local victor after former world No, 1 Ariya Jutanugarn won in 2021.

            “Amazing,"" Boonchant said of her day.

            Lin started on the back nine and birdied six holes coming in for her 65. Last year, she opened with a 64 and reeled off 66s before losing to Nanna Koerstz Madsen of Denmark on extra holes. Koerstz Madsen has begun her title defense at 1 over.

            World No. 1 Lydia Ko of New Zealand, leading 26 of the top 30 at the event, had an error-free round of 68. She has won three of her last four starts.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819568,China faces economic collapse before 2030: Peter Zeihan,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Geopolitical analyst and consultant Peter Zeihan discussed the economic, demographic, and political landscape in East Asia with Taiwan News in early February.Zeihan, who recently published his fourth book, ""The End of the World is Just the Beginning: Mapping the Collapse of Globalization,"" spoke at length about demographic trends that could radically alter societies across the globe in the coming decade.In part one of the interview, Zeihan spoke at length about the demographic crisis that is affecting China. Based on his analysis, China is on the brink of economic collapse because it does not have sufficient population growth to maintain its own economic livelihood.As Zeihan explains, the severity of China’s demographic collapse is the result of Beijing’s one-child policy, which was enacted in 1980 and was in place until 2015. China most likely “passed it’s peak in population 15 years ago, and we are on track for the dissolution of China as an economic entity before the end of the decade,” said Zeihan.With such a large country, both in terms of population and economy, such a catastrophic collapse is unprecedented in human history. The nature and magnitude of this crisis could have unpredictable outcomes politically.However, China is not the only country dealing with serious demographic problems. Among other industrialized nations in Northeast Asia, Zeihan said that South Korea’s situation is the most serious and the most similar to China.Japan, although facing similar problems, has been one of the most proactive countries in the world to prepare for its own population decline. Therefore, Japan is better prepared to weather the economic and social transformation than most countries.As for Taiwan, Zeihan cautioned that it is on a “sharply negative track” in regard to population decline. However, Taiwan also has “a bit more elbow room than either Japan or Korea per capita.” Based on his estimates, Taiwan still has 20 to 30 years before the situation becomes as severe as South Korea.In that time, Taiwan would be wise to follow Japan in adopting measures and policies aimed at mitigating the worst effects of demographic decline.Watch part one of the Taiwan News interview with Peter Zeihan below. Keep an eye out for part two next week, which will focus on the possibility of military conflict between China and Taiwan.",2023/3/3,6618,Politics
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819569,International Mother Language Day  Taiwan’s CIP Presents Awards to 23 Individuals for Revitalizing Indigenous Languages,"TAIPEI, TAIWAN -  Media OutReach - 23 February 2023 - The Council of Indigenous Peoples held the 2023 International Mother Language Day – Indigenous Language Revitalization Awards Ceremony on February 16. Vice President Lai Ching-te and Premier Chen Chien-jen presented awards to the 23 recipients and offered their respect and gratitude for all those working to revitalize indigenous languages. Representatives of indigenous churches around Taiwan were also invited, for the first time, this year to discuss how government agencies can collaborate with indigenous churches in the future to achieve the UN's goal of encouraging sustainable mother language development.       Vice President Lai Ching-te and Minister Icyang Parod of the Council of Indigenous Peoples presenting the Lifetime Contribution Award.     Vice President Lai Ching-te shared in his remarks that Taiwan enacted the  Indigenous Languages Development Act in June 2017, establishing indigenous languages as one of the official languages of Taiwan. During his tenure as the premier, in January 2019, Taiwan promulgated the  Development of National Languages Act, wherein Hakka Chinese, Taiwanese Hokkien, the Matsu dialect, other natural languages used by existing communities, and the Taiwan Sign Language were all established as official languages of Taiwan.   Premier Chen Chien-jen expressed that the CIP has launched the highly important ""Program to Incentive Indigenous Churches to Encourage Indigenous Languages"" this year to support the  Development of National Languages Act. The program aims to encourage indigenous churches around the country to promote the use and learning of indigenous languages as indigenous churches are largely frequented by multiple generations, making it the perfect site for passing on indigenous languages. The Executive Yuan will continue to invest more resources and manpower and work with different sectors to foster a friendly environment for indigenous languages.   In subsequent meetings, Minister Icyang Parod also delivered his keynote speech on Sano' Amisen ita a somowal (let's speak our indigenous languages) to show the heads of indigenous agencies across the country how they can use indigenous languages in public settings, administrative meetings, on signs, and when promoting other public officials to foster an environment where the use of indigenous languages is common and prevalent.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819599,"Papua New Guinea kidnappers free woman, still hold 4 others","CANBERRA, Australia: (AP) — Kidnappers have released a woman who was held for several days in a remote area of Papua New Guinea, and security forces are continuing to negotiate for the freedom of four other hostages, police said Thursday.

            The woman, a Papua New Guinean citizen whose name has not been disclosed, was released to police on Wednesday, Deputy Police Commissioner Philip Mitna said in a statement.

            Police confirmed on Monday that a kidnapping had occurred in the poor South Pacific island nation but did not say when it began.











            A foreigner and three Papua New Guinea university students are still being held by several kidnappers near Fogoma’iu Village in the remote Highlands region, police said.

            The foreigner is a New Zealand citizen who lives in Australia and works as an archaeologist at an Australian university, according to media reports. The New Zealand and Australian governments have declined to comment.

            Police Commissioner David Manning said officers have been authorized to “use full force of the law to secure the people being held, and to immobilize and apprehend the criminals.”

            “We are offering the abductors a way out. They can release their captives and they will be treated fairly through the criminal justice system,” Manning said. “But failure to comply and resisting arrest could cost these criminals their lives.”

            The kidnappers have made a ransom demand, according to media reports. Kidnapping for ransom is an uncommon crime in Papua New Guinea, a tribal society of 9 million people who are mostly subsistence farmers.

            Papua New Guinean Prime Minister James Marape urged the kidnappers to release the remaining hostages.

            “You have nowhere to hide. All of you and your names and your faces are being profiled as we speak,” Marape told the Australian Broadcasting Corp, adding that more than 13 of the kidnappers have already been identified.

            The hostage who was released was a local person who was working with the kidnapped research team, ABC reported.CANBERRA, Australia: (AP) — Kidnappers have released a woman who was held for several days in a remote area of Papua New Guinea, and security forces are continuing to negotiate for the freedom of four other hostages, police said Thursday.The woman, a Papua New Guinean citizen whose name has not been disclosed, was released to police on Wednesday, Deputy Police Commissioner Philip Mitna said in a statement.Police confirmed on Monday that a kidnapping had occurred in the poor South Pacific island nation but did not say when it began.A foreigner and three Papua New Guinea university students are still being held by several kidnappers near Fogoma’iu Village in the remote Highlands region, police said.The foreigner is a New Zealand citizen who lives in Australia and works as an archaeologist at an Australian university, according to media reports.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819602,Eurojust to support probes into aggression in Ukraine war,"THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — The European Union's judicial cooperation agency, Eurojust, said Thursday that it is setting up a new center to support efforts to gather evidence of the crime of aggression in Ukraine.

            The announcement came on the eve of the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and amid international calls for accountability for war crimes in Ukraine and the prosecution of the crime of aggression by Russia’s leaders.

            Pressure is mounting for the establishment of a special tribunal to try Russia’s leaders for the crime of aggression — the illegal invasion of one country by another.











            “It is Ukraine’s firm belief that the accountability efforts should also include the prosecution of the leadership of the Russian Federation for the crime of aggression,"" Ukraine's representative to Eurojust, Myroslava Krasnoborova, said. ""The impunity for this supreme international crime should never be accepted.”

            The new International Center for Prosecution of the Crime of Aggression should be operational by summer, Eurojust said in a statement. The agency said the center will “support and enhance investigations into the crime of aggression by securing key evidence and facilitating case building at the earliest possible stage.” 

            It remains unclear when and where a prosecution for aggression could happen. The International Criminal Court, which is investigating in Ukraine, does not have jurisdiction. Krasnoborova said “all options are on the table” for a possible venue.

            Ukraine’s first lady, Olena Zelenska, on Wednesday called on the United Nations to set up an aggression tribunal.

            She is not alone. The European Union’s legislature passed a non-binding resolution in January calling on the 27-nation bloc to work “in close cooperation with Ukraine to seek and build political support in the U.N. General Assembly and other international forums ... for creating the special tribunal for the crime of aggression against Ukraine.”

            Amid the international efforts to ensure accountability, Ukrainian prosecutors are working on thousands of cases in their country.

            Krasnoborova said Ukrainian authorities already are investigating the crime of aggression and Ukrainian prosecutors have registered more than 71,000 alleged war crimes since the war began. She said 99 cases have been sent to courts and 26 verdicts have been reached.

            At a separate event in The Hague, Ukrainian human rights lawyer Oleksandra Matviichuk, who shared last year’s Nobel Peace Prize, said her organization has recorded more than 31,000 crimes and said all can be traced back to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

            “All these crimes became possible because of one leader’s decision — Putin and his surroundings — to initiate, to plan and to start the war of aggression. And this is a separate crime, which is called crime of aggression. And this crime has also to be punished,"" she said at a “people's tribunal” with no legal powers that has been set up by activists this week in The Hague. 

            Matviichuk also backed calls for an international tribunal to try the crime of aggression.

            “We ask for justice, not for revenge, because there will not be sustainable peace in our region without justice,” she said.

            Eurojust also said Thursday that it has formally opened a digital database for evidence of war crimes and other atrocities committed in Ukraine.

            “This database is a real game changer in the prosecution of international crimes,"" Eurojust President Ladislav Hamran said.

            Eurojust already is facilitating the work of a Joint Investigation Team made up of prosecutors from seven nations including Ukraine that also cooperates with the International Criminal Court prosecution office, which opened its own investigation in Ukraine almost a year ago.

            The investigation team's efforts in The Hague are part of a broader hunt across Europe for accountability for war crimes in Ukraine. Prosecutors in Poland, Germany, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, France, Slovakia, Sweden, Norway and Switzerland have opened investigations of their own.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819603,Italy in Ireland's crosshairs on path to Six Nations title,"The Ireland-France match lived up to the hype. Rugby's No. 1 vs. No. 2 showdown was a Six Nations classic.

            While the clash in Dublin two weeks ago was billed as a title decider, the title wasn't decided then.

            Victory gave the Irish, in terms of the tournament, only pole position in the race.











            To clinch a first title since 2018, the unbeaten tournament leader still has three matches and three weeks to go, resuming with Italy on Saturday in Rome.

            Backing up such a high isn't a problem for the Irish any longer. Neither is the absence of Jonathan Sexton quite the blow it used to be. A groin injury from the France game has sidelined Ireland's undisputed leader and driver of standards but he's gone to Rome anyway, along with the other surplus flyhalf Joey Carbery. It's not in Sexton's makeup to just be sampling pasta, though.

            “He still travels with us, he's still in the environment, he's still speaking in meetings, he's still pointing out things,” winger James Lowe says. ""Just because he's physically not playing or training doesn't mean he doesn't have an influence.

            “Even when Sexto is not there, there are a lot of boys who can pick up the slack.”

            Coach Owen Farrell chose lock James Ryan to captain Ireland a seventh time. His consistently strong performances have earned him the respect of the squad, says Farrell, who is just as impressed by Ryan's leadership off the field.

            That goes for others in camp, notably Caelan Doris, Hugo Keenan, Garry Ringrose, Robbie Henshaw and Tadhg Furlong.

            “We're very lucky,” Farrell says. “We're in a great place in that we would be more than happy for a handful of players to captain the side. You look at the development of somebody like Caelan, Hugo or Garry, there's a reason why they're playing so well. They tend to work unbelievably hard off the field and try and give as much as they possibly can to their teammates.”

            Whipped along by Sexton, whether he's playing or not, Ireland's self-belief has risen to a level of supreme confidence.

            “You could put any team in front of us at the moment,” Lowe says, “and I feel like it's up to us whether or not we perform.”

            The Irish are Leinster heavy, and after seven changes — one positional — they have even more starters from Leinster; 10. Ronan Kelleher, Iain Henderson, Jack Conan and Bundee Aki have come in, and flyhalf Ross Byrne and scrumhalf Craig Casey are starters in the Six Nations for the first time. Byrne and Casey made their test debuts against Italy in 2018 and 2021 respectively.

            They are expected to grease an Ireland licking of Italy at Stadio Olimpico.

            “We're always trying to push standards here and never rest on what we've done,” Conan says. ""We want to be better against Italy. We were good against Wales for 30, 40 minutes. It was a more complete performance against France but there is such a scope to improve, which is incredibly exciting, because we're the No. 1 team in the world and we're looking around and aren't happy with what we've produced at times.

            ""I think any organization that is that self-critical and wanting more from themselves is an organization that is going to go places, so exciting times.”

            Italy has embraced flyhalf Paolo Garbisi, recovered from a knee ligament injury at New Year's. But they have to be worried. In a chastening defeat to England at Twickenham, the forward pack was overwhelmed in the scrum and maul, and three tries were conceded while two players were sin-binned.

            “Our goal is to improve the performance from the previous game,” back Tommaso Menoncello says. “In particular, we have to concede fewer penalties.”

            ___

            Lineups:

            Italy: Ange Capuozzo, Edoardo Padovani, Juan Ignacio Brex, Tommaso Menoncello, Pierre Bruno, Paolo Garbisi, Stephen Varney; Lorenzo Cannone, Michele Lamaro (captain), Sebastian Negri, Federico Ruzza, Niccolo Cannone, Simone Ferrari, Giacomo Nicotera, Danilo Fischetti. Reserves: Luca Bigi, Federico Zani, Marco Riccioni, Edoardo Iachizzi, Giovanni Pettinelli, Alessandro Fusco, Luca Morisi, Tommaso Allan.

            Ireland: Hugo Keenan, Mack Hansen, Garry Ringrose, Bundee Aki, James Lowe, Ross Byrne, Craig Casey; Jack Conan, Josh van der Flier, Caelan Doris, James Ryan (captain), Iain Henderson, Finley Bealham, Ronan Kelleher, Andrew Porter.

            More AP rugby: https://apnews.com/hub/rugby and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsThe Ireland-France match lived up to the hype. Rugby's No. 1 vs. No. 2 showdown was a Six Nations classic.While the clash in Dublin two weeks ago was billed as a title decider, the title wasn't decided then.Victory gave the Irish, in terms of the tournament, only pole position in the race.To clinch a first title since 2018, the unbeaten tournament leader still has three matches and three weeks to go, resuming with Italy on Saturday in Rome.Backing up such a high isn't a problem for the Irish any longer. Neither is the absence of Jonathan Sexton quite the blow it used to be. A groin injury from the France game has sidelined Ireland's undisputed leader and driver of standards but he's gone to Rome anyway, along with the other surplus flyhalf Joey Carbery. It's not in Sexton's makeup to just be sampling pasta, though.“He still travels with us, he's still in the environment, he's still speaking in meetings, he's still pointing out things,” winger James Lowe says. ""Just because he's physically not playing or training doesn't mean he doesn't have an influence.“Even when Sexto is not there, there are a lot of boys who can pick up the slack.”Coach Owen Farrell chose lock James Ryan to captain Ireland a seventh time. His consistently strong performances have earned him the respect of the squad, says Farrell, who is just as impressed by Ryan's leadership off the field.That goes for others in camp, notably Caelan Doris, Hugo Keenan, Garry Ringrose, Robbie Henshaw and Tadhg Furlong.“We're very lucky,” Farrell says. “We're in a great place in that we would be more than happy for a handful of players to captain the side. You look at the development of somebody like Caelan, Hugo or Garry, there's a reason why they're playing so well. They tend to work unbelievably hard off the field and try and give as much as they possibly can to their teammates.”Whipped along by Sexton, whether he's playing or not, Ireland's self-belief has risen to a level of supreme confidence.“You could put any team in front of us at the moment,” Lowe says, “and I feel like it's up to us whether or not we perform.”The Irish are Leinster heavy, and after seven changes — one positional — they have even more starters from Leinster; 10. Ronan Kelleher, Iain Henderson, Jack Conan and Bundee Aki have come in, and flyhalf Ross Byrne and scrumhalf Craig Casey are starters in the Six Nations for the first time. Byrne and Casey made their test debuts against Italy in 2018 and 2021 respectively.They are expected to grease an Ireland licking of Italy at Stadio Olimpico.“We're always trying to push standards here and never rest on what we've done,” Conan says. ""We want to be better against Italy. We were good against Wales for 30, 40 minutes. It was a more complete performance against France but there is such a scope to improve, which is incredibly exciting, because we're the No. 1 team in the world and we're looking around and aren't happy with what we've produced at times.""I think any organization that is that self-critical and wanting more from themselves is an organization that is going to go places, so exciting times.”Italy has embraced flyhalf Paolo Garbisi, recovered from a knee ligament injury at New Year's. But they have to be worried. In a chastening defeat to England at Twickenham, the forward pack was overwhelmed in the scrum and maul, and three tries were conceded while two players were sin-binned.“Our goal is to improve the performance from the previous game,” back Tommaso Menoncello says. “In particular, we have to concede fewer penalties.”___Lineups:Italy: Ange Capuozzo, Edoardo Padovani, Juan Ignacio Brex, Tommaso Menoncello, Pierre Bruno, Paolo Garbisi, Stephen Varney; Lorenzo Cannone, Michele Lamaro (captain), Sebastian Negri, Federico Ruzza, Niccolo Cannone, Simone Ferrari, Giacomo Nicotera, Danilo Fischetti.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819604,EU dampens Bulgaria's hopes of joining eurozone before 2025,"SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) — A senior European Union official on Thursday dampened Bulgaria’s aspirations for a swift adoption of the euro currency as the Balkan country doesn't meet all required entry criteria.

            European Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis told reporters before his meetings with Bulgarian officials that the country wouldn't become a eurozone member before the beginning of 2025.

            Bulgaria, which is the EU’s poorest member, hopes that the euro will boost the country's economy and financial security, but a prolonged political crisis has changed the agenda.











            Before a new election in April — the fifth in two years — the main political parties declared as a main priority to bring the country into the 20-member eurozone on Jan. 1, 2024.

            Dombrovskis, however, set a different timeline. He stressed that the main stumbling block for Bulgaria is inflation, which is especially high since Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year.

            While Bulgaria complies in terms of public finances, long-term interest rates and stable exchange rates, it fails to comply with the inflation criterion by a significant margin, which makes it impossible to enter the eurozone at the beginning of 2024.

            Bulgaria’s harmonized inflation climbed to 14.3% year-on-year at the end of 2022.

            “Let’s hope that the delay will not be long, and that accession will be possible a year later,” he told Bulgarian National Television.

            Dombrovskis also said that Bulgaria needs to make more efforts to combat corruption by adopting reforms to money laundering legislation.SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) — A senior European Union official on Thursday dampened Bulgaria’s aspirations for a swift adoption of the euro currency as the Balkan country doesn't meet all required entry criteria.European Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis told reporters before his meetings with Bulgarian officials that the country wouldn't become a eurozone member before the beginning of 2025.Bulgaria, which is the EU’s poorest member, hopes that the euro will boost the country's economy and financial security, but a prolonged political crisis has changed the agenda.Before a new election in April — the fifth in two years — the main political parties declared as a main priority to bring the country into the 20-member eurozone on Jan. 1, 2024.Dombrovskis, however, set a different timeline.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819613,Israel: Oman to allow Israeli planes through its airspace,"TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israel's foreign minister said Thursday that the Gulf Arab state of Oman has decided to allow Israeli planes to fly through its airspace. The announcement was another sign of closer ties between Israel and some Arab countries.

            Oman's Civil Aviation Authority tweeted that it “affirms that the Sultanate’s airspace is open for all carriers that meet the requirements of the Authority for overflying,” without directly mentioning Israel.

            The move comes on the heels last year of a similar step by Saudi Arabia, and would shorten the flying distance between Israel and Asia. 











            “This is a significant and historic decision for the Israeli economy and Israeli travelers,” said Foreign Minister Eli Cohen, who said there had been American involvement in the decision.

            In Washington, Adrienne Watson, the National Security spokesperson, welcomed Oman's decision, calling it a ‘’historic step'"" that completes a process begun last year, during President Joe Biden’s visit to the region “when Saudi Arabia similarly opened its airspace to all civilian planes.”

            “The United States was pleased to support these efforts through months of quiet diplomatic engagement,” she said.

            Oman and Israel have had secretive ties for years, which were spotlighted in 2018 when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made a surprise visit to the country, the first trip of its kind in over 20 years. 

            Still, Oman was not among the four countries to sign normalization deals with Israel in 2020 under U.S-brokered agreements known as the Abraham Accords. The United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, as well as Morocco and Sudan, all agreed to normalize ties with Israel as part of the deals.

            The sultanate has long had a low-key role in fostering negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians. Oman, which sits on the southeastern tip of the Arabian Peninsula, with Saudi Arabia to its north and Iran to its east, also has a long record of being a quiet broker in the region, opting to stay on the sidelines of the rivalry between the two regional powerhouses.

            Oman has also served as a mediator between the United States and Israel’s arch-rival Iran. Oman hosted the secret talks that eventually led to the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement and has facilitated the release of prisoners and hostages held by armed groups. 

            Earlier this week, Oman welcomed Syrian President Bashar Assad on his first visit outside Syria since the earthquake there earlier this month.TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israel's foreign minister said Thursday that the Gulf Arab state of Oman has decided to allow Israeli planes to fly through its airspace.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819614,Turkey cuts bank rate even as it grapples with earthquake,"ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Turkey’s central bank on Thursday resumed its policy of lowering a key interest rate even as the country grapples with high inflation and the aftermath of a devastating earthquake. 

            The bank’s Monetary Policy Committee said it cut the benchmark policy rate by 0.5 of a percentage point, down to 8.5%. The Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey, slashed the benchmark rate by 5 percentage points - down to 9% - between August and November but had left rates unchanged since then. 

            The cuts have come despite the country's high inflation, which currently stands at 57.68% and has caused a cost-of-living crisis. Central banks around the world have raised rates to fight inflation in their countries.











            The magnitude 7.8 earthquake that struck parts of Turkey and Syria on Feb. 6 killed more than 43,500 people in Turkey and destroyed 164,000 buildings. It has been described at the worst disaster the country’s modern history.

            The central bank said the quake would not impact Turkey’s economy in the medium term.

            “The impact of the earthquake on production, consumption, employment and expectations is being extensively evaluated,” the bank said in a statement. “While the earthquake is expected to affect economic activity in the near term, it is anticipated that it will not have a permanent impact on performance of the Turkish economy in the medium term”

            The rate cuts are in line with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s unorthodox economic views that high borrowing costs cause high inflation, even though traditional economic thinking says raising interest rates help tame inflation.

            Earlier this month, Erdogan criticized rate increases by central banks around the world, signaling his intention to lower interest rates further.ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Turkey’s central bank on Thursday resumed its policy of lowering a key interest rate even as the country grapples with high inflation and the aftermath of a devastating earthquake.The bank’s Monetary Policy Committee said it cut the benchmark policy rate by 0.5 of a percentage point, down to 8.5%.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819630,Vinícius to face Atletico again after effigy hate attack,"BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — Real Madrid forward Vinícius Júnior has endured some of the vilest racist attacks in recent memory this season.

            That has not stopped him from emerging as one of the top players both in Spain and in the Champions League, where this week he scored twice to spark Madrid’s 5-2 comeback win at Liverpool.

            On Saturday, the 22-year-old Brazil winger will again be expected to play a leading role in the league match against crosstown rival Atletico Madrid at the Santiago Bernabéu.











            The derby comes one month after Vinícius, who is Black, was targeted by a hate attack hours before he scored to help Madrid fight back to eliminate Atletico 3-1 in the Copa del Rey quarterfinals. Before that game, an effigy of Vinícius was hung from a highway bridge in Spain’s capital along with a banner with the words “Madrid hates Real.”

            The incident drew condemnation by both clubs and soccer officials across the nation but authorities have yet to find out who was responsible.

            This weekend’s game will again be played in Madrid’s stadium, possibly shielding Vinícius from chants he has heard at recent away games. The Spanish league has filed eight complaints with authorities for racist insults or chants against Vinícius, with three of them being shelved by prosecutors and another three being accepted for processing before courts.

            Last week, he had to endure shouts of “Die, Vinícius” during a 2-0 victory at Osasuna in Pamplona.

            “The insults continue, but so does the dancing,” Vinícius wrote on Twitter after the victory in reference to his goal celebrations that some opposing fans and even players have said are disrespectful.

            Vinícius has responded by noting that some white players also dance after scoring without receiving the same reaction.

            Vinícius has only continued to improve this season, evolving from Karim Benzema’s sidekick to a budding superstar in his own right. The pair of scorers have each netted 18 goals overall this season. Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti called Vinícius “the most decisive player in world football” after his team's big win at Anfield on Tuesday.

            Madrid has dominated the rivalry with Atletico in recent years, losing only once in their last 11 meetings. Atletico’s sole win in that stretch came at home in the league last season. Atletico hasn’t won at Madrid since 2016.

            Madrid has beaten Atletico twice already this season, but anything other than another victory would put in jeopardy Madrid's title defense.

            Barcelona is already eight points clear and visits Almeria on Sunday in what should be a relatively easy outing even without the injured Pedri González and Ousmane Dembélé.

            Atletico is in fourth place, 18 points out of the title race and already eliminated from European competition and the Copa del Rey. Diego Simeone’s sole objective is holding onto a Champions League spot.

            Real Sociedad is in third place, only two points ahead of Atletico. Real Betis is four points behind in fifth.

            Atletico will likely be without Argentina midfielder Rodrigo de Paul, who has injured his left thigh.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819631,Ukraine: Drone footage shows scale of Bakhmut's destruction,"BAKHMUT, Ukraine (AP) — Amid the smoking ruins, a lone dog pads in the snow, surely unaware — or perhaps too hungry to care — that death rains down regularly from the skies on the remnants of this Ukrainian city that Russia is pounding into rubble.

            But for now Bakhmut stands — growing as a symbol of Ukrainian resistance with each additional day that its defenders hold out against Russia's relentless shelling and waves of Russian troops taking heavy casualties in a months-long but so far futile campaign to capture it.

            New video footage of Bakhmut shot from the air with a drone for The Associated Press shows how the longest battle of the year-long Russian invasion has turned the city of salt and gypsum mines in eastern Ukraine into a ghost town, its jagged destruction testament to the folly of war.











            The footage — shot Feb. 13 — shows no people. But they are still there -- somewhere, out of sight, in basements and defensive strongholds, trying to survive. Of the prewar population of 80,000, a few thousand residents have refused or been unable to evacuate. The size of the garrison that Ukraine has stationed in the city is kept secret.

            Tire tracks on the roads and footprints on the paths covered with snow speak to a continued human presence. In one shot, a car drives swiftly away in the distance. Graffiti spray-painted on the charred, pockmarked outer walls of a blown-out storefront also show people are or were here.

            “Bakhmut loves Ukraine,” it reads. Next to that is the stenciled face of Valerii Zaluzhnyi, the commander-in-chief of Ukraine’s armed forces, holding up two fingers in a V-for-victory gesture. ""God and Valerii Zaluzhnyi are with us,” reads writing underneath.

            A top Ukrainian intelligence official this week likened the fight for Bakhmut to Ukraine's dogged defense of Mariupol earlier in the war, which tied up Russian forces for months, preventing the Kremlin from deploying them elsewhere. 

            Likewise, ""Bakhmut is also an indicator and a fortress,"" the official, Vadym Skibitskyi, said in an AP interview. He said the city has come to represent “the indomitability of our soldiers” and that by holding it, Ukraine is inflicting “unacceptable” casualties on the Russians.

            From the air, the scale of destruction becomes plain to see. Entire rows of apartment buildings have been gutted, just the outer walls left standing and the roofs and interior floors gone, exposing the ruins’ innards to the snow and winter frost — and the drone’s prying eye.

            Like a caver descending into a chasm, the drone drops slowly into one of the blown-out hulks — all four of its floors now collapsed into a pile of ashes, rubble and rusting metal at the bottom.

            Another five-story apartment building has a giant bite torn out of it. A black crow flies through the gap. The drone peers into a kitchen, a once-intimate family place now exposed because one of its outer walls has been torn away. There is still a strainer in the sink and plates on the drying rack above, as though someone still lives there. But the undisturbed dusting of snow on the cloth-covered table suggests they are long gone.

            As the drone continues its journey, along streets where crowds no longer walk and past stores where they no longer shop, over parks where children no longer play and where old-timers no longer chew the fat, the names of towns and cities flattened in previous wars spring to mind.

            Fleury-devant-Douaumont, France — a village razed in World War I, changing hands 16 times in fighting between French and German troops from June to August 1916. Never rebuilt, it was later declared to have “Died for France” — along with eight other villages destroyed in the fearsome battle for the French town of Verdun.

            Or Oradour-sur-Glane, also in France, destroyed in World War II. Its ruins have been left untouched as a memorial to 642 people killed there on June 10, 1944. Nazi troops from the fanatical SS “Das Reich” division herded civilians into barns and a church and torched the village — the biggest civilian massacre by France's wartime occupiers.

            For Ukrainians, Bakhmut also is becoming etched indelibly in the collective consciousness. Its defense is already hailed in song. The track “Bakhmut Fortress,"" by Ukrainian band Antytila, has racked up more than 3.8 million views. 

            “Mom, I'm standing,” they sing. “Motherland, I'm fighting.”

            In other developments Thursday:

            — The Moldovan government appealed for calm and urged the public to follow only “official and credible” sources of news after Russia alleged Ukraine is planning an “armed provocation” in Moldova’s Moscow-backed breakaway region of Transnistria. Russia maintains about 1,500 “peacekeeping” troops in the region, which is internationally recognized as part of Moldova.

            Shortly before the Russian Defense Ministry’s claim, an adviser to Ukraine’s Ministry of Internal Affairs, Anton Herashchenko, said Ukraine and NATO could together return Transnistria to Moldova within 24 hours.

            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has previously stated that Ukraine is ready to provide all necessary assistance to Moldova.

            Moscow alleged, citing intelligence data without presenting any evidence, that Ukrainian soldiers disguised as Russian troops planned to launch a false flag attack to blame Russia for invading Ukraine from Transnistria that Kyiv would then use as a pretext for an invasion of the territory.

            Late Thursday, the Russian Defense Ministry issued another warning of what it described as an impending Ukrainian “provocation,” reporting a massive Ukrainian military buildup near Transnistria including artillery in positions ready for combat.

            “The Russian armed forces will adequately respond to the provocation planned by the Ukrainian side,” the ministry said.

            — Russian President Vladimir Putin gave another signal he is digging in for a protracted war, saying his government will prioritize strengthening Russia’s defense capabilities. Speaking on Defender of the Fatherland Day, a public holiday, he announced the deployment of the Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile system and the delivery of a massive supply of Zircon sea-launched hypersonic missiles to Russian forces. He added that three Borei-class nuclear submarines would be added to the fleet in the coming years.

            — The U.N. General Assembly approved a nonbinding resolution Thursday urging Russia to end hostilities in Ukraine and to withdraw its forces.

            — At least three civilians were killed and eight others were wounded in Ukraine over the past 24 hours, the presidential office reported. Russian forces over the past day launched more than 80 artillery barrages of six towns and villages in northeastern Ukraine’s Sumy region, which borders Russia, local Ukrainian authorities reported. Ukrainian forces also repelled about 90 Russian attacks in the country’s east, where fierce fighting has raged for months, the Ukrainian military said.

But they are still there -- somewhere, out of sight, in basements and defensive strongholds, trying to survive. Of the prewar population of 80,000, a few thousand residents have refused or been unable to evacuate. The size of the garrison that Ukraine has stationed in the city is kept secret.Tire tracks on the roads and footprints on the paths covered with snow speak to a continued human presence. In one shot, a car drives swiftly away in the distance. Graffiti spray-painted on the charred, pockmarked outer walls of a blown-out storefront also show people are or were here.“Bakhmut loves Ukraine,” it reads. Next to that is the stenciled face of Valerii Zaluzhnyi, the commander-in-chief of Ukraine’s armed forces, holding up two fingers in a V-for-victory gesture. ""God and Valerii Zaluzhnyi are with us,” reads writing underneath.A top Ukrainian intelligence official this week likened the fight for Bakhmut to Ukraine's dogged defense of Mariupol earlier in the war, which tied up Russian forces for months, preventing the Kremlin from deploying them elsewhere.Likewise, ""Bakhmut is also an indicator and a fortress,"" the official, Vadym Skibitskyi, said in an AP interview. He said the city has come to represent “the indomitability of our soldiers” and that by holding it, Ukraine is inflicting “unacceptable” casualties on the Russians.From the air, the scale of destruction becomes plain to see. Entire rows of apartment buildings have been gutted, just the outer walls left standing and the roofs and interior floors gone, exposing the ruins’ innards to the snow and winter frost — and the drone’s prying eye.Like a caver descending into a chasm, the drone drops slowly into one of the blown-out hulks — all four of its floors now collapsed into a pile of ashes, rubble and rusting metal at the bottom.Another five-story apartment building has a giant bite torn out of it. A black crow flies through the gap. The drone peers into a kitchen, a once-intimate family place now exposed because one of its outer walls has been torn away. There is still a strainer in the sink and plates on the drying rack above, as though someone still lives there. But the undisturbed dusting of snow on the cloth-covered table suggests they are long gone.As the drone continues its journey, along streets where crowds no longer walk and past stores where they no longer shop, over parks where children no longer play and where old-timers no longer chew the fat, the names of towns and cities flattened in previous wars spring to mind.Fleury-devant-Douaumont, France — a village razed in World War I, changing hands 16 times in fighting between French and German troops from June to August 1916.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819633,Bayern playing to keep Bundesliga top spot against Union,"DUESSELDORF, Germany (AP) — Forget the Champions League. For Bayern Munich at least, the Bundesliga is where the real drama is.

            One of Bayern's most assured performances of recent months, beating Paris Saint-Germain 1-0, was followed by one of its worst in a 3-2 loss to Borussia Mönchengladbach last week.

            Tempers flared following a contentious red card for defender Dayot Upamecano and Bayern coach Julian Nagelsmann ended up with a 50,000 euro ($53,100) fine for haranguing the refereeing team after the game. Only a prompt apology and Nagelsmann's previous good behavior saved the coach from a suspension.











            Now Bayern is gearing up to play Union Berlin on Sunday, needing a win to hold onto first place in the Bundesliga. Bayern may have won 10 league titles in a row, but now the Bundesliga has a three-way title race.

            Bayern is even on points with both Union and Borussia Dortmund, and ahead only on goal difference. Bayern went into Germany's extended winter break for the World Cup with a four-point lead but that evaporated with only two wins from six league games so far in 2023.

            Both Union and Dortmund are unbeaten since the new year. That's an especially impressive achievement for the Berlin team, given its small budget and the fact it has the busiest recent schedule of any German team because of commitments in the German Cup and the Europa League.

            Union could even be at the top of the Bundesliga this week. After Bayern's loss to Gladbach on Saturday, all Union had to do to take first place was to beat last-place Schalke. The team only managed a 0-0 draw.

            Bayern had a boost Thursday as fullback Noussair Mazraoui returned to training with the team for the first time this year. Mazraoui contracted COVID-19 while playing for Morocco at the World Cup, Bayern said, and has been on the sidelines after inflammation was found in the tissue around his heart.

            Chances are that Bayern will — temporarily at least — be displaced at the top before the Union game, since Dortmund is in action first Saturday against out-of-form Hoffenheim. Dortmund is on an eight-game winning run in all competitions, including last week's 1-0 win over Chelsea in the Champions League. Hoffenheim has only one point so far in 2023 as American coach Pellegrino Matarazzo searches for what would be the team's first win since October.

            Dortmund coach Edin Terzic praised the atmosphere around the club Thursday but warned against overconfidence.

            “We haven't reached our goal yet,” he said. “There will be setbacks ahead, too.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819634,Wales seeks first win in Six Nations after off-field chaos,"The time for talking — and there's been plenty of that these past few days — is about to stop.

            After Wales' players backed away from going on strike for the Six Nations match against England, one of the iconic fixtures in world rugby is going ahead as planned in Cardiff on Saturday.

            An off-field crisis has been averted, or maybe just delayed.











            There might be one facing Welsh rugby on the field should England go back over the Severn Bridge with a first victory at the Principality Stadium since 2017.

            If Wales was to lose, that would be three defeats on the spin for Warren Gatland at the start of his second spell in charge of the team. That hasn’t happened to Wales for 20 years, when another New Zealander — Steve Hansen — was at the helm. 

            There’s already been a 34-10 walloping by Ireland in Cardiff in Round 1 and a record 35-7 loss to Scotland at Murrayfield in Round 2. The English would love nothing more than to pile on the misery for the Welsh in their own backyard.

            For Gatland, there’s an acute sense that he doesn’t quite know where to turn, with his selections highlighting the concerns he has regarding the balance of his team.

            Veteran forwards Alun Wyn Jones, Taulupe Faletau and Justin Tipuric all started against Ireland, were dropped against Scotland, and are back to face England.

            Now it’s the time for a couple of long-serving backs to lose their spots, with center George North and flyhalf Dan Biggar — each of whom have more than 100 caps — out of the team for the England match. North didn’t even make the bench.

            In a Rugby World Cup year, Gatland seems keen to ensure his backups are getting enough test experience in case they are needed down the line. It’s the here and now that is more important, though, for Wales rugby fans who also saw the team endure a miserable autumn that included an embarrassing loss to Georgia.

            Indeed, these are tumultuous times for the national game. The buildup to the Six Nations was dominated by a scandal that saw the Welsh Rugby Union mired in allegations of sexism, bullying and racism made in a scathing TV documentary.

            Then came back-to-back heavy defeats, followed by a contractual row that broke out over the fallow week and no doubt hampered preparations for a must-win game against the English.

            Gatland might be wondering why he came back, especially given the team looks to be going through a period of transition.

            For the moment, he is just happy he has a game to prepare for.

            “I’m just happy things have got sorted and we can finally focus on Saturday,” Gatland said. “I told the players, ’This is an opportunity to draw a line in the sand and focus completely on preparing for Saturday.'”

            England coach Steve Borthwick said his team prepared all week for the game going ahead as scheduled and had “incredible sympathy” for the situation the Welsh players found themselves in. Some have been turning out for their country not knowing if they would be getting a new contract at the end of this season because of the failure of the WRU and its four regions to reach agreement on a new financial deal.

            “No professional athlete should have to deal with that level of uncertainty and anxiety,” Borthwick said.

            Borthwick has his own issues to deal with, though. England opened by getting sliced apart by Scotland, only to turn in a more solid display at Twickenham in a Round 2 win over Italy.

            England is unlikely to veer too far from the basics in Cardiff and welcomes back two experienced players in winger Anthony Watson — making his first international start in nearly two years — and lock Courtney Lawes, who's fit enough to make the bench after a string of injuries.

            The dropping of North opens the door for 20-year-old center Mason Grady to make his senior debut for Wales, after just 20 first-team appearances for Cardiff Blues. Grady, who is highly rated, has similar physical attributes to North but not the experience.

            It will be quite the baptism of fire on Saturday.

            “He is a big lad, he has got some really lovely rugby skills and offloading ability,” Gatland said of Grady. “He is quick, so he is the kind of center that I think is going to have it all going forward.""

            ___

            Wales: Leigh Halfpenny, Josh Adams, Mason Grady, Joe Hawkins, Louis Rees-Zammit, Owen Williams, Tomos Williams; Taulupe Faletau, Justin Tipuric, Christ Tshiunza, Alun Wyn Jones, Adam Beard, Tomas Francis, Ken Owens (captain), Gareth Thomas.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819635,Trump investigation: Could grand juror's words tank charges?,"ATLANTA (AP) — Almost as soon as the foreperson of the special grand jury in the Georgia election meddling investigation went public this week, speculation began about whether her unusually candid revelations could jeopardize any possible prosecution of former President Donald Trump or others.

            Emily Kohrs first spoke out in an interview published Tuesday by The Associated Press, a story that was followed by interviews in other print and television news outlets. In detailed commentary, she described some of what happened behind the closed doors of the jury room — how witnesses behaved, how prosecutors interacted with them, how some invoked their constitutional right not to answer certain questions.

            Lawyers for Trump say the revelations offered by Kohrs shattered the credibility of the entire special grand jury investigation. People hoping to see the former president indicted worried on social media that Kohrs may have tanked a case against the former president. But experts said that while Kohrs' chattiness in news interviews probably aggravated Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, who's leading the investigation, they were not legally damaging.











            Willis likely “wishes that this woman hadn’t gone on the worldwide tour that she did,"" said Amy Lee Copeland, a former federal prosecutor and criminal defense attorney in Georgia who’s not involved in the case. ""But is this a headache that is grinding the machine to a halt? It’s not. It’s just one of the many frustrations that attends the practice of law.” 

            Trump's attorneys in Georgia, however, are jumping on the interviews.

            Drew Findling and Jennifer Little, who represent Trump in the Fulton County case, said they've had concerns about the panel's proceedings from the start but have kept quiet out of respect for the grand jury process. After Kohrs' interviews, they felt compelled to speak out.

            “The end product is, the reliability of anything that has taken place in there is completely tainted and called into question,” Findling said. But he also said he wasn't attacking “a 30-year-old foreperson.”

            “She’s a product of a circus that cloaked itself as a special purpose grand jury,"" he said.

            Findling and Little hadn't filed any challenges in the case by Thursday but said they're “resolute"" as to Trump's innocence and keeping their options open. 

            “We're considering everything and anything to look after the interests of our client,” he said. 

            The special grand jury was impaneled at the request of Willis, who is investigating whether Trump and his Republican allies committed crimes as they tried to overturn his narrow 2020 election loss in the state to Democrat Joe Biden. The panel didn't have the power to indict but instead offered recommendations for Willis, a Democrat, who will ultimately decide whether to seek charges from a regular grand jury.

            Willis’ office has declined to comment on Kohrs’ media appearances, other than to say they weren’t aware ahead of time that she planned to give interviews. Spokesperson Jeff DiSantis also declined Thursday to comment on the statements from Trump's attorneys.

            The former president's lawyers expressed concern that the special grand jury had been allowed to watch and read news coverage of the case and was aware of some witnesses' efforts not to testify. Kohrs said prosecutors told the jurors they could read and watch the news but urged them to keep open minds.

            Kohrs also shared numerous anecdotes from the proceedings that she found amusing and was very expressive in television interviews, sometimes laughing or making faces.

            “It’s not a joking matter,” Findling said. “It’s not a matter for giggles. It’s not a matter for smiles.”

            Findling and Little said the district attorney's office, which advised the special grand jury, should have better educated the grand jurors about the solemnity of the process and the rules and limitations.

            “That tone and that rhetoric begins from the top down, and that was set by the district attorney’s office,"" Little said.

            Trump himself criticized the process in a post on his social media network Wednesday, calling the Georgia investigation “ridiculous, a strictly political continuation of the greatest Witch Hunt of all time.” He expressed dismay at Kohrs “going around and doing a Media Tour revealing, incredibly, the Grand Jury's inner workings & thoughts.”

            Though Kohrs did not publicly name anyone the special grand jury recommended for possible indictment, Trump's lawyers said she seemed to implicate him in response to questions. 

            They also said the judge overseeing the special grand jury could have instructed or strongly suggested that the grand jurors not speak publicly until the panel's full final report was made public. Several parts of the report were released last week, but Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney said any section that recommended specific charges for specific people would remain secret for now.

            During a hearing last month, a lawyer for a coalition of news outlets, including the AP, urged the immediate release of the full report.

            In the federal system, grand jurors are prohibited from talking about what witnesses say or anything that happens in the room. But the Georgia special grand jury oath says only that they cannot talk about their deliberations.

            The special grand jury was dissolved Jan. 9, and Judge McBurney told the AP that he later met with grand jurors to discuss where things stood. He said he provided them with the “rules of the road” of what they were legally allowed and not allowed to discuss publicly.

            He said they could discuss what witnesses said and what is in the report but could not talk about deliberations because that's what their oath said.

            Trump lawyer Little said she believes some of what Kohrs discussed in interviews was in fact part of deliberations, including when she talked about the credibility of some witnesses, decisions to recommend multiple indictments and the reasons why the grand jurors did not seek to bring Trump in to testify.

            Copeland, the former federal prosecutor and criminal defense attorney, noted that Kohrs was cautious — consulting a notebook where she'd written the judge's instructions before answering some questions — and didn't describe the discussion and debate that led to the special grand jury's outcomes.

            “I wish she really hadn’t talked about anything,” Copeland added. ""But she doesn’t talk about the deliberations. She doesn’t talk about the votes. She simply talks about other things that were happening in the grand jury session.” 

            University of Georgia law professor emeritus Ron Carlson said that if Kohrs had revealed the names of anyone for whom the special grand jury recommended charges, it's possible those people could try to use that as grounds to dismiss an indictment. But he wasn't optimistic about the chances for success.

            “I think that any kind of motion to dismiss an indictment based on her comments would have an uphill battle,"" Carlson said.ATLANTA (AP) — Almost as soon as the foreperson of the special grand jury in the Georgia election meddling investigation went public this week, speculation began about whether her unusually candid revelations could jeopardize any possible prosecution of former President Donald Trump or others.Emily Kohrs first spoke out in an interview published Tuesday by The Associated Press, a story that was followed by interviews in other print and television news outlets. In detailed commentary, she described some of what happened behind the closed doors of the jury room — how witnesses behaved, how prosecutors interacted with them, how some invoked their constitutional right not to answer certain questions.Lawyers for Trump say the revelations offered by Kohrs shattered the credibility of the entire special grand jury investigation. People hoping to see the former president indicted worried on social media that Kohrs may have tanked a case against the former president. But experts said that while Kohrs' chattiness in news interviews probably aggravated Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, who's leading the investigation, they were not legally damaging.Willis likely “wishes that this woman hadn’t gone on the worldwide tour that she did,"" said Amy Lee Copeland, a former federal prosecutor and criminal defense attorney in Georgia who’s not involved in the case. ""But is this a headache that is grinding the machine to a halt? It’s not. It’s just one of the many frustrations that attends the practice of law.”Trump's attorneys in Georgia, however, are jumping on the interviews.Drew Findling and Jennifer Little, who represent Trump in the Fulton County case, said they've had concerns about the panel's proceedings from the start but have kept quiet out of respect for the grand jury process. After Kohrs' interviews, they felt compelled to speak out.“The end product is, the reliability of anything that has taken place in there is completely tainted and called into question,” Findling said. But he also said he wasn't attacking “a 30-year-old foreperson.”“She’s a product of a circus that cloaked itself as a special purpose grand jury,"" he said.Findling and Little hadn't filed any challenges in the case by Thursday but said they're “resolute"" as to Trump's innocence and keeping their options open.“We're considering everything and anything to look after the interests of our client,” he said.The special grand jury was impaneled at the request of Willis, who is investigating whether Trump and his Republican allies committed crimes as they tried to overturn his narrow 2020 election loss in the state to Democrat Joe Biden. The panel didn't have the power to indict but instead offered recommendations for Willis, a Democrat, who will ultimately decide whether to seek charges from a regular grand jury.Willis’ office has declined to comment on Kohrs’ media appearances, other than to say they weren’t aware ahead of time that she planned to give interviews. Spokesperson Jeff DiSantis also declined Thursday to comment on the statements from Trump's attorneys.The former president's lawyers expressed concern that the special grand jury had been allowed to watch and read news coverage of the case and was aware of some witnesses' efforts not to testify. Kohrs said prosecutors told the jurors they could read and watch the news but urged them to keep open minds.Kohrs also shared numerous anecdotes from the proceedings that she found amusing and was very expressive in television interviews, sometimes laughing or making faces.“It’s not a joking matter,” Findling said. “It’s not a matter for giggles. It’s not a matter for smiles.”Findling and Little said the district attorney's office, which advised the special grand jury, should have better educated the grand jurors about the solemnity of the process and the rules and limitations.“That tone and that rhetoric begins from the top down, and that was set by the district attorney’s office,"" Little said.Trump himself criticized the process in a post on his social media network Wednesday, calling the Georgia investigation “ridiculous, a strictly political continuation of the greatest Witch Hunt of all time.” He expressed dismay at Kohrs “going around and doing a Media Tour revealing, incredibly, the Grand Jury's inner workings & thoughts.”Though Kohrs did not publicly name anyone the special grand jury recommended for possible indictment, Trump's lawyers said she seemed to implicate him in response to questions.They also said the judge overseeing the special grand jury could have instructed or strongly suggested that the grand jurors not speak publicly until the panel's full final report was made public.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819636,"Police: 'Random' shootings leave woman, child, reporter dead","A man riding in a car with his cousin shot and killed another passenger then returned to the same neighborhood near Orlando hours later and shot four more people, killing a journalist covering the original shooting and a 9-year-old girl, Florida police and witnesses said.

            Orange County Sheriff John Mina characterized the shootings Wednesday as random acts of violence. Mina said during a news conference that 19-year-old Keith Melvin Moses has been arrested and charged with first-degree murder in the initial shooting that killed Nathacha Augustin, 38, and that “numerous more charges” would follow.

            Spectrum News 13 identified the slain reporter as Dylan Lyons. Photographer Jesse Walden was also wounded. Mina said Walden has been talking to investigators while being treated at a hospital.











            The two were in an unmarked news vehicle on Wednesday afternoon covering the first homicide when a man approached and shot them, Mina said. The man then went to a nearby home where he fatally shot T’yonna Major and critically wounded the girl's mother. Officials have not released the mother's name.

            Mina said Thursday that investigators do not know the motive for any of the shootings. He said Moses is a known gang member but that the shootings didn't appear to be gang-related. It was not clear if Moses knew that two of the victims were journalists and Mina noted that their vehicle didn't look like a typical news van or feature the station's logo.

            The sheriff said when deputies arrested Moses they seized a Glock semiautomatic weapon that “was still hot to the touch, meaning it had just been fired, and there were no more rounds.”

            
                Body camera footage released by the sheriff's office shows Moses apparently resisting arrest. After deputies take him to the ground, Moses repeatedly yells that he can't breathe and that deputies are killing him, according to the video. Moses complained he was hurt and was taken to a hospital where he attacked medical staff, Mina said. He has since refused to speak with detectives.

            The Office of the Public Defender for Orange and Osceola counties, which is representing Moses, declined to comment.

            A man who called 911 after Augustin was shot told investigators that he was driving around smoking cannabis with her when he spotted Moses, his cousin, walking along a road. He said Moses “seemed down” so he offered him a ride, according to an arrest affidavit. Moses climbed into the backseat, behind Augustin, and about 30 seconds later the driver said he “heard a loud bang” and saw blood on Augustin’s face.

            He said he stopped and Moses fled. The driver called 911.

            He told investigators that Moses and Augustin didn’t know each other and that he didn’t hear the two exchange any words before the shot was fired.

            Deputies first went to the Pine Hills area, just northwest of Orlando, at around 11 a.m. Wednesday following the shooting of Augustin. About five hours later, 911 calls began coming in from the same area. Police found the journalists who had been shot being helped by a news crew from another station, WFTV.

            “I want to acknowledge the brave WFTV news crew who was there and witnessed the shooting and rendered aid to the victims until our deputies arrived,” Mina said.

            Lyons was born and raised in Philadelphia, and graduated from the University of Central Florida, the station said. Before joining Spectrum News, he worked for a station in Gainesville.

            “(Lyons) took his job very seriously. He loved his career. He loved what he did,” said Spectrum Sports 360 reporter and friend Josh Miller. “He loved the community, telling the stories of people, reporting on the news, and he was just passionate about what he did.”

            Rachel Lyons, the reporter’s older sister, is raising money for his funeral via GoFundMe. She wrote that Lyons would have turned 25 in March. He is also survived by his parents and fiancée.

            In a recorded message sent to parents Thursday, Pine Hill Elementary School Principal Latonya Smothers said the 9-year-old T’yonna was a “kind and beautiful young girl with an infectious smile.”

            During Thursday’s news conference, State Attorney Monique H. Worrell said her office had received multiple calls asking why Moses was not in custody from previous offenses.

            “This individual’s only adult offense was a possession of marijuana, 4.6 grams of marijuana, that my office did not charge because when you have a quantity that low, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement does not test the substance, and that means the state’s attorneys office cannot prove the case,” she said.

            Worrell said she was prohibited by Florida law from discussing any juvenile charges Moses might have faced. Earlier, Mina said Moses had faced at least two gun-related charges as a juvenile, including possession of a firearm by a minor and armed robbery.

            Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, said “our hearts go out” to the families of those killed in Wednesday's shooting

            “Too many lives are being ripped apart by gun violence,"" she said. ""The president continues to call on Congress to act on gun safety, and for state officials to take action at the state level.”

            Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis hasn’t publicly commented on the shooting. Earlier this week, the Republican governor and likely 2024 presidential candidate made stops in three major Democratic metro areas — New York, Philadelphia and Chicago — to extol tough-on-crime laws that he has signed in Florida and to criticize “woke” culture and anti-police sentiment.

            In recent months, DeSantis has expressed support for constitutional carry legislation, which would eliminate the requirement for concealed weapons permits in Florida. The phrase “constitutional carry” refers to the view that the right to bear arms guaranteed by the Second Amendment negates any need for a permit or license to carry a gun in public, either openly or concealed.

            Worldwide, 40 journalists were reported killed last year, plus another two this year before Wednesday, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. One of those was in the U.S.

            Jeff German, who covered politics and corruption for the Las Vegas Review-Journal, was found dead outside his home in September after being stabbed multiple times. Former Clark County Public Administrator Robert Telles, who had been a frequent subject of German’s reporting, has pleaded not guilty to a murder charge.

            In 2015, Virginia reporter Alison Parker and cameraman Adam Ward were shot and killed during their live TV broadcast for CBS affiliate WDBJ7. The gunman, a former reporter for the TV station, killed himself hours later.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819637,Inter's winning mood marred by on-field spats with teammates,"MILAN (AP) — Romelu Lukaku is back among the goalscorers, helping Inter Milan to victory in the Champions League and into second place in Serie A.

            But there are still tensions at Inter.

            Less than 10 days after Lukaku and Nicolò Barella had a fierce on-field argument, there was another ugly disagreement between Inter teammates during Wednesday’s 1-0 win over Porto in the Champions League.











            Inter goalkeeper André Onana and forward Edin Džeko screamed at each other in the first half, with Hakan Çalhanoğlu attempting to calm things down by covering Onana’s mouth. The situation appeared to arise after Onana started protesting with the referee and Džeko intervened.

            Onana laughed off the situation after the match, which gave Inter a one-goal lead over Porto heading into the second leg of the round of 16.

            “They’re just things linked to the tension of the match, but it all helps to improve the group and the quality of the team,” Onana said. “We’re all experienced players and every one of us has the right to say what they think, him as much as me.

            “But we now have to put it behind us. I’m the goalkeeper and I have to do my job. In the end we played very well and if getting annoyed like this we win games, then even better.”

            While Onana played well and had a number of fine saves — including a fantastic double stop when it was still 0-0 — Džeko had a below-par performance and reacted angrily when he was substituted in the 58th minute for Lukaku.

            “I also used to get angry when I was taken off during these type of matches,” Inter coach Simone Inzaghi said. “But it was enough for me to see how he leapt to his feet to celebrate Lukaku’s goal.

            “They are things that happen on the field, because of the adrenaline, because of these kind of nights. But we mustn’t forget what Džeko has done for us in these past 18 months. He hasn’t done much, but very much.”

            Inzaghi must decide whether to play Lukaku or Džeko up front alongside Lautaro Martínez when Inter travels to Bologna on Sunday in Serie A.

            Inter is in second place in Serie A, but could be 18 points behind Napoli when the match starts at Bologna because the league leaders visit Empoli the previous day.

            Roma, Milan, Lazio and Atalanta are all within six points of Inter in a tight battle for the Champions League qualifying spots.

            Lukaku has scored in back-to-back matches for Inter but that has taken his tally to only four goals because he has struggled with poor form and injury since returning to Italy from Chelsea in the offseason. Džeko has scored 11 goals in all competitions this season.

            Lukaku and Barella appear to have made peace after they were seen shouting and swearing at each other during a 0-0 draw at Sampdoria on Feb. 13. Inzaghi took both players off during that match and the club reportedly considered fining them.

            But Barella was one of the first to embrace Lukaku after providing the cross for the Belgium forward to score, with four minutes remaining against Porto.

            “I’ve always said that he’s the first player I’d pick to go to battle with,” Lukaku said. “I’m happy that he provided the assist, and we need to carry on in this manner.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819638,"Sliding vaccine sales, new costs, squeeze Moderna 4Q profit","Moderna’s fourth-quarter profit tumbled 70% as COVID-19 vaccine sales fell and the drugmaker caught up on a royalty payment.

            Heavy research and development costs also weighed on Moderna as the vaccine developer looks to strengthen an income statement currently dominated by its Spikevax coronavirus preventive shots.

            Moderna said Thursday that its cost of sales jumped nearly a billion dollars to $1.9 billion in the final quarter of 2022. That included a $400-million “catch-up” payment to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases for a new agreement on future royalty sales of the COVID-19 vaccine.











            Moderna scientists and government researchers worked together to develop the COVID-19 vaccine at the start of the pandemic. 

            More than 270 million doses of the original vaccine and boosters have been administered in the United States since regulators granted emergency authorization in late 2020, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 

            The Spikevax vaccine is Moderna's main source of revenue, outside of grants and money from collaborations. It brought in nearly $4.9 billion in sales in the fourth quarter. 

            That's a 30% drop from the final quarter of 2021, when the omicron variant of the virus was spreading rapidly and more people were getting either initial shots or boosters. 

            Research and development expenses also nearly doubled to $1.2 billion for the drugmaker. Moderna's pipeline of drugs under development includes a potential skin cancer vaccine combination it is working on with the drugmaker Merck & Co.

            Researchers are testing how Moderna's potential vaccine and Merck's immunotherapy Keytruda work in improving survival before cancer returns in patients who had advanced melanoma surgically removed. 

            The Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday gave that potential vaccine a “breakthrough therapy” designation, which is intended to speed the development and review of drugs that show signs of being an improvement over established treatments.

            Moderna expects to start a late-stage study this year. 

            Moderna also is one of several drugmakers developing a potential vaccine for RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus. Company officials told analysts Thursday they will submit that vaccine to regulators for approval in the first half of this year.

             Overall, the drugmaker’s profit fell to $1.46 billion, or $3.61 per share, in the final quarter of 2022. Total revenue dropped 29% to $5.08 billion.

            Analysts expected earnings of $4.60 per share on $5.02 billion in revenue, according to FactSet.

That included a $400-million “catch-up” payment to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases for a new agreement on future royalty sales of the COVID-19 vaccine.Moderna scientists and government researchers worked together to develop the COVID-19 vaccine at the start of the pandemic.More than 270 million doses of the original vaccine and boosters have been administered in the United States since regulators granted emergency authorization in late 2020, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The Spikevax vaccine is Moderna's main source of revenue, outside of grants and money from collaborations. It brought in nearly $4.9 billion in sales in the fourth quarter.That's a 30% drop from the final quarter of 2021, when the omicron variant of the virus was spreading rapidly and more people were getting either initial shots or boosters.Research and development expenses also nearly doubled to $1.2 billion for the drugmaker. Moderna's pipeline of drugs under development includes a potential skin cancer vaccine combination it is working on with the drugmaker Merck & Co.Researchers are testing how Moderna's potential vaccine and Merck's immunotherapy Keytruda work in improving survival before cancer returns in patients who had advanced melanoma surgically removed.The Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday gave that potential vaccine a “breakthrough therapy” designation, which is intended to speed the development and review of drugs that show signs of being an improvement over established treatments.Moderna expects to start a late-stage study this year.Moderna also is one of several drugmakers developing a potential vaccine for RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus. Company officials told analysts Thursday they will submit that vaccine to regulators for approval in the first half of this year.Overall, the drugmaker’s profit fell to $1.46 billion, or $3.61 per share, in the final quarter of 2022.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819657,Reality bites as Wall Street's rate cut dream disappears,"NEW YORK (AP) — After a long staring contest between Wall Street and the Federal Reserve, investors blinked first. 

            For months, Wall Street doubled down on bets that the Federal Reserve was bluffing about how far it would hike rates. Traders were even forecasting the Fed could begin cutting rates by the second half of this year, which can act like steroids for markets. 

            Through it all, Fed officials kept saying that they would ultimately raise rates past levels investors were anticipating and leave them there until the fight against inflation was definitely over. They said no rate cuts would likely happen until 2024 at the earliest. 











            Stakes were high in the standoff because higher rates can stamp out inflation, though at the risk of creating a recession because they slow the economy. Higher rates also hurt investment prices in the meantime.

            But a flood of data reports since the start of February have forced Wall Street to bring its forecasts for rates closer to the Fed's. Key among them were reports showing inflation at both the consumer and wholesale levels isn't slowing as quickly or as smoothly as hoped. 

            On top of those, the job market remains resilient even in the face of the most aggressive rate hikes in decades. And strong spending at U.S. retailers gives some assurance that the most important part of the economy, consumer spending, is still holding up. 

            Such stronger-than-expected data give hope that the economy is not about to fall into a recession. But they also may be fueling more upward pressure on inflation and encouraging the Fed to keep rates higher for longer, which raises the risk of a recession down the road. 

            That means expectations for rate cuts by the Fed by the end of this year have largely washed out of the market. The yield on the two-year Treasury, which tends to move with expectations for Fed action on rates, on Tuesday was near its highest level since 2007.

            That in turn is pressuring stocks, undercutting their big rally to start the year. For investors who piled into the market in January when stocks were rising, it's a reminder of a longstanding mantra on Wall Street: Don't fight the Fed.NEW YORK (AP) — After a long staring contest between Wall Street and the Federal Reserve, investors blinked first.For months, Wall Street doubled down on bets that the Federal Reserve was bluffing about how far it would hike rates.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819658,TikTok banned from EU Commission phones over cybersecurity,"LONDON (AP) — The European Union's executive branch said Thursday that it has temporarily banned TikTok from phones used by employees as a cybersecurity measure, reflecting widening worries from Western officials over the Chinese-owned video sharing app. 

            In a first for the European Commission, its Corporate Management Board suspended the use of TikTok on devices issued to staff or personal devices that staff use for work. 

            TikTok faces intensifying scrutiny from Europe and the U.S. over security and data privacy amid worries that the hugely popular app could be used to promote pro-Beijing views or sweep up users' information. It comes as China and the West are locked in a wider tug of war over technology ranging from spy balloons to computer chips.











            The EU's action follows similar moves in the U.S., where more than half of the states and Congress have banned TikTok from official government devices.

            ""The reason why this decision has been taken is to ... increase the commission's cybersecurity,"" commission spokesperson Sonya Gospodinova said at a press briefing in Brussels. “Also, the measure aims to protect the commission against cybersecurity threats and actions which may be exploited for cyberattacks against the corporate environment of the commission.” 

            Caroline Greer, TikTok's Brussels-based public policy official, tweeted that the suspension “is misguided and based on fundamental misconceptions.”

            “We have requested a meeting to set the record straight,” she said, adding that TikTok, which has 125 million users in the 27-nation European Union, is “continuing to enhance” its approach to data security. That includes opening three European data centers and minimizing data sent outside of the continent. 

            Commission spokespeople declined to say whether a specific incident triggered the suspension or what’s needed to get it lifted.

            Staffers would be required to delete TikTok from devices that they use for professional business by March 15, EU representatives said, but did not provide any details on how that would be enforced for people who use personal phones for work. 

            In Norway, which is not a member of the 27-nation EU, the justice minister was forced to apologize this month for failing to disclose that she had installed TikTok on her government-issued phone. 

            TikTok also has come under pressure from the EU to comply with upcoming new digital regulations aimed at getting big online platforms to clean up toxic and illegal content along with the bloc's strict data privacy rules.LONDON (AP) — The European Union's executive branch said Thursday that it has temporarily banned TikTok from phones used by employees as a cybersecurity measure, reflecting widening worries from Western officials over the Chinese-owned video sharing app.In a first for the European Commission, its Corporate Management Board suspended the use of TikTok on devices issued to staff or personal devices that staff use for work.TikTok faces intensifying scrutiny from Europe and the U.S. over security and data privacy amid worries that the hugely popular app could be used to promote pro-Beijing views or sweep up users' information.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819659,"Train crew had little warning before Ohio wreck, probe finds","EAST PALESTINE, Ohio (AP) — The crew operating a freight train that derailed in East Palestine, Ohio, didn't get much warning before dozens of cars went off the tracks, and there is no indication that crew members did anything wrong, federal investigators said Thursday as they released a preliminary report into the fiery wreck that prompted a toxic chemical release and an evacuation.

            
                U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg made his first visit to the crash site and took shots at former President Donald Trump, who had visited the day before and criticized the federal response to the train derailment. Their back-and-forth was the latest sign that the East Palestine wreck has become a hot-button political issue, prompting a rebuke from the head of the National Transportation Safety Board.

            “Enough with the politics. I don’t understand why this has gotten so political,” safety board Chair Jennifer Homendy, clearly exasperated, said at a briefing in Washington, D.C., on Thursday. “This is a community that is suffering. This is not about politics. This is about addressing their needs, their concerns.”











            The NTSB report, which laid out the facts that investigators have gathered to date, said crew members had no indication the train was in trouble until an alarm sounded just before it went off the tracks.

            An engineer slowed and stopped the train after getting a “critical audible alarm message"" that signaled an overheated axle, according to the report. The three-person crew then saw fire and smoke and alerted dispatch, the report said.

            “We have no evidence that the crew did anything wrong,” said Homendy, who announced a rare investigatory field hearing to be conducted in East Palestine this spring as officials seek to get to the bottom of the derailment's cause and build consensus on how to prevent similar wrecks.

            Investigators said the temperature of the failed wheel bearing increased by 215 degrees in a span of 30 miles (48 kilometers), but did not reach the temperature threshold that railroad company Norfolk Southern had set for an alarm to go off until just before the wreck.

            The train was going about 47 mph (75 kph), under the speed limit of 50 mph (80 kph), according to investigators.

            Outside experts who looked at the report said the system appeared to work as designed, from the spacing of the hot bearing detectors along the tracks to the operation of the sensors. 

            “There’s nothing in the NTSB report that surprises me at all,” said Dave Clarke, the former director of the Center for Transportation Research at the University of Tennessee. “I can’t see anything to really criticize about what happened or how the response was made.”

            Christopher Barkan, director of the Rail Transportation and Engineering Center at the University of Illinois, said the spacing of the sensors that recorded the temperatures of the Norfolk Southern train — 10 and 20 miles (16 to 32 kilometers) apart — is common in the industry.

            He said the detectors would not have notified the train crew of elevated bearing temperatures unless they met the threshold for action.

            “I don’t see anything wrong here, but we just don’t know,” Barkan said.

            Homendy said investigators would look at whether industry safety standards — including high-temperature alarm thresholds and sensor spacing — will need to change to prevent similar derailments.

            
                Norfolk Southern said the NTSB report showed the heat detectors worked as intended and the train crew operated “within the company's rules."" Nevertheless, the company said it would “need to learn as much as we can from this event” and “develop practices and invest in technologies that could help prevent an incident like this in the future.”

            The freight cars that derailed on the East Palestine outskirts, near the Pennsylvania state line, included 11 carrying hazardous materials. Villagers evacuated as fears grew about a potential explosion of smoldering wreckage.

            Officials seeking to avoid an uncontrolled blast intentionally released and burned toxic vinyl chloride from five rail cars, sending flames and black smoke into the sky. That left people questioning the potential health effects even as authorities maintained they were doing their best to protect people.

            In another sign of the environmental impact, the Ohio Department of Natural Resources said Thursday it now estimates spilled contaminants affecting several miles of streams killed nearly 44,000 fish, mostly small ones such as minnows. Its initial estimate was 3,500. 

            As NTSB released its preliminary findings, Buttigieg — who had been criticized for not coming to East Palestine earlier — went on a tour of the crash site and defended the Biden administration's response to the Feb. 3 derailment, which Trump had portrayed as indifferent and a “betrayal.""

            Buttigieg told reporters that if the former president — and current Republican presidential candidate — felt strongly about increased rail safety efforts, “one thing he could do is express support for reversing the deregulation that happened on his watch.”

            White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre excoriated “political stunts that we’re seeing from the other side” but did not say whether a trip by Democratic President Joe Biden was in the works.

            Another Biden administration official, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan, has been to East Palestine multiple times, most recently Tuesday as the EPA ordered Norfolk Southern to pay for the cleanup.

            With heavy equipment rumbling behind him, Buttigieg slammed Norfolk Southern and other freight rail companies for fighting regulations he said would “hold them accountable and the other railroad companies accountable for their safety record."" He pressed Congress to act.

            Heather Bable, who lives two blocks from the derailment site, said she’s relieved the government’s top brass is finally showing up.

            “We need that attention because we weren’t getting it. They should have been here all along,” said Bable.

            After throngs of residents lined the streets in pouring rain to welcome Trump on Wednesday, the reception for Buttigieg was decidedly more muted, with little fanfare around the village of just under 5,000 residents. Trump won nearly 72% of the vote in this heavily Republican region in 2020.

            Democratic U.S. Rep. Chris Deluzio, whose Pennsylvania district borders the derailment site, asked Norfolk Southern to expand the boundaries of the geographic zone in which it is providing financial assistance and testing. He asserted the current zone excludes many affected Pennsylvania residents and businesses, and said the company should commit to cleaning up soil and water up to 30 miles (48 kilometers) beyond it.

            “Norfolk Southern is failing to show any commitment to rebuilding lost trust in our community,” Deluzio wrote in a letter to Norfolk Southern's CEO. Providing additional resources “would help your company restore the sense of security that the Norfolk Southern train derailment and its aftermath destroyed.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819661,Lebanon's Central Bank governor charged with corruption,"BEIRUT (AP) — Beirut’s public prosecutor on Thursday charged the governor of cash-strapped Lebanon's Central Bank, his brother and an associate with corruption, Lebanese officials said. 

            The development comes one month after a European judicial delegation from France, Germany, and Luxembourg visited Lebanon to question Gov. Riad Salameh and dozens of other individuals over suspected corruption after five European state opened cases against him. 

            Since 2019, Lebanon has been in the throes of the worst economic and financial crisis in its modern history, rooted in decades of corruption and mismanagement. Three quarters of the country’s population of 6 million now lives in poverty.











            The 72-year-old Salameh was once hailed as the guardian of Lebanon’s financial stability but many now hold him responsible for the crisis, citing policies that drove up national debt and caused the Lebanese pound to lose more than 90% of its value against the dollar. 

            The governor, who has held the post since April 1993, still enjoys the backing of top politicians.

            According to two judicial officials, Beirut's Attorney General Raja Hamoush charged Salameh, his assistant Marianne Howaiyak, and his brother Raja Salameh with embezzling public funds, forgery, illicit enrichment, money-laundering, and violation of tax laws. The two officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media. 

            One of the officials told The Associated Press the charges raised Thursday may delay an anticipated, follow-up visit by the European judicial delegation. 

            Just before the announcement, a German Embassy delegation showed up at the Justice Palace in Beirut to meet with Lebanon's chief prosecutor, Ghassan Oweidat. But Oweidat refused to meet with them, citing his work schedule, the official said. 

            No further details were provided and it wasn't immediately clear if Oweidat's action was connected to Hamoush's charges against Salameh, which were announced shortly after.

            Activists, lawyers, and critics of Salameh have questioned the personal wealth the governor has amassed over the years, but he has repeatedly insisted he had earned it prior to his appointment as governor, while working as an investment banker for Merril Lynch for nearly two decades. 

            Salameh said his last salary as a banker was $2 million a year, and that he had a fortune worth $23 million, plus property he had acquired and “wisely invested” in to grow his wealth, before he became governor.BEIRUT (AP) — Beirut’s public prosecutor on Thursday charged the governor of cash-strapped Lebanon's Central Bank, his brother and an associate with corruption, Lebanese officials said.The development comes one month after a European judicial delegation from France, Germany, and Luxembourg visited Lebanon to question Gov.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819687,Mental evaluation ordered for man tied to Lyft driver death,"RUTHERFORDTON, N.C. (AP) — A judge has ordered a mental evaluation at the request of the attorney for a man who was arrested in North Carolina while driving the car of a dead Lyft driver from Florida and who is also charged with murder in a separate case.

            The order came Wednesday as Florida officials worked to extradite Matthew Scott Flores, who is a person of interest in the death of Lyft driver Gary Levin, WLOS-TV reported.

            Flores, 35, appeared in court for a probable cause hearing in Rutherford County, where he was arrested after a vehicle pursuit in multiple counties and charged with a parole violation, being a fugitive, felony speeding to elude arrest, and driving while impaired. His attorney requested the evaluation, and the judge granted it, the station reported.











            Flores has also been charged in Hardee County, Florida, with first-degree murder, grand theft auto, possession of a firearm by a felon, and tampering with evidence in the fatal Jan. 24 shooting of Jose Carlos Martinez, 43, in Wauchula, according to court records.

            Police were searching for Flores in that case by Jan. 30, when Levin, 74, disappeared after dropping off a customer in Okeechobee, a small city about 70 miles (110 kilometers) east of Wauchula.

            Levin’s Kia Stinger was spotted in Miami, Okeechobee and Gainesville, in north Florida, after his disappearance. The vehicle was stopped Feb. 2 in North Carolina, where a U.S. Marshals Service regional task force asked authorities to be on the lookout.

            A dead body found in Okeechobee was eventually identified as Levin.

            In North Carolina, District Attorney Ted Bell, who represents McDowell and Rutherford counties, told WLOS he plans to settle Flores’ North Carolina charges before he is sent to Florida.

            “We’re not a jurisdiction that dismisses charges,” Bell said after the hearing. “We have been in close communication with folks from the state attorney’s office in Florida. We’ll continue to keep close contact with them as things progress in this case, which way is the better way forward is for everybody. I’m not inclined to dismiss him, it just depends on what’s best overall.”RUTHERFORDTON, N.C.

His attorney requested the evaluation, and the judge granted it, the station reported.Flores has also been charged in Hardee County, Florida, with first-degree murder, grand theft auto, possession of a firearm by a felon, and tampering with evidence in the fatal Jan. 24 shooting of Jose Carlos Martinez, 43, in Wauchula, according to court records.Police were searching for Flores in that case by Jan. 30, when Levin, 74, disappeared after dropping off a customer in Okeechobee, a small city about 70 miles (110 kilometers) east of Wauchula.Levin’s Kia Stinger was spotted in Miami, Okeechobee and Gainesville, in north Florida, after his disappearance. The vehicle was stopped Feb. 2 in North Carolina, where a U.S. Marshals Service regional task force asked authorities to be on the lookout.A dead body found in Okeechobee was eventually identified as Levin.In North Carolina, District Attorney Ted Bell, who represents McDowell and Rutherford counties, told WLOS he plans to settle Flores’ North Carolina charges before he is sent to Florida.“We’re not a jurisdiction that dismisses charges,” Bell said after the hearing. “We have been in close communication with folks from the state attorney’s office in Florida. We’ll continue to keep close contact with them as things progress in this case, which way is the better way forward is for everybody. I’m not inclined to dismiss him, it just depends on what’s best overall.”",2023/2/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819688,U.S. applications for jobless benefits fall again last week,"The number of Americans filing for jobless aid fell last week as the labor market remains resilient in the face of the Federal Reserve's interest rate increases meant to cool the economy.

            Applications for unemployment benefits in the U.S. for the week ending Feb. 18 fell by 3,000 last week to 192,000, from 195,000 the previous week, the Labor Department said Thursday. It’s the sixth straight week claims were under 200,000.

            The four-week moving average of claims, which evens out some of the weekly volatility, inched up by 1,500 to 191,250. It's the fifth straight week that figure has been below 200,000.











            Applications for unemployment benefits are considered a proxy for the number layoffs in the U.S.

            Earlier this month, the Fed raised its main lending rate by 25 basis points, its eighth rate hike in less than a year. The central bank’s benchmark rate is now in a range of 4.5% to 4.75%, its highest level in 15 years. Chair Jerome Powell appeared to suggest that he foresees two additional quarter-point rate hikes.

            So far, the Fed’s hawkish interest rate policy has tempered inflation, but has had less impact on a robust U.S. job market.

            Two weeks ago, the government reported that employers added a better-than-expected 517,000 jobs in January and that the unemployment rate dipped to 3.4%, the lowest level since 1969. Analysts were expecting job gains of around 185,000.

            Job openings rose to 11 million in December, up from 10.44 million in November and the highest since July. For 18 straight months, employers have posted at least 10 million openings — a level never reached before 2021 in Labor Department data going back to 2000. In December, there were about two vacancies for every unemployed American.

            Though the U.S. labor market remains strong, layoffs have been mounting in the technology sector, where many companies overhired after a pandemic boom. IBM, Microsoft, Amazon, Salesforce, Facebook parent Meta, Twitter and DoorDash have all announced layoffs in recent months.

            The real estate sector has suffered the most from the Fed’s interest rate hikes, largely due to higher mortgage rates — currently above 6% — that have slowed home sales for 12 straight months. That’s almost in lockstep with the Fed’s rate hikes that began last March.

            About 1.65 million people were receiving jobless aid the week that ended Feb. 11, a decrease of 37,000 from the week before.The number of Americans filing for jobless aid fell last week as the labor market remains resilient in the face of the Federal Reserve's interest rate increases meant to cool the economy.Applications for unemployment benefits in the U.S. for the week ending Feb. 18 fell by 3,000 last week to 192,000, from 195,000 the previous week, the Labor Department said Thursday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819689,"1st baby pangolin in Europe born in Prague zoo, doing well","PRAGUE (AP) — A Chinese pangolin has been born in the Prague zoo, the first birth of the critically endangered animal in captivity in Europe, and is doing well after initial troubles, the park said on Thursday.

            For the first few days after the baby female was born on Feb. 2, park keepers were worried because it was losing weight.

            The reason was found to be that the mother, Run Hou Tang, didn’t have enough milk. Following consultations with experts from Taiwan, a program of artificial feeding with milk from a cat was introduced and the mother was stimulated to produce more of her own.











            That turned things around, with the zoo now expressing cautious optimism about the pup, which still has no name but has been nicknamed “Little Cone” because it resembles a spruce cone.

            “We have only overcome the first hurdle and others are still waiting for us,"" zoo director Miroslav Bobek said.

            The baby's birth weight was just 135 grams (4.76 ounces). Adults can reach up to 15 pounds.

            The Chinese pangolin is native to southern China and southeastern Asia and is one of the four pangolin species living in Asia, while another four can be found in Africa.

            Prague received the rare animal from Taiwan last year, becoming only the second European zoo to keep the species.

            Guo Bao, the male pangolin, and Run Hou Tang both came from the Taipei zoo, the leading breeder of the mammals that are hunted heavily for their scales and meat.

            It’s estimated that almost 200,000 were trafficked in 2019 because of the scales that are used in traditional medicine in Asia and elsewhere.

            They're difficult to breed in captivity because they require a special feed that includes drone larvae and need a particular humidity and temperature in their enclosure.

            The pangolins’ arrival in Prague came after the city decided to revoke a sister-city agreement with Beijing and signed a similar deal in 2020 with the Taiwanese capital, Taipei. That agreement, which has caused tensions with China, also included cooperation between the zoos of the two cities.

            Taiwan split from mainland China amid a civil war in 1949, but Beijing considers the self-ruled island part of its territory.

            The Czech government recognizes the one-China principle but Prague officials said they wanted to focus on cultural and other cooperation, not on politics.PRAGUE (AP) — A Chinese pangolin has been born in the Prague zoo, the first birth of the critically endangered animal in captivity in Europe, and is doing well after initial troubles, the park said on Thursday.For the first few days after the baby female was born on Feb. 2, park keepers were worried because it was losing weight.The reason was found to be that the mother, Run Hou Tang, didn’t have enough milk.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819695,UNESCO: Ukraine war will leave lasting damage on cultural heritage,"Roman Luckscheiter has been the Secretary-General of the German Commission for UNESCO since 2020. In an interview with DW, he talks about what is at stake for Ukrainian culture due to the war and how it can be preserved.Deutsche Welle: Mr. Luckscheiter, one year ago Russia's attack on Ukraine began. How do you remember that day?Roman Luckscheiter: I could hardly believe it possible in Europe, where people assume peace is a given, that suddenly we had a war.We first thought about the people, and were soon concerned about what this would mean for education and culture in Ukraine. On the day itself we published a statement in which we strongly condemned the war. Over the next few days, 40 UNESCO national commissions from other countries joined in. We were able to send a strong signal this way.What steps did UNESCO take afterwards?For UNESCO, the first step was to see what is being damaged and what the state of education and culture infrastructure was. Then we asked the crucial question: 'What can we do about it?' Germany's Federal Commissioner for Culture and the Media, together with the Federal Foreign Office, founded the ""Network for the Protection of Cultural Property in Ukraine,"" of which we, the German Commission for UNESCO, are a member. Civil society also became active and sent museums material to help protect cultural assets, from fire extinguishers to packaging supplies.We quickly sought contact with the Ukrainian National Commission of UNESCO to get an overview of the situation. We then evaluated satellite data and ensured that all cultural assets were marked with a blue shield emblem to signal that they were under special observation by the international community.Can you quantify the damage to Ukrainian cultural sites?The number of damaged cultural sites keeps rising. So far, it's over 3,000 schools, and 200 cultural institutions, including over 100 religious sites, 18 museums, 11 libraries and historical monuments. All of which have been severely damaged.We are especially concerned about World Heritage Sites, as well as the heritage under the Memory of the World Programme and Intangible Cultural Heritage. Structures are being destroyed that are permanently damaging living heritage — the identity of Ukraine. That's where we need to develop and provide expertise: To ask 'How do I evacuate cultural property,' 'How do I protect cultural property? and 'How do I prevent the illegal transfer of cultural property?' Education plays a central role here. Fortunately, Ukraine was already very digitized before the war. Working with Google, UNESCO provided 50,000 computers in order to assist with digital education. We also have mechanisms at UNESCO to support the free press. Recently, Odessa was put on the World Heritage List.How did that happen?It showed that UNESCO was quick to respond, because Odessa was put on the list of 'World Heritage in Danger' at the same time. That means the city needed additional attention, protection assistance and financial support for its reconstruction.Were there protests from the Russian side and is there currently contact with the UNESCO Commission in Russia?There is no contact with the UNESCO Commission of Russia or other state agencies in Russia. But it is important to us that civil society stays in contact, that a dialogue continues to exist in science and the arts. We don't want Russia's culture to enter into this conflict, because we consider the Russian language and Russian music to be great treasures that must not be affected — either during or after the war.What can UNESCO do for the Ukrainian artists who have fled to Germany, for example?The question is how we keep in touch with Ukrainians working in the arts and culture sector, since in the future we will need to partner with them on reconstruction. In the future, the connection to Ukraine in the education and cultural sectors will become much stronger. This is precisely where UNESCO networks are extremely helpful.We have established the ""Contact Point for Cultural Diversity"" in the German Commission for UNESCO. It monitors how those working in the arts and culture field have arrived in Germany. It examines how the wide variety of offers given to them by the government and civil society work.  We want to learn which offers and resources will be needed in the future and to see what works and what doesn't.Will you take criminal action if there is destruction of world cultural heritage?There is indeed cooperation between UNESCO and the International Criminal Court in The Hague. This cooperation has been successful before, such as when the mausoleums were damaged in Timbuktu. The mastermind behind it was sentenced to nine years in prison and had to pay a fine of millions. This shows that the meticulous monitoring of damage by UNESCO can lead to legal consequences.We must not forget that the heritage of humanity is at stake!We also need to build expertise in the legal handling of the illegal transfer of cultural goods. This is being done at the national levels, which are responsible for this. UNESCO is supporting this with appropriate expert committees that could be called upon.What do you see at the heart of this war, which is also being waged against culture and art?The great danger of war is that beyond the humanitarian catastrophe, the families and childhoods which have been destroyed, a severely damaged cultural landscape is also left in its wake, and national identity is erased.Especially in times of great conflict and trauma, culture and art serve as an instrument to help us cope, to find means of expression and enter into new dialogs.The interview was conducted by Andrea Horakh in German.",2023/2/23,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819696,UN General Assembly readies vote on Ukraine peace resolution,"The UN General Assembly was debating Russia's invasion of Ukraine for a second day in a special session on Thursday in New York.At the conclusion of the session, either later on Thursday or potentially early on Friday, member states will vote on a motion put forward by Germany calling for ""a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in Ukraine in line with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations"" as soon as possible.Judging by similar past votes in the chamber since Russia's invasion a year ago, the motion is likely to pass. But diplomats were scrambling to try to secure as widespread support for it as possible after significant portions of the international community abstained from voting on past measures.General Assembly resolutions are not binding and carry mainly symbolic weight at the United Nations. However, unlike at the Security Council, Russia cannot unilaterally veto them.You can watch the session live on DW's YouTube feed here.As well as calling on parties to the conflict and the international community to seek to broker peace, the resolution also calls for Russia to withdraw from Ukraine's territory.The document ""reaffirms its commitment to the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders, extending to its territorial waters.""The measure also ""reiterates its demand that the Russian Federation immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw all of its military forces from the territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders, and calls for a cessation of hostilities.""The resolution does not go into any details on how peace or peace negotiations might be achieved, short of saying through member states and international organizations ""redoubling"" their efforts. It also calls for war crimes perpetrators to face international prosecution.Before heading to New York for the session, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said she was hoping for ""the world to raise its voice loudly and clearly so that it is also finally heard in Moscow.""""What the international community is demanding could not be simpler,"" Baerbock said. ""Stop the Russian attacks, protect the civilian populations, honor Ukraine's territorial integrity by withdrawing Russian troops, and accountability for the crimes committed.""Majority support for the motion should be assured, and probably by a very healthy margin.The last comparable resolution at the General Assembly, condemning Russia's unilateral declaration of having annexed Ukrainian regions after holding unrecognized referendums on joining Russia, passed overwhelmingly.In total, 143 UN members, about three in every four, voted in favor. Only five — Russia, Belarus, North Korea, Syria and Nicaragua — voted against.But most notable were the 10 countries absent from the vote, and the 35 that abstained. Abstentions included G20 powers like China, India and South Africa, as well as much of Africa and Central and South Asia.A German diplomat told the Reuters news agency on condition of anonymity on Thursday that they were not sure how India intended to vote this time, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government seen as probably the most significant that could still be swayed.The overall tally was similar, with 141 countries voting in support, for the first major UN resolution last March condemning Russia's invasion.The special session, expected to last two days but with the potential to last three if needed, kicked off on Wednesday at the UN.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba and Russia's ambassador to the United Nations Vasily Nebenzya were among the most notable speakers.""As I said from day one, Russia's attack on Ukraine challenges the cornerstone principles and values of our multilateral system,"" the UN's Guterres said, also calling the invasion an ""affront to our collective conscience.""Ukraine's Kuleba, meanwhile, said: ""Never in recent history has the line between good and evil been so clear. One country merely wants to live. The other wants to kill and destroy."" He also said that Russia relocating Ukrainian children to Russia amounted to ""genocide.""Russia's UN ambassador Nebenzya called on members to oppose the motion, arguing it was one-sided. He also accused Ukraine's NATO allies of exacerbating the conflict, claiming there were parallels to World War II.""This is a war in which, as it was also the case 80 years ago, involves treacherous and powerful enemies who want to take over our land and subjugate us,"" Nebenzya told the UN General Assembly. ""German tanks will once again kill Russians,"" he said, referring to the German-made Leopard battle tanks several European countries have promised to send to Kyiv.The vote coincides with a flurry of diplomacy on all sides around the one-year anniversary of the war breaking out.US President Joe Biden was returning from Poland after also making an unannounced trip to Kyiv this week. Russian President Vladimir Putin delivered a major speech on Tuesday. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez made a surprise visit to Kyiv on Thursday.msh/sms (AFP, AP, dpa, Reuters)",2023/2/23,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819697,Tech gives overseas Uyghurs chilling insights into plight of relatives,"Last May, a cache of leaked files and photos from hacked official databases in China's northwestern Xinjiang region shed new light on human rights abuses by Beijing toward the region's Uyghur minority.Images showing teenagers and old women among those detained at the internment camps offered horrific insights into the Chinese government's brutal persecution of the Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities.The files were obtained by an anonymous source who hacked police computers and leaked them to Adrian Zenz, director of China Studies at the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation in the United States.On February 10, Zenz and his team revealed the full extent of the leaked files, which included information of approximately 830,000 individuals and thousands of images.In addition to the new revelations, Zenz has also introduced a new search tool that allows Uyghur people in the diaspora to enter their family members' Chinese ID, number or their names in Chinese spelling, to look for relevant information about them.""This is the information that the Chinese government has refused to make public, and now that it has been leaked to us, we are letting the Uyghurs search as if they were searching a Xinjiang police computer,"" Zenz told DW. ""It's like an imperfect window into the file system of the Xinjiang police.""The new set of data is by far the largest leak of files, Zenz said, and it provides an unprecedented ""close-up view"" of the campaign of mass internment and other atrocities that have been taking place in Xinjiang since 2016. Most of the data is primarily from Shufu County in Kashgar and Tekes County in Ili and covers the period between 2016 to 2018.Zenz told DW that he believes the data covers almost the entire population from these two locations, and it shows a large number of people from these places are in some form of detention.""The evidence shows that the campaign of mass internment really happened,"" he said, adding that the dataset offers an overview of the scale of the mass internment. ""It's more representative than what we have had before.""According to the United Nations, an estimated 1 million Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in Xinjiang have been detained in countless internment camps across the province.Last August, the United Nations Human Rights Office released its Xinjiang Report, suggesting that China's large-scale internment of Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in Xinjiang may amount to ""crimes against humanity.""However, the Chinese Foreign Ministry refuted the assessment of the report, calling it a patchwork of disinformation and a political tool serving US and other western countries' interests in containing China through the topic.For some Uyghurs abroad, the search tool allows them to learn about their family members' fate, including when they were arrested, which camps were they sent to and for how long have they been sentenced.""Twenty-nine members of my family were listed in the files, and with a heavy heart, I had to go through the data, because I think we have to tell the world what's really been happening in Xinjiang,"" said Mamatjan Juma, the deputy director for Radio Free Asia's Uyghur service.""I question whether what I'm doing is right or wrong. When I see my family members are persecuted due to what I'm doing, it makes me feel guilty, but it also shows how brutal the Chinese government is. They punish anyone they want by association. It's a very complicated, painful, and haunting feeling for me to live with,"" he told DW.Juma's search results show that one of his brothers was sentenced to 14 years while the other two brothers were arrested and detained in the camps at one point. What haunts him the most was learning about his father's death, which was described as the result of multiple complications.""When I called home in 2017, my mom told me my father passed away 10 days before,"" he told DW. ""Later on, I learned that my father died when two of my brothers were locked up and I didn't know where my younger brother was at the time. What haunted me was that we were not with my father when he died.""While the discovery of information about his family made Juma somewhat relieved, Abduweli Ayup, a prominent Uyghur linguist and activist living in Norway, feels like information he obtained from the leaked data has caused him to lose 40 years of his life in his hometown Kashgar. ""First, I entered my niece's name and information showed that she was categorized as a fugitive in September 2018, and it also indicated that she would be arrested when she returned to Xinjiang,"" he told DW.In 2021, Ayup confirmed that his niece, Mihray Erkin, died in custody 10 months after she was arrested by police. Additionally, he found that his younger sister, Sajida Ayup, who teaches geography at a high school, was charged with being a ""double-faced"" official. ""If someone who works for the Chinese government continues to practice his or her cultural belief, he or she would be accused of being double-faced,"" he explained.In addition to his niece and his younger sister, Ayup also found that his brother was sentenced to 14 years in prison. ""I searched for information about my cousins, my friends, my neighbors, and they were all arrested,"" Ayup told DW. ""Basically, I lost 40 years of my life in Kashgar. Those are the people I know, worked with or were friends with. For me, without the people I love, my county is empty.""When Marhaba Yakub Salay first learned about the new search tool, she only intended to see if she could find additional information about her sister Mayila Yakufu, who was sentenced to 6 and a half years in 2020 under the charges of ""financing terrorism."" Despite Salay's family providing proof that Yakufu was merely wiring money to them so they could buy a house in Australia, Yakufu remains in prison.""I searched my sister's ID number, but nothing came up,"" she told DW. ""Then I checked information about all of my family members, and I found information about my niece and nephew. I was in shock. They haven't been taken by the Chinese government, but I'm still concerned about what would happen to them.""According to Salay, her nephew, who was only 12 at the time, was designated as a ""Category 2"" person who is a ""highly suspicious accomplice"" in public security and terrorism cases. Additionally, her niece's and nephew's files showed that they may have traveled to one of the 26 suspicious countries including Egypt and Afghanistan.However, Salay said the only place that the two of them and her sister had traveled to outside of China was Malaysia when they visited Salay and the rest of the family. ""The list said they had traveled to all these sensitive countries, but that's totally wrong,"" she said.As her nephew will soon turn 18, Salay is concerned that the authorities may take him away at some point.""I'm not sure what would the Chinese authorities do to him,"" she told DW. ""I haven't managed my sister's situation and she is still in prison. If anything happens to my niece and nephew, I won't be able to take it.""Edited by: John Silk",2023/2/23,,

The splinter group of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) had claimed responsibility for two attacks in recent years.Officials identified the wounded officer as Detective Chief Inspector John Caldwell.

His young son was with him when the shooting happened.""That shows the absolute callous nature of this attack, and it is utterly disgusting that the gunmen carried out this attempted murder in front of crowds of adults and children,"" McEwan said.""The gunmen fired from close range in the busy sports training area, which could also quite easily have killed or seriously injured children who were present at the time of the shooting,"" he added.fb/rt (AFP, AP, Reuters)",2023/2/23,,
