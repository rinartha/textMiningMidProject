https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851699,"With Griezmann on fire, Atletico is hottest team in Spain","BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — Antoine Griezmann excelled at the World Cup as France’s do-it-all man in the midfield to help the 2018 champion reach a second straight final.Since falling short against Argentina in Qatar, Griezmann has continued to play his best soccer in several years for Atletico Madrid.His Spanish league-leading eight assists, along with his team-high nine goals, have played a major part in Atletico quietly becoming the hottest team in the league over the last two months.Atletico struggled early in the season. Diego Simeone's side flopped out of European competition by finishing its Champions League group in last place. It also quickly fell out of touch with the Spanish league front-runners and lost in the Copa del Rey quarterfinals.But that cup defeat to Real Madrid on Jan. 26 was its last defeat overall, and it came right when Atletico started a winning streak in the domestic league, where it hasn't lost since Jan. 8.Atletico is in third place before playing fifth-placed Real Betis on Sunday as the league resumes after an international break.The improvement in play by Atletico has had a lot to do with Griezmann being available. In the opening months of the campaign, Atletico limited the minutes of its versatile attacker amid a contractual dispute with his former club Barcelona that was not settled until October.Griezmann rose to the elite of European soccer while playing for Atletico from 2014-19. He then spent a frustrating two years at Barcelona, and returned to the capital in 2021. He has restored his status as Atletico's star player.Last week, Griezmann helped France start qualification for the 2024 European Championship with two wins. He scored in a 4-0 victory over the Netherlands and played the full game in a 1-0 win over Ireland.Atletico is well out of the title race as Barcelona looks like a champion-in-the-making after it beat Madrid before the international break. That 2-1 victory at Camp Nou left Barca 12 points clear of Karim Benzema’s team and a full 17 points ahead of Atletico.Atletico could, though, have put itself in position to challenge Madrid for a second-place finish, a prize whose greatest payoff would be sticking it to its top crosstown opponent.Betis arrives at Metropolitano Stadium on its own six-round unbeaten streak, which came amid its elimination from the Europa League at the hands of Manchester United.But Betis midfielder Sergio Canales will start serving a four-game suspension for saying a referee “premeditated” a red card issued to Canales in a prior game.Atletico striker Memphis Depay will also miss the game against Betis due to a thigh injury he picked up with the Netherlands.WARMUP FOR CUP CLASSICBarcelona can add to its commanding lead when it visits last-placed Elche on Saturday. Madrid hosts Valladolid on Sunday.The powerhouses will then meet at Camp Nou on Wednesday in the second game of their Copa del Rey semifinal. Barcelona won the first game 1-0.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851700,"Pakistani Taliban target police, kill 4 in roadside bombing","PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) — Militants in Pakistan targeted the country's police force in two attacks in a volatile northwestern province on Thursday, killing four officers and wounding six, officials said. The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for both attacks.In one attack, police say a roadside bomb struck a vehicle carrying officers, killing four of them. The officers were reinforcements responding to an attack earlier in the day on a police station in Lakki Marwat, a town in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province bordering Afghanistan. Six officers were wounded in the attack on the station.Local police officer Ashfaq Khan said a search was underway for the attackers. Pakistani Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif condemned the attack, saying he was saddened by the ""martyrdom"" of the targeted officers.“The sacrifices of our police officers in the war against terrorism are unforgettable,"" he said.The Pakistani Taliban said in a statement that one of the slain officers, Iqbal Mohmand, was targeted because he was behind the arrest and killing of some of their fighters.The militant group is known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP, and is separate but allied with Afghanistan’s Taliban. There has been an increase in attacks by the Pakistani Taliban since they unilaterally ended a cease-fire with the government.TTP has been emboldened since the Afghan Taliban seized power in Afghanistan in 2021 when U.S. and NATO troops were leaving the country after 20 years of war. Many TTP leaders and fighters have found sanctuaries in Afghanistan since the Taliban takeover there.The latest violence comes days after Pakistan’s elections oversight body delayed legislative elections in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces due to a spike in militant attacks and the government's refusal to provide the necessary funds, security forces and polling staff. The government cited financial constraints as the reason.The elections, which were to be held on April 30, have been postponed to Oct. 8.",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851701,"Bubba Wallace rebuilds confidence on track, community off it","A slow start to the NASCAR Cup Series season — two crashes and an engine failure through six races — has Bubba Wallace looking internally for the steadiness he needs to pull himself out of this early slump.It was his mother who encouraged Wallace to do some self-reflection.“It's day by day, right? Just got to be a better version of myself,” Wallace told The Associated Press this week. “My mom had said to me, ‘You know, if you want things to change, you got to change yourself.’ So I'm just trying to change myself and be more active, working out, eating better, and just trying to have a better mindset so Richmond should be good for us.”Yes, Wallace and NASCAR head next to Richmond Raceway for a Sunday short track race at a venue that has not been one of Wallace's stronger tracks. His career-best finish at Richmond was 12th in 2019 when he drove for Richard Petty. He was 13th last fall in his new 23XI Racing ride.But this weekend represents more to Wallace than a chance to show how far 23XI has come since its 2021 launch. The two-car team celebrated its first win of the season last week with Tyler Reddick at Circuit of the Americas and qualified three cars for the season-opening Daytona 500.Wallace will use Richmond, a rare NASCAR stop at a facility located in a fairly urban area, for his second annual “Bubba's Block Party."" The free Friday night event is a community-focused NASCAR initiative aimed at bringing awareness, access and engagement to the sport within the Black community.The food truck village will feature Black-owned businesses, and there will be live entertainment including iRacing, video games and a live pit stop demonstration by Wallace's Toyota crew. Wallace will host a “fireside chat” to discuss both his career and his attention on promoting diversity and inclusion across the sport.Wallace, who is from Alabama, in 2020 successfully called on NASCAR to ban the Confederate flag at its events. He is the only full-time Black driver at NASCAR's top level.“Richmond is in the heart of a minority market, a diverse market, and I feel like a lot of those people don't show up at the racetrack,” Wallace said. ""I wanted to provide an environment that’s a Friday night cookout-type style vibes at a racetrack, and get them out and encourage them to come out and cheer on their favorite driver — don’t even have to be me.“I think just getting them to feel welcome to walk in their own shoe, be comfortable in their own skin and have a great time just like they could go to NBA games, an NFL game, I think that’s important. We have to make our markets feel just as welcoming as others.”Bubba's Block Party was born after the national social justice reckoning in 2020 that thrust Wallace into the spotlight on issues he was still only just beginning to understand. He's not been shy to use his platform, but it's come with detractors and scrutiny, including a noose found in his Talladega Superspeedway garage stall after his call for the banning of the Confederate flag.The FBI ruled the garage pull was indeed fashioned as a noose but that it was a coincidence it was in Wallace's stall and he was not the victim of a hate crime. Detractors, including then-President Donald Trump, falsely accused Wallace of orchestrating the event.But it was that year that sparked an urge in Wallace to demand change in a predominately white, Southern sport.“Our sport change has changed for the better. We removed the Confederate flag, and I felt like a lot of people from a diverse background, minority background, started tuning in,” Wallace said. ""They tune in enough to where they actually come out. And I’ve had numerous people in the last two years now say, ‘Hey, man, I’m here because of what you’ve done.’ And that’s powerful.“I think being able to show face and give back to the community that have stood up and supported me is super important.”After the party, it's back to focusing on racing, where Wallace is coming off back-to-back disappointments.He spun without contact from anyone else two weeks ago at Atlanta on the 10th lap, hit the wall and finished 27th. At COTA, he showed early speed but was involved in an early crash and a 37th-place finish. Wallace seemed defeated in his post-incident interview.“Trying my hardest not to go down that slippery slope of self-doubt here. Two weeks in a row making rookie mistakes. Six years in Cup, need to be replaced,"" he said.His mom gave him encouragement to stop wallowing in self-doubt, and the block party sends him to Richmond with a mission bigger than anything he does on track. Asked by the AP how his confidence was headed to Richmond, Wallace was expressionless: “Find out,” was all he said.___AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/30,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851704,Final Four: Last year's bluebloods are this year's no-names,"HOUSTON (AP) — One short year ago, college basketball was getting ready for the game of a lifetime: North Carolina vs. Duke at the Final Four.And this year? Well, to put it kindly, who the heck are these guys?The NCAA Tournament, the annual event that has told and sold and made marketing gold out of the story of underdogs and busted brackets has, for 2023, produced an extreme rendition of what happens when all that cherished unpredictability plays itself out to the end.In one Final Four meeting Saturday, it will be San Diego State against Florida Atlantic. In the other, it will be Miami vs. UConn.“I expect the prognosticators to pick us fifth at the Final Four,” Florida Atlantic coach Dusty May said in a nod to the reality that nobody really expected the Owls, or any of these teams, to be here.Of the four programs descending on Houston this week, only one has ever sniffed a Final Four before. It's the first time in 53 years that has happened.With its four national titles and some famous names from the past, including Jim Calhoun, Kemba Walker and Rip Hamilton, the name “Connecticut” certainly should ring a bell, even if it might not tread all the way into true blueblood territory.Miami? That was a program that was literally shut down for 14 years in the 1970s and 1980s due to lack of interest. The school was too busy building a football program that would become (in)famous for winning with a certain panache.May's Florida Atlantic program? It's a relative new kid on the block, a member of Division I since 1993 that is based in the retirement community of Boca Raton, a locale better known for its 4:30 dinner specials than its 7 p.m. tipoffs.San Diego State? In their defense, maybe this shouldn't be the Aztecs' first Final Four. In 2020, they were 30-2 and generally slotted in as a No. 1 seed, albeit still an underdog to a stacked Kansas team that was the odds-on favorite. Then COVID hit and wiped that season off the boards.“There are a lot of really good teams in college basketball, and the difference between winning and losing is paper thin,” San Diego State coach Brian Dutcher said.Will anyone, outside of the truest of diehards, bother to watch?As of Thursday, a pair of seats in the nosebleed section for Saturday's doubleheader — the most-anticipated day on the college hoops calendar — were going for around $100 each on the secondary market. A year ago, shortly after the Duke-Carolina matchup was set, the average price for those same seats nearly doubled to $800 a ticket.There has been a lot of debate and even some handwringing about how one of America's greatest sporting events produced a 4 seed, two 5s and a 9 — for a seed total of 23, which is the second-highest in history — that between them boast not a single McDonald's All-American nor one consensus top-30 recruit.The transfer portal, which allows players to come and go from school to school without having to sit out a year, might be the best explanation. Miami coach Jim Larranaga called it basketball's form of “speed dating,” a get-rich-quick scheme that, with the right timing, chemistry and luck, can make a roster very good (or very bad) very quickly.Some other possibilities: an NCAA selection committee that some say is divorced from reality; the ever-shifting landscape caused by name-image-likeness (NIL) deals that give players more leverage (and money); and, for sure, an abundance of flawed teams — including Alabama, Houston and Kansas — that were overvalued and placed at the top of the heap this year.But before jumping to grand conclusions about matchups like these becoming the “new normal” at the Final Four, former Duke star and current TV analyst Jay Bilas reminds us that we are a scant 365 days removed from a completely different sort of get-together.""I love the one about the narratives that you don't need those McDonalds guys to win,” Bilas said. “OK, so don’t recruit the best players, and see how that goes for you. I just don't understand how all this gets this way.”A year ago, the tournament felt perfect. The country got its dose of Cinderella — namely, when 15 seed Saint Peter's made a first-of-its-kind run into the Elite Eight. Then, a sense of perfectly timed normalcy took over.Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski got to close out his career at the Final Four, and the end came against none other than archrival North Carolina. Joining those power programs in New Orleans last year were Kansas and Villanova, two more of the country's great programs with seven national titles between them. The total seed value of those four teams: 13, with most of that accounted for by the Tar Heels, who got in as an 8 after knocking out Saint Pete's.So, will 2023 be remembered as the year when chaos took over for good, or just a minor blip in the proceedings while all those Jayhawks and Blue Devils reload?“The tournament is about a lot of different things to a lot of different people,” Bilas said. “Some people love it for the brackets, some people love it for the basketball. But no matter who's in the Final Four, the bandwagon is always wide open, and you can jump on it whenever you want.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851705,Pakistan ups security as 11 killed in Ramadan food stampedes,"ISLAMABAD (AP) — Pakistan on Thursday boosted security after 11 people were killed in stampedes at free wheat distribution centers for the poor since the start of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan last week, officials said.Cash-strapped Pakistan last week launched the initiative to distribute free flour among low-income families to ease the impact of record-breaking inflation and soaring poverty during the holy month.But as crowds swelled at the distribution centers across the country, many would panic in fear whether they would be able to get the flour, triggering the deadly stampedes. Eight deaths were reported in northwestern Pakistan and three in the eastern Punjab province.Observant Muslims abstain from food and water from dawn to dusk during Ramadan and then, as the sun sets, break their daytime fast with iftar, the evening meal.The flour distribution initiative was launched by Pakistan's Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif as his government is facing the worst economic crisis amid a delay in getting a key $1,1 billion tranche of a $6 billion bailout package originally signed in 2019 with the International Monetary Fund.“So far, the Punjab government has distributed 20 million bags of flour,” said Mohsin Naqvi, the head of the caretaker government in Punjab.Along with Punjab, additional police were also deployed Thursday in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Haroon Shah, a government adviser in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa told The Associated Press that the stampedes happened because desperate “people were impatient” and were not sure whether they will get the flour.“We have enough flour in our stocks,” he said.On Thursday, housewife Zubaida Bibi was smiling as she came away from an Islamabad distribution center with three sacks of flour after having waited for hours.The South Asian nation is currently going through one of its worst economic crises amid depleting foreign exchange reserves and increasing cost of living. The weekly inflation is 45%, unseen since the country got its independence from British colonial rule in 1947.Rising food costs and soaring fuel bills have raised fears of public unrest. Economists say Pakistan is currently facing a default-like situation mainly due to a delay in the release of the loan from the IMF. They say the cost of energy and prices of dairy products, maize, fruit, vegetables, and grains have doubled in the past year, and farmers are struggling to get fertilizers at higher rates for crops.“This government of Shahbaz Sharif is worse than his predecessor Imran Khan,"" said Mohammad Afzal, a villager who lives near Islamabad.A former cricket star turned Islamist politician, Khan served as prime minister 2018-2022 before he was ousted in a no-confidence vote in Parliament last April. He has since campaigned as opposition leader against Sharif's administration. Sharif claims the economic problems stem from Khan's bad governance.Sharif visited a flour distribution center in Islamabad earlier this week. No violence was reported during his visit. Information Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb said Sharif was at the scene and wanted “to ensure uninterrupted"" distribution of the flour to the people. She said 4.2 million people had already received free flour.___Khan reported from Peshawar, Pakistan.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851706,Camila Cabello celebrates grandmother's novel and strength,"MALAGA, Spain (AP) — Camila Cabello credits the strong women in her life for her success as an artist and a person. So it was only natural that she was there to celebrate her grandmother's milestone — the publication of a novel.The Spanish-language book, “Los boleros que he vivido” (""The Boleros that I Have Lived""), has been a decades-long dream project of Cabello's grandmother, Mercedes Rodriguez.The “Havana” singer traveled last week to Málaga, Spain, to celebrate and help promote Rodriguez's book, which tells the story of a woman who separates from her husband after many years of marriage. The story across its 329 pages weaves through the woman's efforts to reunite with her daughter and granddaughters in the U.S. — a tale that mirrors events in the lives of Cabello's family.“In the end I finished it very quickly, really, very quickly, because it’s the story of my life and I still have a good memory,” Rodriguez said.As Rodriguez, 75, discussed the novel, Cabello held her hand. “My family is such a huge part of who I am, it’s such a big part of who I am as an artist, it’s such a big part of my music,” Cabello said.Music is like a character throughout the novel — every chapter is named after a bolero, the music genre of romantic lyrics originated in Cuba that became very popular in the first half of the 20th century throughout Latin America. For Rodriguez, music is essential: “It is something that no human being can stop living with in order to be happy,” she said.Of her granddaughter's success, Rodriguez said, “It’s in her blood, she has photos at 2-years-old with a microphone in her hand and with the radio on.“I hear her sing at a concert, for example, and I even get breathless, it excites me so much, I just can’t explain it to you,"" She said. ""It’s something I’ve never felt in my life, seeing her on stage singing or hearing a record of her.”Rodriguez's favorite Cabello song, “Never Be the Same,” stirs up intense emotions. “I can’t hear it because I make a fool of myself, I immediately start crying,” she said.Other family favorites include music of their native Cuba, as well as Latin pop stars as Alejandro Sanz or Luis Miguel, and a superstar favored by Cabello's grandmother: Ed Sheeran.Cabello said that she feels a special bond with the women of her family, a lineage that stretches back to her grandma’s grandmother, who Rodriguez called Isabelita.“I feel like I wouldn’t be like who I am today if it weren’t for the fact that my family has such strong women. All women who have had strong personalities and who have done things their way,"" she said, citing how her great great grandmother was “thinking really ahead of her time in terms of sexuality and relationships.” (Cabello notes it's a theme her grandmother explores in “Los boleros que he vivido.”)“My mom has always been the same way, she,” Cabello said, referencing Rodriguez, ""has always been the same way, my sister, who’s 15, is somebody like that too. Very independent thinkers.”",2023/03/31,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851733,Unlocking the code to Beethoven's life through his hair,"Ludwig van Beethoven: A musical genius, but socially a curmudgeon. When the composer wrote his famous  Ninth Symphony, he was already deaf. He was plagued by many illnesses.As a result, he had requested a post-mortem autopsy in order to research his ailments.In 2014, an international team of researchers started working on sequencing Beethoven's genome for more clues into his condition. When their new findings through DNA analyses of Beethoven's hair were recently published, the media eagerly jumped on the story offering more insight into the life of the famous classical composer.One of the findings concluded that Beethoven had the liver disease hepatitis B. This solved the mystery of his death, some media reports argued. Other articles noted that Beethoven might not be genetically a Beethoven at all.In short, the findings were turning Beethoven's biography upside down.But even though the results are astounding, researchers have not reached the same conclusions as the media — or at least not with the same conviction.Christine Siegert, head of the Beethoven Archive in Bonn, and a colleague have gathered the historical background for the research team.The story about Beethoven's locks of hair, which provided the DNA, played a major role. There are still 32 known examples of the locks worldwide.""The culture of remembrance was very different in the 19th century than it is today, when everyone can take selfies,"" Siegert told DW. ""Back then, people liked to give away locks of hair as friendship gifts.""The researchers had eight such locks at their disposal, five of which showed matching DNA. One of the locks of hair was contributed by the Beethoven Museum in Bonn. The house where he was born in 1770 is now a museum and archive, where scholars have kept examining the composer's legacy since his death in 1827.""Our curl has a good provenance and it is very likely that it is authentic,"" says Siegert. Beethoven gave the curl to the Streicher family of piano makers in 1820 while he was still alive.One account by Gerhard von Breuning, the son of Beethoven's close childhood friend Stefan von Breuning, demonstrates how popular the practice of collecting locks was. When Beethoven was laid out in an open coffin after his death, many fans came and cut a lock from his hair. Siegert says that Breuning was too late to get his own: ""When he arrived, Beethoven had already had all his hair cut off. He had no more hair on his head.""It is not possible to say with absolute certainty that the hair used to sequence the DNA is authentic, asserts Siegert. After all, she says, there was a buoyant trade after Beethoven's death, including in alleged Beethoven hair. ""Historical research is always an approximation,"" says the musicologist.One of the eight curls examined, the famous ""Hiller curl"" — long firmly believed to be Beethoven's after Ferdinand von Hiller was allowed to take it from the body the day after the composer's death — turned out to be a woman's hair after the latest DNA analysis, to the surprise of the researchers. In 2007, a high lead content had been detected in said curl and it was wrongly assumed that Beethoven had died of syphilis — a disease that was treated with lead-containing medicine at the time.The new analyses, which also looked for pathogens, were able to detect hepatitis B. Beethoven had repeatedly complained of back pains, and his DNA shows that he was susceptible to liver disease. Whether Beethoven ultimately died from his hepatitis disease, however, cannot be proven.The idea for the research project came from Tristan Bregg, who had worked for the Beethoven Center in California. Three of the hair samples studied came from there, but only one of them was among the five that showed matches in DNA.As a master's student, Bregg was able to enlist Professor for Archaeogenetics Johannes Krause in his idea. Krause specializes in analyzing historical DNA at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany. Bregg then earned his doctorate in archaeology at Clare Hall University in Cambridge, where he conducted research on Beethoven's DNA. It took eight years until the results of the international research team could now be published in the scientific journal Current Biology.""We had to bring in cooperation partners with different expertise,"" Krause explained to DW. For example, a medical geneticist from the University of Bonn, where people are familiar with complex diseases. ""Then we brought in genealogists from Belgium, who studied Beethoven's family tree to identify possible relatives.""They uncovered another surprise. Comparing the DNA of the ""Beethovens"" living in Belgium today, they found that they were related to each other, but there was no DNA from the composer. ""We were surprised by this family secret, which shows that Beethoven was not genetically descended from the Flemish Beethoven line, but we don't know which generation is responsible,"" Begg explains in a separate YouTube video.What ultimately moved the research forward were the high-quality machines that could decode Beethoven's genome, the blueprint for the human that resides in every cell. ""Fifteen years ago, sequencing machines decoded about 100 to 200 DNA sequences per day, and today we have machines that can decode 20 billion DNA sequences per day,"" says Krause.Usually, old bones serve as the basis for analysis, but that was not possible with Beethoven. ""You could have exhumed Beethoven to perform such a genetic analysis with his bones,"" Krause says. ""We approached the Central Cemetery in Vienna, but they decided against supporting the project.""To decode Beethoven's genome, the researchers needed larger amounts of hair. Fortunately, Australian Kevin Brown possessed a suitable clump. ""The lock offered itself because it had a relatively large amount of hair and the owner of this lock said that he was happy to sacrifice the hair for the research,"" Krause says. To get the DNA, the hair had to be dissolved, which means the collector's lock would no longer exist.The archive in the Beethoven Museum was able to keep some of its curls and continues to keep them under lock and key. Christine Siegert of the Beethoven Archive in Bonn doubts whether the biographies on Beethoven would have to be rewritten according to the latest findings. ""People will include that in future publications. And it's also interesting for medical historians,"" she says. But nothing can be proven, she adds, because even the five matching hair samples could hypothetically not be Beethoven's. ""If at some point we find out what happened, we will include that in our biographical writings.""For Johannes Kraus, however, the project is over for the time being. There would be no shortage of hair in the process. Since the publication of the results, Krause has already been offered three more supposed hair samples from Beethoven for research purposes.This article was originally written in German and adapted by John Silk.",2023/03/30,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851735,Vatican says Pope Francis recovering well in hospital,"Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said on Thursday that the pope had ""recovered well "" with his condition improving as he  continues receiving treatment at the Gemelli hospital.According to the statement, the Pope Francis ""rested well during the night. His clinical picture is gradually improving, and he is continuing his planned treatment.""""This morning after breakfast, he read some newspapers and resumed work. Before lunch, he went to the little chapel of the private [hospital] apartment where he prayed, and he received the Eucharist.""On his official Twitter account, Francis wrote that he was ""touched by the many messages received in these hours and I express my gratitude for the closeness and prayer.""The pope was first admitted to Gemelli hospital in Rome on Wednesday for what the Vatican initially said were scheduled medical check-ups.Afterwards it was revealed he had complained of breathing difficulties and was diagnosed with a respiratory infection, with his Thursday schedule cleared.The Vatican said he had tested negative for COVID-19 but required ""a few days"" of hospital treatment.The latest health issue raises fresh concerns over the several ailments affllicting the pontiff.Francis at times runs short of breath and is generally more exposed to respiratory problems. Part of one of his lungs was removed in his early 20's as a seminarian in Argentina.The pontiff also suffers from diverticulitis, a condition infecting or inflaming the colon.  He had a surgery in 2021to remove part of his colon at Gemelli hospital.He also has a problem with his right knee and switches between using a cane and a wheelchair in his public appearances.The latest hospitalization has renewed speculation over a possible resignation on health grounds. The pontiff has however said he would resign if only he was gravely ill or felt he was losing mental clarity.Typcially, pontifical resignations are extremely rare. Francis in 2013 became the first pope in centuries to take over the job from a living predecessor, Benedict XVI.dmn/msh (AFP, dpa, Reuters)",2023/03/30,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851736,Bankers convicted in Switzerland over Putin money laundering,"Four bankers have been convicted in Switzerland of having assisted a longtime ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin hide funds in bank accounts in the country.The court found them guilty of failing to exercise the necessary oversight with regards to the accounts. They have been handed suspended jail sentences that carry with them fines of 741,000 Swiss francs ($809,000; €743,400).The men, who were not identified under Swiss privacy norms, helped Sergey Roldugin deposit millions in discrete bank accounts between 2014 and 2016. The Swiss government has called Roldugin ""Putin's wallet"" in the past for his alleged money laundering for the Russian leader.A concert cellist, he is also the godfather of Putin's eldest daughter.All four defendants worked for Gazprombank, a privately-owned bank that functions as the main channel for Russian oil and gas payments.A spokesman for the bank said that the men would appeal their conviction.Judge Sebastian Aeppli said that the bankers had ignored obvious red flags that the money was being funneled to Putin, in violation of international sanctions.Aeppli said it had been ""proven beyond a doubt"" that Roldugin was not the real owner of the accounts, which were closed in 2016.The judge added that the men should have conducted further investigations when the accounts were active given the amount of assets involved.It should have raised suspicions not only because Roldugin was on a list of sanctioned individuals, the judge said, but also because he is a musician and not a businessman, and the amounts in these accounts totaled upwards of 10 million Swiss francs.Other red flags were also neglected, such as the political and economic circumstances in Russia, the use of middlemen and offshore and intermediary accounts, Aeppli said.Prosecutor Jan Hoffmann called it an ""important sign"" against money laundering in Switzerland.The Kremlin had previously denounced the allegations that the money was being funneled to the president, calling it a case of ""Putinophobia.""es/msh (AP, Reuters)",2023/03/30,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851737,"Pakistan: HIV-positive adults, children face stigma","Ajmal Khan and Kulsoom Bibi (names changed at their request to protect their privacy) have been living as outcasts in the northwestern Pakistani province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa since testing positive for HIV almost 10 years ago.They live in a conservative community. Most of their neighbors believe that HIV can only be transmitted by illicit sex. The poor couple from Peshawar city deny involvement in extramarital practices and say they contracted the virus via an infected syringe, but most relatives and acquaintances reject this and refuse contact with them or subject them to discrimination.Out of their four underage children, a girl and a boy have also tested HIV-positive. They are among the province's 394 HIV-positive children, who, if not treated, could develop acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).The couple is now increasingly worried about the future of healthy kids.""We're constantly living in the fear of dying soon, so if this fear comes true, what will become of my little children not affected by this disease, especially the daughter, in this ruthless society? This thought gives us sleepless nights,"" Khan, 45, told DW.Alarmingly, more and more children are testing positive for the virus in the Pakistani province.According to official figures shared with DW by Dr. Asghar Khan, the project director of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government's Integrated HIV, Hepatitis and Thalassaemia Control Program, 168 children were diagnosed with HIV between 2020 and 2022. Of them, 112 were boys and 56 girls.The program registered 22 such boys in 2020, 25 in 2021 and 65 in 2022. Also, 10 girls were recorded in 2020, 13 in 2021 and 33 in 2022. Together with previously known cases, the official number of HIV-positive children is now close to 400.The rising incidence is not limited to children, as more and more men, women and transgender people are diagnosed with the virus. The province has recorded 6,064 HIV cases since 2005 — mostly from the Peshawar district (1,055), tribal areas bordering Afghanistan (903), and the Bannu district (722). A total of 864 people have lost their lives to the virus.Officials attribute the recent rise in confirmed cases to mandatory HIV testing before surgeries as well as better public awareness.""In 2018, our [Khyber Pakhtunkhwa] health department notified HIV testing as compulsory for people needing any surgical procedure. The initiative led to the reporting of high incidence,"" said Dr. Asghar of the HIV Control Program.""Also, public awareness of HIV, easy access to testing and treatment as well as strong coordination among and collaboration of health facilities and bodies also contributed to it.""Ajmal Khan said that he, his wife, and his children used to live in a joint household with their extended family, but were evicted after an HIV diagnosis.""We suffered social rejection, discrimination, and stigma and felt like pariahs among our own people but had to put up with all that for ourselves and our children. Though unwell, I work with a carpenter as a daily wager, while my wife stays indoors managing the household,"" he said.A 34-year-old HIV-positive woman has moved together with her infected 7-year-old child to a village in Charsadda district, miles away from her family. She is under treatment, but hasn't told any other villagers about her disease to prevent eviction.""Actually, my husband carried the virus and transmitted it to us but asked me to keep it a secret for the sake of his and his family's honor in society, which largely believes it spreads by unlawful [extramarital] sex only,"" she told DW on condition of anonymity.""I broke the news after his death six years ago but to my utter shock and despair, my in-laws forced me out of the village, while my real brothers didn't help me either, so I came here and make tea for a living.""To ensure her privacy, the woman travels alone to an HIV treatment center in the district to receive medication.She is worried about her son and doesn't believe he would survive in the cruel society without her.The government has set up HIV centers across the province with outpatient departments. They counsel and treat patients, and give them anti-retroviral drugs free of charge. The complimentary medication is provided to people from distant areas for six months, and to locals for three months.Dr. Saadia Khan, who heads the HIV center at the public sector Hayatabad Medical Complex in Peshawar, said that more and more HIV-positive people were approaching health centers in the province for treatment.""Some patients are in such a bad condition that they're immediately admitted to the outpatient department, while others are sent home after examination and counseling with medicines. All that is free of charge for being funded by the government or donors,"" she said.The doctor raised the alarm by disclosing that growing HIV cases are seen in children with thalassemia — a blood disorder characterized by a lack of hemoglobin — possibly due to poor blood screening.She also warned that, in addition to HIV spreading from parents to unborn children, as well as via sexual contact, drug addicts are also at risk if they use discarded syringes. Even skin cuts by infected razors or blades can lead to an infection.Edited by: Darko Janjevic",2023/03/30,,

Gross profit increased 11.5% to approximately HK$114.0 million. During the year, basic earnings per share is HK$3.51.   Business Review    The Group is an established contractor based in Hong Kong, providing professional fitting-out services and repair and maintenance services with the qualification as a registered electrical contractor, subcontractor and minor work contractors.   The Group's technologies and technical solutions, including but not limited to, virtual reality technology, digital design services and three-dimensional laser scanning, were successfully launched in the market. The realisation of opportunities arising from these technologies and technical solutions will add value to the Group and diversify the business of the Group in the future.   The Group is principally engaged in the provision of fitting-out services and repair and maintenance services for residential and commercial properties in Hong Kong. During the year, fitting-out services is accounted for approximately 98.9% of the total revenue, representing approximately HK$810.1 million.

As at 31 December 2022, the Group had a total of 46 fitting-out projects on hand, which included fitting-out projects that have commenced but not yet completed and fitting-out projects that have been awarded to the Group but not yet commenced, with an aggregate total contract sum of approximately HK$3,822 million.

The aggregate total contract sum of these 28 projects amounted to approximately HK$3,451 million (31 December 2021: 25 projects: approximately HK$2,865 million).   Business Prospect    The economy of Hong Kong in 2022 was dampened by the severe fifth wave of the COVID-19 outbreak starting in late 2021 and further by the deteriorated external environment and tightened financial conditions, including but not limited to the increase in interest rates and supply chain bottlenecks. In spite of the removal of strict COVID-19 restrictions in Hong Kong recently, the Group still expects to encounter great challenges in the short term. However, as supported by the 2022 policy address of Hong Kong, the Government of the HKSAR will develop land resources in a persistent manner to satisfy the housing demand. Therefore, the Group expects that the business of the Group will remain stable in the fitting-out industry in Hong Kong in the long term. The Group will devote necessary resources to further increase its market share if appropriate.   The Group's integration of technologies and technical solutions with big data into home design and fitting-out projects was successfully delivered to the market. The Group would be determined and committed to create a one-stop home furnishings solution to serve the industry for the purpose of cost savings and efficiency improvement. The Group will assess any opportunities arising from the application of the technologies and technical solutions with big data so as to deliver better services to our customers.   Looking ahead, the Group remains prudent and optimistic about the prospects of the Group's business in the long term. The Group will consider closely monitoring its working capital management, as well as cautiously examine the latest developments in its core business. The Group will adjust its business strategies as needed to ensure corporate sustainability.   Mr. Ng Chi Chiu, Chairman of the Group, CEO and Executive Director, said, ""The Group has always utilized technology to enhance the quality of our fitting-out services. In recent years, we have made significant breakthroughs in time management, quality control, and cost-effectiveness by leveraging technology. We aspire to integrate big data technology into our home design and fitting-out projects, providing people with the convenience of a technology-driven lifestyle.""  Hashtag: #Superland

Podium level construction is completed; Efforts are now pivoted to building the hotel tower upwards. Soft opening targeted to launch before the end of 2024. Grand opening to be in 2025.         Russia: Given recent geopolitical tensions in Russia, the development of Phase II Tigre de Cristal is inevitably slowed down as a prudent business decision      A LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN    Dear valued shareholders and stakeholders,   I would like to express my sincere appreciation for your unwavering support of LET Group. As we navigate the complexities and opportunities of today's market, our Group is currently undergoing asset restructuring. Through restructuring our assets with the highest and best use principle in mind, we will concentrate our resources IN the Philippines gaming market, specifically on the development of the Westside City project. We firmly believe that this project is the cornerstone of our future success, as we strive to seize new growth opportunities in the Philippine integrated resort market.   On the financing side, the project is going to secure a loan from a local financial institution through LET Group's subsidiary, Suntrust Resort Holdings, Inc., that provides the necessary capital to deliver a world-class integrated resort experience unparalleled in the region. A local bank's approval of the project, based on its familiarity with the local business environment, can be regarded as a vote of confidence that bolsters investor sentiment. This serves as a recognition for Westside City Project, as well as for the Group's managerial expertise and operational capabilities. Such resounding validation by the local industry is an indicator of the Project's promising prospects. By partnering with a preeminent local conglomerate, we can navigate the local landscape with care and cultural competence while bringing LET Group's unrivalled expertise in Asia gaming to the table.   Relative to more mature gaming markets in Asia, the Philippines presents significant potential for the growth of a novel destination for integrated resorts. Local Filipinos and expatriate patrons contribute more than a third of the Philippines' gross gaming revenue. On top of that, the country's proximity to major economies with a high propensity for spending including Japan, South Korea, and countries in Southeast Asia offers a competitive advantage to regional customers with considerable disposable income to spend. As the Asian middle class expands rapidly, demand for premium travel, leisure, and entertainment experiences is at an all-time high. It is our goal to capture a share of this burgeoning demand with a world-class integrated resort destination in the Philippines. By providing unparalleled quality, a range of amenities, and superior services, we aim to establish LET Group as the premier choice for Asia's patrons.   Westside City Project is our large-scale flagship development that will introduce a unique and unequalled mix of hospitality, gastronomy, retail, and gaming to Manila's Entertainment City. This project represents our most significant growth opportunity, underpinned by a compelling investment case — especially in light of challenges encountered at our other integrated resort in Vietnam. In contrast, the Philippines permits local Filipinos to frequent integrated resorts, conferring a degree of stability and resilience, which is why developing the mass market segment will be a key component of the Westside City Project. This effect has been evidenced at our Tigre de Cristal integrated resort in Russia. While we plan for the project's entertainment facilities and amenities, we emphasize the preferences of the mass market segment, aiming to position Westside City Project to become a leading iconic integrated resort in South East Asia that tailors to the tastes of the mass market. Westside City Project is exceptionally positioned to deliver strong and stable financial outcomes across our portfolio of integrated resorts in the future.   I would also like to reassure shareholders that the decision to slow down the development at Tigre de Cristal Phase II was a prudent business decision reached after careful consideration and analysis. The current commercial climate in Russia poses difficulties in guaranteeing a consistent return on investment to our parent company listed in Hong Kong. Our focus remains centred on identifying and capturing unique growth opportunities, and I am confident that the Philippine integrated resort market holds considerable promise for LET Group's future.   I recognise that investing in a company requires significant financial and time commitment to realise returns. Nonetheless, I ask that you place your faith in our vision and join us on this exciting journey. With formidable gaming sector expertise, a gifted leadership and employee base, and compelling avenues for growth, LET Group stands ready to embark on a new chapter of success in Asian gaming with the opening of the Westside City Project soon.   Thank you for your enduring partnership and support.   Sincerely,   Mr. Lo Kai Bong   Chairman  LET Group Holdings Limited    Market Overview   Russia   According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), Russia's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) contracted by an estimated 3.4% to 4.5%[1] in 2022. Despite the contraction, the country's economy performed better than initially expected due to the strong fiscal response and the increase in energy prices[2]. Meanwhile, the tourism industry was experiencing a recovery, with only approximately 73,000[3] visitors to Primorsky Krai for the full year of 2022. However, the long-term impact of the Western sanctions resulting from the Russia-Ukraine conflict remained a concern for the country's economy and its tourism industry.   The Philippines   The Philippine economy continued to grow in 2022, with a 7.7% increase in GDP, reaching PHP19.9 trillion[4](approximately US$363.4 billion). The entertainment industry, particularly the integrated resorts in Manila, continued to benefit from local demand. According to the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR), The Gross Gaming Revenue (""GGR"") from licensed casinos in the country grew by 91% year-on-year to PHP214.3 billion (approximately US$3.9 billion) at the end of 2022[5]. In particular, Entertainment City casinos accounted for 87% of the Total Licensed Casino GGR in 2022, and has recovered to 93% of the level of GGR compared to 2019. In 2022, 2.65 million visitors arrived the Philippines, translating to PHP209.0 billion (approximately US$3.7 billion) in tourism revenue for the country, a significant increase from 2021 as borders were closed back then[6]. The majority of tourists arrived from the United States, South Korea, Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom in 2022.   Vietnam   Vietnam's economy grew by 8.02%[7] in 2022, the highest rate recorded in the 2011-2022 period[8]. The increase is three times the growth in 2021 and exceeded the target of 6-6.5% set by the Government. The country's tourism industry also continued to recover, with a total of 3.6 million foreign arrivals[9] for the full year of 2022, 23 times to that of 2021 yet this still only reflected approximately 20% of the total number of arrivals in 2019. 70% of foreign tourists are from Asia while the rest are from Europe and the US[10].   Development Update   Westside City Project, Philippines   The construction of the exterior of the podium which would hold the future gaming facilities has now been completed. The focus of the construction team is to continue building upward. The soft opening is targeted towards the end of 2024, with the grand opening aimed at 2025.   When all phases of the Westside City Project are ready, it will consist of:         Approximately 300 tables         Over 1,300 electronic gaming machines         Over 450 five-star hotel rooms including state-of-the-art party rooms and suites         All sorts of amenities that fit our LET theme Leisure, Entertainment and Taste, including the privileged LET Club, Cigar and Wine bars, night clubs, Wellness Spa, and a Director's Club         Approximately 1,000 car park spaces      Westside City Project will be integrated with the shopping malls, theatres, restaurants, and shopping streets, etc. to be built by our local partner Westside/Travellers. They will also build additional hotel rooms, a shopping mall, a Grand Opera House, restaurants, a theatre district and an additional of approximately 2,000 car park spaces.       Figure 1 Construction progress at Westside City Project in March 2023     Tigre de Cristal, Russia   Due to the unpredictable and volatile geopolitical tensions, the Company has made the difficult decision to slow down the development of Phase II Tigre de Cristal. We are now taking a conservative approach to investing in Russia.   The Company has been exploring alternative opportunities in other regions, as well as potentially looking for strategic partners who might be able to bring value in terms of operating the gaming and hotel business in Far East Russia.   Hoiana, Vietnam   In Hoiana, Hoiana Phase I including Hoiana Shores Golf Club, the casino, Hoiana Hotel & Suites and New World Hoiana Hotel are now operational.   Outlook   2022 has proven itself to be a year of both promise and peril for the Group. While the gradual easing of travel restrictions and recovering consumer sentiment bode well for the Group's integrated resorts in Vietnam and the Philippines, geopolitical tensions and the ongoing public health crisis introduced a measure of uncertainty. However, despite formidable challenges, the Group has emerged resilient with a reinvigorated brand and a diverse portfolio of integrated resorts across Asia, affording us the ability to deliver maximum value to shareholders when difficult times turn its head away.   As a publicly listed company in Hong Kong with operations spanning across the Philippines, Vietnam, and Russia, the Group is well-positioned to mitigate risks through geographic diversification and has harnessed extensive expertise in integrated resort development. In comparison to other established Asian gaming markets, the Philippines gaming market represents a substantial potential for growth as an innovative luxury destination. With a considerable portion of GGR contributed by local and expatriate patrons, and its proximity to major regional economies with high disposable income, the Philippines offers a compelling value proposition in the growth of Asian gaming. As the Asian middle class grows at an incredible pace, demand for world-class integrated travel, leisure, and entertainment experiences has reached unprecedented heights.   In Suntrust Resorts Holdings, Inc., our Philippines team is actively recruiting seasoned gaming executives on the ground to bring this vision to fruition. Since the completion of the construction of the podium level where the main gaming halls will be located, efforts have pivoted to the construction of the hotel tower, with plans to launch a soft opening before the end of 2024 and a grand opening in 2025. By providing the finest quality, a range of lifestyle amenities, and exceptional services, the Group aims to cement its position as the preferred choice for regional gaming patrons. With the support of a local financial institution, the Group will obtain the necessary capital to execute this strategy. Through the partnership with a leading local conglomerate, the Group is set to deliver a unique blend of cultural sensitivity and Asian gaming prowess navigating through the business environment in the Philippines while offering an unmatched experience for regional patrons.   In Vietnam, Hoiana has seen a spike in business volumes and occupancy rates ever since its soft opening in mid-2020, breaking successive records month after month. As an integrated five-star resort offering a blend of a luxury beachside resort and an authentic Vietnamese cultural experience, Hoiana's unique value proposition serves as a magnet for foreign tourists and mass market gaming patrons alike. Although record performance is a notable achievement, its foreigner-only admission policy to the gaming floor currently acts as its key impediment to growth, with visitation hinging on the status of regional travel restrictions. However, as constraints ease and visitation regains momentum, we are confident that Hoiana will cement its stature as Vietnam's premier hospitality destination.   In Russia, Tigre de Cristal has seen a resurgence in the local mass gaming business and slots business in 2022, achieving company records since its first opening despite multiple challenges in the operating environment. By procuring supplies locally and expanding into new markets such as Japan and South Korea, Tigre de Cristal is gradually adapting to persistent geopolitical tensions. However, due to the unpredictable business climate, the Group has adopted a cautious investment approach and has decided that inevitably, the development of Tigre de Cristal Phase II will be slowed down as a prudent business decision.   In summary, while we regard the future with prudent optimism, our primary focus remains at the Philippines integrated resort. With a dedicated team and the necessary funding ready to be deployed, we are confident in delivering a world-class experience and capturing the market's unique opportunities. We remain committed to our vision and will overcome challenges that may emerge.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851740,Top UN court rejects Iranian bid to free assets frozen by US,"THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — The United Nations’ top court on Thursday rejected Tehran’s legal bid to free up some $2 billion in Iranian central bank assets frozen by U.S. authorities to be paid in compensation to victims of a 1983 bombing in Lebanon and other attacks linked to Iran.In a 10-5 majority ruling, the International Court of Justice said it did not have jurisdiction to rule on the Iranian claim linked to the central Markazi Bank.The world court's vice-president, Kirill Gevorgian, said the majority “upholds the objection to jurisdiction raised by the United States of America relating to the claims of the Islamic Republic of Iran” related to the bank.In a complex, 67-page judgment, the world court also found that some other U.S. moves to seize assets of Iran and Iranians in the United States breached a 1955 treaty between the countries and said they should negotiate compensation. If they fail to reach a number, they will have to return to the Hague-based court for a ruling.But the largest part of the case focused on Bank Markazi, and its frozen assets of $1.75 billion in bonds, plus accumulated interest, that are held in a Citibank account in New York. The court said that it did not have jurisdiction based on the 1955 Treaty of Amity because the protections it offers do not extend to central banks.Both countries largely voiced satisfaction at Thursday's decision.In Washington, Deputy State Department spokesman Vedant Patel said that while the U.S. was disappointed with some aspects of the ruling it was pleased on the whole.“Broadly we believe that today’s decision is a major blow to Iran’s case,” Patel told journalists.An Iranian foreign ministry statement lauded the decision as “an indication of the strength and reliability of (Iran’s) demand,” the official IRNA news agency reported on Thursday.It said Tehran would use “all diplomatic, legal and judiciary means"" to pursue its demands.At hearings last year, Iran cast the asset freeze as an attempt to destabilize the Tehran government and a violation of international law.Iran took its claim to the world court in 2016 after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that money belonging to Iran’s central bank could be used as compensation for the 241 American troops who died in the 1983 bombing, which was believed to be linked to Tehran.After the bombing of the a U.S. military base in Lebanon, a second blast nearby killed 58 French soldiers. Iran has denied involvement, but a U.S. District Court judge found Tehran responsible in 2003. The judge's ruling said Iran’s ambassador to Syria at the time called “a member of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard and instructed him to instigate the Marine barracks bombing.”At last year's hearings, U.S. legal team leader Richard Visek told judges they should invoke, for the first time, a legal principle known as “unclean hands,” under which a nation can’t bring a case because of its own criminal actions linked to the case.However, the court's ruling Thursday rejected that defense.Iran argued the asset freeze was a breach of the 1955 Treaty of Amity, which promised friendship and cooperation between the two countries. The U.S. and Iran have had no diplomatic relations since militant students took over the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979.The judges accepted U.S. lawyers' contentions that the frozen central bank assets were state holdings not covered by the treaty, which Washington terminated in 2018 in response to an order by the International Court of Justice in a separate case to lift some sanctions against Iran.The court’s judgments are final and legally binding.",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851741,IOC finally makes US hurdler a 2012 Olympics champion,"LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) — American runner Lashinda Demus officially became an Olympic champion on Thursday, at the age of 40 and more than a decade after the 2012 London Games.Demus was formally reallocated the gold medal in the 400-meter hurdles by the International Olympic Committee because of the disqualification of Natalya Antyukh in fallout from the Russian doping scandal.On the London track on Aug. 8, 2012, Demus finished 0.07 seconds behind Antyukh, who was implicated last year in the second doping case of her career.Historical evidence recovered from a Moscow testing laboratory database let track’s Athletics Integrity Unit decide last October to strip Antyukh of all her results from July 2012 through June 2013.Demus will receive a gold medal from the IOC to add to her world title won in 2011. However, she was denied during her career the commercial benefits of calling herself an Olympic champion.Zuzana Hejnová of Czechia was upgraded to silver, and the bronze was reallocated to Kaliese Spencer of Jamaica, the IOC said.When the AIU ruling was made five months ago, Antyukh was already serving a four-year ban in a previous case that disqualified all her results from 2013 to 2015.___More AP coverage of the Paris Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851742,Israeli author: Netanyahu legacy imperiled by judicial plan,"TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — The Israeli historian, philosopher and best-selling author Yuval Noah Harari said Thursday that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu may go down in history as the man who destroyed Israel.Harari, who has been vocal about his opposition to a proposed judicial overhaul by Netanyahu’s right-wing government, said the long-serving prime minister has divided the country to preserve his political longevity.This has caused rifts that will be difficult to heal, Harari said.“If Netanyahu had retired after two terms in office or after, say, eight years. I think even though I didn’t like many of the things he did, I think he would have retired as one of the great leaders of Israel,"" Harari said during an interview with The Associated Press in Tel Aviv.“Now, his legacy is he is the certainly the divider of Israel, the person who divided the Israeli nation against itself. And I hope ... we don’t get there,"" he said. “But he could go down in history as the person who destroyed the state of Israel.”Harari is among the scores of academics, business leaders and military figures, both active and retired, to speak out against the judicial overhaul.Netanyahu, who is on trial for corruption charges, says the plan is needed to rein in the powers of an interventionist judiciary.But critics say it will push the country toward authoritarianism by weakening an independent court system and concentrating power in the hands of Netanyahu and his allies. Among the proposed changes: giving Netanyahu's governing coalition control over the appointment of judges and authority to overturn Supreme Court decisions.Following especially heavy protests, Netanyahu this week froze the plan and launched negotiations on a compromise with his political opponents.Harari said Netanyahu, who is in a coalition with ultra-Orthodox and ultranationalist parties affiliated with the West Bank settlement movement, could move toward a dictatorship if the plan is passed, and sounded the alarm for Israel’s Western backers.“If this kind of power falls into the hands of an autocratic regime, which is also a fundamentalist religious regime with expansionist aims and with this belief in Jewish supremacy, it will set the whole Middle East on fire,” Harari said.Harari, 47, is known for such books as “Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind,” a best seller recommended by well-known figures, including former President Barack Obama and Microsoft founder Bill Gates, and “Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow.”",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851743,Stakes high when Man City faces Liverpool in Premier League,"MANCHESTER, England (AP) — It's nothing new for a game between Manchester City and Liverpool to have significant implications on the Premier League title race.On Saturday, however, the meeting between English soccer’s two most dominant teams in recent years takes on a different complexion.For current champion City, anything other than a win at Etihad Stadium would give Premier League leader Arsenal the chance to extend its lead and move ever closer to its first league title in 19 years. Arsenal leads City by eight points heading into the final stretch of the season, having played one game more.For Liverpool, any hopes of challenging at the top disappeared long ago in a troubled campaign, blighted by injuries and inconsistent form. But the team coached by Jurgen Klopp can still have a major say on the title race in its games against City this weekend and Arsenal next month.The priority for the Merseyside club, however, is to secure a top-four finish and, with it, qualification for next season's Champions League. That's why the stakes are so high on Saturday. A win is vital to both sides — even if they are not going head-to-head for the title.The two teams have shared the last five league titles between them, with City winning four to Liverpool's one.While Man City has undoubtedly had the better of the rivalry, in two of those title victories it beat Liverpool by only one point. The most recent of those was last season, which is why Liverpool's decline has come as such a surprise.If Liverpool doesn't qualify for the Champions League, its place outside the title picture could be extended because it would miss out on the revenue that comes with playing in European soccer's top club competition.That could impact Klopp's offseason transfer plans, with at least one top midfielder needed to improve an ageing area of the team.Jude Bellingham, one of the most sought after players in Europe, has been linked with a move to Anfield from German club Borussia Dortmund. But the chances of signing him could be gone if Liverpool cannot offer Champions League soccer.Liverpool is seven points behind fourth-place Tottenham with two games in hand. But it is also five points behind fifth-place Newcastle, having played the same number of games.A team that competed for an unprecedented quadruple of trophies last year is battling to salvage what's left of this season, with Champions League qualification the best it can hope for.It's a different story for City, which can still win the Premier League, Champions League and FA Cup. But time is running out to close the gap on Arsenal.Victory over Liverpool would certainly be a boost — especially with a game in hand on Arsenal and a home match against the leaders to come next month.City is showing signs that it is set for a powerful finish to the season, losing only once in its last 14 games in all competitions. It has won its last six, but is about to embark on a critical period of games.After Liverpool, City faces Bayern Munich over two legs in the Champions League quarterfinals, Sheffield United in the FA Cup semifinals and Arsenal in the league — all before the end of April.In among that sequence are games against Southampton and Leicester in the league.___James Robson is at https://twitter.com/jamesalanrobson___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851744,A college in upheaval: War on 'woke' sparks fear in Florida,"SARASOTA, Fla. (AP) — Professors at the New College of Florida are using personal email because they’re afraid of being subpoenaed.Students are concerned, too. Some fear for their physical safety. Many worry their teachers will be fired en masse and their courses and books will be policed. It’s increasingly hard to focus on their studies.For years, students have come to this public liberal arts college on the western coast of Florida because they were self-described free thinkers. Now they find themselves caught in the crosshairs of America’s culture war.Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis has targeted the tiny school on the shores of Sarasota Bay as a staging ground for his war on “woke.” The governor and his allies say New College, a progressive school with a prominent LGBTQ+ community, is indoctrinating students with leftist ideology and should be revamped into a more conservative institution.Students and faculty say America should take note because the transformation at New College could become a blueprint with national implications as DeSantis gears up for a likely presidential bid.“I’m sorry, but this isn’t an indoctrination facility. This isn’t a factory that pumps out, you know, non-binary communists,” says Viv Cargille, 20, a marine biology major from Miami.In January, DeSantis and his allies overhauled the 13-member Board of Trustees and installed a majority of conservative figures. The new trustees promptly fired the college president and replaced her with a Republican politician. Next, they dismantled the office of diversity and equity.Changes so far have come in tandem with a new bill DeSantis unveiled Jan. 31 aimed at overhauling higher education in Florida. The bill would ban gender studies majors and minors, eliminate diversity programs and any hiring based on diversity, weaken tenure protections and put all hiring decisions in the hands of each university’s board of trustees.The effect at New College has been chilling and disruptive. Students and faculty compare the upheaval to a “hostile takeover."" It feels even more jarring because the school is for many students a haven of open-mindedness and acceptance in a place of idyllic beauty, with palm-tree-lined paths along a stretch of white-sand coast.“It felt very much like New College was a little bubble in Florida,” said Willem Aspinall, 19, an environmental studies major who grew up in a Chicago suburb. “Now it feels like that has kind of been burst. The campus feels a lot less safe now.”One of the new trustees is Christopher Rufo, a fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute and architect of the right-wing outrage against critical race theory, a legal term that has come to represent teaching about the effects of slavery. Rufo actively posts on social media about his vision for the future of New College, often in militaristic terms. He has referred to new trustees at the public institution as the “landing team,” saying, “We got over the wall,” and talking of an operation to “recapture” the college.New College has its problems. Enrollment was declining until last year. Students complain of mold in dorms, broken elevators and other delayed maintenance. Some students say they would welcome more conservative students. DeSantis and the new trustees cite the challenges as justification for the state intervention.Some students are fleeing, for schools that feel safer. Several professors who asked not to be named are sending out resumes.New College has long been an anomaly in a state filled with large public universities. It has barely 700 students, no fraternities or sororities, and no football team. The average class size is 11 students. There are no letter grades; students get detailed “narrative evaluations” as part of a pass-fail system.The academic freedom is mirrored by a student body that feels free to express itself, say students and faculty, who describe New College as a haven for brainy kids who are high-achieving and intellectually curious. Some were the quiet kids in high school, or were bullied for being queer or different, or struggled socially because of autism or other disabilities. They arrived at New College and felt welcome in a way they never had before.“It is one of the most unique places I think that exists in American higher education,” says Elizabeth C. Leininger, a neuroscientist and associate biology professor, who knows all her students by name. She compares an education at New College to small, private liberal arts schools at a fraction of the cost. In-state tuition at New College is $7,000 and out-of-state is $30,000, but many students get scholarships that cut tuition by at least half.Students and faculty are noticing new restrictions they worry are aimed at curtailing freedom of expression. Faculty received a memo recently with new recommended guidelines for email signatures. They say the signature “should only include” name, title, college address and phone number, which faculty see as a ruling that disallows pronouns. An event known as V.I.P. Weekend that was organized by the diversity and equity office to host prospective students was abruptly canceled. And maintenance crews were recently instructed to wash away chalk drawings and messages that covered a campus overpass. Many of the chalk messages voiced outrage at DeSantis and the new trustees or carried messages of support, such as: “Diversity is our strength.”Faculty are advising students to concentrate on schoolwork and block out the noise, but it’s hard to shake the feeling the worst is yet to come, said Aspinall, the environmental studies major.“I’m concerned they’re going to take a school that does not indoctrinate students and turn it into a school that does.”___The Associated Press education team receives support from the Carnegie Corporation of New York.

(AP) — Tony Skinn, who helped lead 11th-seeded George Mason to the Final Four during March Madness as a player in 2006, was hired Thursday to coach men's basketball at the school.Skinn replaces Kim English, who left George Mason for Providence after Ed Cooley departed Providence for Georgetown.“Tony Skinn is the right man for this moment in Mason’s basketball program,” university President Gregory Washington said in the news release announcing the hiring. “His coaching style will galvanize our student-athletes and his connection to our finest hour on the court is sure to electrify our alumni and fans.""Skinn was a starting guard for the Patriots 17 years ago when they picked up a series of surprising wins — including against UConn in the regional final in Washington, about 20 miles from campus — to make the semifinals at the NCAA Tournament.George Mason's coach at the time, Jim Larrañaga, is now at Miami and has the Hurricanes in this year's Final Four.Skinn was most recently an assistant coach at Maryland.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851746,Indiana's Teri Moren wins AP Coach of the Year,"DALLAS (AP) — Teri Moren has led Indiana to some unprecedented heights this season.The team won its first Big Ten regular season championship in 40 years, rose to No. 2 in The Associated Press women's basketball poll and earned the school's first No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament.Moren was honored Thursday as the AP women’s basketball Coach of the Year, the first time she has won the award. She received 12 votes from the 28-member national media panel that votes on the AP Top 25 each week. South Carolina's Dawn Staley was second with eight votes. Utah's Lynne Roberts received five and Virginia Tech's Kenny Brooks three.Voting was done before the NCAA Tournament.“I think a lot of people were like this is going to be a year where Indiana is reloading, rebuilding, they won't be as good as they had been the year prior. We were picked third in the Big Ten,"" Moren said.Moren was surprised by her team, who told her she won in an elaborate ruse.“Anytime you can share it with people that made it happen. the staff, the players, the most important people who have been instrumental in the season and this award is special. I was speechless.”Moren accepted the award at the Final Four, sharing the stage with AP Player of the Year Caitlin Clark to complete a Big Ten sweep.The team has come a long way from when Moren was a young girl growing up in southern Indiana. She was a diehard fan of the Indiana basketball team. The men’s one that is.She would attend men’s games with her family when she was a kid and was a big fan of coach Bob Knight. She has a constant reminder of the Hall of Fame coach in her office as a picture of his infamous chair-throwing incident hangs by the door. Moren said it’s the last thing she sees before heading to practice.As far as the women’s team, they just weren’t very good. Times have changed, as Moren has built the program into a blue-collar team that focuses on defense and is a consistent Top 25 team the last few seasons, appearing in the poll for 75 consecutive weeks starting with the preseason one in 2019-2020. That's the fourth-longest active streak.Before that, the Hoosiers had been ranked for a total of six times.""People still talk to me about living in Bloomington and they couldn’t afford a ticket to the men’s game. Not that they settled, but became women’s basketball fans. At that moment, you could walk in and find any seat you wanted and watch women’s basketball,” Moren said.“There were 300-400 people in the stands, now to what it is today, it's an unbelievable thing to watch it grow. Things you dream about to see fans and bodies up in the rafters.”The Hoosiers had six of the school's top 10 most attended games this season, including crowds of over 13,000 fans for the first round of the NCAA Tournament and 14,000 for the second round game — a shocking loss to Miami.“It stings right now, but that last game doesn’t define our season,” Moren said.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851747,911 calls reveal terror at Nashville school during attack,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Authorities released 911 recordings on Thursday that capture the terror inside a Nashville elementary school during a mass shooting this week, as callers pleaded for help in hushed voices while sirens, crying and gunfire could be heard in the background.Police released recordings of about two-dozen emergency calls made during Monday's attack at The Covenant School, in which three children and three adults were killed. They include the voices of teachers and school officials, some whispering while hiding in classrooms, closets, bathrooms and offices, as alarms rang loudly. One teacher tells an operator she is with 17 children in a classroom and hearing “so many shots.”In another call, 76-year-old retired church member Tom Pulliam tells the dispatcher he is with a group, including several children, walking away from the Christian school. Although Pulliam remains calm, the tension and confusion of the situation are clear, with several adults speaking over each other and children’s voices in the background.When the dispatcher requests a description of the shooter, Pulliam asks a second man to get on the line.“All I saw was a man holding an assault rifle shooting through the door. It was — he’s currently in the second grade hallway, upstairs” the man says, noting that the assailant was dressed in camouflage.Asked about how many shots were fired, a woman responds, “I heard about 10, and I left the building.”Pulliam, who was driving with his wife near the church when the attack happened, told The Associated Press on Thursday that he is struggling to make sense of it. He said he mostly recalls the children and how calm they seemed, not “yelling and screaming or anything.”“Up there for a normal day of school, these young children,"" he said. ""Now, there’s difficult days to go through.”In another call that started just before 10:13 a.m., a woman tells a dispatcher that she can hear a pause in the gunshots from her hiding spot in an art room closet.Asked if it is a safe spot, the woman answers, “I think so,” as children can be heard in the background.The teacher then says she can hear more gunshots, begging the dispatcher, “Please hurry.”In another call, lead pastor Chad Scruggs, whose daughter was killed in the attack, identifies himself and tells the operator he’s outside the building and heading toward the gunshots.“I’m getting calls from the inside,” he says.One woman, who hid under a desk in a nursery, tells a dispatcher the school, which is attached to the Covenant Presbyterian Church, sometimes has some staff members carry firearms but does not have dedicated security guards.“We do have a school person, or two, I’m not sure, who would be packing — whose job it is for security,” she says. “We don’t have security guards, but we have a staff.”A spokesman for the police department did not immediately respond to a message asking who from the school might have been armed for security. A school spokesperson said the school didn't immediately have comment on the question.Authorities say the attack ended when police shot and killed the assailant, a former student they identified as 28-year-old Audrey Hale.The release of the recordings came as protesters gathered at the Tennessee Capitol to demand the Republican-led Legislature tighten gun controls.Chants of “Save our children!” echoed in the hallways between the Senate and House chambers, with protesters setting up inside and outside the building. Some silently filled the Senate chamber's gallery, including children who held signs reading “I'm nine” — a reference to the age of the kids who died. Most protesters were removed from the gallery after some began yelling down at the lawmakers, “Children are dead!”The three students who were killed were Evelyn Dieckhaus, Hallie Scruggs and William Kinney. The three adults were Katherine Koonce, 60, the head of the school, substitute teacher Cynthia Peak, 61, and Mike Hill, a 61-year-old custodian. Funeral plans for the six victims were announced, with the first service scheduled on Friday, for Evelyn. Evelyn’s obituary urged mourners to wear joyful colors as a tribute to her “light and love of color.”The protests followed a Wednesday night candlelight vigil in Nashville where Republican lawmakers stood alongside first lady Jill Biden, Democratic lawmakers and musicians including Sheryl Crow. The speakers read the victims' names and offered condolences but refrained from political statements.Absent from the vigil was Tennessee's Republican governor, Bill Lee, who has avoided public appearances this week and has not proposed any steps his administration might take in response to the shooting. Lee has been an advocate for less restrictive gun laws along with greater school security.As with similar responses to gun violence, the state’s Republican leaders have avoided calling for tighter gun restrictions and instead have thrown their support behind bolstering school security.In a letter to Lee, Republican Lt. Gov. Randy McNally called for securing windows and glass in school buildings, adding magnetic locks on doors, modernizing camera systems, and increasing armed guards. McNally said later that he also is in favor of red flag laws like one in Florida.Meanwhile, Tennessee’s U.S. senators, Republicans Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty, were pushing for legislation that would create a $900 million grant program to “harden” schools and hire safety officers.Police have said Hale drove up to the school on Monday morning, shot out the glass doors, entered and began firing indiscriminately. Metropolitan Nashville Police Chief John Drake has not said what investigators think the shooter’s motive was, only noting that the assailant didn't target specific victims and had “some resentment for having to go to that school.”Drake said the shooter had drawn a detailed map of the school, including potential entry points, and conducted surveillance before carrying out the attack.Police have said Hale was under a doctor’s care for an undisclosed “emotional disorder.” However, authorities haven't disclosed a link between that care and the shooting. Police also said Hale was not on their radar before the attack.Social media accounts and other sources indicate that the shooter identified as a man and might have recently begun using the first name Aiden. Police have said Hale “was assigned female at birth” but used masculine pronouns on a social media profile. However, police have continued to use female pronouns and the name Audrey to describe Hale.___Sainz reported from Memphis. Associated Press writer Kristin M.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851762,Average long-term mortgage rate at lowest level in six weeks,"The average long-term U.S. mortgage rate inched down this week to its lowest level in six weeks, just as the spring buying season gets underway.Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac reported Thursday that the average on the benchmark 30-year rate fell for the third straight week, to 6.32%, from 6.42% last week. The average rate a year ago was 4.67%.The recent decline in mortgage rates is good news for prospective homebuyers, as many were pushed to the sidelines during the past year as the Federal Reserve cranked up its main borrowing rate nine straight times in a bid to bring down stubborn, four-decade high inflation.Also helping buyers, home prices appear to be leveling off. The national median home price slipped 0.2% from February last year to $363,000, marking the first annual decline in 13 years, according to the National Association of Realtors.One thing that hasn't gotten much better is the supply of homes.“Over the last several weeks, declining rates have brought borrowers back to the market but, as the spring homebuying season gets underway, low inventory remains a key challenge for prospective buyers,” said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist.The average long-term mortgage rate hit 7.08% in the fall — a two-decade high.Rising borrowing costs can add hundreds of dollars a month in costs for homebuyers and put the brakes on the housing market. Before surging 14.5% in February, sales of existing homes had fallen for 12 straight months to the slowest pace in more than a dozen years.In 2022, existing U.S. home sales fell 17.8% from 2021, the weakest year for home sales since 2014 and the biggest annual decline since the housing crisis began in 2008, the National Association of Realtors reported earlier this year.In their latest quarterly economic projections, Fed policymakers forecast that they expect to raise that key rate just once more — from its new level of about 4.9% to 5.1%, the same peak they had projected in December.While the Fed’s rate hikes do impact borrowing rates across the board for businesses and families, rates on 30-year mortgages usually track the moves in the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide to pricing loans. Investor expectations for future inflation, global demand for U.S. Treasurys and what the Federal Reserve does with interest rates can also influence the cost of borrowing for a home.Treasury yields have fluctuated wildly since the collapse of two mid-size U.S. banks two weeks ago. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which helps set rates for mortgages and other important loans, was 3.57% Thursday, but had been above 4% early in March.The rate for a 15-year mortgage, popular with those refinancing their homes, fell this week to 5.56% from 5.68% last week. It was 3.83% one year ago.",2023/03/31,,World

His three-day visit to Germany — his first foreign trip as Britain’s monarch — also included a reception dedicated to building a more sustainable world.During the reception at German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier's Bellevue Palace, he met government ministers, experts and advocacy group representatives. He and Camilla, the queen consort, arrived in Berlin on Wednesday.Brodowin farm was established in 1991 on land that used to be part of an East German agricultural cooperative. The 2,300-hectare (5,683-acre) farm produces vegetables, dairy products, flax and sunflower oil, fresh meat and sausages according to strict organic standards. Almost all of its electricity is generated on-site through a solar energy system.At Brodowin farm, the British king met with young farming trainees and went on a tour of the property, which has 160 dairy cows, 300 dairy goats and 1,800 hens. Von Maltzan and her husband walked Charles through the entire cheese-making process.Due to torrential rain, the king skipped a visit to the cowshed and sought shelter in the farm's dairy, where he filled cheese mixture into a mold and smoothed it out.“We were sort of stuck in the dairy,"" von Maltzan told dpa. ""But that gave us the opportunity to talk to the king a bit, which might not have been so possible otherwise.”The farmers plan to produce a total of about 150 round loaves of the “royal cheese” which will have to ripen for six to eight weeks before they are ready to eat and sell.Von Maltzan said it was an honor “that the king has chosen to come to Brodowin on his first state visit” and also “a statement for organic farming and sustainability.”Charles, 74, who ascended the throne after the death of Queen Elizabeth II in September, is set to be crowned during a May 6 coronation ceremony at London's Westminster Abbey.At Brodowin farm, he got a first taste of the experience when the farm’s pastry chef offered him a piece of a white chocolate cake with sugar icing gems and raspberries on top that was shaped like the crown he will wear on coronation day.The king also talked shop with the employees and asked very informed questions about organic farming, Leonie Schierning, the executive assistant of the farm told dpa.“We talked about cow manure and how good it is for the soil,” she added.",2023/03/31,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851765,Judge’s ruling undercuts US health law’s preventive care,"AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — A federal judge in Texas who previously ruled to dismantle the Affordable Care Act struck down a narrower but key part of the nation's health law Thursday that requires most insurers to cover preventive services that include screenings for cancer, diabetes and mental health.Other no-cost services, including HIV screenings, are also impacted under the ruling by U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor that opponents say will jeopardize preventive care for millions of Americans.Experts cautioned that insurers are unlikely to stop any coverage immediately. The Biden administration was expected to appeal and seek a stay of the ruling.“This is not the potential fatal blow to the ACA like previous court cases, but it would limit a very popular benefit that tens of millions of people use,” said Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation.The decision comes more than four years after O'Connor, a nominee of former President George W. Bush, ruled that the entire health care law also known as “Obamacare"" was unconstitutional. The U.S. Supreme Court overturned that ruling.This time O'Conner blocked only the requirement that most insurers cover a range of preventive care — including screenings for multiple types of cancer — siding with plaintiffs who include a conservative activist in Texas and a Christian dentist who opposed mandatory coverage for contraception and an HIV prevention treatment on religious grounds.The requirements for coverage are driven by recommendations by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, which is made up of volunteers. O'Connor ruled that enforcing the recommendations was “unlawful"" and a violation of the Constitution's Appointment Clause, which lays out how government officials can be appointed.Dr. Michael Barry, chairman of the federal task force, said in a statement following the ruling that people with low incomes have been able to get services they need as care has expanded over the past decade because of the law.“Fundamentally, people across the country deserve the opportunity to receive these important preventive services that have been proven to help them live longer and healthier lives,” Barry said.White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the Department of Justice and the Department of Health and Human Services were reviewing the ruling, but called the case “yet another attack” on the health care law that has been in place for 13 years and survived multiple legal challenges.The Biden administration previously told the court that the outcome of the case “could create extraordinary upheaval in the United States’ public health system.” More than 20 states, mostly controlled by Democrats, had urged O’Connor against a sweeping ruling that would do away with the preventive care coverage requirement entirely.The ruling applies to recommendations made by the task force after March 2010, when the Affordable Care Act was enacted. Some of the nation's largest medical groups came out against the lawsuit, warning that insurers in the future could impose cost-sharing on patients for screenings that are now fully covered.Levitt said if O'Connor's ruling is allowed to stand, insurers are likely to look at changes in coverage beginning in the next calendar year, since existing contracts are already in effect.Although the ruling impacts a broad spectrum of preventive care, it does not wipe out coverage for all preventive screenings. For instance, experts said the decision would not overturn coverage for preventive women's health services that were approved outside the task force.Some cancer screenings approved before 2010 would also not be affected, including screenings for cervical and colorectal cancer, said Alina Salganicoff, senior vice president and director for women's health policy at the Kaiser foundation. But she said screenings for lung and skin cancer, which were more recently approved, could be affected.In September, O'Connor ruled that required coverage of the HIV prevention treatment known as PrEP, which is a pill taken daily to prevent infection, violated the plaintiffs' religious beliefs. That decision also undercut the broader system that determines which preventive drugs are covered in the U.S., ruling that a federal task force that recommends coverage of preventive treatments is unconstitutional.Employers’ religious objections have been a sticking point in past challenges to former President Barack Obama’s health care law, including over contraception.The lawsuit is among the attempts by conservatives to chip away at the Affordable Care Act — or wipe it out entirely — since it was signed into law in 2010. The attorney who filed the suit was an architect of the Texas abortion law that was the nation’s strictest before the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June and allowed states to ban the procedure.___Associated Press reporters Amanda Seitz and Seung Min Kim in Washington contributed to this report.",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851766,Macron unveils plan to save water amid climate change toll,"SAVINES-LE-LAC, France (AP) — President Emmanuel Macron launched a broad plan on Thursday to ensure that France has sovereignty over its water resources, growing increasingly scarce because of climate change, challenging farmers, drying lakes and leaving some households without water running from their faucets.The water problem is urgent, he said, affirming that climate change will deprive France of 30% to 40% of available water by 2050.Macron's trip to a town in the Hautes-Alpes region of southwest France that that has suffered water shortages gave him a chance to change the topic and briefly escape the daily criticism and protests triggered by his decision to revise the pension system and increase the retirement age from 62 to 64. It also was an opportunity to address climate change, a topic that concerns youth. Students and other youth have been increasingly present at protest marches, but have enlarged their demands to address an array of topics like ecology and climate change.The speech notably comes after a weekend of pitched battles in a field in rural France between security forces and militant ecologists that shocked the nation, turning the pastoral countryside into what looked like a war zone. The militants are opposed to a water basin being created to help farmers irrigate their fields.Acknowledging the social unrest, Macron said before his speech that “this doesn’t mean that everything must stop ... So I am carrying on with my job.”He laid out 50 measures to put France on track this summer and beyond, stressing that water is precious and France has thus far failed to strategize effectively to save water. To ensure citizens use it sparingly, he announced gradual price increases for use of water for “comfort.”Major sectors, from nuclear to energy and industry, must be adapted to improve water management.France suffered from a major drought in 2022 and winter drought in February, an alert for the years ahead.In France today, less than 1% of used water is treated for reuse, Macron said.“That’s 10, 15, 20 times less than certain” other countries. He said that 10% of water would be recycled and reused by 2030.Macron's choice of a venue to address his water plan, in Savines-Le-Lac — in the southern Provence-Alpes-Cote d’Azur — is on the edge of Serre-Poncon lake, a man-made water reservoir and one of Western Europe's largest. With rising temperatures, parts of it are currently bone-dry.",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851767,Canada mass shooting inquiry identifies many police failings,"TRURO, Nova Scotia (AP) — A public inquiry has found widespread failures in how Canada’s federal police force responded to the country's worst mass shooting and recommends that the government rethink the Royal Canadian Mounted Police’s central role in the country's policing.In a seven-volume report released Thursday, the Mass Casualty Commission also says the RCMP missed red flags in the years leading up to the Nova Scotia rampage on April 18-19, 2020, which left 22 people slain by a denture maker disguised as an RCMP officer and driving a replica police vehicle.The assailant, Gabriel Wortman, was killed by two Mounties at a gas station in Enfield, Nova Scotia, 13 hours into his rampage. Disguised as a police officer, Wortman shot people in their homes and set fires in a killing spree that included 16 crime scenes in five rural communities across the Canadian province of Nova Scotia.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called it one of the darkest chapters in Canadian history and said he hopes the report is one of the many steps toward ensuring a tragedy like that never happens again. Trudeau attended the report's release in Nova Scotia and said his government will examine it closely. “There is no question that there needs to be changes and there will be,” Trudeau said.Among other things, the commission says the national police force is badly disorganized. Its review of the RCMP’s 5,000 pages of policies and procedures found the force’s own members were unclear on proper responses to critical incidents and communication with the public.The report delves deeply into the causes of the mass shooting. These include the killer’s violence toward his spouse and the failure of police to act on it, and “implicit biases” that seemed to blind officers and community members to the danger a white, male professional posed.In response, the commissioners call for a future RCMP where the current 26-week model of training is scrapped — as it’s no longer sufficient for the complex demands of policing. The academy would be replaced with a three-year, degree-based model of education, as exists in Finland.The document begins with an account of the police errors in the years before the killings, and the events of April 18 and 19.The report’s summary says that soon after the shooting started in Portapique, Nova Scotia, RCMP commanders disregarded witness accounts, and senior Mounties wrongly assumed residents were mistaken when they reported seeing the killer driving a fully marked RCMP cruiser.“Important community sources of information were ignored,” it says.In addition, the report says police failed to promptly send out alerts to the public with a description of the killer until it was too late for some of his victims.Having laid out a litany of shortcomings, the inquiry calls for a fresh external review of the police force. It says the federal minister of public safety should then establish priorities for the RCMP, “retaining the tasks that are suitable to a federal policing agency, and identifying what responsibilities are better reassigned to other agencies.”“This may entail a reconfiguration of policing in Canada and a new approach to federal financial support for provincial and municipal policing services,” the report says.Michael Duheme, the interim RCMP commissioner, said he hasn't had time to go through the recommendations despite the RCMP getting a copy of the report on Wednesday.Duheme said he was “deeply sorry” for the pain and suffering endured by families of the victims. “I can’t even imagine what you have endured,” he said, adding that the RCMP ""must learn and we are committed to do just that.”Dennis Daley, the head of the RCMP in Nova Scotia, said to the families that he knows that the response “wasn't what you needed to be. And for that I am deeply sorry.”The victims in Canada’s worst mass shooting included an RCMP officer, a teacher, health-care workers, retirees, neighbors of the shooter and two correctional officers killed in their home. The rampage started when Wortman attacked his spouse.“Nothing will bring my brother back or any of the other people in this horrible ordeal,” said Scott McLeod, the brother of victim Sean McLeod. “If this report makes a positive change nationwide it will be appreciated, I know, by families.”The report details Wortman ’s history of domestic violence in his relationships with women, including his spouse Lisa Banfield. In particular, the report notes the experience of Brenda Forbes, a neighbor in Portapique who informed the RCMP of Wortman’s violence toward Banfield. He never faced any consequences, but she dealt with years of stalking, harassment and threats from Wortman, prompting her to leave the province.Jessica Zita, lawyer for Banfield, read a statement from her client in which she says she hopes there will be meaningful changes from the recommendations especially those involving domestic violence.Mass shootings are relatively rare in Canada. The country overhauled its gun-control laws after gunman Marc Lepine killed 14 women and himself at Montreal’s Ecole Polytechnique college in 1989. Before the Nova Scotia rampage, that had been the country’s worst,",2023/03/31,,World

Nick Galifianakis, who represented central North Carolina for several years before two unsuccessful Senate bids – the first against archconservative Jesse Helms.Galifianakis died on Monday at age 94, according to obituary information from Hall-Wynne Funeral Service in Durham. Galifianakis, who had Parkinson’s disease for several years, died at a Raleigh retirement community, a family spokesman, Jack Pinnix, told The News & Observer of Raleigh.A Durham native, son of Greek immigrants and Duke University graduate, Galifianakis was an attorney and ex-Marine first elected to the General Assembly in 1960. He was elected to Congress to 1966 and became a rising star in the party while serving three terms.In 1972, Galifianakis defeated U.S. Sen. B. Everett Jordan in the Democratic primary but that November lost to the Republican Helms, then a Raleigh television commentator. It became a watershed year for Republicans in North Carolina as GOP candidates rode the coattails of President Richard Nixon’s landslide victory. Helms served in the Senate for 30 years.The Helms campaign used a commercial blitz to attempt to link Galifianakis with Democratic presidential nominee George McGovern.Galifianakis ran for U.S. Senate again in 1974 but lost to Attorney General Robert Morgan in the Democratic primary. He devoted himself to his Durham law practice in the years ahead.A moderate by national political standards, Galifianakis was on the liberal edge of the political spectrum in North Carolina. He supported the Equal Rights Amendment and was the first member of the state’s congressional delegation to oppose the Vietnam War, The News & Observer reported.While in the state House as a judiciary committee chairman, Galifianakis helped oversee the overhaul of the state's court system into what it largely remains today.Galifianakis had a larger-than-life personality when it came to politics and campaigning. He used his long last name to his advantage, with his campaigns distributing two buttons – one read “GALIFI’’ and the other “ANAKIS.”Galifianakis is survived by his wife, Louise, and two children. Actor Zach Galifianakis and cartoonist Nick Galifianakis are his nephews.The funeral will be at 11 a.m. Saturday at St. Barbara Greek Orthodox Church in Durham.",2023/03/31,,World

They could resume competing from May at the earliest “under strict conditions of neutrality” and can't enter the world championships in late May because they have missed the qualification events, the ITTF said.Table tennis is following a framework presented by the IOC on Tuesday which also recommended excluding any Russians and Belarusians who are contracted to the military, and allowing them to only take part as individuals, not teams. The ITTF said it would create its own guidelines drawing on the IOC recommendations but didn't commit to any specific measures.The ITTF justified its decision by the example of “ping pong diplomacy,” when American table tennis players traveled to China in 1971 to play a series of exhibition games which helped thaw relations between the two countries during the Cold War.“Table tennis has a long history of bringing people together even when political ties have been tenuous,"" the ITTF said. “It can build bridges, leading to better understanding among peoples, and open the door for peacebuilding in ways that exclusion and division cannot.”Table tennis is the first sport to commit to readmitting Russians and Belarusians since the IOC published its guidelines. Two other Olympic sports, judo and fencing, had committed to doing so earlier in 2023 but haven't held any competitions this year with Russian or Belarusian athletes.Tennis and cycling allow individual Russians and Belarusians to compete in tour events but not in national team competitions.___More AP coverage of the Paris Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851770,Lawyer: FTX founder likely challenging new crypto charges,"NEW YORK (AP) — A lawyer for Sam Bankman-Fried signaled Thursday that the onetime cryptocurrency darling is challenging the validity of new charges added to an indictment after he agreed to be brought to the United States in December from the Bahamas rather than fight extradition.Attorney Mark Cohen told a Manhattan federal court judge that his 31-year-old client, a founder of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX, was pleading not guilty to new charges lodged against him in recent weeks in what a prosecutor has labeled as one of the biggest frauds in American history.But Cohen quickly added that although he was pleading not guilty to the new charges, Bankman-Fried was not acknowledging that he can be tried on them. He didn't elaborate and left the courthouse quickly just before his client was ushered to a waiting vehicle.Earlier this week, a rewritten indictment charged Bankman-Fried with a new conspiracy count, alleging that he violated the anti-bribery provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by directing the payment of $40 million in bribes to a Chinese official or officials to free up $1 billion in cryptocurrency that was frozen in early 2021.FTX filed for bankruptcy on Nov. 11, when the global exchange ran out of money after the equivalent of a bank run. He has remained free on a $250 million personal recognizance bond that requires him to stay with his parents in Palo Alto, California. His trial is tentatively set to begin in the fall.Bankman-Fried previously pleaded not guilty to charges alleging that he cheated investors out of billions of dollars before his business collapsed.In late February, a rewritten indictment brought new fraud charges against him and raised the maximum prison time he could face if convicted from 115 years to 155 years.His not guilty plea entered through Cohen on Thursday also applied to those new charges.",2023/03/31,,World

Stephan's contract goes through 2026 and includes club options for 2027 and 2028.The 24-year-old Giménez was one of the league's best all-around players last season, batting .297 with 17 homers and 69 RBIs while winning a Gold Glove. Giménez, who finished sixth in MVP voting, was the key piece for Cleveland when they traded All-Star shortstop Francisco Lindor to the New York Mets in 2021.With Giménez signed along with All-Star third baseman José Ramírez (seven years, $141 million through 2028), the Guardians are guaranteed to go forward with two of the game's top infielders. The team has also discussed an extension with shortstop Amed Rosario.A year ago, the Guardians wrapped up their deal — the largest in club history — for Ramírez on the eve of opening day.Stephan was dominant last season while helping the Guardians run away with the division.The right-hander went 6-5 with three saves and a 2.69 ERA in 66 appearances. A Rule 5 Draft section in 2020, Stephan led the club with 82 strikeouts in relief and gave manager Terry Francona a dependable set-up man for elite closer Emmanuel Clase.Stephan, 27, turned it up in the postseason, striking out 11 of 18 batters faced over 5 2/3 hitless innings.NOTES: Starter Triston McKenzie was officially placed on the 15-day injured list with a shoulder strain. He's been shut down for at least two weeks before he'll be re-evaluated. The team said it's possible he could miss up to two weeks.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851772,Biden calls to revive bank regulations that Trump weakened,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Weeks after the failure of two banks, President Joe Biden called Thursday for independent regulatory agencies to impose tighter rules on the financial system, telling them that they can act under current law without additional steps taken by Congress.The recommended changes outlined by the White House try to put a clear blame on the Trump administration for weakening supervision of regional banks, issuing a fact sheet that said Biden’s predecessor “weakened many important common-sense requirements and supervision.”“The president is urging the banking regulators to consider reforms that will reduce the risk of future banking crises,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters.Rattling the financial markets and U.S. voters alike, the California-based Silicon Valley Bank and New York-based Signature Bank failed over the course of a weekend and required government intervention. Then another financial institution, First Republic Bank, received an emergency $30 billion infusion of funds from 11 large private banks.Biden wants to revive and expand rules for mid-size banks that face less scrutiny than the industry’s behemoths, with administration officials saying that U.S. banks have stabilized since the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank on March 10 as it rolls out its recommended changes.Once banks hold assets of more than $100 billion, the administration is asking them to hold more capital to absorb losses and face enhanced stress testing to ensure they could withstand a possible crisis. They would also need to provide the government with “living wills” to help them be unwound in case of failure.In addition, Biden wants regulators to provide more aggressive supervision of banks and have them ensure that community banks are not responsible for replenishing the federal insurance fund for bank deposits.Greg Baer, CEO of the Bank Policy Institute, criticized the administration's proposals, saying it would impose costs on the economy as the bank failures are still being reviewed.“This has a strong feeling of ready, fire, aim,” said Baer, whose advocacy group represents the financial sector.Rob Nichols, president and CEO of the American Bankers Association, called the move “premature.""The Biden administration's public push is part of a larger effort by the Biden to ensure that individual bank failures can be contained without triggering a chain reaction across the wider financial system.Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a Thursday speech that regulations have been weakened in recent years as the shocks of the 2008 financial crisis wore off, but that the recent failures required swift government intervention in order to preserve public confidence.“The failures of two regional banks this month demonstrate that our business is unfinished,” Yellen said at the National Association for Business Economics conference in Washington. “Regulation imposes costs on firms, just like fire codes do for property owners. But the costs of proper regulation pale in comparison to the tragic costs of financial crises.”What seemed unique in the two recent bank failures was how quickly bank runs started in a digital era, putting at risk accounts that exceeded the $250,000 limit on deposit insurance. The banks' holdings were also hurt by the Federal Reserve raising interest rates in order to tame inflation.Yellen is focused not just on banks, but also rules for money market funds, hedge funds and cryptocurrency.“If there is any place where the vulnerabilities of the system to runs and fire sales have been clear-cut, it is money market funds,” she said. In February, money market funds contained net assets worth $5.3 trillion, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission.She also called for more oversight of digital assets and cryptocurrency, stating that “we must identify and fill gaps in existing authority for the oversight of other crypto-assets."" Yellen pointed to volatility in the market, as well as the collapse of FTX, the large crypto exchange that failed in November, which left investors and customers with billions in losses.Biden has sought tougher penalties on the executives of failed banks, including clawing back compensation and making it easier to bar them from working in the industry.The root causes of the bank failures are still being explored and Yellen cautioned in her remarks that government officials should not prejudge any inquiries that could inform changes in regulations.The Justice Department, the Fed, the SEC and several congressional committees have announced some form of investigation into the bank failures.Lawmakers have held hearings with regulators from the Fed, FDIC and Treasury this week. Both political parties blame Fed officials for not quickly spotting the unique risk that the banks were exposed to by holding onto an unusually large amount of uninsured deposits. The banks simultaneously invested in long-term government bonds and mortgage-backed securities that tumbled in value as interest rates rose.One thing that made Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse unique was the “extraordinary scale and speed” of customers trying to make withdrawals, Michael Barr, the Federal Reserve’s vice chair for supervision, told a congressional committee on Wednesday.Barr has said the Fed’s review of the bank's collapse will consider whether stricter regulations are needed, including whether supervisors have the tools they need. The Fed will also consider whether tougher rules are needed on liquidity — the ability of the bank to access cash — and capital requirements, which govern the level of funds a bank needs to hold.A day before Silicon Valley Bank's failure, customers tried to withdraw $42 billion, triggering a swift bank run that Barr said he had never seen before. “All of us were caught incredibly off-guard by the massive bank run that occurred when it did,” he said.___Boak reported from Baltimore.",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851773,Arrest orders issued for 6 in Mexican detention center fire,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — A Mexican court issued arrest orders Thursday for six people in relation to the fire that killed 39 migrants at a detention facility this week in the border city of Ciudad Juarez, according to the federal prosecutor leading the investigation.Sara Irene Herrerías said they include three officials from the National Immigration Institute, two private security guards contracted by the agency and the detained migrant accused of starting the fire. She said five of the six had already been arrested and would face charges of homicide and causing injuries.At least 39 migrants died after apparently starting a fire inside a holding cell at the facility Monday night. More than two dozen others were injured.Federal Public Safety Secretary Rosa Icela Rodríguez said 27 migrants remained hospitalized, all of them in either serious or critical condition. One other migrant had been discharged, she said. The migrant accused of starting the fire suffered only slight injuries and has already been released from the hospital, presumably into custody.Rodríguez also said the private security firm involved, which she identified as Grupo de Seguridad Privada CAMSA, had a federal contract to provide security at immigration facilities in 23 states. She said it would have its operating permit revoked and face a fine.Forty-eight federal agents would take over security duties at migrant facilities in the state of Chihuahua, where the fire occurred, Rodríguez said.A video from a security camera inside the Ciudad Juarez facility showed guards walking away when the fire started inside the cell holding migrants and not making any attempt to release them. It was not clear whether those guards had keys to the cell doors.On Wednesday, a complaint filed with federal investigators from the federal Attorney General’s Office accused the state's top immigration official of knowing about the fire but ordering that the migrants not be released.The complaint filed by lawyer Jorge Vázquez Campbell said retired Navy Rear Adm. Salvador González Guerrero, the Chihuahua state delegate for the National Immigration Institute, “gave the order by way of a phone call that under no circumstances should the migrants ‘housed’ inside the place where the fire started be released.”The agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the allegations nor to a request to speak with González.Campbell said he would not reveal his clients' identities for their protection, beyond saying they were connected to the case.Mexican authorities announced Wednesday that eight suspects who worked at the facility were under investigation, as well as the migrant accused of starting the fire. Herrerías said then that González was not one of the eight officials called in to give statements about the incident.Herrerías, the prosecutor, said Thursday that their investigation would include the entire chain of command for the immigration facility to determine what actions or omissions could be punishable.Asked directly whether González had been called in to give a statement, Rodríguez said that prosecutors would not say anything which could jeopardize the case, but that the investigation would go where it needed to.Campbell said his clients told him that one of the detained migrants asked a guard for a cigarette and a lighter and then five migrants who had been detained that day began to protest.“The officials made fun of them, they got irritated, and two of them (migrants) set a mattress on fire,” Campbell said.That was the moment, Campbell said, that immigration agents at the facility notified González of the fire and he “told them not to do anything and under no circumstances should they let them leave.”Herrerías said Wednesday that prosecutors had not yet seen any evidence that such a call was made, but the investigation was continuing.Authorities in the region have known that foam mattresses in such facilities are easily set alight and can cause thick clouds of dangerous smoke, ever since a similar fire at a state-run home for troubled youths in Guatemala killed 41 girls in 2017.“That is part of the investigation, the question of why those mattresses caught fire,” Rodríguez said Thursday. “We will look at why these mattresses ignited, when that shouldn't have happened.”Rodríguez refused to answer questions about the cell being locked, the location of the keys and where the lighter came, saying those issues were all part of the investigation.Mexico's immigration detention centers have been plagued for years by accusations of corruption and bad conditions.The circumstances of the fire have angered families across the region who were still awaiting confirmation of whether their loved ones were dead or alive.Late Wednesday, hundreds of migrants walked across the border in Ciudad Juarez in protest and turned themselves over to U.S. authorities.Mexico President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said Thursday that he had told the attorney general to not give anyone special consideration and that impunity would not be permitted.",2023/03/31,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851775,A look at how the largest US counties gained or lost people,"Several large, urban counties across the United States gained residents or stemmed population declines in the year ending last July after losing residents in the previous 12-month period amid the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the U.S. Census Bureau's population estimates released Thursday.Population change is driven by migration, both within the U.S. as people move around inside the country, and from international trends as people arrive from abroad. It also depends on whether births outpace deaths, or vice versa.Here's a look at what drove population change in the 10 largest U.S. counties from July 1, 2021 to July 1, 2022.LOS ANGELES COUNTY, CALIFORNIA — The most populous county in the nation lost more than 90,000 residents last year and now has a population of 9.7 million people. Los Angeles County gained almost 34,000 residents from abroad and another 18,000 people from births outpacing deaths. But it wasn't enough to offset the almost 143,000 residents who left for another county. The loss from Angelenos moving elsewhere was 20% smaller than a year earlier.COOK COUNTY, ILLINOIS — Home to Chicago, the nation's second-largest county lost more than 68,000 residents last year. Residents of the Windy City and neighboring communities moved away to the tune of 94,000 residents. Unlike other major urban counties, Cook County's population loss from people moving away wasn't much smaller than the previous year. It was the fifth-most popular destination for people arriving from other countries. The county had 5.1 million residents last July.HARRIS COUNTY, TEXAS — The county of 4.7 million residents which encompasses Houston had the nation’s second-largest population gain at 45,000 new residents, although 20,000 residents left for elsewhere. The gain was powered by one of the nation's highest levels of migration from abroad and natural increases.MARICOPA COUNTY, ARIZONA — The biggest domestic migration boom was in the county that’s home to Phoenix. Coupled with strong international migration and natural increase, Maricopa County grew by almost 57,000 new residents and now has a population of 4.5 million people.SAN DIEGO COUNTY, CALIFORNIA — Even though San Diego County gained only 1,254 new residents, it was a reversal from the 11,000-person decline a year earlier. The drop in the number of residents leaving, combined with robust international migration as well as births outpacing deaths, brought the county to around 3.2 million residents.ORANGE COUNTY, CALIFORNIA — The coastal county south of Los Angeles that’s home to Anaheim and Disneyland lost almost 10,000 residents, but it was a smaller decline than the previous 12-month period due to a jump in international migration. It had a population of 3.1 million residents.MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, FLORIDA — The county gained only 3,416 new residents last year, but it was an about-face from the nearly 30,000-person drop a year earlier. Miami-Dade continued to hemorrhage residents but that loss was overcome by the nation's biggest influx of international migration.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851776,Veteran actress' surrogate baby stirs controversy in Spain,"MADRID (AP) — Spain’s ruling Socialist party said Thursday it will study toughening legislation covering surrogate pregnancies following the revelation that a 68-year-old popular Spanish television celebrity used a surrogate mother in Miami to have a baby.Actress and presenter Ana Obregón grabbed the attention of the Spanish media and the country's political parties Wednesday when the socialite magazine ¡Hola! published a front-page photograph of her with a baby in arms, announcing she was the mother of a baby girl born by a surrogate mother.Surrogate pregnancies are banned in Spain, although children from such pregnancies can be registered.The news immediately triggered criticism from the leftist coalition government headed by the Socialists. Equality Minister Irene Montero of the leftist United We Can coalition partner said surrogate pregnancies were “a form of violence against women” while Socialist Treasury Minister María Jesús Montero described the practice as “exploitation of a woman's body.”The topic of surrogate pregnancies hasn't been an issue in Spain for quite some time, but it may turn out to be given this is an election year. Signaling it could be, the main opposition conservative Popular Party surprised many by announcing that it was open to debate legalizing such pregnancies if there's no payment involved.Socialist party parliament spokesman Patxi López said legislation must be tweaked to prevent such cases.“We must turn around what we have at the moment to prevent anybody going or wanting to go abroad to seek ways of hiring a woman to have children and this must not allow them to be able on arriving in Spain register their children in total normalcy like absolutely nothing had happened,” López said.The fact that it concerned Obregón seemed to generate as much controversy as the issue of surrogacy itself.Obregón, a biologist and once best known for her yearly start-of-summer magazine photo shoot in a new bikini, posted a message on her Instagram feed Wednesday saying, “ A light full of love has shone on my darkness. I will never be alone again.”Spanish media highlighted the fact that the former actress, who appeared in an episode of the A-Team television series, had recently lost a son to cancer.",2023/03/31,,World

However the decision might well also be linked to Pakistan's precarious financial situation, with only roughly enough for a typical month's worth of imports left in its foreign exchange reserves.Pakistan's foreign exchange reserves have fallen to below $3 billion (roughly €2.7 billion), forcing the country to further tighten control on imports of raw materials for the industrial sector. As a result, factories were forced to close in recent weeks and people have been laid off.Paksitan's general elections are due this August, thoughformer Prime Minister Imran Khan has been rallying for early electionsto pull the country out of multiple crises.Islamabad has engaged the World Bank's International Finance Corporation (IFC) as an advisor for the outsourcing process.It has been in talks with Qatar for a partnership to jointly run terminals at Islamabad, Karachi and Lahore.Though details of the partnership or any agreement is yet to be made official, Islamabad has been negotiating the deal with Doha for several months.Pakistan, with a population of 231 million, is facing an acute balance-of-payments crisis, running down its foreign exchange reserves.Islamabad is seeking a crucial installment of $1.1 billion (€1 billion) from the International Monetary Fund — part of its $6 billion bailout package — to avoid default. But the assistance package has been put on hold since December 2022.Faced with the shortage of US dollars, pressure has been growing on Shahbaz Sharif's government to secure the emergency package from the International Monetary Fund.The instability in the country stems from a combination of things, including rising food and fuel costs, political upheaval, the deadly floods last year, the war in Ukraine, as well as more frequent militant attacks, including from the Pakistani Taliban, which abandoned a ceasefire with the government last November.rm/msh (Reuters, AP)",2023/03/30,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851782,Bundesliga: Cologne to appeal 'absurd' transfer ban,"Bundesliga side FC Cologne have been banned from buying or selling players in the next two transfer windows for allegedly tapping up a Slovenian youth player, but intend to appeal the sentence.The punishment revolves around the January 2022 signing of then 16-year-old Jaka Cuber Potocnik from Slovenian top-flight club Olimpija Ljubljana, who have accused Cologne of inciting the forward to terminate his contract before immediately signing for the German side for free, and thus costing them a transfer fee.FIFA have ruled in the Slovenian club's favor, not only hitting ""FC"" with a transfer ban, but also banning Potocnik for four months and ordering him to pay Olimpija €51,750 ($56,462) in compensation, with Cologne liable to assist him.Potocnik, now 17, has this season scored 13 goals in 13 appearances for Cologne's under-19s, who are in the semifinals of both the league championship and the German Youth Cup.While his ban would be damaging for his age group, Cologne's two-period transfer ban could have potentally disastrous consequences for the Billy Goats, who would be forced to extend the contracts of players they had been planning to release or promote youth products from their academy – all from an unfavorable negotiating position.The already agreed transfer of left-back Leart Paqarada from second-division FC St. Pauli this summer would fall through, while the club would also be unable to make central defender Jeff Chabot's loan move from Sampdoria permanent.Cologne are currently 13th in the Bundesliga, and a potential relegation, this season or next, could feasibly even pose an existential threat to the club.Consequently, Cologne have said they intend to appeal the FIFA ruling at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), with chief executive Christian Keller calling the sentence ""draconian,"" ""completely absurd"" and describing the whole situation as a ""farce.""""FIFA have delivered, in our opinion, a completely absurd sentence devoid of any justification,"" the 46-year-old told German media on Thursday morning, insisting that Cologne have proof that Olimpija Ljubljana hadn't honored clauses in Potocnik's contract, that the player was therefore justified in terminating it, and that Cologne had not acted illegally.Keller claimed that a meeting had taken place with Olimpija officials in August 2022 at which a settlement in the region of €250,000 had been offered. Despite apparently expressing written thanks for the discussions which they said took place in a ""great atmosphere,"" the Slovenians rejected the offer, which they considered beneath their valuation but which has since proven to be five times higher than what FIFA have now ordered Cologne to pay.""What Olimpija were demanding was completely detached from reality,"" said Keller.Amid strong criticism of both Olimpija and FIFA, Keller said his immediate hope was that the punishment be at the very least suspended until the result of the CAS appeal, allowing Cologne to enter the transfer market this summer.Olimpija vice-president Christian Dollinger claimed to the local Kölner Stadt-Anzeiger newspaper: ""I presume that FIFA have justified their sentence in such a way that it will retain its validity in the next instance, and that Cologne's CAS appeal will therefore be unsuccessful.""Any transfer ban would not apply to Cologne's women's team.mf/mb (dpa/SID)",2023/03/30,,

And it won't prevent incidents like the one in January at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, when an American Airlines crew took two wrong turns and crossed a runway in front of a departing Delta Air Lines jet.But Buttigieg and the Federal Aviation Administration are eager to show the public they are responding to increasing concern about air safety.The FAA's acting administrator, Billy Nolen, held a “safety summit” of airline-industry groups two weeks ago and called for more data about the recent close calls. Nolen followed that with an alert to pilots and everyone else in aviation — in effect, telling them to pay more attention to safety procedures.At DFW Airport, the FAA has promised to provide $180 million for a recently completed taxiway on the north side of the terminals and the new one on the south side. Officials say they will reduce the amount of time passengers must spend in planes taxiing between gates and runways.DFW is one of four airports Buttigieg is touring this week to tout infrastructure projects supported by the Biden administration. The others are Charlotte, North Carolina, where a similar end-around taxiway is being built; Little Rock, Arkansas; and Oklahoma City.",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851798,"Gun injuries in US surged during pandemic, CDC study shows","NEW YORK (AP) — For every American killed by gunfire, an estimated two or more more survive, often with terrible injuries — a fact that public health experts say is crucial to understanding the full impact of guns on society.A new government study highlights just how violent America's recent past has been by showing a surge in gunfire injuries during the COVID-19 pandemic, when the number of people fatally shooting each other — and themselves -- also increased.The number of people injured by gunfire was nearly 40% higher in 2020 and 2021, compared with 2019, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a study published Thursday. In 2022, gun injuries tapered off, but were still 20% higher than before the pandemic.Gun injuries rose similarly for men and women over the past three years, while the largest proportional increase occurred among children younger than 15, a subset that remains a small fraction of the overall problem.Experts say the CDC gun injury study, which uses data from hospital emergency departments, helps provide a more comprehensive picture of gun violence in America than simply measuring homicides and suicides.“Hospitals are a great place to keep the pulse on who is being shot, and when and where,” said Catherine Barber, a senior injury researcher at Harvard University’s school of public health.The CDC study results came from more than 2,200 U.S. hospital emergency departments, which represent the bulk of the nation’s ERs, said Thomas Simon, one of the authors of the new study.The study suggests that the number of gunshot-related ER visits at hospitals in the study rose from around 50,000 in 2019 to more than 72,000 in 2020. Because more than a quarter of U.S. hospital emergency departments were not involved in the study, the actual number is likely significantly higher.Experts believe a variety of factors contributed to the pandemic surge in gun violence, including a rise in guns purchased, more time spent inside homes where guns are present and mental health struggles stemming from social isolation and economic hardships.The CDC study shows a rise in gun injuries around mid-March 2020, after a pandemic emergency was declared and lockdowns and other measures were put into place. A sharper jump occurred a couple of months later, in the second half of May, when protests and civil unrest followed the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd.While the CDC study did not differentiate between injuries caused by assaults or accidents, other research has shown that about 3 out of 4 gunshot wounds are intentional.The CDC says more than 45,000 people died from gun-related injuries in the U.S. in 2020, and more than 47,000 in 2021.The country’s gun violence problem was thrust into the national conversation again this week after a shooter killed 3 children and 3 adults at a Christian school in Tennessee; nobody who was shot survived. The shooter was killed by police.“We are in a week when people are paying attention to this issue again, sadly, after a mass shooting in Nashville” said Nina Vinik, executive director of Project Unloaded, an advocacy group focused on the impact of gun violence on children. “Hopefully this paper will add new data to that conversation.”___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

Verlander will continue throwing at moderate intensity and will undergo more scans in a week.“Not the way I wanted my Mets tenure to start. That’s for sure,"" Verlander said. ""I’ve put in a ton of work to not have things like this happen.”Verlander said he had been dealing with some discomfort in his upper arm and armpit area throughout spring training.“I think looking back it’s something that was kind of lingering but it was spring training and it’s very normal to have to work through some stuff,"" he said. “I didn’t give it much credence.”He said the biggest warning sign was a drop in his velocity by “one or two miles an hour.""Mets general manager Billy Eppler said Verlander reported the injury to the club Wednesday night and underwent an MRI Thursday morning.The club said it would have an update on the three-time Cy Young Award winner after the additional testing.Max Scherzer (1-0) threw six solid innings with six strikeouts in his first opening-day start with the Mets. He said after the game that the news of Verlander's injury caught him off guard.“I didn’t realize he was dealing with something,” Scherzer said. “But seems like it was minor in what it is. Hopefully he can get in front of that, nip it in the bud and get back out there as soon as possible.”Verlander was slated to pitch Saturday against the Marlins and in the Mets' home opener on April 6.Right-hander Tylor Megill is expected to start in Verlander's place Saturday.“The fact that I’ll continue to throw is showing how minor the injury is. But still there’s something there,"" Verlander said. He added that he doesn't anticipate missing much time.""If it’s a different point in the season, late in the year, pitching is definitely on the table. But being the beginning of the season, coming off spring training, it makes too much sense to not push it right now.”Verlander, 40, signed an $86.67 million, two-year deal with the Mets during the offseason and pitched well during spring training.He is coming off one of the best seasons of his career, helping the Astros win the World Series with an 18-4 record and 1.75 ERA. He missed nearly all of the 2020 and 2021 seasons due to Tommy John surgery.New York manager Buck Showalter said he wasn't very concerned with the team's ability to have success without Verlander in the rotation.“It’s kind of one of the things that good clubs are able to do,"" he said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851800,"Horses came to American West by early 1600s, study finds","WASHINGTON (AP) — The horse is symbolic of the American West, but when and how domesticated horses first reached the region has long been a matter of historical debate.A new analysis of horse bones gathered from museums across the Great Plains and northern Rockies has revealed that horses were present in the grasslands by the early 1600s, earlier than many written histories suggest.The timing is significant because it matches up with the oral histories of multiple Indigenous groups that recount their peoples had horses of Spanish descent before Europeans physically arrived in their homelands, perhaps through trading networks.The study, published Thursday in the journal Science, involved more than 80 co-authors — including archaeologists and geneticists, as well as historians and scientists from the Lakota, Comanche and Pawnee nations.Prior genetic research has shown that the ancestors of horses first evolved in North America millions of years ago, before making their way to the central plains of Europe and Asia, where they were domesticated. But those early horse ancestors disappeared from the American archaeological record around 6,000 years ago.In the new study, scientists examined about two dozen sets of horse remains from sites ranging from New Mexico to Idaho to Kansas to establish that horses were ridden and raised by Indigenous groups by the early 1600s.“Almost every aspect of the human-horse relationship is manifest in the skeleton in some way,” said University of Colorado at Boulder archaeologist William Taylor, a study author.The study found that the horses were present in the American West and Southwest several decades before the Pueblo Revolt of 1680 – when allied Indigenous groups pushed Spanish colonizers out of New Mexico.The retreating armies left behind thousands of horses and livestock, and many historical accounts had inaccurately pinpointed this moment as the entrance of the horse into the cultures of Indigenous groups in North America.“Now we can wave goodbye to the Pueblo Revolt as an explanation for the spread of the horse into the American West,” said Oxford University archaeologist Peter Mitchell, who was not involved in the study.But Indigenous groups have long disputed this chronology, as the oral histories of many groups have told of them encountering horses before they met Europeans.Rather than receiving horses directly from retreating Spanish armies, multiple oral histories suggest that Indigenous groups first encountered horses that had run away from Spanish camps, or been traded through tribal networks, said Jimmy Arterberry, a study author and Comanche tribal member and historian in Medicine Park, Oklahoma.“We have always known and said that we came across horses before we came across the Spanish,” he said.Yvette Running Horse Collin, a study author who is an evolutionary geneticist at the Center for Anthropobiology and Genomics of Toulouse in France and a member of the Oglala Lakota Nation, said the findings show that the oral traditions of Indigenous peoples, which have often been neglected by outside historians, have unique value to understanding the past.“Our cultures have been so misrepresented for so long,” she said. “Too often history has been told around us, without us.”The ambitious research collaboration, which was initiated by Lakota scholars, is one step in repairing a longstanding mistrust between Indigenous groups and archaeologists, who in the early and mid- 20th century raided tombs and ceremonial sites for cultural artifacts without consent.The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990 – which established a process for museums and other institutions that receive federal funds to collaborate with tribes in returning stolen sacred objects – was a key early step in establishing some measure of trust and communication, said Carlton Shield Chief Gover, a study author who is a citizen of the Pawnee Nation and an Indiana University archaeologist.“Hopefully seeing new research like this will push more Indigenous people to develop their own archaeological and anthropological expertise,” he said.The study also showed that, over time, the genetics of horses in North America switched from being primarily of Spanish origin to a mixture of British and Spanish, reflecting the ascent of different empires.“It means that the shift from a Spanish to a British dominant colonial power can be seen even in the horse genome itself,” said Ludovic Orlando, a study author who is an evolutionary geneticist at the Center for Anthropobiology and Genomics of Toulouse.___Follow Christina Larson on Twitter at: @larsonchristina___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

The 15-foot-tall (4.5 meter) spoon stood against the side of the building with the handle nestled in an opening of a roof parapet. Their surveillance camera caught two people appearing to manipulate the screws that held the spoon to a base and then taking off on a “small motorbike.”“They were so precise about it like they had done it before,” Raman Kalra said. “They just wiggled their way through and made sure the spoon was not damaged.”The couple reported the theft to Phoenix police.Sgt.

No suspects have been identified.Getting another spoon made, delivered and then installed would cost over $7,000, Raman Kalra said.Dairy Queen is known for doling out plastic red spoons with their soft serve Blizzards.The Kalras, who are Indian immigrants, moved to Phoenix from Minnesota in 2007 and decided to go into business operating a Dairy Queen. They now own 34 franchise locations. This Phoenix one is the only Arizona Dairy Queen with the towering red spoon.With the spoon big enough to hold a small child, it was a popular photo spot.“It looks empty and incomplete without that spoon,” Puja Kalra said. “People liked to take selfies and put it on Instagram.”Meanwhile, they're trying some creative strategies to spread the word about the spoon swipe. Staff at the Phoenix location will start wearing “Where's my spoon?” T-shirts with a red spoon and the DQ logo. They've also had flyers to post at various branches around metro Phoenix. The reward? One Blizzard treat from every flavor of the summer menu.In all seriousness, the couple would love to have the red spoon suddenly be found.“I appeal to the person.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851803,"Not just Trump's VP: Pence touts time as governor, US Rep","CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa (AP) — Mike Pence is best known as Donald Trump’s vice president, someone who, apart from one dramatic rejection of his boss ’s effort to overturn their 2020 election defeat, served as a steadfastly loyal, mostly uncontroversial No. 2 during his four years in the White House.But as Pence approaches a likely 2024 run for president, he’s hoping to project the record of a conservative fighter, opening up to audiences about the parts of his career before he served as Trump’s vice president -- his 12 years as a congressman and four years as Indiana governor.While traveling the country and visiting early nominating states such as Iowa, Pence doesn't hide his time in the former president's White House. But the new emphasis on his earlier years in politics marks an effort to flesh out his profile as he moves closer to taking on Trump himself. He wants to make sure voters know there's a lot more to him.“I'm well known but not known well,” he said in an interview this week.“If we choose to run,” he said, “we’ll have ample opportunity to show who we are.” That was after he met with eastern Iowa Republican activists in Cedar Rapids. He notes “the fact that I fought for conservative principles against leaders of my own party when I was a member of Congress, the fact that we advanced a strong conservative agenda as governor.”During political stops, Pence leads with his role boosting Trump's policy agenda, which remains popular among Republicans, even as he says the country seeks “new leadership.” During stops Wednesday in the Des Moines area and Cedar Rapids, Pence tied his own record as a rising Indiana U.S. House member and later as Indiana governor to today's Republican priorities.He reached back to his six terms as an ambitious House member to note his opposition to Medicare expansion to provide prescription drugs, calling it an unaffordable entitlement though it was supported by President George W. Bush and most Republican members.That fits with Pence's call for overhauling entitlement programs for younger adults. Without that change, Pence said during a stop at the Westside Conservative Club breakfast in suburban Des Moines, “our country could be facing, in 30 years, the largest debt the world has ever known.”Later in Cedar Rapids, he praised Republican Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds for signing an expansive school choice measure, while noting that, as a governor himself, he doubled Indiana's charter school program. Education has taken on new political resonance in recent years, with conservative parents seeking more control over policy, notably related to race teaching and gender.The new tack of building out his political biography underscores what some Iowa Republicans say is a liability for Pence in a party still dominated by the former president.“One thing that might work against him is Trump loyalists probably don’t like the fact that he came to some conflict with the president,” said Arlan Ecklund, a former GOP chair in conservative Crawford County, Iowa, who says he likes Pence. “And on the other hand, some who aren’t Trump loyalists maybe see him as a Trump loyalist.""Barbara Schoeben, who attended a Pence event in Cedar Rapids on Wednesday, didn't know he was among the first in Congress to seek eliminating federal funding for Planned Parenthood, a regular target of abortion rights opponents. Likewise, she was unfamiliar with Indiana's expansion of adoption access, a priority for abortion rights opponents like Pence, during his governorship.“I like him and completely connect with his deep feelings about faith,” said Schoeben, a 64-year-old graphic designer. “I had hoped to hear more from him about his record, and I was glad I did.”Still, Pence finds himself in a difficult position even before he enters the race.He is viewed unfavorably by 26% of Republicans in Iowa, according to a Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll taken in early March. That's a higher unfavorable rating than Trump and former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley, who have already announced their bids, and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is expected to jump into the race.The findings are similar to the party’s feelings nationally about Pence. A Quinnipiac University poll taken last month showed 32% of Republicans nationwide viewed him unfavorably — worse than Trump, DeSantis and Haley.Pence on Wednesday dismissed the poll findings but acknowledged he had work to do providing the full picture of his career to voters.“I think what’s been encouraging to me over the last six months, since my book came out and the opportunity to really be out speaking about our background, our experience, our family and my career long before I was vice president,” he said in the interview, “I’ve come to the conclusion I’m well known, but not known well.”Wednesday's visit was Pence's eighth trip to Iowa since the 2020 election. Republican activists in the state describe him as a respected social conservative who perhaps lacks the magnetism of some of his potential rivals.“People seem to highly respect him and know that he's a good man,"" said Jeanita McNulty, county Republican chair in Scott County, an eastern Iowa mini-metro area along the Mississippi River.Tony Shepherd, who manages a popular steak restaurant near the Des Moines airport, attended the breakfast event in the western suburbs and said Pence comes across “as very sincere.”“He has a very reassuring presence,” said Shepherd, 47, of Ankeny. “I'm just not seeing much charisma.”There are also those who see Pence's Trump years as inseparable, no matter how he presents himself.Ann Trimble Ray, a veteran Republican activist from conservative northwest Iowa, says Pence's years serving under Trump, whom she never supported, disqualify him from her support in the state's leadoff presidential caucuses.“My view of Pence is that it’s guilt by association — a big issue for the never-Trumpers,” said Trimble Ray, a longtime ally of former U.S. Rep. Steve King.Such impressions appear to have little influence on Pence's deliberations.More than a decade ago, he had weighed running for president, but “I just wasn't ready,"" he said in the interview.But now?“I stood next to the job for four years. I purposed to be ready every day for four years,"" Pence said. ""And I know if, by virtue of the will of the American people and God's grace, I ever have that position in the future, I'd be ready to serve.”",2023/04/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851804,College ends partnership with school over the David issue,"HILLSDALE, Mich. (AP) — A Michigan college has ended its partnership with a Florida charter school whose principal was forced to resign after a parent complained sixth graders were exposed to pornography during a lesson on Renaissance art that included Michelangelo’s David sculpture.A Hillsdale College spokesperson said Tallahassee Classical School no longer is affiliated with the small, Christian classical liberal arts college in southern Michigan, MLive.com reported Thursday.“This drama around teaching Michelangelo’s ‘David’ sculpture, one of the most important works of art in existence, has become a distraction from, and a parody of, the actual aims of classical education,” spokesperson Emily Stack Davis wrote in a statement. “Of course, Hillsdale’s K-12 art curriculum includes Michelangelo’s ‘David’ and other works of art that depict the human form.”Tallahassee Classical School was licensed to use Hillsdale's classical education curriculum, but its license was ""revoked and will expire at the end of the school year,” Davis said.Hillsdale provides K-12 curriculum in partnership with dozens of charter schools across the country.The Florida school's principal Hope Carrasquilla resigned last week following an ultimatum from the school board’s chairman.Carrasquilla told the Tallahassee Democrat one parent complained the material was pornographic and two other parents said they wanted to be notified of the lesson before it was given to their children. The instruction also included Michelangelo’s “Creation of Adam” painting and Botticelli’s “Birth of Venus.”Tallahassee Classical School did not immediately respond to phone messages left Thursday seeking comment.After Carrasquilla resigned, the Florence museum housing the David on Sunday invited parents and students from Tallahassee Classical School to visit the statue in person. Florence’s mayor also tweeted an invitation to Carrasquilla so he could personally honor her.The David statue’s nudity has been part of a centuries-old debate about art pushing boundaries and the rules of censorship. In the 1500s, metal fig leaves covered the genitals of statues like the David when the Roman Catholic Church deemed nudity as immodest and obscene.",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851805,FACT FOCUS: No 'incredible rise' in transgender shooters,"Moments after the assailant who killed six people at a Nashville private school was identified as transgender, a baseless narrative emerged: that there has been an incredible rise in transgender or nonbinary mass shooters in recent years.Some pundits and political influencers on social media went further, suggesting that movements for trans rights are radicalizing activists into terrorists.The data tells a different story, according to gender and criminology experts. Mass casualty shootings perpetrated by someone identifying as trans or nonbinary are rare, and in fact, those groups are far more likely to be the victims of violence. Here’s a closer look at the facts.CLAIM: Four recent shootings show there has been an “incredible rise” in transgender or nonbinary mass shooters in the past few years, making the group “by far the largest group committing as a percentage of the population.”Donald Trump Jr. spread the narrative widely on Twitter, claiming the supposed “incredible rise” and later saying there was a clear trend forming. The idea was amplified by hundreds of other social media users. Trump Jr. did not respond to a request for comment.THE FACTS: While specific data on transgender and nonbinary mass shooters can be hard to isolate, available information shows that the overwhelming majority of assailants in mass shootings are cisgender males.In making the claim, social media users are citing four examples over the past five years in which the assailant in a shooting identified as trans or nonbinary: the November killing of five at a gay nightclub in Colorado Springs, Colorado; a 2019 shooting at a Denver-area school by two shooters, one of them a trans man, that left one student dead and eight wounded; a 2018 shooting at a Maryland warehouse that left four dead, including the shooter; and the shooting Monday in Nashville.The number of mass shootings committed by those identifying as trans or nonbinary — and their ratio compared to mass shootings committed by other groups — is hard to quantify. It depends on the database used, how the act is defined and how gender identity is recorded — for example, transgender males may statistically be counted as just men. But experts agree that the most reputable information still shows a clear pattern that cisgender males are the most likely to commit such an act of mass violence.Using the Gun Violence Archive, and a definition for mass shooting meaning “at least four gun injuries,” there have been 3,561 mass shootings since the beginning of 2016.Laura Dugan, a professor of human security and sociology at Ohio State University, said the four widely cited examples out of the 3,561 shootings translates to 0.11% being perpetrated by someone who is not cisgender — a very low number relative to the number of mass shootings total.“We cannot statistically make any claim of a trend,"" she said.Dugan also pointed out that there are some doubts about the nonbinary identity asserted by the Colorado Springs shooter.James Alan Fox, a statistician and professor of criminology, law and public policy at Northeastern University, helps maintain the Associated Press-USA TODAY-Northeastern database of mass killings in the U.S., which does not contain full data on perpetrators' gender. The claims on social media this week amount to extreme cherry-picking of data, he said.“There are a lot of mass shootings, hundreds of mass shootings, and to cherry-pick four of them and say here’s a trend, that’s wrong,” Fox said. “You can’t make a conclusion that that’s significant. It is not significant in any statistical sense.”Olivera Jokić, the director of the gender studies program at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, referred to a National Institutes of Justice database that tracked U.S. mass shootings — defined as a shooting that kills four or more people — from 1966 to 2019. The research found that of the 172 people who committed public mass shootings covered in the database, 97.7% were male. The data makes no distinction between transgender and cisgender perpetrators.“The political rhetoric using ‘statistical information’ about gender identification of mass shooters is wrong,"" she said, “and seems to serve to distract from existing discussions about mass shootings as a public health problem.”The claims come amid a flood of legislation nationwide targeting transgender people. Conservative lawmakers are pushing dozens of proposals in statehouses to restrict transgender athletes, gender-affirming care and drag shows. Last week, a pair of laws passed in Iowa that restrict the bathrooms transgender students can use and ban gender-affirming medical care. Other legislative proposals in at least eight states could prevent transgender people from changing their driver’s licenses and birth certificates.Against that backdrop, studies also show trans people are more than four times more likely than cisgender people to be victims of violent crime, according to a report by the Williams Institute, an LGBTQ think tank at the University of California, Los Angeles.“This is capitalizing on tragedy for political purposes,"" Fox said. ""One should not conclude that being trans or nonbinary, they should be more likely to commit a crime like this.” ___This is part of AP’s effort to address widely shared misinformation, including work with outside companies and organizations to add factual context to misleading content that is circulating online.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851806,FBI documents give new view into Las Vegas shooter's mindset,"LAS VEGAS (AP) — The high-stakes gambler who carried out the deadliest mass shooting in modern America, killing 60 and injuring hundreds more in Las Vegas, was apparently angry over how the casinos were treating him despite his high-roller status, according to a fellow gambler.An FBI interview with the gunman's fellow gambler is detailed in hundreds of pages of documents made public this week. The gambler, whose name is redacted in the documents, said he believed the stress could have easily caused gunman Stephen Paddock “to snap.” Paddock, 64, was a video poker player who relied on gambling as his main source of income.The revelation comes years after the FBI in Las Vegas and the local police department concluded their investigations without a definitive motive, although both agencies said Paddock burned through more than $1.5 million, became obsessed with guns, and distanced himself from his girlfriend and family in the months leading up to the massacre.In a statement Thursday, Las Vegas police defended their inconclusive findings and dismissed the importance of the documents released this week in response to an open-records request from the Wall Street Journal.“We were unable to determine a motive for the shooter,” the statement said. “Speculating on a motive causes more harm to the hundreds of people who were victims that night.”Still, the cache of documents offer a new view into the gunman’s mindset through interviews with neighbors, acquaintances and employees of the Las Vegas casinos he frequented.Those interviewed by the FBI described Paddock as a “strange” introvert who never made eye contact and only wanted to talk about gambling, while the gunman’s fellow gambler told the FBI that Paddock was “very upset” that the red-carpet treatment for high rollers seemed to be fading.According to the gambler, casinos had previously treated high rollers like Paddock to free cruises, flights, penthouse suites, rides in “nice cars” and wine country tours. But in the years before the Oct. 1, 2017, mass shooting in Las Vegas, the gambler said casinos had begun banning some high rollers “for playing well and winning large quantities of money.” Paddock himself had been banned from three Reno casinos, according to the documents.Kelly McMahill, a former Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department official who headed the agency’s criminal investigation into the shooting, said there was no strong indication that Paddock’s actions were driven by resentment toward the casino industry.“There’s no way that LVMPD would have hidden any potential motive from our victims and survivors for five years,” McMahill said.The 10-minute massacre unfolded on the final night of the three-day Route 91 Harvest Music Festival across the street from the Mandalay Bay resort, where Paddock was staying on the 32nd floor.Authorities have said Paddock unleashed a barrage of bullets into the crowd of 22,000 people from his corner suite with a commanding view of the Strip and the concert grounds.His gambling habits made him a sought-after casino patron. Mandalay Bay employees gave him the $590-per-night suite for free and let him use a private service elevator to take up his multiple suitcases. Hidden inside those suitcases were the guns he’d use for the massacre.A dozen of Paddock's weapons were modified with rapid-fire “bump stocks,” attachments that effectively convert semi-automatic rifles into fully automated weapons. Some had bipod braces and scopes. Authorities said his guns had been legally purchased.But before setting up his perch in the Mandalay Bay, Paddock also researched other large venues. He booked rooms overlooking Chicago's Lollapalooza festival in August 2017 and the Life is Beautiful festival in downtown Las Vegas near the Strip.“What we know from (Paddock’s internet) search history is that he was looking for a large crowd of people, which, of course, he ended up finding,"" said McMahill, the former Las Vegas police official.A spokesperson for the FBI in Las Vegas declined to comment. In the agency's final report released in 2019, it said Paddock had sought notoriety in the attack and maybe wanted to follow in his father’s criminal footsteps. The report also said his physical and mental health was declining as his wealth diminished.Paddock acted alone, killed himself as SWAT officers closed in and left no note about his motive for the rampage.“If we ever discover a motive, whether it’s 10 years from now, 20 years from now, I have faith that LVMPD would contact victims first before making something public,” McMahill said. ""It’s the right thing to do.”",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851807,Nico Hoerner looking forward to long-term future with Cubs,"CHICAGO (AP) — Nico Hoerner thinks the best is yet to come — for him and the Chicago Cubs.Hoerner is looking forward to his future with the Cubs after finalizing a $35 million, three-year contract. The deal begins with the 2024 season, covering his last two years of arbitration eligibility and the first year that he could have become a free agent.“I hope that it's not the last deal with this team,” Hoerner said Thursday in his first public comments since the contract was completed. “This is where I want to be.”Hoerner, who turns 26 in May, was selected by the Cubs in the first round of the 2018 amateur draft out of Stanford. He made his big league debut the following year, batting .282 with three homers and 17 RBIs in 20 games.He is coming off a breakout season, batting .281 with a career-best 10 homers, 55 RBIs and 20 steals in 135 games. He played in a total of 112 games over his first three years in the majors.“Nico is such a great kid. Such great makeup. Works hard every day,” Cubs President of Baseball Operations Jed Hoyer said. “It would be a shame not to be able to sign him. We worked on a million structures and finally came up with that. Glad it worked out, and honestly, I hope it's the first of many.”Hoerner is moving back to second base this year after being the team’s regular shortstop in 2022. The Cubs signed All-Star shortstop Dansby Swanson to a $177 million, seven-year contract in December.The addition of Swanson was part of an offseason spending spree that also included right-hander Jameson Taillon and outfielder Cody Bellinger. The flurry of moves helped persuade Hoerner to sign his new contract.“I think the idea of extending yourself in an organization where you probably didn't see winning on the horizon, that's not very attractive to me,” said Hoerner, who singled, scored and committed a throwing error in a 4-0 victory over Milwaukee on opening day. “So yes, it is a vote of confidence in the direction that the team is going.”While Hoerner's new deal is done, the long-term future for All-Star outfielder Ian Happ remains uncertain. Happ, a first-round pick in 2015, is eligible for free agency after this season.“A lot of the same things I said about Nico are true of Ian,"" Hoyer said. “He's a great person, a great representative of the team and Chicago. ... He's a really good switch hitter, really good left fielder. We would love to have him for a long time. Obviously we weren't able to reach agreement right now, but that doesn't preclude us in any way from reaching an agreement in the future. We'd love to.”___Follow Jay Cohen at https://twitter.com/jcohenap___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851808,"Man charged in 20-plus calls of false threats in US, Canada","SEATTLE (AP) — U.S. authorities on Thursday said they arrested a Washington state man who made more than 20 “swatting” calls around the country and in Canada, prompting real emergency responses to his fake reports of bombs, shootings or other threats.Ashton Connor Garcia, 20, of Bremerton, used voice-over-internet technology to conceal his identity as he placed the calls last year — and he treated them as entertainment, broadcasting them on the social media platform Discord, federal prosecutors said.He faces 10 felony counts filed in U.S. District Court in Tacoma, Washington, that could bring up to a decade in prison. Court records did not immediately indicate if Garcia had an attorney who might speak on his behalf.“Every time Mr. Garcia is alleged to have made one of his false reports to law enforcement, he triggered a potentially deadly event — sending heavily armed police officers to an address where they mistakenly believed they would confront someone who was armed and dangerous,” Seattle U.S. Attorney Nick Brown said in a news release. “Fortunately, no one was hurt, but the unpredictable and terrifying dynamic these calls created for Mr. Garcia’s alleged victims cannot be overstated.""Garcia's arrest came as a spate of threats and false reports of shooters have been pouring into schools and colleges across the country, unnerving officials, parents and students who are already on edge about actual school shootings — including at a private Christian school in Nashville, Tennessee, this week.Computer-generated calls on Wednesday made hoax claims about active shooters in Pennsylvania, and a day earlier, nearly 30 Massachusetts schools received fake threats.Garcia is not accused of having sent SWAT teams to schools. Instead, prosecutors say, in several cases he collected personal information about his victims and threatened to send emergency responses to their homes unless they turned over money, credit card information or sexually explicit images.Law enforcement entered some of the homes with guns drawn and detained people inside, authorities said.In other cases, he called in fake bomb scares for the Fox News station in Cleveland, Ohio, on July 28 and for a flight from Honolulu to Los Angeles on Aug. 23. In another instance, he is accused of threating to bomb an airport in Los Angeles unless he received $200,000 in Bitcoin.The indictment does not indicate how investigators identified Garcia as a suspect.Garcia placed the calls to agencies in California, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, Oho, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Washington and Edmonton, in Alberta, Canada, the indictment said.Authorities have warned that such hoaxes can prove deadly. In 2017, a police officer in Wichita, Kansas, shot and killed a man while responding to a hoax emergency call.

RNS and AP partner on some religion news content. RNS is solely responsible for this story.___Lentz, 44, once labeled a “hypepriest” by GQ Magazine for his fashionable attire and ministry to NBA players and celebrities such as Justin Bieber, has been mostly silent since his firing, even as rumors and ongoing accusations have dogged him and his former church.(That silence will end May 19, with the release of an FX docuseries covering the Hillsong scandals and, it was announced Tuesday, featuring the first interviews from Carl Lentz and his wife, Laura, since his firing.)“After two years of Carl being in his own discovery and healing process, he has shown readiness to use his God-given gifts towards the local church again. We believe in Carl, his marriage, his skill set, and his restoration,” McQuarters said.McQuarters said the church’s vision to “re-present God to the lost and found for transformation in Christ” includes restoration. The two go “hand-in-hand,” she said, pointing to Scripture from the Book of Galatians that includes a message to “restore one another” after sin, mistakes and repentance.“We are called to be a safe environment for people to evolve and transform,” she added.Transformation Church, founded in 1999 in the historically Black Greenwood District of Tulsa, home to the city’s 1921 race massacre, now meets in the nearby suburb of Bixby, at the 4,500-seat SpiritBank Event Center, which the church owns. The arena, purchased by Transformation in 2019 for $10.5 million, was among the nearly $67 million in real estate properties the church has bought in the area in the past four years.Todd and Transformation Church have become known in Tulsa for their community donations, including $200,000 to each of the three living survivors of the race massacre, part of a $1 million donation given by the church to commemorate the tragedy at its centennial.Lentz, a native of North Carolina, was trained at Hillsong College in Sydney, Australia, before being sent to by the Pentecostal powerhouse to plant a Hillsong outpost in Manhattan in 2010. Dubbed Hillsong NYC, the church drew as many as 10,000 mostly young New Yorkers to its services at its height. But since Lentz’s firing in November 2020, the NYC branch and Hillsong Global have been embroiled in parallel scandals, with revelations of indiscretions with women resulting in the resignation of Hillsong’s founding pastor Brian Houston last year, as well as ongoing allegations of financial misconduct by the church.Soon after Lentz’s ouster, Ranin Karim, a Brooklyn jewelry designer, discussed her relationship with Lentz on “Good Morning America.” A few months later, Lentz’s former nanny, Leona Kimes, came forward with allegations that Lentz had subjected her to “bullying, abuse of power and sexual abuse,” which a legal representative for Lentz denied at the time. A leaked report, commissioned by Hillsong Global to look into the leadership of Hillsong East Coast, painted a picture of a church leadership rife with abuse, sexual misconduct and secrecy.At Transformation Church, McQuarters said they are praying for Lentz and his family to experience restoration and to, in turn, help others do the same, “by using their triumphs and failures to create resources for the body of Christ at large.”“We believe that this is part of what it looks like for the church to be the church,” McQuarters said.",2023/03/31,,World

(AP) — The Kansas City Royals made seven-time All-Star catcher Salvador Perez the fourth captain in franchise history before their opener against the Minnesota Twins on Thursday, rewarding one of the club's most popular players with the rare title.Unlike football or basketball, the captain title is bestowed upon players that have either achieved a tremendous amount or displayed exemplary leadership over a lengthy period of time.Perez fits both of those categories.Along with his near-annual trips to the All-Star game, the affable catcher has won four Silver Slugger awards, five Gold Glove awards and was the MVP of the 2015 World Series, when the Royals beat the Mets for their second championship.He is also among the most popular players in the Royals clubhouse. Perez's gregarious nature immediately puts young players at ease, which is a good thing for a club in the midst of a major youth movement, and he's always willing to sign autographs and take photographs for fans that show up long before the first pitch.""Salvy is a Royals icon, a Kansas City icon and a baseball icon,” Royals general manager J.J. Picollo said. “This honor reflects not just his place in Royals history but just as importantly the work he puts in and the leadership he provides our organization.”Hall of Fame third baseman George Brett and longtime star Frank White were the first Royals captains. They both held the title from 1989-90, when White retired, and Brett carried it on until his own retirement after the 1993 season.Mike Sweeney was the last Royals captain, holding the honor from 2003 until leaving for Oakland for the 2008 season.Aaron Judge of the Yankees was the only other MLB player with a captain title heading into this season.The 32-year-old Perez was batting third and behind the plate for the Royals' opener against the Twins. He's coming off a season in which he hit .254 with 23 homers and 76 RBIs while playing just 114 games.Perez was the club's nominee for the Roberto Clemente Award in 2001, and last year, he won the Lou Gehrig Award, which is presented annually to a Major League Baseball player who best exemplifies the character of the late Yankees star.Notes: Royals: OF Drew Waters (oblique strain) and LHP Daniel Lynch (rotator cuff strain) went on the IL before the game against Minnesota.

""We want to regain the feeling of winning games.""Speaking about the 14,367 spectators in the ground, Stroot was equally buoyed by playing in front of a larger crowd, saying: ""Being able to play in the big arena makes it (the Champions League game against PSG) more special than it already is.""But, despite the homefield advantage, Wolfsburg began the match against PSG much like they had the first leg, second to every ball across the entire pitch.PSG's biggest threat came through Diani, who thought she had sprung the offside trap and given the visitors the lead after 11 minutes only for VAR to intervene.Though the French striker eventually chalked up a valid goal, the 27-year-old was forced off at the break in tears with a shoulder injury which changed the complexion of that match.Wolfsburg dominated much of the second 45, as Popp, Lena Lattwein and Sveindis Jonsdottir were all denied by the goalpost while Sarah Bouhaddi pulled off a number important saves too.Germany's no.1 Merle Frohms was relatively untroubled but did pull off an impressive full-length diving stop from midfielder Kheira Hamraoui late on.After the much needed confidence boost, Popp was keen to focus on Wolfsburg's next Champions League opponents, saying: ""We know how Arsenal play and will be well prepared to then hopefully take the final step to the final.""Edited by: Matt Pearson",2023/03/30,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851815,Bucha one year on: Slow progress in war crime probes,"On March 25, 2022, Russian occupying forces shot dead 69-year-old pensioner Valentyna Zen in the yard of her house in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha. Her dead body lay there until the town was liberated by the Ukrainian army a few days later, on March 31.Zen's daughter Tetyana had stayed with her during the first weeks after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine but she was no longer there on March 25. She had been evacuated to Kyiv with her son the day before. Her mother had not wanted to go with them.Some neighbors saw what happened to Valentina Zen and later told her daughter how she had gone to fetch water in Sklozavodska Street, precisely where some Russian soldiers were stationed. These reportedly entered the yard later the same day and simply began shooting.Tetyana told DW that the soldiers had killed at least two people a day in their own yards. ""My mother was on the phone when she saw the Russians and heard shots. She ran off in fear and made it into the house, but a bullet came through the door and hit her, piercing her liver. My mother bled to death.""A year has passed since the murder, but Tetyana has yet to be questioned by investigators. The family doesn't know if there will ever be a court case.Valentina Zen's grandson found her body after the Ukrainian army liberated Bucha. He also buried her himself in the town. Authorities asked him once about this, in April 2022.The situation was similar for Serhiy, whose father Oleksandr Yaremych was also killed by the Russians on March 25, 2022. He had distributed some food to Bucha residents, not far from the Russian checkpoints. He was shot dead when his house was searched, two weeks after eight of his friends had met the same fate on Yablunska Street.Serhiy said that the Russian soldiers found a cellphone on his father and after searching him, they led him into the woods and shot him.He said that he had spoken to his father, who used the same cellphone, not long before.An official investigation was opened after the murder but Serhiy said that he had spent a year trying to find out how the prosecution was coming along. He said that first the body had to be exhumed and evidence collected, then the original investigator was replaced and it was only recently that he had finally been interrogated.""It is going very slowly, but they are making progress,"" he said. ""They tell me what they have done and what their next moves are. It is a tedious process. I don't think the investigation will be wrapped up before the end of the year.""Ukraine's prosecutor general has tallied nearly 11,000 war crimes committed by Russian forces in the Kyiv region alone. Some 700 were registered in Bucha. More than 7,000 criminal cases have already been opened and 118 suspects and 50 individuals have been brought before judges in absentia. Four have been convicted.According to the prosecutor's office of the Kyiv region, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) and local police searched the area last year. They exhumed bodies and collected evidence to support ongoing cases. Volunteers also assisted authorities, allowing them to collect huge amounts of war crimes-related evidence.Prosecutors say that the investigations are time-consuming because it is difficult to identify perpetrators and practically impossible to arrest them. ""The main aim of this phase of the investigation is to assemble a complete evidentiary foundation as well as eyewitness accounts,"" said Oleh Tkalenko, the deputy head of the Kyiv prosecutor's office.""Interrogators are often able to ascertain the identity of one or the other war criminal by questioning Russian prisoners of war,"" he added, saying that these often gave the names of comrades who had bragged about how many civilians they had killed, tortured or abused.He said that despite the fragmentary nature of the evidence and the laborious process of collecting it, prosecutors nevertheless hoped to bring many suspects before judges and have verdicts handed down before the end of this year. ""After that, these individuals will be added to international wanted lists,"" Tkalenko explained. ""Ukraine has signed a number of international treaties for the extradition of such criminals. We hope that some of them will be apprehended abroad and returned to Ukraine to pay for the crimes they have committed while the war is still ongoing. We will find the rest after we win.""Beyond investigations taking place in Ukraine, more than 20 countries have now opened investigations into Russian war crimes, as defined by their own national legislation. Recently, the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague, Netherlands, issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russian Commissioner for Children's Rights Maria Lvova-Belova on suspicion of kidnapping Ukrainian children.This article was originally published in Russian.",2023/03/30,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851816,"Braves lefty Fried strains hamstring in opener, IL likely","WASHINGTON (AP) — Atlanta Braves left-hander Max Fried was cruising along on a windy, 45-degree afternoon, into his fourth inning against the Washington Nationals on opening day, when he felt pain in his left hamstring while running over to cover first base and exited the game.Now no one knows for sure when he'll be able to return to the mound.Braves manager Brian Snitker said after the 7-2 victory at Nationals Park on Thursday that Fried, last year's runner-up in NL Cy Young Award voting, definitely will miss at least one start and probably will end up on the 10-day injured list.“This happens. You don’t want to see it happen. But if it’s going to, I’d rather earlier than later (in the season), that’s for sure,” Snitker said. “We’ll just make sure we get him right.”Fried said he felt something wrong with his leg while he was heading toward the bag on a grounder by Dominic Smith leading off the bottom of the fourth. Fried winced as the play ended.Snitker and a team trainer went out to the mound to check on Fried, who threw one pitch to test his leg before heading toward the visiting dugout.“It just kind of grabbed at me,” Fried said about the muscle, adding that he didn't think the injury was particularly bad.Both Fried and Snitker wondered whether the chilly, windy weather on Thursday in the nation's capital so soon after the Grapefruit League warmth of Florida might have contributed to the issue.Last season, Fried went 14-7 with a 2.48 ERA to finish behind Sandy Alcantara of the Miami Marlins in Cy Young voting.“It’s obviously frustrating. You want to start off on a good foot and get a good rhythm going. But you obviously don't want to push it too early, ’cause there’s still the entire season left,” Fried said. “So trying to find that happy medium of pushing it to get back ... to help this club out, but also not push it too far where you miss more time.”He allowed four hits and one run during his 3 1/3 innings against Washington.It was his third consecutive start on opening day for the Braves, who have won the past five NL East titles.“I felt great. Felt like I had a really good rhythm,” Fried said. “Felt like it could have been a good one.”Snitker thought the same.“Max was so good today. He was so good. Throwing the ball so well. I hate that. It could have been a real nice, long opening day start for him,” the manager said. “So I hate that for him.” ___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851817,"MLB opening day has 14 clock violations, stolen base spike","CHICAGO (AP) — Marcus Stroman is getting used to Major League Baseball's new pitch clock. And it's no small deal for the Chicago Cubs right-hander.“It's tough,"" he said. “It's a big adjustment.”Stroman committed baseball's first regular-season pitch-clock violation Thursday in the third inning of the Cubs' 4-0 victory over Milwaukee on opening day. It was the first of 14 violations in 15 games on a day the average game time shrunk 26 minutes to 2 hours, 45 minutes.Meanwhile, stolen base attempts per game more than doubled from last opening day, an indication that efforts to spur the running game may be working. Runners were 21 of 23 on steal attempts Thursday, compared to 5 of 9 in seven games on the first day of the 2022 season.Five pitch timer violations were by batters, eight by pitchers and one by a catcher as all MLB teams opened on the same day for the first time since 1968.Stroman clocked an unwelcome spot in the record books while facing Christian Yelich. He took a long look at rookie Brice Turang leading off second base with no outs at Wrigley Field, and then just as he turned his attention back to Yelich, plate umpire Ron Kulpa called the violation. Kulpa pointed to his wrist in announcing the call, and the automatic ball made it a 2-2 count against Yelich. Stroman didn’t argue.“You've got to be looking at the clock. You’re trying to worry about the pitch. You’re trying to worry about the guys on base. You’re trying to worry about your grip,” Stroman said. “There’s so many things going on now.“So it definitely adds another layer to the game that’s tough, to be honest with you. It’s definitely not easy to be a pitcher out there and to feel rushed at times.”MLB instituted the pitch clock this season to speed the pace of play. Players have 30 seconds to resume play between batters. Between pitches, pitchers have 15 seconds with nobody on and 20 seconds if there is a baserunner. Batters must be in the box and alert to the pitcher with at least eight seconds on the clock.When a pitcher fails to throw a pitch in time, the penalty is an automatic ball. When a batter isn’t ready in time, it’s an automatic strike.Boston Red Sox star slugger Rafael Devers became the first batter to strike out via violation. Devers was looking down and kicking debris off his cleats in the eighth inning when Lance Barksdale signaled a violation that resulted in strike three.“There’s no excuse,” Boston manager Alex Cora said. “They know the rules.”J.D. Davis of the San Francisco Giants became the first hitter called for a pitch-clock violation in any count during the ninth inning of a game at Yankee Stadium.Meanwhile in Washington, Atlanta Braves reliever Collin McHugh put his arms out wide after being called for a violation by umpire Dan Bellino in the eighth inning against Washington. That put batter Jeimer Candelario ahead 1-0, and McHugh followed with three more balls — a three-pitch walk, essentially.“I didn’t even realize it happened, quite honestly,” Atlanta manager Brian Snitker said. “It’s going to happen.""The opening day rollout was mostly smooth, but a few issues arose in Miami.In the fifth inning, New York Mets ace Max Scherzer stared down the Marlins’ Bryan De La Cruz until the clock hit zero. De La Cruz began shouting “Ball! Ball! Ball!” — as in, call an automatic ball. But plate umpire Larry Vanover thought the hitter was calling for a timeout. Scherzer escaped without the automatic ball and later induced a popup from De La Cruz.The next inning, Vanover angered Mets All-Star Jeff McNeil with a violation he did call. McNeil was waiting for baserunner Pete Alonso to retreat to first after a foul ball when Vanover dinged him for an automatic strike. That prompted an argument with McNeil and Mets manager Buck Showalter, who seemed irritated that the pitch clock began before Alonso returned to first.It worked out anyway for McNeil — he grounded an RBI single a few pitches later.“I love the pace,” Scherzer said. “I don’t like the clock. I’ll double down on that. I think the umpire should have discretion to turn the clock off.”The Baltimore Orioles stole five bases during a 10-9 win over the Boston Red Sox, leading a league-wide surge in swipes on Day 1. The league-wide success rate of 91.3% dwarfed last year's 75% clip — in fact, there was only one day all of last season when the league had 20-plus steals with a success rate better than 90%, when runners were 22 of 24 on July 26.Those baserunning exploits come after MLB limited pitchers to two pickoff attempts per batter — a third attempt must result in an out, otherwise pitchers are charged a balk. The bases were also made bigger, shrinking the distance between bags by 4 1/2 inches.___AP Baseball Writer Ronald Blum in New York and AP Sports Writers Howard Fendrich in Washington, Kyle Hightower in Boston, Alanis Thames in Miami, Tim Booth in Seattle and Beth Harris in Los Angeles contributed to this report.___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/04/01,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851832,Vatican disavows decrees linked to seizure of Native lands,"Responding to Indigenous demands, the Vatican has formally repudiated the “Doctrine of Discovery” -- papal documents from the 15th century that legitimized the colonial-era seizure of Native lands.The repudiation will have great symbolic importance. Its immediate practical impact may be limited, though some some Indigenous activists hope it will heighten pressure on government authorities in Canada and the United States to reconsider property laws that arose from the doctrine.Here’s a look at some of reaction to the Vatican statement and the background underlying it.__WHAT DID THE VATICAN DO?Its statement said the 15th century papal decrees “did not adequately reflect the equal dignity and rights of Indigenous peoples” and have never been considered expressions of the Catholic faith. In effect, it marked a historic recognition of the Vatican’s own complicity in colonial-era abuses committed by European powers.The statement was a response to decades of Indigenous demands for the Vatican to formally rescind the papal bulls that provided the Portuguese and Spanish kingdoms the religious backing to expand their territories in Africa and the Americas for the sake of spreading Christianity.During Pope Francis’ 2022 visit to Canada, where he apologized to Indigenous peoples for the residential school system that forcibly removed Native children from their homes, he was met with demands for a formal repudiation of the papal bulls.REACTION:The Vatican statement was hailed as “wonderful” by Phil Fontaine, a former national chief of the Assembly of First Nations in Canada who was part of a delegation that met with Francis at the Vatican before the trip and then accompanied him throughout. He said it was now up to government authorities in the U.S. and Canada to revise property laws that cite the doctrine.Michelle Schenandoah of the Oneida Nation, also part of the Indigenous delegation that met with Francis, called the statement “another step in the right direction.”“But I do think it has to go further,” she said in a interview from Syracuse, New York, where she is a professor of Indigenous law at Syracuse University’s College of Law.“It’s not just about lands, but it’s about people and culture and taking accountability for genocide that has been committed against Indigenous peoples in the Americas.”Archbishop Donald Bolenof of Regina, Saskatchewan, said the Vatican statement “is not an end point.”“It’s a little step along the way,” he said. “Relationships on a local level are really where we need to make progress.Ananya Chakravarti, associate professor of history at Georgetown University, said the statement would be meaningful to Catholics in South Asia. It was under Francis that Sri Lanka got its first saint, Joseph Vaz, who was born and raised in Goa, a former Portuguese colony, she said.HISTORY:Though the ""Doctrine of Discovery"" was written hundreds of years ago, it has remained an important legal concept in Canada, as noted by the Canadian Museum for Human Rights:“Both French and English colonial powers in what would later be known as Canada used the Doctrine of Discovery to claim Indigenous lands and force their cultural and religious beliefs on Indigenous peoples,” says a museum document. “It denies the validity of longstanding systems of Indigenous governance and sovereignty.”""The racist assumption of superiority and dominance embodied in the Doctrine of Discovery underpins many aspects of Canada’s colonial history,” said the museum, citing as an example the system of boarding schools for Indigenous Canadians that led to widespread abuses.BOARDING SCHOOLS:Catholic as well as Protestant churches collaborated with the U.S. and Canadian governments in operating residential schools where generations of children were severed from their families, cultures, languages and religions and pressured to assimilate into the dominant white, Christian culture with its European heritage and languages.Survivors of the Catholic schools in both countries have described cases of horrific abuse and neglect at the schools, many of which were unsanitary and fire traps, according to recent government fact-finding reports in both countries. Religious orders have also apologized for their roles in it.In Canada, a 2015 Truth and Reconciliation Commission report identified 139 schools, the majority-Catholic-run, where about 150,000 students were sent in the 19th and 20th centuries.At least 84 boarding schools in the U.S. were run by Catholics and their religious orders, according to a report by the National Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition. Protestants had a similar number, while the majority were government-run.The Vatican statement ""is a huge thing for me,” said Basil Brave Heart, who lives on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota and was a boarding student in the 1940s at Holy Rosary Mission, the school known today as Red Cloud Indian School.The Doctrine of Discovery, he said, was used to justify the boarding schools and the taking of Indigenous people’s lands under the belief that white, Christian culture was superior.“To me it was the doctrine that caused an unbelievable amount of mental harm” to boarding school students, he said. “They took our language away; we were not allowed to practice any of our ceremonies.”REPARATIONS:Over recent years, as Catholic leaders became more forthcoming with apologies for historic mistreatment of Indigenous and Black people, there have been numerous demands for the church to make reparations.The Vatican has left decisions on this matter to be made on a decentralized basis, and responses have varied.In Canada -- as part of a lawsuit settlement involving the government, churches and approximately 90,000 boarding school survivors -- the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops has set a target of collecting 30 million Canadian dollars over five years for reparations.The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops has not embraced the term “reparations” in its official policies, and has left decisions on financial settlements to individual institutions, not to the U.S. church as a whole.In 2021, the U.S. branch of the Jesuits pledged to raise $100 million for a reconciliation initiative in partnership with descendants of people once enslaved by the Catholic order. Separately, Georgetown University, which was founded by the Jesuits, pledged an extensive fund-raising campaign to benefit descendants of people enslaved by the order.ARTWORKS:The Vatican’s Anima Mundi Ethnological Museum houses tens of thousands of artifacts and art made by Indigenous peoples from around the world, much of it sent to Rome by Catholic missionaries for a 1925 exhibition in the Vatican gardens.The Vatican says the feathered headdresses, carved walrus tusks, masks and embroidered animal skins were gifts to Pope Pius XI, who wanted to celebrate the Church’s global reach, its missionaries and the lives of the Indigenous peoples they evangelized.But Indigenous groups from Canada, who saw a few items in the collection when they traveled to the Vatican last year to meet with Francis, question how some of the works were actually acquired. Some are insisting that the artworks be returned to Canada.___Associated Press reporters Nicole Winfield, Rob Gillies, Peter Smith and Deepa Bharath contributed.___Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851833,Ex-Boston officer charged with assaulting cop in Jan. 6 riot,"BOSTON (AP) — A former Boston police officer was arrested Thursday on charges that he assaulted a police officer after storming the U.S. Capitol with the mob of President Donald Trump supporters on Jan. 6, 2021.Joseph Robert Fisher is accused of pushing a chair into a Capitol police officer inside the building as the officer was running after another rioter who deployed pepper spray, according to court documents. Moments later, Fisher also “engaged in a physical assault” against the officer, which ended with Fisher on the ground, an FBI agent wrote in the court papers.A current Boston police officer helped investigators identify Fisher in photographs, the agent wrote.The 52-year-old was arrested at his home in Plymouth, Massachusetts and released on conditions after an initial court appearance Thursday. Fisher retired in 2016 after serving more than 20 years in the police force, including as part of the K-9 unit, a department spokesperson said.He's charged with assaulting an officer, obstruction of law enforcement during a civil disorder and other crimes. The Associated Press sent an email to an attorney who represented Fisher for his initial appearance in Boston.Fisher is among several people charged in the riot who were working or previously worked in law enforcement on Jan. 6. The rioter who received the longest sentence so far — 10 years in prison — was a retired New York City police officer who used a metal flagpole to assault an officer.Also on Thursday, authorities arrested a Colorado man who prosecutors say was part of a group of rioters who violently pushed against officers desperately trying to defend the Capitol from the angry mob in a tunnel.Jonathan Grace, of Colorado Springs, faces charges including felony civil disorder. The 49-year-old is also supposed to appear in court on Thursday in Denver. No attorney was immediately listed for him in court records.Surveillance video shows Grace entering a tunnel where officers were lined up as they tried to beat back the mob. Grace can be seen putting his head down and using his body to push in unison with other rioters against the police line, authorities say. As the rioters pushed, one of officers screamed in pain while being crushed between a shield and a door frame in one of the most harrowing scenes from the riot, according to court documents.After officers at one point managed to clear rioters out of the tunnel, Grace watched as other rioters dragged a D.C. police officer out of the tunnel and brutally attacked him, authorities say. He then re-joined the rioters pushing against the police line and retreated only after officers sprayed a chemical irritant at the crowd, according to court documents.They join roughly 1,000 people who have charged with federal crimes in the riot that halted the certification of President Joe Biden’s victory and left dozens of police officers injured. All of the cases are being prosecuted in Washington D.C.’s federal court and authorities continue to make new arrests practically every week.More than 540 defendants have pleaded guilty. Dozens more have been convicted by judges or juries after trials. More than 440 have been sentenced, with over half getting terms of imprisonment ranging from seven days to 10 years.___Associated Press writer Michael Kunzelman contributed to this report.___Follow the AP’s coverage of the Capitol riot at https://apnews.com/hub/capitol-siege.",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851834,AP source: Alabama's Brandon Miller declares for NBA draft,"Alabama All-American forward Brandon Miller is heading to the NBA after displaying versatile talent and athleticism in a lone season of college ball that was blemished by revelations he was present at a fatal shooting in January near campus.ESPN first reported on Miller's decision, and a person with knowledge of the situation confirmed the report to The Associated Press. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because Miller hadn't yet made an official declaration for the draft.The 6-foot-9, 200-pound freshman, who was one of the nation's top high school recruits, is projected as a potential top 5 draft pick.Miller displayed his accurate 3-point shooting and athleticism in the most productive season of any freshman in Alabama history. He led the Tide to their first No. 1 ranking in 20 years and first No. 1 NCAA Tournament seed.Miller averaged 18.8 points and 8.2 rebounds while hitting 38% from 3-point range. But he was scoreless in his first March Madness game, and went 3 of 19 and scored just nine points in a Sweet 16 loss to San Diego State.Miller was described as a cooperating witness after the Jan. 15 shooting and was never charged with a crime.But he and the Tide were dogged by off-court questions for the final two months of the season. Former Alabama player Darius Miles and another man were charged with capital murder in the fatal shooting of 23-year-old Jamea Harris, who was killed in early on Jan. 15.Miller and fellow freshman Jaden Bradley were placed at the scene as well. According to police testimony, Miller brought Miles his gun. Miller’s attorney said the Tide forward was on his way to pick Miles up when Miles texted asking him to bring the weapon, but that Miller never handled the gun and didn’t know any criminal activity was intended.Miller received threats after the news came out, and was accompanied by a university-provided security guard. “It doesn’t bother me,” Miller said of the threats at the NCAA regional in Birmingham, Alabama, “I send it to the right people and they handle it.”Alabama finished the season 31-6 and won the Southeastern Conference regular-season and tournament titles.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851835,Has T. rex lost its bite? Menacing snarl may be wrong,"NEW YORK (AP) — The Tyrannosaurus rex is often shown baring massive, sharp teeth, like the ferocious creature in “Jurassic Park.” But new research suggests that this classic image might be wrong.The teeth on T. rex and other big theropods were likely covered by scaly lips, concludes a study published Thursday in the journal Science. The dinosaur's teeth didn't stick out when its mouth was closed, and even in a wide open bite, you might just see the tips, the scientists found.The research is the latest in a long back-and-forth over how dinosaur mouths really looked.Recent depictions show big teeth jutting out of the dinosaurs’ jaws, even when closed. Some thought the predators’ teeth were just too big to fit in their mouths, said study author Thomas Cullen, a paleontologist at Auburn University in Alabama.When researchers compared skulls from dinosaurs and living reptiles, though, they found this wasn’t the case. Some large monitor lizards actually have bigger teeth than T. rex compared to their skull size, and can still fit them under a set of scaly lips, Cullen said.The scientists also found clues in the pattern of wear and tear on tooth surfaces.For a creature like a crocodile, whose teeth stick out of its mouth, the exposed part gets worn down quickly — “like someone’s taken a sander to the side of the tooth,” said another study author Mark Witton, a paleoartist at England’s University of Portsmouth.But when researchers analyzed a tooth from a Daspletosaurus, a T. rex relative, they found it was in good condition and it didn’t show that uneven damage pattern.With this evidence and other clues from the dinosaurs’ anatomy, the study makes a good case for lipped tyrannosaurs, said University of Maryland paleontologist Thomas Holtz, who was not involved with the study. Still, “we’re not talking kissy lips,” he pointed out — they'd be thin and scaly like those of the Komodo dragon, a large lizard.It’s not the first time our depictions of dinosaurs have been called into question: Other research has shown that T. rex was more hunched over than we used to think, and that fierce velociraptors probably sported feathers. Most of what we know about dinosaurs comes from their bones, but it can be harder to get clear answers about soft tissues like skin, which usually aren't preserved as fossils.Adding lips may make dinosaurs look a little less ferocious, but it also makes them feel more realistic, Witton said.""You don’t really see a monster,” he said. “You see an animal.”___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851836,"Braves lose Max Fried on opening day, beat Nationals 7-2","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Atlanta Braves overcame the early exit of NL Cy Young Award runner-up Max Fried because of a bad leg Thursday with four hits by Travis d'Arnaud and three errors by Washington shortstop CJ Abrams during a 7-2 victory over the Nationals on a sunny, chilly opening day.The temperature was 45 degrees at first pitch, players from both teams lost balls in the bright daylight, and there were a total of five errors.Designated hitter d'Arnaud capped his afternoon with a two-run double in the ninth and Austin Riley walked three times — once with the bases loaded — for Atlanta, which is coming off five NL East titles in a row. Washington finished last in the division each of the past three years.Fried allowed one run before departing with a strained left hamstring after wincing as he he ran to cover first base for the initial out of the fourth inning. Manager Brian Snitker said Fried will miss a start and probably head to the 10-day injured list.“I'm going to make sure that I'm doing everything I can (so) when I do take that mound again, I'm ready to go,” said Fried, who finished second to Miami's Sandy Alcantara in Cy Young voting last year.Lucas Luetge (1-0), one of five Braves relievers, was credited with the win.Washington lefty Patrick Corbin (0-1) picked up right where he left off the past two seasons, lasting just one batter into the fourth inning and departing with a 6.00 ERA after giving up four runs, two earned. No pitcher in the big leagues had more losses in 2022 than his 19 or in 2021 than his 16.The Braves batted around against Corbin in the second to lead 3-0 with the help of a bases-loaded walk. All but two of Atlanta's 12 hits Thursday were singles.There was one automatic ball called for a pitch-clock violation by Braves reliever Collin McHugh in the eighth, leading to what amounted to a three-pitch walk to Jeimer Candelario — the only obvious effect of the various new rules implemented in the majors this season. All of the bullpen use resulted in a game that lasted 3 hours, 7 minutes.“That’s not going to be the last time that happens,” Snitker said about the call on McHugh.E-6, E-6, E-6Abrams, who arrived last season in the trade that sent Juan Soto to the Padres, was charged with one fielding error and two throwing errors.“There’s no excuses,” Abrams said. ""I got to be better.”Manager Dave Martinez called the repeated miscues “kind of disappointing,” but added: ""These are going to be some of the growing pains we have. They’re teaching moments. We’re going to teach them and we’re going to get them to understand.” ARCIA'S DEALThe Braves agreed to terms with starting SS Orlando Arcia on a three-year deal. A person with knowledge of the contract told The Associated Press it’s worth $6.3 million for two years, with a $2 million club option or a $1 million buyout for 2026. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because terms of the deal were not announced.STRASBURG RESTINGNationals RHP Stephen Strasburg was put on the 60-day injured list Thursday as he recovers from an operation for thoracic outlet syndrome. General manager Mike Rizzo said the 2019 World Series MVP is simply resting at this point. “He’s not doing anything, baseball-wise. I met with him yesterday. We had a good discussion. He’s not going to be here today. He felt that he didn't want to distract from the opening day festivities,"" Rizzo said. It is not clear when, or even whether, Strasburg might pitch again in the majors.UP NEXTThe series resumes Saturday with Braves RHP Spencer Strider facing Nationals RHP Josiah Gray.___ AP Baseball Writer Ronald Blum in New York contributed.___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851837,Phillies put Harper (elbow) on 10-day IL to start season,"ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) — Bryce Harper was placed on the 10-day injured list Thursday by the Philadelphia Phillies, who avoided the 60-day list for their star slugger and left open the opportunity that he could return before the end of May.Dave Dombrowski, the Phillies president of baseball operations, said the timeline on Harper's return from reconstructive elbow surgery hasn't really changed. After Tommy John surgery in November, the National League champions said they expected their two-time NL MVP back in the lineup as their designated hitter by the All-Star break in July. If on the 60-day IL, he would have been out until at least May 29.“We just continue to be hopeful. The good thing about it is that everything so far has been positive as far as his rehab is concerned,” Dombrowski said in the dugout before the season opener at Texas. “He feels good. The doctors, when they checked him out, said they feel good about him.""Harper was with the team in Texas for opening day, which came on the same day that first baseman Rhys Hoskins had surgery in nearby Fort Worth with Dr. Steve Singleton to repair a torn left ACL sustained in spring training on March 23. The Phillies said recovery time for Hoskins is seven-to-nine months.Manager Rob Thomson said the surgery went extremely well. Hoskins took part in a team dinner with the Phillies after they arrived in Texas on Tuesday night, and he was at the ballpark on Wednesday.Hoskins, who will miss the season, was put on the 60-day IL on Wednesday to make room on the 40-man roster when the Phillies acquired center fielder Cristian Pache from the Oakland Athletics. Pache is expected to join the team before the second game Saturday.Harper is starting the fifth season of a $330 million, 13-year contract with the Phillies. He hasn’t played right field since last April 16, had a platelet-rich plasma injection on his elbow in May and became a full-time designated hitter to finish the season. He had Tommy John surgery in November after helping lead Philadelphia to its first World Series appearance since 2009.___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851838,North Dakota governor vetoes transgender pronouns bill,"North Dakota's Republican governor vetoed a bill that would generally prohibit public schools teachers and staff from referring to transgender students by pronouns other than those reflecting the sex assigned to them at birth.The state Senate voted 37-9 to override the veto Thursday afternoon, just hours after Gov. Doug Burgum's office announced his decision.The House, which will convene Friday, must still vote on the override, The Bismarck Tribune reported. The House approved the bill 60-32 in February, three votes short of the two-thirds majority needed to override the veto.If the bill became law, public school teachers and employees would be barred from using a transgender student's preferred pronoun unless they have permission from the student's parents as well as a school administrator.The bill would also prohibit government agencies from requiring employees to use a transgender colleague’s preferred pronoun.The proposal comes as Republican lawmakers across the U.S. have drafted hundreds of laws this year to push back on LGBTQ+ freedoms, particularly seeking to regulate aspects of transgender people's lives, including gender-affirming health care, bathroom use, athletics and drag performances.Although the bill also addresses state employees, Burgum’s veto message focused on its potential impact on public schools.“The teaching profession is challenging enough without the heavy hand of state government forcing teachers to take on the role of pronoun police,” Burgum said in a letter to state Senate leaders. “Parents, teachers and administrators using compassion, empathy and common sense can address individual and infrequent situations that may arise.”The First Amendment already protects teachers from speaking contrary to their beliefs, the governor added in his letter. He said existing law also protects the free speech rights of state employees, who cannot be required to use preferred pronouns.Lawmakers who support the vetoed bill have said in debates it would free teachers from worrying about how to address each student and create a better learning environment.Opponents said it targeted already vulnerable transgender students.“For trans youth, especially those who cannot be safe at home, school may be one of the few places to be themselves,” ACLU of North Dakota spokesperson Cody Schuler, said in a statement. “Trans youth thrive when they are affirmed in their gender identity, which includes being called by a name and pronouns that reflect who they are.”Schuler praised Burgum's veto in the statement Thursday, saying such bills are motivated by “ignorance, misinformation and fear.”Republican Senate Majority Leader David Hogue, of Minot, did not immediately return a message seeking comment.In 2021, Burgum vetoed a bill that would have barred transgender girls from playing on girls' teams in public schools.Lawmakers didn't override the veto. But they are considering new legislation this session to replicate and expand that bill, including at the college level. Two bills passed the House with veto-proof majorities. The Senate considered them on Monday.",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851839,"Final Four newbie Virginia Tech meets LSU, decorated Mulkey","DALLAS (AP) — This Final Four is a first for Virginia Tech and coach Kenny Brooks, and he's set to match wits with a counterpart who beat him by 42 points the last time the two met in March Madness.LSU coach Kim Mulkey won three national championships in four trips to the Final Four with Baylor, but she doesn't have the bevy of veterans carrying a No. 1 seed into a national semifinal Friday night.That would be Brooks' bunch.“The No. 1 seed means we belong here,” he said.The seventh-year Hokies coach might not have been thinking that two years ago after a 90-48 loss to Mulkey and the Bears in the second round.But Georgia Amoore is a confident junior now, not the freshman who said she was shaking when Baylor's DiDi Richards gave her a fist bump to try to boost the young Australian's spirits after the rout.And Elizabeth Kitley is a dominant senior, Virginia Tech's all-time leader in points and double-doubles who's preparing for a high-profile showdown with LSU post player Angel Reese.“To play against them taught us a lot,” Amoore said. “They were a mature group. They were a confident group. I think it’s translating now because we’re mature and confident and we’re playing on this stage that they did.”Things are quite different for Mulkey, too. Not long after that game against the Hokies, Mulkey left after 21 seasons at Baylor to lead the flagship school in her home state.The decorated Louisiana Tech point guard immediately ended LSU's three-year tournament drought with a 26-win season before this season's 32-2 run. The Tigers are where the Bears frequently were.“I’m the only one in our locker room that has done this, but I’m not going to shoot, dribble, pass, guard any of them,” Mulkey said. “So it’s not a matter of what I have done.”The Hokies (31-4) are on a 15-game winning streak, matching the longest under Brooks from his first 15 games in 2016-17.Virginia Tech won its first Atlantic Coast Conference tournament title and has trailed for the fewest minutes in the tournament among the Final Four teams — all 9:27 coming in the 84-74 Elite Eight victory over Ohio State.“Because of the name on the front, because it hasn’t had a history like a Tennessee or a UConn had, people are really quick to doubt you,” Brooks said. “Our kids have seen that. I love the way they’ve handled it. They’re not angry like, ‘We’re going to prove you wrong.’ They’re so confident in themselves, ‘OK, we’re going to prove ourselves right.’ We know how good we are.”FRONTCOURT CLASHAliyah Boston and defending champion South Carolina taking on scoring sensation Caitlin Clark and Iowa in the other semifinal will get an overload of attention.But don't sleep on the frontcourt clash in this game between Kitley and Reese.The 6-foot-6 Kitley had one of the highest-scoring games in tournament history in the first round with 42 points against Florida Gulf Coast.The 6-3 Reese was the first player with 25 points and 24 rebounds in a tournament game, doing it in a 66-42 second-round win over Michigan.“It’s never about a matchup,” said Reese, who is averaging 22 points and 17 rebounds in the tournament. “We’re going to take her as any other post player we played all year.”HOWDY, COACHMulkey wore the black cowboy hat handed out to players and coaches for her Final Four news conference.She noted the irony of her first Final Four with LSU being “in a state that was very good to me, not far from an institution that was very good to me.” American Airlines Center in Dallas is about 100 miles from the Baylor campus in Waco.Clearly, Mulkey has been in a Texas state of mind pretty soon after the 54-42 Elite Eight victory over Miami.“They gave us these hats, and I was looking for some cowboy boots,” Mulkey said. “I was going to come in here and sing."" And then she did, a little George Strait — ""All my exes live in Texas.”“Which is true. I only have one, though,” she said, drawing laughter with the reference to ex-husband Randy Robertson.AMOORE AND MORRISLSU point guard Alexis Morris, enjoying her own Texas homecoming, bristled a bit when asked about the matchup with Amoore — MVP of the ACC Tournament, most outstanding player of the Seattle 3 Regional and one of the most prolific 3-point shooters in the country.“She’s a great player. What kind of player am I?” said Morris, who played for Mulkey at Baylor before a reunion two years later at LSU. “It’s going to be a good matchup.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851840,Up next for unbeaten South Carolina is Clark and Iowa,"DALLAS (AP) — In one of the most talked about and highly anticipated matchups in women's Final Four history, Dawn Staley's undefeated South Carolina team will face Iowa and dynamic guard Caitlin Clark.Staley and the Gamecocks are looking to become the 10th team to go through a season unbeaten and the first to repeat as champions since UConn won four in a row from 2013-16.The Gamecocks (36-0) have the best defense in the country, which is anchored by Aliyah Boston, and they will face a stiff test against the high-powered offense led by Clark, named The Associated Press Player of the Year, when they play Friday night.Despite the buzz, Staley said her team is focusing on the task at hand.“The juice is in the winning the national championship,” she said. “Our players don’t really care about anything besides that. So we are — again — we’re strong in our beliefs and what we do and how we’ve done things. And at this point, we just want to win, and that’s their approach. I love them for that. They’re not letting any one thing or any one person distract them from the goal at hand.”Clark also downplayed the talk around the individual matchup of her and Boston, the last two AP Player of the Year winners.“It’s going to be Iowa versus South Carolina, and that’s who’s going to win the game,” Clark said. “It’s not going to be one player who’s going to win the game. I’m lucky enough to have four really good teammates on the court with me at the same time.”Clark has put on quite a show since coming to Iowa (30-6). She led the nation in scoring twice and last weekend had a game for the ages, recording the first 40-point triple-double in NCAA history to lead the Hawkeyes to their first Final Four in 30 years.This national semifinal has everything that women’s basketball could hope for, with the stars on the court and a team trying to secure its place in history — something that’s missing at the men’s Final Four this season.The winner will face either LSU or Virginia Tech in the championship game Sunday night. Ticket prices for the women’s Final Four are going for more than the men’s games four hours away in Houston.Clark was happy to see the attention being paid to the women's games, but she was quick to point out that the women’s games are being played in a basketball arena while the men’s national semifinals are at a football stadium, which are much larger.“I think it shows the demand that people want to be here and be in the arena that seats 20,000 people,” she said. “More than anything, I’m just lucky and we’re just lucky to get to play on a stage in front of so many people that love the game and want to watch our game.”BACK AGAINSouth Carolina has had great history in Dallas, winning its first national championship in 2017 in the same arena it is playing in this weekend. The Gamecocks, who have now been to three straight Final Fours, beat Mississippi State in the title game in 2017 after the Bulldogs had ended UConn's 111-game winning streak in the semifinals.“I love Dallas. Dallas is where we got our first national championship,” Staley said. “I just remember obviously the Dallas police officers, the motorcade. They get us where we need to go. It’s super cool seeing that, and it’s super cool to experience that again. I just remember the shot that beat UConn and then having to play — having an all-SEC national championship game.”SHOOTING FROM AFARClark is known for her pinpoint passing and her deep 3-point shooting. She has made over a dozen 3-pointers from 30 feet or more in her career.“Those are shots I practice, and I shoot them in practice, too,” Clark said. “I think it all just stems from the confidence of the work I’ve put in. Honestly, I would say it’s more so come with being in college more than anything.”RETURN TO THE BIG STAGENo one on Iowa's roster was alive the last time that the Hawkeyes reached the Final Four. C. Vivian Stringer was the coach of that team in 1993 that lost to Ohio State in overtime.Stringer left a voicemail for coach Lisa Bluder after her team advanced this far.“It wasn’t a text, it was a voice message, which tells you the age of both of us,” Bluder said. ""Who leaves voice messages anymore? But I love voice messages because you can hear the enthusiasm in their voice versus reading it on a text, and she definitely had a lot of enthusiasm.“Her love for the Hawks is strong, and I’m thankful — you were talking about mentors, and for the players, Vivian was certainly one of mine. So I’m very thankful to have her support as the last person that took this team to a Final Four. That really means a lot.”___More AP coverage of March Madness: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/womens-college-basketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/04/01,,World

(AP) — Wisconsin has filled its men’s hockey head coaching vacancy by hiring Mike Hastings away from Minnesota State.Athletic director Chris McIntosh announced the hire Thursday. Hastings replaces Tony Granato, who was fired after going 105-129-16 in seven seasons at Wisconsin.Hastings posted a 299-109-25 record at Minnesota State that included consecutive Frozen Four appearances in 2021 and 2022. Minnesota State lost 5-1 to Denver in the 2022 NCAA championship game.“Wisconsin is one of college hockey’s great programs and I am both thrilled and humbled to have this opportunity,” Hastings said in a statement released by the university. “I want to thank Chris McIntosh for his belief in me. Badger hockey has a lot going for it – great alums, fans, facilities, tradition, a terrific campus and city. I can’t wait to get to Madison and start working with our team on building a winning culture on and off the ice.”Hastings’ teams have produced winning records in each of his 25 seasons as a head coach.Hastings was coach and general manager for the United States Hockey League’s Omaha Lancers from 1994-2008 before coming to Minnesota State. He owned a 529-210-56 record with the Lancers.Wisconsin has posted a losing record each of the last two seasons, including a 13-23 mark this year. The Badgers finished below .500 in five of Granato’s seven seasons and last reached the NCAA Tournament in 2021.Hastings has won the Spencer Penrose Award as the NCAA coach of the year on three different occasions.___AP college sports: https://apnews.com/hub/college-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851842,Falcons add more WR depth by signing Scotty Miller,"ATLANTA (AP) — The Atlanta Falcons added depth at receiver on Thursday by signing free agent Scotty Miller to a one-year contract.Miller spent the past four seasons with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who selected him in the sixth round of the 2019 draft out of Bowling Green.He tallied 23 receptions for 185 yards this past season, playing in 15 games with one start while mostly working behind Mike Evans and Chris Godwin.Miller is looking for more playing time with the Falcons, who relied heavily on the run game while enduring their fifth straight losing season.“It's an opportunity to get on the field and play. In Tampa, that was hard to do. The receiver room was loaded with talent,"" the 25-year-old Miller said. “I'm really excited to get on the field and show what I can do.”Drake London, a first-round pick in 2022, is coming off an impressive rookie season with the Falcons. But he didn't have much help at receiver, especially after tight end Kyle Pitts went down with a season-ending knee injury.Atlanta turned to free agency to bulk up the position, also s igning Mack Hollins to a one-year deal after he set career highs with 57 catches for 690 yards, along with four touchdowns, for the Las Vegas Raiders last season.While the Falcons could add another receiver in the draft, Hollins and Miller both figure to get plenty of looks.The 5-foot-9, 174-pound Miller totaled 74 receptions for 924 yards and four touchdowns in 50 games — including eight starts — with the Buccaneers.His best season was on Tampa Bay's Super Bowl-winning team during the 2020 season. Miller caught 33 passes for 501 yards and three TDs in an offense directed by Tom Brady.After playing three seasons with Brady, perhaps the greatest quarterback in NFL history, Miller is looking forward to working with the Falcons' second-year quarterback, Desmond Ridder, who has made only four career starts.Miller got a chance to watch one of those appearances when the Falcons defeated the Bucs in the regular-season finale last season.“Obviously, I was fortunate to be able to play with Tom,” Miller said. “But I'm excited to play with a young guy like Desmond. ... I really like what he brings to the table. A lot of energy, the ability to create, to throw the long ball. He can do all the things you need to do.""The undersized Miller is a striking contrast to London and Hollins, who are both listed at 6 foot 4.But Miller said his speed and quickness help make up for his lack of size. Also, he feels comfortable lining up both in the slot and on the outside.“I'm willing to do whatever it takes,” he said. “I really feel like I'm a well-rounded player.”Also Thursday, the Falcons confirmed the re-signing of offensive tackle Kaleb McGary to a $34.5 million, three-year contract.McGary has played in 63 games, all but one as a starter, since being selected late in the first round of the 2019 draft. He started every game at right tackle last season, joining Jake Matthews and Chris Lindstrom as cornerstones of the line. All three are now signed to multi-year deals.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851843,"Swanson, Stroman help Cubs beat Brewers 4-0 on opening day","CHICAGO (AP) — Right after it was over, Dansby Swanson soaked in one more moment in a very special debut with the Chicago Cubs.He finally got to enjoy the victory song at Wrigley Field.“Hearing ‘Go Cubs Go’ is a lot better when you're on the team,"" the All-Star shortstop said.Swanson had three hits and Marcus Stroman worked six scoreless innings, breezing past baseball's first pitch-clock violation on his way to a 4-0 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers on Thursday on opening day.Swanson's first hit with his new team was an RBI single that sparked a four-run third. He tacked on two more singles and played his usual solid defense, including the turn on a key double play.“Great debut for him,” manager David Ross said.Swanson signed a $177 million, seven-year contract with Chicago in free agency, leaving the Atlanta Braves after seven seasons. The addition of the Georgia native was the marquee move in a busy offseason for the Cubs after finishing third in the NL Central with a 74-88 record.“It was just an amazing day,” Swanson said. “It's an amazing city, organization. Couldn't be more grateful to be here.”Milwaukee was limited to singles for rookie Brice Turang, Willy Adames, Brian Anderson and William Contreras. It also was a tough day for Brewers ace Corbin Burnes, who allowed four hits and issued three walks in five innings.“We put some runners on, but there wasn't many hits for both sides today,” Milwaukee manager Craig Counsell said.Stroman struck out eight and walked three in the first start of his second season with the Cubs. Keegan Thompson and Brad Boxberger each got three outs before Michael Fulmer finished the four-hitter.Milwaukee threatened in the third, loading the bases with one out. But Rowdy Tellez bounced to second baseman Nico Hoerner for the start of a 4-6-3 double play.“Once I saw it being hit at Nico, I had the utmost confidence in me that it was going to be rolled,” Stroman said.The inning featured the majors' first violation of its new pitch clock. With no outs, Turang on second base and Christian Yelich at the plate, plate umpire Ron Kulpa pointed to his left wrist and then pointed at Stroman in announcing the violation.The automatic ball made it a 2-2 count, and Yelich ended up with a walk. But there was never any sign of any protest from Stroman.Major League Baseball introduced the pitch clock this season to speed the pace of play. Players have 30 seconds to resume play between batters. Between pitches, pitchers have 15 seconds with nobody on and 20 seconds if there is a baserunner. Batters must be in the box and alert to the pitcher with at least eight seconds on the clock.“It's definitely not easy to be a pitcher out there and feel rushed at times,” Stroman said.The Cubs went ahead to stay in the bottom half of the third. Swanson singled home Miles Mastrobuoni and scored on Trey Mancini's single. Hoerner scored on a throwing error on shortstop Adames.FIRST IMPRESSIONSTurang became the seventh player in franchise history to make his big league debut in the team's opening-day lineup. The list also includes Hall of Famers Robin Yount (1974) and Paul Molitor (1978).The 23-year-old Turang wore a suit to the ballpark.“I thought that was just awesome,” Counsell said with a grin. “And he said his dad told him to do it.”TRAINER'S ROOMBrewers: 3B Luis Urías appeared to tweak his left hamstring trying to beat out a comebacker in the ninth. “We'll let him calm down just from the adrenaline stuff and then evaluate it,” Counsell said.Cubs: OF Seiya Suzuki (left oblique strain) was placed on the 10-day injured list, and RHP Kyle Hendricks (right shoulder strain) and LHP Brandon Hughes (left knee inflammation) were placed on the 15-day IL. Each IL stint was made retroactive to Monday.UP NEXTFollowing an off day, right-hander Brandon Woodruff and left-hander Justin Steele take the mound on Saturday afternoon.

In the photo, Hamlin is seen holding a Bills jersey in his lap.Hamlin collapsed while playing against the Cincinnati Bengals on Jan. 2 during ESPN’s “Monday Night Football.” Since then, Hamlin has had a remarkable recovery, according to doctors, and the team's general manager said last month that Hamlin's “end game” is to resume playing so long as he receives the necessary medical clearance.The White House said in a statement that Hamlin's efforts during his recovery had helped to “make life-saving technologies more widely available.” Biden had previously spoken by phone with Hamlin’s parents while visiting Cincinnati on Jan. 4, two days after the game and while Hamlin was in the hospital.On Wednesday, Hamlin appeared with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Rep.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851845,Miami's motivational Larrañaga leads another Final Four run,"HOUSTON (AP) — Begin with the end in mind.A devotee of Franklin Covey’s “The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People,” Jim Larrañaga chose Habit 2 to describe Miami's first trip to the Final Four.“You’ve got to have a vision of where you’re going,"" Larrañaga said. “It’s like putting in your GPS, your destination, and I think we put in Houston as our destination. That was going to be our road map.""Larrañaga has been down this road before.With Larrañaga at the helm, George Mason had one of the greatest mid-major runs in NCAA Tournament history, pulling off one upset after another — and a nation of underdog fans with them — all the way to the 2006 Final Four.“He was a teacher, he was a mentor, a wizard,” said Tony Skinn, a guard on the 2006 George Mason team who was named head coach of his alma mater on Thursday. “When you have a chance to play for a guy like that, you get the results we ended up getting. It’s not surprising he’s in this position. It’s a new group, but same Jedi master.”Larrañaga's first Final Four run started with some Selection Sunday sweat.The Patriots shared the Colonial Athletic Association regular season title with UNC Wilmington, but lost to Hofstra in the conference tournament semifinals. An at-large bid was their only hope to get into the NCAA Tournament.“It was like, yeah, we’re going to watch it, but I didn’t think we’d get in,” said Folarin Campbell, a guard on the 2006 team. “We were sitting at Coach L’s house and I can remember everyone just jumping up and down, cheering. It was a great feeling.”The good vibes kept flowing.A No. 11 seed, George Mason pulled off its first upset by knocking off Michigan State, a Final Four team the year before.The Patriots took down North Carolina two days later, creating a campus-wide euphoria back in Fairfax, Virginia. The jubilation exploded the next week after wins over Wichita State and UConn sent the Patriots to the Final Four for the first time.“That school is pretty big, so you don’t always see everybody in the same space,” Skinn said. “When we came back, you would have thought they enrolled an extra 100,000 people while we were gone.”George Mason lost to eventual national champion Florida in the Final Four but the madness-inducing run still endears — just like it will for the Hurricanes.Miami has long been considered a football school. The men's basketball program? It was once disbanded due to lack of interest on campus.Leonard Hamilton brought the program back to life in the late 1990s. Now Larrañaga has carried the Hurricanes into uncharted waters.The 73-year-old has led Miami to the Sweet 16 four times, including its first trip to the Elite Eight a year ago. The Hurricanes took another big first step with an Elite Eight win over Texas last weekend.Students jumped into campus lakes and ponds. More than 100 people were waiting when the Hurricanes landed around 3 a.m. And the team had a huge sendoff before flying to Houston to face UConn in the national semifinals on Saturday.“That was one of the greatest moments of my life,” said Miami forward Anthony Walker, wearing a black Final Four cowboy hat. “The energy has been electric and I guarantee you there will be a lot of Miami fans in that building.”The two deep March runs 17 years apart had similar trajectories. The teams are similar as well.An ACC school, Miami attracts higher-level recruits, yet the Hurricanes are undersized, gritty, play hard no matter the score — just like the Patriots were. Tenacity helped Miami rally from a 16-point deficit to beat Texas, just like the 2006 George Mason team did against North Carolina.Larrañaga is the thread binding the two teams in history.He's a motivator and storyteller who also listens. He's big on motivational quotes and Eastern philosophy, even if his players don't always understand what he's talking about. He takes joy in his players' personal successes and even dances with them after big wins — maybe even a little better now than when he was dealing with hip pain 17 years ago.“He just knows how to motivate guys,” Campbell said.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/31,,World

When people really turn on the TV or sit in the seat, they understand how good the product is and how much fun it is to watch.”An all-session ticket for the women's Final Four was at least $475 on StubHub and $335 on Vivid Seats, before fees, as of 3 p.m. EDT Thursday. Men's all-sessions tickets were going for at least $65 and $66, respectively.The women's semifinals on Friday, which is headlined by the matchup of Clark's Hawkeyes against undefeated, top-ranked and defending champion South Carolina, start at $222 on StubHub and $184 on Vivid Seats. That compares to $45 and $44 for Saturday's semifinals on the men's side.“It’s been building towards this for a long time,"" South Carolina coach Dawn Staley said. “Fortunately for us — not just South Carolina, but us as women’s basketball — we’ve got a lot of star power behind our sport.”Tickets for Sunday's women's championship game begin at $167 on StubHub and $131 on Vivid Seats, and Monday's men's title game is at $45 and $37.The men are playing in Houston's NRG Stadium, home of the NFL's Texans, which seats close to 75,000. The women are at Dallas' American Airlines Center, home of the NBA's Mavericks and NHL's Stars, which has nearly 20,000 seats.“It’s pretty neat that it’s sold out,” LSU coach Kim Mulkey said. “The cheapest ticket is more expensive than the cheapest ticket in Houston for the men’s Final Four.

Five years later, prosecutors say he tried squelch an investigation into the financer and persuade then-President Donald Trump's administration to return to China a “vocal critic of the government.""“This is a case about foreign money, foreign influence and concealment,” said prosecutor Nicole Rae Lockhart. Michel pocketed over $100 million in the saga involving “political intrigue, backroom dealing, ... burner phones and lies,” she said.Michel's lawyers have previously said he is innocent and “extremely disappointed” in the charges, but the defense decided to wait to give its opening statement in the trial that's expected to last weeks.The Department of Justice says Michel conspired with Low Taek Jho, usually known as Jho Low. The fugitive financer is accused of masterminding a money laundering and bribery scheme that pilfered billions from the Malaysian state investment fund known as 1MDB.Looted money paid for jewelry and luxury art and helped finance Hollywood films like “The Wolf of Wall Street.”Low was once known for his business and social ties to American celebrities like Kim Kardashian and Leonardo DiCaprio, a possible witness in the case. During the 2012 presidential campaign, prosecutors allege Low directed more than $20 million to Michel, who concealed its origin by giving the money to straw donors to give to the Obama campaign. He later tried to lean on the donors to keep them from talking to investigators, Lockhart said.In 2017, prosecutors say, the Grammy-winning rapper worked with a Republican “fixer"" to try and shut down a U.S. investigation into Low and embezzlement from the Malaysian fund. He's also accused of pushing the Trump administration to send a Chinese person who had fled to the U.S. back to China.“It almost worked,” Lockhart said. “The defendant wanted money and was willing to break any laws necessary to get paid.”The Justice Department last year announced charges against Low and two former Goldman Sachs bankers in the money laundering and bribery scheme that pilfered money from the fund, which was created to spur economic development projects in Malaysia. Low is a fugitive but has maintained his innocence.One of the bankers, Roger Ng, was sentenced to 10 years in prison this month for his role in the scheme.",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851850,Turkey's parliament ratifies Finland's membership in NATO,"ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Turkey’s parliament on Thursday ratified Finland’s application to join NATO, lifting the last hurdle in the way of the Nordic country’s long-delayed accession into the Western military alliance.All 276 lawmakers present voted in favor of Finland’s bid, days after Hungary’s parliament also endorsed Helsinki’s accession.“This will make the whole NATO family stronger & safer,” NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg wrote on Twitter in welcoming Turkey's action.Alarmed by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine a year ago, Finland and Sweden abandoned their decades-long policy of nonalignment and applied to join the alliance.Full unanimity is required to admit new members into the 30-member alliance, and Turkey and Hungary were the last two NATO members to ratify Finland’s accession.Sweden’s bid to join the alliance, meanwhile, has been left hanging, with both Turkey and Hungary holding out on giving it the green light despite expressing support for NATO’s expansion.Turkey’s government accuses Sweden of being too lenient toward groups it deems to be terrorist organizations and security threats, including militant Kurdish groups and people associated with a 2016 coup attempt.More recently, Turkey was angered by a series of demonstrations in Sweden, including a protest by an anti-Islam activist who burned the Quran outside the Turkish Embassy.Hungary’s government contends some Swedish politicians have made derisive statements about the condition of Hungary’s democracy and played an active role in ensuring that billions in European Union funds were frozen over alleged rule-of-law and democracy violations.Turkish officials have said that unlike Sweden, Finland fulfilled its obligations under a memorandum signed last year under which the two countries pledged to address Turkey’s security concerns.""As a NATO member, we naturally had some expectations and requests regarding the security concerns of our country,” Akif Cagatay Kilic, a legislator from President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s governing party, told parliament before the vote. “I would like to underline the concrete steps and their implementation by Finland, which supported and shaped the decision we are taking here.”Kilic added: “I’m aware that there is a large number of people watching us from Finland. ... We can say to them: ‘Welcome to NATO.’”Some opposition parties were critical of the Turkish government’s position toward the two Nordic countries.“Unfortunately, (Erdogan’s ruling party) turned the right to veto Finland and Sweden’s membership bids into a tool for blackmail and threat. We do not approve of it,” said Hisyar Ozsoy, a legislator from the pro-Kurdish party. “We find the bargaining process (to press for) the extradition of Kurdish dissident writers, politicians and journalists ... to be ugly, wrong and unlawful.”Asked earlier this week about Sweden’s NATO membership, Erdogan told reporters: “There are certain things we expect of them. They must be fulfilled first.”Sweden, which made constitutional changes to pass tougher anti-terrorism laws, has expressed hope that it will be able to join before NATO’s July summit in Vilnius, Lithuania.“Sweden faces more significant obstacles in its bid,” Hamish Kinnear, Middle East and North Africa analyst at the risk intelligence company Verisk Maplecroft, wrote in emailed comments.“Turkey is unlikely to approve its acceptance into the alliance before the election in May. The Quran burning incident sparked popular rage in Turkey and President Tayyip Recep Erdogan won’t want to risk angering his conservative base ahead of the polls,"" Kinnear said.The accession of Finland, which has a 1,340-kilometer (832-mile) border with Russia, has geographic and political importance for NATO, said Mai’a Cross, professor of political science at Northeastern University.“Finland is at a very important strategic location and having that kind of shift from neutrality to respond to Russia’s aggression is bolstering the demonstration of the political will of NATO,” she said.Cross added that the delay gave Finland more of a chance to prepare.""Finland is already sitting in the meetings with NATO. It’s already revamping its armed forces,” she said. “So when it steps into NATO formally, it can actually hit the ground running.”",2023/03/31,,World

(AP) — New Hampshire’s prominent place in the presidential nominating calendar would be enshrined in the state’s constitution under a measure that won unanimous support Thursday in the state Senate.If 60% of the House agrees, voters would be asked in November 2024 whether to add language to the constitution mirroring an existing state law that requires the primary to be held at least seven days before any similar contest. It was one of two bills passed by the Senate as a rebuke to the Democratic National Committee, which last month approved replacing the Iowa caucus with the South Carolina primary in the leadoff position in 2024 and having New Hampshire share the second slot with Nevada.The shakeup, championed by President Joe Biden as a way to empower minority voters, has faced major pushback in New Hampshire from Republicans and Democrats alike.“To think that any political party is going to lean on the elected officials in this state to give up our tradition, that is not going to happen,” said Sen. Daryl Abbas, a Republican from Salem.“We should be united on this because our elections are done the right way.”Sen. Rebecca Perkins-Kwoka, a Democrat from Portsmouth, agreed.“The cornerstone of the first-in-the-nation primary in New Hampshire is our high engagement of the populace in the process,” she said. “What better way to reinforce that engagement than to ask the voters to decide whether our status of going first should be placed in our constitution?”The second bill, which passed 13-10 along party lines, is aimed at the fallout New Hampshire could face if it ignores the DNC rules. It would require New Hampshire delegates to national conventions to be seated with complete voting rights. The penalties for states that move up without permission haven’t been settled, but could include losing delegates.All 10 Democrats voted against the bill, arguing that lawmakers shouldn’t meddle in how parties select and seat delegates. The Republican National Committee penalized New Hampshire in 2008 and 2012 for holding the primary earlier than Feb. 1, but no one sought to pass such legislation then, said Sen. Donna Soucy, a Democrat from Manchester.""Not only is this premature, it’s unprecedented,” she said. “We should be in unison about the primary, and we should let this other problem play itself out.”Republicans argued that not seating all delegates disenfranchises voters. Sen. Sharon Carson of Londonderry said she agreed that lawmakers should be united in protecting the primary itself but shouldn’t stop there.“I think my Republican colleagues want to take that a step further, and they want to protect our Democratic colleagues in this process,” she said.",2023/03/31,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851854,March Madness came early in topsy-turvy college hoops season,"HOUSTON (AP) — Everything seemed set for a college basketball season marked by the familiar — right up until the season, anyway.There was North Carolina returning four starters from a wild ride to last year's NCAA championship game to open at No. 1 in the preseason Associated Press poll. Fellow bluebloods Kentucky, reigning champion Kansas and Duke were near the top. Instead, they crashed away to bring us here: the season's final weekend with a decidedly unexpected Final Four.So what happened? A bad bout of flawed projection? A shift in the sport itself? March Madness arriving early?“I think obviously between the transfer portal, the extra COVID year and NIL, that created a lot of opportunities, I think, for parity,” Connecticut coach Dan Hurley said this week, “where brand isn’t quite as important when there’s so much inventory in terms of players, and they can move freely. And they’re old and good.”The Huskies are headliners in Houston, both as a four-time national champion and as the team hurtling into the weekend after dispatching tournament foes with ruthless efficiency. They're also a team that was unranked in preseason, lost six of eight at midseason and was a 4-seed for the NCAA Tournament ahead of San Diego State (5), Miami (5) and Florida Atlantic (9).Of this quartet, only San Diego State (19th) was ranked in the preseason AP Top 25. That marks only the second time since the tournament's expansion to 64 teams in 1985 that three teams went from unranked in the preseason to reaching the Final Four, the other coming in 2006 with eventual champion Florida, LSU and the George Mason team led by current Hurricanes coach Jim Larrañaga.“I always say with the NCAA Tournament, if you were to start it off with the exact same brackets and start it today, we’d have four different teams in the Final Four,” Aztecs coach Brian Dutcher said. “I mean, this is a hard event to win in, and it’s almost a perfect-storm scenario.”Maybe so, but this season's journey is about the headlining teams that didn't make it here, too.Take UNC. Its riveting run last year included an epic Final Four win against Duke in the first NCAA meeting between the fierce rivals that also marked the farewell for retiring Blue Devils Hall of Fame coach Mike Krzyzewski. But this year's team looked weighed down by expectations and became the first team to go from preseason No. 1 to missing the tournament since its 1985 expansion.Yet it goes further.Three other preseason top-10 teams ( Kentucky, Creighton and Arkansas) finished unranked. Two others (Baylor and Duke) spent at least one week wandering among the ""Others Receiving Votes."" Three teams ended up going from unranked to the top 10 in the final poll, including Purdue — which became the second No. 1 seed ever to lose to a 16-seed — and Marquette joining UConn.By comparison, only two teams slid from preseason top 10 to unranked at any point last year during the first full season with the transfer portal, while one (Arizona) finished in the top 10 after opening the year unranked.In all, four teams held the No. 1 ranking this year, including Houston, Alabama and Purdue. None gave the whiff of a potential juggernaut like 2021 champ Baylor and Gonzaga combining for three losses that season.“Through the season, No. 1s were losing, rankings were always changing,” San Diego State senior guard Jared Barnett said Thursday. ""So we always felt like we had a chance.”Joel Berry II, the Final Four's Most Outstanding Player in 2017 during UNC's title run, is struck by those swings.He'll never forget the last Final Four in Houston: He was on the court in 2016 for the Tar Heels when Villanova's Kris Jenkins hit a last-second 3-pointer for the title. That crushing moment was the driving force when the Tar Heels returned a year later to claim the title that had eluded them.Now, he figures those redemption arcs are harder to complete with the transfer portal offering the equivalent of college free agency as a landscape-altering variable.“Schools like North Carolina, Kansas, Villanova, Duke, these teams can't get by anymore just bringing in (high school) All-Americans,” said Berry, now an ACC Network analyst. “These other teams have All-Americans that went to schools and maybe it didn't work out. Now they're transferring to other places where they have better opportunities.""That was a popular take among players in the locker rooms at Houston's NRG Stadium, too, with several mentioning the portal when asked about whether the season felt more wide open.“You don’t have to sit out now, so people are changing schools whenever,"" said Florida Atlantic guard Jalen Gaffney, who transferred from UConn. ""So I guess a lot of players, a lot of teams are just evening out at this point.”And to listen to them, it's both welcome and a sign of what's ahead.“High-major dudes could bounce back and go to some of these low- and mid-majors and really turn a program around,"" said UConn guard Joey Calcaterra, a graduate transfer from San Diego.“It's just cool to see the different types of teams who could step up in big moments. It's not always what you expect like in past years.”___Follow Aaron Beard on Twitter at https://twitter.com/aaronbeardap___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851855,Florida OKs bill to carry concealed guns without a permit,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Floridians will be able to carry concealed guns without a permit under a bill the Legislature sent to Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis on Thursday. The governor said at a suburban Atlanta gun store that he will sign the bill.The Senate passed the bill on a 27-13 vote. It will allow anyone who can legally own a gun in Florida to carry one without a permit. It means training and a background check will not be needed for people to carry concealed guns in public.“You don’t need a permission slip from the government to be able to exercise your Second Amendment rights,” DeSantis said to cheers at the Smyrna, Georgia, gun store that is often a location for GOP campaign events. “And as of right now there’s 25 states, so half the states, that allow that. Well in Florida, next week, we’re going to make it 26.”The arguments over the legislation were divided on political lines, with Republicans saying law-abiding citizens have a right to carry guns and protect themselves and Democrats saying a state that has seen horrific mass shootings such as the Parkland high school and Pulse nightclub massacres will become even more dangerous.“The second amendment of the Constitution gives its people the right to keep and bear arms. It doesn't say if you have a permit; it doesn't say if you've gone through training; it doesn't say if you've done a background check,” Republican Sen. Jim Boyd said. ""Bad guys are going to get guns one way or the other, and evil people are going to do bad things with guns.”Republicans argued that most people will still want to get a permit because it will allow them to carry concealed weapons in states with reciprocal agreements and to be able to purchase guns without a waiting period.But Democrats said not everybody is going to be so responsible.“I am, in fact, not worried about mass shootings through passage of this bill. I'm worried about mass idiots,” Democratic Sen. Jason Pizzo said. “People are going to die because of carelessness.”Nearly 3 million Floridians have a concealed weapons permit. While a background check and three-day waiting period will still be required to purchase a gun from a licensed dealer, they are not required for private transactions or exchanges of weapons.DeSantis has said he thinks Florida should go even further and allow people to openly carry guns. While some lawmakers have pushed for open carry, it doesn't appear the Legislature will pass such legislation.The issue was debated five years after then Republican Gov. Rick Scott signed a bill creating gun restrictions after 17 students and faculty were killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland. Under DeSantis, momentum has swung back toward expanding gun rights rather than placing limits on them.____Associated Press writer Jeff Amy in Atlanta contributed to this report.",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851856,Hail to the Chief: Inside Roman Reigns' 3 years as WWE champ,"World Wrestling Entertainment has had plenty of dominant characters over the past 50 years, but Roman Reigns continues to set his own path.When Reigns faces Cody Rhodes on Sunday in the main event of WrestleMania 39 at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles, it will be his 944th consecutive day as champion, the sixth-longest title reign in the company’s history.“You set goals and have visions of where you view yourself and what you’d like to accomplish. But, I couldn’t have written the past three years any better,” Reigns said during an interview with The Associated Press. “It feels good to come from a wrestling family that has been performers for a long time. To represent such a prestigious title reign at the tippity top of the mountain, there’s no comparison.”Reigns has a combination few sports entertainers can match — charisma, athletic ability, family pedigree and real-life experiences where he beat the odds.That has also made Reigns a beloved and respected heel (bad guy). Fans cheer when Reigns demands them to “acknowledge me” when speaking in the middle of the ring.That wasn’t always the case. Reigns entered WWE in 2012 but was a polarizing figure among fans for a long time because majority owner Vince McMahon had tried to position him as a champion and a babyface (good guy). Fans passionately resented Reigns because his rise to the top felt forced.That changed in the fall of 2018 when Reigns— whose real name is Joe Anoa’i — announced he was stepping away due to a recurrence of leukemia. Anoa’i, an All-ACC defensive tackle at Georgia Tech, was first diagnosed in 2007 after signing a free-agent contract with the Minnesota Vikings. He went into remission two years later.After four months of treatment, Reigns returned in February 2019. He was scheduled for the main event during 2020's WrestleMania but pulled out due to health concerns at the start of the coronavirus pandemic. Even though the show occurred in the Orlando training center and no fans were in attendance, Reigns was immunocompromised, and his wife was pregnant with twins.“There was always that struggle, and I don’t blame them,” Reigns said of his relationship with fans. “Everything we’re doing now and how it is displayed — the character work, the personality, the storylines, all of that the information we’re giving our fans, we’re keeping everything as logical as you can in a wrestling show.”When Reigns returned to WWE events in August 2020, not only had he found a way to tap into becoming a heel, but it was with Paul Heyman by his side. Heyman had a long partnership with Brock Lesnar and different stints creating storylines for WWE, and he and Reigns spent months developing a way to reboot his character.Reigns would win the Universal Championship for the second time less than two weeks after returning. He added the WWE belt by defeating Lesnar at last year's WrestleMania to become the Undisputed Champion.Real-life cousins Jey and Jimmy Uso teamed with Reigns in the fall of 2020 after feuds with him to form “The Bloodline” faction with Reigns as its Tribal Chief. The Usos go into WrestleMania with a record 623 days as tag team champions.Anoa’i is the son of Sika of The Wild Samoans and the brother of Rosey, who also worked in WWE before his death 2017. He is also cousins with the late Umaga and WWE champion Yokozuna. The Usos’ father is former WWE superstar Rikishi.Reigns admitted he initially didn’t like the idea of facing Jey “and beating him into The Bloodline,” but the more he thought about it, the more it made sense.“When these ideas in real-time started happening, it became a chain reaction, a domino effect,” Reigns said. “It’s been like an onion, peeling open, left and right, these awesome opportunities and different rabbit holes to dive down with these different characters we’ve involved.”Solo Sikoa, the younger brother of the Usos, has become part of the story over the past six months as the family enforcer.As the Head of the Table, Reigns exudes the qualities of the best fictional crime family bosses of the past 50 years. The T-shirts marketed by WWE evoke comparisons to “Scarface” with a black background and red font. The storyline over the past three years — especially the past three months with friction between Reigns and Jey Uso — conjures up Michael Corleone from “The Godfather” trilogy.Heyman, though, said the central concept for Reigns as the Tribal Chief was based on Colonel Walter E. Kurtz from “Apocalypse Now.”“The reason why is because the story is of a soldier so great, he could not be stopped,” Heyman said of Kurtz. “He goes rogue and takes over this community, becomes their leader, and their end all be all. He then has to live up to being this navigator into the future and has the responsibility and the accountability of living up to those expectations. And at some point, that becomes a burden and makes him resent those with such lofty expectations for the person who positioned himself as their leader. And in that resentment comes this villainous bitterness.”Working with Reigns has also been a full circle moment for Heyman, who was the on-screen manager for The Wild Samoans in the late ’80s.John Cena says Reigns is one of the greats because he has created an environment for many to thrive.“Roman, you see very selectively. Yet he’s been able to rise up six to seven people to be in another bracket of relevance. And that for me has never been done,” Cena said. “Usually the top guy is the top guy. ... It’s that moment to take what you can from them, then move on. Just being in Roman’s orbit puts you in another bracket. He makes so many more people better, creating a better program and more people watching and talking. It’s not just a one-man show.”If Reigns were to defeat Rhodes on Sunday, he would be on pace for the sixth title reign of at least 1,000 days and the first since Hulk Hogan held the belt for 1,474 days from 1984-88. However, Rhodes has been riding momentum since returning to WWE last year, and conventional wisdom is that Reigns will drop the title.The Rhodes-Reigns matchup also carries its own set of family dynamics. The late Dusty Rhodes trained Reigns in NXT, which was WWE’s developmental program.“He’s critical early on as far as instilling confidence. He saw the man I would become opposed to what I was looking at in the mirror. I’ve lived with that and carried that with me anytime I have doubts,” said Reigns of Dusty Rhodes.The Usos tag team reign could end when they face Sami Zayn and Kevin Owens. Zayn was also part of “The Bloodline” for nearly a year before turning on Reigns.If “The Bloodline” does break up after WrestleMania, Reigns’ character will undergo another evolution. Whatever happens next, Reigns said he will continue wrestling for a long time. He still undergoes regular blood tests to guard against a recurrence of leukemia.“I feel good. I take care of myself. I’m not running around doing anything crazy. I raise children and dominate the wrestling game,” said Reigns, who turns 38 in May. “If they keep cutting these insane checks, I’ll stay around.”___AP sports writer Dan Gelston in Philadelphia contributed.___AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851857,Probe: Delays in district's schools awards not deliberate,"RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — A third-party investigation into delays by a northern Virginia public school district in recognizing student achievements on a standardized test found no evidence the delays were deliberate, the superintendent said this week.Fairfax County Public Schools Superintendent Michelle Reid also said in a Wednesday letter to the community that the probe found “no evidence of any inequity or racial bias” in the way schools handled notification to those designated “commended students” by the National Merit Scholarship Corporation.Fairfax County was among a handful of northern Virginia public school districts that acknowledged around the start of the year delayed notification of some commended student awards. The issue drew widespread attention after Gov. Glenn Youngkin and other elected officials highlighted parents' concerns and asked for an investigation.Students who receive the award finish in the top 3% nationally on a standardized test, but below the top 1% that qualifies them as a scholarship semifinalist. Some parents said the delayed notifications could have affected students' college or scholarship applications, and other parents and activists alleged the district chose to withhold the commendations to downplay individual achievement in favor of equity.When complaints about the delayed notifications first emerged at the prestigious Thomas Jefferson School for Science and Technology, Youngkin said he wanted to get to the bottom of what “appeared to be an egregious, deliberate attempt to disadvantage high-performing students at one of the best schools in the country.”Fairfax County went on to acknowledge notification delays at additional schools, as did other northern Virginia districts.Youngkin asked Attorney General Jason Miyares, a fellow Republican, to launch an investigation. He suggested the failure to notify students of their awards could be a violation of the Virginia Human Rights Act, which bans discrimination on race and other factors.That investigation is still ongoing, according to Miyares spokeswoman Victoria LaCivita.“It’s encouraging that FCPS is working to be more transparent about the inconsistencies surrounding their National Merit award decisions and process,” she said in a statement Thursday.An internal review by Fairfax schools first found there was no validity to claims that the delays were deliberate or done in the name of equity, according to a summary of the key findings of the external investigation. But Reid went on to retain the law firm Sands Anderson to conduct its own probe, which came to the same finding.As part of its work, the firm conducted 29 witness interviews and “had open access to FCPS documents and records,” the summary said.The report found that 15 Fairfax County high schools notified their commended students before Nov. 1, 2022; eight did not. The lack of a division-wide policy for providing such notice was a contributing factor in the delays, the summary said.Reid said in her letter that the district has developed a new regulation that outlines the notification process all high schools will now follow going forward.The investigation did not identify any Thomas Jefferson student or parent “who believed a student’s admission to their college or university of choice was adversely affected” by the delayed notices, according to the summary.It also said staff at the impacted schools other than Thomas Jefferson reported that they had not received complaints from parents or the school community regarding the awards notification.A spokeswoman for Youngkin, Macaulay Porter, said the governor looks forward to the independent findings of Miyares' investigation into three school divisions.“When allegations that merit awards were withheld from students came to light, the governor took immediate action,” she said.She also said the governor, who has made parental rights in education a key focus of his time in office, was disappointed in Virginia Democrats who blocked a legislative proposal he sought intended to ensure parental notification of scholastic awards.Democratic Sen.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851858,Donald Trump indicted; expected to surrender early next week,"NEW YORK (AP) — Donald Trump has been indicted by a Manhattan grand jury, a historic reckoning after years of investigations into his personal, political and business dealings and an abrupt jolt to his bid to retake the White House.The exact nature of the charges was unclear Friday because the indictment remained under seal, but they stem from payments made during the 2016 presidential campaign to silence claims of an extramarital sexual encounter. Prosecutors said they were working to coordinate Trump’s surrender, which could happen early next week. They did not say whether they intended to seek prison time in the event of a conviction, a development that wouldn’t prevent Trump from seeking and assuming the presidency.The indictment, the first against a former U.S. president, injects a local district attorney’s office into the heart of a national presidential race and ushers in criminal proceedings in a city that the ex-president for decades called home. Arriving at a time of deep political divisions, the charges are likely to reinforce rather than reshape dueling perspectives of those who see accountability as long overdue and those who, like Trump, feel the Republican is being targeted for political purposes by a Democratic prosecutor.Trump, who has denied any wrongdoing and has repeatedly assailed the investigation, called the indictment “political persecution” and predicted it would damage Democrats in 2024. In a statement confirming the charges, defense lawyers Susan Necheles and Joseph Tacopina said Trump “did not commit any crime. We will vigorously fight this political prosecution in court.”A spokesman for the Manhattan district attorney’s office confirmed the indictment and said prosecutors had reached out to Trump’s defense team to coordinate a surrender. Tacopina said Trump is “likely” to turn himself in on Tuesday.“We’re working out those logistics right now,” Tacopina said on NBC's “Today” show Friday morning. “He's not gonna hole up in Mar-a-Lago.”Tacopina insisted that Trump would not take a plea deal: “There's no crime.”Trump was asked to surrender Friday but his lawyers said the Secret Service needed additional time as they made security preparations, two people familiar with the matter told The Associated Press. The people spoke on condition of anonymity because they couldn’t publicly discuss security details.District Attorney Alvin Bragg left his office Thursday evening without commenting.The case centers on well-chronicled allegations from a period in 2016 when Trump’s celebrity past collided with his political ambitions. Prosecutors for months scrutinized money paid to porn actor Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal, whom he feared would go public with claims that they had extramarital sexual encounters with him.The timing of the indictment appeared to come as a surprise to Trump campaign officials following news reports that criminal charges were likely weeks away. The former president was at Mar-a-Lago, his Florida estate, on Thursday and filmed an interview with a conservative commentator earlier in the day.For a man whose presidency was defined by one obliterated norm after another, the indictment sets up yet another never-before-seen spectacle — a former president having his fingerprints and mug shot taken, and then facing arraignment. For security reasons, his booking is expected to be carefully choreographed to avoid crowds inside or outside the courthouse.The prosecution also means that Trump will have to simultaneously fight for his freedom and political future, while also fending off potentially more perilous legal threats, including investigations into attempts by him and his allies to undo the 2020 presidential election as well as into the hoarding of hundreds of classified documents.In fact, New York was until recently seen as an unlikely contender to be the first place to prosecute Trump, who continues to face long-running investigations in Atlanta and Washington that could also result in charges. Unlike those inquiries, the Manhattan case concerns allegations against Trump that occurred before he became president and are unrelated to his much-publicized efforts to overturn the election.The indictment comes as Trump seeks to reassert control of the Republican Party and stave off a slew of one-time allies who may threaten his bid for the presidential nomination. An expected leading rival in the race, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, called the indictment “un-American” in a statement Thursday night that pointedly did not mention Trump’s name.In bringing the charges, Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney, is embracing an unusual case that was investigated by two previous sets of prosecutors, both of which declined to take the politically explosive step of seeking Trump’s indictment. The case may also turn in part on the testimony of a key witness, Trump’s former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen, who pleaded guilty to federal charges arising from the hush money payments, including making false statements.The probe’s fate seemed uncertain until word got out in early March that Bragg had invited Trump to testify before a grand jury, a signal that prosecutors were close to bringing charges.Trump’s attorneys declined the invitation, but a lawyer closely allied with the former president briefly testified in an effort to undercut Cohen’s credibility.Trump himself raised anticipation that he would be indicted soon, issuing a statement earlier this month in which he predicted an imminent arrest and called for protests. He did not repeat that call in a fresh statement Thursday, but the New York Police Department told its 36,000 officers to be fully mobilized and ready to respond to any potential protests or unrest.Late in the 2016 presidential campaign, Cohen paid Daniels $130,000 to keep her silent about what she says was a sexual encounter with Trump a decade earlier after they met at a celebrity golf tournament.Cohen was then reimbursed by Trump’s company, the Trump Organization, which also rewarded the lawyer with bonuses and extra payments logged internally as legal expenses. Over several months, Cohen said, the company paid him $420,000.Earlier in 2016, Cohen also arranged for the publisher of the supermarket tabloid the National Enquirer to pay McDougal $150,000 to squelch her story of a Trump affair in a journalistically dubious practice known as “catch-and-kill.”The payments to the women were intended to buy secrecy, but they backfired almost immediately as details of the arrangements leaked to the news media.Federal prosecutors in New York ultimately charged Cohen in 2018 with violating federal campaign finance laws, arguing that the payments amounted to impermissible help to Trump’s presidential campaign. Cohen pleaded guilty to those charges and unrelated tax evasion counts and served time in federal prison.Trump was implicated in court filings as having knowledge of the arrangements — obliquely referred to in charging documents as “Individual 1” — but U.S. prosecutors at the time balked at bringing charges against him. The Justice Department has a longtime policy against indicting a sitting president in federal court.Bragg’s predecessor as district attorney, Cyrus Vance Jr., then took up the investigation in 2019. While that probe initially focused on the hush money payments, Vance’s prosecutors moved on to other matters, including an examination of Trump’s business dealings and tax strategies.Vance ultimately charged the Trump Organization and its chief financial officer with tax fraud related to fringe benefits paid to some of the company’s top executives.The hush money matter became known around the D.A.’s office as the “zombie case,” with prosecutors revisiting it periodically but never opting to bring charges.Bragg saw it differently. After the Trump Organization was convicted on the tax fraud charges in December, he brought fresh eyes to the well-worn case, hiring longtime white-collar prosecutor Matthew Colangelo to oversee the probe and convening a new grand jury.Cohen became a key witness, meeting with prosecutors nearly two-dozen times, turning over emails, recordings and other evidence and testifying before the grand jury.Trump has long decried the Manhattan investigation as “the greatest witch hunt in history.” He has also lashed out at Bragg, calling the prosecutor, who is Black, racist against white people.The criminal charges in New York are the latest salvo in a profound schism between Trump and his hometown — a reckoning for a one-time favorite son who grew rich and famous building skyscrapers, hobnobbing with celebrities and gracing the pages of the city’s gossip press.Trump, who famously riffed in 2016 that he “could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody” and “wouldn’t lose voters,” now faces a threat to his liberty in a borough where more than 75% of voters — many of them potential jurors — went against him in the last election._____Tucker and Long reported from Washington.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851859,"McClanahan sharp, Rays blank Tigers 4-0 on opening day","ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) — Shane McClanahan pitched six sharp innings, Jose Siri and Wander Franco homered and the Tampa Bay Rays opened their silver anniversary season with a 4-0 victory over the Detroit Tigers on Thursday.“Hopefully it's just a start,” said McClanahan, an All-Star a year ago when the Rays made the playoffs for the fourth consecutive season.With an opening day roster that only includes two newcomers to the team — pitchers Zach Eflin and Kevin Kelly — the Rays feel they have everything it takes to not only earn another postseason berth, but make a deep run.Solid pitching, timely hitting and stellar defense — like Manuel Margot's diving catch in right field saved at least one run in the seventh inning — once again figure to be the key to the budget-minded club's success.“You can't always win with home runs,” Franco said through a translator.“That’s a game-changing play, but I’ve never really been in this building where haven’t played elite defense. It’s one of their calling cards. They make good plays. They finish plays, which is key,"" Tigers manager A.J. Hinch said. ""We needed to get something to happen to get back into the game. That would have been a critical one.”Miguel Cabrera, beginning what he has said will be his last season, had one of Detroit’s six hits — a seventh-inning double — that moved him into a tie with Ichiro Suzuki for 23rd on the all-time hit list with 3,089.McClanahan (1-0) gave up four hits, struck out six and walked one in his second opening day start.Randy Arozarena and Luke Raley also drove in runs charged to Eduardo Rodriguez (0-1), who yielded Siri's homer in the third inning.Franco, who sat out the last couple of games in spring training due to right quadriceps tightness, provided added insurance with a solo homer in the eighth.“Any time you hit a ball like that,” the shortstop said of his homer that traveled an estimated 402 feet into the stands in in left-center field, “you feel healthy.”For the Rays, who've made the playoffs the past four seasons, Thursday was the start of a celebration of the team's first 25 years.They wore throwback Devil Rays jerseys the team donned during the first decade of its existence, hosting the same opponent Tampa Bay faced in the first-ever regular season game at Tropicana Field on March 31, 1998.More than a decade after last throwing a pitch in a Tampa Bay uniform, former big leaguer James Shields was invited to return to “symbolically” retire from the franchise he helped transform from a perennial loser into a playoff contender.Shields, who spent parts of seven seasons with the Rays before being traded to the Kansas City Royals in December 2012, also wore a throwback jersey, too, and threw out the ceremonial first pitch.The 41-year-old was a draft pick of the Devil Rays in 2000 and was the leader of a pitching staff that was one of the keys to a surprising run to the World Series in 2008 — the year the franchise dropped the “Devil” from their nickname and made the playoffs for the first time.FULL HOUSEThe Rays routinely rank near the bottom of the major leagues in attendance, but again announced a sellout of 25,025 on opening day. Excluding 2020, when fans were not allowed into stadiums due to the coronavirus pandemic, the team has sold out 17 consecutive home openers.LAST TIME AROUNDCabrera is in his 21st season, 16th with the Tigers. Appearing in his 2,700th career game, he batted seventh and finished 1 for 4. Former Rays player Austin Meadows was 3 for 4 with a double for Detroit.UP NEXTFriday is an off day. The three-game series resumes Saturday, with off-season acquisition Zach Eflin making his debut for the Rays and RHP Spencer Turnbull scheduled to start for the Tigers.___More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/31,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851861,"Rutschman has 5 hits in opener, Orioles outlast Red Sox 10-9","BOSTON (AP) — The last time Adley Rutschman recalls feeling this level of emotion on a baseball field was playing in front of intimate, 5,000-seat crowds in college at Oregon State.He trumped that experience at Fenway Park on Thursday in his first career opening day start.“This blows that out of the water,” Rutschman said.Rutschman became the first catcher in major league history with five hits in an opener, and the Baltimore Orioles survived a wild ninth inning to beat the Boston Red Sox 10-9.“To have that close game in the ninth inning and the crowd get so loud. You kind of sit there and say, ‘This is pretty cool,’” said Rutschman, the top overall pick in the 2019 draft.Rutschman — who debuted for the Orioles last May and quickly became indispensable to the young, resurgent club — homered in his first at-bat and finished 5-for-5 with a career-best four RBIs and a walk on a chilly day at Fenway Park, with a temperature of 38 degrees at first pitch.Ramon Urias hit a two-run homer for Baltimore, which finished with 15 hits, nine walks and five stolen bases.Kyle Gibson (1-0) allowed four runs and six hits over five-plus innings to earn his first opening-day victory since his 2021 All-Star season with Texas. Gibson gave up an RBI groundout in the first inning before retiring nine straight Red Sox hitters.The Orioles nearly gave the game away in the ninth.With Baltimore leading 10-7, closer Félix Bautista walked pinch-hitter Raimel Tapia. Alex Verdugo followed with a single and advanced to second on an error by center fielder Cedric Mullins.Rafael Devers struck out. Justin Turner then reached on an infield single to third when Urias’ throw was wide, scoring Tapia. Masataka Yoshida grounded to shortstop Jorge Mateo, who stepped on second for the force but threw wildly to first, allowing Verdugo to score.Bautista struck out Adam Duvall on three pitches to end it and earn the save.The Orioles scored four runs in the fourth and three in the fifth to take an 8-2 lead. Baltimore led 10-4 before Bryan Baker allowed three runs in the eighth to give the Red Sox some hope.The eighth could have been even better for the Red Sox had Devers, who led off the inning, not become the first player in major league history to strike out on a pitch clock violation. Devers was looking down and kicking debris off his cleats when umpire Lance Barksdale signaled a violation that resulted in strike three.“There’s no excuse,” said Alex Cora, who dropped to 0-5 in opening-day games as Boston's manager. “They know the rules.”Boston offseason addition and two-time Cy Young Award winner Corey Kluber (0-1) struggled in his Fenway debut, surrendering five runs on six hits and four walks in 3 1/3 innings.“Less than ideal,” Kluber said. “Didn't turn out the way I would have hoped for.”TRAINER’S ROOMRed Sox: Christian Arroyo stayed in the game after taking an inadvertent cleat to the side of his head in the second inning. Arroyo was applying a tag to Rutschman at second base as he attempted to stretch out a single. Rutschman’s leg flipped over as he slid awkwardly. ... LHP James Paxton was placed on the 15-day inured list (retroactive to March 27) with a strained right hamstring.GOOD COMPANYRutschman, one of six Baltimore players making his first opening-day appearance, became the youngest Oriole to homer in his first opening-day at-bat since Cal Ripken Jr. in 1984.BIG BAGSThe Orioles took advantage of MLB's bigger bases — going from 15- to 18-inch squares — that are being used for the first time this season. Baltimore hadn't stolen five bases in a game since last June 24 against the White Sox. Mullins and Jorge Mateo swiped two bags apiece, and Adam Frazier got a huge jump on his steal against reliever Ryan Brasier. There was nothing Boston catcher Reese McGuire could do to stop them and on the majority of Baltimore's steals, he didn't bother to throw.FINAL SPOTSRight-hander Kaleb Ort and Tapia earned Boston’s final two roster spots to open the season. Tapia got the nod over Jarren Duran, who was sent down to Triple-A Worcester. Ort pitched a scoreless sixth with one strikeout Thursday.UP NEXTOrioles: RHP Dean Kremer will make is sixth career start against Boston when the three-game series resumes on Saturday. In 11 road starts last season, he went 5-3 with a 3.63 ERA.Red Sox: LHP Chris Sale, who has pitched in only 11 games over the past three years due to injuries, is set to begin his seventh season in Boston.___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851862,"American detained in Russia a 'brave, committed' journalist","Working as a journalist in Moscow seemed a natural fit for Evan Gershkovich, the son of immigrants from the Soviet Union who grew up speaking Russian at home in Princeton, N.J.After he graduated in 2014 from Bowdoin College, one of the country’s most selective schools, however, “it took me awhile to figure out that journalism was the career for me,” he said in a 2020 interview on the school's website.Now Russia's Federal Security Service says the 31-year-old American reporter for The Wall Street Journal has been arrested on charges of espionage. The FSB, the country's top security agency and successor to the KGB, said Gershkovich was collecting information on an enterprise of the military-industrial complex.The Journal denied the allegations and demanded his release.Sarah Conly, a retired philosophy professor at Bowdoin, recalled that Gershkovich was unafraid to speak up while other students hung back.“He was lively and outspoken and not afraid to express his views,” she said in an email. “I have followed his career with admiration and am horrified at this outcome.”After college, Gershkovich worked for an environmental organization in Southeast Asia, then moved to New York and worked as a cook until joining The New York Times as a clerk on the foreign desk.Two years later, excited by what he’d learned at the Times, he wanted to get reporting experience and found a slot in 2017 at the Moscow Times, an English-language news site in the Russian capital.“When you start reporting in Russia, you often hear that it will be very hard to get people to talk,” he said in the Bowdoin interview. “And while that may be true of Russian officialdom -– though not all of it -– I have found that if you go looking for the right people, many of them want to tell their stories.“Of course, some will want their comments to be from an unnamed source, which means, as a reporter, you have to make sure you speak to them over encrypted channels and protect their identities. But they’re out there,” he said.Gershkovich later moved to the French news agency Agence France-Presse and then to the Journal.Friends and colleagues were shocked by the news and took to social media to describe him as a committed journalist, dismissing the allegations as bogus and ridiculous.“Journalism is not a crime,” they posted.Henry Foy, the Financial Times' European diplomatic correspondent based in Brussels, tweeted: “Evan is an exemplary foreign correspondent, a brilliant reporter and a wonderful, kind-hearted friend.”Joshua Yaffa, a Russia-Ukraine reporter for The New Yorker, posted: “Evan was not unaware or naïve about the risks. It’s not like he was in Russia because no one bothered to tell him it was dangerous. He is a brave, committed, professional journalist who traveled to Russia to report on stories of import and interest.”Oliver Carrol, a foreign correspondent for The Economist, tweeted that he hopes Gershkovich's bravery “carries through in these very dark hours. It’s something you wouldn’t wish on your worst enemy. Let alone Evan, who is one of the nicest guys in journalism.”Many foreign journalists pulled out of Russia after the country enacted laws to punish anyone who discredits Russian forces in Ukraine, and the U.S. State Department has repeatedly advised all Americans to leave the country.The new law has left many of the remaining journalists uncertain about what would be considered crossing the line. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, “those carrying out normal journalistic activity will obviously keep working, if they have proper accreditation. There will be no problems with that.”Russian political analyst Tatiana Stanovaya tweeted that ”the problem is that the recently updated legislation and the FSB’s interpretation of espionage today allow for the imprisonment of anyone who is simply interested in military affairs.”Gershkovich is the first American reporter to be arrested on espionage charges in Russia since 1986, when Nicholas Daniloff of U.S. News and World Report was arrested by the KGB. Daniloff was released without charge 20 days later in a swap for an employee of the Soviet Union’s U.N. mission who was arrested by the FBI, also on spying charges.One other American is in prison on a spying conviction: former Marine and corporate security executive Paul Whelan, arrested in 2018 on charges the United States and his family say were trumped-up.For Whelan’s brother David, Gershkovich’s arrest is painful.“Our family is sorry to hear that another American family will have to experience the same trauma that we have had to endure for the past 1,553 days,” he said in a statement.",2023/03/31,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851864,How California reparations proposals could become law,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — Reparations for Black residents in California will move to the state Legislature once a first-in-the-nation task force submits its recommendations and findings by July 1.But the task force will not propose a cash restitution amount for individuals, opting instead to leave it to lawmakers to figure out how much descendants of U.S. chattel slavery are owed.The panel on Wednesday endorsed calculation methodologies showing that California could owe African American residents more than $800 billion just for discrimination in policing and housing loans. California’s annual budget is nearly $300 billion.WHAT WILL LAWMAKERS DO NEXT?Two task force members are also state lawmakers and will spearhead efforts to turn the panel's recommendations into legislation that can pass the Assembly and Senate and get the support of Gov. Gavin Newsom.State Assemblymember Reggie Jones-Sawyer said they aim to introduce reparations legislation in January. Legislation usually takes months before passing both chambers and reaching the governor's desk.State. Sen Steven Bradford introduced a bill to keep the panel going for another year so members can assist lawmakers as they consider the group’s recommendations.WHERE WILL CALIFORNIA GET MONEY TO FUND REPARATIONS?Bradford has suggested setting aside 0.5% of the state’s annual budget — or $1.5 billion — every year for a reparations fund that could pay for ongoing programs for free health care, education and homebuying assistance, among other things.Democratic Assemblymember Lori Wilson, who chairs the Legislative Black Caucus, said it’s too early to know where money for reparations plans would ultimately come from, but she looks forward to “that robust discussion.""California Senate Pro-Tem Toni Atkins said in a statement it's too early to comment on any possible reparations legislation. Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon “looks forward to studying” the task force's final report, spokesperson John Casey said in an email.WHAT ARE OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS FOR REPAIR?The task force recommends lawmakers establish a California American Freedmen Affairs Agency to help people with reparations claims, among other duties.Other policy proposals include paying incarcerated inmates market value for their labor, establishing free wellness centers in Black communities and adopting a K-12 Black studies curriculum.CALIFORNIA WAS NEVER A SLAVE STATE. WHY IS IT CONSIDERING REPARATIONS?A groundbreaking report issued by the task force last year lays out how California and local governments used racist laws and policies to discriminate against African American residents in a host of areas, including housing, labor, education and the criminal justice system.Black people are overrepresented in state prisons and county jails. They also make up about 6% of the state's population but 30% of its homeless population.WHAT ARE THE ARGUMENTS AGAINST REPARATIONS IN CALIFORNIA?In general, critics of reparations say current taxpayers who never owned slaves should not have to compensate the descendants of slavery. Some people say the federal government should be responsible for paying descendants.Bob Woodson, a prominent Black conservative, calls reparations impractical, controversial and counterproductive. “No amount of money could ever ‘make right’ the evil of slavery, and it is insulting to suggest that it could,” he said.HOW DID THE TASK FORCE START?Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, signed legislation in 2020 creating the nine-member task force. The panel began meeting in 2021.Its charge was to document slavery and its effects on descendants today, recommend ways to educate the public on the task force’s findings, and propose how the state can repair the harm, including an apology, policy changes and financial compensation.WHAT’S THE STATUS OF OTHER REPARATIONS EFFORTS?Similar attempts are moving along in other parts of the country although reparations proposals have stalled at the federal level. In New York, lawmakers reintroduced legislation this year to create a commission to study reparations. In San Francisco, the Board of Supervisors expressed general support of a reparations plan drafted by an advisory committee but stopped short of endorsing specific proposals.—-Har reported from San Francisco.",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851865,Mulkey says no contact with Griner since return from Russia,"DALLAS (AP) — LSU coach Kim Mulkey has not spoken to Brittney Griner since the former Baylor star was freed from a Russian prison and returned to the U.S., but Mulkey did have a message for her ex-player.“I’m glad she’s back,” Mulkey said at her Final Four news conference Thursday, a day before the Tigers' meeting with Virginia Tech in the national semifinals. “I’m glad she’s safe, she’s sound. I think everybody is.”Mulkey was criticized in September for not offering any words of support or encouragement for Griner, the three-time All-American and WNBA star who was arrested in February 2022 in Russia on drug-related charges and was later convicted and sentenced to nine years in a Russian jail.“And you won't,” Mulkey interrupted in the fall when asked for a reaction to Griner's situation by a reporter who suggested the coach hadn't weighed in.After Griner's release in December in a dramatic prisoner swap with Russia, Mulkey issued a statement through ESPN expressing relief over the news.Baylor was the first 40-0 national champion when Griner was a junior in 2012. The Bears lost in the regional finals a year later. Baylor also made the Final Four when Griner was a freshman.After her Baylor career, Griner came out. Days after she was the WNBA's No. 1 overall pick by Phoenix in 2013, Griner criticized Mulkey, saying her former coach forced her to keep her sexual orientation private because it could hurt recruiting at the private Baptist university.Griner has said she plans to resume her career with the Mercury; she missed last season while imprisoned in Russia.DADDY-DAUGHTER DATEVirginia Tech coach Kenny Brooks, a self-professed Dallas Cowboys fan, has already reminisced about sitting not far from star quarterback Dak Prescott six years ago when Prescott's alma mater, Mississippi State, ended Connecticut's 111-game winning streak in the national semifinals in Dallas.Turns out there's another reason that Final Four was special for Brooks, who had just finished his first season with the Hokies while Prescott was fresh off an NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year debut.Brooks took his middle daughter, Chloe, on that trip, and remembers her being in a tough place mentally because of an injury.“We had the best time,” Brooks said. “I wish I could give you a story, a Disney story ending and saying, ‘Hey, baby, one day we’re going to be here too,’ but we didn’t. But it was a memorable moment, and to come full circle to know that 2023, I’m going to bring my team. Like Taylor (Soule) says, ‘We’re not at the Final Four. We’re in the Final Four.’”FIRST IMPRESSIONSSouth Carolina star Aliyah Boston remembers watching the Gamecocks win their first national championship six years ago in the same arena where they'll try for the program's third title.Coach Dawn Staley's team beat Mississippi State 67-55 after the Bulldogs had ended UConn's run with an overtime buzzer-beater in the semifinals.“I definitely remember watching that game,” Boston said. “Winning a national title was pretty cool because I knew that I also wanted to do that and play under coach Staley.”Ditto for guard Zia Cooke: “I think after I watched that game, I told my dad, ‘I want to go there. I want to go there,.”REMEMBER WHENIowa star Caitlin Clark had a pair of teammates at the podium for the news conference previewing their South Carolina game. They were asked for their favorite Clark-like moment.Gabbie Marshall was torn between whether the opponent was Iowa State or Ohio State. But she remembers it was at home.“She had come down and hit three logo shots in a row,” Marshall said. “I remember looking over, like, ‘What is going on?

For a golf fan, I think it will be awesome.”Will the topic of conversation under the huge oak tree outside the Augusta National clubhouse be about the lengthening of the par-5 13th or the latest motion filed in an antitrust lawsuit between LIV Golf and the PGA Tour?And who wouldn't pay to be upstairs in the clubhouse on Tuesday night for the annual Masters Club dinner for past champions, seven of them now with LIV Golf. As defending champion, Scheffler is in charge of the menu, not keeping the peace.“I keep trying to get Scottie to address the elephant in the room, but I don't think he's going to,"" Jordan Spieth said with a laugh. “I keep poking him: ‘It’s your job to address the elephant in the room when you speak. It's not just a thank-you.' I don't think he's biting. He doesn't bite on a lot of what I have to say.”Indeed, this really could be a Masters unlike any other.Dustin Johnson was thought to be on the fence about leaving for LIV Golf out of concern he wouldn't be able to return to Augusta National, where he set the scoring record in 2020. He left for LIV in June for a signing fee reported to be in the $150 million range.And any concerns about playing — for Johnson and everyone else — were put to rest in December when Masters Chairman Fred Ridley said the invitation list would not change regardless of where players made their living. At least not for this year.Ridley also made it clear he wasn't happy about the state of golf since the rival league — run by Greg Norman, paid for by the Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund — came along. He referenced nine Masters champions who had become golfing heroes. Conspicuously missing from his list was three-time winner Phil Mickelson, once a popular figure in golf.“They have shown respect for those who came before them and blazed a trail for future generations. Golf is better because of them,” Ridley said. ""Regrettably, recent actions have divided men’s professional golf by diminishing the virtues of the game and the meaningful legacies of those who built it.”Most PGA Tour players have not seen the likes of Johnson, Mickelson and Brooks Koepka since the British Open. Cameron Smith won the claret jug and then joined LIV six weeks later.“Inside the ropes, even the people who have scuffles, it’s just a working environment,” Schauffele said. “It will be cool to have everyone back in the same office.”No one is quite sure what to expect. Most LIV players have competed no more than nine times since St. Andrews in 54-hole events with 48-man fields.Their world ranking has plummeted because LIV still doesn't get points. Johnson was No. 16 in the world when he left St. Andrews. Now he is at No. 68. Koepka dropped out of the top 100 in the world (No. 111) for the first time in 10 years.“Just because the guys aren't ranked, they're still top-ranked players, and us pros know that,” Schauffele said. “When some of those boys are playing well, they're hard to beat. Some of them left when they were hot, some of them left a little cold in terms of performance. But we know how good everyone is.""Another question leading to the 87th Masters Tournament, which starts April 6, is how well Woods can play. He remains the biggest draw, especially now because no one knows when they will see him next. Woods can hit all the shots. His problem is walking to the next one, over four days, on one of the toughest walks in golf.Still hobbled by his February 2021 car crash that mangled his right leg, Woods managed to make the cut last year in the Masters and the PGA Championship (he withdrew after three rounds). He made the cut at Riviera and shot 67 on Saturday in his lone start in 2023. But it took a toll, and he has sat out for seven weeks to be ready for Augusta.“It wouldn't surprise me at all if he got us on the edge of our seat for the first couple of days,” said two-time U.S. Open champion Curtis Strange, now an ESPN analyst. “But can he sustain it? I think that LA just made me look forward more to the Masters, because he’s still got something in that body.”McIlroy seems to have been wearing two hats over the last year. He got back to No. 1 in the world last fall while speaking out against the Saudi rival league and leading the change to a remodeled PGA Tour structure of big purses and small fields to reward the best players.He has been at the forefront of acrimony, too, taking digs at Norman on more than one occasion and then refusing to acknowledge Patrick Reed when they were on the practice range in Dubai in January.Perhaps it's enough to ease the pressure of winning the major that has eluded him. Only two players — Sergio Garcia (19) and Mark O'Meara (15) — have played 15 times or more before winning the Masters. This is McIlroy's 15th appearance.“I don't think anything is in real need of tons of practice,” said McIlroy, whose final event was third place in the Match Play. “I think my game's in really good shape. So just keep it ticking over and work on the shots that I need for Augusta National, and away we go.”___AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/31,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851879,MASTERS '23: A hole-by-hole look at Augusta National,"AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) — A hole-by-hole look at Augusta National, site of the 87th Masters to be played April 6-9, with famous shots played at each, the average score and where each hole ranks in difficulty since 1934:No. 1, 445 yards, par 4 (Tea Olive): This slight dogleg right plays uphill and has a deep bunker requiring a 317-yard carry off the tee. The bunker has a tongue in the left side, so anything that enters the front of the bunker might be blocked by the lip. A bunker is left of the green, which falls off sharply at the back and to the right.Masters memory: Charl Schwartzel used a 6-iron to pitch a low-running shot from the right mounds across the green and holed the shot for birdie to begin the final round of his 2011 victory.Average score and rank: 4.239 (6th)___No. 2, 575 yards, par 5 (Pink Dogwood): A dogleg left that can be reached in two with a good drive. A fairway bunker on the right comes into play, though the right conditions could allow for it to be carried. A drive kept down the left side shortens the hole, but leaves a downhill lie to a green guarded by two deep bunkers in the front.Masters memory: Louis Oosthuizen hit a 4-iron from 253 yards in the final round of 2012 that landed on the front of the green and rolled some 90 feet into the cup for the first albatross at this hole in Masters history. It took him from a one-shot deficit to a two-shot lead. He went on to lose in a playoff.Average score and rank: 4.777 (17th)___No. 3, 350 yards, par 4 (Flowering Peach): One of the best short par 4s in golf, this hole hasn’t been changed since 1982. Big hitters can drive near the green, and more are trying. But there are difficult short-game shots surrounding the L-shaped green that slopes sharply from right to left. Some players still hit iron off the tee to stay short of four bunkers on the left side.Masters memory: Scottie Scheffler’s three-shot lead was down to one in the final round of 2022 when he drove left and came up short. He chipped in for birdie and restored his lead to three shots when Cameron Smith made bogey. No one got closer the rest of the way.Average score and rank: 4.076 (14th)___No. 4, 240 yards, par 3 (Flowering Crab Apple): This usually is long iron or maybe fairway metal for shorter hitters. A deep bunker protects the right side of the green, with another bunker to the left. Club selection remains crucial because of the deceptive wind. The green slopes to the front. This hole features the only palm tree on the course.Masters memory: Phil Mickelson was one shot out of the lead in the final round in 2012 when his tee shot hit the grandstand and went into the woods. Lefty played two right-handed shots to get it out, hit his fourth into the bunker and got up-and-down for a triple bogey. He finished two shots behind.Average score and rank: 3.285 (3rd)___No. 5, 495 yards, par 4 (Magnolia): The Masters tee was moved back 40 yards in 2019. It now requires a 313-yard carry over the bunkers on the left of this uphill, slight dogleg to the left. The green slopes severely from back to front, and a small bunker catches anything long. If an approach is long and misses the bunker, it could roll down the slope and into the Magnolia trees. The back left green has been softened to allow for a pin position.Masters memory: Jack Nicklaus made two eagles in the 1995 Masters, with a 5-iron from 180 yards in the first round and with a 7-iron from 163 yards in the third round.Average score and rank: 4.265 (5th)___No. 6, 180 yards, par 3 (Juniper): An elevated tee to a large green with three tiers, with significant slopes marking the three levels. Getting close to the hole is a challenge. The easiest pin might be front left. The hole has not been changed since 1975.Masters memory: Billy Joe Patton, trying to become the first amateur to win the Masters, made a hole-in-one with a 5-iron from 190 yards in the final round in 1954. He missed the playoff between Ben Hogan and Sam Snead by one shot.Average score and rank: 3.137 (13th)___No. 7, 450 yards, par 4 (Pampas): This hole literally has come a long way, from 320 yards to 450 yards. The tee was extended by 45 yards in 2002, and then 40 yards in 2006. And then in 2009, the tee box was lengthened to allow the hole to play shorter if necessary. The tee shot is through a chute of Georgia pines, played to the left-center of the fairway into a slight slope. The green is surrounded by five bunkers, the most around any green.Masters memory: Byron Nelson drove the green in the 1937 Masters for a two-putt birdie when it played at 320 yards. That inspired Augusta National to alter the hole, moving the green back 20 yards and to the right on an upslope and surrounding the green with bunkers.Average score and rank: 4.156 (10th)___No. 8, 570 yards, par 5 (Yellow Jasmine): An accurate drive is important to avoid the fairway bunker on the right side. The hole is uphill and features trouble left of the green. There are no bunkers around the green, just severe mounding.Masters memory: Tom Kite and Seve Ballesteros were paired together in the final round in 1986, both in contention. Kite hit a sand wedge from 80 yards that bounced twice and dropped in for his first eagle to get within two shots of the lead. Ballesteros, not the least bit bothered, played a pitch-and-run from 40 yards short of the green and matched his eagle to take the lead.Average score and rank: 4.821 (15th)___No. 9, 460 yards, par 4 (Carolina Cherry): The tee shot should be aimed down the right side for a good angle into the green, which features two large bunkers to the left. Any approach that is short could spin some 25 yards back into the fairway.Masters memory: Jack Nicklaus hit 9-iron into 12 feet in 1986 and was ready to putt when he heard back-to-back cheers from behind him on the eighth green. “Why don’t we try to make some noise ourselves?” he said to the gallery. He made the birdie putt, and so began his charge to his sixth green jacket.Average score and rank: 4.139 (12th)___No. 10, 495 yards, par 4 (Camellia): A long hole that can play shorter if the drive catches the slope in the fairway. It is difficult to save par from the bunker right of the green. The putting surface slopes from right to left.Masters memory: Bubba Watson was deep in the trees to the right of the fairway, 155 yards away, when he played a 40-yard hook with a wedge that landed about 10 feet beneath the hole. He two-putted for par to win the 2012 Masters.Average score and rank: 4.301 (2nd)___No. 11, 510 yards, par 4 (White Dogwood): Amen Corner starts here. The tee was lengthened by 15 yards and to the left, the fairway was reshaped and several trees on the right side continue to be removed. A big tee shot — and a straight one — is required to get to the crest of the hill. A pond guards the green to the left and a bunker is to the back right. The safe shot is to bail out short and to the right, but it leaves a difficult pitch.Masters memory: Larry Mize was in a sudden-death playoff with Greg Norman in 1987 when he missed the green to the right. Mize’s 140-foot chip was gaining steam when it dropped in for birdie, giving him the green jacket and dealing another blow to Norman’s hopes of winning the Masters.Average score and rank: 4.303 (1st)___No. 12, 155 yards, par 3 (Golden Bell): This is among the most famous par 3s in golf and the shortest hole at Augusta National. Club selection can range from a 6-iron to a 9-iron, but it’s difficult to gauge the wind. Rae’s Creek is in front of the shallow green, with two bunkers behind it and one in front.Masters memory: Jordan Spieth hit two balls into Rae’s Creek and made a quadruple-bogey 7. He started the back nine Sunday in 2016 with a five-shot lead. Walking to the 13th tee, he was three shots behind.Average score and rank: 3.272 (4th)___No. 13, 545 yards, par 5 (Azalea): In a move long anticipated, the tee was moved back 35 yards. It still requires an accurate tee shot to the center of the fairway to set up players to go for the green, but they likely will be hitting at least a mid-iron. A tributary to Rae’s Creek winds in front of the green, and four bunkers are behind the putting surface. From tee to green, there are about 1,600 azaleas.Masters memory: With a two-shot lead in the final round in 2010, Phil Mickelson was in the pine straw behind a pair of trees . He hit 6-iron through a small gap in the pines and over the creek to about 4 feet. He missed the eagle putt but kept his lead and went on to win.Average score and rank: 4.775 (18th)___No. 14, 440 yards, par 4 (Chinese Fir): This is the only hole on the course without a bunker. Even if the drive avoids trees on both sides of the fairway, the green has severe contours that feed the ball to the right.Masters memory: Phil Mickelson holed out for eagle during an eagle-eagle-birdie stretch on Saturday in 2010 that helped him get into the final group. He won his third green jacket the next day.Average score and rank: 4.164 (8th)___No. 15, 550 yards, par 5 (Firethorn): The tees were moved back 20 yards in 2022 and the fairway recontoured. A cluster of pines is starting to mature on the right side of the fairway, making it critical to be straight off the tee. The green can be reached in two with a good drive, but a pond guards the front and there is a bunker to the right. Even for those laying up, the third shot requires a precise wedge from a downhill lie.Masters memory: Gene Sarazen was three shots behind when he hit the “shot heard 'round the world” in 1935. His 4-wood from 235 yards went into the hole for an albatross. He tied Craig Wood and defeated him the next day in a playoff.Average score and rank: 4.777 (16th)___No. 16, 170 yards, par 3 (Redbud): The hole is played entirely over water and eventually bends to the left. Two bunkers guard the right side, and the green slopes significantly from right to left. The Sunday pin typically is back and on the lower shelf, and pars from the top shelf that day are rare.Masters memory: Tiger Woods had a one-shot lead over Chris DiMarco when he missed the green long in 2005. He chipped away from the hole up the slope, watched it make a U-turn at the top and roll back toward the hole, pausing for 2 full seconds before dropping for birdie.Average score and rank: 3.141 (11th)___No. 17, 440 yards, par 4 (Nandina): The Eisenhower Tree to the left of the fairway about 210 yards from the tee could not be saved from an ice storm in February 2014. It was taken down after suffering significant damage. That has made the tee shot much easier, especially for those with a lower, left-to-right ball flight. The green is protected by two bunkers in the front.Masters memory: Jack Nicklaus made his final birdie in 1986 with a 12-foot putt that sent him to a 30 on the back nine and a 65, giving him a one-shot win and his sixth Masters. The pose Nicklaus struck when the putt dropped is captured in a bronze of him outside his clubhouse at Muirfield Village.Average score and rank: 4.160 (9th)___No. 18, 465 yards, par 4 (Holly): Now among the most demanding finishing holes in golf, this uphill dogleg right is protected off the tee by two deep bunkers at the left elbow — the only bunkers in play off the tee on the back nine (except for par 3s). Trees get in the way of a drive that strays to the right. Bunkers grab any shot to the left and right.Masters memory: Sandy Lyle was tied for the lead with Mark Calcavecchia in 1988 when he hit 1-iron in the first of two bunkers down the left side of the fairway. Not thinking he could get on the green, Lyle hit 7-iron over the tall lip and behind the flag, and it rolled back to 10 feet. He holed the putt for birdie to win.Average score and rank: 4.229 (7th).___More AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851880,"Gophers gear up for Frozen 4, with title drought at 20 years","MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The reminders of Minnesota's proud and rich hockey history are everywhere at the rink, big trophies and bigger names that have defined the Gophers for generations.One of the most driven and talented teams to take the ice for Minnesota in decades has hardly felt any pressure from playing for such a prestigious program.Motivation is more like it.“We look around and see the banners and see a lot of success and history,” senior defenseman Ryan Johnson said. “At the same time there’s five national championships. It’s a lot, but you see the last one was 20 years ago. So what’s going on? We know we have the talent every year to win it.""That just shows the competitiveness of the major college game, with only 60 schools fielding Division I men's teams. Thirteen of Minnesota's 40 appearances in the NCAA Tournament have come since 2003, when the Gophers won their second straight title and fifth all time. This is the fifth time they've reached the Frozen Four in those 20 years, too. The annual expectations exceed that, though.Some of Minnesota’s most bitter rivals are ahead on the all-time national championship list that’s led by Denver and Michigan with nine each. North Dakota has eight, and Wisconsin has six.“There’s obviously a lot of eyes on us and a lot of attention, but we just try to be more focused on what’s going on with us in the locker room versus all that noise outside,” Johnson said.The Gophers have caused quite a ruckus this season. They played in front of nine sellouts at 3M Arena at Mariucci, with an average crowd of 9,156 that's an increase of more than 20% from last season.The No. 1 overall seed in the tournament, Minnesota (28-9-1) cruised through the Fargo Regional by beating Canisius 9-2 and St. Cloud State 4-1 to make the Frozen Four for the 23rd time.The Gophers have two of the three Hobey Baker Memorial Award finalists in freshman Logan Cooley and sophomore Matthew Knies, with Cooley's 57 points ranking second in the country and his linemate Knies leading the nation with seven game-winning goals including three in overtime.The 26-player team the Gophers will take to Tampa, Florida, next week for the national semifinals will feature 14 NHL draft picks. They play fellow powerhouse Boston University on April 6, followed by the Quinnipiac-Michigan game. The winners advance to the championship on April 8.The Gophers got to the Frozen Four last season, too, but lost their first game to Minnesota State.“It's something you learn from, something you go to bed thinking about,” junior defenseman Brock Faber said. “We’re excited to hopefully play a lot better this time around.”If the Gophers get their sixth title, there's a good chance Cooley will be a big part of it.The third overall pick in the 2022 NHL draft by the Arizona Coyotes, Cooley has the most points for a Gophers freshman since Thomas Vanek (62) in 2002-03 on the most recent championship team. He's on a 15-game streak with at least one point, with 30 points over that span.“When he gets the puck, the whole rink, the other team, coaches, players and the fans, there’s a pause and everyone waits to see what’s going to happen,” coach Bob Motzko said.There are 20 natives of Minnesota on this team, including 16 players who grew up within 40 miles of the Minneapolis campus. Motzko, who was hired five years ago away from St. Cloud State, is one too. He was also an assistant coach on those Gophers teams that won NCAA titles in 2002 and 2003.“You don’t take the job,” Motzko said, “and not know the expectations at Minnesota.”___AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851881,Trump's legal worries extend far beyond charges in New York,"The hush money case in New York that has led to criminal charges against Donald Trump is just one of a number of investigations that could pose legal problems for the former president.Joe Tacopina, a lawyer for Trump, confirmed Thursday that he had been informed that the former president had been indicted on charges involving payments made during the 2016 campaign to silence claims of an extramarital sexual encounter. The specific charges were not immediately made public.Trump faces a string of other inquiries as he campaigns for another term in 2024, including a criminal investigation over top secret documents found at his Florida estate, a probe in Washington into his efforts to undo the results of the 2020 presidential election, and an investigation in Georgia looking into whether he and his allies illegally interfered in the state's 2020 election.Trump, a Republican, has denied any wrongdoing and says he is being targeted by Democrats trying to keep him from reclaiming the White House.Here’s a look at the probes underway in various states and venues:MAR-A-LAGOOf all the inquiries Trump faces, a Justice Department probe into the retention of top secret government documents at his Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, could present the most significant legal jeopardy, with investigators saying in court filings last year that they were examining potential violations of multiple felony statutes.As part of that inquiry, agents and prosecutors have spent months interviewing multiple people close to Trump, including an aide who was seen on surveillance video moving boxes of documents at the property, as they examine whether Trump or his representatives sought to obstruct the classified documents probe.Federal officials obtained a search warrant last year to search his home, convincing a Florida judge there was probable cause of criminal activity there, including the willful retention of national defense information – a statute that by itself carries a penalty of up to 10 years in prison.A grand jury in Washington has been hearing evidence in the investigation. Prosecutors last year granted limited immunity to one close Trump ally to secure his testimony and more recently were able to compel the testimony of a Trump lawyer said to have drafted a document stating that a diligent search for classified records had been conducted.Attorney General Merrick Garland in November named Jack Smith, a veteran war crimes prosecutor who previously led the Justice Department’s public integrity section, to serve as special counsel for the Mar-a-Lago investigation and key aspects of a separate probe into efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.2020 ELECTION AND CAPITOL RIOTSmith has also been leading a team investigating efforts by Trump and his allies to overturn the election that Trump falsely claimed was stolen.Federal prosecutors have been especially focused on a scheme by Trump allies to put forth a slate of fake presidential electors in key battleground states who falsely declared that Trump, not Democrat Joe Biden, had won the 2020 election. They have issued subpoenas to a number of state Republican Party chairs.Federal prosecutors have brought multiple Trump administration officials before that grand jury for questioning, including the former Trump White House counsel and a top aide to Vice President Mike Pence. A federal judge recently ruled that Pence would have to testify before the grand jury, though his team was still deciding Thursday whether to appeal.In a sign of the expanding nature of the investigation, election officials in multiple states whose results were disputed by Trump have received subpoenas asking for past communications with or involving Trump and his campaign aides.A House committee that investigated the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol has recommended that the Justice Department bring criminal charges against Trump and associates who helped him launch a wide-ranging pressure campaign to try to overturn his 2020 election loss.GEORGIAAfter his 2020 election loss, Trump called Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and urged him to “find 11,780 votes” — just enough to overtake Biden and overturn Trump's narrow loss in the state.That Jan. 2 phone call was part of a monthslong effort by a special grand jury in Atlanta investigating whether crimes were committed as part of the pressure campaign to overturn Trump's defeat.Among those questioned by the special grand jury were Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor and Trump lawyer; Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp.Prosecutors have advised Giuliani and Georgia Republicans who served as fake electors that they are at risk of being indicted. The fake electors signed a certificate asserting Trump had won the election and declaring themselves the state’s electors, even though Biden had won the state and Democratic electors had already been certified.Trump and his allies have denied wrongdoing, and he has repeatedly described his phone call to Raffensperger as “perfect.”It's up to Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, a Democrat, to decide whether to convene a regular grand jury and pursue criminal charges in the case. The foreperson on the special grand jury that investigated the case at Willis' request indicated publicly in February that the panel had recommended multiple indictments.NEW YORKNew York Attorney General Letitia James has sued Trump and the Trump Organization, alleging they misled banks and tax authorities about the value of assets including golf courses and skyscrapers to get loans and tax benefits.That lawsuit could lead to civil penalties against the company if James, a Democrat, prevails. She is seeking a $250 million fine and a ban on Trump doing business in New York. Manhattan prosecutors investigated the same alleged conduct but did not pursue criminal charges.A civil trial is scheduled in state court for October.In a separate civil case in federal court in New York, Trump has been accused of raping a former magazine columnist in a dressing room in the mid-1990s. That case is scheduled to go to trial on April 25.Trump has repeatedly insisted he never met the columnist, E.

(AP) — The nationwide battle over the places where transgender people may belong has flared at the University of Wyoming, where a lawsuit filed by seven sorority members challenges the induction of a transgender woman into their local chapter.The woman, identified only by the pseudonym “Terry Smith” in the lawsuit filed Monday in U.S. District Court in Cheyenne, made residents of the Kappa Kappa Gamma house uncomfortable in part by sitting on a common-area couch for hours and staring at them without talking, the lawsuit alleges.“One sorority member walked down the hall to take a shower, wearing only a towel. She felt an unsettling presence, turned, and saw Mr. Smith watching her silently,” the lawsuit alleges.The lawsuit against the national Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority, its national council president and Smith claims national sorority officials pressured the local chapter to violate sorority rules, including those for voting to induct new members.The lawsuit asks for a judge to declare Smith's sorority membership void and to award unspecified damages. The damages should reflect the local chapter's decline in financial stability and donations because of Smith's induction last fall, the lawsuit alleges.Like Smith, the seven women suing are anonymous, referred to in the lawsuit as Jane Does I-XII.Smith did not immediately return an email message Thursday seeking comment. She had no attorney listed in court records.The lawsuit “contains numerous false allegations,” but the sorority couldn’t comment in detail, Executive Director Kari Kittrell Poole said in an emailed statement. Kappa Kappa Gamma does not discriminate based on factors including gender identity, she added.Smith, 21, doesn't live among the 44 women currently residing in the Sorority Row house because of housing commitments elsewhere, according to the lawsuit that identifies Smith as male.Smith has spent much time at the sorority house, however, including for a slumber party she allegedly did not leave until two hours after promised. The next morning, Smith became “sexually aroused” while watching other pledges change their clothes, the lawsuit alleges.Smith, who identifies with female pronouns on Twitter, wears women's clothing “only occasionally,” has not undergone medical gender transition and identifies as male on a Washington State driver's license even though she legally could have identified on it as female or “X” gender, the lawsuit alleges.“An adult human male does not become a woman just because he tells others that he has a female ‘gender identity’ and behaves in what he believes to be a stereotypically female manner,” the lawsuit says.While inducting Smith, the sorority improperly relied not on official bylaws but a 2018 “Guide for Supporting Our LGBTQIA+ Members” that says Kappa Kappa Gamma is a “single-gender” organization that admits both “women” and “individuals who identify as women,"" the lawsuit alleges.The University of Wyoming campus in Laramie has a long history of wrangling with LGBTQ+ issues since the murder of gay freshman Matthew Shepard in 1998 heightened attention to them nationwide. Wyoming, along with South Carolina, is one of just two states that has not yet adopted a hate-crimes law since Shepard's murder.Republican Gov. Mark Gordon recently allowed a ban on transgender athletes in precollege interscholastic athletics to become law without his signature.",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851883,"Chelsea, Wolfsburg reach Women's Champions League semifinals","LONDON (AP) — Chelsea goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger saved two penalties to help Chelsea knock out title holder Lyon 4-3 in a shootout and reach the semifinals of the Women's Champions League after a suspenseful and hard-fought contest at Stamford Bridge on Thursday.It was a bad evening for French clubs as Paris Saint-Germain also exited the tournament with a 2-1 loss on aggregate against Wolfsburg.Chelsea was on the verge of elimination after Sara Dabritz gave the eight-time champions the lead in extra time with a left-footed shot after she connected with a cross from Ada Hegerberg.But the French team could not hold onto its advantage as it conceded a penalty deep in added time following contact between Lyon forward Vicki Becho on Lauren James on the left of the box.The penalty was awarded following a VAR check. After a long delay, Maren Mjelde took the kick and scored to force a shootout. Berger stopped Lyon captain Wendie Renard's effort and then parried away Lindsey Horan's shot, prompting huge celebrations from her teammates.The Blues will next take on Barcelona in a rematch of the 2021 final.Lyon headed to London trailing 1-0 from the first leg and waited until the 77th to level the tie when Vanessa Gilles beat Berger at the near post.Two-time champion Wolfsburg made it to the last four for the second year in a row. After the German team won 1-0 at the Parc des Princes last week, Alexandra Popp's goal in the 20th minute proved decisive in front of 14,367 fans at the VW Arena despite Kadidiatou Diani's equalizer 10 minutes later for PSG.Wolfsburg hit the woodwork three times.""We are mega happy and mega proud, it was a tough fight,” Popp told broadcaster DAZN. “We fought our way in, took the duels. The first goal was extremely important for us.”Unbeaten in eight Champions League matches this season, Wolfsburg will face Arsenal in April's semifinals after the London club advanced Wednesday by beating Bayern Munich 2-0 at Emirates Stadium to overturn a 1-0 deficit from the first leg.Popp put Wolfsburg in the driver's seat with a superb strike into the far corner. PSG pushed hard for an equalizer and deservedly got it when Diani headed home a cross past goalkeeper Merle Frohms.PSG's hopes of progressing took a blow when Diani was forced off just before the break with a shoulder injury.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851884,Aaron Judge homers in 1st swing as New York Yankees captain,"NEW YORK (AP) — Aaron Judge's first swing of the season ended up just like 62 others last year: a soaring home run.In his first game as Yankees captain, Judge's solo drive in the first inning off Logan Webb started New York to a 5-0 opening-day win over the San Francisco Giants on Thursday.“One of my lowest, darkest places this winter was when I thought maybe it was in jeopardy that he was coming back,” Yankees manager Aaron Boone said Thursday morning. “One of the darkest places I went was picturing him on that third-base line in a Giants uniform on opening day.”Instead, Judge emerged from the first-base dugout to loud cheers from the crowd of 46,172 during pregame introductions. A short while later, he hit a 422-foot shot into the netting above Monument Park in center field, the first home run of the major league season.“I think it went back to the Roll Call and even the introductions — hearing my name, with the Yankee roar,” Judge said. “I didn’t want to go anywhere. I was pretty vocal about that from the beginning and then you got to go through the free-agency process. But all in all this is where I wanted to be and I’m happy I’m here and it’s tough to think about being anywhere else.”Just before opening day last year, Judge turned down the Yankees’ offer of $213.5 million over seven years through 2029, betting on himself.“I just remember the talk: How do you think he'll be? Do you think he'll be able to handle it? Will it be a distraction for him?” Boone said. “I think in hindsight it's safe to assume it was not.”Judge hit .311 with 62 homers and 131 RBIs en route to the AL MVP award. He broke the AL home record that had stood since Roger Maris hit 61 in 1961 and tied for the major league RBIs lead.Judge agreed to a $360 million, nine-year contract with the Yankees, spurning his hometown area Giants and the San Diego Padres. After Judge agreed to the deal, the Yankees elevated him to their first captain since Derek Jeter in 2014.Judge took a first-pitch strike from Webb on a sunny, 39-degree day at Yankee Stadium, then hit a thigh-high cutter on the outside part of the plate for a 109 mph drive and his first opening day home run.“It was a tone-setter for us,” winner Gerrit Cole said. “He came up and woke everybody up and showed us that he was here to play.”Judge added a broken-bat RBI single against John Brebbia in a two-run seventh and is hitting .429 (12 for 28) on opening day with four doubles and three walks.“It would have been nice to have him,” Webb said. ""I wish I could have that pitch back.”Judge turns 31 next month and craves adding the accomplishments expected in the lineage of Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio, Yogi Berra, Mickey Mantle and Jeter: World Series titles. He was playing in Yankee Stadium for the first time since Houston completed a four-game AL Championship Series sweep last October and went on to beat Philadelphia for the championship.“There's only room for improvement,” Judge said. “I'm trying to get 1% better every day, and hopefully I can add that up over a course of nine years and have some impactful years here with the Yankees.”___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851885,Funerals set for Nashville school shooting's 6 victims,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Funeral arrangements were disclosed Thursday for the six people killed in this week's school shooting in Nashville, as the grieving city mourns the victims of the horrific attack that transformed what should have been a normal day of school on a bright, sunny morning into wrenching tragedy.Heartbreaking new details continued to emerge about the lives of the three adults and three 9-year-old students who police say were killed during the shooting Monday at The Covenant School. The children have been identified as Evelyn Dieckhaus, Hallie Scruggs and William Kinney. Also killed were Katherine Koonce, 60, the head of the school; Mike Hill, 61, a custodian; and Cynthia Peak, 61, a substitute teacher.A funeral service for Evelyn was scheduled for Friday at Woodmont Christian Church in Nashville, with a private reception to follow, according to an obituary provided to The Associated Press by a family friend. Funeral guests are invited to wear pink or other joyful colors “in tribute to Evelyn’s light and love of color,” according the obituary. She will be laid to rest on Saturday in a private family burial.Hallie's family planned a private funeral for her Saturday at Covenant Presbyterian Church, where her father is the lead pastor. On Thursday, members of Our Lady of the Lake Catholic Church, including the girl’s grandparents, were planning to pray the rosary for Hallie and for all those affected by the shooting, according to a Facebook post from the church.The funeral for Hill has been set for Tuesday morning at 11 a.m. at Stephens Valley Church in Nashville, with visitation beginning at 10 a.m., pastor Jim Bachmann said.A visitation for Koonce was scheduled for Tuesday from 5-8 p.m. at Christ Presbyterian Church, with a service the following day at 1 p.m.The service for Kinney was set for 2:30 p.m. Sunday at Christ Presbyterian.Peak's visitation was scheduled for Saturday at 10:30 a.m., also at Christ Presbyterian, with a service at noon.The funeral plans were announced as new information about Evelyn and some of the others was released.In the obituary given to the AP by a family friend, Evelyn was described as “a constant beacon of joy” who loved art, music, animals and snuggling with her older sister on the couch.“With an unwavering faith in the goodness of others, Evelyn made people feel known, seen, but never judged,” the obituary said. “Her adoring family members agree that ‘she was everyone’s safe space.’”In preschool, Evelyn “would often position herself between two younger babies, intuitively offering comfort by patting their backs.” She would greet people with open arms and an infectious laugh, the obituary said.Evelyn enjoyed crafting and drawing, and her teachers “would observe Evelyn studying the world around her with curiosity, eagerness, and clarity,” according to the obituary.She also liked to sing along to tunes by Taylor Swift and from the Broadway show “Hamilton.” She also loved her dogs, Mable and Birdie, and wanted a rat for her 10th birthday present.“Strong but never pushy, she had self-composure and poise beyond her years,” the obituary said. “This girl ‘could read a room.’”As Evelyn's loved ones prepared for her funeral, William Kinney's youth baseball league was taking steps to remember a teammate and friend.The night after the shooting, a coach at the Crieve Hall Baseball park led a prayer and a moment of silence for the boy. The tribute was posted on the park's Facebook page.William had played baseball at the park in the past and his team this season was the Reds, said Steve Cherrico, director of Crieve Hall youth athletics. Players and their families have been encouraged to wear red in the field and in the stands, and red ribbons have been placed at the field where William played.“We've covered everything in red,” Cherrico said. “We have put plenty of memory pieces on the ballpark itself.""Cherrico said league members were heartbroken at the loss of William and the others who were killed. Cherrico said it was not the first time that Crieve Hall has lost a player.“The league has always stepped up and come together as a family,” he said.In response to the park’s tribute, Major League Baseball’s Cincinnati Reds posted the following on Instagram: ”“Sending all of our love from Cincinnati,” with a heart emoji at the end.___Loller reported from Nashville; Sainz reported from Memphis, Tennessee; Ben Finley contributed to this report from Norfolk, Virginia.",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851886,Upset-rich March Madness causes mixed results at sportsbooks,"LAS VEGAS (AP) — A bettor in December placed $500 on Florida Atlantic at 400-1 odds to make the Final Four, costing Westgate Las Vegas $200,000.That was a clear win for one bettor, but who actually has come out between the sportsbooks and those on the other side of the counter during this most unusual NCAA Tournament is much more murky.While Westgate absorbed a tough loss, Red Rock Resort in Las Vegas came out in decent shape even as upsets ruled the first two weeks of March Madness and set up a Final Four that begins Saturday with UConn at No. 4 as the highest seed.“We’re still in really good shape on, especially, San Diego State and Florida Atlantic,” said Chuck Esposito, Red Rock race and sportsbook director. “I’ve heard that there there are some places that have some liability with Florida Atlantic, but we don’t. We do still do well on UConn and Miami. Both those schools seem to be the the kind of two schools that are getting some future play. But, overall, we’re pretty good shape with all four teams.”A UConn victory likely would be the best outcome for sportsbooks, and the Huskies have rolled through the NCAA Tournament, winning by an average of 22.5 points.Their odds before the tournament at Westgate were 20-1 to win the championship. As for the rest of the field, Miami was at 50-1, San Diego State at 60-1 and FAU at 100-1.“It doesn't look like a Final Four,” said Jay Kornegay, Westgate vice president of race and sports operations. “It looks like an NIT final.”Kornegay said he could see the FAU run to the Final Four coming, but there was little Westgate could to do mitigate the damage.As for future NCAA Tournaments, Kornegay said discussions already are under way about lowering the odds for the long shots and increasing them for the favorites. It will be among many tweaks as more parity hits college basketball, in part because of the transfer portal.“Believe me, we’re keeping an eye on it,” Kornegay said. “We’re not going to make a knee-jerk, dramatic change. ... I do believe there are going to be more Cinderella stories than we’ve seen in the past.”Esposito said even more work will go into breaking down rosters in the future, making special note of schools with veteran players.“I think you’re going to continue to see the trend of numbers a lot tighter, a lot smaller,” Esposito said. “I do think David has more of a chance against Goliath than he ever has before.”Esposito and Kornegay said the women's NCAA Tournament and Final Four, which begins Friday, have drawn more betting interest than in past years, though still nowhere close to the level for the men. But both sportsbooks are offering more betting options for the women's Final Four to reflect the increased interest.While the men's Final Four is a major surprise, the women's side includes undefeated South Carolina and Iowa star and AP Player of the Year Caitlin Clark.“It's not leaps and bounds more,” Kornegay said. “We've seen increases that are noticeable on the women's side.”The men have a near monopoly on betting during the regular season, though more women's games have been made available. Louisville coach Jeff Walz said he would like to see all women's games on the betting boards.“I just think for women’s basketball there’s more interest now for the casual fan,"" Walz said. “Obviously, we can’t bet on it or anything like that ... but if you’re asking what can enhance our game, that little thing right there I think has already.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851887,San Diego County supervisor to resign after assault lawsuit,"SAN DIEGO (AP) — The chair of San Diego County’s board of supervisors said he will resign amid accusations that he sexually assaulted a government employee, completing a swift and shocking fall for a decorated Marine combat veteran whose star rose with his Democratic Party’s ascendancy in the nation’s eighth-largest city. Nathan Fletcher, who defected from the Republican Party in 2012, was elected to a second term with 65% of the vote in November, two years after Democrats won a board majority that eluded their grasp for decades. Fletcher, 46, was the face of the San Diego region’s muscular response to COVID-19 at daily news conferences. He became half of San Diego’s most powerful political couple after his 2017 marriage to Lorena Gonzalez Fletcher, a well-known liberal Democratic state assemblywoman who became a top California labor leader last year. Fletcher’s progressive positions and telegenic presence made him a solid favorite to succeed another prominent California politician, Toni Atkins, in the state Senate. But he announced late Sunday that he was dropping his bid after less than two months to seek treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder and alcohol abuse. Days later, Fletcher resigned as chair of the San Diego Metropolitan Transit System after a former television reporter who worked in the agency’s public relations office alleged sexual harassment and assault in a lawsuit that included screenshots of lurid messages from Fletcher. Hours after that, Fletcher said he would resign from the county board of supervisors, calling the pressure on his family over the last week “immense and unbearable.” “A combination of my personal mistakes plus false accusations has created a burden that my family shouldn’t have to bear,” he said. He will leave office May 15. Fletcher’s fall jolted the city a week after officials made a critical turn in a saga that has captivated the city and threatened other top politicians.A 2017 lease-to-own deal for employees to occupy a 19-story downtown office building turned disastrous after asbestos and other deficiencies were discovered and rendered the space uninhabitable. Jason Hughes, an unpaid adviser to the city on the deal, pleaded guilty last week to a misdemeanor and agreed to repay $9.4 million that he collected in a dual role as adviser to the building’s seller, Cisterra LLC.The deal was bungled under Mayor Kevin Faulconer, one of California’s most promising Republican leaders until a resounding defeat in a failed 2020 recall effort against Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat.Brian Adams, a political science professor at San Diego State University, likened Fletcher to other fallen leaders, including Andrew Cuomo and Eliot Spitzer, both former governors of New York, and former U.S. Sen. John Edwards.“They were all seen having promising futures collapse over sexual harassment claims,” said Adams.Fletcher's name entered conversations about who San Diego might elect mayor or member of Congress, Adams said. His troubles may open the way for new faces if Todd Gloria, the Democratic mayor, faces questions over how he handled fallout from the real estate debacle.San Diego’s political drama doesn’t appear to have gripped residents like earlier scandal, including the resignation in 2013 of Bob Filner, the first Democratic mayor in 20 years, after weeks of near-daily allegations of harassing women, including city employees.A Republican mayor, Dick Murphy, resigned in 2004 after a pension crisis made San Diego a poster child for financial mismanagement.In a lawsuit filed Tuesday in San Diego Superior Court, Grecia Figueroa, 34, says she began exchanging messages with Fletcher in 2021 when he started visiting her social media accounts. He once wrote, “Home alone — no wife and kids.” He urged her to delete his texts and be discreet.Figueroa says Fletcher kissed her in the stairway of a hotel where he was staying in May 2022. Weeks later, he allegedly texted her during a meeting that he had five minutes and asked her to go to an adjacent conference room, where he kissed and grabbed her.Figueroa was fired Feb. 6 after she “attempted to engage in meaningful, pre-litigation discussions with Fletcher to resolve her claims quietly and amicably,” her lawsuit says. On Sunday — just before Fletcher ended his Senate run — Fletcher’s attorney threatened to sue Figueroa for extortion, she said.Fletcher acknowledged “consensual interactions” with someone outside his marriage. “I haven’t done the things that are alleged but I did violate the basic trust of my marriage and set a terrible example for our children,” he said in a statement. San Diego County Democratic Party Chair Becca Taylor said Thursday that Fletcher’s decision to resign was appropriate, echoing other political leaders. Gonzalez Fletcher, executive secretary-treasurer of the California Labor Federation, said she loves her husband and believes “his name will be cleared"" but that she urged him to resign.",2023/03/31,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851891,France: Macron touts water plan in Alps amid pension unrest,"French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday laid out plans to tackle water crisis, briefly escaping daily protests against pension reform plans that have roiled the country for weeks.This was Macron's first major policy announcement and public outing after anger over his decision to force through a controversial pension reform plan saw violent clashes between protesters and police last week.Macron said he went ahead with the trip becuase the largely urban protests should not derail his efforts to govern more generallly.""There are protests, but it does not mean everything must stop,"" Macron said. ""We need to continue working.""However, Macron was greeted in the Alpine village of Savines-Le-Lac by groups of protesters with placards like ""Macron resign!"" and ""Take your pension, not ours.""Macron delivered the plan in Savines-Le-Lac in the Hautes Alpes region of southeast France that has suffered acute water shortages. The town is also located on the edge of Serre-Poncon lake, one of Western Europe's largest man-made reservoirs.The water-saving plan includes an array of measures, from fixing leaking pipes to adapting the way farmers and the nuclear power industry use water, and to make water more expensive for people who are using more than they should need on a daily basis.""In the face of change, there are necessary constraints, we must explain them, share them and make everyone aware of their responsibilites,"" Macron said.Like much of Europe, France suffered a severe drought last summer amid hot and dry weather. It deprived more than 100 municipalities of water to a point they were not able to deliver drinking water to the tap.The water shortages also exacerbated maintenance-related problems with the country's network of nuclear power plants, with some sites having insufficient available water for cooling, all around the height of rising energy prices linked in large part to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.France has since recorded its driest winter in decades as well. Macron had earlier this month promised his government would devise an urgent ""water plan "" in March given the winter drought conditions.""We have decided to launch 1,000 projects in five years to recycle and reuse water,"" he said. ""We want to reuse 300 million cubic meters, or… 3,500 bottles of water per French person per year."" France currently reuses less than 1% of its water.Climate change would deprive France of 30% to 40% of available water by 2050, Macron said. He laid out around 50 measures to save water, including announcing a gradual price increase for use of water for ""comfort"" so citizens use water judiciously.Major sectors, from nuclear energy to industry, would have to adapt and improve water management.France recorded 32 days without rain this winter —  the longest such winter drought since record-keeping began in 1959.Snow levels in the French Alps, the Pyrenees and other French mountain ranges were also much lower than usual for this time of the year, according to the national weather service.Weather watchers were worried about depleted water supplies since snowmelt is crucial to filling rivers and reservoirs.rm/msh (Reuters, AP)",2023/03/30,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851893,Who’s who in the Manhattan DA’s Donald Trump indictment,"As Donald Trump fought his way to victory in the 2016 presidential campaign, key allies tried to smooth his bumpy path by paying off two women who had been thinking of going public with allegations of extramarital encounters with the Republican.The payoffs, and the way that Trump's company accounted for one of them, are believed to be at the center of a grand jury investigation that led to a criminal indictment and could result in the first-ever criminal prosecution of a former U.S. president.Here's a look at key figures in the case:STORMY DANIELSA porn actor who’s also had bit parts in mainstream films like “The 40-Year-Old Virgin” and “Knocked Up,” Daniels was paid $130,000 to keep quiet about what she says was an awkward and unexpected sexual encounter with Trump at a celebrity golf outing in Lake Tahoe in 2006. Trump denies having sex with Daniels.Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, was paid the money in the final weeks of Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign after her representative said she was willing to make on-the-record statements to the National Enquirer or on television confirming a sexual encounter with Trump.Daniels attempted to capitalize on her newfound notoriety after news of the payment became public, embarking on a nationwide strip club tour in 2018. During a stop in Columbus, Ohio, Daniels was arrested on suspicion of inappropriately touching an undercover officer, but the charges were dropped hours later.Her former lawyer, Michael Avenatti, is serving 11 years in prison for extortion and fraud, including a conviction for stealing $297,000 in proceeds from Daniels’ 2018 book, “Full Disclosure.”KAREN MCDOUGALA former Playboy model who said she had a 10-month affair with Trump in the mid-2000s, McDougal was paid $150,000 in 2016 by the parent company of the National Enquirer for the rights to her story about the alleged relationship. Trump denies any affair.The story never ran. The company suppressed McDougal’s story until after the election, a dubious journalism practice known as “catch and kill.” American Media Inc. has acknowledged that its payments to McDougal were done specifically to assist Trump’s election bid and were made “in concert” with his campaign.McDougal has said Trump tried to pay her after their first sexual tryst at a bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel in 2006. McDougal said she continued the relationship with Trump for about 10 months and broke it off in April 2007 because she felt guilty.MICHAEL COHENA lawyer by training, Cohen worked for the Trump Organization from 2006 to 2017, serving as Trump's fixer. He once proudly proclaimed he’d “take a bullet” for his boss.Cohen took the lead in arranging the payment to Daniels, passing it through a corporation he established for the purpose. He says he was then reimbursed by Trump, whose company logged the payment and related bonuses as “legal expenses.”A few months earlier, Cohen had also arranged for the publisher of the National Enquirer to make the similar $150,00 payment to McDougal for the rights to her story about an alleged affair with Trump.Cohen made recordings of a conversation in which he and Trump spoke about the arrangement to pay McDougal through the tabloid publisher. At one point, Trump said: “What do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?” Trump denies the affair.After Trump became president, Cohen held himself out as someone who could potentially advise corporate clients on the new administration, collecting hefty fees from companies seeking influence in the new White House.Federal prosecutors in 2018 charged Cohen with evading taxes related to his investments in the taxi industry, with lying to Congress and with campaign finance violations related to the hush money payments.Cohen, who blamed Trump for his legal problems, pleaded guilty and served about a year in prison before being released to home confinement because of the COVID-19 pandemic. He is now a key prosecution witness in the Manhattan district attorney’s investigation.ALLEN WEISSELBERGThe longtime chief financial officer at the Trump Organization, Weisselberg made key decisions in how the company kept its books, but did not appear to be cooperating with the hush-money investigation.During testimony before Congress in 2019, Cohen said it was Weisselberg who decided how to structure his reimbursement for the payment to Daniels. Cohen said Weisselberg paid the money out over 12 months “so that it would look like a retainer.”Federal prosecutors gave Weisselberg limited immunity from prosecution in exchange for his grand jury testimony in their investigation of the payments. But the Manhattan district attorney's office ultimately brought unrelated charges against Weisselberg for dodging income taxes on job perks he got from Trump's company, including a rent-free apartment and a luxury car.He pleaded guilty and is serving a short jail term set to expire in April.DAVID PECKERThe National Enquirer’s former publisher and a longtime Trump friend, Pecker testified twice before the grand jury about the tabloid's involvement in suppressing negative stories about Trump.Pecker met with Cohen during Trump’s 2016 campaign and said the Enquirer's parent company would help buy and bury potentially damaging stories about Trump’s relationship with women.Pecker, who was the Enquirer's chairman and chief executive at the time, agreed to keep Cohen apprised of any such stories. In June 2016, he alerted Cohen that McDougal's lawyer had approached the publication seeking to sell her story about an alleged affair with Trump.The Enquirer’s owner at the time, American Media Inc., then agreed to pay McDougal for “limited life rights” to the story of her relationship with “any then-married man.” The publisher said it would feature her on two magazine covers and print more than 100 of her articles in exchange for $150,000.Cohen signed an agreement to buy the nondisclosure part of McDougal’s contract for $125,000 through a company he formed, but Pecker later called off the deal and told Cohen to tear up the agreement.Federal prosecutors agreed in 2018 not to prosecute American Media in exchange for its cooperation in the campaign finance investigation that led to Cohen’s guilty plea and prison sentence. The Federal Election Commission fined the company $187,500, deeming the McDougal deal as a ""prohibited corporate in-kind contribution.”Pecker stepped down as CEO of the publisher in 2020.ALVIN BRAGGManhattan’s first Black district attorney, Bragg could become the first prosecutor anywhere to bring a criminal case against a former U.S. president. The Democrat inherited an investigation of Trump when he took office in January 2022.Bragg grew up in Harlem during the 1980s crack cocaine epidemic, where he says he was held at gunpoint six times — three times by police. A graduate of Harvard Law School, he previously worked as a federal prosecutor, chief deputy state attorney general, civil rights lawyer and law school professor.Bragg campaigned for office as a progressive reformer. He was elected with 83% of the vote in deep-blue Manhattan.After taking office, Bragg paused an investigation into Trump's business dealings that had been seen as gathering momentum toward a possible indictment. But after his prosecutors won a trial last year in which Trump’s company, the Trump Organization, was convicted of tax fraud, Bragg convened a new grand jury to examine the hush money payouts.JOSEPH TACOPINAA Brooklyn-born lawyer known for his sharp suits and celebrity clientele, Tacopina is the public face of Trump’s defense team.Trump is just the latest big name to turn to Tacopina, whose past clients have included the rappers Meek Mill, Jay-Z and A$AP Rocky and baseball great Alex Rodriguez.In recent weeks Tacopina has been making the former president’s case on TV news shows, questioning Bragg’s investigation and motives, challenging Cohen’s credibility as a star witness and suggesting Trump was extorted.It wasn’t always like that. In a TV appearance in 2018, long before Tacopina started representing Trump, he told CNN that the payment to Daniels appeared to be “illegal” and a “potential campaign finance issue.” He told the network that claims Trump wasn’t aware of the payment didn't ""pass the straight-face test.”Trump hired Tacopina in January, initially to defend him against a civil lawsuit brought by magazine columnist E. Jean Carroll, who says Trump raped her in the mid-1990s. That case is scheduled to go to trial next month.Tacopina played ice hockey in college and later dabbled as a player agent. He owns S.P.A.L., a team in the second tier of Italian soccer.SUSAN NECHELESNecheles is a New York City defense lawyer who represented Trump’s company at its tax fraud trial last year and has been working behind-the-scenes on the former president’s criminal defense, meeting with prosecutors in an attempt to head off potential charges.In the past she served as counsel to the late Genovese crime family underboss Venero Mangano, known as Benny Eggs, and defended John Gotti’s lawyer, Bruce Cutler, in a contempt-of-court case in the early 1990s. In recent years, the Yale Law School graduate has represented liquor heiress Clare Bronfman in the NXIVM cult case.Like Tacopina, Necheles is a former Brooklyn prosecutor.During the Trump Organization trial, she made a point of referring to Trump as “President Trump.”“This is not a political statement,"" she explained to jurors. “My parents were immigrants and migrants,” she continued. “And in my home we referred to all former presidents as presidents out of respect for the office, whether we supported him, or disagreed with him.”MATTHEW COLANGELOBragg hired Colangelo in December to lead the investigation. They previously worked together on Trump-related matters as senior officials at the office of New York Attorney General Letitia James.During his tenure with the attorney general's office, Colangelo worked on a lawsuit that resulted in the closure of Trump’s charitable foundation for misusing funds. He was also part of a wave of state litigation against Trump administration policies, resulting in dozens of lawsuits that challenged everything from diluted environmental standards to changes to U.S. mail service ahead of the 2020 election.After President Joe Biden took office, Colangelo joined the U.S. Justice Department and was temporarily its third in command. He then became a principal deputy to Associate U.S. Attorney General Vanita Gupta. Previously, Colangelo served as deputy assistant to President Barack Obama, was a deputy director of the National Economic Council and a chief of staff for the U.S. labor secretary.JUAN MANUEL MERCHANA respected jurist and former prosecutor, Merchan is the judge in Trump’s criminal case — the latest in a string of Trump-related cases he’s presided over.Merchan, an acting justice in the criminal division of New York’s trial court, was the judge in the Trump Organization’s tax fraud trial last year and a related case against the company’s longtime finance chief, Allen Weisselberg.Merchan, 60, is the supervising judge of the grand jury that indicted Trump and is presiding over a border wall fraud case against longtime Trump ally Steve Bannon. He is also the judge of Manhattan’s mental health court.Merchan steered the negotiations that led to Weisselberg’s guilty plea last summer, which called for him to testify against the Trump Organization in exchange for a five-month jail sentence.During the company’s trial, Merchan was calm and considered but irked the defense with some rulings they felt were favorable to the prosecution.Merchan, a graduate of Hofstra law school, worked in the trial and investigations divisions of the Manhattan district attorney’s office in the 1990s and held various roles in the state attorney general’s office before being appointed to the bench in 2006.Merchan started as a family court judge in the Bronx. In 2009, he was appointed to the court of claims, which deals with lawsuits against the state, and assigned to his current role, as an acting justice in the trial court, which in New York is known as Supreme Court. He is not elected to the post.",2023/04/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851894,"Among 160 years of presidential scandals, Trump stands alone","Though far from the only U.S. president dogged by legal and ethical scandals, Donald Trump now occupies a unique place in history as the first indicted on criminal charges.Two others, like Trump, found themselves impeached by Congress — Bill Clinton for lying under oath about his affair with a White House intern, and Andrew Johnson for pushing the limits of his executive authority in a bitter power struggle following the Civil War.Richard Nixon resigned in disgrace over his role in the infamous Watergate break-in. And Ronald Reagan and Ulysses S. Grant both became forever tied to scandals in which close aides got prosecuted, though neither president was ever charged.Here’s a look at how Trump’s predecessors fared:BILL CLINTONClinton spent more than half his presidency under scrutiny in investigations that ranged from failed real estate deals to the Democratic president’s affair with a White House intern.Investigators took a lengthy look into Bill and Hillary Clinton’s investments in the troubled Whitewater real estate venture. Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, appointed to oversee the investigation in 1994, turned up no evidence of wrongdoing by the Clintons. But two of their close associates, Jim and Susan McDougal, ended up convicted of Whitewater-related charges. So did Jim Guy Tucker, Clinton’s successor as governor of Arkansas.Starr’s 1998 report packed with lurid details of Clinton’s affair with intern Monica Lewinsky proved far more damaging. While being questioned in a sexual harassment lawsuit filed by former Arkansas state employee Paula Jones, Clinton had denied having “sexual relations” with Lewinsky.Starr concluded that Clinton had lied under oath and obstructed justice. That led to the House voting to impeach Clinton on Dec. 19, 1998. He was acquitted by the Senate, allowing him to remain in office until his term ended in January 2001.RONALD REAGANReagan never faced impeachment or court charges for the biggest scandal of his presidency. But the arms-for-hostages scheme that became known as the Iran-Contra affair dogged him long after he left the White House.In 1986, during Reagan’s second term, the public learned that his administration had authorized secret arms sales to Iran while seeking Iranian aid in freeing American hostages held in Lebanon. As much as $30 million from the arms sales was diverted, in violation of U.S. law, to aid rebels fighting the leftist government of Nicaragua.Reagan’s national security adviser, John Poindexter, resigned and an aide, Lt. Col. Oliver North, was fired. Both were also convicted of crimes stemming from efforts to deceive and obstruct Congress. Their convictions were later overturned. President George H.W. Bush, Reagan’s successor, pardoned six others involved.Reagan insisted money from the arms sales was funneled to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels without his knowledge.RICHARD NIXONNixon resigned from office in August 1974 rather than face impeachment for his administration’s cover-up of its involvement in a break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington.The bungled burglary at the Watergate office building resulted in the indictment of seven men, including two former White House aides. Five of the Watergate defendants pleaded guilty; two were convicted in criminal trials.Intrigue over the 1972 Watergate break-in didn’t stop Nixon from cruising to reelection a few months later. He endured the storm until the House Judiciary Committee in 1974 approved three articles of impeachment accusing him of obstruction of justice, abuse of power and contempt of Congress.Before the full House could vote, a bombshell tape recording was released in which Nixon could be heard approving a plan to pressure the FBI to drop its Watergate investigation. Nixon resigned after losing support from key congressional Republicans.His vice president, Gerald Ford, became president and pardoned Nixon a month later.ULYSSES S. GRANTWhile never personally charged with crimes or formally accused of wrongdoing, Grant as president torpedoed a corruption case prosecuted by his own administration. The man on trial was Grant’s personal secretary in the White House.In 1875, an investigation launched by Treasury Secretary Benjamin H. Bristow resulted in hundreds of arrests in a scheme known as the Whiskey Ring, in which distillers, revenue agents and fellow conspirators diverted millions of dollars in liquor taxes to themselves.The Civil War general-turned-president found himself at odds with the crackdown when Gen. Orville E. Babcock ended up charged as a conspirator. Not only was Babcock the president’s personal secretary, but he and Grant had also been friends since the war.Prosecutors said they had uncovered telegrams Babcock sent to ringleaders to assist their scheme. Regardless, Grant insisted on testifying in his aide’s defense.To avoid the spectacle of the president appearing at Babcock’s trial, attorneys questioned Grant under oath at the White House on Feb. 12, 1876. A transcript of his testimony was later read in court in St. Louis. The jury acquitted Babcock, a decision largely credited to Grant’s unwavering defense.ANDREW JOHNSONThe first American president to have his legacy tarnished by impeachment, Andrew Johnson’s woes arose from his intense feuding with Congress over Reconstruction following the Civil War.The Tennessee Democrat had been elected vice president in 1864 as part of a unity ticket with Abraham Lincoln, and Johnson assumed the presidency after Lincoln’s 1865 assassination. From the White House, Johnson called for pardoning Confederate leaders and opposed extending voting rights to freed Blacks, infuriating congressional Republicans.It was Johnson’s firing of Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, a Lincoln appointee who favored tougher policies toward the defeated South, that prompted the House to pass articles of impeachment that accused the president of ousting and replacing Stanton illegally.Johnson’s impeachment trial began in the Senate on March 5, 1868. It ended more than two months later, with senators just one vote short of removing Johnson from office. He served the remainder of his final year, but fellow Democrats denied him their nomination to run again.",2023/03/31,,World

Gleyber Torres added a two-run, opposite-field homer to right in the fourth and Judge blooped an RBI broken-bat single in a two-run seventh that included DJ LeMahieu’s run-scoring single.Volpe grew up a Yankees fan in Manhattan and his family moved to New Jersey when he was in the fourth grade. He attended Delbarton School in Morristown, New Jersey, and was selected by the Yankees with the 30th overall pick in the 2019 amateur draft.He earned the shortstop job during spring training after just 22 games of Triple-A experience. The decibel level increased markedly when he was introduced before the game and again when Volpe came to the plate for the first time leading off the third inning.“I almost felt like he was chasing 62 there for his first at-bat, the way the crowd was,” Judge said.In his new role of Yankees captain, Judge gave Volpe some advice Wednesday while they were together in the clubhouse.“I was kind of ragging him a little bit,” Judge recalled. “I said, ‘Man, I know you’re a big Yankee fan, but you got to have something special for those Bleacher Creatures.’”That's when Volpe came up with the crest kiss.“I kind of just thought of it on the spot, just ‘cause I remember he did it last year,” Volpe said. “He gave me the thumbs-up, so I knew that's what I had to do.”Volpe stayed in Manhattan on Wednesday night, got to the stadium about 8:45 a.m. and took photos of the ballpark exterior with his phone that he shared with his parents. About 60 family members attended the game.He walked, grounded out and struck out. Volpe made a fine defensive play in the fourth, coming in to field Thairo Estrada’s three-hopper, and he started a double play on Wilmer Flores’ sixth-inning grounder.Volpe switched from from No. 77 to No. 11 after calling former Yankees outfielder Brett Gardner and asking for permission to take the number, last used by Gardner in 2021.“His impact on the clubhouse to this day is ginormous,” Volpe said. “Obviously we have leaders in the clubhouse but I think he played a huge role in making those players leaders and taking them under their wing the same way those guys are now taking me under their wing.”K CORNERLogan Webb (0-1) set a Giants opener strikeout record with 12, one more than Madison Bumgarner in 2017.Cole broke the Yankees opener strikeout mark of nine by Tim Leary in 1991. Among those he fanned was his brother-in-law, Brandon Crawford.Cole and Webb joined Dave McNally and Sam McDowell in 1970, and Max Scherzer and Jacob deGrom in 2019 as the only opposing starters with double-digit strikeouts in an opener since 1901.Wandy Peralta, Jonathan Loáisiga and Ron Marinaccio finshed a four-hitter for the Yankees first opening-day shutout win since 1988.SPEEDING ALONGOn the first day of the pitch clock, there was just one violation, on J.D. Davis at the plate in the ninth. The game took 2 hours, 33 minutes.NEW FACEMichael Conforto went 1 for 4 with two strikeouts in his Giants debut.POLO GROUNDSGiants manager Gabe Kapler on Wednesday visited the site of the Polo Grounds, the Giants’ home from 1891-1957.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851896,Sports betting bill wins final OK from Kentucky lawmakers,"FRANKFORT,, Ky. (AP) — A bill to legalize sports betting in Kentucky won final legislative approval Thursday, clearing the last hurdle in the Senate after days of uncertainty over whether backers could muster enough support.With only hours left in this year's legislative session, the Republican-dominated Senate passed the measure 25-12, sending it to Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear, who has long supported the issue.“We love our sports in the commonwealth,” Republican Senate Majority Leader Damon Thayer said in promoting the bill during debate. “And people want to be able to make the choice — of their own free will — to make a wager on a sports event, like almost all of our surrounding states.”The Democratic governor, who has advocated for sports betting throughout his term, hailed the bill's passage, declaring in a social media post: “Kentuckians will soon be able to place their bets here and for the first time” keep the resulting tax revenue in the Bluegrass State.The bill's fate had loomed as one of the biggest uncertainties heading toward the conclusion of the 30-day legislative session. Supporters needed a minimum of 23 votes to pass it because it’s a revenue-producing bill in a non-budget year. The Senate ultimately decided to allow residents in the state that’s home to the Kentucky Derby to legally wager on other sporting events.The bill would legalize, regulate and tax sports wagering in Kentucky. Supporters said it's estimated to generate about $23 million a year in tax revenue and licensing fees. Thayer said he thinks that the estimate is low.Opponents called sports betting a highly addictive form of gambling that would hurt Kentucky families. Referring to the revenue estimates, Republican Sen. Whitney Westerfield said during the debate: “Ask yourselves, how much money people of Kentucky have to lose before we get that?”“There will be people hurt by this,"" Westerfield said. ""There will be people who can’t afford to bet, who will bet anyway.”The bill would allow Kentucky’s horse racing tracks to be licensed as sports betting facilities for a $500,000 upfront fee and an annual renewal cost of $50,000.Participating tracks could contract with up to three service providers for sports wagering services at the track itself, or through online sites and mobile applications. Service providers would have to pay $50,000 for an initial license and $10,000 a year to renew.The Kentucky Horse Racing Commission would regulate sports wagering operations.Revenue from taxing such wagering would cover regulatory costs. A percentage of the revenue would go to a fund to help combat problem gambling. After that, the revenue would go to the state public pension system.Thayer, a long-running proponent for legal sports wagering, said he views it as an extension of “our time-honored tradition of betting on horse races.”“This is a great day for the commonwealth and its people,” he said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851898,"Trump indictment live updates: Latest news, developments","WASHINGTON (AP) — In the first criminal case against a former president, Donald Trump has been indicted on charges involving payments made during the 2016 campaign to silence claims of an extramarital sexual encounter.Trump is facing multiple charges of falsifying business records, including at least one felony offense, in the indictment handed down against him by a New York grand jury, two people familiar with the matter have told The Associated Press. They were not authorized to discuss details that aren’t yet public and requested anonymity.Prosecutors in New York investigated money paid to porn actor Stormy Daniels and ex-Playboy model Karen McDougal to keep the women from going public with claims that they had sex with him.Trump, who's running for the White House again in 2024, called the decision by a Manhattan grand jury to indict him “political persecution and election interference at the highest level.”At least one former federal prosecutor, though, said the Manhattan DA and other investigators wouldn't move forward with such a case unless they feel confident of a conviction.___WILL NEW YORK CASE OVERSHADOW OTHER LEGAL THREATS?Former President Donald Trump faces multiple investigations related to his refusal to accept his loss of the 2020 presidential election.Some legal experts worry that Trump's indictment this week in New York involving a hush money payment in 2016 could jeopardize public trust in the election-related cases.The indictment itself has remained sealed, which is standard in New York until an arraignment.Trump has long argued that the investigations in New York and elsewhere are politically motivated and ramped up those accusations without evidence after Thursday's indictment.___LITTLE SIGNS OF LARGE PROTEST IN NEW YORK, ELSEWHEREThough the streets outside the Manhattan courthouse were bustling Friday, there was no sign of any large-scale protests. A few Trump supporters passed by, quickly posing for photos while police officers and reporters lined the sidewalks.In Florida, about a dozen Trump supporters stood alongside the road leading to Mar-a-Lago, the former president’s Palm Beach residence and resort Friday morning. They waved “Trump Nation” and “Keep America Great” flags at motorists.Kevin Hulbert, a retired outdoor educator from Maryland, waved an American flag as he called the indictment “a disgrace.”“We have to use our First Amendment rights to demonstrate how unhappy we are that something like this would happen,” Hulbert said.In Boston, several people rallied outside the Massachusetts Statehouse to support letting the legal process play out.Laurie Woodward-Garcia, 56, of Westborough, said she was not there to celebrate and defended Trump’s right to have his day in court.“I think it’s important that whoever you are, whatever position you hold, the message is clear: No one is above the law,” she said.___WILL TRUMP TRY TO TURN MUG SHOT INTO A TOOL?Former President Donald Trump is expected to go through the same process as anyone turning him or herself in on criminal charges, including fingerprinting and a mug shot.Recent history offers examples of political figures who tried to turn arrest photos into a tool, including former Texas Gov. Rick Perry and former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay.New York law discourages the release of mug shots in most cases, though some have leaked in the past. It's unclear whether Trump would try to have the picture released himself, for political or other reasons.But his presidential campaign and other political groups quickly used word of his indictment in fundraising messages. The National Republican Congressional Committee titled an email sent to supporters Friday: “Trump IN HANDCUFFS!?”___BIDEN ADMINISTRATION STAYS MUM ON CASEPresident Joe Biden set the tone for his administration’s approach to former President Donald Trump’s indictment Friday with a firm refusal to comment on the case.Vice President Kamala Harris and White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre separately refused. Both told reporters that the decision is tied to the ongoing nature of the case against Trump.“Look, we’re just not going to comment on any ongoing case, and I will just leave it there,” Jean-Pierre told reporters on Air Force One en route to Mississippi, where the president toured recent storm damage.___BRAGG'S OFFICE DEFENDS INQUIRYManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office is defending the unprecedented criminal case against Trump in a letter to House Republicans, calling their repeated criticism of the investigation “unnecessary and unjustified.""The letter, the only substantial public comment on the case to come from Bragg’s office since Thursday’s indictment, is the latest back-and-forth between Trump’s allies in Congress and the prosecutor leading the Manhattan case.“Even worse, based on your reportedly close collaboration with Mr. Trump in attacking this Office and the grand jury process, it appears you are acting more like criminal defense counsel trying to gather evidence for a client than a legislative body seeking to achieve a legitimate legislative objective,” general counsel Leslie Dubeck wrote to three Republican chairmen in a letter obtained Friday by The Associated Press.Reps. Jim Jordan, James Comer and Bryan Steil have criticized the grand jury investigation as an “unprecedented abuse of prosecutorial authority.”The chairmen had requested testimony as well as documents and copies of any communications with the Justice Department.Bragg did not answer reporters' questions on the indictment against Trump on Friday morning after he attended a high-profile sentencing hearing in an unrelated case.",2023/04/01,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851900,Donald Trump has been indicted. Here's what happens next,"NEW YORK (AP) — Every day, hundreds of people are taken into law enforcement custody in New York City. Former President Donald Trump will become one of them next week.Trump was indicted by a Manhattan grand jury and is scheduled to be arraigned Tuesday afternoon after an investigation into payments made during his 2016 presidential campaign to silence claims of an extramarital sexual encounter. The indictment itself remains sealed for now in the first criminal case ever brought against a former U.S. president.Trump — a Republican who assailed the case Thursday as a Democratic prosecutor's “political persecution” of “a completely innocent person” — is expected to turn himself in to authorities next week, according to three people familiar with the matter but not authorized to discuss it publicly. The people said the details of a surrender are still being worked out.Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office said it had contacted Trump's lawyer to coordinate his surrender and arraignment.For any New York defendant, poor or powerful, answering criminal charges means being fingerprinted and photographed, fielding basic questions such as name and birthdate, and getting arraigned. All told, defendants are typically detained for at least several hours.There can be differences in where the different steps happen, how long they take, whether handcuffs come out and other particulars. A lot depends on the severity of the case and whether defendants arrange to turn themselves in.But there is no playbook for booking an ex-president with U.S. Secret Service protection. Agents are tasked with the protection of former presidents unless and until they say they don’t need it. Trump has kept his detail, so agents would need to be by his side at all times.“This would be a unique outlier,” said Jeremy Saland, a defense lawyer and former prosecutor in Manhattan.When Trump turns himself in, expect a carefully choreographed and relatively quick process and release without bail (as is common in New York) — and with a focus on security. A former president isn’t likely to be paraded in cuffs across a sidewalk or through a crowded courthouse hallway, Saland predicts.“It’s a public forum, but safety is also paramount,” he notes.If defendants are notified of an indictment or an impending arrest, they often arrange to turn themselves in. Doing so can smooth the process and strengthen arguments for bail by showing that they aren’t evading the case.For example, when the former finance chief of Trump's company, Allen Weisselberg, was indicted in Manhattan on tax fraud charges in 2021, he was able to turn himself in at a courthouse side door before normal workday hours.The aim was “to reduce the likelihood that the surrender would become a media frenzy,” his lawyers wrote in a subsequent court filing.Weisselberg arrived around 6:15 a.m. and was taken to what his attorneys described as a “holding room” for booking, an interview about potential release, and other procedures. To pass the time, he'd brought a book — “Chicken Soup for the Baseball Fan's Soul” — and his lawyers supplied him with a snack, a face mask, breath mints and other items, according to the filing.Weisselberg was arraigned and released about eight hours later, after being walked into a courtroom past a phalanx of news cameras in the hallway. (Weisselberg eventually pleaded guilty to dodging taxes on job perks including a free apartment and school tuition for his grandchildren.)Disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, on the other hand, turned himself in at a Manhattan police station in 2018 to face rape and criminal sex act charges. He was briefly in a stationhouse cell, flipping through a biography of famed film director Elia Kazan, before being led out in handcuffs and taken to court under the gaze of journalists on the sidewalk — and other suspects in a courthouse booking area, where some hollered, “Yo, Harvey!”Within about three hours after his surrender, Weinstein was arraigned and released on electronic monitoring and $1 million bail. (Weinstein was eventually convicted; his appeal is now before New York's highest court. He's also been convicted on similar charges in Los Angeles.)But even a scheduled arrest is still an arrest. Defendants have to give up cellphones and some other personal items for safekeeping (and, in some cases, potential evidence), and lawyers generally aren't allowed to accompany their clients through the process. Attorneys often advise traveling light and staying mum.“Don’t make any statements. Because you think you’re helping your situation, but they can just use your statements against you — because you get caught up in the moment, you get nervous,” says Gianni Karmily, a defense lawyer who practices in New York City and on Long Island.Many arrests in New York City aren't preplanned. That can be a very different experience for defendants, even prominent ones.When a hotel housekeeper accused then-International Monetary Fund chief and potential French presidential contender Dominique Strauss-Kahn of sexually assaulting her in 2011, he was pulled off a plane at Kennedy Airport.Strauss-Kahn, who said his encounter with the woman was consensual, spent about 36 hours being questioned, arrested, undergoing various exams and waiting in such spots as a courthouse holding pen before being arraigned and jailed without bail.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851901,Rangers rally after deGrom struggles to beat Phillies 11-7,"ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) — Jacob deGrom and Aaron Nola didn't have the kind of pitchers' duel that many had anticipated when they faced off in the season opener.Robbie Grossman and Brad Miller homered in a big comeback for Texas after prized acquisition deGrom struggled in his debut, and the Rangers beat Nola and the National League champion Philadelphia Phillies 11-7 on Thursday.“I'm just glad I don't have to face (deGrom) anymore,” said Grossman, adding that the pitcher will pick up the team plenty this season. “All I can say is baseball is back and the rollercoaster of emotions in the season.”Grossman, a free-agent addition who earned the starting left field job in spring training, hit a three-run homer that tied the game at 5-5 in the middle of a nine-run outburst in the fourth inning. An inning later, Miller became the first Rangers player in 11 years to homer in consecutive season openers. His two-run shot made it 11-6.While deGrom struck out seven without a walk, the two-time National League Cy Young Award winner allowed five runs on six extra-base hits in his 3 2/3 innings. He threw 49 of 73 pitches for strikes. DeGrom signed a $185 million, five-year contract in free agency and made his fourth career start on opening day — he threw 17 scoreless innings in his three openers for the New York Mets, his team the last nine seasons.Nola, the 29-year-old right-hander making his sixth and maybe final opening-day start for the Phillies, also allowed five runs on four hits in 3 2/3 innings — he didn't allow a hit the first three. Nola is in the final year of his contract and discussions about an extension ended just before the start of the season.“The first inning took its toll on him, because it was a long inning, 21, 22 pitches,” Phillies manager Rob Thomson said. “Then got the ball up for the last inning, probably missed some locations.”The game also marked the Rangers debut of Bruce Bochy, the three-time World Series champion who was back in the dugout after a three-year retirement for his 26th opener as a manager. He had previously managed 13 seasons with the San Francisco Giants, who clinched their 2010 title in Texas, and 12 seasons with the San Diego Padres.“After a tough start, a great way to finish it,” Bochy said of the nine-run fourth that matched the highest-scoring inning ever in a season opener for Texas.The Phillies, who last season made it to their first World Series since 2009, took a 5-0 lead when No. 9 hitter Brandon Marsh, the first batter after deGrom departed, had an RBI double off Cole Ragans (1-0).Ragans got his first big league victory even while also giving up a walk while facing only three batters.Alec Bohm hit a two-run homer in the second inning on a 99 mph fastball from deGrom. Marsh and Trea Turner, in his first game with the Phillies after signing a $300 million, 11-year deal in free agency, had back-to-back triples in the third before J.T. Realmuto had an RBI double.Grossman's homer came immediately after an two-run double by Jonah Heim. The Rangers went ahead 6-5 when, with the bases loaded, Nathaniel Lowe hit a dribbler in front of the plate that turned into an RBI single off reliever Gregory Soto (0-1).OPEN AND CLOSEDThe retractable roof was opened to start the game, but was closed during the fourth inning because of potential thunderstorms in the area. It was the first time at Globe Life Field, which is in its fourth season as the Rangers' home, that the roof was closed during a game. It was overcast and 69 degrees at first pitch.QUITE A GRABRangers CF Bubba Thompson, who entered the game as a pitch-hitter in the fifth, took a homer away from Jake Cave with a leaping catch in the eighth.NO CLOCK VIOLATIONSThere were no clock violations, though there was a strange sequence in the third inning when plate umpire Jeff Nelson appeared ready to add an automatic ball before it was determined that a previous pitch had hit catcher Heim's shin guard and shattered the PitchCom device he was using. The count stayed 2-2 on Kyle Schwarber, who struck out on the next pitch.UP NEXTThe second game of the series Saturday is a matchup of 2021 All-Star pitchers. RHP Nathan Eovaldi makes his Rangers debut after signing as a free agent. RHP Zach Wheeler is 30-19 with a 2.82 ERA in his 69 starts the last three seasons since joining the Phillies.___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/31,,World

Jacob Stallings led off the inning with a single and scored on Luis Arraez's double.“Ran into a little trouble there in the sixth, a couple extra hits and a homer really kind of puts a sour taste in your mouth finishing the day,"" Scherzer said.Nimmo had three RBIs from the leadoff spot after re-signing with the Mets in the offseason for $162 million over eight years. He ripped a low slider from reliever Tanner Scott (0-1) into center field to put New York ahead 5-3 in the seventh, propelling the Mets to their 41st win in the past 53 openers.“The slider stayed over home plate,” Nimmo said. ""I kind of dug it out a little bit and was able to get the barrel there. Just happy to see it fall and get past Jazz (Chisholm Jr.) and let the guys run.”Nimmo also had a sacrifice fly that scored Daniel Vogelbach for a 1-0 lead.Before the opener, the Mets placed Justin Verlander on the injured list with a strained upper back muscle, sidelining the reigning AL Cy Young Award winner before his first appearance with the team.Miami fell to 12-19 on opening day as rookie manager Skip Schumaker began his Marlins tenure with a loss.Arraez was 2 for 4 and had a leadoff single in his first Marlins at-bat after Minnesota traded him to Miami in the offseason. The addition of last year's AL batting champion was meant to be a huge lift for Miami's offense, which was among the worst in the majors last season.Scherzer permitted four hits and struck out six. The three-time Cy Young Award winner walked two in his first opening-day start with the Mets.Drew Smith and newcomers Brooks Raley and David Robertson combined to strike out six over three shutout innings of one-hit relief.Robertson, filling in as closer after Edwin Diaz suffered a season-ending injury in the World Baseball Classic, got three outs for the save.Alcantara was lifted after giving up two walks and two singles that led to two runs in the sixth. He finished with an uncharacteristic four walks and struck out two.“First game. I know I have more opportunities to not walk anybody,” Alcantara said. ""I just have to keep working hard.""The Mets made it 2-0 in the sixth when Lindor’s sacrifice fly drove in Nimmo. Big league batting champ Jeff McNeil added an RBI single, despite being hit with a pitch clock violation when Pete Alonso, who drew a walk in the previous plate appearance, was late getting back to first base on a foul ball.FALSE STARTChisholm made his debut in center field after moving from second base when the Marlins added Arraez. Chisholm committed a costly throwing error in the sixth that allowed Starling Marte to advance from first to second. Marte eventually scored.AN MVP RETURNSMiami’s 1997 World Series MVP, Liván Hernández, threw out the ceremonial first pitch to Jeff Conine before the game.TRAINER'S ROOMMets: Verlander will continue throwing at moderate intensity and will undergo more scans in a week. … Díaz (torn right patellar tendon) was placed on the 60-day IL. … RHP Bryce Montes de Oca (Tommy John surgery) and four others were put on the 15-day injured list, retroactive to March 27: RHP Sam Coonrod (right lat strain), RHP Stephen Ridings (right lat strain), LHP José Quintana (left rib fracture) and RHP Elieser Hernandez (right shoulder strain).Marlins: LHP Steven Okert (left adductor strain), RHP Tommy Nance (right shoulder strain) and RHP Nic Enright (Hodgkin’s Lymphoma) were all placed on the 15-day IL. … INF Yuli Gurriel was selected from Triple-A Jacksonville. … RHP Max Meyer was put on the 60-day IL (Tommy John surgery).UP NEXTThe series continues Friday with New York LHP David Peterson facing LHP Jesus Luzardo.___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/31,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851904,Longtime LA politician guilty on federal corruption charges,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — A longtime Los Angeles politician was convicted Thursday on federal corruption charges in a scheme in which prosecutors said he promised to help steer a multimillion-dollar government contract to the University of Southern California if his son got a scholarship and a teaching job.Former Democratic City Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas — a one-time legislator, county supervisor and a fixture in local politics for decades — was found guilty in U.S. District Court of seven felonies, including conspiracy, bribery and fraud.The jury's verdict marked a stunning fall for a once-commanding figure in Los Angeles County politics known for his involvement in civil rights and racial issues.Marilyn Flynn, who was dean of USC’s School of Social Work from 1997 to 2018, pleaded guilty last year to one count of bribery in the case. Prosecutors said that as part of the plot, she concocted a scheme to funnel $100,000 that Ridley-Thomas provided from campaign funds through the university to a nonprofit run by his son.“When elected leaders engage in acts of corruption, our community suffers immense damage. Ridley-Thomas engaged in a corrupt conspiracy with a university dean to steer taxpayer-funded contracts to the school in exchange for benefits for his son,” U.S. Attorney Martin Estrada said in a statement.Ridley-Thomas, then a county supervisor, offered to support county contracts for USC’s School of Social Work that could potentially bring the institution millions of dollars in new revenue in return for helping his son, Sebastian Ridley-Thomas, according to prosecutors. At the time, the school had a multimillion-dollar budget deficit.Sebastian Ridley-Thomas was a state assemblyman who resigned the last day of 2017 while facing allegations that he made an unwanted sexual advance toward a Capitol staffer. The $100,000 went to his organization, known as the Policy, Research & Practice Initiative, prosecutors said.The son later received a $26,000 graduate scholarship for 2018 and was offered a paid teaching position with a $50,000 salary, even though being a student and a teacher would violate school policy, authorities said.The Los Angeles City Council suspended Mark Ridley-Thomas in October 2021, shortly after he was charged in the case. With his conviction on felony charges, Council President Paul Krekorian said in a statement the seat was vacant under city law.Krekorian said he was appointing Councilwoman Heather Hutt as a caretaker of the seat, who earlier had been named to temporarily fill the post after Ridely-Thomas was suspended. Krekorian said he would urge the council at its next meting to appoint Hutt to hold the office for the remainder of Ridley-Thomas' term.Ridley-Thomas, who denied wrongdoing, left the courthouse after the verdict without speaking to reporters. A representative for his defense team told the Los Angeles Times that he would appeal.He will be sentenced in August.Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, a longtime friend and political ally, called the verdict a “sad day for Los Angeles.”USC wasn’t accused of wrongdoing in the criminal case but it further tarnished the school’s elite image, already battered by a series of scandals.USC was one of the universities embroiled in an admissions cheating scandal in which wealthy parents sought to get their undeserving offspring into college by falsely portraying them as star athletes. Dozens of parents and athletic coaches nationwide were charged and more than 50 people were convicted in the “Operation Varsity Blues” case. They include TV actresses Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin, and Loughlin’s fashion designer husband Mossimo Giannulli.In 2021, USC agreed to an $852 million settlement with more than 700 women who accused the college’s longtime campus gynecologist of sexual abuse. It was believed to be a record amount for such a lawsuit. When combined with an earlier settlement of a separate class-action suit, USC has agreed to pay out more than $1 billion for claims against the doctor, who worked at the school for nearly three decades.",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851905,California's Newsom starts tour to boost red-state Democrats,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California Gov. Gavin Newsom dropped $10 million on a new political action committee Thursday, pledging to boost Democrats in the reddest of red states ahead of the 2024 election and what could be a future run for president.Newsom launched the Campaign for Democracy using money left over from his 2022 campaign for governor, where he easily won reelection against a little-known Republican opponent. In a video announcing the committee, Newsom pledged to take on “authoritarian leaders” he says are “directly attacking our freedoms,” including Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.“What’s happening in those red states?” Newsom asked. “That’s not who we are. It’s un-American. It’s un-democratic.”Newsom blamed those governors for banning books and targeting transgender children. Republicans, meanwhile, have criticized Newsom for using taxpayer money to pay for women in other states to come to California for abortions and to cover the health care expenses of people living in the country without legal permission.“There’s a reason why Gavin Newsom never focuses on the problems he’s caused in his own state,” Sanders spokesperson Alexa Henning said. “California residents are experiencing sky high rent but Governor Sanders is living rent free in his head.”Newsom and his family will visit Alabama, Arkansas and Mississippi early next week, meeting with Democratic activists who are pushing for things like expanding Medicaid and resisting Sanders' education proposals. But first, he'll appear at a fundraiser Saturday in Florida for the Democratic Governors Association, spokesperson Nathan Click said.A donation blitz to candidates in other states is a typical pathway to a presidential campaign for ambitious politicians. Most of the time, money is targeted at swing states or places with early presidential primaries where donations can pay dividends later.Newsom, however, is taking on states with little strategic political value for Democrats, part of his ongoing effort to reshape the Democratic Party's message.“He's been saying we can't go just to the 12 states that are on the line; we've got to go to the states where we lose and help the people who are on the front lines with these fights,"" Click said.Other Democrats have tried to use their star power to help candidates around the country — some in heavily Republican areas.On the heels of his 2020 Senate run against South Carolina Republican Lindsey Graham — which busted fundraising records but resulted in a loss to the incumbent — Jaime Harrison launched Dirt Road PAC, utilizing his newly minted status as a fundraising powerhouse to try to provide a sustained boost to other Democrats that he hopes can help flip more areas from red to blue.Dirt Road has continued to operate as Harrison has taken over as Democratic National Committee chair, raising about $200,000 before the end of last year, according to federal filings.Such efforts have not always been successful. In 2013, Jeremy Bird, who was the national field director for then-President Barack Obama’s reelection campaign the previous year, helped organize Battleground Texas, which vowed to make long-term financial and organizing commitments to Democratic causes in the nation’s largest Republican state.The group invested heavily in 2014 Democratic governor candidate Wendy Davis, who lost big to Republican Abbott. Nearly 10 years later, Texas Democrats still haven’t won a statewide office since 1994, the nation’s longest losing streak.Individual elected officials have gotten into the act, too, like Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Weeks after dropping out of the 2020 presidential race, she announced a political group called Warren Democrats that saw her endorse, campaign with and provide financial and logistical support for progressive congressional candidates that cycle and last year. The records of candidates backed by Warren were mixed, and she is now running for reelection next year to the Senate.Last year, amid some unease among Democrats about President Joe Biden's prospects for reelection, Newsom's name was floated as a potential replacement for 2024. Newsom quickly shut those rumors down, saying he had no desire to run for president. However, he has continued to build his profile as a national leader, spending his campaign money for governor last year on ads in Republican-led states, including Florida and Texas.“He's clearly building his national profile and presence,” said Eric Schickler, a political science professor at the University of California, Berkeley. “It's a way that taps into something that a a lot of Democrats have been concerned about, which is that there is not much of a party presence in a lot of the red states.”Newsom’s second term as governor will end in 2026. He has said he won’t challenge Biden for the presidency. Were he to run in 2028, he’d potentially be going up against Vice President Kamala Harris, a fellow Californian.___Associated Press reporters Will Weissert in Washington and Meg Kinnard in Columbia, S.C., contributed.",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851906,High inflation pushes poverty rate even higher in Argentina,"BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — One of the world’s highest inflation rates is making it more difficult to make ends meet in Argentina, where at the end of last year nearly four of every 10 people were poor, official figures revealed Thursday.Poverty increased to 39.2% of the population in the second half of 2022, a three percentage point increase from the first six months of the year, said Argentina’s national statistics agency, INDEC. Among children under age 15, the poverty rate increased more than three percentage points to 54.2%.In a poor neighborhood in Argentina’s capital, those who run a soup kitchen don’t need the statistics to tell them what they have been seeing amid an economy wracked by inflation that reached 94.8% last year.“There’s more poverty than before,” said Graciela Gamarra, who runs the soup kitchen in the Fraga district that hands out more than 800 portions of food every weekday afternoon.“After the pandemic, everything got worse,"" she said. ""Most have precarious jobs, they don’t have fixed employment to say that they’re sure about how much they’ll make each month.”Rosa Guerrera, 76, was one of the people who went to the soup kitchen with her plastic container to get food on a recent afternoon.“If it weren’t for the soup kitchen, what would become of me?” Guerrera said, noting that more people from outside the neighborhood had been arriving recently to ask for food.Experts say inflation has hit lower middle class families particularly hard as the price of food has increased more than other items.“If the inflationary question isn’t resolved, it will be very difficult to recover purchasing power and lower the poverty level,” said Eduardo Donza, a researcher at the Social Debt Observatory at Catholic University of Argentina.Even if inflation were to magically disappear, though, “it wouldn’t be enough, because the poverty level is associated with a very precarious job market,” Donza added.The percentage of Argentina's population considered destitute — those whose income won't even cover basic, minimal food needs — decreased slightly to 8.1% from 8.8%.The decline was largely due to welfare programs, without which the destitution rate would be around 18%, Donza estimated.The government's efforts to cool inflation have been made even more difficult by a devastating drought that has increased costs even further. The annual rate of inflation rose above 100% in February.Although the poverty rate has decreased slightly from 42% in the second half of 2020 at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, it will undoubtedly be one of the main issues in the presidential campaign ahead of October elections. President Alberto Fernández has still not said whether he will seek reelection.Members of the opposition were quick to criticize the government when the latest poverty figures came out.“More than 18 million Argentines are poor,” former Buenos Aires Gov. María Eugenia Vidal wrote on Twitter. “And you know what the worst part is? This information is already outdated. The situation in 2023 is even more serious.”For now, many Argentines don't have much faith that things could improve, even with new leadership.“All the politicians promise, promise, and once they’re there, they don’t see you, they don’t listen to you,” said Gamarra, at the soup kitchen. “Most people here think the same way — just promises they don’t fulfill.”",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851907,"Veterans Harrington, Kuchar share early lead at Texas Open","SAN ANTONIO (AP) — Veterans Padraig Harrington and Matt Kuchar each shot a 4-under 68 on Thursday to share the early lead with MJ Daffue and Roberto Diaz in the weather-delayed first round of the Valero Texas Open.Daffue eagled the par-5 18th hole at TPC San Antonio and Diaz made birdie on 18 to join the 51-year-old Harrington — who has played on the PGA Tour, European tour and PGA Tour Champions this year — and the 44-year-old Kuchar atop the leaderboard.“I’m an optimistic, pretty enthusiastic person,” Harrington said. “I wake up and the minute I hit a golf shot I’m dreaming I’m going to find the secret. Even though there isn’t one, you’re always hopeful, dreaming. Let’s see if I really am better out there with the kids.”Play was delayed by fog in the morning, which prevented the afternoon half of the field from finishing their rounds on Thursday. Among the late starters, Justin Lower was 5 under through eight holes and Patrick Rodgers was 4 under through 13 when play was suspended because of darkness.Matt Wallace — a winner last week in the Dominican Republic — shot 69 along with Garrick Higgo, Harry Higgs, Chez Reavie and Nick Taylor.Daffue had the biggest finish. He holed a 27-foot putt for birdie on the par-4 17th hole. He hammered a 291-yard second shot to the back edge of the green on 18, and converted a 14-footer from the fringe for a 5-under 31 on the back nine.“It was a jumper lie (on 18),” Daffue said, “and it was right at the max of my 7-wood and I said ‘I’m going to hit it. I’m feeling this one.’ It was a good day.”The 34-year-old Daffue is seeking his first PGA Tour victory. Diaz, playing on a sponsor's exemption, finished with a 14-foot birdie.Harrington and Kuchar are both seeking their first win this decade. Kuchar won twice in 2019. Harrington, who won four times last year on the over-50 tour, hasn't won on the PGA Tour since the Honda Classic in 2015. The three-time major champion's most recent European tour victory was the Portugal Masters in 2016.This month, Harrington was announced as an inductee in the 2024 class to the World Golf Hall of Fame. The last time he was in the top three after his first round was at PGA National eight years ago, when he went on to win.A victory this week would also get Harrington into the Masters for the second time since 2015; he missed the cut at Augusta National last year.Harrington started on the back nine and ran off three straight birdies around the turn and two more on the fourth and fifth holes before closing with four straight pars.Kuchar opened with a bogey on No. 10, then sat for more than two hours before the fog lifted. He made three birdies on the final five holes of his first nine, then converted 3-footers for birdie on Nos. 5 and 8.“If you start playing some indifferent golf, this course can jump up and bite you,” Kuchar said. “I was lucky to get away with a couple of loose ones today.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851908,"Trump indictment and hush money investigation, explained","Donald Trump has become the first former president to be indicted in a criminal case after a grand jury investigation into hush money payments made on his behalf during the 2016 presidential campaign.The unprecedented indictment comes as the Republican faces other legal investigations and launches a bid to return to the White House in 2024.The indictment will test the Republican Party already divided over whether to support Trump next year, in part due to his efforts to undermine his 2020 election loss.Trump has denied any wrongdoing and accuses prosecutors of engaging in a politically motivated “witch hunt” to damage his campaign.Here's a look at the hush money case, the grand jury investigation and possible ramifications for Trump's presidential campaign:WHAT'S THIS CASE ABOUT?The New York grand jury spent weeks meeting in secret to probe Trump’s involvement in a $130,000 payment made in 2016 to the porn actor Stormy Daniels to keep her from going public about a sexual encounter she said she had with him years earlier. Trump lawyer Michael Cohen paid Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, through a shell company before being reimbursed by Trump, whose company, the Trump Organization, logged the reimbursements as legal expenses.Earlier in 2016, Cohen also arranged for former Playboy model Karen McDougal to be paid $150,000 by the publisher of the supermarket tabloid The National Enquirer, which then squelched her story in a journalistically dubious practice known as “catch and kill.”Trump denies having sex with either woman.Trump’s company “grossed up” Cohen’s reimbursement for the Daniels payment to defray tax payments, according to federal prosecutors who filed criminal charges against the lawyer in connection with the payments in 2018. In all, Cohen got $360,000 plus a $60,000 bonus, for a total of $420,000.Cohen pleaded guilty to violating federal campaign finance law in connection with the payments. Federal prosecutors say the payments amounted to illegal, unreported assistance to Trump’s campaign. But they declined to file charges against Trump himself.WHAT'S AN INDICTMENT?An indictment is the formal charge brought against someone after a grand jury — which is made up of members of the community — votes and enough members agree there's sufficient evidence to charge someone with a crime.The indictment against Trump remains sealed, as is standard in New York before an arraignment. But once the document is made public, it will lay out the crime or crimes that Trump is accused of committing. Sometimes indictments include a lengthy narrative with lots of details about the allegations, while others are more basic and just outline the charges a defendant is facing.WHAT ARE THE CHARGES?The indictment has not yet been unsealed, so it's not totally clear.Some experts have said they believe Trump could be charged with falsifying business records, which can be a misdemeanor or a felony under New York law. To secure a conviction on the felony charge, prosecutors would have to prove that records were falsified with the intention of committing or concealing a second crime. It's not clear what prosecutors may allege as the second crime.WHAT HAS TRUMP'S LAWYER SAID?Trump's lawyer, Joe Tacopina, said Thursday that the former president didn't commit any crime and vowed to “vigorously fight this political prosecution in court.”Tacopina has accused prosecutors of “distorting laws"" to try to take down the former president. He has described Trump as a victim of extortion who had to pay the money because the allegations were going to be embarrassing to him “regardless of the campaign.”“He made this with personal funds to prevent something from coming out — false, but embarrassing to himself, his family, his young son. That's not a campaign finance violation, not by any stretch,"" Tacopina said on ABC's “Good Morning America” before the indictment.WHAT'S THIS GRAND JURY AND WHO TESTIFIED?A grand jury is made up of people drawn from the community, similar to a trial jury. But unlike juries that hear trials, grand juries don’t decide whether someone is guilty or innocent. They only decide whether there is enough evidence for someone to be charged.Proceedings are closed to the public, including the media. New York grand juries have 23 people. At least 16 must be present to hear evidence or deliberate and 12 have to agree there is enough evidence in order to issue an indictment.David Pecker, a longtime Trump friend and the former chief executive of the parent company of The National Enquirer, returned to the courthouse this week where the grand jury was meeting.Pecker's company, American Media Inc., secretly assisted Trump’s campaign by paying $150,000 to McDougal in August 2016 for the rights to her story about an alleged affair with Trump. The company then suppressed McDougal’s story until after the election.The grand jury also heard from Cohen, as well as Robert Costello, who was once a legal adviser to Cohen.The men have since had a falling out, and Costello indicated he has information he believes undercuts Cohen's credibility and contradicts his incriminating statements about Trump. Costello testified at the invitation of prosecutors, presumably as a way to ensure that the grand jury had an opportunity to consider any testimony or evidence that might weaken the case for moving forward with an indictment.Trump was also invited to testify, but didn't.WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?Law enforcement officials have been making security preparations for days for the possibility of an indictment and a court appearance by the president.Trump is expected to turn himself in and make his first court appearance for his arraignment on Tuesday. When he turns himself in, he isn’t expected to be put in handcuffs, according to a person familiar with the matter. Secret Service agents assigned to him will escort him through the booking process at the Manhattan district attorney’s office, but prosecutors have no plans to shackle Trump’s hands during it, the person said.WHAT ARE THE POLITICAL RAMIFICATIONS FOR TRUMP?Neither the indictment itself nor a conviction would prevent Trump from running for or winning the presidency in 2024.Last week in Waco, Texas, Trump took a defiant stance at a rally by disparaging the prosecutors investigating him and predicting his vindication as he rallied supporters in a city made famous by deadly resistance against law enforcement.“You will be vindicated and proud,” Trump said in a speech brimming with resentments and framing the probes as political attacks on himself and his followers. “The thugs and criminals who are corrupting our justice system will be defeated, discredited and totally disgraced.”Before the charges were handed down, many party leaders had also already begun to defend the former president.During a visit this month to Iowa, former Vice President Mike Pence called the idea of indicting a former president “deeply troubling.” Another 2024 Republican prospect, New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, has said there is a sense that the former president is being unfairly attacked.Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, a declared candidate who also served as Trump's U.N. ambassador, has called Bragg's case an attempt at scoring “political points,"" adding, “You never want to condone any sort of prosecution that's being politicized.”Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is considering joining the 2024 Republican field, slammed the investigation as politically motivated. But he also threw one of his first jabs at the former president in a quip likely to intensify their rivalry. DeSantis said he personally doesn’t “know what goes into paying hush money to a porn star to secure silence over some kind of alleged affair.”WHAT ABOUT OTHER TRUMP INVESTIGATIONS?The New York case is just one of many legal woes Trump is facing.The Justice Department is also investigating his retention of top secret government documents at his Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, after leaving the White House. Federal investigators are also still probing the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol and efforts to overturn the 2020 election that Trump falsely claimed was stolen.In Georgia, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis has been investigating whether Trump and his allies illegally meddled in the 2020 election.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851909,"52 years after capture, orca Lolita may return to Pacific","MIAMI (AP) — More than 50 years after the orca known as Lolita was captured for public display, plans are in place to return her from the Miami Seaquarium to her home waters in the Pacific Northwest, where a nearly century-old, endangered killer whale believed to be her mother still swims.An unlikely coalition involving the theme park's owner, an animal rights group and an NFL owner-philanthropist announced the agreement during a news conference Thursday.“I'm excited to be a part of Lolita's journey to freedom,” Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay said. “I know Lolita wants to get to free waters.”Lolita, also known as Tokitae, was about 4 years old when she was captured in Puget Sound in summer 1970, during a time of deadly orca roundups. She spent decades performing for paying crowds before falling ill.Last year the Miami Seaquarium announced it would no longer stage shows with her, under an agreement with federal regulators. Lolita — now 57 years old and 5,000 pounds (2,267 kilograms) — currently lives in a tank that measures 80 feet by 35 feet (24 meters by 11 meters) and is 20 feet (6 meters) deep.The orca believed to be her mother, called Ocean Sun, continues to swim free with other members of their clan — known as L pod — and is estimated to be more than 90 years old. That has given advocates of her release optimism that Tokitae could still maybe have a long life in the wild.“It's a step toward restoring our natural environment, fixing what we've messed up with exploitation and development,” said Howard Garrett, president of the board of the advocacy group Orca Network, based on Washington state's Whidbey Island. “I think she'll be excited and relieved to be home — it's her old neighborhood.""The agreement among Irsay; Eduardo Albor, who heads The Dolphin Company, which owns the Seaquarium; and the Florida nonprofit Friends of Toki, co-founded by environmentalist Pritam Singh; still faces hurdles to gaining government approval.The time frame for moving the animal could be 18 to 24 months away, the group said, and the cost could reach $20 million.The plan is to transport Lolita by plane to an ocean sanctuary in the waters between Washington and Canada, where she will initially swim inside a large net while trainers and veterinarians teach her how to catch fish.She will also have to build up her muscles, as orcas typically swim about 100 miles (160 kilometers) per day, said Raynell Morris, an elder of the Lummi Indian Tribe in Washington who also serves on the board of Friends of Toki.“She was 4 when she was taken, so she was learning to hunt. She knows her family song,” Morris said. “She'll remember, but it will take time.”The orca would be under 24-hour care until she acclimates to her new surroundings.Caretakers at the Seaquarium are already preparing her for the journey, officials said.The Dolphin Company took ownership of the Seaquarium in 2021. It operates some 27 other parks and habitats in Mexico, Argentina, the Caribbean and Italy.The legacy of the whale roundups of the 1960s and '70s continues to haunt a distinct group of endangered, salmon-eating orcas that are known as the southern resident killer whales and spend much of their time in the waters between Washington and Canada.At least 13 orcas died in the roundups and 45 were delivered to theme parks around the world, reducing the Puget Sound resident population by about 40% and helping cause problems with inbreeding that remain a problem today.Today only 73 remain in the southern resident population, which comprises three familial groups called pods, according to the Center for Whale Research on Washington state’s San Juan Island. That’s just two more animals than in 1971.Animal rights advocates including People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals have long fought for Tokitae to spend her final years back home in a controlled setting.Activists often protest along the road that runs by the Seaquarium, which they've referred to as an “abusement park.” PETA says it doesn't want Lolita to suffer the same fate as her partner Hugo, who died in 1980 from a brain aneurysm after ramming his head repeatedly into the tank's walls.Albor said Thursday that back when his company was acquiring the Seaquarium, he and his daughter visited as tourists. He said his daughter became upset while watching Lolita's show, even as many other in the crowd were squealing in delight.His daughter told him “this place is too small for Lolita” and made him promise to help the orca if his company bought the park.“It has always been our commitment at The Dolphin Company that we place the highest priority on the well-being of the animals above all else,” Albor said. “Finding a better future for Lolita is one of the reasons that motivated us to acquire the Miami Seaquarium.”Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava called the relocation plan historic, saying, “So many have hoped and prayed for this result for many, many years.""The Seaquarium opened in 1955 on Virginia Key east of downtown Miami. It features a variety of creatures including dolphins, sea lions, manatees, reef fish and sharks, and was the filming location for 88 episodes of the “Flipper” TV series as well as movies in the 1960s.___Johnson reported from Seattle.",2023/03/31,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851912,HIMA Expands its Asia Pacific Operations with Presence through New Taiwan Office,"Opening of branch office reaffirms HIMA’s commitment to customers and partners in Taiwan 
TAIWAN, TAIPEI -  Media OutReach - 31 March 2023 -  HIMA, a leading provider of safety related automation solutions for the  Process and  Railway industries, announced its new branch office in Taiwan on 29th March 2023. Graced by Mr. Friedhelm Best, HIMA Vice President Region Asia Pacific, the opening of this office affirms HIMA's commitment to customers and partners in Taiwan and boosts HIMA's presence in Asia Pacific.   ""The opening of this branch office will further strengthen our service capabilities to customers and partners in Taiwan and improve the efficiency of local business transactions, aligning with the group's global priority towards customer orientation,"" said Mr. Best.   As specialists in safety, HIMA aims to play their part in Taiwan with their technology and expertise – offering solutions that include safety controllers and software for functional safety, which can be seamlessly connected to existing control systems in process and rail applications.   Process Industry   With over 50,000 safety solutions installed worldwide in 80 different countries, HIMA is looking to add to that number with more installations within Taiwan. The processing of chemical and petrochemicals is one of the most important industrial sectors worldwide, as well as one of the most competitive.   ""To keep on top of the competition, many companies are pushing the limits of their plants which means exposing technology, the environment, and their employees to higher risk,"" said Mr. Best. ""HIMA solutions comprehensively safeguard plants and allow them to operate more productively and profitably, all with the peace of mind that all legal standards are adhered to.""   One solution used in different cases worldwide is HIMA's line of Emergency Shut Down Systems, with  HIMatrix being a popular choice. Installed in  APA Group's (Australia's largest natural gas infrastructure business) gas storage facility, the controller ensures maximum safety, long term availability, as well as future-proofing – since they fulfil all requirements for functional safety in the process industry (IEC 61511) and provide effective protection against the growing threat of cyber-attacks (IEC 62443), falling nicely in line with the HIMA's #safetygoesdigital tagline.   Rail Industry   For decades, railway companies in particular have had to turn to expensive, proprietary solutions in order to meet legal requirements for safety. However, with cost pressures and cybersecurity vulnerabilities on the rise in the digital age, solutions must be cost efficient, fast to implement and fulfil strict safety and cybersecurity standards. More system integrators, rolling stock manufacturers and railway operators are opting for a standardized commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) system for a cost-effective and sustainable safety solution.   ""With recent railway incidents triggering awareness on safety within the industry, the priority of people's safety along with protection of the environment has become crucial topics that the authorities want to address,"" said Ms. Tracy Lau, HIMA Taiwan branch office manager. ""It is our commitment to provide the technological know-how and the best service to customers in Taiwan. The opening of this branch office will ensure they will receive it.""   HIMA has nearly 1,000 railway safety installations in more than 30 countries, with applications ranging from interlocking, level crossing and rolling stock across high speed rail, mainline rail, metro and light rail, using the game-changing  commercial-off-the-shelf COTS safety controllers developed by HIMA. These open safety controllers enable any system integrator to integrate into their own safety solutions, and end customers to be independent of providers, yet meeting strict safety standards in the rail industry. HIMA controllers can be easily installed, quickly supplied with spare parts, and comply with the strict SIL 4 standard in accordance with CENELEC.   Presence in Taiwan   Despite the opening their latest branch office, HIMA is not new to Taiwan, having previously replaced existing relay systems with HIMA SIL4 COTS among railway systems within Taiwan. In doing so, the reliability and availability of the system was further improved, eliminating the constant train delay that was caused by the failing of the existing relay system. Elsewhere, HIMA also lists the LNG, refinery, petrochemical process, and power plant industries as areas where their expertise can improve functional safety within Taiwan.   ""Our company's priority in the rapidly developing Asia Pacific region is to offer tailor-made solutions and services that address the safety challenges specific to the market and cater to the unique requirements of our customers,"" said Mr. Best. ""Our local presence here in Taiwan will allow us to offer advanced safety knowledge and technical services, safeguarding individuals, enterprises, and the environment.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851928,UK agrees to join Pacific trade pact in post-Brexit deal,"LONDON (AP) — The U.K. has agreed to join an Asia-Pacific trade pact that includes Japan, Mexico and Australia — the biggest new trade deal Britain has struck since leaving the European Union three years ago.The British government said Friday that it had clinched an agreement after almost two years of negotiations to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, or CPTPP.The government said membership would reduce tariffs on British dairy products and other goods and remove red tape for services, boosting the U.K. economy by 1.8 billion pounds ($2.2 billion) “in the long run.”Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said the deal “demonstrates the real economic benefits of our post-Brexit freedoms.”“Joining the CPTPP trade bloc puts the U.K. at the center of a dynamic and growing group of Pacific economies, as the first new nation and first European country to join,” Sunak said.The deal comes as the U.K. pursues an “Indo-Pacific tilt” in its economic and foreign policy in response to the region’s economic growth, and China’s rising influence on the world stage.Critics said the deal with nations thousands of miles away is insignificant compared to Britain’s trade with its neighbors in the 27-nation EU. Brexit has imposed barriers to trade between Britain and the bloc, which remains by far the U.K.’s biggest economic partner. The government’s Office for Budget responsibility said in November that Brexit had had “a significant adverse impact on U.K. trade.”David Henig, a trade expert at the European Center for International Political Economy, said CPTPP membership would not have a huge economic impact but “on balance” it was good for Britain.“Doesn’t do a lot for us (services provisions for example are weak), but trade policy is all about marginal gains these days, and it should be that,” he wrote on Twitter.Members of the CPTPP are Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam.The United States, the world’s biggest economy, is not part of the CPTTP; former President Donald Trump withdrew the country from its predecessor, the Trans-Pacific Partnership. His successor, Joe Biden, has not rejoined.China, which has the globe’s second-largest economy, has applied to join, a move that would quadruple the group’s total population to some 2 billion people.",2023/03/31,,World

The trophy is traveling to all 32 countries competing in this year’s World Cup in Australia and New Zealand.The mayors of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo have each expressed interest in having their cities host the final if Brazil wins the bid.Brazil hosted the men’s World Cup in 1950 and 2014.The Brazilian women's team was runner-up at the 2007 World Cup in China, losing the final 2-0 to Germany.FIFA is expected to announce its choice of host for 2027 next year.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851931,"Pablo Lopez, Twins' bullpen blank Royals 2-0 on opening day","KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — Twins manager Rocco Baldelli leaned forward in his visiting office, turned over his lineup card for opening day against the Royals and began reading the blue marker scribbled down the back.“There were a lot of highlights today,” Baldelli said. “I had to make a list.”It began with Pablo Lopez.The right-hander dominated Kansas City in his Minnesota debut Thursday, outpitching former Cy Young Award winner Zack Greinke by allowing just two hits while lasting into the sixth inning. Lopez's bullpen took over from there, holding the Royals without another hit to finish off a 2-0 victory at breezy Kauffman Stadium.“Obviously, I was aware of what the Twins gave up to bring me and the other guys,” said Lopez, acquired from Miami in January along with two other players for All-Star second baseman and fan favorite Luis Arraez.“The team is putting this much trust in me,” Lopez said. “I'm going to make the most of it. That's how I look at it.”Lopez walked three and struck out eight before leaving after 5 1/3 innings. By that point, Trevor Larnach and pinch-hitter Donovan Solano had driven in runs to give Minnesota the lead, and a trio of relievers carried it into the ninth inning.Jhoan Duran worked around a walk to earn the save, closing out a game played in a tidy 2 hours, 32 minutes.“Carlos Correa made all the plays at shortstop you could hope for him to make. Byron Buxton swung the bat well. The bullpen was great,” Baldelli said, continuing down his list. “We're hitting just about everyone, but we needed that to win.”The biggest bummer? The Twins left the bases loaded three times and stranded 12 in all.The Royals wish they had that many on base. Salvador Perez and Kyle Isbel had their only hits.Greinke, who like Lopez lasted 5 1/3 innings, delivered a solid start for Kansas City to begin his 20th season in the big leagues. The 39-year-old right-hander allowed both runs on six hits and a walk while striking out four.“Weird weather conditions,” said Greinke, who had trouble figuring out which direction the wind was blowing. ""I had a lot of good pitches. They put (together) some pretty good at-bats. I got out of a jam or two. Overall it was a solid mix of everything.”Even though Greinke and Lopez matched scoreless innings through the fifth, both had to wiggle out of trouble.The Twins had a pair of singles and a walk in the first inning, but Greinke rebounded to get Nick Gordon to ground out and end the threat. The Royals' erstwhile ace didn't allow another hit until Christian Vazquez singled with one out in the fifth.Lopez didn't allow a hit until Perez's shattered bat went about as far as the ball in the fourth. Lopez later loaded the bases on a double, hit batter and walk in the fifth, but he got MJ Melendez to bounce into an inning-ending double play.The Twins finally broke though in the sixth. Larnach followed Buxton's leadoff triple with a base hit, and Solano entered to face Royals reliever Amir Garrett. Solano proceeded to rip a single up the middle, extending the lead.Kansas City never threatened the rest of the way.“They had an opportunity and they capitalized,” new Royals manager Matt Quatraro said, ""and we had one and we didn’t.”CAPTAIN SALThe Royals made Perez, their seven-time All-Star catcher, the fourth captain in franchise history before the game. He's the first to wear the “C” on his jersey since Mike Sweeney in 2007; the others were George Brett and Frank White.CORREA'S RETURNCorrea singled in his first at-bat after a bizarre offseason. Lucrative deals with the Giants and Mets fell apart over concerns about his surgically repaired ankle, and the two-time All-Star returned to Minnesota on a six-year, $200 million deal.TRAINER'S ROOMTwins: RHPs Ronny Henriquez (elbow inflammation) and Josh Winder (shoulder strain), INF Jorge Polanco (knee inflammation) and OFs Gilberto Celestino (thumb surgery) and Alex Kirilloff (wrist surgery) went on the injured list before the game.Royals: OF Drew Waters (oblique strain) and LHP Daniel Lynch (rotator cuff strain) went on the IL before the game.MAKING MOVESTwins: INF/OF Willi Castro had his contract selected from Triple-A St. Paul to provide depth with Polanco and Kirilloff out.Royals: OFs Jackie Bradley Jr. and Franmil Reyes and INF Matt Duffy had contracts selected from Triple-A Omaha.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851933,Las Vegas lawyer indicted in $460M 'slip-and-fall' scheme,"LAS VEGAS (AP) — A longtime Las Vegas attorney was indicted Wednesday on federal charges that he orchestrated a $460 million Ponzi scheme spanning multiple states, from Nevada and Utah to California and Arizona.The eight-count indictment accusing Matthew Wade Beasley of wire fraud and money laundering comes almost one year to the day after the personal injury attorney was shot and wounded by FBI agents at his $1.1 million home in Las Vegas, leading to a four-hour standoff that ended with his arrest. He was charged with assault on a federal officer.Beasley has been in federal custody since the standoff — during which prosecutors have said the lawyer, then 49, “repeatedly confessed” to his involvement in the investment scheme while on the phone with a negotiator. Beasley remained in the house until FBI SWAT agents entered.Jacqueline Tirinnanzi, Beasley's attorney, declined to comment. Beasley has not yet entered a plea in the case.According to the indictment, Beasley enlisted investors for a company that claimed to offer short-term loans with high interest rates to clients awaiting payment after settling their personal injury “slip-and-fall” cases. Authorities have said investors were promised a return of up to 13% within 90 days of investing their money.But there were no clients, prosecutors said. Instead, according to the indictment, Beasley used new investor money to pay his earlier investors, creating the illusion that the company had real clients who were repaying the loans with interest.Between 2017 and March 2022, when Beasley was arrested, hundreds of people invested more than $460 million into the scheme, according to the indictment. The attorney allegedly used that money to fund what prosecutors have described as an “opulent” lifestyle, including luxury homes and cars and recreational vehicles.Beasley is scheduled to be arraigned Friday afternoon in U.S. District Court in Las Vegas. A preliminary hearing in the assault case stemming from last year's standoff also is currently scheduled for Friday, but court records show prosecutors and Beasley are in the middle of negotiations in the case.The Nevada Supreme Court suspended Beasley from practicing law in the state and barred him from handling client funds shortly after his arrest last March.",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851934,Springer's 5 hits help Jays outlast Cards 10-9 in opener,"ST. LOUIS (AP) — George Springer had five hits and Vladimir Guerrero Jr. drove in three runs as the Toronto Blue Jays beat St. Louis 10-9 on Thursday despite the Cardinals' Tyler O'Neill tying a major league record by homering on opening day for the fourth straight season.Making his Cardinals debut, catcher Willson Contreras left after the eighth inning because of an injured knee and was sent for a scan.Springer was 5 for 6 with five singles in the fourth five-hit game of his big league career to go along with a six-game game for Houston at Oakland in May 2018. Springer set a Toronto record for hits in an opener and combined with Baltimore's Adley Rutschman to become the first pair of players with five hits each on opening day since at least 1901.“It's awesome, obviously you want to start off good,” Springer said. “It's only one game. But, I'll take all the hits I can get.”Bo Bichette had four hits and Matt Chapman three for the Blue Jays, who outhit the Cardinals 19-15 and set a team record for hits in an opener.“It was a grind. It was a roller-coaster,” Toronto manager John Schneider said. “But up and down the at-bats were great.”Toronto won its fourth straight opener by overcoming a 9-8 deficit in the ninth against Ryan Helsley (0-1). Springer tied the score with an RBI single and Guerrero followed with a sacrifice fly.Cleanup hitter Daulton Varsho added a hit and two RBI. The top four hitters in the Blue Jays order were a combined 12-for-21 with seven RBI and seven runs scored.“Our offense went out there and had an amazing day,” Varsho said. “We continued to battle no matter what. That's the kind of team that we are.”O’Neill’s two-run homer in the third off Alek Manoah cut the Cardinals’ deficit to 4-3.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851935,Australia concerned by journalist's delayed verdict in China,"SYDNEY (AP) — Australia remains deeply concerned that Australian journalist Cheng Lei has not learned of a verdict a year after standing trial in China on national security charges, the foreign minister said Friday.Foreign Minister Penny Wong marked the first anniversary of the closed trial in Beijing with a statement saying her government had “advocated at every opportunity for Ms. Cheng to be reunited with her family.”“She is still waiting to learn the outcome of the trial,” Wong said. “We share the deep concerns of Ms. Cheng’s family and friends about the ongoing delays in her case.”“Our thoughts today are with Ms. Cheng and her loved ones, particularly her two children,” she added. The children live with family in the Australian city of Melbourne.Asked about Cheng's case, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning offered no new information Friday.“China has a clear and consistent position on the case. China’s judicial departments examined the case in accordance with law and fully protected the lawful rights and interests of the person involved,” Mao said at a daily briefing in Beijing.The anniversary comes as troubled relations between China and Australia show signs of improvement since Wong’s center-left Labor Party came to power in elections last year.Cheng, 47, was born in China and was a journalist for CGTN, the English-language channel of China Central Television. She was detained in August 2019 and accused by China of sharing state secrets.In January, Wong also marked the anniversary of China's detention of Chinese-Australian writer and blogger Yang Hengjun, who has been held since arriving in 2019 in southern China’s Guangzhou from New York with his wife and 14-year-old stepdaughter.Her statement then said Australia's government was “deeply troubled” by China's delays in resolving espionage allegations. Yang, 57, faced a closed trial on an espionage charge in Beijing in May 2021 and is still waiting for a verdict.Wong raised the cases of Yang and Cheng with her Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, in December when she became to first Australian foreign minister to visit China in four years.Prime Minister Anthony Albanese also raised their cases in November when he took part in the first formal bilateral meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping by an Australian government leader since 2016.China has begun accepting shipments of Australian coal in recent weeks for the first time since late 2020 in a sign of thawing relations since Australia’s former conservative administration was ousted after nine years in power.___Find more of AP’s Asia-Pacific coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851936,Jailed ex-elected Vegas official loses bid to get new judge,"LAS VEGAS (AP) — A former elected official lost a bid on Thursday to get a new judge to handle his murder case ahead of trial scheduled in November in the slaying of a Las Vegas investigative journalist.Supervising Clark County District Court Judge Jerry Wiese II told ex-county administrator of wills and estates Robert Telles that he did not find ""bias or prejudice"" in 30 minutes of pointed questioning that Judge Michelle Leavitt conducted in open court last month before deciding Telles could fire his lawyer and represent himself.“Usually it is not in the defendant’s best interest to do that,” Wiese said of Telles' request to face trial without a lawyer.Telles claimed Leavitt subjected him to “badgering and character attacks” during about 30 minutes of procedurally required questioning, including “accusations of gamesmanship and questions of mental incompetence"" that made him look bad in news reports.“Her prejudicial conduct was central to the prejudicial media stories,” Telles wrote.Telles is an attorney who handled civil matters, not criminal, before he was elected as a Democrat as Clark County administrator. His license to practice law has been suspended, but he does not have to be an attorney to represent himself.Telles is accused of fatally stabbing Las Vegas Review-Journal reporter Jeff German last September after German wrote articles critical of Telles and his managerial conduct.Police and prosecutors say the evidence is strong that Telles killed German, including Telles’ DNA found beneath German’s fingernails.But police say they haven’t completed their investigation because the Review-Journal obtained a court order blocking investigators from accessing records on German’s cellphone and computer devices.The newspaper cites concerns about improperly exposing confidential sources and notes. The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department is asking the state Supreme Court to lift that restriction and the appeal remains pending.In a new development, a panel of three state high court justices ruled this week that Leavitt can adopt a method suggested by police for a neutral party to screen the records so they can be reviewed by both sides and detectives can proceed.Leavitt has 20 years' experience as a criminal judge and specializes in handling murder trials. She submitted a sworn document declaring she has “no actual or implied bias or prejudice against Mr. Telles” and she “will not be swayed by public clamor or fear of criticism.”Leavitt is due on April 5 to hear Telles' bid to have the court appoint a “standby” attorney to assist Telles and answer legal questions. Telles, who remains jailed in Las Vegas, also wants the court to order jailers to loosen detention restrictions and provide a better legal research system so he can prepare his defense.Telles, 46, maintains that he did not kill German. But he would not tell The Associated Press during a Feb. 14 jail interview what he was doing the day German was attacked and killed in a side yard of German’s house. Telles said he wants to testify before a jury.German, 69, was widely respected in 44 years of reporting on organized crime, government corruption, political scandals and mass shootings — first at the Las Vegas Sun and then at the Review-Journal.",2023/03/31,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851938,Alcaraz turns away Fritz in Miami; Rybakina to women's final,"MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (AP) — The hopes of American men’s tennis rest largely on the talented rackets of Taylor Fritz and Tommy Paul.But a Spanish roadblock named Carlos Alcaraz is in the way – never more illustrated by the last few days at the Miami Open.Two days after routing the Australian Open semifinalist Paul, the top-ranked Alcaraz took his spectacular arsenal to the highest-ranked American man in No. 10 Fritz and blasted into the semifinals with a 6-4, 6-2 victory at Hard Rock Stadium.In the women's draw, Elena Rybakina advanced to Saturday’s finals with a 7-6 (3), 6-4 victory over Jessica Pegula in a match delayed twice by rain.Rybakina, the Wimbledon champion, won her 13th straight match and is seeking to become the fifth woman to achieve the “sunshine double” — back-to-back titles in the hard-court tournaments at Indian Wells and Miami.Before a packed crowd that included John McEnroe and was split in support, Alcaraz broke Fritz’s serve in the first game. He used that one break to squeak out the first set and finished the match in tidy 1 hour, 18 minutes. Alcaraz faced just two break points and turned away both chances as he improved his match record to 18-1 in 2023.“I took the opportunity of every break point I had,” the Spaniard said. “I was solid and aggressive at the same time.”This was the first meeting between the two and an opportunity for Fritz to assess how close he is to a breakthrough. The match was postponed Wednesday night, only delaying the inevitable.“Obviously playing the best player in the world, you can’t just drop your serve to start both sets,” Fritz said. “He doesn’t give you much for free. ... All the important points in the match, he won.”The 19-year-old Alcaraz proved too tough in Miami against two Americans who reside in South Florida. Fritz moved recently to Miami and Paul has lived in the Delray Beach/Boca Raton area for years.Alcaraz will play Jannik Sinner in Friday’s semifinals, a rematch of their semifinal at Indian Wells, where Alcaraz went on to win the title.The reigning U.S. Open champion and defending Miami Open champion boasts a glorious drop shot, beautifully controlled groundstrokes and a sneaky net game. Alcaraz’s graceful court coverage is reminiscent of his countryman Rafael Nadal. There are no clear weaknesses, as Fritz found out.Fritz had one moment to seize, gaining a break point against Alcaraz trailing 2-3, trying to get back on serve. Alcaraz saved the break point in fantastic fashion. Fritz initially made a lovely pop-up retrieve of a would-be winner, but Alcaraz boldly took a chance moments later, rushing to the net to convert a difficult low volley winner.In an earlier men's quarterfinal of extreme height, No. 5 Daniil Medvedev ended the career-best run of 6-foot-7 American qualifier Chris Eubanks with a 6-3, 7-5 victory.For all his accomplishments, the 6-6 Medvedev, who has won 22 of his last 23 matches, had never made the Miami Open semifinals.It sets up an all-Russian semifinal Friday as he faces Karen Khachanov, who beat Francisco Cerundolo 6-3, 6-2. Medvedev holds a 3-1 career advantage against his longtime friend.“We are from the same age group,” Medvedev said. “I’m almost sure we know how the match is going to go and it’s a question of who’s going to make the best shot.”Medvedev, who lost to Alcaraz in the final at Indian Wells, has garnered three ATP titles this year (Rotterdam, Doha and Dubai).Eubanks, a 26-year-old former Georgia Tech star ranked 102nd, had never advanced to a quarterfinal of an ATP event of this level and had actor Jamie Foxx in the stands cheering him on.“It’s been a dream week for me,” Eubanks said, noting Foxx has followed his career for “the past couple of years.”Eubanks was on serve with Medvedev early, leading 3-2 before a brief rain delay. Medvedev came back roaring to win the next four games to close out the set. Eubanks said Medvedev made a “tactical change” after the delay, moving in on his second serve.The other women’s semifinal was finally set with 15th seed Petra Kvitova advancing to face unseeded, 74th-ranked Sorana Cirstea, who beat Australian Open champion Aryna Sabalenka on Wednesday.In a quarterfinal postponed by Wednesday night’s rain, Kvitova defeated No. 18 seed Ekaterina Alexandrova 6-4, 3-6, 6-3.Shaking off a rash of double faults in the second, Kvitova prevailed in the third, but she could be at a competitive disadvantage without a day of rest facing Cirstea. Neither Kvitova nor Cirstea will have an extra day to prepare for Saturday’s final against Rybakina.___AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851939,"Trump criminally charged in New York, a first for a US ex-president","Donald Trump has been indicted by a Manhattan grand jury after a probe into hush money paid to porn star Stormy Daniels, becoming the first former U.S. president to face criminal charges even as he makes another run for the White House.The charges from an investigation led by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg come as Trump seeks the Republican nomination to run again in 2024.The specific charges are not yet known, as the indictment remains under seal. CNN reported Trump faces more than 30 counts related to business fraud.Trump said he was ""completely innocent"" and indicated he would not drop out of the race. He accused Bragg, a Democrat, of trying to hurt his chances of winning re-election.""This is Political Persecution and Election Interference at the highest level in history,"" he said in a statement.Shortly after, Trump appealed to supporters to provide money for a legal defense. He has raised over $2 million, according to his campaign, since he incorrectly predicted on March 18 that he would be arrested four days later.The charges will likely be unsealed by a judge in the coming days. Trump will have to travel to Manhattan for fingerprinting and other processing at that point.Bragg's office said it had contacted Trump's attorney to coordinate a surrender, which a court official said would likely occur next Tuesday.Trump's lawyers Susan Necheles and Joseph Tacopina said they will ""vigorously fight"" the charges.The Manhattan investigation is one of several legal challenges facing Trump.The charges could hurt his presidential comeback attempt, as the mug shot from his arraignment and any visuals from his courtroom appearances could provide fodder for rivals.Trump could use the case to stoke anger among his core supporters, though other Republican voters might tire of the drama.Some 44% of Republicans said he should drop out of the race if he is indicted, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released last week.Trump's allies and fellow Republicans blasted the indictment as politically motivated, while Democrats said he is not immune from the rule of law.The White House declined to comment.Outside the courthouse, several protesters silently held signs criticizing Trump. Authorities bolstered security around the courthouse after Trump called for nationwide protests on March 18, recalling his charged rhetoric ahead of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.HUSH MONEYDaniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, has said she received money in exchange for keeping silent about a sexual encounter she had with Trump in 2006.The former president's personal lawyer Michael Cohen has said he coordinated with Trump on the payments to Daniels and to a second woman, former Playboy model Karen McDougal, who also said she had a sexual relationship with him. Trump has denied having affairs with either woman.Trump in 2018 initially disputed knowing anything about the payment to Daniels. He later acknowledged reimbursing Cohen for the payment, which he called a ""simple private transaction.""""No one is above the law,"" Daniels' lawyer Clark Brewster said on Twitter.Cohen pleaded guilty to a campaign-finance violation in 2018 and served more than a year in prison. Federal prosecutors said he acted at Trump's direction.Cohen said he stood by his testimony and the evidence he provided to prosecutors. ""Accountability matters,"" he said in a statement.No former or sitting U.S. president has ever faced criminal charges.Bragg's office last year won the criminal conviction of the businessman-turned-politician's real estate company for tax fraud.Trump also faces two criminal investigations by a special counsel appointed by U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland and one by a local prosecutor in Georgia.Trump has escaped legal peril numerous times. In the White House, he weathered two attempts by Congress to remove him from office, including for the Jan. 6, assault on the U.S. Capitol by his supporters, as well as a years-long probe into his campaign's contacts with Russia in 2016.In last year's tax-fraud case, Bragg targeted Trump's business but declined to charge Trump himself with financial crimes, prompting two prosecutors who worked on the probe to resign.In the hush-money case, legal experts say that Bragg might have to rely on untested legal theories to argue Trump falsified business records to cover up other crimes, such as violating federal campaign-finance law.Trump leads his early rivals for his party's nomination, holding the support of 44% of Republicans in a March Reuters/Ipsos poll, compared with 30% support for his nearest rival, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who has yet to announce his candidacy. President Joe Biden is expected to seek re-election.(Reporting by Luc Cohen and Karen Freifeld, additional reporting by Reuters bureaus, writing by Andy Sullivan; Editing by Scott Malone, Will Dunham, Noeleen Walder, Daniel Wallis, Cynthia Osterman and Lincoln Feast.)Senior Republicans in Congress rallied behind former President Donald Trump after he was indicted by a Manhattan grand jury investigating hush money payments to a porn star, calling the charges a weaponization of the justice system by Democrats.Republicans' ferocious response to the indictment on Thursday reflected the grip Trump still holds on the party and many of its voters as he seeks a return to the White House in the 2024 election.Kevin McCarthy, the Republican speaker of the House of Representatives, said the indictment ""weaponized our sacred system of justice"" against Trump.Elise Stefanik, another member of the Republican House leadership, called the indictment a ""political witch hunt and a dark day for America"".Rick Scott, a U.S. senator from Florida, called the indictment a ""political vendetta against President Trump"", while fellow Republican Senator Ted Cruz from Texas called it ""a catastrophic escalation in the weaponization of the justice system.""Trump called the indictment a ""political persecution.""He primed Republicans to react by declaring last week that he was going to be indicted over alleged payments to the adult film star Stormy Daniels. In the past week, according to Trump's campaign, he raised nearly $2 million.Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, has said she received the money in exchange for keeping silent about a sexual encounter she had with Trump in 2006. Trump has denied the allegations.Trump is the front-runner in the 2024 Republican field, with the support of 44% of Republicans in a Reuters/Ipsos poll completed on Monday, ahead of Florida Governor Ron DeSantis' 30% support.But the indictment also poses perils for Trump as he seeks re-election.DeSantis, Trump's closest rival for the nomination, has not yet officially declared his 2024 run. He is making a lack of personal controversy a plank of his nascent campaign. Opinion polls suggest many Republican voters are seeking an alternative to Trump.DeSantis on Thursday did not mention details of the case but joined Republican condemnation of the indictment, calling it on Twitter ""un-American"" and ""the weaponization of the legal system to advance a political agenda.""On March 20, DeSantis made a veiled attack on Trump by saying: ""I don't know what goes into paying hush money to a porn star to secure silence over some type of alleged affair."" The comment drew criticism from Trump loyalists.Democrats in the House also weighed in. Ted Lieu, a House Democrat, called the indictment a ""horrible precedent"" but necessary if Trump committed crimes.Jamaal Bowman, a fellow House Democrat, said: ""It's time we ensure Trump is banned from running for any public office again.""(Reporting by Tim Reid; editing by Ross Colvin and Cynthia Osterman)",2023/03/31,341,World

The use of advanced technologies will reduce the specific consumption of electricity by 25% and lower dust emissions by 90% while also reducing the operating costs involved in pumping tailings and returning water to the production process.   ""What defines leadership in the mining and metals industry today is using not only advanced production technologies but also environmentally friendly technologies"", said Metalloinvest CEO Nazim Efendiyev. ""The construction of a new tailings storage facility signals a qualitative transition to a new level of environmental safety at LGOK.""   All environmental requirements are being taken into account in the implementation of the project. Public hearings were held, and the project received positive reviews from the State Agency for Environmental Impact Assessment and the Main State Expert Review Board.   Plans for 2023 include the reconstruction of the thickening and circulating water supply system, site preparation for the tailings dam bed and the construction of bund walls, and preparation of the foundations for the main slurry pipelines. The construction of substations and a building for the preparation of reagents for water purification will also get under way.   The first start-up complex for the tailings dam is expected to begin operating in 2026. The project is expected to be fully operational by the end of 2028.   The new site will receive up to 20 million cubic metres of tailings annually.   Upon commissioning of the new tailings storage facility, the existing site will undergo reclamation.   Advanced technologies will be used to achieve a radical reduction in environmental impact. Anti-filtration screens will be installed at the bottom of the storage facility and the base of the dams to prevent the ingress of process water into the aquifers. Instruments will be used to monitor the condition of hydraulic structures. Protective dams up to 30 metres high will be built, with subsequent levels 5 metres high to be added later.   As part of the project, clarified water will be returned to the processing plant to be used in the production process.   The reconstruction of the thickening unit and the optimisation of the water-slurry system will enable a reduction in the specific consumption of electricity. Starting from 2026, the reconstruction of eight 50-metre and three 100-metre thickeners will reduce the operating costs involved in pumping tailings and returning water.  Hashtag: #Metalloinvest

(AP) — The majority-white and Republican-led Mississippi Legislature is taking final steps to expand the the territory of a state-run police department inside the capital city of Jackson, which is majority-Black and governed by Democrats.Critics say the proposal would stomp on local self-governance and create unequal systems of justice in different parts Jackson, which has the highest percentage of Black residents of any major U.S. city.Supporters say they are trying to reduce crime in a city of about 150,000 residents, which had more than 100 homicides for each of the past three years.Senators on Thursday passed the final version of a bill that Democratic Sen. John Horhn of Jackson called “toxic,"" with 31 Republicans voting yes and 15 Democrats voting no.The House is expected to pass the bill Friday and send it to Republican Gov. Tate Reeves. He has not said whether he will sign it, but he has often said Jackson has a crime problem.Most Republicans left the Senate chamber during the debate Thursday, leaving Democrats to give speeches to a room chamber full of empty chairs.Democratic Sen. Barbara Blackmon of Canton, who is Black, compared the proposal to laws that racist white people enacted to suppress Black people after Reconstruction.“It's essentially (creating) a police state right here in the city of Jackson,” Blackmon said.Republican Sen. Brice Wiggins of Pascagoula, who is white, said moments later that Blackmon is good at making headline-grabbing statements that unfairly portray Mississippi as hostile.“This is not about race,” Wiggins said. “This has truly been about helping the citizens of Jackson in a time of need.”The proposal for state control has angered Jackson residents who don’t want their voices diminished in local government, and it is the latest example of the long-running tensions between the Republican-run state government and the Democratic-run capital city.The plan would create a temporary court within a Capitol Complex Improvement District inside a portion of Jackson. The judge would not be required to live in Jackson and would be appointed by the Mississippi Supreme Court chief justice. The current chief justice is a conservative white man.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851955,No decision for deGrom in rough Rangers debut vs Phillies,"ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) — Jacob deGrom had a rough debut for the Texas Rangers, who bailed out their prized acquisition with a big comeback.The two-time National League Cy Young Award winner, who signed a $185 million, five-year contract in December, struck out the first batter he faced on three pitches Thursday and finished with seven strikeouts.But while he was throwing plenty of strikes, as he did during nine outstanding seasons with the New York Mets, the right-hander gave up five runs and six extra-base hits over 3 2/3 innings against the NL champion Philadelphia Phillies in the season opener before the Rangers rallied for an 11-7 victory.“I didn’t make some pitches when I needed to. Obviously, I’m not thrilled with how I threw the ball, but, you know, the guys did a good job there in the bottom of the fourth,” deGrom said. “My outing, I’m not thrilled with, didn’t make pitches when I needed to. But the most important thing is we got to win.”After deGrom allowed six extra-base hits for the first time in his career, and not long after he exited the game, the Rangers responded with a nine-run fourth — matching their highest-scoring inning in a season opener.Robbie Grossman, whose three-run homer in the middle of that rally tied the game at 5, was asked afterward how many times it would be deGrom picking up the Rangers.""A lot. A lot,"" said Grossman, also a newcomer to Texas.DeGrom threw seven of his 10 pitches for strikes in a 1-2-3 first inning that had the sellout crowd in a frenzy. Trea Turner, hitting leadoff in his Phillies debut, started the game by fouling off a 99.6 mph fastball from deGrom, then swung and missed at the next two pitches.But the Phillies went ahead when Alec Bohm hit a two-run homer on a 99 mph fastball in the second inning. Brandon Marsh and Turner, starting a $300 million, 11-year contract, had back-to-back triples in the third before J.T. Realmuto's RBI double made it 4-0.Marsh's triple came on a grounder down the right-field line that ricocheted off the netting in foul territory. Turner then hit a grounder just inside first base that rolled into the corner, and Realmuto hit a slider that was off the plate.“He had some bad luck,” new Rangers manager Bruce Bochy said of deGrom, who had been expected to go about 65 pitches.He threw 49 of his 73 pitches for strikes and didn't walk a batter.“I felt good. I honestly felt like I could have kept going,” deGrom said. “I think it's pretty close to being full go.”It was deGrom's fourth career start on opening day, and the first one in which he allowed a run. He had tossed 17 scoreless innings with 25 strikeouts in his three openers for the Mets, the last one two years ago against the Phillies.While deGrom is now pitching in the American League, the opening opponent was familiar to him, having started 20 previous games against the Phillies. He entered 9-1 with a 2.18 ERA and 136 strikeouts over 120 innings against them.The Rangers were very cautious with deGrom after he reported tightness in his left side just before the team’s first official spring training workout on Feb. 15. He struck out 10 over 6 2/3 scoreless innings in his only two exhibition games in Arizona, which came after throwing batting practice and in a minor league game.DeGrom didn’t make his first big league start last year until Aug. 2, and he was 5-4 with a 3.08 ERA in 11 regular-season games before winning a wild-card game for the Mets. He had a career-low 1.08 ERA over 92 innings in 2021 before missing the final three months with right forearm tightness and a sprained elbow, then was shut down late in spring training last year because of a stress reaction in his right scapula.___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/31,,World

(AP) — A Massachusetts man has been indicted in the death of his wife who has not been seen since Jan. 1, a top prosecutor said Thursday.Norfolk District Attorney Michael Morrisey said Brian Walshe, 47, has been charged with first-degree murder as well as misleading a police investigation/obstruction of justice and improper conveyance of a human body. A first-degree murder conviction in Massachusetts carries a mandatory sentence of life in prison without parole.Walshe is accused of murdering his wife, dismembering her and disposing of her body.Ana Walshe, a mother of three who is originally from Serbia, was reportedly last seen leaving the family’s home in Cohasset, south of Boston, in the early morning hours of Jan. 1. She was on her way to the airport for a flight to Washington, where she worked for a real estate company, authorities said. Her employer reported her missing Jan. 4.Starting Jan. 1 and for several days after, Brian Walshe made multiple online searches using an iPad belonging to one of his sons using terms such as “dismemberment and best ways to dispose of a body,” “how long before a body starts to smell” and “hacksaw best tool to dismember,” prosecutors said.Investigators also found Jan. 3 surveillance video of man resembling Brian Walshe throwing what appeared to be heavy trash bags into a dumpster at an apartment complex in Abington, not far from Cohasset.During a Jan. 8 search of a trash processing facility north of Boston and not far from Brian Walshe’s mother’s home, investigators found trash bags that contained a hatchet, hacksaw, towels and a protective Tyvek suit, cleaning agents, a Prada purse, boots like the ones Ana Walshe was last seen wearing and a COVID-19 vaccination card with her name.Walshe was charged with murder in January and pleaded not guilty. The indictment moves the case to Norfolk Superior Court, and he will be arraigned in the coming weeks, Morrisey said. Walshe remains in jail. He and his wife's three young children are now in state custody.",2023/03/31,,World

The Rockies filled his spot by calling up right-hander Jake Bird.Bard said he has had anxiety both on and off the field.“From my experience, knowing myself, I think just taking a step back, taking time to work through things, get it right, is the best approach,” he said. Bard added that it was a hard thing to admit and thanked the Rockies for their understanding. There is no timeline for his return.The 37-year-old is heading into his fourth season with the Rockies. He was their main closer the last two years, recording 20 saves in 2021 and 34 saves last year.He signed as a free agent with the Rockies prior to the 2020 season after missing the previous seven years after experiencing severe control issues. Those control issues resurfaced during the recent World Baseball Classic, when he had a 43.20 ERA in three appearances for the U.S.. He allowed eight runs, five hits and four walks in 1 2/3 innings.Bard was a first-round draft pick of the Boston Red Sox in the 2006 amateur draft and made his big league debut in 2009.___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/31,,World

The show opened with an array of neutrals, subtly transitioning to forest green before giving way to a blaze of bright colors and patterns. Throughout it all, most of the models sported strings of pearls wound around their necks.“I personally wanted to celebrate and showcase the incredible knowledge India offers to the international world of fashion in the field of embroidery, the mastery of the artisans who continue to work on this craft, and the commitment of Chanakya’s founders to preserving India’s history and culture, portrayed by each embroidery technique,” Chiuri said in an Instagram post.Dior has had a long association with India through the Mumbai-based atelier Chanakya, which works with artisans and underprivileged women. The show brought the spotlight back on India’s luxury fashion market where major Western fashion brands like Pierre Cardin, Yves Saint Laurent and Valentino have presented their collections in the past.India, now the world’s fifth-largest economy, has always been known for its intricate embroidery art, opulent textiles and embellishments. With a young and aspirational middle class that has easy access to internet — and a rising number of uber-rich — it is fast emerging as a key consumer market for international fashion labels.Many Indian designers have also opened stores in the global fashion capitals like New York and Dubai and have been showcasing their collections during international fashion weeks.To flesh out the guest list, Dior drew on a range of A-list invitees from India and elsewhere. Bollywood actors in attendance included the legendary Rekha, fashion icon Sonam Kapoor Ahuja and Anushka Sharma, accompanied by her husband, Indian cricketer Virat Kohli.Western celebrities of Indian origin or descent — like Freida Pinto, Simone Ashley of “Bridgerton”, sitarist Anoushka Shankar and Vanity Fair editor-in-chief Radhika Jones — took in the show.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851964,"Jarry stops 27 shots, Penguins edge Saros, Predators 2-0","PITTSBURGH (AP) — Tristan Jarry typically speaks in a monotone, symbolic of a goaltender who when he's at his best takes a boring, almost zen-like approach to his job.It was telling earlier this week, however, when the two-time All-Star for the Pittsburgh Penguins took exception when asked if he was worried he has become injury prone after three months of health issues and erratic play.Jarry's terse reply — that he has been durable most of his four full seasons in the NHL — was a little out of character. It also, however, revealed an edge that lies just underneath the surface.It's an edge the Penguins need down the stretch. It's one he provided in a 2-0 victory over Nashville on Thursday night that preserved Pittsburgh's tenuous grasp on the second wild-card spot in the Eastern Conference.Steady at the start and stoic at the finish, Jarry turned aside all 27 shots he faced while posting his 13th career shutout as the Penguins remained one point in front of Florida for the final playoff berth in the East. Pittsburgh has seven games remaining. The Panthers have six.Jarry pointed to a week on the bench facilitated by a minor lower-body injury and solid play by backup Case DeSmith as a chance to hit the reset button and focus on his craft.“Any time you can get away from it a little bit, it takes a little stress off you and you’re able to just prepare your game and kind of work on the things you need to in practice,” Jarry said.Jarry certainly looked prepared in his 200th NHL appearance while outdueling Nashville's Jusse Saros. Saros was spectacular at times while making 43 saves. It just wasn't enough for the injury-depleted Predators to bookend a stirring upset over NHL-leading Boston on Tuesday.“It was a tough night for us,” Nashville coach John Hynes said. ""Credit Pittsburgh, they put pressure on us. ... We didn’t test Jarry a lot, but we did get some good looks and he made some big saves for them.”Jason Zucker scored his 26th goal in the second period to give Jarry all the help he would need. Jake Guentzel provided some breathing room with a power-play goal in the later stages of the third period.Saros has been one of the reasons Nashville remains in the mix for the final playoff berth in the Western Conference even after a sell-off at the trade deadline. The Predators are stockpiling picks gearing for the future while playing without stars Filip Forsberg and Roman Josi, among others.It's not that way in Pittsburgh, which is still trying to prop the Stanley Cup window open a little longer for Sidney Crosby, Evgeni Malkin and Kris Letang. The core of a franchise that has reached the postseason 16 straight years hardly looks like they're slowing down. It's nearly everywhere else — including depth scoring and goaltending — that has the Penguins sweating out a shot at the playoffs.Zucker, Pittsburgh's most consistently emotionally engaged player this season, finally broke through in the later stages of the second period, though his 26th goal was also among his easiest.Instead, it was the unlikely hands of Dumoulin who did most of the work. Not exactly known for his offensive ability, Dumoulin sprinted down the slot and took a pass from Evgeni Malkin before dangling the puck around a sliding Predator and slipping a pass to Zucker at the doorstep. Zucker tapped it in to give the Penguins the lead.“I trusted it the whole time,” Zucker said with a laugh. ""I knew he was going to go toe drag, back door tap in. I told him I was just waiting for it.”Pittsburgh has struggled at times of late when ahead in the third period. Not this time. Jarry's stop on Philip Tomasino marked the last legitimate threat by the Predators and when Guentzel redirected a nice pass from Rickard Rakell by Saros with 6:57 remaining, the Penguins were on their way to preserving their slim advantage in the wild-card race.UP NEXTPredators: Welcome St. Louis to Bridgestone Arena on Saturday.Penguins: Host the NHL-leading Boston Bruins on Saturday.___AP NHL: https://www.apnews.com/hub/NHL and https://www.twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/31,,World

Erik Cernak added a short-handed, empty-net goal with 1:54 remaining.Andrei Vasilevskiy made 30 saves for the Lightning, who’ve won back-to-back games after losing four in a row.“If we defend and play the right way, we win,” Maroon said. “You’ve seen it the past few years. We’re playing smarter with the puck too. We know better and we know what it takes. We’re too good of a hockey team and we have too many veterans in here to struggle like we have.”Craig Smith scored and Darcy Kuemper, playing for the second straight night, made 29 saves for the Capitals. They are 1-4-2 in their past seven games and fell seven points behind the Pittsburgh Penguins for the second wild-card playoff berth in the Eastern Conference.“No one here is giving up,” Smith said. “There’s no quit here.”Tampa Bay opened the scoring 9:20 into the first period when Killorn tipped Mikhail Sergachev’s power-play wrist shot from the left point past Kuemper. Stamkos put the Lightning up 2-0 by beating Kuemper with a one-timer after a faceoff win by Pierre-Edouard Bellemare.The Capitals picked up their play in the second period and got on the board with 3:50 left when Smith picked up a missed shot off the end boards and backhanded it off Vasilevskiy’s left skate and over the goal line.“Our first period was tough. That wasn’t the way we wanted to start,” Capitals coach Peter Laviolette said. “We had a much better second period and gave ourselves a chance going into the third, but the start was no good. We weren’t quick enough.”Maroon tapped in the rebound of Anthony Cirelli’s shot 4:30 into the third period to restore the Lightning’s two-goal lead, then banged home another rebound off Cirelli’s shot.Lightning coach Jon Cooper was delighted to see his fourth line produce a couple of gritty goals.“Anytime you’re getting those goals two feet from the net, you’re doing something right and putting yourself in the right area,” he said. “It’s good for Patty to get a couple there.”With the playoffs approaching, Cirelli said focusing on hard work and defense is key.“Obviously, we want to be a hard team to play against. We want to limit chances and opportunities, especially 5-on-5 chances,” he said. “We’ve been great over the past few games, and we have to keep building on that. We have to continue to eliminate chances and play great team defense. We have to bring it up to another level.”Capitals forward T.J. Oshie left the game after the first period with an upper-body injury and did not return.NOTES: Washington’s Alex Ovechkin, whose 50 goals in 78 career games against the Lightning are the most he’s scored against any team, was limited to two shots on goal and was minus-3 but had a career-high 11 hits. … The Capitals fell to 2-7-1 in the second game of back-to-back sets. … The victory was Vasilevskiy’s 221st since the start of the 2017-18 season, by far the most in the NHL; Connor Hellebuyck of the Winnipeg Jets is second with 194.UP NEXTCapitals: Host the New York Rangers on Sunday.Lightning: Host the New York Islanders on Saturday night.___AP NHL: https://www.apnews.com/hub/NHL and https://www.twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/31,,World

If the Devils overtook Carolina, they would not face the Rangers in the opening round.“Both teams know the standing situation and the rivalry,” Meier said. “So that’s a bit of a playoff-type game, the way you feel and also the pace and the physicality. Those games are fun and you can be be excited about the win but also know that there’s some big task ahead.”Vanecek finished with 24 saves as he stopped Vincent Trocheck in close twice and Vladimir Tarasenko in the final 12 minutes in picking up his 30th win.“Defensively it was a huge game for us and feel like we’re getting ready for the playoffs and it’s huge for us,” said Vanecek, who also got help from defenseman Ryan Graves.Graves cleared a loose puck in the crease with Tarasenko lurking in the final minute.“It’s just a split-second decision,” Graves said. ""I’m just happy I didn’t hit it into my own net. It was pretty close.”Chris Kreider scored his 33rd goal for the Rangers, who lost for the third time in 11 games (8-2-1). Igor Shesterkin maintained his outstanding play, making 29 saves before a sellout crowd at the Prudential Center that rooted for both teams.“That was a good hockey game, two really good teams, 2-1 score,” Rangers coach Gerard Gallant said.There was a lot of anticipation about this game with the teams so close in the standings. While the fans were loud, the game didn't pick up a playoff feeling until the latter part of the second period.There was a scrum to the side of the Rangers' net after Haula gave Adam Fox a forecheck in the back after a whistle, and there was another behind the Devils' net after the period ended.The Devils took a 2-0 lead in the first period.Haula scored his second in as many games, redirecting a blue-line pass by Dougie Hamilton past Shesterkin at 5:17. Meier got his 36th of the season from the slot on a power play at 17:03 on a pass by Jack Hughes.“You can’t let up goals early.

The Celtics (53-24) shot 22 of 43 from 3-point range and moved within two games of the Bucks (55-22).“It does matter,” Brown said about the possibility of earning the No. 1 seed. “We want to finish out the season strong and see what happens.”Boston won the season series with the Bucks 2-1, which would give the Celtics the tiebreaker if both teams finish with the same record. Boston beat the Bucks in seven games in last season’s East semifinals.The Celtics trounced the Bucks 139-118 in Boston on Christmas Day and lost 131-125 in overtime on Feb. 14. The Celtics didn’t play Brown, Tatum, Marcus Smart or Al Horford in that overtime loss.Boston's players downplayed the notion that their lopsided victory would send any sort of message to the Bucks in case they meet again in the postseason. They noted the Bucks were playing for a second straight night and shot just 37.6%, well below their norms.“This don’t really mean much,” Brown said. “If we play them again, we’ve got to be ready to take their best shot.”The Bucks didn't provide anything close to their best shot Thursday.“We know what the deal is,” said Giannis Antetokounmpo, who led the Bucks with 24 points. “If you’re not focused and you don’t play hard, they are going to kick our (butt). Simple as that. There is no level of concern. It’s a fact. If we play the same way, we’ll have the same outcome. We’ve got to have some pride.”Milwaukee took a hit on the floor as well as in the standings. Bucks forward Khris Middleton left midway through the third quarter after taking an elbow to the face from Brown, who was called for charging. Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said after the game that Middleton got “three or four stitches” on his upper lip.Boston built a 114-74 lead through three periods, causing most of the starters for both teams to sit out the entire fourth quarter.The Bucks were playing one night after a 149-136 victory at Indiana in which they shot a season-high 62.4% from the floor with Jrue Holiday scoring 51 points and Antetokounmpo having 38 points, 17 rebounds and 12 assists. This marked the first time an NBA team had one player score at least 50 points and another have a triple-double with at least 35 points in the same game.Milwaukee found the going quite a bit tougher Thursday.Antetokounmpo shot just 11 of 27, including 0 for 5 from 3-point range. Holiday started his night by sinking a 3-pointer, but went 1 of 7 the rest of the way and finished with just six points.After the first 8½ minutes of the game featured nine lead changes and five ties, the Celtics seized control by going on a 29-9 over the last seven-plus minutes. Boston capped that spurt by scoring 13 straight points.Boston didn't let up the rest of the night as the Celtics shot 56% and bounced back from a 130-111 loss at Washington two nights earlier.“We responded well from the jump,” Tatum said. “That's all that I wanted and we wanted as a team, regardless of if we won or not, just to respond and play better than we did last game.”TIP-INSCeltics: Boston outscored Milwaukee 41-21 in the second period and matched its highest second-quarter point total of the season. ...

Buck Rodgers was previously the youngest Angels catcher to start an opener at 23 years, 237 days old in 1962.O'Hoppe also became the first rookie catcher to start on opening day for the Angels since Bengie Molina in 2000.“He got his size from me,” cracked his overjoyed father, who already beat the odds by surviving non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma in 2021 after doctors gave him less than a year to live.Michael watched intently from the warning track dirt behind the cage as Logan took his pregame cuts.His family and close friends were thrilled and overcome with emotion. Hard to imagine it all happening, let alone this soon for the 23rd-round draft pick — 677th overall — out of Saint John the Baptist in West Islip, New York, on Long Island.Angels manager Phil Nevin asked O'Hoppe to grab his phone so they could call Michael — he was working and didn't take the video call — with the news, and once the family found out they immediately made plans to get to the Bay Area. And what amazing timing: O'Hoppe's twin sister, Mel, begins a new job in Southern California on Monday, so father and daughter will drive down this weekend.“I can't believe it,"" Logan O'Hoppe said. “It's crazy.”Then he was off to the first of several pregame meetings, including one with Ohtani.What a debut.___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/31,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851976,China SCE Group Stayed Resilient in 2022 with Robust Financial Performance,"Profit Attributable to Owners of the Parent Amounted to RMB24.5 Million
HONG KONG SAR -  Media OutReach - 31 March 2023 -  China SCE Group Holdings Limited (""China SCE"" or the  ""Company"", together with its subsidiaries, the  ""Group"", HKEX Stock Code: 1966), an integrated property developer in China, announced its audited annual results for the year ended 31st December 2022 (the ""Year"").   Over the past year, in the face of industry risks and the impact of the pandemic, the confidence of domestic property purchasers has plummeted, dealing a blow to contracted sales. During the year, the Group recorded a contracted sales amount of approximately RMB59.023 billion, with a contracted sales area of approximately 4.91 million sq.m. The average selling price was RMB12,016 per sq.m. The Group together with its joint ventures and associates had an aggregate of over 120 projects for sale in over 50 cities, mainly in second-tier cities and core areas of high potential in third- and fourth-tier cities. As a result of the popular sales of Woven City in Hangzhou and the launch of a number of new properties by the Group in the Yangtze River Delta Economic Zone, this region has accounted for the largest share of contracted sales of the Group together with its joint ventures and associates, amounting to RMB24.609 billion or approximately 41.7% in 2022.   Balanced Land Bank and Liquidity While Maintaining a Record of ""No Breach of Contract""   During the Year, the Group recorded a revenue of RMB26.71 billion and a profit attributable to owners of the parent of RMB24.5 million. The financial position remained robust and maintained a record of ""no breach of contract"". The Group has also successfully implemented financing strategies to optimize the capital structure. Since December 2022, the Group has successively signed strategic cooperation agreements with several commercial banks to provide necessary financing services for the Group, receiving more than RMB43 billion in loans. In addition, benefited from national policies, the Group became one of the first private real estate enterprises backed by China Bond Insurance Co., Ltd. (""CBIC"") in 2023 and successfully issued bonds, which was a mark of the confidence of both investors and regulators in the Group's development. The Group will keep communicating with financial institutions and stepping up its efforts to secure financing guarantee from CBIC and bond issue, so as to ease the pressure on cash flows through various channels.   As a result of the continued sluggish contracted sales of commodity house and difficulties in financing in the capital market, the Group suspended land acquisition in 2022 in order to maintain sufficient liquidity. Nevertheless, the Group together with its joint ventures and associates had a land bank with an aggregate planned GFA of approximately 33.87 million sq.m as of 31st December 2022, which is expected to be available for the Group's development in the next two to three years.   Going forward, as the central government optimizes and adjusts real estate policies, the industry is poised to adopt a new development model. The Group will be committed to raising the operational safety margin, building a commercial business driven by cash flow and operational quality in order to maintain a solid financial foundation. At the same time, the Group will develop its asset management model, lower its reliance on financing, increase synergy with the property industry, as well as strengthen the symbiotic operational model with Funworld.  Mr. Wong Chiu Yeung, Chairman and CEO of China SCE Group, said, ""Looking ahead, the Group will continue to adhere to the 'Dual Track' synergistic development strategy and strengthen the synergy between shopping malls and rental apartments with residential development, concentrating on core cities and dominant regions. We will focus on our market, our clients and our products. The Group will also take heed of clients' needs and attach greater importance to product research and development with the aim of further expanding its differentiated competitiveness to create greater value.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851996,The Anti-Bribery Advisory Service (ABAS) Center set up to provide guidelines to the private sector about giving bribes to government officials,"BANGKOK THAILAND -  Media OutReach - 31 March 2023 - Thailand has set up an anti-bribery service centre to provide knowledge and guidelines to the private sector concerning the laws on offering bribes to government officials.   The establishment of Anti-Bribery Advisory Service (ABAS) Center, which falls under the supervision of the National Anti-Corruption Commission (NACC), is part of Thailand's attempts to level up its Corruption Perception Index (CPI), Niwatchai Kasemmongkol, NACC's secretary general said in a recent exclusive interview.   Thailand ranks 101 of 180 countries and scored 42 out of 100 on the CPI in 2022.   The ABAS Center was established to provide academic advice, knowledge, and guidelines to the private sector about offering bribes to government officials. Using the guidelines, the private sector could put appropriate and effective anti-bribery measures in place, he said.   Thailand has ratified and become a member of the UN Convention against Corruption (UNCAC), and OECD's Convention on Combating Foreign Bribery in International Business Transactions.   NACC also has rules for prosecuting private sector firms involved in bribing government officials and those working in international agencies. The rules have been issued to make private sector firms aware that they could be prosecuted if they are involved in corruption.   Our rules and regulations as well as ABAS are set up in line with and as required by the UNCAC and OECD, he said.   Thailand will soon hold a general election and have a new government in the near future and Niwatchai said he hoped they would be serious about suppression corruption.   If the new government and policy makers are serious, the country's CPI will certainly go up. He cited as an example Vietnam, whose CPI was 77 in 2022, saying its CPI is higher than that of Thailand's as its leaders are serious about prosecuting those involved in corruption.   He added educational institutes should play an important role in instilling and teaching people about honesty.   The situation concerning corrupt practices by those in the political circle, government agencies, and the private sector are still worrisome, he adds.   With corruption rampant in the country, the NACC needs the participation of the public and government officials who witness corruption. We would not know about corruption if they do not inform us by filing complaints with us, he said.   In the past, junior government officials who acted as whistleblowers on malfeasance in their units might not feel safe and could be persecuted by their superiors.   Today we have an organic law on prevention and suppression on misconduct. The Act, B.E 2561 (2018), stipulates several measures to protect such whistleblowers.   In a case where a junior official is involved in the corruption but decides to report the wrongdoings, he or she would not face either criminal or disciplinary charges and would be treated as a witness. A whistleblower can also be rewarded, Niwatchai said.   If necessary, NACC's protection programme is ready to give protection to the official and his/her family. Such protection would include allowances, name change, and relocation.   The protection measures are aimed to create confidence and bravery in a whistleblower who reports graft. However, he/she could be prosecuted if he/she fails to meet the conditions or changes his/her testimony.   Niwatchai cited the manipulation of the district chief examinations in 2009 as an example of the NACC's investigation and provision of protection for whistleblowers.   In 2009, the investigation and collection of evidence showed that violations were happening in the selection process. At first, no official dared to testify against any senior government official but eventually ten examinees agreed to do so.   Their testimonies led to the jailing of the then director general of the Provincial Administration Department and senior officials.   However the bureaucratic system had frozen the careers of the ten examinees, their levels were not raised, their salaries were put on hold and they were not allowed to take the district chief exam again.   NACC then reported this to the prime minister which resulted in the Office of Civil Service Commission resolving to promote them to the position of district chief, Niwatchai said.   Responding to a statement that only small fish are arrested in corruption cases, Niwatchai pointed out that small fish are easily caught but catching the big fish needs time and good bait as well as participation from all sides.   He revealed there was a case where the NACC found two politicians committing ethical misconduct as political position holders and the cases went to court, which ruled against them. They were then removed from their positions.   He also talked about NACC's investigation into the alleged massive corruption in the National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation Department, saying the arrest of the most senior official was the result of cooperation between many agencies.   The laws today are severe and we have caught not only small but also big fish. However, NACC do not hold a press conference to announce the arrests and in the future, NACC is planning to reveal the progress of its investigation to the public.   This will allow the complainant, the public, and other parties to jointly examine the NACC's work.   He also mentioned the criticism that the National Parks department that is under the NACC's probe had obtained a high score of 85 marks and Grade A in NACC's Integrity and Transparency Assessment (ITA).   ITA is just a preliminary framework assessment of three aspects of work conducted by both insiders and outsiders who use the service and disclose information on issues such as procurement.   ------------------------   The National Anti-Corruption Commission (NACC) is a constitutional independent organization and supervised by nine commissioners selected from various professions. It is authorised to undertake work on the prevention and suppression of malfeasance, particularly in government agencies, on assets investigations, as well as on the monitoring of ethics and virtues of political position holders.           It has the authority to file charges in court as well as support and build up awareness of the penalties for committing corruption. The NACC is supervised by the NACC Board and has the Office of the NACC as its administrative agency.    Since 1997, Thai Courts have ruled against and punished politicians, former ministers, high-ranking government officials as well as executives of the private sector in the thousands of cases submitted by the NACC.

(AP) — Mi Hyang Lee shot a 6-under 65 in her first LPGA Tour event of the year for a one-stroke lead in the opening round of the DIO Implant LA Open on Thursday.Lee, a South Korean who earned her spot in a Monday qualifier, hit all 18 greens in regulation, played bogey-free and closed with a birdie on the par-4 18th hole in challenging conditions at Palos Verdes. Players endured intermitted rain and hail with temperatures in the 40s.Lee turned 30 on Thursday and called it “the best birthday round I've ever had.”Lee, ranked 378th in the world, has two career LPGA Tour victories, the more recent at the Ladies Scottish Open in 2017. She was runner-up at the ANA Inspiration, a major, in 2019 to reach a career-best 31st in the ranking but has struggled the past three years. She's coming off a tie for sixth in an Epson Tour event last week.Megan Khang and Hyo Joo Kim — a close friend of Lee's — each shot 66. Nasa Hataoka, Lucy Li and Maude-Aimee LeBlanc were another shot behind.“You know, I’ve come pretty close here and there,” said Khang, winless in eight years on the LPGA Tour. “I tell myself the more I give myself chances and opportunities the easier — quote-unquote — easier it’s going to get in those situations and trying to get my foot through the door. ... I know I’m capable of doing it and it’s just a matter of time.”Second-ranked Nelly Korda and her sister, Jessica, were among the group at 3 under.This is the fifth playing of the LA Open and the first at Palos Verdes, which hosted a different event, the Palos Verdes Championship, last year — won by Marina Alex, who shot a 1-over 72 on Thursday.___AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852004,Tkachuk has hat trick in Panthers' 5-2 win over Canadiens,"MONTREAL (AP) — Matthew Tkachuk had his fifth career hat trick and one assist to lead the Florida Panthers to a 5-2 victory over the Montreal Canadiens on Thursday night.With his second goal, Tkachuk became the fourth player in NHL history to have 100 or more points in consecutive seasons after changing teams in the offseason. He joined Wayne Gretzky (1987-88, 1988-89), Jimmy Carson (1987-88, 1988-89) and Mike Rogers (1980-81, 1981-82) in achieving the feat.“It’s pretty cool, but it’s probably the last time I’ll ever be in the same sentence as (Gretzky),” Tkachuk said. “Very, very cool.”For Florida coach Paul Maurice, Tkachuk is much more than a 100-point contributor.“There’s no cheat in his game,” Maurice said. “Really good players anticipate and then good players cheat. There’s never any of that.“He’s not trying to do things with the puck that are all offense with no understanding of the cost of the defensive game. ... If we could afford the minutes, we would have him kill penalties because he just gets it. He’s just such a bright man on the ice.”Anton Lundell added two goals and one assist and Alex Lyon made 18 saves while helping the Panthers to its second win in a row and a season series sweep of Montreal.With 83 points, the Panthers are one point behind Pittsburgh for the final wild-card spot in the Eastern Conference. The Penguins have one game in hand over Florida.“Being able to get both (wins) was huge and we know where we’re at right now,” Tkachuk said. “We know how important these two points are each and every night.""Sean Farrell scored his first career goal and Rafael Harvey-Pinard had a goal for the Canadiens, who dropped their second in a row. Sam Montembeault made 25 saves.Farrell opened the scoring 1:23 into the first period when the rookie took a shot from along the boards that was mishandled by Lyon and went in.“It was a really cool moment, it’s something I’ll remember for the rest of my life,” Farrell said, adding that teammates Brendan Gallagher and Jake Evans saw it go in before he did. ""I just reacted based off of them, so it was cool to share with those guys.”Lundell tied it at 4:09 with his 11th of the season after Montembeault gave up a rebound off a shot by Tkachuk.Tkachuk finished off a tic-tac-toe sequence with Brandon Montour and Sam Reinhart to give the Panthers a 2-1 edge 3:59 into the second on the power play.Just under two minutes later, Tkachuk scored his second, beating Montembeault with a wrist shot from the right faceoff circle.Tkachuk completed his hat trick with 20 seconds remaining with an empty-net goal.NOTES: The Canadiens announced C Kirby Dach will miss at least one week with an upper-body injury. ...

He knew there was not much time left, so he made a really good pass. Good screen on it.”Hurricanes coach Rod Brind’Amour was disappointed by losing two important points.“That’s brutal — it is a kick in the you-know-where, because we played well enough to win,” Brind’Amour said. “They made a great pass. It was too many men on the ice — he jumped on early — but good on them for pushing the rules a little bit.”Dominik Kubalik and captain Dylan Larkin also scored for the Red Wings and Alex Nedeljkovic made 31 saves to beat his former team.“It’s always special playing against a former team,” Nedeljkovic said. “Not any more excited or more into a zone than if it was anybody else I was playing against. Just more coincidence. I don’t know, I like playing against these guys. They like throwing pucks on net, so sometimes it’s a good stat booster, but it can go south pretty quick if you let it.”Kubalik scored 59 seconds into the game and Larkin connected on a power play at 7:26 of the second. Larkin extended his team leads in goals with 28 and power-play goals with 15.Carolina defense partners Brent Burns and Jaccob Slavin scored 3:36 apart in the second — at 42 seconds and 4:18.“It’s obviously frustrating but I don’t think we lost the game because of the final minute,” Slavin said. “(Nedeljkovic) played well, but we’ve got to get more traffic in front. We had a couple power plays, but we didn’t get good shots.”Hurricanes goalie Frederik Andersen made 19 saves in his first loss against Detroit. He entered the game 10-0-1 against the Red Wings.“It’s a real tough team to play, they just funnel everything to the net,” Detroit coach Derek Lalonde said. “It creates scrambles. It’s really disciplined what they do. It’s really hard to play against. I thought for the most part we defended fairly well. We defended second effort in front of the net fairly well.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852006,Vaughn's double lifts White Sox over Astros 3-2 in opener,"HOUSTON (AP) — With both his shoulders covered in shaving cream from the postgame celebration, Pedro Grifol couldn't stop smiling as he discussed his first win as a major league manager.“Today was a fun day all the way around,” he said.Andrew Vaughn’s tiebreaking, two-run double in the ninth inning lifted the Chicago White Sox to a 3-2 victory over the defending World Series champion Houston Astros in their season opener Thursday night.Grifol won his managerial debut after spending the last 10 seasons as a coach in the Royals organization.It snapped a streak of 10 straight wins for the Astros in openers, which was tied for the longest streak in major league history with the Boston Beaneaters from 1887-96.Yasmani Grandal hit a tying homer for Chicago in the eighth. Ryan Pressly (0-1) walked Tim Anderson with one out in the ninth before a single by Luis Robert Jr.Vaughn then belted a line drive that sailed over the head of leaping second baseman Mauricio Dubón and into center field to put the White Sox on top.“It was a great game all the way around from the first inning to the last inning,"" Grifol said. “There was a lot of moving parts to it, even though it was just three or four moves to make, there was a lot of moving parts in the mind.”White Sox ace Dylan Cease allowed two hits and a run with 10 strikeouts over 6 1/3 innings in his first opening-day start. Kendall Graveman (1-0) worked a scoreless eighth for the win.Reynaldo Lopez allowed a soaring solo home run to the second deck in right field to Yordan Alvarez with one out in the ninth but finished for the save.Cease had retired 19 in a row, with Houston’s only baserunner coming on a leadoff single by Jeremy Peña, when he plunked Alvarez on the foot with one out in the seventh.José Abreu, who spent his entire nine-year career with the White Sox before signing with the Astros this offseason, followed with a single to chase Cease.He was replaced by Aaron Bummer, who walked Kyle Tucker to load the bases. A wild pitch with two outs allowed Alvarez to score, putting Houston up 1-0.Cease, who finished second to Justin Verlander in last year's AL Cy Young Award voting, said he felt locked in from the start.“That was about as sharp as I’ve ever been,” he said.Houston manager Dusty Baker raved about Cease's performance.“You’re not used to seeing breaking balls like that right out of spring training,” he said. “Usually, he would bounce more of them. He was getting strike one with that breaking ball. ... He was on tonight. We usually don’t strike out that much but that guy was pretty good tonight.”Yoán Moncada hit a ball that Abreu couldn’t handle at first base for an error to start the eighth. The ball rolled into right field, but Moncada was thrown out at third. Chicago challenged, but the call was upheld.There were two outs when Grandal connected off Rafael Montero on a shot to the right-center seats.Framber Valdez allowed six hits and struck out four in five scoreless innings in his second straight opening-day start for Houston.The White Sox had chances to score early against Valdez, but he pitched out of trouble. He retired Eloy Jiménez with the bases loaded to end the fifth.The Astros opened the season without star second baseman Jose Altuve, sidelined for at least two months after breaking his right thumb in the World Baseball Classic. Dubón filled in, marking the first time since 2011 that Altuve wasn’t the team’s starting second baseman on opening day.TRAINER’S ROOMWhite Sox: Placed LHP Garrett Crochet (left elbow surgery) and RHPs Matt Foster (right flexor strain) and Liam Hendriks (cancer treatment) on the 15-day injured list, retroactive to March 27.Astros: Placed Altuve and OF Michael Brantley (right shoulder surgery) on the 10-day injured list. RHP Lance McCullers Jr. (right elbow strain), LHP Parker Mushinski (lumbar spine muscle spasm) and LHP Blake Taylor (left elbow strain) were put on the 15-day injured list.CHAMPSIn a pregame ceremony, the Astros unveiled a gold pennant attached to a pole on the left-field wall commemorating their second World Series title in 2022. The ceremony also included team owner Jim Crane and his wife, Whitney, riding into the ballpark on a wagon pulled by Clydesdale horses while the couple held the team’s two World Series trophies.OLD FRIENDSAbreu talked about how strange it was to be facing his former team in his first game with a new club. He spent time on the field before batting practice catching up with many of his former teammates and hugged Grandal at the plate before his first at-bat.The 2020 AL MVP signed a three-year $58.5 million contract with Houston to take over at first base this season for Yuli Gurriel.UP NEXTHouston RHP Cristian Javier opposes RHP Lance Lynn when the series continues Friday night.___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/31,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852009,San Diego County supervisor to resign after assault lawsuit,"SAN DIEGO (AP) — A powerful San Diego County supervisor said he will resign amid accusations that he sexually assaulted a government employee, completing a swift and shocking fall for a decorated Marine combat veteran whose star rose with his Democratic Party’s ascendancy in the nation’s eighth-largest city.Nathan Fletcher, who defected from the Republican Party in 2012, was elected to a second term on the county board of supervisors with 65% of the vote in November, two years after Democrats won a board majority that eluded their grasp for decades.Fletcher, 46, was the face of the San Diego region’s muscular response to COVID-19 at daily news conferences. He became half of San Diego’s most powerful political couple after his 2017 marriage to Lorena Gonzalez Fletcher, a well-known liberal Democratic state assemblywoman who became a top California labor leader last year.Fletcher’s progressive positions and telegenic presence made him a solid favorite to succeed another prominent California politician, Toni Atkins, in the state Senate. But he announced late Sunday that he was dropping his bid after less than two months to seek treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder and alcohol abuse.Days later, Fletcher resigned as chair of the San Diego Metropolitan Transit System after a government staffer alleged sexual harassment and assault in a lawsuit that included screenshots of lurid messages from Fletcher.Hours after that, Fletcher said he would resign from the county board of supervisors, calling the pressure on his family over the last week “immense and unbearable.”“A combination of my personal mistakes plus false accusations has created a burden that my family shouldn’t have to bear,” he said. He will leave office May 15.Fletcher’s fall jolted the city a week after officials made a critical turn in a saga that has captivated the city and threatened other top politicians.A 2017 lease-to-own deal for employees to occupy a 19-story downtown office building turned disastrous after asbestos and other deficiencies were discovered and rendered the space uninhabitable. Jason Hughes, an unpaid adviser to the city on the deal, pleaded guilty last week to a misdemeanor and agreed to repay $9.4 million that he collected in a dual role as adviser to the building’s seller, Cisterra LLC.The deal was bungled under Mayor Kevin Faulconer, one of California’s most promising Republican leaders until a resounding defeat in a failed 2020 recall effort against Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat.Brian Adams, a political science professor at San Diego State University, likened Fletcher to other fallen leaders, including Andrew Cuomo and Eliot Spitzer, both former governors of New York, and former U.S. Sen. John Edwards.“They were all seen having promising futures collapse over sexual harassment claims,” said Adams.Fletcher's name entered conversations about who San Diego might elect to be mayor or a member of Congress, Adams said. His troubles may open the way for new faces if Todd Gloria, the Democratic mayor, faces questions over how he handled fallout from the real estate debacle.San Diego’s political drama doesn’t appear to have gripped residents like earlier scandal, including the resignation in 2013 of Bob Filner, the first Democratic mayor in 20 years, after weeks of near-daily allegations of harassing women, including city employees.A Republican mayor, Dick Murphy, resigned in 2004 after a pension crisis made San Diego a poster child for financial mismanagement.In a lawsuit filed Tuesday in San Diego Superior Court, the government staffer says she began exchanging messages with Fletcher in 2021 when he started visiting her social media accounts. He once wrote, “Home alone — no wife and kids.” He urged her to delete his texts and be discreet.The staffer says Fletcher kissed her in the stairway of a hotel where he was staying in May 2022. Weeks later, he allegedly texted her during a meeting that he had for five minutes and asked her to go to an adjoining conference room, where he kissed and grabbed her.The worker was fired Feb. 6 after she “attempted to engage in meaningful, pre-litigation discussions with Fletcher to resolve her claims quietly and amicably,” her lawsuit says. On Sunday, just before Fletcher ended his Senate run, Fletcher’s attorney threatened to sue the worker for extortion, she said.Fletcher acknowledged “consensual interactions” with someone outside his marriage.“I haven’t done the things that are alleged but I did violate the basic trust of my marriage and set a terrible example for our children,” he said in a statement.San Diego County Democratic Party Chair Becca Taylor said Thursday that Fletcher’s decision to resign was appropriate, echoing other political leaders.Gonzalez Fletcher, executive secretary-treasurer of the California Labor Federation, said she loves her husband and believes “his name will be cleared"" but that she urged him to resign.___This story was first published on March 30, 2023.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852013,CCP paid Chinese gangsters US$200 each to crash Taiwan president's NY arrival: NSB,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwan's National Security Bureau alleged that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) paid pro-China group members and gangsters to protest President Tsai Ing-wen's (蔡英文) arrival in New York.On the first leg of her ""Democratic Partnership for Common Prosperity Journey,"" Tsai landed in New York on Wednesday (March 29) and her entourage arrived at Lotte New York Palace Hotel in midtown Manhattan and at 4 p.m. Hundreds of Chinese protesters tried to spoil Tsai's arrival but were forced by security personnel to stand behind barricades on the other side of the street from Taiwanese supporters, who managed to drown out the Chinese with their cheers for Tsai.During a session of the Legislative Yuan's Foreign and National Defense Committee on Thursday (March 30), Legislator Wang Ting-yu (王定宇) pointed out that there are media reports that the CCP mobilized the Chinese Consulate General in Los Angeles and New York, United Front members, gangsters, and overseas Chinese to protest Tsai's visit to the U.S. and asked whether the National Security Bureau (NSB) was aware of this. Tsai Ming-yen (蔡明彥), the new director general of the NSB, said that he is fully aware that China has indeed directed the consulates in Los Angeles and New York to mobilize pro-Chinese associations to protest against the president.When Wang asked how the NSB is planning to deal with the mobilization of gangsters, Tsai stated that the bureau is in close contact with U.S. counterparts on this matter. Prior to the president's visit, Tsai said that he established communication with the New York Police Department and Los Angeles Police Department.He also said that each member of the mobilized groups who protests against the president will receive US$200 per day, not including room and board and transportation. Tsai stated that because the cost is very high, they are targeting specific locations and times on the president's itinerary, such as her March 29 arrival at the hotel and banquet with overseas Taiwanese.When Wang asked how the U.S. is planning to deal with the ""gangsters paid by China to harass the elected head of state,"" Tsai said that U.S. counterparts will immediately share relevant information with the NSB about the president's activities which could be targeted for interference by the CCP. Tsai stated that U.S. authorities will also report, inspect, enforce, and control groups trying to interfere with the president's activities in accordance with the law.In response to a question about whether the NSB will work with the FBI or local police, Tsai said that in addition to local police, the bureau will also contact and coordinate with local State Department security offices.",2023/03/31,6172,Politics

The word ""fresh"" in the traditional Chinese context refers to the freshness of food, while the English word ""SHEEN"", is like the Chinese pronunciation, a visual concept, specifically referring to the luminous color.       Shanghai Tang x Artist Gao Ludi presents ""Fresh SHEEN""   Tang jackets and vests reinterpreted for an artful outfit.Gao Ludi ‘s take on Shanghai Tang glows under the sun in neon hues.     We invited Fine Artist Gao Ludi to reinterpret Shanghai Tang with a unisex limited capsule collection. Bringing the artist's bold use of colour from his paintings, Gao Ludi created a series of intricately hand-crafted vests and jackets inspired by industrial protective garments accentuated with reflective material within the innovative design features. Reflective ropes create hidden light waves within the garment, and an Oriental touch is expressed through the matching frog buttons and the contrasting colour edging. The design elements perfectly combine and express themes of construction, art, and craftsmanship, bringing a fresh new style to Shanghai Tang that yearns to Make Life A Party.   The ""Fresh SHEEN"" collection took inspiration from senses of taste and smell in the use of colour. Gao Ludi incorporates the ""freshness"" from nature, giving tableware a light color scheme, imitating abstract water and imagery of grass to provide a scenic and tranquil atmosphere.   For the home fragrance diffuser, Gao Ludi created a series of abstract mushroom umbrella tops, which were used as the main visual element on the bottles in different sizes. The confrontation of the two concepts creates a unique sensory association that resonates with the artist's creative lineage of colliding colors and forms.

Through collaborative collections with renowned artists such as Liu Ye, Jacky Tsai, Xu Bing, Chen Wei and Zhou Yi Lun, Shanghai Tang has witnessed the explosion of artistic power among different generations, and art has also witnessed key points in Shanghai Tang's brand development. When art and fashion meet, a more profound interpretation of the contemporary oriental aesthetic concept arises.  Hashtag: #ShanghaiTang

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852056,"Trump's indictment, long expected, still stuns at NYC court","NEW YORK (AP) — If you didn’t know what you were looking for, you might’ve missed it. Even then, it was hard to know at the moment that history was unfolding before your eyes.Donald Trump’s indictment, the first of a former U.S. president, was quietly brought to the clerk’s office at the Manhattan criminal courthouse just before closing time Thursday.A woman and two men in suits walked in past reporters who’ve been staking out the office for weeks, turned a corner and disappeared through a door to a non-public area known as the indictment room.The vibe in the room shifted, and then around the courthouse, too.The clerk’s office, normally a bustle of lawyers and paralegals seeking case files and submitting papers, people posting bail and court employees cracking jokes, grew quiet and tense.Moments later, just before 5 p.m., when a reporter asked if there were any filings involving “People v. Donald Trump” — her customary end-of-day question in recent days — a usually cheerful clerk sternly replied: “We have no information on that case. The office is closing. You have to leave.”The reporters, from outlets including The Associated Press, The New York Times, New York Post and legal publication Law360, left the office and stood outside in the hallway, watching through glass doors as workers turned out the lights and the people who’d walked in a few minutes earlier worked in darkness inside filing the indictment.“After visiting the clerk’s office for weeks, this was all very strange,” said Frank G. Runyeon, a reporter for Law360. “Very unusual and we knew something was up.”As the people continued to work, and reporters peered in at what was going on, court officers came to the hallway and shooed the press away. That floor of the courthouse was now closed, they said.The indictment remains under seal, its contents secret, likely until Trump is arraigned. But news of the indictment, voted on by a grand jury sitting in a court building across the street from the criminal courthouse, broke shortly after 5 p.m. in The New York Times. It was confirmed minutes later by Trump’s lawyers and ultimately in a brief statement from the Manhattan district attorney's office.The indictment was broadly expected for two weeks, with Trump himself even saying he expected to be arrested. Yet it still came as a surprise. Reports in recent days had indicated that the grand jury was about to go on a lengthy, scheduled break and wasn’t expected to be dealing with the Trump matter until late April.The announcement sent television crews pouring onto the sidewalks around the courthouse complex and brought a handful of demonstrators carrying banners and posters — some who opposed Trump and some that supported him.Police surrounded the courthouse into the evening, with flood lights illuminating the sidewalk and streets.Ditte Lynge, who works for a Danish newspaper that has been staking out the courthouse all week, was among the reporters who rushed to the scene.“Everyone’s following what’s going on over here,"" she said of her audience back home. “This is historical. It’s the first time that a former American president has been indicted. So of course, it has a lot of interest.""___Associated Press writer Bobby Caina Calvan contributed to this report.",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852057,"Climate, coups risk African goal of silencing guns by 2030","UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The goal of silencing the guns in Africa this decade is being challenged by climate change, terrorism, coups and the continent’s history, the head of the African Union initiative told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday.Attaining the goal is at risk even after the date was pushed back once to 2030, Mohamed Ibn Chambas said. He pointed to constitutional, institutional and cultural challenges as well as “Africa’s vulnerability to global economic shocks” — and weak implementation of international, national and regional decisions on peace, security and development.Silencing the guns was a key initiative in the vision for “an integrated, prosperous and peaceful Africa” adopted by AU leaders in May 2013. Called Agenda 2063, it originally stated that all guns would be silenced in 2023, but in December 2020 the AU decided to extend the date to 2030.That’s the same year the United Nations set to achieve its 17 major development goals that are also lagging, including ending poverty, ensuring secondary education for all children, achieving gender equality, and providing affordable and clean energy.Chambas told the Security Council that when AU leaders adopted the silencing the guns initiative “they were motivated by the desire to bequeath future generations of Africans a continent free of wars and conflicts.”The objective was to work toward “an Africa at peace with itself and with the rest of the world,” he said, but today multiple challenges have put that goal at risk, starting with the widening gap between rich and poorer nations, and between elites and marginalized people and communities within countries.For example, Chambas said, the COVID-19 pandemic “pushed 55 million Africans into poverty in 2020 and reversed more than two decades of progress in poverty reduction on the continent.” He said “equally alarming is the fact that 15 African countries are reportedly at risk of debt distress,” and today the continent’s debt is more than $600 billion.Chambas urged stepped up efforts to reduce inequalities and make new investments in education, technology and health while ensuring Africa’s young population could attain decent jobs. He also urged a crackdown on illegal financial flows that deprive the continent of approximately $90 billion annually.He said Africa should shift from exporting raw materials to exporting manufactured goods and processed agricutural products, which would require investment in cross-border infrastruture. Chambas said Africa should produce its own food, calling it “untenable,” that a continent with 60% of the world’s remaining arable lands and many rivers and freshwater bodies is dependent on grain imports.The AU high representative for implementing the silencing the guns initiative said achieving the goal also depends on addressing recent coups and unconstitutional changes in government and countering the scourge of terrorism, and the internal and external factors causing conflict and instability in Africa.Armed conflict looms large across the continent. Jihadi insurgencies plague Somalia, Nigeria, Mozambique, Burkina Faso which had two coups last year, and Mali whose leader seized power in a 2020 coup. The extremist violence threatened to spread to even more countries while militias continue fighting in mineral-rich eastern Congo.Mozambique’s President Filipe Nyusi, who chaired the council meeting, told members on Tuesday that the global terrorism threat “remains more critical” in Africa. He pointed to one global terrorism index that showed 40% of victims last year were African and called the Sahel region ""the new epicenter of terrorist attacks.”Chambas said he believes Mozambique’s successful peace process with former rebel movement Renamo “could be a model for lesson sharing on our continent” – a view echoed by Mirko Manzoni, the personal envoy of U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to Mozambique.Nyusi urged all African leaders on Thursday to resolve the causes that lead to feelings of injustice, social inequality and exclusion that fuel conflicts, and “to fast track the silencing of the guns once and for all.”",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852058,Red Bull chief criticizes new F1 pit wall celebration edict,"MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Red Bull principal Christian Horner has criticized the stricter interpretation of a rule that bans Formula One team employees from climbing pit wall for victory celebrations.Horner said on Friday at the Australian Grand Prix that F1 will lose out by stopping what he described as “iconic” celebrations after ruling body FIA issued a new safety memo before Sunday's Australian race, the third in this year's seriesF1 race director Niels Wittich issued instructions stating “it is forbidden to climb on a pit wall debris fence at any time.”Stating team personnel are only allowed in pit lane just before or after they are required to work on a car, the safety edict said employees must exit as soon as the work is complete.“Any action by a team breaching this ban will be reported to the stewards,” the statement reads.After Red Bull’s Max Verstappen recorded the fastest lap time in the opening practice session around the Albert Park circuit, Horner appeared bemused by the clampdown.“I’m surprised it was an issue, to be honest with you, but I think anything that relates to safety, obviously, has to be taken very, very seriously,” he said. “But it’s a fairly iconic moment when you see a Grand Prix car finishing a Grand Prix and its team celebrating on a fence, as long as it’s done in a manner that is safe. I, personally, have never seen an issue with it. It’s always been a part of Grand Prix racing.""McLaren chief executive Zak Brown said he was not sure what prompted the clampdown, with teams facing the prospect of being penalized for any breaches.“I’m not exactly sure what sparked the necessity to change it,” he said. “I’m not aware of an incident. That being said, safety is critically important to all of us and if they feel it’s potentially not safe, and those are the rules, then we’ll stick to it.”Horner, meanwhile, is happy for Verstappen and teammate Sergio Perez to duel on the track but said they must remember that the team comes first. The rivalry between the teammates has been the subject of significant discussion this season, with the pair splitting the opening two races of the year in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia.Verstappen leads the drivers’ championship by one point after gaining a bonus point for setting the fastest lap at Jeddah two weeks ago.Perez has made it clear he wants to challenge for the championship and Horner said it is fine for the teammates to continue pushing each other.“(Sergio’s) confidence is sky high. And that’s exactly what we want. We want two drivers that are going to be pushing and challenging each other,” he said. “They are competitive animals and they are both racing drivers at the end of the day. But they know the rules of engagement, that it is team first, particularly at this stage of the year.""Meanwhile, organizing body FIA says it has completed a review into the bizarre circumstances which saw Alonso demoted to fourth position in Jeddah for a breach on the starting grid, only to reverse the decision soon after on appeal.FIA clarified the wording of a rule related to “working on the car” and how it will be regulated and also widened the starting grid boxes for the Australian Grand Prix.Having dominated the opening two races, Red Bull was again the pacesetter in the two practice sessions Friday. Verstappen’s time of 1 minute, 18.790 seconds was the fastest of both sessions and 0.433 seconds quicker than seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton in the first practice outing.On a tricky day for drivers, with the Red Bull pair among the drivers to lose control in the first session, heavy rain hit Albert Park midway through the second practice.Fernando Alonso, who placed third for Aston Martin in the opening two races, set the best time in the second practice of 1:18.887. Ferrari’s Charles LeClerc, who won the 2022 Australian GP, was second quickest, with Verstappen .615 seconds slower with the third fastest time.___More AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852059,Blues win 5-3 to hand Blackhawks 7th straight defeat,"CHICAGO (AP) — Logan Brown and Alexey Toropchenko scored 38 seconds apart in the second period, and the St. Louis Blues beat the skidding Chicago Blackhawks 5-3 on Thursday night.Jakub Vrana, Jordan Kyrou and Brandon Saad also scored for St. Louis. Justin Faulk had two assists.The Blues, still clinging to faint playoff hopes, have won two straight and three of four.“We’re scoring goals, and we’ve got a lot of guys playing pretty good offense right now,” coach Craig Berube said. “That’s the bottom line. Our penalty kill hasn’t been great. Our power play hasn’t been great lately. We’re still finding ways to score goals and win games.”It was the seventh consecutive loss for the Blackhawks, who dropped into a tie with Columbus for last place in the overall NHL standings with 54 points each.Andreas Athanasiou, Tyler Johnson and Boris Katchouk scored for Chicago.Kyrou took Sammy Blais’ pass from left wing and beat Chicago goaltender Petr Mrazek from the slot for his 34th goal of the season, giving St. Louis a 4-2 lead with 10:35 left.Katchouk scored 36 seconds later on a deke that fooled Blues goalie Jordan Binnington.Binnington made the biggest of his 30 saves on Lucas Reichel with 1:45 to play. Saad added an empty-net goal with 1:13 remaining.“We just don’t have that natural finish right now,” Chicago coach Luke Richardson said. “Maybe that’s where our squad is right now.”Brown and Toropchenko gave the Blues a 3-1 lead in the second. Brown scored his second of the season at 12:59 by tipping Faulk’s 30-foot wrist shot by Mrazek after Blackhawks defenseman Anders Bjork failed to clear the puck.“Sometimes you get on runs where you get more chances,” said Faulk, who has nine points in his last four games.Toropchenko took a pass from Tyler Pitlick and fired it past Mrazek at 13:37.“In the second, we kind of fell apart a bit,” Chicago forward Taylor Raddysh said. “We fought to the end and fell short. Reichel had a great chance.”Vrana opened the scoring 4:25 into the second, parking in the slot to backhand Saad’s pass by Mrazek.Athanasiou tied it on a power play midway through the period, propelling the puck into an open net after Binnington bit on Johnson's fake.Chicago's second goal also came on a power play when Johnson tipped a hard pass from Raddysh by Binnington just 31 seconds into the third.Mrazek finished with 24 saves.RED HOT FOR BLUESVrana’s goal gave him nine since coming over to St. Louis from Detroit on March 3, the third-best output in the NHL during that time. Three of his goals have come on the power play. By comparison, Blues leading goal-scorer Kyrou has eight goals in that stretch.UP NEXTBlues: Play at Nashville on Saturday.Blackhawks: Will host New Jersey on Saturday.___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852060,Malaysia's top court refuses ex-PM Najib's bid for review,"PUTRAJAYA, Malaysia (AP) — Malaysia's top court refused Friday to review its 2022 decision to uphold former Prime Minister Najib Razak's conviction for graft and 12-year jail sentence, saying he was “the author of his own misfortune.”A five-member Federal Court bench unanimously rejected his final appeal in August in a case linked to the looting of state investment fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad, sending Najib straight to prison to start serving his sentence. But Najib has sought a review to overturn the decision, saying he has been denied a fair trial.A new Federal Court panel rejected Najib's assertion in a majority judgement. This effectively shut the lid on the case, which means that Najib will have to serve out the duration of his sentence. If he had won a review, he could have been freed on bail pending a new appeal hearing.Najib was stone-faced when the judgement was read out.Four of five judges said they found “no failure of justice.” They dismissed the defense's arguments that there was a conflict of interest by the judge who convicted him, Najib was not given sufficient time for his new lawyer to prepare for the case, and he wasn't allowed to cite new evidence. The judges said the earlier Federal Court panel had applied the laws correctly.“In this matter, with respect, we are constrained to say the applicant is the author of his own misfortune,” said Justice Vernon Ong.Justice Abdul Rahman Sebli dissented, saying that there must be confidence in the administration of justice. He spent more than an hour explaining why he saw a miscarriage of justice in the handling of the final appeal last year.Later, lead prosecutor V. Sithambaram told reporters that Friday's decision was “a vindication that the charges are legally mounted and not politically motivated.”""This prosecution has shown that no man in this land is above the law,” he said, adding that it should send a “chilling message” that the law would catch up with all offenders.But defense counsel Muhammad Shafee Abdullah said it was “not the end of the matter yet.""While the defense team was extremely disappointed, Shafee said, the strong dissenting judgement has opened up the possibility of a fresh review. He noted that Abdul Rahman even suggested an acquittal instead of a retrial on grounds that Najib wasn't accorded a fair trial. Shafee declined to give further details on Najib's next move.While further review of the case is possible, Sithambaram said it was unlikely.The British-educated Najib was born into Malaysia’s political elite. His father was the country’s second prime minister and his uncle was the third.He became prime minister in 2009 as a reformer but his term was tainted by the 1MDB scandal that sparked investigations in the United States and several other countries and caused his government’s downfall in 2018 general elections.Investigators allege at least $4.5 billion was stolen from the 1MDB fund, set up shortly after Najib took power, and laundered by Najib’s associates. Najib was found guilty in 2020 of seven charges of corruption for illegally receiving $9.4 million from SRC International, a former unit of 1MDB.Najib was the country’s first former leader to be imprisoned. He still faces dozens of charges in several separate trials linked to 1MDB. His wife, Rosmah Mansor, was also sentenced to 10 years in jail for a separate corruption case and is out on bail pending appeal.___Find more of AP’s Asia-Pacific coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852061,36 bodies found inside well after collapse at Indian temple,"NEW DELHI (AP) — Thirty-six bodies have been found inside a well at a Hindu temple in central India after dozens of people attending a festival fell into the muddy water when its cover collapsed, officials said Friday.Video of Thursday’s collapse at the temple complex in Indore in Madhya Pradesh state showed chaos afterward, with people rushing away. An excavator pulled down a wall of the decades-old temple to help people flee.Nearly 140 rescuers, including army personnel, used ropes and ladders to pull the bodies from the well after pumping out the water. A narrow path and debris in the well made the task difficult.“We have recovered 36 bodies and everybody is accounted for now,” Pawan Kumar Sharma, commissioner of the local municipal corporation, told The Associated Press.The secretary of the temple board was among the dead and the president is recovering from injuries, Sharma said.Police brought a case of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, but no arrests have been made so far, he said.Witnesses said a large crowd of devotees had thronged the temple to perform a fire ritual and celebrate the festival for the deity Rama.Dozens of people fell into the water when the structure collapsed and were covered by falling debris, police Commissioner Makrand Deoskar said.Kantibhai Patel, president of a residents' association, told reporters that authorities were slow to react and the first ambulance reached the spot an hour after the alert.The structure apparently caved in because it could not handle the weight of the large crowd, said the state's top elected official, Shivraj Singh Chauhan. He ordered an investigation.A team of army rescuers joined the operation on Thursday night. The Times of India newspaper reported the rescue work was expedited after underwater cameras showed bodies floating in the muddy waters of the well.Chauhan said 33 of the bodies had been identified. Sixteen of the people who were injured remained hospitalized Friday.Sobbing relatives claimed the bodies of the victims and visited the hospital where the injured were being treated.Temple authorities had stopped using the well years ago and covered the mouth with iron grills and tiles.Municipal authorities in January ordered the temple owners to remove the covering of the well because it was an unsafe and unauthorized structure, but temple authorities ignored the warning, the newspaper said.Building collapses are common in India because of poor construction and a failure to observe regulations.In October, a century-old cable suspension bridge collapsed into a river in the western state of Gujarat, sending hundreds of people plunging into the water and killing at least 132 in one of the worst accidents in the country in the past decade.___Find more of AP’s Asia-Pacific coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific",2023/03/31,,World

McDavid also became the fifth player in league history to reach 300 goals and 500 assists before playing 600 career games, following Gretzky, Mario Lemieux, Peter Statsny and Bryan Trottier.Stuart Skinner made 43 saves for his first shutout of the season and second in the NHL, helping the Oilers move past the Kings into third place in the Western Conference. Edmonton is 12-2-1 in March.“I felt pretty good,” Skinner said. “I think confidence grows as the team is doing such a good job in front of me. I think for a full 60 minutes that we just battled hard. Being able to get the two points is massive. We were so hungry to win every battle and I think that was very impressive to watch.”The only other time Skinner had an NHL shutout was last season against San Jose, but he was sent down to the AHL the following day.“We’re not going to do the same thing we did last year,” Oilers coach Jay Woodcroft said. “He’s mature beyond his years. He came up with the big save at the right time. That team shoots from everywhere, they’re volume shooters. But had some really good chances late in the third and Stuart was there.”Evander Kane opened the scoring with 52 seconds left in the first period with his 15th of the season.Korpisalo made 35 saves for Los Angeles. The Kings have lost two in a row after a franchise-record 12-game points streak.“I thought it was a hell of a game, both teams played really hard and it came down to a bounce or a break or two and they were able to score,” Kings coach Todd McLellan said. “We had some real good looks and we ran into a hot goaltender and didn’t quite get it over the goal line, but I thought it was a heck of game.”UP NEXTKings: At Seattle on Saturday night.Oilers: Host Anaheim on Saturday night.___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/31,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852064,Trump indictment throws 2024 race into uncharted territory,"NEW YORK (AP) — The historic indictment of former President Donald Trump thrust the 2024 presidential election into uncharted territory, raising the remarkable prospect that the leading contender for the Republican nomination will seek the White House while also facing trial for criminal charges in New York.In an acknowledgment of the sway the former president holds with the voters who will decide the GOP contest next year, those eyeing a primary challenge to Trump were quick to criticize the indictment. Without naming Trump, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis called the move “un-American.” Former Vice President Mike Pence, whose life was threatened after Trump incited an insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, told CNN the charges were “outrageous.”That posture speaks to the short-term incentives for Republicans to avoid anything that might antagonize Trump's loyal base. But the indictment raises profound questions for the GOP's future, particularly as Trump faces the possibility of additional charges soon in Atlanta and Washington. While that might galvanize his supporters, the turmoil could threaten the GOP's standing in the very swing-state suburbs that have abandoned the party in three successive elections, eroding its grip on the White House, Congress and key governorships.Trump has spent four decades managing to skirt this type of legal jeopardy and expressed confidence again late Thursday, blaming the charges on “Thugs and Radical Left Monsters.”“THIS IS AN ATTACK ON OUR COUNTRY THE LIKES OF WHICH HAS NEVER BEEN SEEN BEFORE,” Trump wrote on his social media site.Trump is “ready to fight,” his attorney, Joe Tacopina, said on Fox News,Trump is expected to surrender to authorities next week on charges connected to hush money payments made during the 2016 presidential campaign to women who alleged extramarital sexual encounters. For now, it remains unclear how the development will resonate with voters. Polls show Trump remains the undisputed frontrunner for the Republican nomination, and his standing has not faltered, even amid widespread reporting on the expected charges.Trump's campaign and his allies have long hoped an indictment would serve as a rallying cry for his supporters, angering his “Make America Great Again” base, drawing small dollar donations and forcing Trump's potential rivals into the awkward position of having to defend him — or risk their wrath.Indeed, Trump’s campaign began fundraising off the news almost immediately after it broke, firing an email to supporters with the all-caps subject line “BREAKING: PRESIDENT TRUMP INDICTED.”At Trump's first rally of the 2024 campaign, held in Texas over the weekend, supporters expressed widespread disgust with the investigation and insisted the case wouldn't affect his chances.“It’s a joke,” said Patti Murphy, 63, of Fort Worth. “It’s just another way of them trying to get him out of their way.”Others in the crowd said their support for Trump had been waning since he left the White House, but the looming indictment made them more likely to support him in 2024 because they felt his anger had been justified.At the same time, there is little chance a criminal trial will help Trump in a general election, particularly with independents, who have grown tired of his constant chaos. That has provided an opening for alternatives like DeSantis, who are expected to paint themselves as champions of the former president’s policies, but without all his baggage.But there were no immediate signs the party was ready to use the indictment to move past him. Instead, Republicans, including members of Congress and Trump's rivals, rushed to his defense en masse. In addition to DeSantis, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who has already declared her candidacy, blasted the indictment as “more about revenge than it is about justice.” Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who is mulling a run, accused Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg of “undermining America’s confidence in our legal system,” while also sending a fundraising text off the news.Trump, meanwhile, has tried to turn the public against the case. Early on March 18, amid reports that police in New York were preparing for a possible indictment, he fired off a message on his social media site in which he declared that he expected to be arrested within days.While that never came to pass (and his aides made clear it had not been based on any inside information), Trump used the time to highlight the case's widely-discussed weaknesses and to attack Bragg with a barrage of deeply personal — and at times racist — attacks.Trump also sought to project an air of strength. The night of his post, he traveled with aides to a college wrestling championship, where he spent hours greeting supporters and posing for photos. On the way home, the assembled entourage watched mixed martial arts cage fighting aboard his plane.And last weekend, Trump held a rally in Waco, Texas, where he railed against the case in front of thousands of supporters.People who have spoken with Trump in recent weeks have described him as both angry and unbothered about the prospect of charges. Freshman Republican Rep. Mark Alford of Missouri said Trump was “upbeat” at a fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago the night before he warned of his arrest.Indeed, Trump has at times appeared in denial about the gravity of the situation. He and his aides were caught off-guard by the news Thursday. And during the plane ride home from his Texas rally, Trump told reporters he believed the case had been dropped.“I have no idea what’s going to happen, but I can tell you that they have no case. So I think the case is — I think they’ve already dropped the case, from what I understand. I think it’s been dropped,” he said.Still, Trump responded with anger when pressed, even as he insisted he was not frustrated.Beyond the Manhattan case, Trump is facing several other investigations, including a Georgia inquiry into his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election and a federal probe into his alleged mishandling of classified documents.It remains unclear how the public might respond if Trump ends up facing charges in additional cases, particularly if some lead to convictions and others are dismissed.An indictment —- or even a conviction — would not bar Trump from running for president or serving as the Republican nominee.___ Associated Press writers Paul Weber in Waco, Texas, and Lisa Mascaro in Orlando contributed to this report.",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852065,"Renfroe makes no-look catch in right, delighting Ohtani","OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) — The ball was headed toward deep right field, so Los Angeles Angels outfielder Hunter Renfroe took a step that way.But then the wind shifted and carried Jace Peterson's drive toward right-center instead, leaving Renfroe scrambling.He stuck out his glove and — somehow — corralled it. A no-look grab, if there is such a thing.“There's no normal catch about it. You catch it behind your head and backwards. That's not great, but you've gotta do what you've gotta do sometimes,” he said. “It was a lot of different directions. It looks like I’m out there in a circus, but caught it.”Renfroe actually regularly works on making trick catches during batting practice.“Now I'm going to use it,” he joked.His amazing, no-look grab was one for the highlight reels on opening day.Playing his first game with the Angels, Renfroe could only grin ear to ear after robbing Peterson with a defensive gem to start the bottom of the fifth inning in Los Angeles' 2-1 loss to the Oakland Athletics on Thursday night.“I'm glad I caught it. Not the way you want to draw it up,” Renfroe said.Running backward toward the wall, he got twisted around and blindly reached his glove up to make the catch just in front of the warning track — without even tracking the ball with his eyes at the end.Angels pitcher Shohei Ohtani raised his arms in delight from the mound and put his hands on his head for a second as other teammates smiled.“I'm sure he was kind of grateful I caught it and relieved as well,” Renfroe said.After rounding second base, Peterson looked back over his shoulder out at Renfroe in right — almost in disbelief.“I thought it was going to be a hit 100%,” a chuckling Ohtani said through interpreter Ippei Mizuhara. “He threw his glove out there and it found the glove.”“WHAT WAS THAT” the Angels posted on Twitter with a shocked emoji face.Rookie catcher Logan O'Hoppe said: “Hearing how he went about it in his head when he came in the dugout was even more impressive. He said he had it all the way.”“He's lying,” Renfroe said.But he acknowledged some expletives came out of his mouth.“I've never seen anything like that,” Angels center fielder Mike Trout said. “From my angle, I don't know what was going on. I saw the replay from the dugout ... have you guys seen anything like it? Me, either.”___More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/31,,World

Speaking to reporters, Kritenbrink said that ""There is absolutely no reason for China to overreact to this longstanding, routine practice."" ""Unilateral attempts to change the status quo will not pressure the United States government to alter our longstanding practice to facilitate transits through the United States,"" he added.
The assistant secretary reaffirmed Washington’s “one China” but noted that Tsai has transited through the United States six times before ""without incident.""
Tsai is currently embarking on a trip to Taiwan’s Central American allies, Belize and Guatemala, but had a brief layover in New York City. On her return journey, she will also stop in Los Angeles where she is expected to meet with U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy.
China's Taiwan Affairs Office spokesperson Zhu Fenglian (朱鳳蓮) warned that China would ""definitely take measures to resolutely fight back"" if Tsai met with McCarthy, per Reuters. China's charge d'affaires in the U.S, Xu Xueyuan (徐學淵), said such a meeting ""could lead to another serious confrontation in the China-U.S. relationship.""

The group comprises 63 people from 16 families, including 35 children.The group has remained in Thailand for nearly a year, despite the Chinese state security apparatus threatening their safety on a daily basis, according to ChinaAid. The U.S.-based human rights organization, which promotes religious freedom, provides legal assistance to the Guangzhou-based church.ChinaAid Founder and President, Bob Fu (傅希秋) said in an interview with RFA that the United Nations and the U.S. government should help relocate church members to a safer place. This incident graphically illustrates the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) global overreach and ceaseless persecution of religious faith, he said.""That would be a human rights disaster and a massive shame if these families were repatriated to China,"" Fu added.Sam Brownback, former U.S ambassador at-large for international religious freedom, also tweeted his concern on Thursday after learning the news, urging the Thai government to release the families immediately. ""The Thai government will be issuing a virtual death sentence if members of the Mayflower Church are deported to China.""Taiwan's Legislative Speaker You Si-kun on Friday expressed his concern on Facebook, calling for the plight of church members to receive international attention and for rescue actions to be carried out ""before it is too late.""""It is undoubtedly a deliberate provocation as China opted to carry out transnational repression when the U.S. President Joe Biden's second Summit for Democracy is taking place,"" You's post read.In the same post, You called out ex-President Ma Ying-jeou (馬英九), who is on a controversial visit to China.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852102,Shadowy brokers walk off with billions in Venezuelan oil,"CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — One startup lists as its address a small home in a working-class district in Venezuela's capital whose owner has never heard of the firm. Another is a Hong Kong-based shell company created in 2020. Yet another belongs to a Spanish commodities trader indicted in the U.S. for allegedly helping Russian oligarchs launder ill-gotten profits.They are among the dozens of obscure middlemen at the center of a new crackdown in Venezuela on corruption in the state-run oil industry that has government insiders scurrying for cover — and regular Venezuelans are asking how more than $20 billion in proceeds from oil shipments seemingly vanished.The purge began this month when authorities arrested 21 business people and senior officials as part of an investigation into missing payments for oil. To promote the anti-corruption crusade, state media this week was filled with images of the defendants dressed in orange jumpsuits walking into their initial judicial hearing.Corruption has long plagued Venezuela — the OPEC nation was the fourth-most corrupt in the world in the latest rankings by Transparency International — but those in positions of power are rarely held accountable.And when high profile arrests do take place, Venezuelans tend to view them as the result of a behind-the-scenes tug of war among heavyweights in the ruling socialist party, and not any impartial meting out of justice in a country where most institutions lack independence.An entrenched culture of corruption and the inherently opaque nature of trading illegal crude oil take malfeasance to another level.“It would be very difficult for even a much less corrupt state to implement all the necessary controls,"" said Francisco Monaldi, a Venezuelan who heads the Latin America energy program at Rice University’s Baker Institute for Public Policy.While the fallout from the scandal continues, it already has felled one major power broker: Tareck El Aissami, the country's oil czar. He quit in the wake of the arrests, which included the detention of a close associate, Joselit Ramirez, who had been serving as Venezuela's cryptocurrency regulator.While Venezuelan authorities have not mentioned El Aissami as a target in the investigation, most of the shady transactions at state-run oil giant Petroleos de Venezuela SA occurred under his watch.Internal PDVSA documents obtained by The Associated Press show the state oil company was owed $10.1 billion as of August 2022 from 90 mostly unknown trading companies that have emerged as major buyers of Venezuelan crude since the U.S. imposed economic sanctions in a campaign to oust President Nicolás Maduro.An additional $13.3 billion, corresponding to 241 shipments, is owed directly to the national government as a result of an October accounting maneuver by PDVSA that reassigned responsibility for collecting the unpaid invoices directly to the Maduro administration in lieu of cash royalties. That is more than the country's entire foreign currency reserves.All the oil cargoes were sold on consignment at a deep discount owing to the sanctions, which have scared away more established traders.PDVSA's reliance on intermediaries surged in 2020, when the Trump administration expanded sanctions with the threat to lock out of the U.S. economy any individual or company, regardless of nationality or location, that did business with Maduro's government.The punishing action, combined with a pandemic-induced global slump in demand for oil, led production that summer to plummet to 350,000 barrels a day — 10% of what it produced when Chávez took office in 1999.To sell what little is being produced, Maduro, with the help of allies Russia and Iran — themselves under U.S. sanctions — has had to rely on a complex network of intermediaries. Most are shell companies, registered in jurisdictions known for secrecy. The buyers deploy so-called ghost tankers that hide their location and hand off their valuable cargoes in the middle of the ocean before they reach their final destination..To avoid Western banks, Venezuela started accepting payments in Russian rubles, bartered goods or cryptocurrency.But not everyone paid.Among those on the delinquent list is Walker International, which owes PDVSA about $77 million, according to the documents. The company is registered in the United Arab Emirates but lists as its Venezuela address a modest house at the foot of the mountain range that separate Caracas from the Caribbean Sea.The owner of the home, Andres Muzo, expressed shock that his home could somehow be caught up in a case of international corruption.“I’m finding about this right now,” Muzo said after seeing his address in Dubai corporate records, which were first unearthed by Venezuelan news website Armando.info. He shook his head and said he would inquire with the people who rent his adjacent garage for an oil-change business.“We don’t know anything,” Muzo said.The broker with the largest debt is M and Y Trading Co, which was registered in Hong Kong in 2020. It owes PDVSA more than $1.2 billion, according to the internal documents, which someone knowledgeable about the transactions shared with AP on the condition that they remain anonymous.Another preferred vendor was United Petroleo Corp, which was registered in Panama in 2021 and owes more than $468 million. One of United's cargoes — a 600,000-barrel shipment last September — is at the center of a controversy on the Dutch Caribbean island of Curacao, where the Venezuelan crude is being stored at a facility tied to U.S. investors in possible defiance of sanctions.Yet another of PDVSA's go-to partners was Treseus International. The commodities brokerage, which did not respond to an email seeking comment, is run by Juan Fernando Serrano, a Spaniard indicted last year on money laundering charges in Manhattan federal court for conspiring to smuggle oil on behalf of wealthy Russians. That court also wants El Aissami and Ramirez on charges of violating U.S. sanctions stemming from El Aissami's 2017 designation by Washington as a “drug kingpin” for allegedly helping cartels smuggle cocaine through Venezuela.Authorities have yet to say how much money may be missing. But Maduro has used some of his recent public appearances to warn officials against graft. Supporters even gathered for an anti-corruption protest in Caracas.Past crackdowns — like the arrest of a former PDVSA president in 2017 — did little to clean up the oil industry, which is responsible for almost all of the country's hard currency earnings. Many analysts suspect Maduro is looking to stabilize the economy before next year's presidential election.“Coffers are bare and the country is entering an election year in which Maduro wants to convey a message that Venezuela is back on track,” said Geoff Ramsey, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. “The more it becomes clear that the economy remains in dire straits, the more Maduro will look for people to take the fall.”___Goodman reported from Miami.",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852103,Taiwan leader scrambles for allies in Central America visit,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — As Taiwan’s diplomatic partners dwindle and turn instead to rival China, Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen is aiming to shore up ties with the self-governing island’s remaining allies during a trip this week to Central America.Tsai touched down in Guatemala on Friday afternoon, walking from the plane along a red carpet alongside Guatemala's foreign minister.In a speech addressed to leaders of Guatemala and Belize shortly before departing on her visit, Tsai framed the trip as a chance to show Taiwan’s commitment to democratic values globally.“External pressure will not obstruct our resolution to go on the world stage. We will be calm, self-confident, we will not submit but also not provoke,” said Tsai, who will also meet with U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy in a stopover in the United States.But the trip also is aimed to solidifying ties in Latin America as China funnels money into the region and pressures its countries to break off relations with the self-governed democratic island.In Guatemala and Belize, Tsai is expected to bring an open checkbook. But in a region under growing Chinese influence, analysts say that Taiwan may already have lost the long game.“These countries, they are symbolic. And I don’t think Taiwan wants to lose any of them,” said June Teufel Dreyer, a political scientist at University of Miami. “But if China is going to indulge in checkbook diplomacy, I don’t think Taiwan can compete and it knows it.”The visit comes just days after Honduras became the latest country to break with Taiwan in favor of establishing ties with China.Honduras follows in the footsteps of Nicaragua, El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, Panama and Costa Rica in ditching Taiwan. In some cases, China was said to have dangled hefty investment packages and loans in exchange for switching allegiances.As the Asian superpower has sought to isolate Taiwan and expand its power on the global stage, Chinese trade and investment in Latin America has soared.Between 2005 and 2020, the Chinese have invested more than $130 billion in Latin America, according to the United States Institute of Peace. Trade between China and the region has also shot up, and is expected to reach more than $700 billion by 2035.Honduras’ move came in conjunction with the construction of a hydroelectric dam project built by the Chinese company SINOHYDRO with about $300 million in Chinese government financing.It left Taiwan with no more than 13 official diplomatic partners. More than half of those are small countries in Latin America and the Caribbean: Belize, Guatemala, Paraguay, Haiti, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.At the same time Chinese influence has grown, lagging spending by the U.S. — Taiwan’s primary ally and source of defensive weaponry — has caused its sway in Latin America to slip.For decades, China has claimed Taiwan as its own territory to be brought under its control by force if necessary, but the Taiwanese public overwhelmingly favors the current state of de-facto independence.China has spent a great amount of effort in its campaign to diplomatically isolate Taiwan ever since Tsai’s election in 2016, successfully convincing nine countries to break off relations with Taipei since she has been in office.China’s government views Tsai and her independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party as separatists.In recent months, tensions have only intensified as relations between Beijing and Washington have spiraled. As a result, regions like Central America have grown in geopolitical importance.“While our policy has not changed, what has changed is Beijing’s growing coercion – like trying to cut off Taiwan’s relations with countries around the world,” U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a speech about China relations last year.Guatemala and Belize are among those who have remained steadfast supporters of Taiwan, Guatemala’s government reaffirming in March its “recognition of Taiwan as an independent nation with which democratic values ​​and mutual respect are shared.”Yet analysts say their allegiance is also a political calculation.Tiziano Breda, researcher at International Affairs Institute, said that position will likely be wielded politically, used as a potential shield against pressure from the U.S.The U.S. government, for example, has been highly critical of the administration of President Alejandro Giammattei for not doing enough to crack down on corruption.“It’s a card these countries wait to play,” Breda said.Dreyer of University of Miami said many of Taiwan's allies will use their relationship with both China and Taiwan as a “bargaining chip” to seek greater investment and monetary benefits from both countries.She said in Ing-wen’s meetings with Guatemala and Belize, the president is likely to offer investment and development projects contingent on maintaining good relations with her country.But Dreyer noted that given the power China wields on a world stage, it’s only a matter of time before the economic superpower pulls Taiwan’s final diplomatic partners onto their side.The Chinese ""are not only willing to wait, but eager to wait until they think the time is ripe,” Dreyer said. “They want the most auspicious moment possible.”___Associated Press writer Huizhong Wu in Taipei contributed to this report.",2023/04/01,,World

Conference USA is now 18-2 in the NCAA postseason — with Charlotte winning the College Basketball Invitational title and FAU advancing to the Final Four.Perry, the conference player of the year and NIT MVP, made a steal and a 3-pointer on a fast break to give North Texas the lead for good at 55-53 with 6:22 remaining. Aaron Scott extended it to 61-55 after making a high-arching layup and a jumper.UAB guard Jordan Walker was fouled on a 3-pointer with 1:48 remaining and he made two free throws to get within 63-59. North Texas had two shots on its next possession after an offensive rebound and Perry sank a jumper.After UAB made two more free throws with 49.6 seconds left, Perry dribbled down the clock and hit a step-back jumper, with a foot on the 3-point line, for a 68-61 lead. UAB missed a 3-pointer and Huntsberry was fouled at 13.2 before securing it at the line.North Texas won its second NCAA postseason championship under sixth-year head coach Grant McCasland. The Mean Green won the 2018 CBI title in his first season in Denton.Scott finished with 13 points and seven rebounds for North Texas (31-7), which set a program record for wins in a season.Walker scored 21 points on 6-of-14 shooting for UAB (29-10), which was in the NIT title game for the first time in program history. KJ Buffen added 11 points.Javian Davis converted a three-point play with 12:43 left in the second half for UAB's first lead, 47-45, since it was 15-14. The Mean Green scored 22 of the first 30 second-half points.It was the fourth meeting of the season between the teams — with North Texas winning two regular-season meetings before a matchup in the conference tournament semifinals.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852106,US: Russia seeks arms-for-food deal with North Korea,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The White House on Thursday said it has new evidence that Russia is looking again to North Korea for weapons to fuel the war in Ukraine, this time in a deal that would provide Pyongyang with needed food and other commodities in return.It's the latest accusation that Russia, desperate for weaponry and restricted by sanctions and export controls, is turning to “rogue” nations to help it continue to prosecute the 13-month-old war.“As part of this proposed deal, Russia would receive over two dozen kinds of weapons and munitions from Pyongyang,” White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said. “We also understand that Russia is seeking to send a delegation to North Korea and that Russia is offering North Korea food in exchange for munitions.”The administration has previously declassified intelligence to present evidence that Iran sold hundreds of attack drones to Russia over the summer and that the Wagner Group, a private Russian military company, has taken delivery of arms from North Korea to help bolster its forces as they fight side-by-side with Russian troops in Ukraine.Experts believe the food situation in North Korea is the worst it has been under Kim Jong Un’s 11-year rule, but they still say they see no signs of imminent famine or mass deaths. Kim vowed to strengthen state control over agriculture and take a spate of other steps to increase grain production, North Korean state media reported earlier this month.Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last month that U.S. intelligence suggested China was considering providing arms and ammunition to Russia, though White House officials have said they have yet to see evidence of Beijing following through with weapons delivery.The publicizing of Russia's efforts to get weapons from North Korea is just the latest example of the Biden administration loosening restrictions on intelligence findings and making them public over the course of the grinding war in Ukraine.The administration has said it has sought to disseminate the intelligence findings so allies and the public remain clear-eyed about Moscow’s intent and Russian President Vladimir Putin thinks twice about his actions.Earlier Thursday, the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control announced sanctions against a Slovakian national, Ashot Mkrtychev, alleging he attempted to facilitate arms deals between Russia and North Korea.Kirby said Mkrtychev is at the center of the new North Korea-Russia deal, which has yet to be consummated. He added that the U.S. does not have evidence that Mkrtychev was involved in the earlier transfer of weapons to Russia's Wagner Group, whose mercenaries have been in the center of a monthslong battle for the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut.Between the end of 2022 and early 2023, Treasury said Mkrtychev worked with North Korean officials to obtain over two dozen kinds of weapons and munitions for Russia in exchange for commercial aircraft, raw materials and commodities to be sent to North Korea.Mkrtychev worked with a Russian citizen to find commercial aircraft to delivers goods to North Korea in the exchange.“Russia has lost over 9,000 pieces of heavy military equipment since the start of the war, and thanks in part to multilateral sanctions and export controls, Putin has become increasingly desperate to replace them,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement. “Schemes like the arms deal pursued by this individual show that Putin is turning to suppliers of last resort like Iran and the DPRK.”North Korea, an outlier on the global stage, has sought to enhance relations with Russia since its invasion of Ukraine brought an avalanche of sanctions from the West and broad international condemnation.Any arms deal with Russia would be a violation of U.N. resolutions that ban North Korea from exporting to or importing weapons from other countries.North Korea is the only nation aside from Russia and Syria to recognize the independence of Russia-backed separatist territories, Donetsk and Luhansk, in eastern Ukraine.",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852107,Pitch clock sparks Mariners rally for 3-0 win over Guardians,"SEATTLE (AP) — J.P. Crawford was the beneficiary of a pitch-clock violation. One big swing from Ty France made certain it became noteworthy on opening day.Crawford's walk helped by a timer infraction called on James Karinchak sparked an eighth-inning rally that was capped by France's three-run homer, and the Seattle Mariners beat the Cleveland Guardians 3-0 on Thursday night.“Obviously, there’s a lot of buzz around town about the expectations and what we hope to do this season and you can't get off on a much better start than we did tonight,” Seattle manager Scott Servais said.Opening day was a dramatic pitchers' duel between Cleveland ace Shane Bieber and Seattle’s Luis Castillo that lacked any offense until the wild eighth inning.Crawford walked on a 3-2 pitch but only after being gifted a ball when Karinchak (0-1) committed the lone pitch-clock violation of the game with the count 0-2. The reliever was clearly rattled, firing the pitch after the violation to the backstop. Crawford fouled off a couple of pitches and eventually walked on a check-swing that Cleveland argued should have been a foul ball.Guardians manager Terry Francona believed the ball had been foul tipped.“It happens and you're hoping that doesn't spur on more, but James had a tough inning ... and that made for a tougher inning,” Francona said.Kolten Wong was hit by a pitch with one out and France went opposite field with a pitch out of the strike zone and cleared the wall down the right-field line.France doubled off the wall in right-center earlier in the game and finished a triple short of the cycle. His homer ended any flashbacks the Mariners were experiencing from the last time they were in T-Mobile Park last October and lost 1-0 to Houston in 18 innings in the ALDS.""We hadn’t scored a run in 26 innings so it was time,” France said.Andrés Muñoz ran into trouble in the ninth, giving up a single to Amed Rosario and a double to José Ramírez with two outs. But the Seattle reliever got Guardians newcomer Josh Bell to ground out for the save, finishing a game that wrapped up in a brisk 2 hours, 14 minutes.Until the eighth, pitching was the story for both teams looking to replicate their playoff runs from last season.Castillo was dominant from the outset with another overpowering performance that fell in line with several spectacular starts last season after he was acquired from Cincinnati.Castillo needed just 74 pitches to get through six innings and that ended up being his limit. He struck out six and the only runner he allowed came on an infield single that clipped the right-hander.It was a scary moment at first as Will Brennan’s line drive struck the back of Castillo’s head, with most of the impact appearing to be absorbed by the pitcher's dreadlocks. Castillo said it was about 50/50 between impact on his head and his hair.“When the ball hit me, I realized that was OK right away,” Castillo said through an interpreter.Three relievers finished the four-hitter. Paul Sewald (1-0) worked a hitless eighth.Despite constant traffic on the bases, Bieber kept Seattle off the scoreboard and matched Castillo with six shutout innings. Bieber scattered six hits and struck out three, and most importantly came up with key pitches with two outs and runners in scoring position.“I couldn't really buy a clean inning today but that's what it's all about, trying to bend not break, and was able to do that for a couple of innings,” Bieber said.Seattle threatened in the third, fifth and sixth against Bieber but was unable to get a two-out hit with a runner at third. France grounded out in the third and Julio Rodríguez hit a line drive that was run down by Brennan in right-center to end the fifth.France doubled in the sixth — missing a home run by about a foot — but ended up stuck at third after Cal Raleigh popped out.TRAINER’S ROOMMariners: INF Dylan Moore (oblique) remains in Arizona at the club’s spring training facility.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852108,"Schwartz, Beniers lead Kraken to 4-1 win over Ducks","SEATTLE (AP) — Jaden Schwartz and Matty Beniers scored within three minutes of each other in the first period and the Seattle Kraken hung on to beat the Anaheim Ducks 4-1 on Thursday night.Daniel Sprong added a power-play goal with 4:18 left in the game and Alex Wennberg sealed it with an empty-netter. Martin Jones made 18 saves to help the Kraken keep their grip on the top Western Conference wild-card playoff spot.“We played a good hockey game,” Seattle coach Dave Hakstol said. “Could we have some things a little bit differently in the second period? Absolutely. We would have liked to be able to extend that lead. But we settled down in the third. We needed a couple real good saves from Martin Jones to do that, but the penalty kill did its job, the power play did its job in extending the lead and that’s it.“It closes out a good two points for us and it’s a real positive night.”Brock McGinn scored the lone goal for Anaheim. Lukas Dostal made 35 saves.Schwartz put the Kraken ahead at 7:57 of the first period. Will Borgen, playing on the right side behind his own blue line, angled a cross-ice pass that Schwartz caught up with just over Anaheim's blue line. From the top of the left circle, Schwartz fired it past Dostal.Beniers made it 2-0 at 10:37 when his shot went off the net, but came but came right back to him and he poked it in off the edge of his stick.Beniers had gone 13 straight games without a goal from Feb. 28 until getting his 20th in last Saturday’s 7-2 win at Nashville and now his 21st, tying him with Dallas’ Wyatt Johnson for most among rookies this season.“I think I was playing good before and after (the 20th),” Beniers said. “Sometimes, it just doesn’t go in, and that’s how the game works. You get one and it just starts falling.“Everyone goes through it. I think I was playing a good game before and I think I’m playing the same exact game now – they’re just going in.”McGinn cut Anaheim’s deficit to 2-1 with 1:16 left in the second period. In a scramble behind the net, Derek Grant came up with the puck and got it out to McGinn in the middle of the left circle. McGinn’s shot went off Jones’ right pad and into the far side.Sprong got his 20th of the season to make it 3-1 when he skated around a defender and lifted a shot high over Dostal’s left glove. Wennberg’s 13th came on a shot from behind the red line into the empty net with 2:15 to go.NOTES: McCann’s assist on Beniers’ first-period goal gave him 29 points (13 goals, 16 assists) in the last 28 games dating to Jan. 25. ...

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852109,Trump's indictment in New York: Here's what to know,"NEW YORK (AP) — Donald Trump has become the first former U.S. president to be charged with a crime, the culmination of a political rise defined by unprecedented scandal.The vote of a Manhattan grand jury to indict the Republican former president on charges related to hush money payments made on his behalf during his 2016 presidential campaign catapults the now-candidate Trump into a new era of legal risk and complicates his attempts to return to the White House.Here's what to know about the indictment and the case:THE FORMER PRESIDENT COULD HAVE A CRIMINAL RECORDTrump now faces threats to his freedom after decades of legal investigations that have never resulted in serious consequences.The Manhattan district attorney's office said Thursday that prosecutors had reached out to Trump's lawyers to arrange for him to surrender, which could happen early next week. Trump is expected to appear at the prosecutor's office to be processed and fingerprinted and have a mug shot taken. He is also expected to appear in court, when a judge would list the charges and Trump would enter a plea.He will have to contend with a criminal case while running again for the White House, taking time and attention away from the campaign trail — though neither the case nor a conviction would preclude him from seeking or winning the presidency in 2024.The indictment comes as he is facing several other investigations that could lead to legal problems for the former president. Those pending cases, along with a civil trial that's scheduled to start in New York next month over a columnist’s claims that Trump raped her in the 1990s, add to an ever-growing cloud of scandals surrounding him.CASE STEMS FROM HUSH MONEY PAID TO WOMENThe grand jury in Manhattan had been probing hush money payments at the height of the 2016 presidential campaign to two women who alleged sexual encounters with the former president. Trump’s former lawyer Michael Cohen, one of the witnesses who testified, says he orchestrated payments totaling $280,000 to porn actor Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal. Cohen pleaded guilty in 2018 to violating federal campaign finance law in connection with the payments. Federal prosecutors said the payments amounted to illegal, unreported assistance to Trump’s campaign. But they declined to file charges against Trump himself.The Manhattan district attorney’s office appeared to be investigating whether anyone committed crimes in arranging the payments, or in the way they accounted for them internally at the Trump Organization. But the specific charges remained under seal late Thursday.TRUMP MAINTAINS HIS INNOCENCETrump, who denies the sexual encounters, called the indictment “political persecution” and an attempt to interfere in his presidential campaign.Calling himself “a completely innocent person,” he cast the indictment as the latest in a line of actions that he says are designed to “destroy” his Make America Great Again movement, including his two presidential impeachments and the FBI search of his home that turned up classified documents.“The Democrats have lied, cheated and stolen in their obsession with trying to ‘Get Trump,’” he said in a statement.Earlier this month, Trump said his arrest was imminent and called on his supporters to protest. Last week, he warned about “potential death and destruction” if he were charged. His words evoked his comments ahead of the violent Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.Trump did not repeat his call to protest Thursday, but police forces around the country are on guard for potential unrest.OTHER INVESTIGATIONS CONTINUEBeyond the Manhattan case, Trump is facing an array of other investigations.On the federal level, the Justice Department is investigating the retention of top-secret government documents at his Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, and efforts by Trump and his allies to overturn the results of the 2020 election.The efforts by many of the same players in the latter case were also the subject of a special grand jury investigation in Georgia. The panel's foreperson said the special grand jury recommended multiple criminal indictments, leaving it up to Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, a Democrat, to decide whether to convene a regular grand jury and pursue criminal charges.With many serious cases looming around the other investigations, some legal experts have questioned the wisdom of the Manhattan case becoming the first to result in charges.TRUMP’S RIVALS CONDEMN INDICTMENTTrump has said the charges would actually help him in the 2024 presidential race and has tried to use the case to galvanize support. Last weekend, at the first rally of the campaign, he cast the Manhattan investigation and the other probes as the latest in a long line of political attacks against him. His campaign handed out signs that said “Witch Hunt” as Trump told his supporters that the legal challenges were also an attack on his followers and his political movement.Some Republican and independent voters could see the case, at the very least, as another example of problematic baggage that has followed Trump for years and has been a distraction. The news was expected to only fortify existing Democratic opposition to Trump.Republicans who are running against Trump or who are considering their own campaigns were quick to rally to criticize the case and attack Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, even if they didn't address the underlying allegations against Trump.Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is expected to announce a campaign and is seen as Trump’s top rival for the GOP nomination, called the indictment “un-American.” Former Vice President Mike Pence, also considering a challenge to Trump in 2024, called the indictment “an outrage.""GOP LAWMAKERS TARGET PROSECUTORRepublicans framed the arrest as a political prosecution by a rogue Democratic district attorney who they said was weaponizing the criminal justice system.House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said the House “will hold Alvin Bragg and his unprecedented abuse of power to account.”Some of Trump's fiercest supporters came to his defense. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and former Arizona gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake, two names floated as potential Trump running mates, said he’s innocent.BIDEN, DEMOCRATS HAVE LITTLE TO SAYDemocrats were less vocal in the hours after the indictment became known, but some of the former president's critics have framed the case as a long-overdue dose of accountability.President Joe Biden, who is expected to announce he’s running for reelection next year, has not commented on the indictment.The Democratic National Committee did not comment on the specifics of the case but sought to yoke the entire GOP to Trump.“No matter what happens in Trump’s upcoming legal proceedings, it’s obvious the Republican Party remains firmly in the hold of Donald Trump and MAGA Republicans,” DNC National Press Secretary Ammar Moussa said in a statement.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said: “Mr. Trump is subject to the same laws as every American. He will be able to avail himself of the legal system and a jury, not politics, to determine his fate according to the facts and the law.”House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., did not immediately comment, though some lesser-known House members welcomed the news.“I continue to believe that every American elected official and leader should be held fully accountable for their actions and crimes,” said Rep. Harley Rouda of California.“Finally, today, Donald Trump’s chickens have come home to roost,” said Rep. Raul Grijalva, who represents a safe district in Arizona. But his fellow Arizonan, Rep. Ruben Gallego, who is running for the Senate, was more measured: “We should wait to hear from the grand jury before jumping to conclusions.”___Cooper reported from Phoenix.",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852110,"Cron, Rockies rain homers on Padres for 7-2 opening win","SAN DIEGO (AP) — C.J. Cron homered twice and drove in five runs for the Colorado Rockies, who beat San Diego 7-2 on Thursday to dampen opening night of the most anticipated season in Padres history at chilly, wet Petco Park.Cron hit a go-ahead, three-run homer with one out in the fifth inning and added an opposite-field leadoff shot in the seventh for his 17th career multi-homer game. Elehuris Montero followed with another homer off reliever Domingo Tapia.Colorado had 17 hits, with the heart of the order collecting 10 — four by Cron and three apiece by Kris Bryant and Charlie Blackmon. The Rockies also struck out 17 times and committed three errors, including one by Cron at first base.Expectations are so high for the superstar-laden Padres, who made a stirring run to the NL Championship Series last year, that some in the sellout crowd of 45,103 booed when left fielder Juan Soto let Bryant's fly ball fall in for an RBI single in the sixth. There were more boos when Cron and Montero went back-to-back in the seventh.Germán Márquez (1-0) held San Diego to two runs and five hits in six innings.“I think you always try to quiet the crowd, especially early in the game,” said Rockies manager Bud Black, a former Padres skipper who still lives in the area in the offseason. ""I think that was big that we scored in the first inning. I mean, they came right back. The starting pitcher sets the tone for that, and if you score some runs, it keeps the momentum on your side and the crowd out of it.“They tried a couple times to rally but our pitchers snuffed it,” Black added. “But it’s a good crowd here.”Márquez said the atmosphere “was super exciting, but I told myself, like, ‘You have to calm down.'”As for pitching to a lineup with three superstars in a row, he said: “Believe me, it's not easy. I'm going to do my best to make good pitches and tonight was great.”Xander Bogaerts, who signed a $280 million, 11-year free agent deal in December, went 3 for 4 with two doubles in his Padres debut. Manny Machado, who finished second in NL MVP voting last year, had a sacrifice fly and a single. Soto, acquired last year at the trade deadline from Washington, went 0 for 4.The Padres' fourth superstar, Fernando Tatis Jr., is eligible to be activated on April 20 after finishing an 80-game suspension for testing positive for a performance-enhancing drug.Blake Snell (0-1), making his second career opening-day start, struck out nine through four innings before allowing singles to Yonathan Daza and Blackmon and leaving with a 2-1 lead in the fifth. Nabil Crismatt relieved and gave up Cron's shot to left field.Crismatt “throws a ton of changeups,” said Cron, who also hit an RBI single in the first. “It's a really good one and he kind of leans on it. I didn't expect four in a row or however many it was. I knew he was going to give me quite a few of them. It's tough against him because it's so good, but I finally got one I could hit.”The Padres decided Wednesday night to push back the scheduled start time 5 1/2 hours due to the threat of rain. There was a downpour about two hours before first pitch. It was raining in the first inning and there was a slight delay before the top of the second while the grounds crew worked on the field.TRAINER'S ROOMRockies: Placed closer Daniel Bard on the 10-day injured list due to anxiety and called up RHP Jake Bird. Bard said he has had anxiety both on and off the field.STARSJake Peavy, the 2007 NL Cy Young Award winner with the Padres, threw out the ceremonial first pitch to Padres right-hander Joe Musgrove, who's on the IL with a broken left big toe. Peavy was one of Musgrove's favorite players while growing up in suburban El Cajon and wears Peavy's No. 44. Peavy will be inducted into the Padres Hall of Fame in July. ... Tennis great Rod Laver, the last man to win the calendar-year Grand Slam, and former basketball star Ralph Sampson watched from Padres owner Peter Seidler's luxury suite.UP NEXTRockies LHP Kyle Freeland is scheduled to start Friday night against RHP Nick Martinez in the second game of the four-game series. Freeland was 9-11 with a 4.53 ERA last year while Martinez, who's moving into the rotation, was 4-4 with a 3.47 ERA in a hybrid role.___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/31,,World

The Pelicans tied Minnesota for seventh in the West with their sixth victory in seven games.“We know that they’re missing a huge component to the team in Jokic but it’s important for us no matter who’s on the floor we execute on both ends of the floor,” New Orleans coach Willie Green said. “I thought we did that.”Jokic was in street clothes due to lingering calf tightness that bothered him Monday night in a victory over Philadelphia.“When you’re playing with the MVP, things are a lot easier,"" Denver coach Michael Malone said.Jamal Murray had 21 points for Denver, and Bruce Brown added 19. The Nuggets lead in the Western Conference dropped to three games over Memphis with six to play.“I don't think about it that much, just trying to win ever night,” Brown said. “Because we've got a little lead we're focused on us trying to play our best every night.”Malone said after the game that Murray, who played 36 minutes, may not play Friday night in Phoenix and Jokic's status is to be determined.Malone added that Kentavious Caldwell-Pope was almost held out because he wasn't feeling good but he gutted out 28 minutes.Denver’s offense struggled without its leading scorer, rebounder and assist man, managing just 40 points in the first half on 34.8% shooting. The Nuggets were 4 of 28 from 3-point range on the night and scored 28 points below their season average.“We just didn’t make shots,” Brown said. “We shot 14 percent from three and terrible from the free-throw line. That was the game.”Two of Ingram's triple-doubles have come in the last five games.“He’s playing at a high level,” Green said. “Everybody’s getting the opportunity to see him display his game and we’re putting the ball in his hands a lot more, allowing him to be a playmaker.”TIP-INSPelicans: F Zion Williamson missed his 40th consecutive game with a hamstring injury.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852112,China's global influence looms over Harris trip to Africa,"LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) — When Vice President Kamala Harris arrived in Zambia on Friday for the final stop of her weeklong trip across Africa, she touched down at an airport that’s doubled in size and features glittering new terminals.Rather than a symbol of promising local development, it’s a reminder of China’s deep influence. Beijing financed the project, one of many that has expanded its footprint on a booming continent that's rich in natural resources, often generating goodwill among its citizens.The global rivalry between the United States and China has been a recurring backdrop for Harris’ journey, and nowhere has that been more apparent than Zambia and her previous stop in Tanzania.Besides the airport, China built a 60,000-seat stadium in Lusaka, plus roads and bridges around the country. Zambia is on the hook for all of the development with billions of dollars in debt. Tanzania is a major trading partner with China, and it has a new political leadership school funded by the Chinese Communist Party.The developments have alarmed Washington, and President Joe Biden’s administration is worried that Africa is slipping further into Beijing’s sphere of influence.Harris has played down the issue on her trip, preferring to focus on building partnerships independent of geopolitical competition. However, she has acknowledged there’s limited time for the U.S. to make inroads on the continent, telling reporters earlier in the trip that there is a “window” that is “definitely open now” for American investments.At a news conference with Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema on Friday, Harris reiterated her call for “all bilateral official creditors to provide a meaningful debt reduction for Zambia” — an oblique reference to China — but she stressed that “our presence here is not about China.”Hichilema said it would be “completely wrong” to view Zambia’s interests in terms of a rivalry between the U.S. and China.“When I’m in Washington, I’m not against Beijing. When I’m in Beijing, I’m not against Washington,” he said, adding that “none of these relationships are about working against someone or a group of countries.""China’s roots in both Tanzania and Zambia run deep. In the 1970s, Beijing built the Tazara Railway from landlocked Zambia to Tanzania’s Dar es Salaam port, allowing copper exports to circumvent white-minority-ruled Rhodesia and apartheid South Africa.Today, China is Africa’s largest two-way trading partner, with $254 billion of business in 2021, according to the United States Institute of Peace. That’s four times the amount of trade between the U.S. and Africa. In addition, dealing with Beijing features less admonishments about democracy than with Washington.“Most African countries are rightly unapologetic about their close ties to China,” Nigeria’s vice president, Yemi Osinbajo, tweeted on Thursday. “China shows up where and when the West will not and/or are reluctant.”Sen. Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat who has worked on Africa issues in Congress, expressed frustration over China’s growing influence on the continent.“We switched from being the No. 1 trade partner or the No. 1 investment partner in two dozen countries, to China being the No. 1 trade and investment partner,” he told reporters aboard Air Force Two on the flight to Ghana at the beginning of Harris’ trip. “I think our challenge for this decade is to address that.”Biden has been taking steps toward that, such as hosting a summit for African leaders in December, when he announced that he wants to commit $55 billion to the continent in the coming years.Harris has made announcements as well during her trip, including more than $1 billion in public and private money for economic development, $100 million for security assistance in West Africa and $500 million to facilitate trade with Tanzania.However, there’s skepticism about whether the U.S. will follow through on its promises, and Harris has been faced with not-so-subtle hints that Africa expects more. For example, the presidents of Ghana and Tanzania bluntly said they hope Biden chooses to visit their countries during his expected trip to Africa later this year, which would be his first to the continent as president.By comparison, Tanzania was among the first countries that Chinese President Xi Jinping visited after becoming president in 2013. And after Xi secured a third term, Tanzanian President Samia Suluhu Hassan was the first African head of state to visit Beijing.“Kamala faces Chinese dominance in Tanzania,” the Tanzania Business Insight publication tweeted Wednesday.Ian Johnson, a former China-based journalist who works at the U.S.-based Council on Foreign Relations, said Beijing presents a powerful narrative in the developing world as a country that rapidly built its economy and pulled much of its population out of poverty.African leaders think “let’s see what we can learn from China,” he said, adding that “there’s a certain fascination in how they did it.”Johnson also said China views Africa differently than the U.S.“We have a tendency to see Africa as a series of problems — wars, famines, something like that,” he said. ""But in China’s eyes, Africa is much more of an opportunity.”Edem Selormey, who conducts public opinion research at the Ghana Center for Democratic Development, said the feeling is often mutual.“China’s influence in Africa is largely seen as positive,” she said. “And the U.S. trails China in that regard.”The difference, she said, is often about “what citizens see on the ground,” such as infrastructure projects, and “the U.S. has been missing from this picture for a while.”John Kirby, a White House national security spokesman, said the debt that comes from China’s involvement is ultimately corrosive. He said African leaders are “beginning to realize that China is not really their friend.”“China’s interests in the region are purely selfish, as opposed to the United States,” he said.It’s a sentiment that draws scoffs in some corners of Africa.“America is like playing the role of a big Uncle Sam in trying to defend African countries against what they think is the encroachment of China into the liberty of African countries through these loans,” said Tanzania-based analyst Mohamed Issa Hemed.However, he added, “China is ahead of the U.S. in many, many ways.""Daniel Russel, a former State Department official who is now at the Asia Society Policy Institute, summed up the African perspective as “enough with the lectures” about China. “They’ve got something we want. And they’ve got it right here.”When it comes to U.S. hopes for Africa, he said, ”you can’t beat something with nothing.”___ Anna reported from Nairobi, Kenya, and Meldrum from Johannesburg.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852113,Shohei Ohtani strikes out 10 in Angels' opening loss to A's,"OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) — Shohei Ohtani's Pitchcom machine failed him for a stretch in the first inning, so he had to improvise with a rookie catcher.“It was tough because you want to go a different pitch, but you don't have enough fingers,” O'Hoppe said in reference to Ohtani's extensive repertoire. “We got through it, luckily.”Ohtani struck out 10 over six scoreless innings in his season debut coming off the World Baseball Classic title before Oakland capitalized once he exited, with Aledmys Díaz rallying the Athletics on a tiebreaking single in the eighth for a 2-1 win over the Los Angeles Angels on Thursday night.“We got a lot of guys on base and in scoring position, we just lacked that one big hit,” Ohtani said through interpreter Ippei Mizuhara.Esteury Ruiz singled and Tony Kemp hit a tying double to start the rally against Aaron Loup (0-1).The A's hoped to get a chance once Ohtani's day was done.“He kind of dominated us a little bit with 10 punchouts,” Oakland manager Mark Kotsay said. “In doing that, we knew what we were up against tonight. We wanted to get Ohtani out of the game as soon as possible. Took a little bit longer than what we would have liked, but we got to the bullpen and we were able to take advantage of that.”Ohtani called his own pitches using the Pitchcom technology as he also did during spring training given his range of offerings and the addition of the pitch clock this year. It started working again in the second inning.O’Hoppe singled in the fifth to break up a scoreless game and put the Angels ahead. Then, Los Angeles right fielder Hunter Renfroe made an amazing no-look catch for the opening day highlight reels.Ohtani raised his arms in delight from the mound and Renfroe could only grin ear to ear after robbing Oakland’s Jace Peterson with a defensive gem to start the bottom of the fifth. Running backward toward the wall, Renfroe reached his glove up and made the grab without his eyes tracking the ball and landed just in front of the warning track.“WHAT WAS THAT” the Angels posted on Twitter with a shocked emoji face.“There’s no normal catch about it. You catch it behind your head and backwards — that’s not great but you gotta do what you gotta do sometimes,” Renfroe said.Ohtani — unfazed after walking Kemp on four pitches to start his outing — pumped his first when he retired Ramón Laureano on a 101-mph pitch to end the fourth. He walked three and allowed two hits.Ohtani joined Dylan Cease, Gerrit Cole and Logan Webb as four pitchers with double-digit strikeouts, matching 1970 for the most on opening day since 1901.New A's reliever Trevor May (1-0) pitched the eighth for the win. Dany Jimenez earned the save after putting the tying run aboard on a walk.Gio Urshela struck out swinging to end the seventh after a 10-pitch battle with Oakland reliever Domingo Acevedo.OPENER FUNKThe Angels extended their franchise-record losing streak on opening day to six straight, falling to 2-7 all-time in openers against the A's and 0-6 in Oakland. The A's have won five straight season openers in the series.O'HOPPE'S DAYO’Hoppe, the club's lone rookie on the opening day roster, became the youngest catcher to start opening day in franchise history at 23 years, 49 days. Buck Rodgers was the previous youngest at 23 years, 237 days old in 1962. O’Hoppe also became the first rookie catcher to start opening day for the Angels since Bengie Molina in 2000.In the stands cheering O'Hoppe were his parents, Angela and Michael, twin sister Mel and a group of close friends.UP NEXTRHP Shintaro Fujinami makes his major league debut for the A's on Saturday.

The left-hander allowed four hits and two runs in six innings. He struck out six.“It was an unforgettable experience,” Urías said through a translator. “It was really special to me.”All three of Smith's hits went to right field in a game that lasted 2 hours, 35 minutes under new rules this season designed to speed things up.The game-time temperature was 55 degrees — 15 degrees lower than Los Angeles’ average of 70 in March. Batting practice was rained out and the tarp covered the infield. But the clouds cleared before first pitch, revealing rare snow atop the San Gabriel Mountains that frame the outfield.The Dodgers won a franchise-record 111 games last season only to lose to the rival San Diego Padres in their National League Division Series. They bid farewell to Trea Turner, Justin Turner and Cody Bellinger in the offseason, helping make the roster a bit younger.Outman is part of that youth movement, having made the opening-day roster off a strong spring showing. The 25-year-old center fielder hammered a two-run shot to left-center in the sixth, extending the lead to 7-2.“I don’t think any moment is going to be too big for him,” Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. “He’s just got a quiet confidence.”Outman went 2 for 3 with three runs, a walk and a strikeout in his first career game at Dodger Stadium.“It was really fun to get the season going with a win,” said Outman, admitting to having some nerves early. “I couldn't stay still when they were doing all the name announcements.”Mookie Betts made the defensive play of the game in the sixth. Ketel Marte singled to right, Betts picked up the ball barehanded and in one motion made a two-hop throw to get Marte stretching at second.The Dodgers broke open a 2-all game in the fifth. Smith had an RBI single, J.D. Martinez's RBI single chased Zac Gallen, and David Peralta singled off Cole Sulser to give Los Angeles a 5-2 lead.Gallen (0-1) gave up six hits and five runs in 4 2/3 innings. He struck out seven and walked three.Arizona led 2-0 on Christian Walker's RBI single in the first and Gabriel Moreno's sacrifice fly in the second.TRAINER'S ROOMDodgers RHP Ryan Pepiot (oblique strain) went on the injured list. Michael Grove will start in his place Monday.CLOCK VIOLATIONUnder baseball's new rules, the Diamondbacks were called for a pitch-timer violation in the eighth.

Their catchers were Roberts and former backstops Rick Dempsey and Mike Scioscia. Watching from the owner’s box was 87-year-old Sandy Koufax, a three-time Cy Young Award winner.OUCH!Dodgers third baseman Max Muncy struck out all five times up.TOASTING A NEW SEASONNew outfielder Jason Heyward put bottles of wine in the lockers of his Dodgers teammates and coaches on opening night of the season.

This caused concern the communist country might try to interfere and block Taiwan’s access.The Japanese evening paper Yukan Fuji and its web edition Zakzak headlined “United Kingdom joins CPTPP, next Taiwan” above a report about President Tsai Ing-wen’s (蔡英文) ongoing visit to the United States.All 11 member nations need to agree on any application, but some opposition to Taiwan’s case might come from Southeast Asian nations regarded as friendly to China. Beijing was likely to step up pressure to keep Taiwan out even before it joined, per the Liberty Times.Another unpredictable factor is the likelihood of the United States returning to the group, while other countries such as Uruguay have also applied to join. With the U.K. likely to become a CPTPP member later this year, attention would shift to Taiwan and how the current 11 member nations dealt with its application.Earlier, National Development Council (NDC) Minister Kung Ming-hsin (龔明鑫) said Taiwan could reasonably expect to join within five years.",2023/03/31,723,Politics
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852148,Baldwin codefendant gets 6 months probation on gun charge,"SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) — A codefendant in the case against actor Alec Baldwin in the fatal 2021 shooting of a cinematographer on a movie set in New Mexico was convicted Friday of unsafe handling of a firearm and sentenced to six months of probation.Safety coordinator and assistant director David Halls also must pay a $500 fine, complete a gun-safety course and 24 hours of community service after agreeing to the conviction related to the death of Halyna Hutchins on the set of the Western movie “Rust.”Under the plea agreement, Halls agreed to testify truthfully at any upcoming hearings or trials. That includes criminal proceedings against Baldwin and movie armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, who have pleaded not guilty to charges of involuntary manslaughter in Hutchins' death.Halls appeared briefly by video to waive his right to challenge the negligence charge, as state District Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer approved terms of a plea agreement with prosecutors.Defense attorney Lisa Torraco urged the court not to impose a prison sentence — the maximum possible penalty was 6 months behind bars — noting that Halls was “extremely traumatized and “rattled” with guilt.Hutchins died shortly after she was shot on Oct. 21, 2021, during rehearsals on a film-set ranch on the outskirts of Santa Fe. Baldwin was pointing a pistol at Hutchins when the weapon went off; a single live round killed her and wounded director Joel Souza.If convicted of involuntary manslaughter, Baldwin and Gutierrez-Reed could face a maximum penalty of 18 months in prison and fines.Torraco said Halls had checked the rounds in the revolver before handing it to Baldwin to see whether they were dummies or blanks with an explosive. She said it was “never in anyone's imagination"" that live rounds would be in the gun.“When Ms. Gutierrez-Reed brought the firearm ... on set into the church, he did check the firearm,” she said of Halls. ”He wouldn’t have even thought that there was a live round in that, in that gun. ... And he, like many others, is extremely traumatized.""But prosecutor Kari Morrissey said Halls, a veteran filmmaker of more than 30 years, failed in his duty as the last line of defense for firearms safety, and that the fatal shooting took place after two earlier weapons misfires on set.“Mr. Halls did not check every round that was in the gun to confirm that it was a dummy round and not a live round,” she said. “He then handed the gun to Mr. Baldwin and Mr. Baldwin began to practice his cross draw. And during that action of practicing the cross draw, the gun went off. And obviously Mrs. Hutchins was struck by the bullet and was killed. That is the factual basis for Mr. Halls taking the no contest plea to the unsafe handling of a deadly weapon.”In separate regulatory proceedings, workplace safety authorities have asserted Halls shared responsibility for identifying and correcting any hazardous conditions related to firearms safety in the movie's production.Halls' sentencing took place on the 30th anniversary of the death of Brandon Lee. The son of martial-arts legend Bruce Lee was hit by a .44-caliber slug from a gun that was supposed to have fired a blank while filming “The Crow.”A weekslong preliminary hearing in May will decide whether evidence against Baldwin and Gutierrez-Reed is sufficient to proceed to trial.In her sentencing, Judge Marlowe Sommer confirmed with Halls that he would “testify truthfully in all hearings, trials, or settings involving any and all defendants and co-defendants in this matter.” Prosecutors can reopen the case if Halls violates the terms of the plea agreement.Santa Fe’s district attorney this week appointed two special prosecutors, Morrissey and Jason Lewis.The original special prosecutor, Andrea Reeb, resigned following missteps in the initial filing of charges against Baldwin and objections that her role as a state legislator created conflicting responsibilities.",2023/04/01,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852150,Japan FM to visit China as Tokyo imposes new export controls,"TOKYO (AP) — Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi said Friday he will visit China this weekend for talks with his counterpart Qin Gang, becoming Japan's first top diplomat to do so in more than three years amid growing friction between the two countries, including new Japanese export controls and the detention of a Japanese national in Beijing.Hayashi hopes to “engage in a candid and in-depth exchange of views toward establishing a constructive and stable relationship” in the talks with Qin and other officials during his April 1-2 visit, he told a news conference.His trip comes after Japan announced Friday that it will tighten export controls on 23 materials used for semiconductor manufacturing, seen as an effort to limit China's access to advanced chipmaking technology, a step sought by the United States.Hayashi is expected to demand the release of the detained Japanese national, discuss security concerns in the region and ask China to act “responsibly” on global issues including Russia's war on Ukraine.He noted an agreement between the leaders of the two countries to build constructive and stable ties. “Japan-China relations are facing many challenges and concerns, although there are various possibilities"" for cooperation, Hayashi said.Despite close economic and business ties between the two Asian powers, Tokyo and Beijing have been increasingly at odds in recent years as Japan considers China’s growing influence in the region a threat to its national security and economy.“I believe it is important to build a constructive and stable relationship while we insist on our position on some issues, seek (China's) responsible actions and continue our dialogue,” Hayashi said.A visit by his predecessor, Toshimitsu Motegi, in 2019 was the last to China by a top Japanese diplomat, just prior to China's near-total closure of its borders amid strict pandemic control measures.Commenting on Hayashi’s visit, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said it was in the “common interests of the two sides and the region to maintain the sound and stable development of China-Japan relations.”Mao said Qin and other Chinese leaders would “have an in-depth exchange on bilateral relations and regional and international issues of mutual concern.”However, in a reminder of the underlying tensions, Mao also criticized the new Japanese restrictions on exports of semiconductor manufacturing materials to China.“Politicizing ... and weaponizing sci-tech and trade issues and intentionally undermining the stability of global supply and industrial chains would only hurt others as well as oneself,” she said.Japan is among the U.S. allies that have followed Washington in restricting Beijing’s access to the sensitive technologjes.Japanese Economy and Trade Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura said the export controls were imposed to prevent the materials from being diverted to military use. He said the decision was made “to fulfill Japan's global responsibility as a country possessing advanced chip technology” and not to target China or follow the U.S. move. Japan consulted with the United States, the Netherlands and other like-minded countries, Nishimura said.An addition point of friction between the two sides is China's detention of an employee of the Japanese pharmaceutical company Astellas Pharma earlier this month on suspicion of spying. Japan's government has demanded his release and an explanation.China's Foreign Ministry said the Japanese citizen is suspected of “engaging in espionage activities in violation of the criminal law ... and the Anti-Espionage Law of the People’s Republic of China.""Mao offered no new information about the case but said the detainee's legal rights would be protected and that he would have access to Japanese consular officials.More than a dozen Japanese citizens with business or other connections to China have been arrested in the past over allegations including spying.A long-festering dispute over uninhabited East China Sea islands controlled by Japan but claimed by China also flared again in mid-March, with both sides accusing the other of infringing on their maritime territory.The islands are known as the Senkakus in Japanese and Diaoyu in Chinese. Taiwan also claims the islands but has forged agreements with Japan to avoid such conflicts.China routinely sends coast guard vessels and planes into waters and airspace surrounding the islands to harass Japanese vessels in the area and force Japan to scramble jets in response.Japan considers China a threat to its national and regional security and has been expanding its security cooperation with other “like-minded” countries in the region and Europe, as well as with NATO, while promoting a vision of a “free and open Indo-Pacific"" as a counter to China.Hayashi said Friday he will travel to Brussels after his China visit to attend a NATO foreign ministers’ meeting to reaffirm Japan's commitment to the rules-based international order and reinforce cooperation between Japan and NATO in their response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and other key issues.Japan is also concerned about growing joint military exercises between China and Russia around Japan's coasts.Also Friday, China's Defense Ministry said it was setting up a direct telephone connection with its Japanese counterpart to “strengthen the capabilities of the two sides to manage and control maritime and air crises.”The Chinese ministry has a similar hotline with the Pentagon. However, after the U.S. shooting down of a suspected Chinese spy balloon in February, China refused to accept a phone call from U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to discuss the matter, threatening unspecified retaliation instead.___AP videojournalist Haruka Nuga contributed to this report.",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852151,"Storms strike Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana; 7 reported dead","LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) — A monster storm system tore through the South and Midwest on Friday, spawning deadly weather including tornadoes that shredded homes and shopping centers in Arkansas, collapsed a theater roof during a heavy metal concert in Illinois and made a fatal sweep into rural Indiana.The storm caused three deaths in Sullivan County, Indiana, Emergency Management Director Jim Pirtle said in an email to The Associated Press early Saturday. The storm damaged homes and some residents were missing in the county seat of Sullivan, located near the Illinois state line about 95 miles (152 kilometers) southwest of Indianapolis.At least one person was killed and more than two dozen were hurt, some critically, in the Little Rock area, authorities said. The town of Wynne in northeastern Arkansas was also devastated, and officials reported two dead there, along with destroyed homes and people trapped in the debris.Authorities said a theater roof collapsed during a tornado in Belvidere, Illinois, killing one person and injuring 28, five of them severely. The Belvidere Police Department said the collapse occurred as a heavy storm rolled through the area and that calls began coming from the theater at 7:48 p.m. It said that an initial assessment was that a tornado had caused the damage.The collapse occurred at the Apollo Theatre during a heavy metal concert in the town located about 70 miles (113 kilometers) northwest of Chicago. The venue's Facebook page said the bands scheduled to perform were Morbid Angel, Crypta, Skeletal Remains and Revocation.Belvidere Fire Department Chief Shawn Schadle said 260 people were in the venue. He said first responders also rescued someone from an elevator and had to grapple with downed power lines outside the theater.Belvidere Police Chief Shane Woody described the scene after the collapse as “chaos, absolute chaos.”Gabrielle Lewellyn had just entered the theater when a portion of the ceiling collapsed.“I was there within a minute before it came down,” she told WTVO-TV. “The winds, when I was walking up to the building, it went like from zero to a thousand within five seconds.”Some people rushed to lift the collapsed portion of the ceiling and pull people out of the rubble, said Lewellyn, who wasn’t hurt.“They dragged someone out from the rubble and I sat with him and I held his hand and I was (telling him) ‘It’s going to be OK.’ I didn’t really know much else what to do.”There were more confirmed twisters in Iowa and wind-whipped grass fires blazed in Oklahoma, as the storm system threatened a broad swath of the country home to some 85 million people.The destructive weather came as President Joe Biden toured the aftermath of a deadly tornado that struck in Mississippi one week ago and promised the government would help the area recover.The Little Rock tornado tore first through neighborhoods in the western part of the city and shredded a small shopping center that included a Kroger grocery store. It then crossed the Arkansas River into North Little Rock and surrounding cities, where widespread damage was reported to homes, businesses and vehicles.In the evening, officials in Pulaski County announced a confirmed fatality in North Little Rock but did not immediately give details.Baptist Health Medical Center-Little Rock officials told KATV in the afternoon that 21 people had checked in there with tornado-caused injuries, including five in critical condition.Mayor Frank Scott Jr., who announced that he was requesting assistance from the National Guard, tweeted in the evening that property damage was extensive and “we are still responding.”Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders activated 100 members of the Arkansas National Guard to help local authorities respond to the damage throughout the state.In Little Rock, resident Niki Scott took cover in the bathroom after her husband called to say a tornado was headed her way.

Framed Salmon Captures Over 80% Revenue Share of Global Salmon Market
Farmed salmon is a major contributor to the global salmon market, generating over 80% of the industry’s revenue. As the demand for salmon continues to rise worldwide, the farming of salmon has become a significant industry with a variety of opportunities and trends. The total number of salmon farms around the globe is difficult to estimate, as it varies by country and region. However, according to the FAO, there were approximately 2,200 salmon farms in Norway in 2020, and the country produced over 1.4 million tons of farmed salmon. Other major producers of farmed salmon include Chile, Scotland, and Canada.
The cost of farmed salmon production varies depending on the location and the type of farming methods used. According to a report by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the average cost of producing farmed salmon in Norway, which is the world’s largest producer, is approximately $5 per kilogram. In other countries, the cost tends to be higher due to factors such as labor costs, feed costs, and regulatory compliance.
As per Astute Analytica, one of the significant opportunities in the farmed salmon market is the increasing demand for sustainably produced seafood. This trend has led to the development of more environmentally friendly and efficient farming practices, such as land-based farming and closed-containment systems. These methods reduce the impact of fish farming on the environment and provide a higher-quality product for consumers.
Another trend in farmed salmon market is the development of new feed sources. Traditional fish meal and fish oil are commonly used in salmon feed, but alternative sources such as plant-based proteins and insect-based proteins are being explored as more sustainable options.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852205,"Robotaxi Market Analysis, Key Players Profiles, Future Prospects and Forecasts to 2031","According to the report by Report Ocean, the global Robotaxi market is growing at a high Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 69.4% due to several factors such as increasing concerns towards carbon emission, depletion of non-renewable fuel, and a growing focus towards better traffic management. The report suggests that the market was valued at USD 0.5 billion in 2021 and is expected to earn revenue of around USD 20.3 billion by the end of 2028. The growth in the market is attributed to the technological advances made by Robotaxi companies and increased trust in autonomous vehicles.Download Free Sample of This Strategic Report: https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=MR362Moreover, the report suggests that concerns regarding carbon emissions and depletion of non-renewable fuel are driving the market for Robotaxi worldwide. Additionally, improvements in traffic management are expected to further boost market growth during the forecast period. However, growing concerns about the security of Robotaxi may act as a major hindrance to its market growth.In summary, the report highlights the high growth potential of the global Robotaxi market, driven by various factors such as technological advancements, concerns towards carbon emissions and non-renewable fuel, and the need for better traffic management. However, security concerns could potentially impede the growth of the market in the future.Increasing Demand for Electric Robotaxi Propelling the Global Robotaxi MarketBased on propulsion type, the robotaxi market is grouped into electric and fuel cell segments. The electric propulsion segment accounts for the largest market share. The growth of the segment can be ascribed to the various advantages electric vehicles offer over fuel cells, such as zero-emission, low maintenance and operating cost, as well as higher efficiency, which is propelling its market growth. Furthermore, increasing installations of charging points in various regions are anticipated to boost the penetration of electric robotaxis on roads during the forecast period.Robotaxis for Car Rental Applications are Expected to Boost the Market’s GrowthBased on service types, the robotaxi market is grouped into car rental and station-based segments. The car rental segment holds the largest market share. Certain countries, such as China, have already begun testing driverless taxis in their major cities. Moreover, cab companies, such as Uber, are investing in robotaxis for car rental to reduce their operating costs incurred by human drivers. Furthermore, the development of Transportation-as-a-Service (TaaS) is also providing lucrative growth opportunities for robotaxis in the car rental services sector.Global Robotaxi Market – By ComponentBased on components, the robotaxi market is segmented into the camera, LiDAR, radar, and ultrasonic sensors. Among these, the LiDAR component segment accounts for the largest market share. LiDAR sensors radiate light particles called photons in order to identify objects nearby, including cars, pedestrians, and trees. LiDAR sensors allow robotaxi to operate without human drivers by communicating with its system and adjusting speed accordingly. Consequently, the demand for LiDAR components is rising rapidly.Request To Download Sample of This Strategic Report:- https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=MR362Global Robotaxi Market – Regional InsightsGeographically, the robotaxi market is segmented into North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, Latin America, Middle-East & Africa. Among these, the Asia-Pacific dominates the robotaxi market. However, North America is also estimated to witness substantial growth during the forecast period owing to the high concentration of major industry players, such as Tesla, Uber, Waymo, etc., that are investing significant amounts in the launch and development of robotaxis. Further, stringent government regulations regarding carbon emission and initiatives to boost the adoption of electric vehicles are projected to boost North Americas robotaxi market during the forecast period.Impact of COVID-19 on the Global Robotaxi MarketThe global robotaxi market experienced a significant blow due to the COID-19-induced pandemic.

This market is growing due to the increasing demand for household water treatment systems, which is a result of the rising water pollution and population influx in urban areas. In this report, we will analyze the market solutions, advancements, applications, benefits, and operations of the North America household water treatment system market.Market Size and Growth: According to a recent study by the strategic consulting and market research firm Report Ocean, the North America household water treatment systems market was worth USD 4,547.1 million in 2021. The market is anticipated to grow at a significant CAGR of 6.8% during the forecast period of 2022-2027. The market is mainly supported by the rapid growth in the residential sector, where household water treatment systems are used to treat water in houses. Home water supply systems obtain water from a treatment plant and make it available to all appliances and fixtures.Download Free Sample of This Strategic Report: https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=MR360Drivers: The increasing water pollution and population influx in urban areas are the main drivers of the North America household water treatment system market. With the growth of industrialization and urbanization, water pollution has become a significant concern in North America. This has led to an increase in the demand for household water treatment systems, which can purify water and make it safe for consumption. Additionally, the rising population influx in urban areas has also increased the demand for household water treatment systems, as the municipal water supply is unable to meet the growing demand for clean water.Benefits: Household water treatment systems have several benefits. They help in removing impurities, bacteria, and viruses from water, making it safe for consumption. This ensures the health and well-being of individuals and families. Additionally, household water treatment systems also help in reducing the cost of bottled water and provide a continuous supply of clean water. They are also environment-friendly, as they reduce the use of plastic bottles and contribute to the reduction of plastic waste.Conclusion: In conclusion, the North America household water treatment system market is thriving and is projected to reach a worth of USD 6,559.4 million by 2027. The market is driven by the increasing water pollution and population influx in urban areas. Household water treatment systems have several benefits, including the removal of impurities and viruses, providing a continuous supply of clean water, and being environment-friendly. As a result, the demand for these systems is likely to increase in the future, and the market is expected to witness significant growth during the forecast period.Government Initiatives For Subsidizing Water Treatment Systems Bolstering The Growth Of The MarketAs reported by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the US government has started focusing on the challenges rural communities in the United States face when it comes to clean drinking water. EPA announced in October 2021 that the agency will sanction a grant worth USD 21.7 million to provide training and technical assistance to rural communities across the United States that require small drinking water treatment systems. The funding is expected to enhance public health by providing communities with safer drinking water and ensuring wastewater is treated properly. The allocations in the United States and Canada are creating a growing focus on the development of Water Treatment Systems that will help vulnerable communities get access to clean water that is free from any contaminants, further boosting the demand for household water treatment systems.Higher Equipment, Maintenance & Installation Costs Anticipated to Impede Market GrowthAlthough water filters and treatment systems may provide greater access to safe drinking water, they do come with a higher cost. The average cost of a water treatment system is around USD 2000, which includes installation, labor, and other costs. According to the study conducted byReport Ocean such higher costs may not appear high for financial fit societies across the North America. Water supply systems that provide extensive water supply for the whole house (point of entry) may cost around USD 9000. Additionally, the maintenance costs of the water filtration and treatment systems installed at home can range from USD 200 to USD 800. While these systems have a good lifespan, they may require frequent membrane replacements, filter replacements, and accompanying labor costs in areas where groundwater contamination occurs, therefore proving less useful than government-provided tap water.Request To Download Sample of This Strategic Report:- https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=MR360Impact of COVID-19 on the North America Household Water Treatment System MarketCOVID-19 has moderately affected the adoption of water treatment systems across the North America.. Due to the lockdown restrictions, consumers had to suffer some financial loss, disrupting their budgeting plans, which negatively affected the demand for water treatment systems to be installed in the households. However, the positive impact registered was the growth and exposure of clean water technologies across North America. Amidst COVID-19, several firms had to reduce their production and water usage due to supply chain disruptions and economic volatility, significantly impacting the commercial market for point of entry water treatment systems. Furthermore, due to the prevailing condition of COVID-19, many players are opting for online sales channels. In the second wave of pandemic, the bottled water delivery system was slightly impacted due to the concern of disease transmission. People across the globe, including North America, shift from bottled water delivery systems to water treatment systems for contactless water treatment in the household, which propelled the demand for household water treatment systems across North America.Whole House Sediment Water Filter Accounted For Lucrative Market Share in the North America Household Water Treatment System MarketBased on products, the North America household water treatment system market is segmented into Countertop Reverse Osmosis Water Filter System, Ultra-Filtration Under Sink Water Filter System, Faucet Water Filtration System, Water Filter Pitcher, Refrigerator-Water-Filter-Replacement, Pool & Spa Filter Cartridge, and Whole House Sediment Water Filter. Among these, the whole house sediment water filter segment accounted for the largest share in 2021, followed by the countertop reverse osmosis water filter system segment, which held a lucrative market share in 2021. Counter-top filtration systems are becoming increasingly popular due to their ease of use, maintenance, and installation. Furthermore, these devices reduce contaminants such as bacteria, dirt, chlorine, particulates, rust, lead, mercury, silt, copper, benzene, cadmium, and cysts present in water.The United States Dominates the North America Household Water Treatment System MarketNorth America household water treatment system market is segmented into the United States, Canada, and Mexico based on country. The United States accounted for the largest share in the market in 2021 and is expected to grow at a significant CAGR during the forecast period. Followed by the United States, Canada is anticipated to grow at a higher CAGR during the forecast period. The residential sector in Canada is thriving due to Canada’s emerging economy. In Canada, residential real estate transactions totaled 486,800 in 2019, a 6.2% increase from a five-year low in 2018. The figure reflects increasing activity in Ontario and Quebec, where activity climbed by 9% and 11%, respectively.

The report also examines the regulations and policies that the industry has implemented. The report discusses the industry’s research technology and potential future advancements in the USA Wetland Management industry.The USA wetland management market held a market value of USD 355.79 million in 2021 and is likely to reach USD 1,010.95 million by the year 2030. The market is anticipated to register a CAGR of 13.1% during the forecast period.Request To Download Sample of This Strategic Report:- https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=ARS364Wetlands are typically a transition between terrestrial and aquatic systems, and there are no natural borders between them, therefore they cannot be described in terms of a specific land type. Determining these wetlands’ borders might still be difficult because they are dispersed over such a broad area in the United States. These therefore depend on the properties of the vegetation and ground. Additionally, if there is steeper terrain, determining the borders is much simpler.Over the coming years, this market will expand due to rising demand for wetlands conservation and preservation as well as developments in wastewater treatment technology. Sewage water treatment, stormwater detention and retention, erosion control along shorelines, and groundwater recharge are a few of the frequent uses for wetland management in residential areas. Before surface runoff enters larger waterways or sewers, wetlands filter off the silt. By doing this, contaminants that might harm populations downstream is kept out of local watersheds.The commercial sector utilises wetlands in a strategic way. Prior to being discharged into a river or the ocean, contaminants from drinking water and wastewater are removed in wetlands. Wetland treatment removes substances like nitrogen and phosphorus that, if left untreated, could later result in an algal bloom. These facilities also remove heavy metals like mercury or lead, which can be harmful to humans when consumed in fish at certain levels. Because wetlands act as a natural barrier against flooding and other natural calamities, wetland management is also used in municipal applications. Municipal wetlands are frequently employed in flood prevention strategies. Additionally, they might be built to lessen the danger of coastal flooding and soil erosion. These wetlands provide habitat for biodiversity while filtering pollutants before they reach natural water sources, assisting in the maintenance of a healthy watershed. Urban wetland systems can help stormwater management in addition to preventing flooding by lowering peak flows during rainstorm events, bioremediating suspended particles, etc.Growth Influencers:Declining Wetland Areas

However, the high-performance application coupled with high initial cost and the lack of raw material availability & stringent regulations is anticipated to negatively hamper the market growth.Growth Influencers:Conventional abrasives substituted by super abrasivesConventional abrasives include silicon carbide and corundum, among others. They are natural grains usually blended or fuelled with other abrasive grains so that the grinding wheel can perform as required. On the other hand, super abrasives use synthetic or natural diamonds or CBN, a synthetic grain. They have substituted conventional abrasives, as they can run at higher speeds, and their thermal stability is also higher. This also adds to their long life. They also require less dressing as compared to their conventional counterparts due to their durability. For instance, if a manufacturer has 30 to 40 parts per dress with a conventional abrasive, they have 1,200 parts per dress for a CBN abrasive. This makes it ideal for high-volume environments as well. All these factors are expected to positively influence market growth.Usage of diamond in grinding wheels for machining and precision toolsDiamond is the most used precision tool grinding method for cutting tools which are utilized for making stamping dies, precision machinery components, and injection molds. The diamond is grown on industrial scales to supply the tremendous demand of the metalworking industry globally. These diamonds are also more uniform in shape as well as hardness, as compared to natural diamonds. Furthermore, diamonds are significantly harder than conventional abrasives, such as silicon carbide and aluminum oxide. Such factors are anticipated to fuel growth in super abrasives market.Segments Overview:The global Super Abrasives market is segmented into product, application, and industry.By Product

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852274,"1 year ago, scenes of horror emerged from Ukraine's Bucha","BUCHA, Ukraine (AP) — The cratered roads have been repaved and the damaged houses are gradually being repaired. But the scenes that emerged from this town near Kyiv a year ago, after it was retaken from Russian forces, have indelibly linked its name to the savagery of war.On the northwestern fringes of the Ukrainian capital, Bucha had been occupied by Russian troops for about a month, taken as they swept toward Kyiv at the start of the invasion of Ukraine that began in late February 2022. When they withdrew, they left behind scenes of horror.Bodies of civilians lay where they had fallen, beside their bicycles, in their cars, on the sides of roads, in yards, buildings and homes.“They were bodies of people in civilian clothing — women, old men, younger men” scattered in the streets, said Associated Press photographer Vadim Ghirda, one of the first journalists to enter Bucha right after the Russian withdrawal.Many appeared to not have been dead for very long, looking almost as if they were sleeping, Ghirda said. Others seemed to have been executed, found with their hands tied behind their backs.Over the next few days, AP photographers documented scenes of devastation in Bucha, where the events are being investigated as war crimes. Stunned residents emerged from their basements to find destroyed tanks and military vehicles littering the streets.More bodies were found inside homes, others were unearthed from a mass grave. In the following weeks and months, hundreds of bodies were uncovered, including some of children. Not all have been identified.___Follow AP's coverage of the war in Ukraine: https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852275,Poor Albanian town pins tourism hopes on communist tunnels,"KUKES, Albania (AP) — If you'd like to walk for miles in concrete burrows built to defend an isolationist totalitarian regime that nobody wanted to attack, Kukes in northeastern Albania is the place for you.The small Balkan country's post World War II communist dictatorship reveled in massive defensive works; the countryside is still littered with the crumbling remains of 175,000 concrete mini-bunkers — again built to stop imaginary invaders. But Kukes' tunnels take the prize.Dug from the 1970s to the early 1990s — just in time for the communist regime's collapse — the underground network was meant to house the town's entire population of 16,000 for up to six months in case of war. Equipped with amenities running from a prosecutor's office to a maternity clinic, it was Albania's biggest fortification project with tunnels extending for up to seven kilometers (4 miles).Now, local authorities hope to turn it into a tourist attraction, with the help of European Union funding. By the end of the year, they say, a multi-room command center and a long tunnel leading to it from the town hall should be accessible.Post-communist Albania remains one of Europe's poorest countries. Tourism is a major earner, generating 17% of GDP in 2021, while arrivals increased 33% in 2022 to reach some 7.5 million people.Tourists would be particularly welcome in Kukes, a town 150 kilometers (90 miles) northeast of the capital Tirana, close to the Kosovo border. It's Albania's poorest area, despite its mineral riches and striking mountain scenery, from which most of the young people emigrate — many heading abroad.Kukes Mayor Safet Gjici said potential tourists would be offered gastronomical experiences as well as the tunnel experience.“Such a museum town will show the local values of the population and attract visitors, bring money for the town hall and employment for the people,” he said.Older local residents have vivid memories of the complex, which was built largely with mass local labor and was only used once in a civil defense drill, in the late 1980s, which sent the entire Kukes population underground.An alarm bell rang at night. The town’s mayor and party leader met at a tunnel entrance below their offices and walked four kilometers to reach the command center.Armida Alikaj, who was 10 years old at the time, said her father calmly woke her up and each got a backpack with clothes, food and blankets, to go to the tunnels with “the smell of the earth” and slogans and numbers painted in white lime on the doors.“I was not afraid because we were told they were built for us,” she said. “But the siren’s noise was horrible.”Kukes is a relatively new town of Soviet-style white brick five-story flats built from scratch — with the tunnel warren — to house some 16,000 people after the old town was swallowed up in 1978 by an artificial lake designed to fuel a hydropower plant.Each apartment building's residents had their defined place in the tunnels with good air circulation and water supply.There was also a bread factory, a school, a hospital, a maternity home, prosecutor’s office, police station, radio station, printing house for the communist propaganda, as well as classrooms for children and spaces for men and women to undergo training in shooting and other military skills.Albania’s communist dictator Enver Hoxha cut ties with neighboring Yugoslavia in 1949, with the Soviet Union in 1961 and with China in 1978. His fear of invasion led the regime to spend about 5% of its annual budget on the military.Retired army officer Haxhi Cenaj, 81, says he spent hours underground in the 37-room Kukes command center as military leaders plotted their strategy, preparing for a Yugoslavian attack that never came.Until he retired in 1995, Cenaj was a major leading a small infantry unit assigned to protect the center.His son, Afrim, who now takes care of a small part of the tunnels, points out the lights on the cold walls, the concrete tables and lavatories. Small groups of bats cluster on ceilings.“Many British, Swiss, Dutch, or French (people) come to Kukes only to see the tunnels,” he said.Bukurosh Onuzi, a tourist expert in charge of the museum project, said there is ""much interest in the complex, especially from foreigners but also from (Albanian) youngsters who have no knowledge, no information or have not lived under communism.”Cenaj, the former army major, says he fondly remembers his time spent underground.“We tried scenarios, provocations. We planned there would be a war, likely an air attack, and trained how to survive,” he said. “I would prefer to have (the underground network) ready still. Who knows what is happening with (the) wars around.”—— Follow Llazar Semini at https://twitter.com/lsemini",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852276,World Bank says recoveries in Asian economies losing steam,"BANGKOK (AP) — Developing economies in Asia have mostly regained ground lost during the pandemic but are seeing their recoveries stall as productivity lags, the World Bank said in a report released Friday.The report forecasts that growth in the region including China will pick up pace this year after the world's No. 2 economy relaxed pandemic restrictions on travel and other activities. But recoveries elsewhere in the region, excluding China, will moderate as pressures of inflation and growing household debt slow consumer spending, it said.Across the Asia-Pacific, economies are expected to grow at a 5.1% annual pace this year, up from 3.5% in 2022, the report said. But not including China, growth is expected to slip to 4.9% in 2023 after a rebound from the worst of the pandemic of 5.8% in 2022, it said.Major Asian economies like Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam will see their recoveries slow and meanwhile face risks from weakening global growth, spillover from the war in Ukraine and climate change disasters.Demand for exports from the region has slowed as the Federal Reserve and other central banks have targeted inflation by hiking interest rates, making it more costly to buy on credit or get mortgages.Meanwhile, China's economy has slowed significantly in the longer term, even as it bounces back from the disruptions caused by the pandemic.Friction between the U.S. and China over trade and technology are “the most immediate challenge” for the region, the report said.Sanctions and other restrictions imposed by each side have to a certain extent diverted trade to other countries. While China lost market share in exports to the U.S. in recent years, countries like Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia have gained share. But geopolitics can disrupt trade and limit sharing of knowhow while also preventing other countries from attaining the scale of operations to serve global markets, the report said.Private economists have also cut their forecasts for growth in the region this year, citing the possibility that the tighter monetary policies may bring on recessions in the U.S. or other major economies. Many countries in the region are grappling with onerous debt loads after spending heavily during the pandemic, while households also borrowed heavily.“Once pent-up demand from post-lockdown fades, we think that Asian economies will settle at lower GDP growth and higher inflation than our pre-pandemic forecasts,” Sung Eun Jung of Oxford Economics said in a report.The region has made huge strides in alleviating poverty but progress toward higher incomes and reducing inequality has stalled due to a slowing of reforms and productivity gains, the World Bank report said. But countries need to address longstanding needs for reform such as investing more in education and public health to improve productivity and spur sustainable growth.“Most major economies of East Asia and the Pacific have come through the difficulties of the pandemic but must now navigate a changed global landscape,” World Bank East Asia and Pacific Vice President Manuela V. Ferro said in a statement. “To regain momentum, there is work left to do to boost innovation, productivity, and to set the foundations for a greener recovery.”",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852277,Montenegro vote pits incumbent president against new blood,"PODGORICA, Montenegro (AP) — Voters in small Montenegro go to the polls this weekend to choose their next president in a runoff between pro-Western incumbent Milo Djukanovic and Jakov Milatovic, a newcomer supported by the shaky governing coalition with links to neighboring Serbia.Observers say Milatovic, a politician on the rise, stands a better chance than Djukanovic, who is credited with leading the Balkan nation to independence from Serbia and into NATO but whose long presence in Montenegrin politics has fueled a desire for change.The ballot is being held after none of the candidates won enough support in the first round of voting two weeks ago. Here is a look at the main facts on Montenegro, Sunday's election and the two candidates:MONTENEGRO, IN A NUTSHELLMontenegro is a small nation of some 620,000 people, located in Europe's Balkan peninsula, by the Adriatic Sea. The country became independent after a referendum in 2006 following decades in a union with Serbia, but remains divided over relations with its much larger neighbor.Politically, Montenegro is a member of NATO and now seeking to join the European Union. That effort, however, has been stalled because of political turmoil after a change of government in 2020. This has alarmed the West as Montenegro is considered a key ally in efforts to counter Russian influence and maintain stability in the Balkans.Montenegro boasts stunning natural beauty in both its mountains and the sandy coastline.WHY IS THIS ELECTION IMPORTANT?Although the presidency in Montenegro is a more or less a ceremonial post, the vote is important because it could signal a political reshuffle ahead of early parliamentary election on June 11. Whichever candidate wins is expected to give an important boost to his party's chances in the June vote.Djukanovic has insisted that voters also chose whether Montenegro will advance toward EU integration or will continue to “stumble,” as has been the case in the past 2 1/2 years since his Democratic Party of Socialists was ousted with the help of the Serbian Orthodox Church in Montenegro.Milatovic, who served in the first post-DPS government after three decades, says Djukanovic and his party devastated Montenegro during their rule, allowing crime and corruption to engulf society.WHO ARE THE CANDIDATES?MILO DJUKANOVIC: At the age of 61, Djukanovic is possibly Europe's longest-serving politician who first became prime minister at 29 and has stayed in power for the past 32 years. Djukanovic has been the prime minister and president on multiple occasions, serving practically unchallenged until now.Djukanovic and his DPS kept Montenegro stable while wars raged in the rest of the Balkans during the 1990s. He turned away from Serbia and pushed for independence in 2006, and later defied Slavic ally Russia in 2017 to take his nation into NATO.Nowadays, Djukanovic says his mission is not over because Montenegro is again under threat from neighboring Serbia's expansionist policies and Russia's influence. Djukanovic has accused his opponent Milatovic and the current government of “brutal populism” in leading the country.JAKOV MILATOVIC: Young and successful — the 36-year-old economist earned his education in Britain and the United States — Milatovic has appealed to voters disillusioned with established politicians like Djukanovic. Milatovic already has declared Djukanovic's era over, campaigning on the need for change and promising a better future.Milatovic's Europe Now emerged after the first government that resulted from the 2020 parliamentary elections collapsed. As the economy minister, Milatovic gained popular support by increasing salaries but critics say this was done at the cost of the already depleted health system and not based on real economic improvements.If Milatovic wins his Europe Now movement could find itself in a position to dominate the next government that will be formed after the June 11 vote. Milatovic says he is pro-EU, while opponents point to his close ties to the Serbian Orthodox Church and groups that want the country to revive its historically close relations with Serbia.HOW WILL THE VOTING UNFOLD?Polls open from 0500GMT until 1800GMT. Montenegro has some 540,000 eligible voters and turnout in the country is usually relatively high. First projections of the final tally will be given about an hour after polls close by usually reliable local monitoring agencies. Official results are expected later in the evening or on Monday.",2023/03/31,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852279,"Review: Sandler, Aniston reteam in 'Murder Mystery 2'","You would have a hard time defending the limp plotting, the bland action-adventure set pieces or the Agatha Christie-light whodunit twists of the first “Murder Mystery.” And, yet, it was kind of good.“Murder Mystery,” one of Netflix's most-streamed films, was chock full of exotic settings and mysterious murders. But the only thing that mattered, really, was the banter between Jennifer Aniston and Adam Sandler. Though “Murder Mystery” could be said to epitomize that very modern kind of passive and painless viewing experience on streaming platforms, their married couple was a throwback to a long-ago movie era. Audrey and Nick Spitz, a pair of working-class New Yorkers turned semi-amateur detectives, might as well be Nick and Nora Charles, the 1930s cocktail-swilling crime solvers.“Murder Mystery” and its new sequel don't have anywhere near the sparkle of the “The Thin Man” movies, with William Powell, Myrna Loy and their wire fox terrier Asta. But like those films, everything in “Murder Mystery"" and “Murder Mystery 2” is secondary, and distantly so, to the comic and sweet rapport between the Spitzes, a bickering but lovingly connected married couple. Like its predecessor, “Murder Mystery 2” is built on old-fashioned star power and the interplay between Sandler and Aniston. They’re good company to be in, and sometimes that’s enough.Whether “Murder Mystery 2” meets that somewhat low bar will probably depend on just how casually you're watching it. For many, it may be enough to say that “Murder Mystery 2,"" which debuts Friday on Netflix, fits the bill as amiable background noise.And this one, in which Jeremy Garelick (writer of “The Hangover”) takes over directing with James Vanderbilt returning to write the screenplay, starts out like a new season to a TV series, with a narrated recap of what the Spitzes have been up to since the last film. After their luck solving their first case, they've made themselves full-time private eyes. The clients aren't lining up, though, so it's welcome news when a friend from the first film, the Maharajah (Adeel Akhtar), calls up to invite them to his wedding and fly them out to his private island and then to Paris.For those who have accused Sandler of using movies as an excuse to hang out with friends in beautiful locales, the “Murder Mystery” movies won't disappoint. This time, the action has been turned up a notch, especially once the Maharajah is kidnapped and an MI6 hostage negotiator (Mark Strong) shows up. Strong's potent presence lends some credibility to the mayhem, mostly in Paris, but he also gives Sandler and Aniston a straight man to bounce their jokes off of. Some of the gags are pretty dusty, even by “Thin Man” standards, including one Sandler line comparing marriage to hostage negotiations and a dance scene at an Indian wedding that's unlikely to draw any comparisons to “RRR.”All of this may lend some scale to “Murder Mystery 2” but it's no help to the comedy. Despite that, good comic chemistry can be hard to come by, and Aniston — who's been wonderful in these films — and Sandler keep these films more entertaining than they should be.Especially in recent years — a chilly period for big-screen comedies — the movies have struggled to figure out what do with bright, funny women like Aniston despite their abundant talent. Even in these decent-at-best comedies, her natural sense of timing is sharp and lively, and she and Sandler make a charming, easy-flowing duo. All they really need, to borrow a trick from Nick and Nora, is a dog.""Murder Mystery 2,” a Netflix release, is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for violence, bloody images, strong language, suggestive material and smoking. Running time: 91 minutes. Two stars out of four.___Follow AP Film Writer Jake Coyle on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/jakecoyleAP",2023/03/31,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852293,US Army command responsible for Taiwan has 'gigantic problem' with logistics,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The U.S. Army has a “gigantic problem” with logistics in the Indo-Pacific region, according to General James Rainey, who heads the agency responsible for modernizing the country’s military.The United States Indo-Pacific Command (INDO-PACOM) is responsible for military operations in the Indo-Pacific region, which includes Taiwan. U.S. Army officials told Defence News on March 28 that they are working to increase capabilities in the region to allow for large scale deployment of troops and equipment.To achieve this, Rainey said the army is buying new equipment, working with domestic industry, improving communications, and increasing the “lethality and survivability” of deployments.Lieutenant General Christopher Mohan heads the department responsible for organizing equipment for the army, and said that the force’s main focus is the Indo-Pacific region. “That is probably our hardest fight to sustain just based upon the sheer geographical distances and the fact that there’s so much water out there,” he said.Mohan said that this does not mean the army will neglect Europe or scale back what it is doing in Ukraine, but said “increasingly you’ll see budget decisions being made that are starting to steer us towards our pacing threat, and that’s no surprise.”The term “pacing threat” was described by the U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin as recognition that ""China is the only country that can pose a systemic challenge to the United States in the sense of challenging us, economically, technologically, politically and militarily."" U.S. Under Secretary for Defense Colin Kahl said that this does not mean conflict with China is inevitable, but that it does mean the U.S. will have a more “competitive, and at times… adversarial” relationship with Beijing.The U.S. Army will reportedly begin war games in the region within weeks, and Mohan said that the army will increase the number of army bases in the region to challenge adversaries. The U.S. Department of Defense listed China as the main threat to U.S. security and interests in 2022.In February the Philippines agreed to allow the U.S. to station troops and equipment in nine military bases throughout the country, marking the largest U.S. presence in Southeast Asia for 30 years.",2023/03/31,2355,World

The incidents occurred within 1 kilometer of each other, and both cattle died.The train that hit a cow on Thursday was a local train numbered 4508 travelling from Yuli, Hualien to Taitung.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852316,Spain: Easter procession events a 'yearlong' operation,"ELCHE, Spain (AP) — Spain is getting ready for one of its most revered holiday periods of the year: Easter Week, which means thousands of colorful and noisy religious street processions that draw multitudes onto the streets to watch.The central pieces of the processions are the richly decorated gigantic floats bearing sculptures of Jesus or the Virgin and often weighing up to a ton or more.The ceremonies see brotherhoods of “nazarenos,” or penitents, with tall conical hats, monkish robes and hoods carrying or escorting the magnificent carriages through ancient streets of cities and towns nationwide.While the processions take place over just a handful of days, preparations are a year-round affair and involve a wide range of small, sometimes family-run businesses. The artisans are responsible for producing all the regalia, from conical hats and huge candles to palm leaf bouquets. There are also workshops in charge of the conservation of religious sculptures, their dresses and adorning cloths.“It’s yearlong preparation,” says Paqui Serrano, an artisan palm leaf bouquet-maker in Elche, southeast Spain, the heart of Spain’s palm tree agriculture.Tying up the leaves on the palm trees starts in January. The process keeps the leaves a golden white instead of turning green.Once harvested, they are woven into delicate floral decorations and set on pedestals that are carried during the processions.Elche traditionally sends such bouquets to public figures. This year, the recipients included Pope Francis and Spain's Queen Letizia.Serrano's family workshop stretches back over more than four generations and is one of five family-based palm leaf outfits in the city.She said new techniques allowing for the leaves to be conserved gives them more time to design more intricate braids. The work, while often painstaking, can be relaxing, she said..“As you can see, the machines and tools are our hands, needles and scissors, and it can be stressful,” Serrano explained. ""But when you are working at what you like, well, it can almost serve as a therapy because it relaxes you a lot.”“Out of respect for the palm tree,” each tree tree is allowed to rest for between three to five years before its leaves are used again, she said.Fernando Chicharro Méndez, head of the team float bearers in Madrid’s Jesus of the Great Power and Macarena Brotherhood, has carried floats for 25 years. He says the task of carrying the floats has varied little in the brotherhood’s 83 years of existence.Chicharro says he and his son, another float bearer, and family are constantly occupied with the processions and their preparations.We live it daily,” he said. “In my family, all are brotherhood members and experience it with great faith.”Chicharro's float is carried by 35 bearers, with brothers on standby to relieve them along the procession route. Their practice sessions frequently pique the interest of tourists and Spaniards alike as they wind their way through the streets in the weeks before Easter.Easter this year begins with Palm Sunday on April 2. A sacred holiday for Spaniards, it generally sees millions taking trips out of town, often just to witness the processions.____Giles contributed from Madrid.____Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

The decision by the Turkish parliament followed Hungary's ratification of Finland's bid earlier in the week.The addition of Finland, which shares a 1,340 kilometer (832 miles) border with Russia, will more than double the size of NATO’s border with Russia.However, a few more steps and procedures are required before the northern European nation becomes the 31st full NATO member:ACCEPTANCE LETTERSTurkey and Hungary dispatch acceptance letters to the United States which is the depositary, or safekeeper, of NATO under the alliance's 1949 founding treaty. The letters will be filed in the archives of the U.S. State Department, which will notify NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg that the conditions for inviting Finland to become a member were met.INVITATIONNATO sends a letter signed by Stoltenberg inviting Finland to join the military alliance.SIGNATURESFinland sends its own acceptance document, signed by Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto, to the U.S. State Department. Finnish President Sauli Niinistö authorized Haavisto to sign the document. Either the Finnish Embassy in Washington or a Finnish government official will deliver the document.FULL MEMBERSHIPOnce Finland's membership acceptance document reaches the State Department in Washington, the country officially becomes a NATO member.FINLAND-SWEDENFinland and neighboring Sweden jointly applied for NATO membership in May 2022. The countries, which have close cultural, economic and political ties, planned to enter the alliance simultaneously.Sweden’s bid, however, has stalled due to opposition from Turkey, whose president has said his country wouldn’t ratify membership before disputes between Ankara and Stockholm were resolved. The Turkish government has accused Sweden of being too soft on groups that it deems to be terror organizations.Hungary's parliament also has yet to ratify Sweden's accession to NATO, and it remains unclear when it will do so.",2023/03/31,,World

The military revealed on Friday that the U.S. will ship 400 Javelin missiles to Taiwan in 2023 and 2024, and 42 Javelin launchers were delivered to the army at the end of last year, per CNA.
U.S. President Donald Trump greenlit the sale of the Javelin missiles and TOW 2B RF missiles to Taiwan in 2019, CNA cited Su as saying. The Javelin missile is a ‘fire-and-forget’ weapon that can pierce armor 800 mm thick and autonomously guide itself to the target, he said.
Su added that the missile can explode from above a target, enabling greater lethality. The missile is most effective in preventing an amphibious landing, he said.










The military’s choice of weapons reveals its “innovative thinking,” the director said. He pointed out that the army is considering using a large number of anti-armor missiles as near-shore weapons to create a strategic advantage.
A battalion-sized landing force needs about 25 to 30 landing craft to seize a beach, Su said. These uncovered landing craft and lightly armored amphibious vehicles will just be targets for the Javelin missile.
Additionally, the new 2B TOW missile has wireless guidance technology, which allows it to be fired near bodies of water, Su said. Older TOW missile variants still guided by wires often failed to hit their targets, especially during previous Han Kuang exercises, he said.TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwan’s new javelin missiles will boost asymmetric warfare capabilities, Institute for National Defense and Security Research Director Su Tzu-yun (蘇紫雲) said on Friday (March 31).The military revealed on Friday that the U.S. will ship 400 Javelin missiles to Taiwan in 2023 and 2024, and 42 Javelin launchers were delivered to the army at the end of last year, per CNA.U.S. President Donald Trump greenlit the sale of the Javelin missiles and TOW 2B RF missiles to Taiwan in 2019, CNA cited Su as saying.

As to when the payments will be transmitted, MODA stated that the time it will take for each financial institution may vary due to the difference in the number of accounts recorded by each institution.It stated that in general, payments should commence on April 6. However, MODA pointed out that because many financial institutions have sped up the process of handling the tax rebates, some institutions may release them ahead of schedule.The Digital ministry said a small number of people whose accounts belong to a particular bank had received the credit Friday (March 31) but added ""this is a special situation with a particular bank, most financial institutions are consistent (in releasing the funds) on April 6.""The ministry stated that people can check the status of their registration on the website by clicking on the ""Query registration results"" (查詢登記結果) on the left side of the NT$6,000 Universal Cash Payment website.Eligible people who did not register online can begin receiving the funds at ATMS on April 10.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852359,"Portable Power Station Market Trends, Industry Expansion Strategies and Global Analysis by Forecast to 2031","The global portable power station market is on the rise, projected to reach USD 554.4 million by 2028. According to a recent study by strategic consulting and market research firm, Report Ocean, the market reached USD 359.4 million in 2021, and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.4% during the forecast period of 2022-2028.

China happens to be the biggest country in the EVs sector in terms of sales, with an estimated 4.5 million electric cars running on the roads in 2020. As against this, Europe registered the highest annual increase by registering 3.2 million in sales in just a year. Since electric vehicles are powered by electricity, they may run out of power in the middle of nowhere, which offers great opportunities to the global portable power station market. However, the number of EV charging stations is stagnant, leaving consumers with no choice but to look for alternatives, such as portable power stations of higher capacities, which has become a driving factor for the growth of the global portable power station market.Request To Download Sample of This Strategic Report:- https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=MR363Online segment occupied the largest market share in the sales channel categoryThere are two main sales channels for the global portable power station market online and offline.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852364,China calls US debt trap accusation 'irresponsible',"BEIJING/ WASHINGTON, March 30 (Reuters) - China on Thursday called remarks by U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen ""irresponsible"" and ""unreasonable"" after Yellen said Beijing's lending activities leave developing countries ""trapped in debt.""Yellen on Wednesday said she was concerned by some of China's activities globally, particularly its lending to developing countries. She told U.S. lawmakers in a hearing that Washington was working hard to counter China's influence in international institutions and in lending to developing nations.China has lent hundreds of billions of dollars to build infrastructure in developing countries, but lending has tailed off since 2016 as many projects have failed to pay the expected financial dividends.""I am very, very concerned about some of the activities that China engages in globally, engaging in countries in ways that leave them trapped in debt and don't promote economic development,"" Yellen said on Wednesday.In response, the Chinese government on Thursday said the debt problems of the world were made worse by the United States due to what Beijing called an ""unprecedented rate"" of interest rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve.""We do not accept unreasonable accusations from the United States,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said in a news briefing on Thursday.""The United States should take practical actions to help developing countries, instead of pointing fingers at other countries and making irresponsible remarks,"" Mao added.China says it has always followed international rules and carried out investment and financing cooperation with developing countries with openness and transparency.China spent $240 billion bailing out 22 developing countries between 2008 and 2021, with the amount soaring in recent years as more have struggled to repay loans spent building ""Belt and Road"" infrastructure, a recently published study showed.China is negotiating debt restructurings with countries including Zambia, Ghana and Sri Lanka and has been criticised for holding up the processes. In response, it has called on the World Bank and International Monetary Fund to also offer debt relief.",2023/03/31,357,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852376,U.S. stresses need for 'Cold War'-era crisis mechanisms with China,"WASHINGTON, March 30 (Reuters) - Efforts to build a floor under U.S.-China relations have yet to be successful and coming months will determine if it is possible to reestablish constructive diplomacy with Beijing, a top White House official said on Thursday, stressing the need for ""Cold War""-era hotlines and other crisis mechanisms.Speaking at a time of heightened tensions with China over a U.S. stopover by Taiwan's president, U.S. Indo-Pacific coordinator Kurt Campbell said Washington had made clear to Beijing it was ready to have another call between President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping.""We're prepared and, from our perspective, we want to keep lines of communication open and it is our intention to keep those lines open,"" he said at an event hosted by the Center for a New American Security (CNAS) think tank.Biden said last month after a U.S. fighter jet shot down a suspected Chinese spy balloon that he planned to speak to Xi about the episode and clear the air, but this has yet to happen and tensions have only risen since.Campbell said the Chinese had been ""reluctant to engage in discussions around confidence-building or crisis communications, or hotlines"" and it would be a ""responsible step"" to have such mechanisms, given that Chinese and U.S. military forces operated in proximity to each other.""We built those during the Cold War. We think that they're appropriate now,"" he added.Campbell said the U.S. was in the early stages of a new phase of competitive relations with China.""There's also a recognition that in many respects our efforts to build a foundation, a floor under the relationship and guardrails, have yet to be successful,"" he said, referring to U.S. priorities when Biden and Xi last spoke at a meeting in Bali in November.""I think you will see in the coming months whether it's going to be possible to reestablish effective, predictable, constructive diplomacy between the United States and China.”Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen arrived in New York on Wednesday on her way to Central America. On her way back to Taipei next week, she will stop in Los Angeles, where she is expected to meet U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Kevin McCarthy, an interaction China has warned could lead to a ""serious confrontation"" in U.S.-China relations.The visit comes at a time when U.S. relations with China are at what some analysts see as their worst level since Washington normalized ties with Beijing in 1979 and switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei.Campbell said the United States was stepping up its focus on the Indo-Pacific in spite of the war in Ukraine and this would been seen in its budgets, engagements, aid and assistance.He pointed to India, which is due to take part in another summit of the so-called Quad countries in Australia expected in May, and said he believed its relationship with the United States was the most important of the 21st century.""I believe we are destined to work more closely together,” he said, adding that Washington wanted to see more Indian students in American universities and more Americans in Indian colleges.Campbell said the United States has an ""ambitious agenda"" for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum summit it hosts in November, and Biden would roll out steps to address U.S. determination to play not just a security, diplomatic and political role in the region, ""but a vibrant economic and commercial role as well.""",2023/03/31,211,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852382,"Tokyo inflation cools for second month, but exceeds BOJ target","TOKYO, March 31 (Reuters) - Core consumer inflation in Japan's capital Tokyo slowed in March for a second month but remained well above the central bank's 2% target, data showed on Friday, highlighting broadening price pressures in the world's third-largest economy.
A separate index stripping away energy prices rose at the fastest year-on-year pace since 1990, a sign the effect of government subsidies to curb utility bills did little to stem the rising cost of living for households.
The data underscores the challenge incoming Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda faces in assessing whether recent cost-driven inflation will shift to one backed by solid demand and wage growth as uncertainties cloud Japan's fragile economy.
While factory output rebounded in February, some analysts warn of mounting downside risks as slumping global demand for technology goods hits the country's exports.
""With export volumes on track to record the sharpest contraction since the initial outbreak of the pandemic, we still consider it more likely than not that GDP will have contracted in the first quarter and we think it will do again in Q2,"" said Marcel Thieliant, head of Asia-Pacific at Capital Economics.
Core consumer prices in Tokyo, a leading indicator of nationwide trends, rose 3.2% in March from a year earlier, compared with a median market forecast for a 3.1% gain.
The pace of increase slowed from a 3.3% gain in February and a nearly 42-year high of 4.3% hit in January, due largely to the effect of government subsidies to curb utility bills.
An index for Tokyo stripping away fresh food and energy prices, which is closely watched by the BOJ as a gauge of demand-side price pressures, was 3.4% higher in March than a year earlier and faster than a 3.1% rise in February.
""Companies aren't done hiking prices to pass on higher costs. Inflation will probably stay elevated at least during the first half of this year,"" said Yoshiki Shike, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
The prices of more than 5,100 food items are set to rise in April, Teikoku Databank said in a report on Friday, adding that grocery price hikes would likely persist until around October.
For now, households appear to be weathering the pain. Data released on Friday showed retail sales rose 6.6% in February from a year earlier, beating market forecasts for a 5.8% gain, on solid sales at car dealers and department stores.
Separately, factory output rose 4.5% in February from January, better than a forecast 2.7% gain and rebounding from a revised 5.3% drop in January, on easing supply bottlenecks for carmakers.
While manufacturers surveyed by the government expect to increase output in coming months, some analysts warned of risks.
""There's a bigger risk of a downgrade in manufacturers' output plans due to weaknesses in the information-technology (IT) sector. Global demand is shifting away from goods towards services, which is bad news for Japan's export-reliant economy,"" Shinke of Dai-ichi Life Research said.
Japan's economy is finally recovering from the scars of the COVID-19 pandemic after a delay, though risks of a global slowdown and rising food prices hang over the outlook for exports and consumption.
With inflation already exceeding its target, markets are rife with speculation the BOJ could tweak or end yield curve control (YCC) when Ueda succeeds incumbent Haruhiko Kuroda whose second, five-year term ends in April.
YCC aims to control the shape of the yield curve to suppress short- to medium-term rates without depressing super-long yields too much.
""Given uncertainty over the global economic outlook, the BOJ may sustain ultra-loose policy. But there's a chance it will change the means of keeping monetary policy loose,"" such as by tweaking YCC, said Takumi Tsunoda, senior economist at Shinkin Central Bank Research Institute.TOKYO, March 31 (Reuters) - Core consumer inflation in Japan's capital Tokyo slowed in March for a second month but remained well above the central bank's 2% target, data showed on Friday, highlighting broadening price pressures in the world's third-largest economy.A separate index stripping away energy prices rose at the fastest year-on-year pace since 1990, a sign the effect of government subsidies to curb utility bills did little to stem the rising cost of living for households.The data underscores the challenge incoming Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda faces in assessing whether recent cost-driven inflation will shift to one backed by solid demand and wage growth as uncertainties cloud Japan's fragile economy.While factory output rebounded in February, some analysts warn of mounting downside risks as slumping global demand for technology goods hits the country's exports.""With export volumes on track to record the sharpest contraction since the initial outbreak of the pandemic, we still consider it more likely than not that GDP will have contracted in the first quarter and we think it will do again in Q2,"" said Marcel Thieliant, head of Asia-Pacific at Capital Economics.Core consumer prices in Tokyo, a leading indicator of nationwide trends, rose 3.2% in March from a year earlier, compared with a median market forecast for a 3.1% gain.The pace of increase slowed from a 3.3% gain in February and a nearly 42-year high of 4.3% hit in January, due largely to the effect of government subsidies to curb utility bills.An index for Tokyo stripping away fresh food and energy prices, which is closely watched by the BOJ as a gauge of demand-side price pressures, was 3.4% higher in March than a year earlier and faster than a 3.1% rise in February.""Companies aren't done hiking prices to pass on higher costs.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852384,Oscar Pistorius stays in prison after his parole is denied,"PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) — Former Olympic runner Oscar Pistorius was denied parole Friday and will have to stay in prison for at least another year and four months after it was decided that he had not served the “minimum detention period” required to be released following his murder conviction for killing girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp 10 years ago.The parole board ruled that Pistorius would only be able to apply again in August 2024, South Africa's Department of Corrections said in a short, two-paragraph statement. It was released soon after a parole hearing at the Atteridgeville Correctional Centre prison where Pistorius is being held.The board cited a new clarification on Pistorius' sentence that was issued by South Africa's Supreme Court of Appeal just three days before the hearing, according to the statement. Still, legal experts criticized authorities' decision to go ahead with the hearing when Pistorius was not eligible.Reeva Steenkamp's parents, Barry and June, are “relieved” with the decision to keep Pistorius in prison but are not celebrating it, their lawyer told The Associated Press.“They can’t celebrate because there are no winners in this situation. They lost a daughter and South Africa lost a hero,” lawyer Tania Koen said, referring to the dramatic fall from grace of Pistorius, once a world-famous and highly-admired athlete.The decision and reasoning to deny parole was a surprise but there has been legal wrangling over when Pistorius should be eligible for parole because of the series of appeals in his case. He was initially convicted of culpable homicide, a charge comparable to manslaughter, in 2014 but the case went through a number of appeals before Pistorius was finally sentenced to 13 years and five months in prison for murder in 2017.Serious offenders must serve at least half their sentence to be eligible for parole in South Africa. Pistorius' lawyers had previously gone to court to argue that he was eligible because he had served the required portion if they also counted periods served in jail from late 2014 following his culpable homicide conviction.The lawyer handling Pistorius’ parole application did not immediately return phone calls seeking comment.June Steenkamp attended Pistorius' hearing inside the prison complex to oppose his parole. The parents have said they still do not believe Pistorius' account of their daughter's killing and wanted him to stay in jail.Pistorius, who is now 36, has always claimed he killed Steenkamp, a 29-year-old model and law student, in the pre-dawn hours of Valentine's Day 2013 after mistaking her for a dangerous intruder in his home. He shot four times with his licensed 9 mm pistol through a closed toilet cubicle door in his bathroom, where Steenkamp was, hitting her multiple times. Pistorius claimed he didn’t realize his girlfriend had got out of bed and gone to the bathroom.The Steenkamps say they still think he is lying and killed her intentionally after a late-night argument.Lawyer Koen had struck a more critical tone when addressing reporters outside the prison before the hearing, saying the Steenkamps believed Pistorius could not be considered to be rehabilitated “unless he comes clean"" over the killing.“He’s the killer of their daughter. For them, it’s a life sentence,” Koen said before the hearing.June Steenkamp had sat grim-faced in the back seat of a car nearby while Koen spoke to reporters outside the prison gates ahead of the hearing. June Steenkamp and Koen were then driven into the prison in a Department of Corrections vehicle. June Steenkamp made her submission to the parole board in a separate room to Pistorius and did not come face-to-face with her daughter's killer, Koen said.Barry Steenkamp did not travel for the hearing because of poor health but a family friend read out a statement to the parole board on his behalf, the parents' lawyer said.Pistorius was once hailed as an inspirational figure for overcoming the adversity of his disability, before his murder trial and sensational downfall captivated the world.Pistorius’s lower legs were amputated when he was a baby because of a congenital condition and he walks with prosthetics. He went on to become a double-amputee runner and multiple Paralympic champion who made history by competing against able-bodied athletes at the 2012 London Olympics, running on specially designed carbon-fiber blades.Pistorius' conviction eventually led to him being sent to the Kgosi Mampuru II maximum security prison, one of South Africa’s most notorious. He was moved to the Atteridgeville prison in 2016 because that facility is better suited to disabled prisoners.There have only been glimpses of his life in prison, with reports claiming he had at one point grown a beard, gained weight and taken up smoking and was unrecognizable from the elite athlete he once was.He has spent much of his time working in an area of the prison grounds where vegetables are grown, sometimes driving a tractor, and has reportedly been running bible classes for other inmates.Pistorius' father, Henke Pistorius, told the Pretoria News newspaper before the hearing that his family hoped he would be home soon.“Deep down, we believe he will be home soon,” Henke Pistorius said, “but until the parole board has spoken the word, I don’t want to get my hopes up.”___Imray reported from Cape Town, South Africa.",2023/04/01,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852386,China factory activity grows at slower pace in March,"BEIJING (AP) — China’s factory activity grew at a slower pace in March but was stronger than expected following the end of anti-virus restrictions, a survey showed Friday.The monthly purchasing managers’ index issued by the China Federation of Logistics & Purchasing and the national statistics agency declined to 51.9 from February’s 52.6 on a 100-point scale. Numbers above 50 show activity increasing.Sub-measures of production and new orders in the PMI grew at a slower pace. Employment contracted.Business activity is recovering after the ruling Communist Party ended stringent anti-virus restrictions in early December. That followed a slump in activity that dragged last year’s economic growth to 3%, its second-lowest level since at least the 1970s.“The economy continues to maintain a recovery trend, but the pace has slowed slightly,” the Federation said in a statement.Exporters are under pressure from weak U.S. and European demand after the Federal Reserve and other central banks raised interest rates to cool inflation.Construction has revived following the easing of government controls imposed on the real estate industry to rein in the rise of debt the ruling Communist Party worries is dangerously high.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852387,"Vatican: Pope OK to leave hospital, has pizza, baptizes baby","ROME (AP) — Pope Francis has been cleared by doctors for discharge on Saturday from the Rome hospital where he was treated for bronchitis, the Vatican said, adding that the pontiff had pizza one evening with medical staff and baptized a baby in the pediatrics ward.Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni, in one of several updates on Friday, also said that Francis will be in St. Peter's Square for Palm Sunday Mass at the start of Holy Week, although he didn't say if the pontiff would deliver the homily during the particularly lengthy service.“The medical team that is following His Holiness Pope Francis, after evaluating the outcome of tests carried out today and the favorable clinical recovery, has confirmed discharge” on Saturday, Bruni said in a written statement Friday night.Francis, 86, was hospitalized on Wednesday at Gemelli Polyclinic, where doctors said the pontiff was receiving antibiotics intravenously to treat his bronchitis.Calling the pontiff's medical recovery “normal,” Bruni said earlier in the day that on Thursday evening, ""Pope Francis had dinner, eating a pizza, together with all those who are assisting him in these days of the hospital stay,” including doctors, nurses, assistants and Vatican security personnel.Given the pope's return to the Vatican hotel where he lives, the spokesman said, was expected to be present in the square for Palm Sunday Mass, which formally begins Holy Week that culminates with Easter Mass in the square on April 9.Medical personnel decided to hospitalize him on Wednesday after he returned to his Vatican residence following his customary weekly public audience in St. Peter’s Square. The Vatican reported he had experienced difficulty breathing in the previous days.The Vatican on Thursday said that antibiotic treatment for bronchitis had resulted in a “marked” improvement in his health.In a video released by the Vatican, Francis was seen baptizing a hospitalized baby who is a few weeks old.After the mother tells Francis the boy's name, Miguel Angel, the pope uses a metal hospital tray usually employed to hold syringes to pour water over the sleeping baby's head, then tries to comfort the infant, who wakes up, wailing and seeming to try to swat away the pope's hand.Francis then asked the mother to dry her son's wet forehead. He then told her: ”When you go to your parish, say that the pope baptized him.""Francis was smiling and looked chipper as he visited children being treated at Gemelli for cancer and gave out large, wrapped chocolate Easter eggs.Earlier in the day, Francis sent a tweet on Friday possibly inspired by his current health challenge.“When experienced with faith, the trials and difficulties of life serve to purify our hearts, making them humbler and thus more and more open to God,” Francis wrote. The tweet carried a hashtag for Lent, the period of the liturgical year stressing penitence and sacrifice in the run-up to the joyous Church celebration of Easter, which marks the Christian belief that Jesus rose from the dead after his crucifixion.The Vatican seemed keen to quickly dispel any worries about the pope's physical fitness to carry on fully with his duties. Nearly immediately after the announcement of a discharge date for Francis, the Vatican announced that the pope would meet the prime minister of Bosnia-Herzegovina on Monday in a private audience at the Apostolic Palace.Palm Sunday Mass usually draws tens of thousands of faithful, including many pilgrims from abroad, flocking to Rome for Holy Week.Francis had already largely stopped celebrating Mass at major Catholic Church holy days because of a chronic knee problem, but had continued to preside at the ceremonies and deliver homilies.The Holy Week appointments include a stamina-taxing late night Way of the Cross procession marked by prayers on Good Friday at the Colosseum in Rome and Easter Mass on April 9, which is traditionally followed by a long papal speech delivered from the central balcony of St. Peter's Basilica.During Wednesday's hour-long public audience, Francis at times appeared visibly in pain when he moved about and was helped by aides.In July 2021, Francis underwent surgery at Gemelli Polyclinic after suffering from a narrowing of his colon. As a young man in Argentina, Francis had part of a lung removed.",2023/04/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852388,Members of exiled Chinese church detained in Thailand,"BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) — More than 60 self-exiled members of a Chinese Christian church who were detained in Thailand paid fines for overstaying their visas but remained in police custody Saturday uncertain about their legal status amid fears they would be deported against their will to their home country, where they face possible persecution.The 63 members of the Shenzhen Holy Reformed Church were taken to court Friday in the resort city of Pattaya after being detained a day earlier by Thai immigration authorities. The 32 members of the group considered to be adults were charged with overstaying their visas, said Col. Tawee Kutthalaeng, chief of the Pattaya-area Nong Prue police station. Two American citizens who were with the group and briefly held had not been placed under arrest, he said.After being fined, the church members had expected to be released to be able to return to where they had been staying in the area, said Deana Brown, one of two American supporters who accompanied them. Brown said she has been working to resettle the church members in Tyler, Texas, where her organization is based.However, they were put on two buses which first took them to the Pattaya office of the immigration police and then drove them to Bangkok for what a police officer told The Associated Press was normal processing of their case.The drive under police escort from Pattaya to Bangkok, which would normally take about two hours, instead took closer to five because the passengers forced the buses to stop en route and disembarked by the roadside, saying they feared they were being driven to Bangkok's international airport to be repatriated.There were grounds for their skepticism. In 2015, Thailand sent 109 members of the Muslim Uyghur minority back to China against their will despite fears they would face official persecution and possible torture. The U.N. refugee agency at the time called Thailand’s action “a flagrant violation of international law,” and the United States also condemned the deportations.Only after receiving reassurances by phone did the Chinese church members continue their journey, arriving early Saturday morning at a police facility known as the Police Club in northern Bangkok that has space for large numbers of detainees. The main Immigration Detention Center in the middle of Bangkok, where some detainees have been stuck for years, is notoriously overcrowded.Members of the Shenzhen Holy Reformed Church, also called the Mayflower Church, came to Thailand in 2022 seeking asylum. They are trying to get to the U.S., but the current status of their applications is not clear. Most members of the church are young, married, middle-class couples, with their children making up about half the group.They fled China in 2019 alleging that they were being persecuted by government security forces, initially settling on South Korea’s Jeju Island. They left South Korea for Thailand after meetings with local and U.S. officials made it clear that prospects for refuge there were dim.Human Rights Watch issued a statement Saturday appealing to the Thai government not to repatriate the group.“Thai authorities need to recognize the grave dangers facing Christians back in China and under no circumstances force them to return,” said Elaine Pearson, the New York-based organization's Asia director.""If Thailand determines that the 63 Christian Chinese cannot stay, then they should be permitted to seek protection in another country,” Pearson said. “Rights-respecting governments should urgently step up to express their willingness to receive these asylum seekers at risk.”Brown, CEO of the Texas-based Freedom Seekers International, an organization whose mission statement says it seeks to rescue “the most severely persecuted Christians in hostile and restrictive countries,” said that when the group looked into renewing their visas, they were told of a new requirement that any Chinese citizen renewing a visa in Thailand must report to the Chinese Embassy first. Their visas expired several months ago.“When they told us that, we knew that nobody could get their visas,” Brown said. “There was no way, because as soon as they walk into the Chinese Embassy they’re gone, we would not see them again. They’ve been hiding out since then.”The press section at the Chinese Embassy in Bangkok did not answer its telephone and the embassy did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.The U.S. Embassy said it had no immediate comment on the case.Upon their 2022 arrival in Thailand, church members told reporters that they had been stalked, harassed and received threatening calls and messages even while they were in South Korea. They said relatives in China had been summoned, interrogated and intimidated.At that time, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said the matter was “not a diplomatic question” and declined to comment further.In China, Christians are legally allowed to worship only in churches affiliated with Communist Party-controlled religious groups, but for decades the authorities largely tolerated independent, unregistered “house churches.” They have tens of millions of worshippers, possibly outnumbering those in the official groups.In recent years, however, house churches have come under heavy pressure, with many prominent ones shut down. Unlike previous crackdowns, such as Beijing’s ban on Falun Gong, a spiritual movement it labels a cult, the authorities have also targeted some believers not explicitly opposed to the Chinese state.China is one of 15 nations that the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom in its annual report last year recommended be designated as “countries of particular concern” for repression of religious groups.It said the ruling Chinese Communist Party’s policies require religious groups to support its rule and its political objectives, including by altering their religious teachings to conform to the party’s ideology and policy. “Both registered and unregistered religious groups and individuals who run afoul of the CCP face harassment, detention, arrest, imprisonment, and other abuses,” the commission said.___Rising reported from Bangkok.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852389,"Charles III commorates WWII dead, child refugees in Hamburg","BERLIN (AP) — King Charles III commemorated the more than 30,000 people, mostly German civilians, who were killed in the Allied bombing of Hamburg almost 80 years ago as he visited the northern city Friday on the last leg of his first foreign trip since becoming monarch.The attack in July 1943 carried out by British and American planes using incendiary bombs was a response to Nazi Germany's deadly aerial raids on Britain. It resulted in a firestorm which destroyed large parts of the city and remains a painful memory in the Hanseatic port's proud history.Charles laid a wreath at the ruined church of St. Nikolai, now a memorial site, and listened to Hamburg's Bishop Kirsten Fehrs read the Coventry Litany of Reconciliation, written to commemorate the destruction of the English city of Coventry by German bombers in 1940.Earlier, Charles and Camilla, the queen consort, visited a memorial to the Kindertransporte, or children’s transports, that saw more than 10,000 Jewish children receive refuge from Nazi Germany in the U.K. in 1938.The royal couple were accompanied to Hamburg by German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, making the two-hour journey from Berlin by high-speed train.The couple landed in the German capital on Wednesday, where Steinmeier greeted them at the Brandenburg Gate with full military honors and later hosted a banquet in their honor.On Thursday, Charles became the first monarch to address the German parliament, telling assembled lawmakers that ""together we must strive for the security, prosperity and well-being that our people deserve.” He then met with Ukrainian refugees and a German-British military unit before visiting an organic farm where he tried his hand at making cheese.Charles' trip is part of a carefully calibrated effort by the U.K. government to mend frayed ties with its continental partners after Brexit.Charles originally planned to visit France first, but anti-government protests in the country led both governments to postpone that part of his trip. The new itinerary put the focus on Germany, where Charles has family roots and the royals have long been the subject of fascination.Despite persistent drizzle, well-wishers waited patiently to greet Charles and Camilla at their stops in Hamburg, a city that sees itself as having a particularly close connection to Britain due to its long seafaring and trading ties.A boat trip and a farewell reception involving musical performances, including by a Beatles cover band and a sea shanty group, will round off the king's visit.",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852390,Death scene in burned ferry moves Filipino rescuers to tears,"MANILA, Philippines (AP) — A Philippine coast guard commander said Friday that the tragic scenes of death his team saw aboard a gutted ferry, including bodies of adults clutching children, had moved them to tears and sparked fears other passengers could be found dead in the still-smoldering ship.At least 29 of more than 250 people onboard the M/V Lady Mary Joy 3 were killed in the blaze that raged through the ferry Wednesday while it was on an overnight trip from the southern Zamboanga city to Jolo town in Sulu province. At least seven passengers, including two army soldiers, remained missing in the country's deadliest sea disaster this year, the coast guard said.Basilan Governor Jim Hataman initially reported 31 deaths Thursday but later reduced the toll to 29 after search and rescue groups crossed-checked their figures.All 35 crew members survived, including the captain, who issued an abandon-ship order when the fire hit close to midnight and then ran the ferry aground on an island off Basilan province to give remaining passengers a better chance to survive, coast guard officials said.Many passengers jumped into the sea in panic without life jackets and were saved by rescuers but at least 11 drowned. When a team of coast guard personnel, including Bureau of Fire officers, boarded the burned ferry on Baluk-baluk island's coast, they discovered the bodies of 18 passengers scattered on the uppermost open-air economy deck and another floor below, coast guard Commander Chadley Salahuddin said.The passengers, including an adult clutching a child by the railing, could have easily jumped into the sea and survived like many others but failed to do so for unclear reasons. Two passengers, apparently siblings who were among the missing, were found holding each other in a bathroom, he said.“When I first saw that scene, I was moved to tears with some of my men,” Salahuddin told The Associated Press by telephone. “It was a short journey. Why did so many have to die?”“What if my mother or my other loved ones were the ones who were trapped here? They were just a step away from the open sides but why did they not jump off like the others?” Salahuddin asked.The passengers, some of whom were burned beyond recognition, could have been overcome by smoke and passed out or could have been immobilized injuries. Some survivors said they heard a series of firecracker-like blasts during the fire but Salahuddin said all of those details could only be confirmed by investigators.He feared more bodies could be found in the lower enclosed decks, which remained dangerously hot and could not be inspected on Thursday by his team.His team found a partly burned rifle, which may have been left by a police officer who was among the passengers who survived, Salahuddin said, adding that there was no sign of a bomb explosion at least in the upper decks that they managed to inspect.The steel-hulled ferry could accommodate up to 430 people and was not overcrowded, said another coast guard official, Commodore Rejard Marfe.According to the manifest, it was carrying 205 passengers and a 35-member crew, Marfe said. In addition, it had a security contingent of four coast guard marshals, who all survived. Eight soldiers were traveling to Sulu.Threats posed by Muslim insurgents, including those aligned with the Islamic State group, remain a security issue in the southern Philippines, where cargo and passenger ships are provided extra security by the coast guard and other law enforcement agencies in vulnerable regions.Marfe said officials are investigating whether the 33-year-old ferry was seaworthy, if there were passengers not listed on the manifest, and whether the crew properly guided passengers to safety.Sea accidents are common in the Philippines because of frequent storms, badly maintained vessels, overcrowding and spotty enforcement of safety regulations, especially in remote provinces.In December 1987, the ferry Dona Paz sank after colliding with a fuel tanker, killing more than 4,300 people in the world’s worst peacetime maritime disaster.___Find more of AP’s Asia-Pacific coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific",2023/03/31,,World

The crane suddenly overturned and the truck it was based on lifted off the ground and a drain cover was shattered, but workers were able to avoid injury.Kaohsiung City Labor Affairs Bureau dispatched personnel to the scene to investigate the cause of the accident. Based on a preliminary investigation, the vehicle's outriggers had been placed on unstable ground with insufficient load-bearing capacity and the crew had not laid iron plates and pad reinforcements.They found that one of the outriggers had been placed on a drain cover, and it caved in, causing the crane to be unstable as it hoisted heavy steel bards. Workers were able to move out of the way of the collapsing crane and were not harmed.The bureau stated that in failing to place a solid foundation for the crane truck, the employer violated the Occupational Safety and Health Act (職業安全衛生法) and will be subject to a fine of between NT$30,000 and NT$300,000. The bureau called on all businesses to implement safe operation standards when engaging in operations to prevent accidents and ensure worker safety.(Kaohsiung City Police Department Siaogang Precinct photo)(Kaohsiung City Police Department Siaogang Precinct photo)(Kaohsiung City Police Department Siaogang Precinct photo)(Kaohsiung City Police Department Siaogang Precinct photo)",2023/03/31,1333,Society

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852454,Europe's inflation eases to 6.9% as energy falls but food up,"LONDON (AP) — Inflation in the 20 countries that use the euro currency slowed to the lowest level in a year as energy prices dropped, but food costs were still on the rise, keeping pressure on the European Central Bank to hike interest rates further.Consumer prices in the eurozone jumped 6.9% in March from a year earlier, down from 8.5% in February, according to data released Friday by the European Union’s statistics agency, Eurostat.Eurozone inflation has been easing since peaking at 10.6% in October, and the latest figure is slightly below what most economists had expected. It reflects significant drops in some of the continent's bigger economies like Spain and the Netherlands, where inflation halved in March.Economists looked beyond the headline number to focus on so-called core inflation, which increased to a record 5.7% from 5.6% the previous month. Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, can give a better sense of whether inflation is becoming entrenched in the economy over the longer term.""The potential for core inflation to remain stickier than hoped will be the main reason for the ECB to continue to hike in the near term,"" said ING Bank's senior eurozone economist Bert Colijn.The European Central Bank, which is trying to get inflation back down to its 2% goal, will rely on incoming data to make its future decisions and is “neither committed to raise further nor are we finished with hiking rates,"" bank President Christine Lagarde said last week.Central bankers' jobs have become more complex after the collapse of two U.S. banks, including Silicon Valley Bank, were sparked in part by rapid interest rate rises aimed at taming inflation. The ensuing global financial turmoil forced the takeover of troubled Swiss lender Credit Suisse by rival UBS and raised concerns about the fallout in already-weak major economies.Despite that, the ECB, U.S. Federal Reserve and Bank of England all raised interest rates this month as they focus on combating price spikes. Inflation stood at 6% in the U.S. and 10.4% in the United Kingdom in February.In the eurozone, prices for food, alcohol and tobacco rose by a painful 15.4%, faster than the previous month's 15%, in a sign that European consumers are still getting squeezed.Energy prices, however, fell 0.9% — an abrupt change of direction after rising at double-digit rates over the past year. The plunge was expected after the costs of oil and natural gas surged in March 2022, when Russia invaded Ukraine.The war notably pushed up prices for natural gas used to heat homes and generate electricity last year as Russia largely cut off supplies to Europe, fueling overall inflation. The latest reading indicates that a mild winter and efforts to store and source gas from non-Russian sources have paid off.Prices for goods dipped to 6.6% from 6.8% the previous month, while services climbed 5%, up from 4.8%.",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852455,"Huawei profit sinks in 2022 amid sanctions, but sales higher","HONG KONG (AP) — Huawei on Friday reported a nearly 70% decline in profit last year amid sanctions and pandemic challenges, but its enterprise sales rose as the Chinese technology giant sought to pivot into digital industries and reduce its vulnerabilities to U.S. sanctions.“While it’s true that we have considerable pressures ahead of us, we still see opportunities to grow a resilient business portfolio, a unique competitive edge, the trust of our customers and partners and have the courage to invest heavily in R&D,"" Eric Xu, the outgoing rotating chairman of Huawei, said at a news conference.Huawei its revenue in 2022 reached 642.3 billion yuan ($93.5 billion), a 0.9% gain from the year before.Its net profit for the year was 35.6 billion yuan ($5.2 billion), down 68.7% from 2021 amid pressures from the pandemic, U.S. sanctions, an increase in commodity prices and R&D spending, as well as a decline in the company’s consumer business, which mostly sells smartphones. Huawei reported a higher-than-usual 113.7 billion yuan ($16.6 billion) in profit in 2021 due to the sale of Honor, its budget smartphone business.“The year 2022 is a year where Huawei pulled ourselves out of a crisis mode. U.S. restrictions are now our new normal and we’re back to business as usual,” said Sabrina Meng, Huawei’s chief financial officer.Also known as Meng Wanzhou, she is the daughter of Huawei’s founder and will become its rotating chairwoman from April 1, a role that allows her to oversee Huawei's businesses for six months.Meng was detained in Canada for nearly three years after her arrest on U.S. charges of lying to Hong Kong banks about dealings with Iran in violation of trade sanctions. She was released under a deal with the U.S. Justice Department that dismissed the charges in exchange for her accepting responsibility for misrepresenting Huawei’s dealings with Iran.Huawei, one of China’s first global tech brands, has been caught up in China-U.S. tensions over technology and security. American officials say the company is a security risk and might enable Chinese spying, an accusation Huawei denies.The U.S. has banned U.S. companies from doing business with Huawei, cutting off its access to chips and software such as Google services for its smartphones and preventing it from selling its telecommunications gear to U.S. customers.The Shenzhen-headquartered telecommunications company shifted its focus in 2022 to growing its corporate business by selling network equipment and services to industries such as healthcare, manufacturing, transportation and mining to help them become more digital.For now, those efforts seem to have paid off. Huawei’s enterprise business revenues in 2022 grew 30% from a year earlier to 133.2 billion yuan ($19.4 billion). Its growth in 2021 was just 2.1%.Revenue from its company’s consumer business, which sells smartphones, tablets and other devices, continued to decline, falling 11.9%. Huawei was the world’s largest smartphone maker in 2020 but has since seen its global market share plunge after losing its Android license and Google services.Huawei is one of the world's biggest spenders on research and development, devoting a record 161.5 billion yuan ($23.5 billion) in 2022, representing 25% of its total revenue.Just over half of Huawei's workforce of 207,000 employees work in R&D. The company's R&D efforts have helped it replace components that it lost access to when Huawei was hit by U.S. sanctions, Meng said.Rotating chairman Xu said Friday that Huawei had achieved breakthroughs in electronic design automation tools for chips at 14 nanometers and above together with its partners, and that the breakthrough would allow it to use the tools for its chip design efforts.The breakthrough comes as the Chinese government is pushing for self-reliance in technology as tensions with the U.S. rise.",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852456,Ex-England cricket captain Vaughan cleared of racism charge,"Former England cricket captain Michael Vaughan was cleared by a disciplinary panel Friday of making a racist remark toward a group of Yorkshire teammates of Asian ethnicity in 2009, the latest stage of a scandal that has left a cloud over the English game.Other former players were found, however, to have used racist or discriminatory language in a scandal that erupted when Azeem Rafiq — a former player at Yorkshire — went public in 2020 saying he had been the victim of racial harassment and bullying across two spells at English cricket’s most successful club between 2008-18.Among his allegations, which were heard in a tearful testimony at the British parliament and led to Yorkshire losing sponsors and briefly the right to host international matches, Rafiq accused Vaughan of saying to Rafiq and other teammates of Asian ethnicity there were “too many of you lot, we need to have a word about that.” Vaughan was alleged to have made the comment on the sidelines of a Twenty20 match.Vaughan categorically denied making the remark, and a charge against him — issued by the England and Wales Cricket Board — was dismissed when an independent commission published its findings from a hearing involving Vaughan and other Yorkshire players accused of historic racist and discriminatory remarks.“The panel is not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that these words were spoken by MV (Michael Vaughan) at the time and in the specific circumstances alleged,” read part of an 82-page verdict covering the entire case.Vaughan, who was captain of England's Ashes-winning team in 2005 and is one of the most high-profile figures in English cricket, said on Twitter the last few years have been an “incredibly difficult period in my life.”“At times, this process has brought me to the brink of falling out of love with cricket,"" he wrote, adding that he hopes “an inclusive healing process can now begin” for English cricket.Yorkshire launched an investigation in 2020 in the wake of Rafiq's allegations of what he called “institutional racism” at the club that left him feeling suicidal. Yorkshire, a team in the north of England which is a record 33-time winner of the county championship, later apologized that Rafiq was the victim of “racial harassment and bullying.""Seven of Rafiq’s 43 claims were upheld in a report commissioned by Yorkshire, but the full version of the report was not published and didn’t lead to any of the club’s hierarchy facing disciplinary action.As a result, the ECB chose to issue disrepute charges against seven individuals — including Vaughan — with prior connections to Yorkshire Cricket Club. The club was also charged.Vaughan was the only individual to appear in person at the Cricket Discipline Commission hearing in London that began in early March.In his statement Friday, Vaughan said the verdict “must not be allowed to detract from the core message that there can be no place for racism in the game of cricket, or in society generally.”And the CDC said the findings “do not in any way undermine the wider assertions made by” Rafiq, “many of which of course have been confirmed by the admissions of both YCCC (Yorkshire) and certain individuals.”That was reflected by the panel upholding some of the charges issued by the ECB against the other former Yorkshire players who were accused of using racist and/or discriminatory language during their time at the club — Tim Bresnan, Matthew Hoggard, Andrew Gale, Richard Pyrah and John Blain. They were found liable for a breach of an ECB directive, regarding conduct prejudicial to the interests of cricket and bringing the game into disrepute, and have 14 days to appeal the CDC decision.Another, former England batter Gary Ballance, previously admitted to the charges against him.Sanctions will be handed down at a later date.In a Twitter post reacting to the panel's findings, Rafiq underlined that charges against seven of the eight defendants were upheld and that previous inquiries have found he was the subject of bullying and racial harassment at Yorkshire.“The issue has never been about individuals but the game as a whole,” he wrote. “Cricket needs to understand the extent of its problems and address them.""Hopefully the structures of the game can now be rebuilt and institutionalized racism ended for good. It's time to reflect, learn and implement change.”The scandal led to a huge amount of soul-searching in English cricket — primarily about its record on inclusivity and its locker-room culture — and huge change in the leadership of Yorkshire.After a series of reforms and the replacement of individuals in key roles at the club, it got reinstated as an international venue.The ECB created an anti-discrimination unit in the wake of the scandal, conducted a review of dressing-room culture across England men’s and women’s teams and made a financial commitment of 25 million pounds (then $33.3 million) over five years to support actions improving equality, diversity and inclusion. Improving boardroom diversity was one of the goals, along with helping people from diverse backgrounds progress into professional teams.ECB chairman Richard Thompson said Rafiq had “exposed a side of our game which no one should have to experience.”“Given the nature of these cases,"" Thompson said, ""they have taken a clear toll on everyone involved. There now needs to be a time of reconciliation where, as a game, we can collectively learn and heal the wounds and ensure that nothing like this can ever happen again."" ___More AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852457,UK china maker rolls out souvenirs for king's May coronation,"STOKE-ON-TRENT, England (AP) — With just five weeks before King Charles III's coronation, a British manufacturer of fine bone china is busy making “God Save The King” commemorative plates and mugs for the historic occasion.Craftspeople at the Duchess China factory in the central England city of Stoke-on-Trent painted delicate gold edges on more teacups and saucers Thursday to make sure there are enough to meet the expected demand for royal souvenirs.When Charles is crowned at London's Westminster Abbey on May 6, the ceremony will be the U.K.'s first coronation since his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, was the subject of the same ritual just shy of 70 years earlier. He inherited the throne when Elizabeth died in September.Duchess China started producing china tableware in 1888. Its range of commemorative china features the Union Jack colors of red, white and blue, and come emblazoned with the words “God Save the King.”The manufacturer said the design was inspired by china produced in the 1930s for the coronation of King George VI, Charles' grandfather.“We’ve had (orders) as far afield as New Zealand and over the other side, America. It’s really reassuring that the royal family are so well liked in all these different countries,” Jason Simms, the company's managing director, said.Simms said Duchess China has struggled in recent years, partly because of Brexit and the COVID-19 pandemic. He hopes the coronation will restore some of the luster by showcasing Britain's ceramics industry and skilled craftspeople.“We are using this as a real chance to get across a great British product out into a public domain across the globe,” he said.",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852458,Biden: Feds 'not leaving' Mississippi town hit by tornado,"ROLLING FORK, Miss. (AP) — President Joe Biden saw for himself the flattened homes, broken furniture and upended lives left behind by last week's deadly tornado in Mississippi and pledged Friday that the federal government is not leaving until the area is back on its feet.In the close-knit community of Rolling Fork, Biden read aloud the names of each of the 13 residents of the small town killed in the storm after touring the wreckage. He acknowledged to residents that the road to recovery will be long and hard, but said he was committed to helping them through it.“We’re not just here for today,” said Biden, standing near an animal shelter and a hardware store reduced to rubble by the powerful storm as he addressed members of the devastated community. “We’re going to get it done for you. We’re going to make sure you can stay right here.”Biden lost Mississippi by more than 16 percentage points in 2020, but people were grateful that he came — and hopeful they won't be forgotten. Resident Paul Rice said he welcomed the continued attention Friday’s visit brought to the town’s plight.“Right now, everybody’s here, but I imagine it’ll start drying up,” said Rice, who was driving around town on an ATV to survey the damage and check on friends whose homes had been destroyed. ""We’re Americans first and foremost. And that means we all have to work together.”The president heaped praise on Republican Gov. Tate Reeves and the area's longtime Democratic congressman, Rep. Bennie Thompson, for moving quickly to help Rolling Fork and surrounding communities following last week's storm.Under a canopy set up blocks away from Rolling Fork’s obliterated city hall building, church volunteers doled out packages of breakfast sausages and pancakes with syrup Friday morning. Joseph Thomas, a 77-year-old Vietnam veteran and lifelong Rolling Fork resident, arrived to claim his meal wearing a bandana emblazoned with an American flag.Thomas said he never imagined any president would come to his rural Delta hometown.“I’m proud that he is coming to this little small town. That means a lot to me,” Thomas said. “Because we need a lot of help to come through here, federal help, boots on the ground to put all this back together.”Last week's twister destroyed roughly 300 homes and businesses in Rolling Fork, and the nearby town of Silver City, leaving mounds of lumber, bricks and twisted metal. Hundreds of additional structures were badly damaged. Overall, the death toll in Mississippi stands at 21, based on those confirmed by coroners. One person died in Alabama, as well.From Marine One, as they flew from Jackson to the area hardest hit by last week’s storm, the president and first lady Jill Biden got a view of the devastation across acres of farmland — destroyed homes, toppled trees and piles of debris.“This is tough stuff,"" Biden said as he was greeted by state, local and federal officials after arriving in Rolling Fork. “The most important thing is we got to let people know the reason for them to have hope, especially those who have lost somebody.""Biden announced that the federal government will cover the total cost of the state’s emergency measures for the next 30 days, including overtime for first responders and debris cleanup. In addition, the Federal Emergency Management Agency will open disaster recovery centers in storm-ravaged counties to help residents access resources.The Bidens also met with residents impacted by the storms and first responders, and received an operational briefing from federal and state officials.The devastation from the storm is immense.Residents watched as Biden walked through a leveled section of Rolling Fork, just blocks from the town's downtown. A father held his toddler sleeping on his shoulder. Kids who aren’t in school because of the tornado crouched and watched. Just before the president arrived, a man picked through the wreckage, bent over to comb through the debris.“I know there’s a lot of pain and it’s hard to believe in a moment like this: This community is going to be rebuilt, and rebuilt and built back better than it was before,” Biden assured residents.Last week's severe weather makes life even more difficult in an area already struggling economically. Mississippi is one of the poorest states, and the majority-Black Delta has long been one of the poorest parts of the state — a place where many people live paycheck to paycheck, often in jobs connected to agriculture.Two of the counties walloped by the tornado, Sharkey and Humphreys, are among the most sparsely populated in the state, with only a few thousand residents in communities scattered across wide expanses of cotton, corn and soybean fields. Sharkey’s poverty rate is 35%, and Humphreys’ is 33%, compared with about 19% for Mississippi overall and less than 12% for the entire United States.FEMA administrator Deanne Criswell said some of the damage to the area's infrastructure will take much time to repair and that the administration will help in rebuilding key facilities to be ""more resilient” to withstand future natural disasters.“We know that these communities could be cash strapped and we want to get that funding flowing,"" Criswell added.Biden approved a disaster declaration for the state, which frees up federal funds for temporary housing, home repairs and loans to cover uninsured property losses. But there's concern that inflation and economic troubles may blunt the impact of federal assistance.The president arrived in the Delta community as a new series of severe storms threatens to rip across the Midwest and the South.According to a new study, the U.S. will see more of these massive storms as the world warms. The storms are likely to strike more frequently in more populous Southern states including Alabama, Mississippi and Tennessee.The study in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society predicts a nationwide 6.6% increase in tornado- and hail-spawning supercell storms and a 25.8% jump in the area and time the strongest storms will strike, under a scenario of moderate levels of future warming by the end of the century.But in certain areas in the South the increase is much higher. That includes Rolling Fork, where study authors project an increase of one supercell a year by 2100.",2023/04/01,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852466,MASTERS '23: A capsule look at top contenders for Augusta,"AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) — A capsule look at 10 top contenders for the Masters, which is April 6-9 at Augusta National Golf Club (listed in predicted order of finish):JON RAHMAge: 28.Country: Spain.World ranking: 3.Worldwide victories: 19.Majors: U.S. Open (2021).Best Masters finish: 4th.Masters moment: Opening with a 75 in 2018 and still giving himself a chance to win on Sunday until hitting into the water on the 15th hole.Backspin: Rahm already has won three times on the PGA Tour this year and briefly returned to No. 1 in the world. Even though his best finish is fourth place, he has a knack for following the path of his hero, Seve Ballesteros.JORDAN SPIETHAge: 29.Country: United States.World ranking: 16.Worldwide victories: 16.Majors: Masters (2015), U.S. Open (2015), British Open (2017).Best Masters finish: Won.Masters moment: Going wire-to-wire in 2015 for a four-shot victory over Phil Mickelson and Justin Rose.Backspin: Spieth is back to playing well, just not winning with the regularity he once did. But he had close calls at Bay Hill and at Innisbrook, and Augusta National brings out his best. A win and four top 3s make him a favorite just about every year.SCOTTIE SCHEFFLERAge: 26.Country: United States.World ranking: 1.Worldwide victories: 6.Majors: Masters (2022).Best Masters finish: Won.Masters moment: Four-putting the 18th green and still winning by three.Backspin: Scheffler was on one of the all-time heaters last year when he capped it off with a dominant Masters win. Turns out that wasn’t a hot streak. He won again in Phoenix and at The Players Championship. He now tries to become the fourth player to win the Masters back-to-back.RORY MCILROYAge: 33.Country: Northern Ireland.World ranking: 2.Worldwide victories: 32.Majors: U.S. Open (2011), PGA Championship (2012, 2014), British Open (2014).Best Masters finish: Runner-up in 2022.Masters moment: Losing a four-shot lead with an 80 in the final round of 2011.Backspin: McIlroy is going on his ninth year without a major and this is the ninth time at Augusta National knowing a green jacket is all that’s keeping him from a career Grand Slam. His form is good. His voice has brought him attention in the legal battle against LIV Golf. His putter will make the difference.MAX HOMAAge: 32.Country: United States.World ranking: 6.Worldwide victories: 6.Majors: None.Best Masters finish: T48.Masters moment: Making the cut last year for the first time in three tries.Backspin: Homa is good at social media without trying. He’s good at golf by trying really hard. His popularity can overshadow the fact he has emerged as one of golf’s top players who should be looked upon as a contender at any major.CAMERON SMITHAge: 29.Country: Australia.World ranking: 5.Worldwide victories: 10.Majors: British Open (2022).Best Masters finish: Runner-up in 2020.Masters moment: Challenging on Sunday twice in the last three years against Dustin Johnson and Scottie Scheffler.Backspin: He was good at the Masters before he won a major, and the British Open last year was his crowning moment. The question is how his move to LIV Golf and a limited schedule will have him ready. The short game is reliable. The long game is the key.PATRICK CANTLAYAge: 31.Country: United States.World ranking: 4.Worldwide victories: 8.Majors: None.Best Masters finish: Tie for 9th in 2019.Masters moment: An eagle on the 15th hole to tie for the lead, and then following that with two bogeys.Backspin: Despite having no discernible weakness in his game, the majors are starting to become a question mark. Except for 2019 when he was tied for the lead late, he hasn’t been in serious contention over the final hour of a major. That will change at some point.HIDEKI MATSUYAMAAge: 31.Country: Japan.World ranking: 21.Worldwide victories: 17.Majors: Masters (2021).Best Masters finish: Won.Masters moment: Becoming the first Japanese man to win a major.Backspin: Right when he was starting to show a little form, Matsuyama withdrew from the Match Play as a precaution because of stiffness in his neck, a recurring problem. He now has gone 15 months since his last victory. He had gone three years without a victory when he won the Masters.TIGER WOODSAge: 47.Country: United States.World ranking: 994.Worldwide victories: 93.Majors: Masters (1997, 2001, 2002, 2005, 2019), U.S. Open (2000, 2002, 2008), British Open (2000, 2005, 2006), PGA Championship (1999, 2000, 2006, 2007).Best Masters finish: Five green jackets.Masters moment: Winning in 2019 after going through four surgeries on his back.Backspin: Woods has played four times since badly injuring his right leg in a February 2021 car crash. He has missed the cut only once (British Open), which is remarkable. This will be only his third elite competition since July. He has never missed the cut as a pro at the Masters.PATRICK REEDAge: 32.Country: United States.World ranking: 70.Worldwide victories: 9.Majors: Masters (2018).Best Masters finish: Won.Masters moment: Playing in the final group with Rory McIlroy and winning his first major.Backspin: At any other Masters, Reed might not be a consideration based on his form. Put him under the spotlight surrounded by controversy, and he has a long history of thriving. He is among the most polarizing figures in golf. And he plays his best that way.___AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852467,"A look at each Final Four team, through advanced stats","After a 2022 Final Four that included Kansas, North Carolina, Duke and Villanova, this year's version has a couple surprises from Conference USA and the Mountain West — and not a single team seeded higher than fourth.That said, is there really that big a difference between the past two Final Fours?In one sense, not really. Last year's foursome finished No. 3, 8, 10 and 16 in Ken Pomeroy's rankings. This season's quartet is ranked No. 1, 14, 17 and 22 entering the semifinals. So it's a bit worse in the aggregate, but not as much as the names might suggest.Here's a deeper look at UConn, Miami, San Diego State and Florida Atlantic, using advanced stats:UCONN (29-8)Pomeroy Rank: 1Strengths: UConn lost six of eight during a slump that began Dec. 31 and lasted through much of January. Aside from that, the Huskies are 27-2. They rank third in the nation in adjusted offensive efficiency and 11th on defense. While they have many strengths, they're especially tough on the glass, ranking second in the country in offensive rebounding percentage.Weaknesses: The Huskies have basically two warts on an otherwise pristine statistical profile. They turn the ball over a lot (232nd nationally in turnover percentage) and they aren't very good at getting to the free throw line or keeping opponents off it.In This Tournament: Well, UConn's weaknesses haven't really gone away. The Huskies are at minus-14 in turnover differential in this tournament and minus-12 in free throw attempts. But it hasn't made much difference at all since they've been so dominant in other ways. It's probably not a great sign for the other three teams that UConn reached the Final Four so easily without really overperforming in these areas.SAN DIEGO STATE (31-6)Pomeroy Rank: 14Strengths: The Aztecs are ranked fourth in the country in adjusted defensive efficiency. Only one team — Arizona back in November — has reached 80 points against San Diego State. The Aztecs have held their last eight opponents under 65 and gone unbeaten during that stretch.Weaknesses: San Diego State is 75th in adjusted offensive efficiency. No other team in the Final Four is lower than 24th. None of the other Elite Eight teams is lower than 36th. You get the picture.In This Tournament: The stat that jumps out about the Aztecs' last two victories: Alabama and Creighton shot a combined 5 of 44 from 3-point range. Over the course of the whole season, San Diego State opponents are shooting a horrendous 27.9% from beyond the arc. Even by that standard, 5 of 44 feels like an outlier — but if it continues, the Aztecs could very well win the whole thing.FLORIDA ATLANTIC (35-3)Pomeroy Rank: 17Strengths: No, the ninth-seeded Owls aren't the lowest-ranked Final Four team, at least per Pomeroy. In fact, FAU is an impressively balanced group, ranking 24th in adjusted offensive efficiency and 30th on defense. The Owls are tough inside the arc defensively, holding opponents under 45% shooting from 2-point range.Weaknesses: FAU's run to the Final Four doesn't quite measure up to what the other three teams have done. The Owls' four wins were by a combined 19 points. By comparison, each of UConn's victories has been by at least 15. And unlike San Diego State and Miami, FAU didn't have to beat a No. 1 seed.In This Tournament: Offensive rebounds have been plentiful in FAU games so far. The Owls have 59 in their four wins, but they've allowed 48.MIAMI (29-7)Pomeroy Rank: 22Strengths: The Hurricanes have several efficient offensive options in Isaiah Wong, Nijel Pack, Norchad Omier and Jordan Miller. As a team, they can score in a variety of ways — they're shooting 36.9% from beyond the arc, 54.5% inside it and 78.0% on free throws.Weaknesses: This is sort of the opposite of San Diego State — a great offensive team that is pretty weak defensively. In fact, Miami is 104th in the nation in adjusted defensive efficiency.In This Tournament: There have been some signs of defensive improvement for the Hurricanes. They held Drake to 56 points in the first round and then limited Indiana to 69. Houston scored 75 in the Sweet 16 but shot just 37.5% from the field. In the Elite Eight, however, Miami needed to be excellent on offense to beat Texas 88-81. That may be the type of game the Hurricanes will have to win if they're going to prevail this weekend.___Follow Noah Trister at https://twitter.com/noahtrister___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/31,,World

And it prompted Colt Knost, calling the shots from the ground that day for CBS to say, “I wish I could have been here in 2000.”But this is a different cheer than it was then. It's a different Woods.The similarity is that it's still loud. Fans fight for every inch of grass behind the ropes to get a clear view. One ambitious man at Riviera climbed into a vacant TV tower and watched from behind a stationary TV camera as if he were working. He was caught from talking too much, and the beer can he was holding didn't help.Back then, Woods was trying to win all four majors. Now he is trying to play all four majors. What hasn't changed is he is must-see golf.The difference? There is a palpable sense that fans flock to see Woods knowing time is running out, for him and for them.“He's a much bigger star now — much, much bigger,” Padraig Harrington said. “Where I saw it is when he came back to the Valspar (in 2018). Back in the day, everybody came out. There was a buzz. He hit phenomenal shots. But the people coming now, you're getting grandkids all the way up to the grandparents.“The grandparents have seen him in the past, and they want to see the magic,” he said. “Back in the day, it felt like it would go on forever. There's a feeling now this maybe is the last dance.”It was a wonder Woods even made it to Augusta National's dance floor last year. He was only 14 months removed from his SUV speeding off a suburban Los Angeles road, a crash that crushed bones in his right leg and ankle. He says amputation was contemplated.And then there he was, making the cut at the Masters and hobbling his way through 72 holes. Since then, he made it through three rounds at Southern Hills in the PGA Championship and two rounds at St. Andrews in the British Open.“I've got to be able to pick and choose my events and how many events I'm going to play,” Woods said at Riviera, his only start this year. “It's going to be probably the majors and maybe a couple more. Would I like to play more? Yes. Will it allow me to? I don’t know. I have to be realistic about that.”He made the cut at Riviera, running off three straight birdies at the end of the opening round for a 69, one of them a 25-foot putt on the 17th hole. The crowd erupted, as always. That's not what got the attention of Justin Thomas' caddie, Jim “Bones” Mackay. It's how long it lasted.“He gets the ball out of the hole and the crowd goes wild,” Mackay said. ""He goes to the back of the green and it was somebody else's turn to play — and they wouldn't stop cheering. I'm looking at Tiger and looking at the crowd and I'm like, ‘I’m not sure I've ever seen this.' It went on and on and on and on.“As easy as it was to take Tiger and his greatness for granted, people are realizing he's not going to be here forever,” he said. “People are like, ‘Dammit, I’m going out there to see Tiger do his thing.'”What was it like in 2000? There was more applause to go with the wild cheers because cellphones weren't allowed on the course, and the majority of cellphones didn't have cameras.Social media meant a group of writers at the bar. Facebook came along in 2004, Twitter two years later, Instagram in 2010. That was the year Rory McIlroy first played with Woods, in an exhibition at the Memorial and the Chevron World Challenge late in the year.“I feel there's more of a connection between fans and those sort of celebrities, now more than ever,” McIlroy said. “I think there was still a mystique around Tiger and that type of celebrity, and social media has broken down that barrier. People feel a little closer. There's more of a connection there. I think that's why the response to him is the way it is.”There was awe during the peak Woods years, along with an anticipation because he almost always delivered. During one stretch toward the end of 1999 and into 2000, he either won or was runner-up in 10 out of the 11 tournaments he played on the PGA Tour.And then came the knee surgeries, the scandal in his personal life, and a two-year revival when he returned to No. 1 in the world in 2013, followed by four back surgeries. And right when it looked like it was over, Woods won the Tour Championship in 2018, topping that with his Masters victory in 2019.There was a feeling he could do anything, that he could never be counted out.“There's still the same expectation of winning, even though he's on half a leg and half a back,” Jordan Spieth said. ""I don't know what it was like from 1997 to 2008. It will never get bigger than him coming back at East Lake and then the Masters. People have realized it's like you get an opportunity to still watch Michael Jordan play in the NBA, you get to watch Ali fight. You have all those memories.“And now all of a sudden it's like, ‘I still get to go watch this guy play.’”And there's another element that made McIlroy chuckle.“It's hard not to root for the underdog,” McIlroy said. “But that underdog is Tiger Woods.”Max Homa played with Woods at St. Andrews, where the gallery is more reserved and knowledgeable, and he has been in the group ahead of and behind Woods in other tournaments to appreciate how fans respond to him.“I think people are more in awe of him now,” Max Homa said. “I'm not saying they weren't in awe, but now more so. It's like they're seeing royalty or a president. He transcends golf. He's an icon. They rush to go see him just to see him. Before, you went to see him hit a golf shot. I think we all know good he is at golf by now. They want to say, ‘I got to see Tiger Woods.’”Former Masters champion Trevor Immelman, the lead analyst for CBS, was at Riviera and was struck by the sheer number of people crammed behind the first tee — most holding a phone high to capture an image — and how the mood changed over four rounds.They were still there. They were still loud.“It's a really cool blend at the moment,” Immelman said. ""What I find is that as he's about to tee off on Thursday, because he's played such brilliant golf over the years, everybody still thinks, ‘Wow, can he turn back the clock? Can he really win?’ And then if his game tails off a little bit, then the nostalgic side really kicks in.“But if he somehow finds a way to get his name on or around the leaderboard come the second nine on Sunday afternoon, it's going to be all systems go.”___AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/31,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852493,Letter to Editor: Politics that led to Honduran-Taiwan diplomatic break-up,"On March 14, the President of Honduras, Xiomara Castro, announced her plan to form an official diplomatic relationship with Beijing.As someone who had lived in Taiwan, I was saddened by the news, but the announcement was not a surprise. Unfortunately, the break-up was inevitable, as Castro had shown interest in switching to Beijing before her presidential campaign.The history that led to this decision is also the story of the rise of far-left ideologies in Honduras. In 2009, president Manuel Zelaya was removed from office using military force.His plan to change the constitution and allow for a second term was heavily objected to by both the political opposition and his own party. With his commitment to stand alongside the ALBA union*, which includes socialist countries like Cuba and Venezuela, people imagined that Zelaya was planning on implementing a form of government in Honduras that follows the road map made by ALBA.Most of the countries in the alliance did not have democratically elected leaders or leaders whose rule had outlasted their designated term. The coup d'etat was met with both heavy opposition and strong support.What was clear to Manuel Zelaya was that he could not rely on his former centrist party. He founded a new party, which was more open about its leftist ideologies. He could no longer run as president due to his last time in office and instead, his wife, Xiomara Castro, would run for president.Twelve years later, she was elected to office. Although a lot of people had concerns due to the past and during the voting process, the other two parties were just as controversial, if not more so.Coup d'etatAt this point, people were desperate for something new, especially since the last two parties had been full of corruption scandals and accusations of drug trafficking. There were also a lot of young new voters who do not remember the past.Despite the hope for a new beginning, her government was similar to the previous ones. Nepotism is still rampant. Laws have been planted to help officials get away with corruption. Crime has also gone up.Mel Zelaya was seen in control again, despite not being an elected official. A lot of people now consider him the leader, instead of his wife. Soon enough, the inevitable occurred.The government started to align itself with tyrannical leftist governments. Elected leaders were taking interviews with Moscow-owned propaganda machine Russia Today. Honduras started to get into conflict with the United States, despite it being its closest ally for most of its history. With all of this in consideration, the next logical step was for Honduras to break ties with Taiwan.The process of breaking diplomatic ties with Taiwan shows what the government stands for. Although the government indeed asked for US$2.5 billion from Taiwan in exchange for loyalty, I believe that no amount of money could have prevented this from occurring.Being allies with democratic Taiwan contradicts the vision that Zelaya and Castro have. Once Honduras had gotten into contact with Beijing, the Taiwanese diplomats were given 30 days to leave the country. They were kicked out as if they were criminals.Despite all of this, the effects of Taiwan’s generosity are still being felt to this day. The amount of technology and development that Taiwan has donated is countless.These donations were made to help some of the most vulnerable rural villages in Honduras. Medical equipment and ambulances were also donated.Unlike Beijing, which is known for donating big statements like stadiums, only to never consider helping the country again, Taiwan cared for the people of Honduras.I have seen my Taiwanese friends pretend that their money had gone to waste. In reality, I believe that Taiwan showed that it is a force of good by helping thousands of people.Just because the government did not appreciate the contributions, it does not mean the people think the same. China’s arrival in Honduras has been met with heavy opposition.Aside from loyal supporters of Castro and her government, most people are critical of the decision. If you look at any of her posts concerning China, the comments will include discontent with the government, anti-Beijing articles, and images of Winnie the Pooh to mock Xi Jinping (習近平).Finally, this might not be the last time Taiwan and Honduras see each other as friends. The National party of Honduras has promised that in its next term, it will do everything in its power to once again formally recognize. Taiwan.Although there is doubt in my mind about whether they will follow through with the promises, at the end of the day, I am more concerned to see if there will be another term. The Honduran government has no respect for democracy anymore.* The 10 ALBA countries are Antigua and Barbuda, Bolivia, Cuba, Dominica, Grenada, Nicaragua, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and Venezuela. Suriname was admitted to ALBA as a guest country at a February 2012 summit.",2023/04/01,880,Opinion

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852513,"Ukraine marks grim Bucha anniversary, calls for justice","BUCHA, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainians marked the anniversary of the liberation of Bucha Friday with calls for remembrance and justice after a brutal Russian occupation that left hundreds of civilians dead in the streets and in mass graves, establishing the town near Kyiv as an epicenter of the war's atrocities.“We will not let it be forgotten,” President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said at a ceremony in Bucha, vowing to punish those who committed outrages there that are still raw. “Human dignity will not let it be forgotten. On the streets of Bucha, the world has seen Russian evil. Evil unmasked.”Bucha's name has come to evoke savagery by Moscow's military since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022. Ukrainian troops who retook the town found the bodies of men, women and children on the streets, in yards and homes, and in mass graves. Some showed signs of torture.Elsewhere in Ukraine, fighting continued Friday: Russia used its long-range arsenal to bombard several areas, killing at least two civilians and damaging homes.And the Kremlin-allied president of neighboring Belarus raised the stakes when he said Russian strategic nuclear weapons might be deployed in his country, along with part of Moscow’s tactical nuclear arsenal. Moscow said earlier this week that it planned to place in Belarus tactical nuclear weapons, which are comparatively short-range and low-yield. Strategic nuclear weapons, such as missile-borne warheads, would bring a greater threat.At the official commemoration in Bucha, Zelenskyy was joined by Moldova's president and the prime ministers of Croatia, Slovakia and Slovenia.Russian troops occupied Bucha weeks after they invaded Ukraine and stayed for about a month. When Ukrainian forces retook the town, they encountered horrific scenes. Over weeks and months, hundreds of bodies were uncovered, including of children.Russian soldiers, on intercepted phone conversations, called it “zachistka” — cleansing, according to an investigation by The Associated Press and the PBS series “Frontline.”Such organized cruelty, which Russian troops also employed in other conflicts such as Chechnya, was later repeated in Russia-occupied territories across Ukraine.Zelenskyy handed out medals to soldiers, police officers, doctors, teachers and emergency workers in Bucha, as well as to the families of two soldiers killed during the defense of the Kyiv region.“Ukrainian people, you have stopped the biggest anti-human force of our times,” he said. “You have stopped the force which has no respect and wants to destroy everything that gives meaning to human life.”Ukrainian authorities documented more than 1,400 civilian deaths, including 37 children, in the Bucha district, and more than 175 people were found in mass graves and alleged torture chambers, Zelenskyy said. Ukraine and other countries, including the U.S., have demanded that Russia answer for war crimes.Among the civilians killed was 69-year-old Valerii Kyzylov, whose wife survived but for whom the horrors inflicted on Bucha, her home town, are still raw.“I remember everything like it was yesterday,” she said, twisting a handkerchief in her hands as she stood at a candle-lit vigil on Friday evening. “A year has passed but I still see it before my eyes.”She cried as she recounted the horror she endured a year ago. Of Russian troops shooting her husband dead and leaving the body lying in the street for days. Of the Russian soldiers taking over her house, where she was forced to live in the basement. They would bring other civilians to the basement, she said, some with bags over their heads, and they would decide there whom to execute and whom to allow to live.“I lived with my husband for 47 years. We have two children. We had such a nice family,” she said, weeping. “This pain is so great. He was so beautiful. He was killed for nothing.”Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin alleged Friday that many of the dead civilians were tortured. Almost 100 Russian soldiers are suspected of war crimes, he said on his Telegram channel, and indictments have been issued for 35 of them.A Ukrainian court has sentenced two Russian servicemen to 12 years in prison for illegally depriving civilians of liberty, and for looting.“I am convinced that all these crimes are not a coincidence. This is part of Russia’s planned strategy aimed at destroying Ukraine as a state and Ukrainians as a nation,” Kostin said.In Geneva, the U.N. human rights chief said his office has verified the deaths of more than 8,400 civilians in Ukraine since Russia’s invasion — a count believed to be far short of the true toll. Volker Türk told the U.N. Human Rights Council that “severe violations of human rights and international humanitarian law have become shockingly routine” during Russia's invasion.Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, along with announcing the possibility of the deployment of Russian strategic nuclear weapons in his country, called for a cease-fire in Ukraine. A truce, he said in his state-of-the-nation address in Minsk, must be announced without any preconditions, and all movement of troops and weapons must be halted.“It’s necessary to stop now, before an escalation begins,” Lukashenko said, adding that an anticipated Ukrainian counteroffensive using Western-supplied weapons would bring “an irreversible escalation of the conflict.”But Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov responded that Russia has to keep fighting, again claiming that Ukraine has rejected any talks under pressure from its Western allies.Peskov also dismissed remarks by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán that the European Union was mulling the deployment of peacekeeping troops to Ukraine, calling that “extremely dangerous.”Russia has maintained its bombardment of Ukraine, with the war already in its second year. Along with the two civilians killed Friday, 14 others were wounded as Russia launched missiles, shells, exploding drones and gliding bombs, the Ukraine presidential office said.Two Russian missiles hit the eastern city of Kramatorsk, damaging eight residential buildings, the office said. Nine missiles struck Kharkiv, damaging residential buildings, roads, gas stations and a prison, while Russian forces shelled the southern city and region of Kherson. A barrage at Zaporizhzhia and its outskirts caused major fires.In the battered front-line town of Avdiivka in eastern Ukraine, a baby and adult were killed in Russian shelling, according to the presidential office. Before the Russian invasion, about 25,000 people lived in Avdiivka. About 2,000 civilians remain.___Hanna Arhirova reported from Kyiv.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852514,Finland's young leader is popular but faces tough reelection,"HELSINKI (AP) — A parliamentary election in Finland on Sunday is shaping up as an extremely close race between three parties as Prime Minister Sanna Marin's Social Democrats fight to secure a second term running the government.The election is taking place days after Finland cleared the last big hurdle in its 10-month campaign to join NATO. Turkey's parliament ratified the northern European nation's membership in the Western military alliance late Thursday.Marin, who at age 37 is one of Europe's youngest leaders, has received praise for her Cabinet's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. Her vocal support of Ukraine in the last year has increased her international visibility. She remains popular at home, but Finns are also frustrated with their country's rising cost of living.The economy, climate change and others issues that affect voters' daily lives — like education and social benefits — have dominated the election campaign. Job creation and Finland's rapidly increasing government debt are issues that will likely preoccupy the next government of the Nordic nation of 5.5 million.“Above all, we must seek economic growth and stronger employment,” Marin said in a recent interview with Finnish public broadcaster YLE. “If we don’t succeed in these two things, we won’t be able to reduce our indebtedness, and we won’t be able to balance our economy.”While Russia’s invasion of Ukraine prompted Finland to seek NATO membership in May 2022, neither the historic decision to abandon the nation's non-alignment policy nor the war have emerged as major campaign issues. Finland shares a long land border with Russia.Marin played a prominent role, along with President Sauli Niinistö, in advocating for Finland's application to join NATO, which was made in tandem with Sweden. On Friday, she thanked the countries that supported its membership.There was a broad consensus among the country’s political parties and overwhelming domestic support for membership in the Western military alliance.Kimmo Elo, a senior researcher in parliamentary studies at the University of Turku, said that Finland's pending bid played “a very small role” in the campaign, making it unlikely that Turkey's ratification would emerge as a matter of debate or impact voters' choices.Over 2,400 candidates from 22 parties are vying for the 200 seats in Finland’s parliament, the Eduskunta. But opinion surveys suggest that three parties will dominate the pack: Marin’s Social Democratic Party, the center-right National Coalition Party and the right-wing populist The Finns party.Recent polls indicated each could take about 20% of the vote Sunday. If that happens, no party would be in position to form a government alone; whichever one wins the most votes is expected to begin talks next week on forming a governing coalition.Finland's largest newspaper, Helsingin Sanomat, published an editorial that described the election as ""a real thriller"" and predicted that the tight contest would likely inspire voters to turn out. Some 40% of eligible voters already have cast ballots in advance.Marin has been prime minister since December 2019. Her party leads a center-left coalition government with the centrist Center Party, the Green League, the Left Alliance and the Swedish People’s Party in Finland.The leaders of all five parties are women, which has made Marin's Cabinet a rarity in Europe and rest of the world. Out of a total 19 Cabinet members, 11 are women.Marin has ruled out the Social Democrats partnering with The Finns after the election, citing substantial differences in values and policies. The populist, nationalist party's candidates have run on an anti-immigration and anti-European Union platform.Should Marin's party win, forming the same coalition again is out of the question as the Center Party has said it doesn't favor such a government composition any more.The populists, who also have a woman as party leader, are in turn highly critical of a goal set by Marin's government to make Finland carbon-neutral and fossil-free by 2035, calling the policy naïve and unrealistic. The Finns envision the country becoming carbon neutral in 2050 at the earliest.“Is this how Finland really thinks of saving itself? With green promises and throwing money at everything that sounds good?"" Finns leader Riikka Purra wrote in the party's recent newsletter, referring to pledges by Marin's Cabinet to increase investments in a green transition and economy.The National Coalition Party, led by former Finance Minister Petteri Orpo, shares the same climate-neutrality target as the Social Democrats but could find it difficult to agree on economic policies. NCP is open to forming a coalition with The Finns.Orpo, who has headed the party since 2016, has pledged a government under his leadership would create some 100,000 new jobs and encourage entrepreneurship.The National Coalition Party also wants to increase the share of energy that Finland gets from nuclear power. The country currently has five reactors which produce about 40% of its electricity.“One of the most important tasks of the future government is to remarkably speed up the construction of new nuclear power plants in Finland,” Orpo said, writing in a blog on the party's website that the next prime minister should make nuclear power “the cornerstone of the government’s energy policy.”___Jan M.

The experts suggested that Leofoo Village reinforce its anti-escape infrastructure, staff training, animal registration system, technology-aided animal management, and environmental enrichment.The Forestry Bureau announced that it has given the theme park one month to make improvements to its anti-escape infrastructure, train its staff, and remove trees growing too close to the enclosure’s fences.It wrote that though the fences were 4 meters tall, the amount and height of electric fence wires were inadequate. Additionally, both in and outside the enclosures, there were trees growing too close to fences, which could give baboons the opportunity of climbing out.The bureau also gave Leofoo Village six months to plant chips on all its baboons. Considering the large size of the enclosure, which measures 4 hectares, and the diversity of the habitat’s terrain, zookeepers and experts said chip implants would be the best way of keeping track of the baboons.Experts also suggested that the theme park make environmental enrichment improvements, install automated cameras in the enclosure to observe the baboons’ habits, and add perches and feeding spots for the baboons.",2023/03/31,824,Environment

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852553,Belarus: Lukashenko blames West for threat of nuclear war,"Belarusian leader  Alexander Lukashenko warned Friday that Western support for Kyiv increased the likelihood of a nuclear war.""As a result of the efforts of the United States and its satellites, a full-scale war has been unleashed in (Ukraine) ... a third world war with nuclear fires looms on the horizon,"" said Lukashenko, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin.In an annual address to lawmakers and government officials, he called for an immediate cease-fire in Ukraine.""All territorial, reconstruction, security and other issues can and should be settled at the negotiation table, without preconditions,"" Lukashenko said.The Kremlin dismissed his call, saying it could not achieve the goals of its ""special military operation"" in this way.Lukashenko also welcomed Putin's plans to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, saying it would safeguard his country from a possible invasion from neighboring Poland.""Take my word for it, I have never deceived you. They are preparing to invade Belarus, to destroy our country,"" Lukashenko said without providing any evidence for the claim.Lukashenko's warning echoes Putin's repeated statements that the risk of a nuclear war was increasing.In February, Putin signed a bill formally suspending the last remaining nuclear arms treaty with the United States.On Saturday, he announced  Russia would deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, the first time since the mid-1990s that Moscow would base arms outside the country.Putin's decision followed his repeated warnings that Moscow was ready to use ""all available means,"" a reference to its nuclear arsenal, to fend off attacks on Russian territory.Lukashenko said Russia would be forced to use ""the most terrible weapon"" if it felt threatened.""It is impossible to defeat a nuclear power. If the Russian leadership understands that the situation threatens to cause Russia's disintegration, it will use the most terrible weapon. This cannot be allowed,"" he said.lo/sms (AFP, Reuters)",2023/03/31,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852554,Hungary’s big bet on batteries — and its costs,"The sound of whirring, rattling and bleeping fills the springtime air as excavators and dump trucks prepare a vast stretch of land in eastern Hungary for its new purpose: to host one of Europe's biggest electric vehicle (EV) battery factories.Here, on the outskirts of the city of Debrecen, the scale of Hungary's ambitions to adapt to the electric transition is visible. Chinese-owned Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited (CATL) is building its new gigafactory, which will occupy over 200 hectares — over 280 football fields — once finished.By the end of the decade, the factory will be churning out 100 gigawatt hours (GWh) of battery capacity each year. This would be enough to equip a million cars (based on current EV capacities) and make Hungary one of the main manufacturers in Europe — in line with the government's plans to become ""a great power” of battery production.The strategic shift follows the trend of one of Hungary's key industries: the automotive sector, which accounted for around 5% of the country's GDP in 2021. As combustion engines are being phased out, Hungary does not want to be left in the dust.About a kilometer from the industrial zone, a bumpy dirt road leads to a handful of houses and a small farm. Albertné Lovas and her husband have been growing cabbage here for the past 35 years.Now they are worried that the new plant will be a health hazard for their crops as well as people in the area, despite promises to monitor the environmental impact. Lovas is particularly concerned about the industrial water consumption in the already arid region: ""We have not been able to irrigate with water from the river for five years now, because it's been so dry,"" she told DW.Many locals share her worries. Making batteries is a water-intensive business, and in recent years droughts have been getting more frequent across Hungary.It's unclear just how much water the plant will eventually need. That's because reliable information on the project is hard to come by and is only released in fragments, Márton Völgyesi complains. A chef by profession, he is one of the organizers behind a local initiative called 'Debreceners against the battery factory'.""When it's about popping champagne, the plant is 220 hectares. When it comes to regulation, it's suddenly 65 hectares,"" Völgyesi claimed, referring to the different construction stages of the project being approved separately. ""We want to see information on the capacity of the whole investment, not just parts.""Intransparent communication is a key point of frustration for locals, who feel the decision for the investment was made without their consent. According to a recent survey, almost two thirds of residents view the battery plant critically.Many of them are taking to the streets, demanding to stop the project, or at least put the matter to the vote. ""The aim is to get a referendum and to at least stop the further expansion of the plant,” says Völgyesi. His group handed in a petition in February and is still waiting for an answer from the city hall.When contacted by DW, the mayor declined to comment. A CATL spokesperson told DW that they are observing the protests but do not wish to comment on them, adding that resistance is largely based on misunderstandings and false information.Residents and experts alike are further concerned about the amount of energy a plant of this size will need. While CATL says it is investing in renewables and aiming for carbon neutrality, with Hungary's current energy infrastructure this will not be feasible anytime soon. Three new gas plants have recently been announced to supply the industry, which will continue to rely on Russian gas through 2050.Apart from keeping up Hungary's energy dependency on Russia, experts warn that the project in Debrecen will mean increased reliance on China. The plant would make China the second biggest foreign investor in the country, sparking fears that it could use its economic clout to exert political pressure.Nonetheless, the government has gone deep into its pockets to attract Chinese companies: CATL alone has been promised € 800 million in tax and infrastructural incentives— that's over 10% of the total sum invested.""This money is desperately missing from other areas, especially classic state responsibilities like education, health and social care,” says Dr. Dóra Győrffy, an economist at Budapest’s Corvinus University.Such a ""supportive governance environment"" is one of the biggest advantages Hungary has to offer according to a government paper, and has contributed to a boom. Next door to CATL, Chinese battery component maker SEMCORP is building its new facilities, and BMW’s new all-EV factory is under construction on the other side of the town.But all these companies need workers.The battery plant alone will employ 9,000 of them. “One of the biggest problems is whether you can find enough workers,"" says Dr. Márton Czirfusz, who analyzed the Hungarian battery industry in his recent study. Many jobs in these plants do not require specialized skills, he explains, meaning there is a risk they couldsyphon off employees from local enterprises.But even that probably won't be enough, as Hungary is struggling with a labor shortage. ""I expect that there will be high number of foreign workers in these factories,"" Czirfusz said. The company contends that Chinese workers will mostly be needed in the first two years, to get the plant running.The government has recognized this need, and has been continuously easing immigration rules for several non-EU countries, particularly in Asia. This stands in sharp relief to relentless anti-immigration campaigns in Hungary in recent years, which may now backfire as many locals are unhappy about the prospect of guestworkers in their neighborhood.With such a long list of concerns, a number of opposition parties from Hungary's Green Party to far-right extremists have come out against the project, too. But activist Márton Völgyesi would prefer to keep party politics in the background. ""I think it's much better if Debrecen's civil society takes this into its own hands. And whoever wants to get behind it, can do so,"" he saidSo far, it seems the project will move forward as planned, despite calls to halt it. Cabbage farmer Lovas says she supports the local protests, but has little hope they will make a difference. To her, it's clear that the government has put profit before people: ""They sold the country to the Chinese,” she says.",2023/03/31,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852555,Japan accused of failing to block Russia's timber exports,"London-based environmental group Earthsight has accused the Japanese government of not acting to halt imports of more than $410 million (€378 million) worth of what they call ""conflict timber"" from Russia following the attack on Ukraine.The activists claim that, despite sanctions imposed by Tokyo, Japanese business continue to buy sawn lumber (processed wood) from Russia's Far East.Sam Lawson, Earthsight director and the report's author, said Japanese consumers are unwittingly helping to fund the war in Ukraine.""After international timber certification bodies scaled back or ended operations in [Russia] following Putin's aggression, EU officials declared it impossible for overseas buyers to reliably trace Russian wood to the point of harvest,"" he was quoted as saying by Earthsight.""So it is impossible for these Japanese investors and buyers to be sure their purchases are not helping to fund the murder of innocent Ukrainians, in addition to destroying precious forests,"" he added.All forests in Russia are owned by the state, with a significant portion even directly owned by the Russian military.Ukrainian anti-war and environmental activists have described the profits still being made from Russian wood as ""blood money"" and have reiterated demands first made in March 2022 for immediate sanctions on all Russian timber and wood products.The EU and the UK were quick to impose complete bans on imports of Russian timber in the early stages of the invasion, while the US responded by sharply increasing tariffs. In April 2022, Japan banned imports of logs, wood chips and veneer from Russia, although, by that time, the move was purely symbolic. Moscow had already outlawed exports of those same products to Japan on the grounds that it was an ""unfriendly country.""The government of Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida insists that it is following international sanctions on Moscow. But Tokyo has decided not to stop importing oil and natural gas from the Russian Far East. Moreover, neither Moscow nor Tokyo acted to halt the sale of sawn lumber, which accounted for 90% of their wood trade before the war.One of the largest suppliers of the wood is reportedly the RFP Group, which has long been connected to sanctioned oligarch Roman Abramovich, the billionaire former owner of Chelsea Football Club. Additionally, a sizeable portion of the company is apparently owned by the Russian government.Abramovich sold the majority of his holdings in the company in January 2022, although Earthsight says it has paperwork that indicates he still retains a 9% stake. In the same month, Japan's Iida Group purchased a majority stake in the RFP Group. The changes took place one month before Russian forces invaded Ukraine.The Iida Group claims to be the largest builder of houses in Japan. In a statement issued to DW, the company made no comment on whether it intends to halt its operations in Russia.""We are looking at the situation from various points of view and are making rapid decisions, so as not to undermine the value of the shares held by our existing shareholders,"" an Iida Group spokesman said. ""To that end, we will try to collect the correct information and analyze it as the business situation in Russia is changing from moment to moment every day.""The Earthsight investigation also identified Itochu Kenzai Corp, a subsidiary of the Itochu conglomerate that focuses on interior fittings, as the biggest importer of RFP's Yezo spruce lumber.A spokesman for the company denied that it imports any Russian lumber from the RFP Group.However, Russian customs export documents seen by DW would appear to contradict that claim. The export records show that Amurskaya LK, a subsidiary of the RFP Group, provided ""Coniferous timber, rough, unplaned, unshelled, rough dried lumber"" with a value of around $10,300 to Itochu Kenzai Corp as recently as February 17 this year. The paperwork shows that the 22,580 kilograms (nearly 5,000 pounds) shipment arrived at Nagoya port in Aichi Prefecture.In 2017, Itochu Kenzai was one of several companies identified by a coalition of NGOs complaining about plywood linked to the destruction of rainforests in Malaysian Borneo, as well as human rights abuses linked to the construction of Japan's new national stadium, which formed the focus of the Tokyo Olympic Games in 2020.Yet another company identified in the Earthsight investigation is TM Baikal, which is based in Irkutsk and 100% owned by Japanese firms.An official of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries in Tokyo told DW that the situation is ""very complicated.""""The government decides the products that are on the list for import bans and it was decided that sawn lumber would not be on the list,"" said the official, who declined to be identified by name. ""This wood is virtually all used by housing companies but we do not know why this policy has been set like this.""The official agreed that the rules might change in the future, although he emphasized that the lumber imports ""are very important to the Japanese construction industry.""Edited by: Darko Janjevic",2023/03/31,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852556,Chelsea's win over Lyon raises specter of all-English final,"After more than two hours of hacks, miscues, bloody noses and emotional swings, the ball fell to Lauren James in the box. Stamford Bridge had all but lost hope, Chelsea's players seemed spent. Defeated. But England's rising star kept her head, if not her footing.""I like to draw tackles and I think in that moment everyone expected a shot, so I just thought: 'keep composed,'"" she told DW.While James felt she drew the foul from Vicki Becho, Lyon coach Sonia Bompastor raged at the ""injustice"" of a decision that took the holders — and winners — of six of the last seven titles, to a penalty shootout, after Maren Mjelde cooly converted from the spot.German goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger then saved two Lyon penalties to complete an unlikely comeback and seal Chelsea's spot in the Champions League semifinal.""It's amazing,"" said James. ""Maybe people didn't expect it because [Lyon] are the champions and they've been champions for so many years. But we're Chelsea and we know what we want this year.""What they want is what Lyon have had for so long.""They've called it our tournament for many years now,"" Lyon forward Ada Hegerberg told UEFA, after earlier setting up Sara Däbritz for the goal that the French side thought was the winner.""This is a big defeat for us. But we need to face it, keep our heads high, and continue to build from it.""Though the Norwegian was a little more diplomatic than her coach, it was clear that the penalty, surprisingly overturned by the video assistant referee, stung.Dzsenifer Marozsan, Lindsey Horan and Wendie Renard, players who have won everything worth winning, left the pitch with tears in their eyes. This is not a team that loses quarterfinals.Well, it didn't used to be.Lyon have been written off before, whether when faced with the rise of Barcelona or with the money being pumped into England's Women's Super League (WSL).But the French side has a deep enough pool of talent to bring Hegerberg, Däbritz and Marozsan off the bench and leave France's all-time record goalscorer, Eugenie Le Sommer, on it.After Arsenal dismantled Bayern Munich a few miles northeast of here on Wednesday evening, and with the prospect of a first all-English final very real, the threat to the rest of the continent is apparent.""English football is on the up, but we'll keep working hard and taking the positives out of French football,"" insisted coach Bompastor. ""Lyon are ambitious and want to win titles. When we don't win, we'll look at why.""In truth, she may conclude that Lyon don't actually need to change too much after losing an edgy, visceral sort of game decided by a contentious penalty, and then a penalty shootout.However, the margins are now finer than they once were, and it's hard to believe Lyon could win six of the next seven.Chelsea still crave that first one. And with Barcelona awaiting in the semifinal and Arsenal and Wolfsburg on the other side of the draw, nothing has truly been achieved yet.But beating the team that has cast such a long shadow over European football for so long, however it’s done, builds belief. It's a quality Chelsea, and perhaps English teams in general, have lacked in this competition thus far.Emma Hayes, the London side's coach, wrote in her pre-match program notes that, the last time they played Lyon in 2019, Chelsea spent ""much of the first leg trying to convince ourselves that we deserved to share the stage with them. This time we know we belong at this level, competing as equals with the very best in Europe.""Though Lyon's strength in depth is enviable, Chelsea, Arsenal and the two Manchester clubs, United and City, are increasingly flexing the financial muscle that those WSL sides tied to men's super clubs possess. Crowds are growing, momentum is building and the results are starting to show.With the strength of the WSL and England's Euros win, teams and players are increasingly battle-hardened and are making a habit of winning, even when their boss has stopped believing.""I didn't see a goal in us to be honest,"" admitted Hayes. ""It was the most character-building performance, even if it was also the ugliest.""If Chelsea are to upset the odds again and beat Barcelona, they will need that character, and they may even need to get a little ugly. But now they know that they can. And they know that they belong.Edited by Matt Ford",2023/03/31,,

The US had said earlier that there was no reason for China to ""overreact"" to the ""normal, uneventful"" trip.On Thursday evening, Tsai spoke on the role of Taiwan in the world's economy and security in a closed-door speech.The event was hosted in New York by the Hudson Institute think tank, which gave her its leadership award.According to reports, some pro-China protesters assembled at police barricades outside the hotel where Tsai delivered her address.The demonstrators were seen holding signs that read ""One China"" and ""Taiwan is an inalienable part of China,"" reports said.Tsai's visit comes amid strenuous relations between the US and China.While Washington's longstanding ""One China"" policy acknowledges that the Chinese claim Taiwan as their territory, the US does not endorse the claim and continues to be a key provider of military hardware and other defense assistance for the self-ruled democratic island.During the closed-door event, the Taiwan leader also said China deliberately raises tensions but that Taipei always responds cautiously and calmly.The world can see that Taiwan is the responsible party in Cross-Strait relations, according to the Taiwan presidential office, citing Tsai's remarks.On Friday, nine Chinese aircraft crossed the Taiwan Strait's median line carrying out combat readiness patrols, according to Taiwan's Defense Ministry.Taiwan responded by using its own aircraft and ships to monitor the situation using the principle of ""not escalating conflicts or causing disputes,"" the ministry said.""The communist military's deployment of forces deliberately created tension in the Taiwan Strait, not only undermining peace and stability, but also has a negative impact on regional security and economic development,"" a statement from the ministry said.There was no immediate statement from Beijing.Meanwhile, Tsai was on her way to visit Guatemala and Belize on Friday in a bid to boost relations with shrinking allies.Her Central America trip comes shortly after Honduras became the latest nation to sever diplomatic ties with Taipei in favor of Beijing.dvv/sms (AFP, AP, Reuters)",2023/03/31,,

In December, the OSCE Human Rights Office said these reports were credible and earlier this month, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin and several other Russian officials over the same allegations.""We continue to have concerns regarding violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law following Russia's full-scale war of aggression against Ukraine, particularly with regard to the forced transfer and deportation of children by the Russian Federation,"" Germany's OSCE representative Gesa Bräutigam said.The findings of the investigation will be presented to ""relevant accountability mechanisms"" as well as national, regional, or international courts and tribunals.Russia denies the reports and claims it took the children to safety.Ukrainian forces defeated numerous Russian attacks along the eastern front on Thursday, officials said.""A total of 47 attacks by the enemy were repelled,"" the Ukrainian military said on Facebook.The areas affected included Kupiansk, Limansk, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Mariinsk.The White House has accused Russia of seeking additional weapons from North Korea for its invasion of Ukraine.""We have new information that Russia is actively seeking to acquire additional munitions from North Korea,"" White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said on Thursday.Kirby said Russia is seeking to send a delegation to North Korea to offer food in exchange for munitions.He also named a 56-year-old Slovakian national who ""has been attempting to broker a secret arms agreement"" between the two countries.

But, as in some other team sports, Russia and Belarus were not permitted to participate in the Billie Jean King Cup or Davis Cup by the International Tennis Federation.“We also consider alignment between the Grand Slams to be increasingly important in the current tennis environment,” the All England Club said.The same conditions will apply for Lawn Tennis Association tournaments used by players as grass-court warmups for the sport’s oldest Grand Slam tournament.The women’s and men’s professional tennis tours last year imposed heavy fines on the LTA and threatened to pull its tournaments. The effect of being expelled from the tours, the LTA said, “would be very damaging and far reaching for the game in our country.”The ATP and WTA had also responded to last year's ban by not awarding ranking points for Wimbledon — an unprecedented move against the prestigious event.“There was a strong and very disappointing reaction from some governing bodies in tennis to the position taken by the All England Club and the LTA last year with consequences which, if continued, would be damaging to the interests of players, fans, The Championships and British tennis,"" the club said.This year’s Wimbledon tournament will start on July 3. The women’s final is scheduled for July 15 and the men’s final on July 16.“It's a beautiful tournament, beautiful Grand Slam. I'm really happy that I'm going to be able to play there this year,” Medvedev said Friday after he won his semifinal match at the Miami Open over fellow Russian Karen Khachanov. “I don’t know what the crowd reaction is going to be, I cannot control it, but I will be happy to play there in front of all the people. Hopefully on big courts. Hopefully have some big, amazing matches.”Also speaking in Miami Gardens, Florida, two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova said Russia and Belarusian players should continue to be banned from both Wimbledon and the Olympics.“For sure I’m just more worried about the Ukrainian people and players. I appreciate that Wimbledon had a tough time last year not giving the (ranking) points, that Belarusians and Russians didn’t play. And I think they shouldn’t be allowed, actually,” Kvitova said. “I’m just still a bit on the Ukrainian side of this.”Martina Navratilova, who won a record nine Wimbledon singles titles, said she supported the change. She wrote on Twitter, “as I said last year, this was a bad decision and I am glad it was reversed.”The All England Club said the conditions were developed through talks with the British government, the LTA and “international stakeholder bodies in tennis.”The club's statement described “personal player declarations” but didn't provide details. The LTA said the players and support staff “will be required to sign neutrality declarations” similar to those used in other sports.In a joint statement, the ATP and WTA said they were satisfied with the outcome.“It has taken a collaborative effort across the sport to arrive at a workable solution, which protects the fairness of the game,” the tours said. “This remains an extremely difficult situation, and we would like to thank Wimbledon and the LTA for their efforts in reaching this outcome, while reiterating our unequivocal condemnation of Russia’s war on Ukraine.”___AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/04/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852571,EU official says major aid to Lebanon depends on IMF deal,"BEIRUT (AP) — A European Union official visiting Lebanon said Friday that the international body will increase its humanitarian assistance to the crisis-struck country, but that more significant long-term aid depends on reforms and a deal with the International Monetary Fund.EU Commissioner for Crisis Management Janez Lenarčič said at a press conference following his two-day visit that the EU will provide 60 million euros (more than $65 million) in humanitarian assistance to Lebanon in 2023, a 20% increase from last year.But he warned that such aid is ""not a sustainable long-term solution” to the massive financial crisis that has left three-quarters of Lebanon’s population of 6 million in poverty.To get out of the crisis, he said, Lebanon needs to elect a president -- which would resolve a presidential vacuum that has dragged on for five months - and to ink a deal with the IMF, which he said “would unlock substantial financial support also from the European Union that should help Lebanon recover from the collapse.”Progress towards finalizing a $3 billion IMF bailout package for Lebanon has largely stalled.Since reaching a preliminary agreement with the IMF nearly a year ago, Lebanese officials have made limited progress on reforms required to clinch the deal, which include restructuring the country’s debts and its ailing banking system, reforming its barely functioning public electricity system and making governance reforms.IMF officials said continued inaction would leave the nation in a “never-ending crisis” in which it could spiral into hyperinflation.Lenarčič also responded to increasing angst over the presence of more than 1 million Syrian refugees in the tiny country and calls for their return. He acknowledged that the large refugee presence is a challenge but said that it “does not absolve"" Lebanon and its leaders of their responsibility for providing basic services.“The current crisis in which Lebanon finds itself … was not created by the Syrian refugees,” he said.Lenarčič added that, while refugees who want to return are free to do so, the EU’s position is that “the conditions are still not right in Syria for safe and voluntary return.”At the same time, he said the EU is not ready to consider lifting sanctions or funding major reconstruction in Syria. Oil-rich Gulf Arab countries that had previously cut ties with Damascus over the Syrian government’s brutal crackdown on protesters and later on civilians during the war, have been stepping up efforts to normalize ties with President Bashar Assad's government in Damascus since last month’s devastating earthquake.While the US and EU have offered temporary sanctions released in the aftermath of the earthquake, Lenarčič said major reconstruction funding is not on the table until there is “tangible progress toward a political resolution” to the uprising-turned-civil-war that has now entered its 13th year.",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852572,"Russia might put strategic nukes in Belarus, leader says","TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — Russian strategic nuclear weapons might be deployed to Belarus along with part of Russia's tactical nuclear arsenal, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said Friday, ramping up his rhetoric amid tensions with the West over the Kremlin's war in Ukraine.Russian President Vladimir Putin announced last week that his country plans to deploy tactical, comparatively short-range and small-yield nuclear weapons in Belarus.The strategic nuclear weapons such as missile-borne warheads that Lukashenko mentioned during his state-of-the nation address would pose an even greater threat, if Moscow moves them to the territory of its neighbor and ally.Belarus was a staging ground for Russian troops to launch their invasion of Ukraine a little over 13 months ago. Lukashenko, in office since 1994, delivered his annual address amid escalating tensions over the conflict in Ukraine.Both he and Putin have alleged that Western powers want to ruin Russia and Belarus.“Putin and I will decide and introduce here, if necessary, strategic weapons, and they must understand this, the scoundrels abroad, who today are trying to blow us up from inside and outside,"" the Belarusian leader said. ""We will protect our sovereignty and independence by any means necessary, including through the nuclear arsenal.”While Putin emphasized that Russia will retain control over the tactical nuclear weapons stationed in Belarus, Lukashenko charged that he also will have a say.“Don’t say we will just be looking after them, and these are not our weapons,"" he said. ""These are our weapons and they will contribute to ensuring sovereignty and independence.”Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday denounced Putin's plan to deploy tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus as a reflection of Russia's battlefield setbacks and its increasing global isolation. Zelenskyy argued that it also means Lukashenko has yielded completely to Moscow's control, adding: ""I think he no longer decides which weapons are located on his territory.”Putin has said that construction of storage facilities for tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus will be completed by July 1 and added that Russia has helped modernize Belarusian warplanes to make them capable of carrying nuclear weapons.While the deployment of Russian short-range tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus would put them closer to potential targets in Ukraine and NATO members in Eastern and Central Europe, it wouldn't make much sense for the Kremlin to station any of its strategic nuclear-tipped missiles on Belarusian territory. Those missiles have intercontinental range and can reach a target anywhere around the world from their positions in Russia.Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who was forced to leave Belarus under official pressure after challenging Lukashenko in the 2020 presidential election that the opposition and the West rejected as rigged, denounced Lukashenko's push for Russian nuclear weapons as a betrayal of national interests.“The deployment of nuclear weapons in Belarus put the lives of Belarusians in serious danger and turns our country into a potential target for strikes, including nuclear strikes at the whim of the two dictators,” Tsikhanouskaya told The Associated Press.Russia's political and economic support helped Lukashenko survive months of major opposition protests, and he has grown increasingly dependent on the Kremlin.Earlier in the address, Lukashenko called for a cease-fire in Ukraine. A truce must be announced without any preconditions, and all movement of troops and weapons must be halted, he said.Ukraine's presidential adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, quickly dismissed the proposal, saying that any cease-fire would allow Russia to stay in the occupied territories.“This is totally inadmissible,” he tweeted.Belarus and Russia have intensified their military cooperation since the start of the Ukraine war. Moscow has kept its troops and weapons in Belarus, although no Belarusian troops have participated in the fighting.Belarus, Ukraine and Kazakhstan all relinquished Soviet nuclear weapons, which were left on their terrotories after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union. Under the so-called Budapest Memorandum that accompanied giving up the weapons, Russia, the United States and Britain agreed to respect the territorial integrity of those countries.Ukraine has repeatedly complained that Russia's 2014 annexation of the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine and the 2022 invasion violate that agreement.Lukashenko said Friday that he didn't want to lose his country's nuclear weapons, but was pressured into doing so by then Russian President Boris Yeltsin.Speaking about the possible deployment of Russian strategic nuclear weapons to Belarus in Friday's speech, Lukashenko said that a week ago he ordered his military to immediately put the former base for Soviet intercontinental ballistic missiles in order to make it ready for use.“It's a highly technologically sophisticated structure,” he said.“All the infrastructure has been created and is standing ready,” Lukashenko declared. “I'm sure that those measures will help sober up all those hawks across the ocean and their satellites for a long time ahead and force them to reckon with our people if they don't understand different language.”___Follow AP's coverage of the war in Ukraine: https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",2023/04/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852573,"After being fired, Israel's defense minister caught in limbo","JERUSALEM (AP) — Five days ago, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's decision to fire his defense minister set off a wave of spontaneous mass protests and a general strike that threatened to paralyze the country, forcing the Israeli leader to suspend his divisive plan to overhaul the judicial system.But Netanyahu never even sent Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant a formal termination letter, a spokesperson for Netanyahu said. As of Friday, Gallant — whose criticism of Netanyahu's planned judicial changes led to his dismissal — was still on the job. Gallant's aides said it was business-as-usual at the Defense Ministry.As local media this week crackled with reports of Netanyahu considering whether to replace Gallant with stalwarts of his right-wing Likud party, Gallant remained in limbo — and even so, the public face of his ministry.He greeted the Azerbaijani foreign minister, toured two military bases and attended Tuesday's security cabinet meeting this week. On Thursday, Gallant attended a celebration ahead of the Jewish Passover holiday with the director of the Shin Bet security service, his office said, releasing a photo of him smiling beside Director Ronen Bar.“We have a duty to calm the spirits in Israeli society and maintain an inclusive and unifying discourse,"" Gallant said at the holiday toast.The questions swirling around the fate of Israel's crucial Defense Ministry — which maintains Israel's 55-year-old military occupation of the West Bank and contends with threats from Iran, Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group and the Gaza Strip's militant Hamas rulers — reflects the tensions tearing at Netanyahu's right-wing coalition after one of the most dramatic weeks for Israel in decades. It's also a leadership test of Israel's longest-serving premier as he governs a deeply polarized country and faces charges of corruption.Netanyahu's decision to pause plans to weaken Israel's Supreme Court in the face of the country's biggest protest movement underscores the complex juggling act that the prime minister must perform in holding together his governing coalition, experts say.On the one hand, Netanyahu must please his far-right and religiously conservative coalition partners — supporters of the judicial overhaul — who vaulted him to power even as he stands trial.But he also must weigh grave concerns over the plan from Israel's closet ally, the United States, as well as anger from more moderate politicians and, significantly, dissent from within Israel's military over fears the national crisis could threaten the country's security. A growing number of military reservists had declined to report for duty in protest of the measures, raising concerns that the crisis could harm Israel’s military capabilities.Netanyahu’s office declined to comment further on Gallant's unresolved situation. But the conflicting pressures have resulted in an impasse over Gallant's future and who serves as defense minister.“Netanyahu has extremists surrounding him and they want to see blood, they want to see Gallant removed,"" said Gayil Talshir, a political scientist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.Those politicians include far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezazel Smotrich, who received outsized power in coalition deals that persuaded them to join the government.But as the first senior Likud official to break ranks over the judicial overhaul, Gallant has proven himself to be “someone who is more concerned about the national interest than the personal interest of Netanyahu,"" Talshir added.Officially firing and replacing him could trigger backlash not only from tens of thousands of Israeli protesters taking to the streets weekly and from Israel's already unnerved military officials, but also from the Biden administration, she said.The U.S., which gives Israel a more-than-$3 billion annual assistance package and diplomatic backing in international forums, has expressed misgivings about Netanyahu's efforts to change the Israeli judicial system. President Joe Biden's blunt criticism of the overhaul this week — even after Netanyahu's decision to halt it — led to a rare open dispute between the allies.“The Biden administration saw Gallant as someone dependable, someone they can work with,” said Ehud Yaari, an Israel-based analyst for the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.The judicial plan would give the embattled Netanyahu and his allies the final say in appointing the nation’s judges. It would also give parliament, which is controlled by his allies, authority to overturn Supreme Court decisions and limit the court’s ability to review laws. Critics say the plan would irreparably weaken Israel’s system of checks and balances and lead the country toward autocracy.As Netanyahu met this week with potential alternatives to Gallant, such as Economy Minister Nir Barkat, Israeli media reported a flurry of proposals that would allow Gallant to stay on — including that he offer a public apology, or remain as defense minister but resign from parliament and forfeit his ability to vote against the overhaul.But on Friday it appeared Gallant and Netanyahu had still not reached an agreement.“At the bottom of all this is the realization by (Netanyahu) and most of the Likud that firing Gallant was a huge mistake,"" said Yaari. “Netanyahu is trying to stay above water, but he cannot really swim.”",2023/03/31,,World

At the time the company confirmed that it was putting all work on hold, but didn’t say for how long.In January, a mission by Virgin Orbit to launch the first satellites into orbit from Europe failed after a rocket’s upper stage prematurely shut down. It was a setback in the United Kingdom which had hoped that the launch from Cornwall in southwest England would mark the beginning of more commercial opportunities for the U.K. space industry.The company said in February that an investigation found that its rocket’s fuel filter had become dislodged, causing an engine to become overheated and other components to malfunction over the Atlantic Ocean.Virgin Orbit has completed four successful satellite launches so far from California for a mix of commercial and U.S. government defense uses.Virgin Orbit said in a regulatory filing on Friday that the job cuts will occur in all areas of the company.It expects about $15.5 million in charges related to the job cuts, with the majority of the charges taking place in the first quarter. The company anticipates $8.8 million in severance payments and employee benefits costs and $6.5 million in other employee-related costs.Virgin Orbit anticipates the job cuts being mostly complete by Monday.Virgin Orbit, which is listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange, was founded in 2017 by British billionaire Richard Branson to target the market for launching small satellites into space. Its LauncherOne rockets are launched from the air from modified Virgin passenger planes, allowing the company to operate more flexibly than using fixed launch sites.",2023/03/31,,World

The two cables connecting Matsu to Taiwan were damaged by Chinese vessels on Feb. 2 and 8, causing the islands to lose internet.Lii said the incident “has sparked many conversations about the need for Taiwan to strengthen the security and resilience of the nation's telecommunications.” Chunghwa Telecom has said two more cables will be laid to link Taiwan with its outlying islands, scheduled for completion in 2024 and 2025.The National Communications Commission (NCC) said on Feb.17 that according to Chunghwa Telecom, the cables were damaged by a fishing vessel and a cargo vessel, both Chinese. There has been speculation that the cables were damaged deliberately, however Chunghwa Telecom has said it will not comment on allegations of foul play.Matsu has also faced transport issues recently, with out of action cargo ships causing food shortages in early March. The shortages made headlines after soldiers based on Matsu wrote “S.O.S” style messages in the sand on the island’s beaches complaining about the lack of food.There have been more than 20 incidents of cables between Taiwan and Matsu being damaged in the past five years, according to Chunghwa Telecom.",2023/03/31,803,Society

The center hosts religious services, as well as a kosher restaurant and grocery.Passover, one of the most important Jewish holidays, starts next Wednesday at sundown.Investigators are trying to determine whether the suspects were planning attacks at other locations. Police have searched multiple sites in Athens as well as in southern Greece and on the western island of Zakynthos.The two men appeared before a public prosecutor, who ordered their detention in prison pending trial.A third man, who is not in Greece, is wanted for questioning and has been charged with terrorism-related offenses in absentia.Israel has thanked the Greek government for its response and said that its national intelligence agency, Mossad, had provided information about the suspects.A Greek lawyer representing the two suspects told reporters after the hearing that one of the men had agreed to take videos of the Jewish center using his cell phone but had decided not to go through with the attack.“My client believed that the third man, who has not been arrested, was in a position to threaten him and carry out criminal acts against him and members of his family,” lawyer Iraklis Stavaris said.“He acknowledges the part that was an attempt: meaning that he went and checked out the location, the scene where the crime would be committed, and he withdrew.

Things worsened for Diacre when France captain Wendie Renard said she would skip the Women's World Cup because she was unhappy with the team’s set up.Following Wendie Renard’s decision, striker Marie-Antoinette Katoto and forward Kadidiatou Diani also announced they were putting their international careers on hold. Diani, who picked up an injury this week during a Champions League game, said she would return to the national team only if significant changes were made.The new coach, who paid tribute to Diacre for the “very, very good results” she achieved, included Wendie Renard in his list of 26 players for upcoming friendlies against Colombia and Canada. He said all the rebel players are available for selection.“The most important thing now is to move forward,” said Hervé Renard, who is not related to Wendie.The 54-year-old Renard quit as coach of Saudi Arabia’s national team earlier this week, ending a four-year spell highlighted by a win over eventual champion Argentina in the group stage of last year's World Cup in Qatar.He said his goal with the women's team is to at least reach the semifinals at both the World Cup and the Paris Olympics.“This French women's team is among the best in the world, there is a possibility,"" he said. “We won't be the top contenders, but we will do everything possible to make it happen.”___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/31,,World

Ukraine wanted to continue the full exclusion, which had been in place in most sports since shortly after last year's Russian invasion.Government minister Oleh Nemchinov said Thursday that a decision had been taken only to enter events with no Russians involved, according to public broadcaster Suspilne.No ruling was immediately published and it was not clear exactly how it would be implemented. The IOC recommends allowing Russians to compete as individuals but not as national teams. However, several Olympic sports run individual and team events together at a single location, as in gymnastics or fencing. International sports federations are not obliged to implement the IOC's recommendations and most have yet to commit to readmitting Russian and Belarusian athletes.There was no clarification on how Ukraine's approach might affect tennis, where individual Russians and Belarusians already play on the men's and women's tours, and have played against Ukrainians. They remain barred from national team tennis events like the Davis Cup and Billie Jean King Cup.Ukraine boycotted an Olympic judo qualifier last year when the sport's governing body allowed Russians, including several from the country's military, to take part as neutral athletes.

The project has in recent years fallen in and out of favor with planners after U.S. officials declared it as not viable.But it may have gotten a second wind in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last year that compelled Europe to scramble for alternative sources of energy.Cohen added that Israel would also boost military cooperation through joint military exercises and arms procurements, while information sharing between the three countries’ intelligence agencies would “remain for the stability of our region.”Cyprus will host a meeting of the three countries' leaders later this year.",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852615,A key inflation gauge tracked by the Fed slowed in February,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Reserve's favored inflation gauge slowed sharply last month, an encouraging sign in the Fed's yearlong effort to cool price pressures through steadily higher interest rates.Friday’s report from the Commerce Department showed that consumer prices rose 0.3% from January to February, down from a 0.6% increase from December to January. Measured year-over-year, prices rose 5%, slower than the 5.3% annual increase in January.Excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core inflation rose 0.3% from January and 4.6% from a year earlier. Both were slowdowns from the previous month. The Fed is believed to pay particular attention to the core measure as a gauge of underlying inflation pressures.Taken as a whole, Friday's figures show that inflation pressures, though easing gradually, still maintain a grip on the economy. The Fed has raised its benchmark rate nine times since March of last year in a strenuous drive to tame inflation, which hit a four-decade high in mid-2022.The report also showed that consumer spending rose 0.2% from January to February, a drop from a hefty 2% increase a month earlier. But Phil Levy, chief economist at the supply chain firm Flexport, noted that the government revised up January’s consumer spending figures and that the savings rate ticked up in February — to 4.6% of after-tax income. That suggested to him that Americans have the financial wherewithal to keep shopping.“People are spending,” Levy said. ""People can afford to be spending. If you want to slow down inflation, you've got to somehow suppress that.''Job openings remain plentiful, hiring is strong, layoffs are still low and the unemployment rate is barely above a half-century low. A result has been upward pressure on wages, which have contributed to inflationary pressures. Even after having slowed, consumer prices are still posting year-over-year increases well above the Fed's 2% target. Earlier this month, the Labor Department said its consumer price index rose 0.4% from January to February and 6% from February 2022.The Fed’s policymaking has been complicated by the tumult that erupted in the financial system after the collapse this month of Silicon Valley Bank and New York-based Signature — the second- and third-biggest bank failures in U.S. history. The central bank now must consider the risk that its continuing efforts to cool inflation through ever-higher interest rates could further destabilize the banking system.At a news conference last week, Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged that the uncertainties now overhanging small and midsize banks will likely cause tighter lending conditions. If banks do restrict lending in the coming months, Powell said, it would probably slow the economy and perhaps act as the equivalent of a Fed rate hike.Flexport's Levy noted that at 4.6%, the report's measure of year-over-year core inflation was still as high in February as it had been in December, suggesting that inflationary pressures are persistent and that the Fed still has work to do.""You look at this report and think, we’ve got to keep applying the brakes,″ Levy said. ”The question is how much of March's banking turmoil has already applied the brakes for them.''Many American families are still feeling squeezed.“I can go get a $5 meal at Wendy’s, which isn’t even healthy, but that’s cheaper than buying the ingredients to make a meal at home,’’ said Jennifer Schultz of St. Joseph, Missouri.“Eggs started to skyrocket, meat’s gone up tremendously, a gallon of milk: staple products that our seniors needed — they were really being affected by the inflation and still are,"" said Michelle Fagerstone, chief development officer at St. Joseph’s Second Harvest Community Food Bank.On Friday, the European Union reported that inflation in the 20 countries that use the euro currency slowed to its lowest level in a year as energy prices dropped, though food costs still rose, keeping pressure on the European Central Bank to raise rates further. Consumer prices in the eurozone jumped 6.9% in March from a year earlier, down from 8.5% in February. Eurozone inflation has been easing since peaking at 10.6% in October.In the United States, the Fed is thought to monitor the inflation gauge that was issued Friday, called the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, even more closely than it does the government’s better-known consumer price index. Typically, the PCE index shows a lower inflation level than CPI. In part, that’s because rents, which have been among the biggest drivers of inflation, carry twice the weight in the CPI that they do in the PCE.The PCE price index also seeks to account for changes in how people shop when inflation jumps. As a result, it can capture emerging trends — when, for example, consumers shift away from pricey national brands in favor of less expensive store brands.____AP Video Journalist Nick Ingram in St. Joseph, Missouri, contributed to this report.",2023/04/01,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852617,"Palm weaving workshops join faith, culture for Palm Sunday","MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — As new volunteers kept streaming into the Church of the Incarnation, Reynaldo Hidalgo prepped fresh palm fronds for them to weave into elaborate designs that will be blessed at services on Palm Sunday, the start of Christianity’s holiest week.“It’s to give welcome to the king, our Lord Jesus Christ,” said Hidalgo, who has led traditional Mexican palm weaving workshops here for half a dozen years, along with his wife. “We wanted to keep a memory of this tradition.”Many Christians around the world will be getting blessed palm or other tree branches this weekend, in commemoration of Jesus’s triumphant entry into Jerusalem, when the Gospel narrates that crowds spread branches on the road before him.At Hidalgo's Catholic church, and others across the country where parishioners observe the Easter traditions of many Latin American and European countries, the fronds are woven and braided into intricate designs of up to several feet, often decorated with rosettes, ribbons and images of Jesus or the saints.It’s a celebration not just of faith, but ancient cultural crafts, often related to spring and farming rituals, that they’re eager to pass on to younger generations.Teens and younger children, some lugging their homework, gathered Wednesday in Incarnation’s basement, where the tropical perfume of fresh palms contrasted with the below-freezing evening outside.Maria Consuelo Palapa came with her 7-year-old son, Omar, “first to help the church, and to teach the child my traditions” from the Mexican state of Puebla.When she ran into trouble weaving the back of a two-foot-long palm shaped into a giant flower, she consulted Hidalgo’s wife, Isabel Tenorio, who supervised the efforts to produce more than 400 palms before this weekend’s Masses. They will be sold then, all proceeds going to the community outreach and maintenance costs of the historic church.“I would like that the community kept this going, to help our church,” Tenorio said as the woven fronds piled up on the large table in front of her and so many volunteers kept coming that some tried their hand at the craft standing up.One of the first to arrive was Adriana Mozo, a long-time parishioner but first-time weaver whose parents migrated from Mexico.“I’m very crafty, but this is wild,” she said as she tackled the green fronds, brittle and resistant at the same time. She bought one a couple of years ago that’s still framed in her dining room. “It feels like a connection to God.”The palms are kept in places of honor in many homes for a year, when they’re traditionally burned to make ashes for the Ash Wednesday celebrations that mark the beginning of Lent.“It’s a form of ratifying a pact by Mexican believers with the Catholic religion,” said Elio Masferrer, an anthropologist at Mexico’s National School of Anthropology and History. “It’s a form of endorsing a social alliance,” especially for migrant communities.At Saint Michael Church in New Haven, Connecticut, Jean Quartiano started weaving workshops precisely so that a tradition brought over by nuns from Italy nearly a century ago wouldn’t be lost. This week, she’s been at the church up to 12 hours a day, training volunteers to braid palm crucifixes they will sell at Mass, to help keep the lights on in the shrinking parish.“We’re going to keep the tradition alive as long as we can,” Quartiano said.Back in Minneapolis, a high school junior who came for the chance to learn a new craft lined up for Tenorio’s advice behind a mother and daughter duo who remembered seeing artisans selling the palm designs outside churches in their native Puebla.“I was raised in this culture, where it’s a blessing to have a little blessed palm,” Kari Mendoza said as her mother nodded.Victor Ramirez came with his wife and 16-year-old son to learn to weave palms, which his grandparents kept in their home in the Mexican state of Morelos as protection against storms and other evils.Even with a finger in a splint, he was soon deftly and quickly creating palm rosettes to decorate the much larger creations.“We all keep palms as a symbol of joy,” Ramirez said.___Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852619,Berlin museum presents 100 works by artist Gerhard Richter,"BERLIN (AP) — A new show of works by one of Germany's most famous living artists, Gerhard Richter, opened at Berlin's Neue Nationalgalerie museum on Friday.“Gerhard Richter. 100 Works for Berlin” shows for the first time the long-term loan from the artist's foundation. At the center of the exhibition is Richter's 2014 series “Birkenau,” the result of the artist's decades-long engagement with Germany's Nazi past and the Holocaust.The four large canvases of the Birkenau series are abstract paintings with many gray and black surfaces, but also some red and green dashes.The basis of the paintings are four photos secretly taken in 1944 by Jewish prisoners at the Auschwitz-Birkenau extermination camp, who risked their lives doing so. Richter transferred the four photographs with charcoal and oil onto the canvas and then gradually painted over them with oil paint until their content was no longer visible.Richter's process of abstraction was based on his conviction that he could not do justice to the incomprehensible horror of the Holocaust with direct depiction.During the Holocaust, the Nazis and their henchmen murdered 6 million European Jews.In the gallery across from the Birkenau paintings is a large mirror which not only reflects the four works, but also visitors who thus become part of the installation.“I think that is what makes this work so central and so intense, that you as a visitor are really questioned about your responsibility during the time of Nazis and your position on the Holocaust,” said Maike Steinkamp, the curator of the exhibition.""Richter doesn’t give us an analysis, but allows us as viewers to form our own opinion,” Steinkamp added.Richter, who is 91, lives in the western city of Cologne. His oeuvre spans six decades in which he has repeatedly explored the possibilities and limits of painting as well as the tension between abstraction and figuration.In 2021, the Gerhard Richter Foundation committed a total of 100 artworks to the collection of the Nationalgalerie as a permanent loan which will be transferred to the Museum of the 20th Century that is currently being build next door and set to be completed in 2026.“We’re building a special exhibition room for the long term loan for Gerhard Richter in the new building,” said Klaus Biesenbach, the director of the Neue Nationalgalerie.Biesenbach added that the current gallery is “a bit smaller than it will be in the new building, but it’s as complex and as multi-faceted.”Until the opening of the new museum, the works will be presented at the Neue Nationalgalerie. Not all 100 will be on display at the same time, they will be rotated.Alongside the “Birkenau” series, there are currently several other works from various phases of Richter’s career including a large group of overpainted photographs.There's also “4900 Colours” from 2007, which is composed of 196 individual square panels, each of which is subdivided into 25 color squares.The exhibition was realized in close collaboration with the artist, the museum said.",2023/03/31,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852622,Many electric vehicles to lose big tax credit with new rules,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Fewer new electric vehicles will qualify for a full $7,500 federal tax credit later this year, and many will get only half that, under rules proposed Friday by the U.S. Treasury Department.The rules, required under last year's Inflation Reduction Act, are likely to slow consumer acceptance of electric vehicles and could delay President Joe Biden's ambitious goal that half of new passenger vehicles sold in the U.S. run on electricity by 2030.The new rules take effect April 18 and are aimed at reducing U.S. dependence on China and other countries for battery supply chains for electric vehicles.Electric vehicles now cost an average of more than $58,000, according to Kelley Blue Book, a price that’s beyond the reach of many U.S. households. The tax credits are designed to bring prices down and attract more buyers. But $3,750, half the full credit, may not be enough to entice them away from less-costly gasoline-powered vehicles.Biden administration officials concede that fewer electric vehicles will be eligible for tax credits in the short term because of the rules, which set standards for where EV battery parts and minerals come from. But they say that, over time, more EVs and parts will be manufactured in the U.S., creating a domestic supply chain and more jobs. The credits and other measures also will end U.S. dependence on China for parts and minerals, officials contend.The new rules will help consumers save money on EVs “and hundreds of dollars per year on gas, while creating American manufacturing jobs and strengthening our energy and national security,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Friday.But Sen. Joe Manchin, the West Virginia Democrat who negotiated terms in the new law that require battery sourcing in North America, said the guidance released by the Treasury Department ""completely ignores the intent of the Inflation Reduction Act.''Manchin called it “horrific” that the Biden administration ""continues to ignore the purpose of the law, which is to bring manufacturing back to America and ensure we have reliable and secure supply chains.''Referring to the proposal's 60-day comment period, Manchin said, ""My comment is simple: Stop this now. Just follow the law.”Drivers looking to buy an EV must move quickly to get the full $7,500 tax credit. The Internal Revenue Service lists more than three dozen electric or plug-in hybrid passenger vehicles made in North America that now are eligible. But some won't qualify or will get only half once the new Treasury Department rules take effect in less than three weeks.A Treasury official wouldn’t give an estimate of how many EVs would be eligible under the new rules. The department plans to publish a list on April 18, the official said.Automakers have to certify that their vehicles meet requirements for full or partial tax credits.John Bozzella, CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an industry trade group, said only a few of the 91 EV models now for sale in the U.S. likely will get the full credit, although some will qualify for half.""We now know the EV tax credit playing field for the next year or so. March 2023 was as good as it gets,'' Bozzella said.The big issue is new rules limiting the percentage of battery parts and minerals that come from countries that don't have free trade or mineral agreements with the United States.This year, at least 40% of the value of battery minerals must be mined, processed or recycled in the U.S. or countries with which it has trade deals. That rises 10% every year until it hits 80% after 2026.Also, at least 50% of the value of battery parts must be manufactured or assembled in North America this year. That requirement rises to 60% next year and in 2025 and jumps 10% each year until it hits 100% after 2028.Some automakers can meet the battery parts sourcing requirements, but few will be able to comply with the mineral provisions, said Guidehouse Research e-Mobility analyst Sam Abuelsamid. Much of the lithium used in EV batteries now comes from China.“The minerals requirement is going to be the really challenging one,” Abuelsamid said. “Setting up refining for lithium in other locations is probably going to take the longest.""General Motors, though, said Friday at least three of its EVs will qualify for the full credit. The Cadillac Lyriq, which is now on sale, will be eligible as of April 18, while the Chevrolet Blazer and Equinox will qualify when they reach showrooms later in the year. GM is working to get the full $7,500 for other EVs and intends to keep it as the battery content requirements get tougher, a spokesman said. The company said it has worked on a domestic supply chain and is building batteries in the U.S.The Inflation Reduction Act also places price limits on new electric vehicles: $55,000 for cars and $80,000 for pickups, vans and SUVs. There also are income limits aimed to stop wealthier people from getting credits. Buyers cannot have an adjusted gross annual income above $150,000 if single, $300,000 if filing jointly and $225,000 if head of a household.In addition, starting in 2025, battery minerals cannot come from a “foreign entity of concern,” mainly China and Russia. Battery parts cannot be sourced in those countries starting in 2024; minerals can't come from those countries in 2025.The Biden administration said rules governing that requirement are in the works.The new rules define principles that countries must meet to be eligible. Australia, Bahrain, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Israel, Jordan, Korea, Mexico, Morocco, Nicaragua, Oman, Panama, Peru, Singapore and Japan are on the list. Japan this week reached a deal with the U.S. on trading in critical minerals for EV batteries.Even though the proposed rules are effective April 18, the Biden administration is taking public comments, and the rules can be modified later, including the addition of countries that negotiate trade agreements with the U.S.The government says companies have announced at least $45 billion in U.S. investments since the Inflation Reduction Act was passed.Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, said he has concerns about the battery material provisions. “Free trade agreements cannot be unilaterally decided by the executive branch,” he said during a recent hearing. ""They require consultation and consent from Congress. That includes any agreements on critical minerals.”___Krisher reported from Detroit.",2023/04/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852623,Purdue's Zach Edey named AP men's player of the year,"In the days after Purdue's historic NCAA Tournament loss, Zach Edey kept to himself. He turned his phone turned off, along with the rest of the outside world.It was a disappointing finish to an award-winning season for the big man with the BoilermakersDominating at both ends of the floor, Edey was a runaway winner for The Associated Press men's college basketball player of the year. Edey received all but one vote from a 58-person media panel, with Indiana's Trayce Jackson-Davis getting the other.""The season ended in disappointment, which really sucks, but it's always nice to win individual accolades,"" Edey said. “It kind of validates your work a little bit. The last three years I've played here, I've seen my game grow every year. AP player of the year is a great feeling, it just kind of stinks the way the season ended.”Edey hasn’t yet decided if he’ll return to Purdue or enter the NBA draft.“I have no clue,” he said Saturday.Edey had 21 points, 15 rebounds and three blocked shots against Fairleigh Dickinson in the first round of the NCAA Tournament, but Purdue joined Virginia in 2018 as the only No. 1 seeds to lose to a No. 16.It was an abrupt ending to an incredible season for the 7-foot-4 Canadian.Edey was named a unanimous AP All-American and the Big Ten player of the year after finishing sixth nationally in scoring (22.3), second in rebounding (12.8) and first in double-doubles (26).Edey also shot 62% from the floor and averaged 2.1 blocked shots per game while leading Purdue to its first outright Big Ten regular-season title since 2017. He is the first player since Navy’s David Robinson in 1985-86 to have at least 750 points, 450 rebounds and 50 blocked shots in a season.“He’s kind of a one of a kind,"" Purdue guard David Jenkins Jr. said. ""I’ve never played with someone like him, probably never will again.”And to think, Edey didn't want to play basketball when he was younger.A hockey and baseball player growing up in Toronto, Edey resisted basketball at first. He was 6-2 by the sixth grade and the natural inclination by the adults was to push him toward basketball, where his size would be a massive advantage.“It was something I kind avoided all my life,” Edey said. “I didn't like people telling me what I should be doing with my life and it felt like that's what people were doing with basketball. When I started playing competitively, that's when I really fell in love with the sport.”Edey developed his game quickly. He played at IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida, and proved himself against some of the nation's best high school players, drawing attention from college coaches. He ended up at Purdue, where coach Matt Painter had a proven track record of developing big men.Edey had a limited role as a freshman, then averaged 14.4 points and 7.7 rebounds last season on a team that had talented big man Trevion Williams and future NBA lottery pick Jaden Ivey.Already a tireless worker, Edey put in even more time during the offseason, spending extra time after practice and taking better care of his body. His already solid footwork got better, he added quickness and developed more patience with the constant double teams he faced — not to mention the barrage of physical play teams tried to employ against him.""There's not really any kind of cool, sexy answer,"" Edey said. “I came in every day, I worked hard, I stayed after practice — stayed a long time after practice. I took care of my body and was able to steadily improve. There was nothing revolutionary I did. I just worked hard.”It certainly paid off, even if the season ended with a huge disappointment.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/04/02,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852624,"Japan unveils proposal to promote marriage, raise birthrate","TOKYO (AP) — A Japanese Cabinet minister in charge of tackling the country's declining birthrate unveiled a draft proposal Friday aimed at reversing the downtrend, including increased subsidies for childrearing and education and a salary increase for younger workers to incentivize marrying and having kids.Japan’s population of more than 125 million has been declining for 15 years and is projected to fall to 86.7 million by 2060. A shrinking and aging population has huge implications for the economy and for national security as the country fortifies its military to counter China’s increasingly assertive territorial ambitions.Children's Policies Minister Masanobu Ogura said the next few years are possibly ""a last chance” for Japan to reverse its declining births. If the number of births keeps falling at the rate since the beginning of 2000, the young population will shrink at twice the current pace in the 2030s, he said.Many younger Japanese have balked at marrying or having families, discouraged by bleak job prospects, corporate cultures incompatible with having both parents — but especially women — work, and the lack of public tolerance for small children.To address the problems, Ogura’s plan proposes increased financial assistance, including more government subsidies for childrearing, more generous student loans for higher education and greater access to childcare services. It also aims to change the cultural mindset toward more gender equality both at work and at home. The proposal also includes increased government assistance to companies to encourage more of male staff to take paternity leave, which has been a point of contention for working fathers fearing retaliation.“While diverse views about marriage, childbirth and childrearing should be respected, we want to make a society where young generations can marry, have and raise children as they wish,” Ogura said. “The basic direction of our measures to tackle low births is to reverse the trend of declining births by supporting individuals’ pursuit of happiness.”He said he submitted the proposal to Prime Minister Fumio Kishida for further consideration. It will be part of a bigger policy package that Kishida’s government will compile in June.In 2022, Japan had 799,728 newborns, a record low, falling below 800,000 for the first time since surveys began in 1899. Many couples are hesitating to add to their families because of rising costs.Japan is the world’s third biggest economy but living costs are high, wage increases have been slow and about 40% of Japanese are part-time or contract workers. Critics say the government has lagged in making society more inclusive for children, women and minorities.Under the conservative governing party, which supports traditional family values and gender roles, women who are unmarried or without children tend to be less respected, and marriage is a prerequisite for having children.Ogura's proposal did not mention its estimated cost.So far, government efforts to encourage people to have more babies have had a limited impact despite subsidies for pregnancies, births and childcare.In a country that ranks among the worst globally in gender equality, the situation hampers women's pursuit of careers after marriage or after having children.The majority of Japanese between the ages of 18 and 34 say they hope to marry at some point but plan to have fewer than two children. A growing percentage say they have no intention of getting married, according to data cited in the proposal.",2023/03/31,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852645,The China Connection: Why Freight Forwarders are Vital to International Trade,"Freight forwarding is an essential part of international trade, connecting businesses across the globe by ensuring that goods are transported safely and efficiently from one location to another.China is a major player in global trade, and as such, the country has a significant need for reliable and efficient freight forwarding services. In this blog, we will explore the importance of freight forwarding in Chinese trade and provide tips for businesses looking to choose the best freight forwarder in China.What is Freight Forwarding?Freight forwarding is a service that helps businesses transport goods from one location to another. Freight forwarders act as intermediaries between shippers and carriers, managing the logistics of moving goods across borders. They coordinate the movement of goods by land, sea, and air, handling all aspects of the shipping process, including documentation, insurance, customs clearance, and tracking.The Key Players in the Freight Forwarding IndustryThe freight forwarding industry is made up of a variety of players, including shippers, carriers, and freight forwarders. Shippers are businesses that need to move goods from one location to another, while carriers are the companies that physically transport the goods. Freight forwarders are the intermediaries that manage the logistics of the shipping process, coordinating the movement of goods between shippers and carriers.The Best Freight Forwarder in ChinaThe best freight forwarder in China is one that has extensive experience and expertise in the Chinese market, provides excellent communication and transparency throughout the shipping process, and has a proven track record of delivering goods on time and in good condition. Some of the top freight forwarding companies in China include DocShipper, DHL, UPS, FedEx, and TNT.Understanding the Chinese MarketChina is the world’s largest exporter, and as such, the country has a significant need for reliable and efficient freight forwarding services. However, doing business in China can be challenging due to the country’s complex regulations and cultural differences. Freight forwarders can help businesses navigate these challenges by providing local expertise and knowledge of the Chinese market.Choosing the Right Freight ForwarderWhen choosing a freight forwarder in China, there are several factors to consider. Firstly, it is essential to choose a freight forwarder with experience and expertise in the Chinese market. Secondly, businesses should look for a freight forwarder that offers transparent and effective communication throughout the shipping process. Finally, it is crucial to evaluate the quality of a freight forwarding service by looking at the company’s track record of successfully delivering goods on time and in good condition.The Future of Freight Forwarding in ChinaThe freight forwarding industry is constantly evolving, and this is especially true in China, where technological advancements are rapidly changing the landscape. Some of the emerging trends in the Chinese freight forwarding industry include the use of blockchain technology to improve supply chain transparency and the development of smart ports that can automate many aspects of the shipping process.",2023/03/31,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852646,Online Learning vs. Traditional Learning: Which is Better for Kids?,"Education is one of the most important aspects of a child’s growth and development. With the emergence of technology, online learning has become increasingly popular, and parents are left to wonder which method of learning is better for their children. In this blog, we will explore the advantages and disadvantages of online and traditional learning and consider the factors to consider when making this decision.Importance of Considering Factors:Choosing a learning method is an important decision that can have a significant impact on a child’s education. Therefore, it is crucial to consider several factors when making this decision, including learning style, motivation and self-discipline, technology skills, socialization, cost, and availability.Cost and Availability:Cost and availability are also important factors to consider when choosing a learning method. Traditional learning may require significant financial investment, such as tuition fees, textbooks, and transportation. Online learning may be a more cost-effective alternative, as there are now several options available for free educational websites. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the cost and availability of each option before making a decision.Motivation and Self-Discipline:Motivation and self-discipline are crucial for learning success. Traditional learning provides a structured environment that can help keep students motivated and on task. Face-to-face interaction with teachers and peers can also provide motivation and support. On the other hand, online learning requires a higher level of self-discipline as students need to manage their time effectively and avoid distractions. Some students may thrive in this environment, while others may struggle. Therefore, it is important to evaluate your child’s motivation and self-discipline before choosing a learning method.Learning Style:Every child has a unique learning style. Some are visual learners, while others are auditory learners. Traditional learning methods cater to a variety of learning styles, such as hands-on learning and classroom discussions. In contrast, online learning is better suited for visual and auditory learners who thrive in a self-paced and independent learning environment. They might be fascinated by short stories or fun quizzes. It is essential to consider your child’s learning style when choosing a learning method.Technology Skills:In today’s digital world, technology skills are essential for success. Online learning can help students develop critical technology skills, such as using digital tools and collaborating online. Traditional learning methods may not offer the same level of exposure to technology, and some students may struggle with the transition to the digital world. Therefore, it is important to evaluate your child’s technology skills when choosing a learning method.Socialization:Socialization is a crucial aspect of learning. Traditional learning provides ample opportunities for students to interact with their peers and teachers. These interactions can help students develop social skills and build relationships. Online learning, on the other hand, may not offer the same level of socialization. Students may feel isolated and lack the opportunity to engage in face-to-face interaction. Therefore, it is important to consider your child’s socialization needs when choosing a learning method.Choosing between online and traditional learning methods for kids is a complex decision that requires careful consideration of several factors. It is important to evaluate your child’s learning style, motivation and self-discipline, technology skills, socialization needs, and the cost and availability of each option before making a decision.Both online and traditional learning methods have their advantages and disadvantages, and the decision ultimately depends on your child’s unique needs and circumstances. With the right support and resources, both methods can provide a high-quality education for your child.",2023/03/31,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852670,The U.S. to lose $150 billion due to the China-Brazil trade agreement: an OctaFX analysis,"KUALA LUMPUR, MALAYSIA -  Media OutReach - 31 March 2023 - The OctaFX experts comment on the deal announced this week by the Chinese and Brazilian governments on direct payments that will deprive the U.S. of more than $150 billion in liquidity.            The U.S. dollar has dominated world trade and capital flows for many years. However, many countries are looking for alternatives to reduce their dependence on the U.S. currency. This trend has accelerated since the U.S. and other Western countries imposed sanctions against Russia over the Russia-Ukraine conflict in 2022. For instance, Brazil and Argentina have discussed creating a common currency for South America, the UAE and India are negotiating the use of rupees for commodity trade, and Saudi Arabia has announced that it is open to trading in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.   Another step toward de-dollarisation was taken by Brazil and China this week as they announced an upcoming deal to carry out trade and financial transactions directly, bypassing the U.S. dollar. According to the People's Bank of China, the agreement will boost the use of the yuan for cross-border transactions between businesses and financial institutions, as well as simplify trade and investment between the two countries. China and Brazil will carry out transactions directly through the exchange of yuan for reais and vice versa.   'The impact of China and Brazil's de-dollarisation efforts is significant, as China is Brazil's largest trading partner, accounting for more than a fifth of all Brazilian imports. Conversely, Brazil exports 31% of its goods to China,' said Kar Yong Ang, an OctaFX financial market analyst.   Despite the active pursuit of de-dollarisation, it is unlikely that the U.S. currency will lose its dominant status owing to the significant dollar reserves held by major central banks worldwide. However, a shift towards de-dollarisation is already evident from the growing purchases of gold by central banks, which serves to reduce their exposure to the U.S. dollar. Since March 2023, the dollar has shown weakness against regional currencies, and this trend is expected to continue, possibly leading to EURUSD, GBPUSD, and gold prices rising.  Hashtag: #OctaFX

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852671,Cellulant’s Payment Processing Platform to Power Online and Offline Payments for Businesses in Africa,"SAN FRANSISCO, US - African Media Agency - 31 March 2023 - Leading payments technology company, Cellulant aims to change how businesses make payments and get paid in Africa by introducing online and offline payment solutions.            The payments market in Africa is experiencing rapid growth, mainly due to advancements in peer-to-peer (P2P) and consumer-to-business (C2B) payment solutions. However, the fragmentation of payment processing continues to pose a significant challenge for businesses seeking to establish a presence in Africa.   Solving intractable problems is not new to Cellulant; founded at the height of Africa's mobile technology boom in 2003, Cellulant is building Africa's most comprehensive payments infrastructure. The company offers a single API payment platform that enables businesses to collect payments online and offline while allowing anyone to pay from their mobile money, local and international cards, or bank. Providing alternative payment methods for African consumers is particularly important on a continent that holds 70% of the world's $1 trillion mobile money market. Card penetration sits at a 3% penetration rate - meaning global companies looking to expand into Africa need a payments partner that can offer alternative payment methods for the local market.   At the recently held 25th Annual Harvard Africa Business Conference in Boston,  Cellulant's Group CEO Akshay Grover stated, ""Solving the payments challenges in Africa is not just about payments but accelerating global economic growth. Africa's dynamic economies and lack of an established payment infrastructure have resulted in a unique occurrence on the continent. On the one hand, this has prompted the growth of payment platforms and solutions to meet the various needs of businesses and consumers, turning Africa into a centre of innovation in the payments sector. On the other hand, with multiple providers, a wide range of payment methods exists due to the absence of a consistent infrastructure enabling businesses to collect payments seamlessly or easily operate across borders. Therefore, a payments infrastructure in Africa must holistically address the needs of businesses and their consumers by making it easy to collect payments online and offline -regardless of the size of the business.""   Cellulant has built, Tingg, a payments platform that provides multinational and international businesses with a one-stop-shop solution for their payment needs across the continent. The payments gateway connects to over 370 payment methods from mobile money operators and banks across the continent to global and regional card switches such as Visa, Mastercard, NIBSS and Verve.   The payments platform has full-stack offline and online payment capabilities. It caters to businesses in various sectors, such as Airlines, Telecoms, E-commerce, Ride-Hailing, Retail and Remittances, enabling these businesses to deliver a frictionless payment experience to their customers. Today, Cellulant powers payments for renowned global companies such as Emirates, Bolt, KLM, Ethiopian Airlines, Glovo, Kenya Airways, and Jumia; and processes billions of dollars yearly.   Cellulant is ISO 27001 (ISMS), ISO 27701 (PIMS), ISO 22301 (BCMS), ISO 20000-1 (Service Management) and PCI-DSS compliant for all its payouts and collections products.  Hashtag: #Cellulant

Launched in Malawi on December 14, 2022, representing a sizeable market in its own right, and alsoconstituting a strategically important base from which to expand into East Africa, including theneighbouring countries of Tanzania, Zambia and Mozambique.                Acquired 100% ownership of Tingo Foods Plc on February 9, 2023, a recently established foodprocessing business with the capacity to offtake large volumes of raw crops from Tingo Mobile's farmersinto finished food and beverage products. Since its inception in September 2022, Tingo Foods generated more than $400 million of highly profitable revenues during the four months ended December 31, 2022.                Tingo Foods, through a joint venture, has recently committed to fit-out and operate a $1.6 billion state of the art food processing facility in the Delta State of Nigeria, which is believed to be the largest of its kind on the African continent, and is expected to multiply the company's food processing capacity, as well as expand its range of food and beverage products.

Appointed specialist legal counsel and a team of expert advisors in February 2023 to investigate market manipulation and unlawful naked short selling of stock, and take appropriate action to prosecute anyparties that have perpetrated illegal activity, and protect the Company from any such action in the future.             A special dividend plan and share buyback program are being considered as possible means ofincreasing shareholder value and to address the significant disconnect between the Company's share price and its real value (in line with valuation multiples applied to other comparable Nasdaq listed companies).      Darren Mercer, MICT's Chief Executive Officer, commented, ""I am delighted with the remarkabletransformation that we achieved in 2022. At the beginning of the year, we were faced with the backdrop of huge disruption in our domestic markets of China and Hong Kong, due to widespread Covid lockdownmeasures, and a significant downturn in the global financial services sector, in response to which we pivoted the Company both geographically and strategically, and acquired a business that is not only growing stronglybut is also addressing some of the world's biggest problems, namely food insecurity, financial exclusion andpoverty. I feel privileged to be involved with Tingo and have acquired a business whose success is aligned with improving global food supply, and also with helping Africa and other emerging markets to become foodsustainable.       ""Our focus for much of 2022 was on completing and integrating our acquisition. After completing extensive due diligence and analysis on Tingo Mobile with a first-class team of globally renown advisors, including Ernst &Young, Dentons and Houlihan Lokey, before then restructuring the transaction so as to expedite its completion, and improve the terms for our shareholders, we were delighted to close the transaction to combine the companies before year end. This has considerably strengthened our balance sheet at December 31, 2022,resulting in gross assets of $1.7 billion, of which more than $0.5 billion is cash on hand. In addition, by closingthe acquisition in 2022, we were able to engage one of the world's leading accounting and audit firms, Deloitte, to audit the combined December 31, 2022, balance sheet and financial statements. It also gave us theopportunity to engage Grant Thornton to undertake an audit and Sarbanes-Oxley review of the group's internalcontrols and procedures.       ""I am also delighted with the progress we made with integrating Tingo Mobile into the group during Q4 2022,and in accelerating the expansion of the various businesses. As announced previously, since November 2022we have signed trade partnerships that are expected to triple Tingo Mobile's customers by the end of 2023, in addition to expanding our operations into three new countries, launching two new businesses, namely Tingo DMCC and TingoPay, and acquired the highly profitable Tingo Foods business. These significant developments, and their impact in terms of closing the end- to-end seed-to-sale ecosystem, puts us into a verystrong position for 2023 and beyond.       ""The financial results for Tingo Mobile, and the pro forma consolidated financial information for the group, speak for themselves. Highlights in the pro forma income statement include the 200% growth in gross profit in2022 to $675 million, and a move from a Net Income Before Tax loss of $47 million in 2021 to a Net Income Before Tax surplus of more than $550 million in 2022. Additionally, we have experienced material growthduring the first quarter of 2023, and we expect such growth to continue and accelerate throughout theremainder of the year and beyond.       ""Having successfully integrated Tingo Mobile into the group and completed an audit with a world leadingaccounting firm, we look forward to finally addressing the significant disconnect in our share price and attract a valuation that is reflective of our consolidated earnings. With more than $500 million of cash on our balance sheet, and the launch of the largest food processing plant in Africa set to take place next year,we have an increasing number of options available to us to overcome the share price disconnect. As we continue to evaluate and consider all the options, together with our overall strategy for maximizing shareholder value, we will keep the market apprised and I hope to provide a further update in the coming weeks.""    Dozy Mmobuosi, Founder & CEO of Tingo Mobile and Tingo Foods, added: ""My colleagues and I at Tingo Mobile and Tingo Foods are delighted that we now part of Tingo Group. The completion of the merger on November 30, 2022, represented a major milestone in the history of Tingo Mobile, which my father and Ifounded some 22 years ago. We are already seeing the benefits of the synergies in the group, and of being part of a Nasdaq listed company, and our shareholders will have noted the considerable progress we have made since the fourth quarter of 2022, with the acceleration of our growth plans and globalization and dollarizationstrategies.       ""We are particularly excited about the completion of the virtuous circle of our agri-fintech eco-system, where we can now deliver on, and profit from, every part of the journey from seed-to-sale. We are also very excited about our diversification, both geographically, including within my home continent of Africa, as well as intoother parts of the world and into other sectors, for example, through our B2C and B2B TingoPay business andpartnership with Visa.       ""As we deliver on our success for the Company and its shareholders, it is of the highest importance to me and the Board of Tingo Group that we equally deliver on our mission and our Environment Social and Governance (""ESG"") goals, as we continue to strive to meaningfully improve global food security and financial inclusion, and also to deliver social and financial upliftment to our customers and, very importantly to me, help makeAfrica food sustainable.       ""With the major steps we have taken in recent months to capitalize on our merger and the Company's Nasdaq listing, we are confident we can build significantly on the revenue and earnings growth we achieved in 2022and deliver considerable value to our shareholders.""     2022 Financial Review           Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022, were $146.0 million, compared to $55.7 million in the prior year, an increase of 162%. The increase is mainly attributable to the consolidation of TingoMobile from December 1, 2022.             Gross profit for the full year 2022 was $64.8 million, or 44% of revenues, compared to $9.2 million, or 16% of revenues, in the prior year. The increase is mainly attributable to the consolidation of Tingo Mobile for the month of December, as well as to the growth in the margins of the Company's insuranceagency business.             Selling & marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022, were $11.1 million as comparedto $6.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was due to the consolidation ofsuch costs from Tingo Mobile for the month of December, and an increase in marketing expenses for the Company's insurance businesses, which is offset in part by a decrease in marketing expenses for thestock trading businesses.             General and administrative expenses were $58.2 million in the full year 2022, compared to $36.5 million in the full year 2021, which is mainly attributed to the consolidation of such costs from Tingo Mobile for the month of December. General and administrative expenses for the year included $9.6million of non-recurring transaction expenses and share based payments totalling $6.6 million, representing a decrease in share-based payments of $4.7 million compared to theprevious year.              Operating loss for the for the year ended December 31, 2022, was $11.8 million versus a loss of $37.9 million for the prior year. The decrease in loss from operations is mainly attributable to the consolidationof the profitable operations of Tingo Mobile for the month of December.         Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2022, was $47.1 million compared to $36.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, mainly as a result of an increase in tax expenses relating to the acquisition and consolidation of Tingo Mobile.         As of December 31, 2022, the Company's cash and cash equivalents on a consolidated basis was approximately $500.3 million, compared to $96.6 million at December 31, 2021.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852681,Biden to Russia on detained US journalist: 'Let him go',"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden on Friday urged Russia to release Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, who was arrested on espionage charges — allegations the newspaper denies.“Let him go,” Biden told reporters at the White House when asked about his message to Russia on the arrest of Gershkovich.Russia’s Federal Security Service has accused Gershkovich, a U.S. citizen, of trying to obtain classified information. It is the first time an American journalist has been detained in Russia on accusations of spying since the Cold War. The Journal has said it “vehemently denies” the charges.Speaking at a news conference in Lusaka, Zambia, Vice President Kamala Harris added that the administration was “deeply concerned” about Gershkovich's arrest.“We will not tolerate — and condemn, in fact — repression of journalists,” Harris said during a weeklong visit to Africa.The Biden administration said Thursday it was working to secure U.S. consular access to Gershkovich. Asked Friday whether he would expel Russian diplomats or journalists in the U.S., Biden responded: “That’s not the plan right now.”Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, called the targeting of U.S. citizens in Russia “unacceptable” and said the administration condemns the detention of Gershkovich ""in the strongest terms.”The Biden administration has also warned U.S. citizens not to travel to Russia, and for Americans in the country to depart immediately.In Moscow, Dmitry Muratov, Nobel Peace Prize-winning editor-in-chief of the Novaya Gazeta newspaper, told reporters he knows the detained journalist and “Gershkovich was not an agent using his professional and journalistic accreditation as a cover for espionage.”Speaking more generally of the Kremlin's repression of independent journalism, which has intensified since Russia invaded Ukraine, Muratov said: ""This is a trend — trying to attribute espionage and treason to people at every step, to show that the profession of a journalist is an enemy profession for the country — for Russian and other journalists.”___Associated Press reporter Chris Megerian contributed to this report from Lusaka, Zambia.",2023/04/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852682,Justice Department sues Norfolk Southern over derailment,"The federal government filed a lawsuit against railroad Norfolk Southern over environmental damage caused by a train derailment on the Ohio-Pennsylvania border that spilled hazardous chemicals into nearby creeks and rivers.The U.S. Department of Justice said it's seeking to hold the company accountable for “unlawfully polluting the nation’s waterways and to ensure it pays the full cost of the environmental cleanup,” in the lawsuit filed Thursday.It's asking for fines under the Clean Water Act and for a judgment to hold the railroad accountable for past and future costs.The derailment in early February led to the evacuation of half of the 5,000 residents of East Palestine when responders intentionally burned toxic chemicals in some of the derailed cars to prevent an uncontrolled explosion.Chemicals from the derailed cars and firefighting foam seeped into creeks and rivers near the village, with some eventually ending up in the Ohio River. So far, more than 9 million gallons (34 million liters) of wastewater have been removed from the site and hauled to hazardous waste storage sites in Ohio and other states, according to the state officials.Government officials say tests haven’t found dangerous levels of chemicals in the air or water in the area, but many residents remain concerned about their long-term health.The Ohio Department of Natural Resources said three weeks after the disaster that the spilled contaminants killed an estimated 44,000 fish, mostly small ones such as minnows.Norfolk Southern CEO Alan Shaw has repeatedly apologized for the impact the derailment and the company has pledged to pay for the cleanup. The railroad has promised so far to spend close to $28 million to help the Ohio community recover while also announcing several voluntary safety upgrades.Connor Spielmaker, a spokesperson for Norfolk Southern, said the company is focused on the cleanup and working at the direction of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.“Our job right now is to make progress every day cleaning up the site, assisting residents whose lives were impacted by the derailment, and investing in the future of East Palestine and the surrounding areas,” he said in a statement.Ohio filed a lawsuit against Norfolk Southern just over two weeks ago to make sure it pays for the cleanup and environmental damage, and pays for groundwater and soil monitoring in the years ahead.",2023/04/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852683,Prosecutors in Senegal appeal opposition leader's sentence,"DAKAR, Senegal (AP) — Prosecutors in Senegal who had sought two years in prison for opposition leader Ousmane Sonko have filed an appeal after he was given a much lighter, two-month suspended sentence for his conviction on libel charges in a case his supporters say was politically motivated.The outcome of Thursday's verdict allows Sonko to run for president next year though he still faces unrelated criminal charges in a pending rape case that would disqualify him if he is convicted. Sonko is widely viewed as the top opposition candidate in Senegal's elections next year.Sonko has not yet decided whether to appeal the sentence in the libel case, his lawyer Bamba Cisse told The Associated Press.Sonko was also ordered to pay about $330,000 to Tourism Minister Mame Mbaye Niang, who accused the politician of defamation and public insults.Neither Sonko nor his lawyers were present on Thursday when the verdict and sentence were delivered.Each of Sonko's previous court appearances led to protests in the streets of Dakar, the capital, and Sonko himself was forcibly removed from his vehicle by police on two occasions. Demonstrations have taken place not only in Dakar but in cities throughout the country.Sonko’s supporters see the charges against him as the latest attempt to cut short his political career. Sonko finished third in Senegal’s 2019 presidential election and has called on President Macky Sall to declare publicly that he won’t seek a third term.The ruling party says Sall should be allowed to run after a constitutional change in 2016 — made while Sall was president — which changed presidential terms to five years.Sonko also faces rape charges based on accusations from a female employee of a massage salon who said she was assaulted by him. If convicted, he faces up to 10 years in prison and would be barred from running for president. No date has been set yet for the that trial.",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852684,Joshua at heaviest career fighting weight against Franklin,"LONDON (AP) — Anthony Joshua will come in at the heaviest fighting weight of his career when he takes on Jermaine Franklin in London on Saturday.Joshua, a former two-time world heavyweight champion, weighed in Friday at 255.4 pounds (115.8 kilograms) for the fight at the O2 Arena.That is nearly 11 pounds (5kg) heavier than his last fight, the second straight loss to Oleksandr Usyk in Saudi Arabia in August.Joshua said he has eaten more and focused less on lifting weights during his training camp in Dallas, Texas, with new trainer Derrick James.The British boxer is looking to get back into contention for world title fights by beating Franklin, who weighed 234.1 pounds (106.2kg) — 23 pounds (10.5kg) lighter than when he lost for the first time in his career in November to Dillian Whyte.___More AP boxing: https://apnews.com/hub/boxing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852685,Gwyneth Paltrow scores court win that means more than $1,"PARK CITY, Utah (AP) — All that for a dollar?Nah, Gwyneth Paltrow ’s motivation to go to trial to fight a lawsuit accusing her of sending a fellow skier “absolutely flying” at a posh Utah ski resort in 2016 was about vindication.She got it when a jury found her not at fault in the collision, granting her exactly the $1 she sought in her countersuit. As a court reporter read the verdict, the courtroom gallery made up mostly of her supporters exhaled while Paltrow sat next to her lawyer intently and avoided displaying emotion that could be interpreted as surprise or gloating.She might have come out ahead in the court of public opinion, too, Hollywood lawyers and publicists say.“It’s not often that you go through the whole expense and time and bother of litigation for a dollar,” said Tre Lovell, a Los Angeles lawyer who handles many celebrity cases. “But she wanted to turn this into a positive as a way of saying ‘I’m not going to get taken advantage of,’ and ‘I’m a good person.’”The actor-turned-influencer avoided engaging in any memorable missteps during the eight-day trial that she attended every day as viewers in Park City, Utah, and around the world watched closely. She even ended things on a classy note when she stopped before leaving court to lean over and tap her accuser’s shoulder to wish him best of luck.“She came across on the stand very well,” said Emily D. Baker, legal analyst and former Los Angeles deputy district attorney. “She was personable, she was firm, but she wasn’t ever aggressive. And it actually came across that she had empathy for what this plaintiff has gone through.”When 76-year-old Terry Sanderson filed the lawsuit in 2019, it was the kind of case that seemed to scream for the quick, confidential settlement typical in lawsuits against celebrities. Instead, it endured for four years through trial.“I felt that acquiescing to a false claim compromised my integrity,” Paltrow posted to her 8.3 million Instagram followers after the verdict.Sanderson himself questioned afterward whether the lawsuit was worth it and said he believed that people tend to naturally trust celebrities like Paltrow.Juror Samantha Imrie said in an interview on Good Morning America that it was evidence, not Paltrow's celebrity, that swayed the jury. She said Sanderson seemed to be telling “his truth” but she thought it was “distorted.” Imrie, a 31-year-old nurse, said she found Paltrow's testimony convincing.“I think, you know, there was in the back of my mind, ‘Yes, this woman’s an actress,’ and you know, I took that into account,” Imrie said. “But, I didn’t feel that she had a reason to lie under oath. She’s always in the spotlight, so she always has to be honest.”Holly Baird, a publicist who handles major celebrity crises including many court cases, says that while trials have potential downsides, there is no reason for famous people to avoid them at all costs.“I didn’t see this being a downfall for her,” Baird said. “This isn’t like a murder case or anything. It humanizes her. People have similar stories.”There were moments of potential pitfall, as when Paltrow answered a question about damages by saying she “had lost half a day of skiing,” acknowledged paying nearly $9,000 for her then-small kids' skiing instruction and explained why she let her ski instructor stay behind to check on Sanderson and exchange information. As he waited to be tobogganed down the mountain by ski patrol, she followed her children Moses and Apple down the mountain, testifying that she was accustomed to having things done for her.But the honest answer may not have done her damage.“They live in a different world and it becomes their normal, but people are going to assume that,” Lovell said. “You can have that and people are going to know it and accept. You’ve just got to come across as humble.”Baird agreed.“I think she was authentic,” she said. “She’s with her children, she’s worried about them.”The jury apparently found Paltrow likeable enough, returning after just 2 1/2 hours to give her a resounding win that blamed the collision 100% on Sanderson. Paltrow was awarded the $1 she requested in her countersuit, a symbolic amount that mirrored Taylor Swift’s response to a radio host’s defamation lawsuit. Swift was awarded $1 in 2017. She may also be awarded money to pay attorney fees, a decision that rests with the judge. He had not posted a decision on the online court docket as of Friday.His lawsuit had sought more than $300,000, though in closing arguments, his attorneys estimated damages as more than $3.2 million.Trial lawyers are known to regularly engage in seemingly friendly repartee with witnesses to try and cultivate sympathy among the jury. But many observers thought Sanderson's attorney Kristin VanOrman did the actor a major favor when she at times appeared charmed by Paltrow when she was on the stand.When VanOrman asked Paltrow her height and she responded “just under 5'10”,” VanOrman replied, “I am so jealous! I think I’m shrinking. I have to wear heels just to make it to 5’5”.”VanOrman's efforts to flag for the jury that Paltrow was larger than the man she collided with were overshadowed when the actor said back: “They’re very nice.”Lovell said it was so “bizarre and ineffective” that he thought VanOrman was Paltrow's attorney when he first tuned in.“That was ridiculous,” she said. “The jury sees that and thinks she must not be that bad if the opposing attorney likes her. She seemed star struck.”Once among the most ubiquitous leading women in Hollywood, the Oscar winner has taken fewer and fewer roles in recent years. Many now identify her more with her wellness-and-lifestyle company Goop, whose offerings have brought her ridicule in some quarters as the quintessential out-of-touch peddler of celebrity woo-woo.But that also makes Paltrow her own boss, who is not beholden to others for work, and has brought her a devoted set of customer-fans.“Gwyneth has such a cult following in the lifestyle and wellness brand, and people love to see another side of their life like this,” Baird said. “I think her PR team should be using it. She’s getting way more TV time than she would any other way.”Paltrow’s fight to clear her name resonated with many of her fans, including those who braved blizzards to fill the gallery of the Park City courtroom for two weeks.“When you are a celebrity you know that you’re going to get some of this, but that was totally over the top,” said Ann Malcolm, a Park City local who enjoys skiing at Deer Valley, the mountain where Paltrow and Sanderson crashed.A crowd made up of locals and some who traveled from California to catch a glimpse of the trial snapped selfies, showed each other mockups of t-shirts that read “#Gwynnocent” and commended Paltrow for being both gracious and fighting to clear her name.“He thought it would be an easy payday,” said David Madow, a retired dentist and avid skier who attended multiple days of court proceedings. “I was impressed with the fact that she said ‘No, I’m not gonna do that.’”___Dalton reported from Los Angeles.___Associated Press Writer Krysta Fauria contributed.",2023/04/01,,World
