https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801700,The last days of Taiwan Buddhist Master Hsing Yun,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The death of a revered monk is often the stuff of legend, accompanied by a remarkable set of coincidences that signify something extraordinary has happened.In the case of 95-year-old Master Hsing Yun (星雲), he was a revered Buddhist monk and the founder of Fo Guang Shan (佛光山), located just outside Kaohsiung. His death was accompanied by a number of signs which could be interpreted as auspicious, indicating it was time for his soul to leave human form.To begin with, he died on the 15th of the Lunar New Year, precisely at 5 p.m. on the evening of Feb. 5, a confluence of the number “555” potentially reflecting sadness or great fortune depending upon one’s perspective. It is also a coincidence that he passed away on the day of the Lantern Festival as the Mandarin character for light “光"" plays a prominent role in the name of his religious order as well as his foundation.According to locals, Fo Guang Shan had planned to release sky lanterns to celebrate this traditional holiday but canceled such plans at the last minute without any explanation. Only later did locals learn of Master Hsing Yun's hospitalization, and with fewer lanterns bearing wishes heavenward, it is thought Hsing Yun's spirit could ascend unimpeded.In his final years, he had been hobbled by a stroke and confined to a wheelchair as his legs were unstable and infirm due to diabetes.His condition was so severe he traveled to Kaohsiung Chang Gung Hospital every two days for kidney dialysis. This pain and discomfort did little to dent his willpower, as he was overheard telling doctors and nurses about his belief in reincarnation, an act that could be as simple as a change of clothes, and simply put, “monks do not fear death.”When word of his death leaked to the public on Monday (Feb. 6), Fo Guang Shan welcomed the media and responded to questions regarding the passage of their master. Hsing Yun’s health had been flagged in recent years and he kept a dedicated staff at Chang Gung Hospital to care for him under the direction of Chen Zhaolung, an authority on liver transplants.According to a UDN report, people close to Master Hsing Yun said that he was admitted to the hospital’s intensive care unit before the Lunar New Year, and resided at the hospital for about three weeks.After discussions with the medical team, he took a private car leaving Chang Gung Hospital at 3:00 p.m. on Sunday (Feb. 5) and passed away on the grounds of Fo Guang Shan around 5:00 p.m. People close to the master and his condition said, “the master returned to the place he thought of in his heart, and went very peacefully.""Fo Guang Shan Master Hui-Chuan (慧傳) addressed the media stating that Hsing Yun never feared death as he repeated many times that “after death comes rebirth,” and his final wish was to be reborn a monk. He said the late master’s wishes involved a simple ceremony befitting a regular monk. Hui personally added that while Master Hsing Yun has passed, his teachings remain in the hearts of many people.On Monday, a ceremony was held for monks and lay people in honor of Master Hsing Yun with the incantation of the Heart Sutra. Master Hui Chuan explained that the master's Dharma body will be in the Cloud Dwelling Building for seven consecutive days starting Monday, and open to worshippers from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. every day with a rotation of disciples keeping a vigil 24 hours a day.A final memorial service will be held at Fo Guang Shan at 9:00 a.m. on Feb. 13.",2023/2/6,3734,Opinion

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801708,China-Australia trade ministers hold 1st meeting since 2019,"CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — Australian and Chinese trade ministers held their first bilateral meeting in three years Monday as Australia urges China to lift official and unofficial barriers that are costing exporters 20 billion Australian dollars ($14 billion) a year.

            China has thawed its diplomatic freeze on Australia since Prime Minister Anthony Albanese’s center-left Labor Party was elected in May for the first time in nine years.

            Albanese has urged China to demonstrate good will to his administration by lifting trade restrictions on Australian exports including wine, coal, beef, seafood, barley and wood.











            Trade Minister Don Farrell said that behind closed doors, he and his Chinese counterpart Wang Wentao had agreed to enhance dialogue at all levels as a pathway “towards the timely and full resumption of trade.”

            “Our discussion covered a range of trade and investment issues, including the need for resumption of unimpeded trade for Australian exporters so that Chinese consumers can continue to benefit from high quality Australian products,” Farrell said in a statement after the teleconference meeting from Australia’s Parliament House. 

            During the introductory stage of the meeting that was open to the media, Wang invited Farrell to meet in China.

            “I’m looking forward to open and candid exchanges of views with you,” Wang told Farrell. “I’m also very much happy to extend an invitation to you to visit China at a time convenient to you. And I believe that your next trip to China will leave you with a different impression.”

            Farrell accepted the invitation but did not nominate a date.

            “The outcomes of our discussions have the potential to be of great benefit to both of our countries, and both of our consumers,” Farrell said.

            Wang said the priority of the meeting should be to build mutual trust.

            “I wish to stress we will face up to the issues, but at the same time this meeting cannot resolve all of these issues,” Wang said.

            Although Wang noted that while common ground should be sought, some issues “cannot be resolved.”

            “China will not make a trade-off on principled issues,” Wang said. 

            The trade barriers are widely regarded as punishment for the previous Australian government passing laws that ban covert foreign interference in domestic politics, for barring Chinese-owned telecommunications giant Huawei from rolling out Australia’s 5G network due to security concerns and for calling for an independent investigation of the COVID-19 pandemic.

            Albanese raised his concerns about trade “blockages” in November when he took part in the first formal bilateral meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping by an Australian government leader since 2016.

            Foreign Minister Penny Wong in December became the first Australian foreign minister to visit China in four years. 

            The first shipments of Australian coal to China since Beijing imposed an unofficial ban on the commodity 2 1/2 years ago were due to arrive in the country this week in the first clear sign Xi’s regime will roll back some sanctions on Australian exports, The Australian Financial Review reported.CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — Australian and Chinese trade ministers held their first bilateral meeting in three years Monday as Australia urges China to lift official and unofficial barriers that are costing exporters 20 billion Australian dollars ($14 billion) a year.China has thawed its diplomatic freeze on Australia since Prime Minister Anthony Albanese’s center-left Labor Party was elected in May for the first time in nine years.Albanese has urged China to demonstrate good will to his administration by lifting trade restrictions on Australian exports including wine, coal, beef, seafood, barley and wood.Trade Minister Don Farrell said that behind closed doors, he and his Chinese counterpart Wang Wentao had agreed to enhance dialogue at all levels as a pathway “towards the timely and full resumption of trade.”“Our discussion covered a range of trade and investment issues, including the need for resumption of unimpeded trade for Australian exporters so that Chinese consumers can continue to benefit from high quality Australian products,” Farrell said in a statement after the teleconference meeting from Australia’s Parliament House.During the introductory stage of the meeting that was open to the media, Wang invited Farrell to meet in China.“I’m looking forward to open and candid exchanges of views with you,” Wang told Farrell. “I’m also very much happy to extend an invitation to you to visit China at a time convenient to you.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801710,"In pro-Putin Serbia, liberal-minded Russians seek a home","BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — At a central square in Serbia's capital of Belgrade, dozens of Russians gathered recently to denounce President Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine, holding up photos of political prisoners from their homeland.

            Across the plaza, a billboard touts the Russian propaganda outlet RT, which has launched an online news portal in the country but is banned elsewhere in Europe. Heroic portraits of a bare-chested Putin adorn souvenir T-shirts and coffee mugs, or are painted on city walls.

            These conflicting images reflect the complex and delicate relationship these days between Russia and Serbia.











            The Slavic country is Moscow's closest ally in Europe, with historic, religious and cultural ties that are bolstered by Kremlin political influence campaigns. Russia backs Serbia’s claim over its former province of Kosovo, which declared independence in 2008 with Western support. And Serbia has refused to impose sanctions on Moscow over the invasion.

            At the same time, Serbia wants to join the European Union. Populist President Aleksandar Vucic has denounced the invasion, and about 200,000 Russians have flooded into the country in the past year, with many seeking a new life in a brotherly land free of Kremlin oppression.

            “Here in Belgrade, we are not perceived with hostility, and that means a lot,” said Anastasia Demidova, who arrived in the Balkan nation from Moscow three months ago.

            “I’ve been talking to a lot of Serbian people here and other foreigners. When they ask me ‘what are you doing here,’ I say: ‘We are against Putin and for a democratic Russia and we are against the war in Ukraine, obviously,’” she told The Associated Press.

            Others say they fled to avoid being drafted or because Western sanctions crippled their businesses or took away their jobs.

            As a result, Russian can be heard spoken everywhere in Belgrade, a city of about 2 million. Russian-owned restaurants and bars have sprouted. Private Russian enterprises have mushroomed, especially in the IT sector. The influx has sent the price of real estate soaring.

            This reminds some here of the wave of Russians fleeing the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, and many of those who stayed in Serbia left their mark on its culture and art.

            These modern Russians, however, are maintaining links to their homeland, including financial ties, said historian Aleksej Timofejev. Unlike their predecessors, he said, they can't go onward to the West because of the sanctions and still need visas to travel to richer countries in Europe.

            “They did not choose this country but came here because it is the only one that would have them,” Timofejev added.

            The newcomers say they can still feel Moscow’s heavy-handed influence, especially when it comes to Serbians' approval for Putin, via media outlets like RT.

            Russian activist Petar Nikitin calls it a “coordinated propaganda effort.”

            Nikitin first came to Serbia in the early 2000s. Back then, “this admiration for the Russian government was a lot more marginal ... and I saw it grow exponentially,” he said.

            Russians “who recently arrived, who didn’t know much about Serbia before, yes, many of them told me they were completely shocked to see this idolization specifically of Putin, and this picture of Russia that is completely divorced from reality,” Nikitin said.

            Moscow has boosted this sentiment in the pro-Russia media by feeding Serbian anger with the West over Kosovo following the breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s. The dispute between Serbia and Kosovo has been a source of tension since the war in 1998-99 that ended when a NATO bombing campaign forced Serbia to pull out of the former Serbian province after a bloody crackdown against Kosovo Albanian separatists and civilians

            Serbia's rejection of Kosovo's declaration of independence has Moscow's support — one of the reasons why Belgrade maintains friendly relations with Putin and has refused to join Western sanctions.

            While Vucic has criticized the invasion of Ukraine, he puts a uniquely Balkan spin on it.

            “We do support territorial integrity of Ukraine, as we do support territorial integrity of Serbia,” he told the World Economic Forum in Davos last month. “So … they ask me, ‘Is Crimea part of Ukraine or Russia?’ Yes, it’s part of Ukraine. Donbas is part of Ukraine. If you ask us.""

            His country ""will stick to that, and we will be more loyal to territorial integrity of U.N. member states than many others that changed their stance on territorial integrity of Serbia,” Vucic added, referring to the support for Kosovo's independence from Washington and other countries.

            Western officials have stepped up pressure on Vucic to make a decisive turn away from Moscow if Serbia wants to join the EU. They fear that Russia could stir trouble in the Balkans through its Serbian proxies to avert some of the international attention from Ukraine.

            Recently, the Russian private military contractor Wagner Group ran advertisements on RT's Serbian-language outlet recruiting Serbs to fight in Ukraine. It is illegal for Serbs to take part in conflicts outside the country, although about a dozen joined Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine after battles broke out there in 2014.

            Owned by Putin-linked oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin, Wagner has taken a prominent and active role in Ukraine and also has sent its mercenaries to several African countries. Last month, U.S. State Department Counselor Derek Chollet held talks with Vucic to voice concerns about Wagner’s activities in Serbia.

            Nikitin, the Russian activist who has formed a group called Russian Democratic Community, has teamed up with a Serbian lawyer to file a lawsuit demanding an investigation of the mercenary group. That led to increased threats against more liberal Russians from right-wing Serbian organizations with close links to Wagner and Moscow.

            “The threats that I receive directly and to my inbox are quite carefully worded — they are quite obvious,” Nikitin said. “They range from ‘get out of Serbia’ to very obscene insults involving my family. And veiled threats that I am soon going to meet people who are dead.”

            Nikitin said his more liberal-minded countrymen in Serbia are eager to show they don’t support Putin’s war or his crackdown on opposition groups at home.

            “We want to be very open about who we are and why we hold the views that we hold,” he said.

            Artem, a 33-year-old web developer from St. Petersburg, said that he fled to Serbia with his wife and two pets shortly after the war began on Feb. 24. He spoke with the AP on condition that his last name not be used for “safety reasons.”

            Speaking at a Belgrade bar that's an unofficial hub for more liberal Russians — its Wi-Fi password is “Nowar2402” — he said he's been helping Ukrainian refugees in Serbia through online aid campaigns, providing information on how to start a new life.

            Leaving Russia “was some kind of protest because I didn’t agree at all with the war,” Artem said. “War for me is not an answer for any conflict or anything.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801712,"Pakistan blocks Wikipedia, says it hurt Muslim sentiments","ISLAMABAD (AP) — Pakistan’s media regulator said Monday it blocked Wikipedia services in the country for hurting Muslim sentiment by not removing purportedly blasphemous content from the site. Critics denounced Islamabad’s action, saying it was a blow to digital rights.

            Under Pakistan’s controversial blasphemy laws, anyone found guilty of insulting Islam or its figures can be sentenced to death, although the country has yet to carry out capital punishment for blasphemy. 

            But even allegations of the offense are often enough to provoke mob violence and even deadly attacks. International and domestic rights groups say that accusations of blasphemy have often been used to intimidate religious minorities and settle personal scores.











            The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority says it blocked Wikipedia because a 48-hour deadline to remove the content was ignored, according to a spokesperson. “Such things hurt the sentiments of Muslims,” said Malahat Obaid, from the regulator.

            She said Pakistani authorities were in talks with Wikipedia officials and the ban could be lifted if the platform completely removes anti-Islam content.

            Hours later, Pakistan's Information Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb said that premier Shahbaz Sharif had ordered the immediate restoration of Wikipedia, a move welcomed by Pakistanis.

            The Wikimedia Foundation on Saturday confirmed the ban, saying: “We hope that the Pakistan government joins us in a commitment to knowledge as a human right and restores access to @Wikipedia and Wikimedia projects promptly, so that the people of Pakistan can continue to receive and share knowledge with the world.”

            Mohsin Raza Khan, a Pakistani social media expert, said it is easy to update or replace Wikipedia material deemed sacrilegious or offensive for Muslims — so blocking the site is not the answer.

            “Pakistan’s media regulator and other authorities should try to find some viable technical solution to such problems as blasphemous content is available everywhere,” he said. “It is equal to a drop in the ocean of knowledge.”

            The Lahore-based Digital Rights Foundation earlier called the Wikipedia ban an affront to Pakistanis’ right to access information and a mockery of the country’s commitment to uphold its human rights obligations.

            In the past, Pakistan briefly banned TikTok twice for allegedly uploading “immoral, obscene and vulgar” content.

            But the ban was later lifted after TikTok assured Pakistan it would remove immoral content and also block users who upload “unlawful content.” The app was downloaded millions of times in Pakistan when the ban was imposed in 2020 and 2021.

            Also, in 2008, Pakistan banned YouTube over videos depicting Prophet Muhammad. Muslims generally believe any physical depiction of Islam’s prophet is blasphemous.

            Also on Monday, Amir Mahmood, spokesman for Pakistan’s Ahmadi community, sought protection from the government, saying unidentified Islamists in multiple separate attacks have damaged Ahmadi places of worship in southern Sindh province and elsewhere in the country. 

            “The freedom of worship given to us by the constitution is shrinking,” he told The Associated Press. 

            The attacks, which took place over several days, caused no casualties, Mahmood said.

            The Ahmadi faith was established on the Indian subcontinent in the 19th century by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, whose followers believe he was the messiah that was promised by the Prophet Muhammad. 

            Pakistan’s parliament declared Ahmadis non-Muslims in 1974.

The conclusion is from the think tank’s annual publication on the issue, which was this year named, “Freedom on the Net 2022, Countering an Authoritarian Overhaul of the Internet.”The authors pointed out this status was achieved despite Taiwan facing “a barrage of disinformation that can be traced to China.” They also mentioned private and government initiatives in Taiwan to tackle false information.The top 10 countries for internet freedom were:Other significant findings in the report were, “Global internet freedom declined for the 12th consecutive year,” with the sharpest falls in Russia, Myanmar, Sudan, and Libya. On the other hand, “A record 26 countries experienced internet freedom improvements.”Once again, China did appallingly and ""was the world’s worst environment for internet freedom for the eighth consecutive year.” U.S. internet freedom, meanwhile, “improved marginally for the first time in six years” and was ranked 12th globally.Taiwan’s Overseas Community Affairs Council (OCAC) trumpeted news of the rankings on its Twitter account, adding: “Such a good performance is that Taiwan (Taipei) was received 3rd and 4th globally respectively for Safety/Crime Index by Country 2023 and Safety Index by City 2023!”The OCAC tweet also included a graphic showing off other international awards reflecting the nation’s sterling civic and social achievements.Call me No.1! 〔錯誤字元無法儲存〕Taiwan was awarded Freedom on the Net 2022 at first place in Asia.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801729,Japan's government has sounded out Amamiya about becoming BOJ governor - Nikkei,"TOKYO, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Japan's government has sounded out Bank of Japan (BOJ) Deputy Governor Masayoshi Amamiya to succeed incumbent Haruhiko Kuroda as central bank governor, the Nikkei newspaper reported early on Monday, citing anonymous government and ruling party sources.
Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, who has authority to choose the next BOJ governor, told reporters later on Monday he would continue to consider the best candidate for the job, suggesting that no final decision had been made.
The next BOJ chief will face the delicate task of normalising ultra-loose monetary policy, which is drawing increasing public criticism for distorting market function.
A career central banker who has drafted many of the BOJ's monetary easing tools, Amamiya has been seen by markets as a top contender to take over as next governor.
Kishida's administration is in the final stages of deciding on successors to Kuroda and two deputy governors and is in discussions with the ruling coalition about the process, the Nikkei said.
The government's nominations will be presented to parliament later this month and take effect upon both houses granting approval, which is effectively a done deal since the ruling coalition has a solid majority.
The Nikkei report did not say whether Amamiya had accepted the offer. When asked about the Nikkei report, Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki told reporters he had not heard that the government had offered Amamiya the job.
Jiji news agency said Amamiya had not commented to reporters when asked whether he had been sounded out about becoming BOJ governor.
In a news conference on Monday, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihiko Isozaki said there was no truth to the report the government had sounded out Amamiya for the top BOJ job.
Kishida's choice of a successor to Kuroda, whose five-year term will end on April 8, will likely affect how soon the central bank could phase out its massive stimulus. Inflation hit 4% in December, double the BOJ's 2% target.
The dollar rose as high as 132.60 yen after the Nikkei report, topping the 132-level for the first time since Jan. 12, as Amamiya is seen by markets as more dovish than other contenders for the post. It gave up some gains after the remarks by Kishida and Isozaki and was last up 0.5% at 131.84 yen.
If Amamiya did become governor, his appointment would frustrate investors who are long on the yen and hoping for someone more hawkish, such as former deputy governor Hirohide Yamaguchi, to get the job, said Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone.
""Amamiya, if (he) accepts, will have full reign on policy changes and the idea of policy continuation is true here,"" he said, adding that investors whose base case was for the BOJ to tweak its yield control policy in late April would now be reviewing that call.
Amamiya played a key role in drafting Kuroda's asset-buying programme in 2013 and consistently called for keeping ultra-low interest rates. But he also said in July the BOJ must ""always"" think about the means of exiting ultra-loose monetary policy.
Amamiya and Masazumi Wakatabe are currently serving as deputy governors, but their five-year terms end on March 19.
With inflation exceeding its 2% target, markets are rife with speculation the BOJ will start raising interest rates under the successor of dovish Kuroda.
Critics of the BOJ's ultra-loose policy warn of the rising cost of prolonged easing, such as market distortions caused by the bank's relentless defence of its yield cap.
A task force of the opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan on Friday issued a proposal calling on the BOJ to abandon its yield control policy, and target achievement of wage growth that exceeds the pace of inflation.TOKYO, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Japan's government has sounded out Bank of Japan (BOJ) Deputy Governor Masayoshi Amamiya to succeed incumbent Haruhiko Kuroda as central bank governor, the Nikkei newspaper reported early on Monday, citing anonymous government and ruling party sources.Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, who has authority to choose the next BOJ governor, told reporters later on Monday he would continue to consider the best candidate for the job, suggesting that no final decision had been made.The next BOJ chief will face the delicate task of normalising ultra-loose monetary policy, which is drawing increasing public criticism for distorting market function.A career central banker who has drafted many of the BOJ's monetary easing tools, Amamiya has been seen by markets as a top contender to take over as next governor.Kishida's administration is in the final stages of deciding on successors to Kuroda and two deputy governors and is in discussions with the ruling coalition about the process, the Nikkei said.The government's nominations will be presented to parliament later this month and take effect upon both houses granting approval, which is effectively a done deal since the ruling coalition has a solid majority.The Nikkei report did not say whether Amamiya had accepted the offer.

            He established Fo Guang Shan monastery in 1967, aiming to propagate Buddhist humanitarian values. It would go on to operate hundreds of temples and seminaries around the world, along with universities in Taiwan, Australia, the U.S. and the Philippines.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801731,Iran singer who faces prison wins Grammy for protest anthem,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — An Iranian singer who faces possible prison time for his song that's become an anthem to the ongoing protests shaking the Islamic Republic wept early Monday after seeing he'd won a Grammy. 

            Shervin Hajipour appeared stunned after hearing Jill Biden, the wife of President Joe Biden, announce he'd won the Grammy's new song for social change special merit award for “Baraye.” An online video showed Hajipour in a darkened room, wiping tears away after the announcement. 

            Hajipour's song “Baraye,” or “For” in English, begins with: “For dancing in the streets,” “for the fear we feel when we kiss.” The lyrics list reasons young Iranians have posted on Twitter for why they had protested against Iran's ruling theocracy.











            It ends with the widely chanted slogan that has become synonymous with the protests since the September death of Iranian-Kurdish woman Masha Amini: “For women, life, freedom.” 

            Released on his Instagram page, the song quickly went viral. Hajipour then was arrested and held for several days before being released on bail in October. The 25-year-old singer faces charges of “propaganda against the regime” and “instigating the violence,” according to Human Rights Activists in Iran, a group that's been monitoring the monthslong protests. 

            The charges Hajipour faces can carry as much as six years in prison all together. The singer is also banned from leaving Iran. 

            Wearing a shining, off-the-shoulder Oscar de la Renta dress at the Grammy ceremony in Los Angeles, Biden said that a song “can unite, inspire and ultimately change the world.” 

            “This song became the anthem of the Mahsa Amini protests, a powerful and poetic call for freedom and women's rights,” Biden said. “Shervin was arrested, but this song continues to resonate around the world with its powerful theme: Women, life, freedom.""

            Those gathered cheered Biden's remarks. On Instagram, Hajipour simply wrote: “We won.” 

            There was no immediate reaction in Iranian state media or from government officials to Hajipour’s win. The singer is among over 19,600 people arrested amid the demonstrations, according to Human Rights Activists in Iran. At least 527 people have been killed amid a violent suppression of the demonstration by authorities.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801771,Kosovo PM calls on West not to put pressure over Serb entity,"PRISTINA, Kosovo (AP) — Kosovar Prime Minister Albin Kurti has called on Western powers not to pressure his tiny Balkan country into accepting a contentious association of five Serb-majority municipalities that is ramping up tensions between Kosovo and Serbia.

            Kurti told The Associated Press that the focus instead should be on making Serbia more democratic and getting rid of what he called Belgrade's hopes of regional leadership.

            Kurti said in the interview on Sunday that the Serbian government should acknowledge Kosovo's independence in order to “face the past.” He also stressed that Belgrade should lean more toward the European Union and NATO than to Russia.











            The prime minister said that if Belgrade abandons the idea that Kosovo still belongs to Serbia, “they will be much more democratic, European.”

            The dispute between Serbia and its former province of Kosovo has remained a source of instability in the Balkans long after the 1998-99 war, which ended with a NATO intervention that forced Serbia to pull out of the territory.

            Kosovo in 2008 declared independence from Serbia, which Belgrade has refused to recognize, supported by Russia and China. The U.S. and most EU nations have recognized Kosovo.

            In recent weeks, U.S. and EU envoys have visited Pristina and Belgrade to encourage them to accept a new proposal to normalize relations and boost their EU accession bids.

            A EU-mediated Kosovo-Serbia dialogue has been ongoing since 2011, but few of the 33 signed agreements have been implemented. 

            Kurti said of the negotiations so far that “every solution became ever more complicated, ever less implementable, and the public lost interest.” He considered the new proposal “a good framework and platform for moving forward … which makes us hopeful about the prospects of future talks and an agreement.”

            The proposal’s details haven't yet been made public. 

            U.S. Ambassador to Pristina Jeffrey M. Hovenier told the Associated Press that the proposal “is an interim step, that ... would regularize relations in very meaningful ways and be of enormous benefit both to Kosovo and Serbia.”

            “It is in both countries’ interests to get themselves into a different place in their relationship with one another,” he said.

            The United States has increased pressure on Pristina to implement a 2013 agreement to establish the Association of Serb-Majority Municipalities in ethnic-Serb dominated northern Kosovo, which would coordinate work on education, health care, land planning and economic development at the local level. In 2015, Kosovo’s Constitutional Court declared part of the plan unconstitutional as it wasn’t inclusive of other ethnicities and could entail the use of executive powers.

            Kurti says the establishment of the association isn't his priority, and last week he set conditions saying it can only be formed as part of an overall agreement on the normalization of relations, which Serbia has rejected in the past. Kosovo authorities fear it would eventually undermine the country’s statehood with the help of Belgrade. 

            Western powers should learn from the example of Bosnia's Serb-run ministate Republica Srpska, fearing the creation of a ministate in Kosovo, he said, adding that Belgrade used the creation of the association “as a weapon against our independence.”

            “If we introduce in the Western Balkans the idea of ethnically based association of municipalities, that’s a recipe for new conflicts,” Kurti said.

            Western powers should not impose pressure on smaller countries like Kosovo, he said. The problems between Kosovo and Serbia might be small and annoying, but the West should pay attention to what has been going on in the region because “any kind of wrong solution in the Balkans can and will be used elsewhere.”

            The situation remains tense in northern Kosovo after Western powers helped resolve a tense situation in December when Serbs erected barricades on main roads to protest the arrest of a former Serb police officer.

            Lars-Gunnar Wigemark, head of the EU’s rule of law mission in Kosovo, called the incident a “very tense standoff with barricades” and “the most serious crisis facing Kosovo … for the past decade.”

            Another senior Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue, said that mediators are “working very hard” to avoid anything that could provoke demonstrations or violence.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801788,Taiwan battles leaks of personal information in ride sharing apps,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A data breach is threatening yet another car rental agency in Taiwan, drawing the attention of politicians and help from government authorities tasked with protecting citizens’ personal data.New Power Party Legislator Chiu Hsien-chih (邱顯智) and technology engineer Wang Jing-hong (王景弘) held a press conference at the legislature where they questioned Car-Plus Rental about their cloud storage security, warning that it was unsafe and could potentially reveal member data and order information to third parties, per CNA.In response, Car-Plus issued a press release on Monday (Feb. 6) noting that it had closed its Go Smart app on Feb. 2, one hour after it learned of the potential breach of information, they immediately checked the database and found no abnormal queries or downloads. While it found no irregularities, it did take the necessary steps and notified all 16,000 users registered with the app on Feb. 3 of the potential breach.At present, the company uses encryption protection and has taken extra measures to ensure there is no disclosure of the personal information of its users. The company added that it takes the safety of personal data seriously and has strengthened relevant database safety in accordance with ISO-27001 information security verification, which includes regular scanning and high-strength firewall mechanisms.Legislators Chiu Hsien-chih and Wang Jing-hong warned Car-Plus user information was at risk, with information related to some 100,000 transactions potentially leaked, and they called on the government to set up an organization as soon as possible to ensure the security of the personal data of all citizens.Wang explained that following the personal data leak associated with iRent, operated by Hotai, last week, yet another car rental service was at risk. He alleged that the mainframe server host does not implement proper identity verification, and cloud storage is not properly configured so all members' order information can be queried, including member name, date of birth, and ID card number.Wang said that according to a current security test, there are more than 100,000 PDF order data files that do not have any access restrictions, potentially putting more than 16,000 users at risk.To compensate, iRent will prepare a compensation package for 400,000 at-risk clients from the recent leak, according to reports on Saturday (Feb. 4). Reports emerged that the data included names and addresses as well as information about driver’s licenses and payment details.The number of users estimated to be affected by the data leaks over the past three months is thought to be 140,000, per UDN.Regarding the recent breach of personal information, Ministry of Digital Affairs (MODA), Deputy Minister Lee Huai-jen (李懷仁) said in a press release that according to the Personal Data Protection Law, personal data is under the supervision of the relevant authorities and suspected leakage or any information security incident can be immediately reported to the Taiwan Network Information Center (TWNIC), a consortium supervised by MODA.Li pointed out the promotion of Zero Trust Architecture and a unified transmission standard (T-Road) can also contribute to improving data security.As for private information security, the ministry has convened a meeting of e-commerce operators, with the potential to roll out strict requirements to monitor information security while at the same time subsidizing media information security operators to assist e-commerce operators to detect defects and seek improvements.MODA emphasized that in addition to the government's efforts to protect information security and personal data, it also requires the efforts of private organizations and everyone to work together to improve protection capabilities.",2023/2/6,1146,Business

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801799,"Grammys Moments: A rap tribute for the ages, Beyoncé triumph","As he accepted an innovator's award named for him, Dr. Dre mused about what he had in common with many of the people he saw from the Grammy Awards stage.

            “Where would a lot of people in here be without hip-hop?” the r enowned rapper, producer and entrepreneur said.

            The 2023 Grammy Awards may ultimately be remembered as the year the music industry's top event tried to embrace rap, whose leaders have regarded the institution with suspicion for almost as long as the 50 years of history that were celebrated on Sunday.











            It was only four years ago that song of the year winner Childish Gambino boycotted the show over perceived disrespect for rap. Kanye West and Eminem were among past stars with groundbreaking work overlooked for more middling fare and, for years, rappers complained their work was banished from TV.

            The 15-minute Questlove-curated travel through time was a joy that brought dozens of stars to the stage, including Grandmaster Flash & the Furious Five, Run-DMC, Public Enemy, Ice T, Missy Elliott, Queen Latifah, Method Man, Salt-N-Pepa ... the list goes on, and still there were those you wished were there.

            Nearly as important was the eight-minute version of DJ Khaled's “God Did” that closed the show — Khaled took public note of the length — that featured a spellbinding appearance by Jay-Z.

            Quavo's tribute to Takeoff of Migos was arguably the highlight of a packed and memorable “in memoriam” segment to artists who died over the past year.

            Kendrick Lamar gave an incisive acceptance speech after “Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers” won a Grammy for best rap album, his third trophy in this category.

            It was a night it seemed the Grammys finally accepted rap as music's dominant form. Will rappers finally accept the Grammys? That remains to be seen.

            QUEEN BEY'S HAUL

            Beyoncé took a place in history on Sunday when her four Grammys gave her a career total of 32, better than anyone else.

            And yet...

            The Grammys have a clear pecking order, with four of its awards the most prestigious: song, record and album of the year, and best new artist. Beyoncé has won only one of those awards, when “Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)” was named top song in 2010. 

            She's been nominated eight times for record of the year, and never won. Her most memorable Grammy moments came when two peers stood onstage with their own trophies and saluted her: when A dele said Beyonce's “Lemonade” should have won instead of her in 2017, and Sunday when Lizzo spoke of skipping school in fifth grade to see Beyoncé perform.

            Thirty-two trophies. It's still hard to shake an empty feeling.

            TRIVIA QUESTION

            Whose record did Beyoncé beat? That would be classical conductor Georg Solti.

            RAITT'S TRIUMPH

            It may take Bonnie Raitt a few days to lose that look of shock. The 73-year-old guitarist won best song for “Just Like That,” a piece inspired by a story of a heart transplant, where she tried to emulate the writing style of the late John Prine. It was especially gratifying because Raitt is more of an interpreter. “I don't write a lot of songs, but I'm proud that you appreciate this one,” she said. It was 33 years after “Nick of Time” was named album of the year.

            NOAH'S NIGHT

            
                Show host Trevor Noah skillfully played the role of a fan, instead of serving snark from the stage, moving through the audience “like a floating Chinese balloon,” he said. And why not? With Adele, Lizzo, Beyoncé, Taylor Swift, Harry Styles and the like around, there was plenty of star power. Noah was neither insulting nor obsequious. And one delightful device — having fans talk about their favorite albums — paid off when a memorable grandma got to announce Styles' album of the year win.

            HARRY'S STYLE

            OK, while he was performing “As it Was” Styles was dressed a little like one of those holiday tinsel decorations you thought you'd put away. The smooth pop composition clearly served him well. Later, he marveled at the quality of the competition and how hard it is to pick a winner. “You never know with this stuff,” he said backstage. “I don't think you can look at any of the nominees and not feel as if they're deserving. I'm really grateful they chose us.”

            PETRAS' MOMENT

            In accepting a Grammy for her duet on Sam Smith's “Unholy,” Kim Petras proudly took note of her status as a transgender woman and paid tribute to heroes like the late transgender singer Sophie and Madonna. The latter returned the favor by introducing a performance of the song. Petras and Lizzo, who won record of the year for “About Damn Time,” made strong, joyful statements about accepting differences. “I felt on the outside looking in and I stayed true to myself because I wanted to make the world a better place,” Lizzo said.

            INTRODUCING...

            One element that worked less well was an effort to have family or friends introduce performances. You lose the idea of “real people” when Madonna is one of the choices. The best was the first — Catherine Shepherd, the proud wife, and the two children of Brandi Carlile (the kids also debuted in a hotel ad). “I'm a very, very lucky queer,” Carlile said backstage.

            WHY AM I HERE?

            The Rock as one of the Grammy presenters? Jill Biden? James Corden? At least the outgoing talk show host noted the incongruity of him giving an award for dance and electronic music. There's enough musical firepower in the room that would surely relish the opportunity to present an award. And while we're asking why someone was there, Ben Affleck turned himself into an unwanted internet star when the camera panned to him in the audience and it seemed like he'd rather be anywhere else. Don't actors know how to fake looking like they're having a good time?

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801817,'Loophole' excuses WHO officials accused of misconduct,"LONDON (AP) — A confidential U.N. report into alleged missteps by senior World Health Organization staffers in the way they handled a sexual misconduct case during an Ebola outbreak in Congo found their response didn't violate the agency’s policies because of what some officials described as a “loophole” in how the WHO defines victims of such behavior.

            The report, which was submitted to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus last month and wasn't released publicly, was obtained by The Associated Press. The WHO did not respond to requests for comment.

            The U.N. investigation comes after a 2021 review by a panel appointed by Tedros found that three WHO managers fumbled a sexual misconduct case first reported by the AP earlier that year, involving a U.N. health agency doctor signing a contract to buy land for a young woman he reportedly impregnated.











            
                Last week, Tedros said U.N. investigators concluded the “managerial misconduct” charges were unsubstantiated and the three staffers returned to work after being on administrative leave. The WHO chief said the agency would seek advice from experts on how to handle the inconsistencies between the two reports.

            The investigators said Tedros was informed of the sexual misconduct allegations in 2019 and had been warned of worrying gaps in the WHO’s misconduct policies the previous year.

            “If these issues were brought to Tedros’ attention and no action was taken, (WHO) member states must demand accountability,” said Dr. Irwin Redlener, a global health expert at Columbia University.

            Tedros has previously said he became aware of sexual misconduct complaints in Congo only after media reports in September 2020 and learned of the specific case reported by the AP when it was published. He said anyone connected to sexual misconduct faced consequences including dismissal. To date, no senior WHO staffers linked to the abuse and exploitation have been fired.

            In May 2021, an AP investigation revealed senior WHO management was told of sexual exploitation during the agency’s efforts to stop Ebola in eastern Congo from 2018-2020 but did little to stop it.

            Among the cases WHO management were warned about was the allegation that Dr. Jean-Paul Ngandu, an infection control specialist sent to Beni, had impregnated a young woman. Ngandu met the woman at a restaurant one evening shortly after he arrived - and following mandatory WHO training on the prevention of sexual misconduct. 

            According to the U.N. report, the two had sex later that evening and Ngandu gave her some money the next morning. The relationship soured and the woman and her aunt later went to the WHO office in Beni to complain that Ngandu had impregnated her. AP obtained a notarized agreement Ngandu and the woman, in which he agreed to cover her health care costs and buy her land. 

            The deal, also signed by two WHO staffers, was meant to protect the WHO’s reputation, Ngandu said. 

            “After the allegations were made to WHO (headquarters), a decision was made not to investigate the complaint on the basis that it did not violate WHO’s (sexual exploitation and abuse) policy framework,” the U.N. report said.

            The review explained that the decision was made by officials from the U.N. health agency’s legal, ethics and other departments and was due to the fact that the woman wasn't a “beneficiary” of WHO assistance, meaning she didn't receive any emergency or humanitarian aid from the agency, and thus, didn't qualify as a victim under WHO policy.

            WHO staffers interviewed by U.N. investigators said this might be considered a “loophole which had the potential to cause complaints to fall through the cracks.”

            “Ngandu’s conduct did not violate any WHO (sexual exploitation and abuse) standards of conduct,” the report said, describing his agreement to pay off the woman as a “private financial settlement.”

            U.N. investigators noted there were problems in the WHO’s sexual misconduct policies, describing those as “a collective responsibility.” In February 2018, several staffers sent a memorandum to Tedros warning of the policies’ shortcomings.

            Experts slammed WHO’s defense, saying the agency should uphold the highest standards in handling sexual exploitation since it coordinates global responses to acute crises like COVID-19 and monkeypox.

            “Escaping accountability based on weasel words and technical language, like not being a ‘beneficiary’ of WHO assistance is unacceptable,” said Larry Gostin, director of the WHO Collaborating Centre on Public Health Law and Human Rights at Georgetown University. “That the U.N. Office of Internal Oversight Services excused this behaviour based on this legal technicality shows the U.N. and WHO are not taking sexual abuse seriously.”

            After the reports of sexual misconduct in Congo arose, the WHO created a new office to prevent such behavior, headed by Dr. Gaya Gamhewage. In her interview with U.N. investigators, Gamhewage said that prior to starting her new job, she had no knowledge of the WHO’s sexual misconduct policies and had not even read them.

            “Sexual exploitation and abuse were not familiar terms to her,” the report said.

            The U.N. investigation comes weeks after the AP published another story detailing sexual misconduct at the WHO, involving a Fijian doctor with a history of sexual assault allegations within the agency, who was preparing to run in an election for the WHO’s top director in the Western Pacific. 

            “These repeated instances of sexual assault, and arguably worse, its cover-up, are grossly intolerable,” said Columbia University’s Redlener. “It’s possible this Ngandu case didn’t technically break WHO’s policy, but there is policy and then there is morality and ethics,” he said. “There’s something deeply uncomfortable about what happened here.”

            During the Ebola epidemic, Tedros travelled to Congo 14 times to personally oversee the WHO’s response.

            “At a minimum, Tedros should promise and deliver a major overhaul on policies and accountability,” Redlener said. “There might even be an expectation that he failed in his responsibilities and should therefore resign.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801818,Adani woes spur protests as stock turmoil turns political,"NEW DELHI (AP) — Hundreds of demonstrators from India's main opposition party turned out Monday in India's capital New Delhi and other cities demanding an investigation into allegations of fraud and stock price manipulation by India’s second-biggest business group, headed by coal mining tycoon Gautam Adani. 

            The Adani Group said Monday that its major investors, known in India as “promoters,"" had pledged to prepay $1.1 billion in share-backed loans due for repayment by September 2024. The repayments include shares in Adani's ports business, Adani Green Energy and Adani Transmission.

            Shares in Adani Ports & Special Economic Zone jumped 9% after the announcement. 











            Members of the opposition Congress party have been urging Prime Minister Narendra Modi to order an investigation into Adani Group companies after a U.S.-based short-selling firm, Hindenburg Research, accused them of various fraudulent practices. The Adani group has denied any wrongdoing. 

            In New Delhi, Congress Party workers threw fake currency notes in the air and chanted slogans. Some burnt a suitcase plastered with images of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Adani. Some protesters scaled police barricades and were detained and taken away in police vans. 

            Opposition party workers in the financial capital, Mumbai, and in the southern city of Chennai gathered outside the offices of a state-run bank and the country's largest insurer, which known to have investments in Adani shares. 

            So far, there is no sign the fracas was spreading across India’s financial sector and the protests are more a reflection of political theater rather than spontaneous public outrage. Lawmakers disrupted Parliament proceedings for a third day on Monday as calls mounted for India’s market regulator to look into Hindenburg’s claims. 

            Adani and his companies have lost tens of billions of dollars as investors dumped their shares. Last week, the Adani Group cancelled a $2.5 billion share offering, promising to provide refunds to investors.

            The billionaire's fortune had swelled by more than 2,000% in recent years. Critics say he has benefited from strong relationships with Modi and his government, while others point out he also prospered under previous administrations. 

            “What action has been taken, if ever, to investigate the serious allegations made over the years against the Adani Group?” Jairam Ramesh, the Congress Party’s general secretary, said in a statement issued over the weekend. “Is there any hope of a fair and impartial investigation under you?” he said in a reference to Modi. 

            Shares in Adani Enterprises, the group's flagship, wobbled Monday and were down 2.1% by mid-afternoon Monday. Its market value has shrunk by more than 50% since the Hindenburg report. Stock in five other Adani listed companies fell 5% to 10%. 

            The move by Adani to repay share-backed borrowing early addressed one of the key concerns raised by Hindenburg: heavy borrowing using group shares as collateral. Adani said in a written statement that the pledge by major shareholders to repay that debt was “in continuation of promoter's assurance to prepay all share-backed financing.""

            The wild swings in share prices have highlighted concerns over corporate governance, especially as the country tries to woo foreign investors.

            On Saturday, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) issued a rare statement seeking to calm investors. 

            “During the past week, unusual price movement in the stocks of a business conglomerate has been observed,” India’s market regulator said, without naming the Adani Group. It said mechanisms were in place to deal with volatility in specific stocks. The SEBI would examine any information before taking “appropriate action,"" it said. 

            Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Friday dismissed concerns the controversy would alarm global investors, saying India's financial markets are “very well regulated”. 

            Hindenburg's report said it was betting against the seven main publicly listed Adani companies, judging them to have an “85% downside, purely on a fundamental basis owing to sky-high valuations.” 

            Adani built a fortune in trading and in coal mining and then branched into construction, power generation, operation of ports and airports, manufacturing defense equipment and running a media company. 

            Before the latest troubles, Bloomberg's Billionaire Index listed Adani as Asia's richest person and the world's third wealthiest. Bloomberg's rankings now put him at 21st wealthiest after his net worth sank to $59 billion from $120 billion.NEW DELHI (AP) — Hundreds of demonstrators from India's main opposition party turned out Monday in India's capital New Delhi and other cities demanding an investigation into allegations of fraud and stock price manipulation by India’s second-biggest business group, headed by coal mining tycoon Gautam Adani.The Adani Group said Monday that its major investors, known in India as “promoters,"" had pledged to prepay $1.1 billion in share-backed loans due for repayment by September 2024.

            The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, which took place on Sunday.

            Pakistan has been battling an insurgency in Baluchistan for more than a decade, with separatists in the province demanding complete autonomy or a larger share of the province’s gas and mineral resources. 











            The outlawed Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan — or TTP as the Pakistani Taliban are known — and other militants also have a presence in the province, which borders Iran and Afghanistan.

            Sunday's bombing took place near the Musa Khan checkpoint in Quetta, the Baluchistan provincial capital, said local police official Mohammad Khan. He provided no further details.

            Shortly after the bombing, the Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility, saying the attack was carried out by a suicide bomber. Police and security officials have not given confirmed the source of the blast.

            The latest incident comes a week after a suicide bomber killed 101 people at a mosque in the northwestern city of Peshawar, drawing nationwide condemnation and prompting Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif to convene a meeting of opposition politicians and his allies to discuss how to respond to the surge in militant violence.

            The conference was initially planned for Tuesday, but has been pushed back to Thursday.

            Pakistani officials have blamed the TTP, which maintains sanctuaries in neighboring Afghanistan, for orchestrating the Peshawar bombing. The TTP has denied involvement. The militant group, however, has stepped up its attacks since November, when it ended a cease-fire with the government in Islamabad.

            Sharif has invited his predecessor and opposition leader Imran Khan to Thursday’s talks, but Khan has yet to confirm his participation.

            Since the Peshawar attack, members of civil society groups have staged rallies across the country, holding prayer ceremonies for the victims and demanding government take action to curb the surge in militant attacks.QUETTA, Pakistan (AP) — A bombing near a vehicle carrying Pakistani paramilitary troops in southwestern Baluchistan province killed a soldier and wounded 11 people, mostly civilians, police and security officials said Monday.The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, which took place on Sunday.Pakistan has been battling an insurgency in Baluchistan for more than a decade, with separatists in the province demanding complete autonomy or a larger share of the province’s gas and mineral resources.The outlawed Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan — or TTP as the Pakistani Taliban are known — and other militants also have a presence in the province, which borders Iran and Afghanistan.Sunday's bombing took place near the Musa Khan checkpoint in Quetta, the Baluchistan provincial capital, said local police official Mohammad Khan.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801843,"UK nurses, ambulance crews strike, straining health system","LONDON (AP) — Tens of thousands of nurses and ambulance staff walked off the job in the U.K. on Monday in what unions called the biggest strike in the history of the country's public health system.

            The walkout is the latest in a wave of strikes that has disrupted Britons’ lives for months, as workers — especially in the public sector — demand pay raises to keep pace with double-digit inflation. Teachers, train drivers, airport baggage handlers, border staff, driving instructors, bus drivers and postal workers also have all walked off their jobs in recent months to demand higher pay.

            Teachers, health workers and many others say their wages have fallen in real terms over the last decade, and a cost-of-living crisis fueled by sharply rising food and energy prices has left many struggling to pay their bills.











            Victoria Busk, a trainee nursing associate at a trauma center in Birmingham, central England, said hospitals were understaffed and nurses “run off our feet 24/7.”

            “We need people to want to come into"" the profession, she said. “The only way that we’re going to get that is by raising wages and make sure it is something that people want to do.”

            Britain's annual inflation rate was 10.5% in December, a 41-year high. The Conservative government argues that giving public sector staff pay increases of 10% or more would drive inflation even higher. 

            The strike piles more pressure on the state-funded National Health Service, already staggering under demand from winter viruses, staff shortages and backlogs built up during the COVID-19 pandemic.

            Nursing unions say emergency care and cancer treatment will continue during their 48-hour walkout, but thousands of appointments and procedures are likely to be postponed. 

            The ambulance service says it will respond to the most urgent calls during a daylong strike. But Business Secretary Grant Shapps said the strike could put lives at risk, leaving people with “a postcode lottery when it comes to having a heart attack or a stroke.”

            Sharon Graham, general secretary of the Unite union representing some ambulance staff, said Sunday there were “no talks at any level whatsoever with the government” about pay. She urged Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to “come to the table and negotiate — roll your sleeves up and negotiate on the pay in the NHS — that is what’s required.""

            Pat Cullen, head of the Royal College of Nursing union, also said a “meaningful” pay offer from the government could bring the strike “to a swift close.”

            Sunak's spokesman, Max Blain, said Monday that there was no plan for the prime minister to get directly involved in talks, but “we want to keep discussing how we can find a path forward with the unions.”

            Unions are seeking a pay raise for the current year, but the government says it will only talk about the year ahead. 

            Monday’s nursing strike affects England. In Scotland and Wales — which have semiautonomous governments in charge of health policy — unions have suspended walkouts while negotiations continue.

            Sunak’s government also has angered unions by introducing a bill that will make it harder for key workers to strike by setting ”minimum safety levels” for firefighters, ambulance services and railways that must be maintained during a walkout.LONDON (AP) — Tens of thousands of nurses and ambulance staff walked off the job in the U.K. on Monday in what unions called the biggest strike in the history of the country's public health system.The walkout is the latest in a wave of strikes that has disrupted Britons’ lives for months, as workers — especially in the public sector — demand pay raises to keep pace with double-digit inflation.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801844,"Renault, Nissan reboot auto alliance for post-Ghosn era","LONDON (AP) — Automakers Renault and Nissan on Monday formalized their reboot of a relationship that had grown rocky, culminating in the spectacular fall of top executive Carlos Ghosn, who had led successful turnarounds at both companies before his arrest and daring escape.

            The boards of both companies approved equalizing the stake each automaker holds in the other to 15%, bringing a better balance in the French-Japanese alliance, which also includes smaller Japanese carmaker Mitsubishi Motors Corp. The uneven shareholdings had been viewed at times as a source of conflict. 

            Until now, Renault Group of France owned 43.4% of Nissan Motor Co., while the Japanese automaker owned 15% of Renault.











            “We have been waiting a long time for this moment,” Renault board Chairman Jean Dominique Senard said at a news conference in London, calling it a “new era."" 

            Nissan intends to invest up to 15% in Ampere, Renault’s electric vehicle and software entity in Europe that Mitsubishi also will consider investing in. The automakers said they will collaborate in markets worldwide, including Latin America, Europe and India.

            The moves come at a time when the extremely competitive auto industry is undergoing a major shift toward electric vehicles and other environmentally friendly models. 

            The long speculated changes to the carmaker alliance were announced a week ago. Shares equivalent to a 28.4% stake will be transferred to a French trust, according to the companies. 

            Renault, whose top shareholder is the French government, and Nissan agreed on an orderly sale of that stake, although there will be no deadline.

            Nissan Chief Executive Makoto Uchida vowed to take the alliance to “the next level of transformation” to adapt to a new era. 

            “This is not a choice but a need,” he said. 

            In theory, partnerships are a good way for automakers to cut costs by sharing parts, production and technology, especially when the industry is going through such dramatic change with EVs. 

            That also means that, once formed, ending an alliance can be difficult because the companies’ development, manufacturing and products get so closely tied together. 

            Still, partnerships can stumble because of the different corporate cultures of the automakers, especially when it involves a meeting of the West and East.

            The Renault-Nissan alliance, which started in 1999, was plunged into scandal when Ghosn, the executive sent by Renault to lead a turnaround at the then-near-bankrupt Nissan, was arrested in Japan in 2018 on financial misconduct charges. 

            Ghosn, who says he is innocent, jumped bail in a daring escape by hiding in a box spirited aboard a private jet and now lives in Lebanon, which has no extradition treaty with Japan. Renault and Nissan have been distancing themselves from the Ghosn scandal.

            In an interview with The Associated Press, Senard emphasized that Renault is decidedly in the post-Ghosn era. 

            “That is in the past. I mean, nobody in Renault today is talking about that subject,"" he said, without mentioning Ghosn’s name. “They’re all concentrated, honestly, on the future, on what we’re doing.”

            With its Ampere project, Renault is scrambling to beef up its electric car lineup like other automakers, adding to an increasingly competitive field long dominated by Tesla. Senard said he's confident about the French automaker's chances. 

            “You look at the new cars that are coming out from the Renault plants today. They’re just beautiful,"" he said. “I mean, they have nothing to be jealous about when they look at Tesla and these other guys.” 

            The Renault chairman acknowledged that Chinese electric car brands exporting to Europe have a “strong cost advantage"" but that gives the French automaker extra incentive to compete. 

            “It’s a bet, but as you understand, we have decided to win that bet,” he said.

            Executives at the news conference, including Renault CEO Luca de Meo, stressed that collaborations, cost cuts, model offerings and sales will grow, noting the companies’ relationship will look toward the future and become “normal.”

            Senard appeared to acknowledge the bumps along the way when he noted hopes that past misunderstandings will be fixed. 

            “These frustrations are behind us,” he told reporters. 

            Renault left the Russian market last year after the invasion of Ukraine, selling its majority stake in Avtovaz, a Russian car company best known for its Lada brand, and its Moscow factory for a symbolic single ruble. 

            Senard told the AP that the door is still open for the company to return. 

            “If one day we thought it made sense to come back in Russia in one form or another, that means that many things would have changed. If that happens, why not?"" he said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801883,Hong Kong transgender men win appeal over status change,"HONG KONG (AP) — Hong Kong’s top court ruled Monday that full sex reassignment surgery should not be a prerequisite for transgender people to have their gender changed on their official identity cards, in a move that is likely to have a far-reaching impact on the transgender community.

            A transgender activist, Henry Edward Tse, and a person identified only as Q appealed to the court last month over the government’s refusal to change the genders on their ID cards because of their decision not to have full sex reassignment surgeries.

            Tse and Q are both transgender men who have had their breasts removed, received hormonal treatments and lived their lives as males with professional support and guidance as well as psychiatric treatment.











            The judgment by the Court of Final Appeal is expected to have a wide impact on the LGBTQ community because many of its transgender members consider having the operation unnecessary and risky.

            The two went to court because existing government policy only allows transgender men to change their official gender if they have removed their uteruses and ovaries and constructed male genitalia. Only those who cannot undergo the surgical procedures due to medical reasons can be exempted.

            Both the Court of First Instance and the Court of Appeal dismissed judicial review proceedings brought by Tse and Q. The two were allowed to go to the Court of Final Appeal.

            In a judgment made public Monday, the court said the government's policy was unconstitutional and imposed an “unacceptably harsh burden.” They also said that the policy was “disproportionate"" in its encroachment upon the rights of the two to gender identity and physical integrity.

            The judges also said any administrative issues that usually arise tend to pertain to a transgender person's outward appearance and not the appearance of their genital area, and that leaving the gender on their identity card unamended “produced greater confusion or embarrassment.""

            Tse welcomed the ruling, saying many transgender people have been longing for a “final victory” for years. 

            “Now I have a male ID card, it will be a lot easier for me to access gender-segregated spaces,” he said. “I wouldn’t be questioned and humiliated by being outed by my ID that’s incongruent to who I am.” 

            Liam Mak, co-founder and chairperson of local transgender youth organization Quarks, described the win as an “important milestone” for the transgender community in Hong Kong.

            “We believe that the gender identity of oneself should not be tied to medical intervention, we should ensure minimal to no medical intervention in the policy,” said Mak. “Given that every individual has different preferences or decisions in their own gender transition journey, I hope that the government will be referencing the advice from the court to protect the right of all transgender people.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801885,Bayern unhappy with injured Manuel Neuer for club criticism,"BERLIN (AP) — Bayern Munich CEO Oliver Kahn, sporting director Hasan Salihamidžić and team coach Julian Nagelsmann have all criticized injured captain Manuel Neuer for publicly expressing his disappointment with the club.

            The dispute centers on Bayern’s decision to fire goalkeeping coach Toni Tapalović on Jan. 23 due to what Salihamidžić said were “differences over the ways and means of working together”.

            The firing was described by Neuer as “the worst thing I’ve experienced in my career” during an interview that appeared in the Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper and The Athletic website Friday.











            Kahn told news agency DPA that Neuer’s comments do ""neither justice to him as captain nor the values of Bayern” and he criticized the goalkeeper for their timing “ahead of very important games.”

            Salihamidžić accused Neuer of “putting his personal interests above those of the club”, while Nagelsmann on Sunday referred to Kahn’s statement and added his own criticism of Neuer.

            “From Manuel’s perspective, I wouldn’t have given the interview, especially when he says in the same interview that the club is the priority. It doesn’t help calm things down,” said Nagelsmann.

            Tapalović, who joined Bayern with Neuer from Schalke in 2011, did not get on with Nagelsmann, who must now contend with an openly unhappy goalkeeper – and possibly more.

            Kicker magazine reported Sunday that several team colleagues had expressed their solidarity with Neuer.

            “We see him every day in rehab, we say hello every day,” Thomas Müller said after Bayern’s 4-2 win in Wolfsburg on Sunday. “We have personalities in the club, the biggest club in Germany, national team players and legends like Manu. And of course a couple of things happened, everyone has their own point of view. But we don’t let the football business influence us as players.”

            Tapalović’s dismissal came just over a month after Neuer broke his leg in a skiing accident and was taken as a personal blow by the 37-year-old goalkeeper. Neuer is out for the rest of the season.

            “For me it was a blow as I was already on the ground,” Neuer told the Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper and The Athletic. “I felt my heart was being torn out.”

            Neuer, who faced a hostile reaction from Bayern fans when he joined the club from Schalke, said Tapalović’s dismissal was even more damaging for him personally.

            “Everyone in our goalkeeper group was torn apart. People burst into tears,” Neuer said in his first public comments on the matter since the coach was fired. ""Toni was loved by the whole team.”

            Bayern has signed Yann Sommer as the injured Neuer’s replacement from Borussia Mönchengladbach.

            Neuer, who praised the signing of Sommer, said he still doesn’t know why Tapalović was fired.

            “There was no justification from what I could understand. Things were said that I don’t agree with. But I haven’t heard any arguments that rule out talking to each other and clearing things up,” said Neuer, who added that the issue led to him considering his future at the club.

            Kahn referred to his own time as Germany goalkeeper, when he lost his place to Jens Lehmann after goalkeeping coach Sepp Maier left the German soccer federation.

            “I was also disappointed at the time and I was furious with the federation,” said Kahn. “But the common aims were top priority for me. They were more important than my personal feelings. That’s why I decided at the time not to express myself publicly. Manuel has now done the opposite.”

            Kahn said the club will talk to Neuer about the matter “very clearly.”

            Nagelsmann said he hadn’t talked to the goalkeeper since his interview but “I am a person in need of harmony and my door is not closed, even if I would have chosen a different path.”

            Bayern drew its first three Bundesliga games of the year and has seen its lead whittled down to a point.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801886,French lawmakers debate Macron's controversial pension bill,"PARIS (AP) — France’s parliament on Monday started debating a deeply controversial pension bill aiming to raise the minimum retirement age that’s touched off a wave of strikes and large street demonstrations, with more protests set to come this week.

            The lower house, the National Assembly, began debating the planned raising of the minimum retirement age from 62 to 64 a day before a third round of protests called by eight main workers’ unions, with more demonstrations planned Saturday. 

            French President Emmanuel Macron’s government is now facing a harsh political battle in parliament that could span weeks or months.











            Macron vowed to go ahead with the changes – his second presidential term’s flagship legislation — which he described last week as “indispensable when you compare to (other countries) in Europe.” 

            Despite opinion polls consistently showing growing opposition to the reform and his own popularity shrinking, Macron insisted that he's living up to a key campaign pledge he made when he swept to power in 2017 and again ahead of his reelection in April. 

            Labor Minister Olivier Dussopt vigorously defended the bill Monday, saying: “We are here! I believe deeply in this reform. We will be part of improving our social model, we’re not deceiving people!”

            Public Accounts Minister Gabriel Attal took it a step further by calling it a stark choice between “reform or bankruptcy.”

            But left-wing opposition leaders said many voters cast their ballots for Macron without embracing his election platform, including pension reform. They argued votes for Macron in last year’s runoff were primarily cast to rebuff his far-right rival Marine Le Pen.

            Last week, an estimated 1.27 million people took to the streets, according to authorities, more than in the first big protest day on Jan. 19. Unions and political opponents hope massive mobilization will force the government to revise its plans. 

            Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne said the government understands people's reluctance and concerns, but “we are asking French people for a collective effort."" She said the reform aims to “save"" the French pension system, which is expected to plunge into deficit in the coming decade in light of France's aging population.

            More than 20,000 amendments have been proposed by opposition lawmakers — mostly by the left-wing Nupes coalition.

            In a parliamentary election in June, Macron’s centrist alliance won the most seats but lost its majority. That led centrists to try and forge an alliance with The Republicans party, conservatives who have also in recent years tried to raise the retirement age. 

            The Republicans leader and lawmaker Eric Ciotti said in an interview with Le Parisien newspaper Saturday that a “very large majority” of his party would approve the reforms on condition that the government listens to its “accurate proposals.""

            That would secure passage through the National Assembly and the Senate, where The Republicans have a majority.

            The bill would gradually increase the minimum retirement age from 62 to 64 by 2030 and accelerate a planned measure providing that people must have worked for at least 43 years to be entitled to a full pension. It would also raise the minimum pension for a full career to 1,200 euros ($1,298) per month, among other measures.

            It would allow early retirement for those who had started working between 16 and 19 years of age, as well as for workers with serious health issues.

            In response to a demand by The Republicans, Borne told the Journal du Dimanche weekly newspaper that she agrees with allowing those who started working at age 20 to claim their pension at 63.

            Some technical issues could complicate Macron's plans. 

            The government would have the legal power to enact the reforms through decrees if neither the National Assembly nor the Senate hold a vote on them before a 50-day deadline expires next month. 

            Analysts argue that could trigger allegations of skirting proper democratic debate in parliament on an such a major issue. 

            Moreover if the bill passes, the Constitutional Council is expected to rule on the reforms, possibly condensing its scope if they aren't deemed to be in line with the wider budget bill.PARIS (AP) — France’s parliament on Monday started debating a deeply controversial pension bill aiming to raise the minimum retirement age that’s touched off a wave of strikes and large street demonstrations, with more protests set to come this week.The lower house, the National Assembly, began debating the planned raising of the minimum retirement age from 62 to 64 a day before a third round of protests called by eight main workers’ unions, with more demonstrations planned Saturday.French President Emmanuel Macron’s government is now facing a harsh political battle in parliament that could span weeks or months.Macron vowed to go ahead with the changes – his second presidential term’s flagship legislation — which he described last week as “indispensable when you compare to (other countries) in Europe.”Despite opinion polls consistently showing growing opposition to the reform and his own popularity shrinking, Macron insisted that he's living up to a key campaign pledge he made when he swept to power in 2017 and again ahead of his reelection in April.Labor Minister Olivier Dussopt vigorously defended the bill Monday, saying: “We are here!

He was not scheduled to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin during his visit.The IAEA is trying to get Moscow and Kyiv to agree to a safe zone around the facility. Such a zone would ensure that the power plant would not be fired upon and that there would be no shelling from there.Last month Ryabkov told Russia's RIA Novosti ""the negotiation process is not progressing easily.""After talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy last month, Grossi warned a nuclear accident could happen any day and reiterated the situation at the plant was very precarious.""I worry that this is becoming routine, that people may believe that nothing has happened so far, so is the director general of the IAEA crying wolf?""""It (an accident) can happen any time and my duty is to do everything I can to prevent that from happening,"" he added.Here are other updates on the war in Ukraine on Sunday, February 6:At least 46 people were killed in the Ukrainian city of Dnipro when a Russian missile strike hit a block of apartments in January.DW’s Max Zander went to Dnipro to meet a rescuer and a survivor of the attack.There'll be no changes at the top of Ukraine's defense ministry this week, David Arakhamia, leader of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's party in parliament, wrote on his Telegram channel.On Sunday, Arakhamia said Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov would be replaced, following a corruption scandal over which his deputy had already resigned. Reznikov had said he would only resign if Zelenskyy asked him to.Arakhamia said the military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov would become the new defense minister.On Monday, he wrote ""There will be no personnel changes in the defense sector this week,"" without further details.Canada's Defense Minister, Anita Anand, posted an image of the first Leopard 2 tank donated by her country to Ukraine, arriving in Poland.""Alongside our allies, we'll soon be training the armed forces of Ukraine in the use of this equipment,"" she wrote.Canada said it would send four Leopard 2 battle tanks to Ukraine.It follows a decision last month by Chancellor Olaf Scholz to allow the German-made tanks to be exported to Ukraine.Germany said it would provide one company of 14 Leopard 2 tanks.Kyiv's allies hope to send at least two Leopard 2 tank battalions with around 80 vehicles to Ukraine.Other countries, including Poland and Finland, have promised to send tanks.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that his country was ready to provide necessary assistance to Turkey in the aftermath of the devastating earthquake.""Shocked by the news about the death and injury of hundreds of people as a result of the earthquake in Turkey,"" Zelenskyy wrote on Twitter.""We send our condolences to the families of the victims and wish the injured a speedy recovery.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801905,Russia steps up threats against Republic of Moldova,"Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has suggested that Moldova is the West's new ""anti-Russian project."" In an interview for Russian state television, he declared that the West had now ""set its sights on the Republic of Moldova to have the role of the next Ukraine.""Russia's more or less direct threats against Moldova have intensified since it began the war of aggression against Ukraine almost a year ago.In the interview, which was banned from broadcast in Moldova because of accusations of propaganda, Lavrov also stated that pro-European Moldovan President Maia Sandu had been appointed with methods that were ""far from being freely democratic"" and that she was pursuing a deeply anti-Russian approach. He added that she was ""a president who wants to join NATO, has Romanian citizenship, is ready to unite with Romania and, in general, is ready for almost anything.""""This is one of the countries that the West wants to turn into another anti-Russia,"" he said.The foreign minister continued by criticizing the Moldovan government in Chisinau for refusing to resume the 5+2 negotiations on resolving the Transnistria conflict. Russia and the separatist regime in Transnistria, a pro-Russian breakaway region that split from Moldova in the early 1990s after a bloody war, insist that talks should continue, especially considering the setbacks of the Russian army in Ukraine.Lavrov said that ""hand in hand with the pro-NATO, pro-EU drive,"" the fact that Moldova refused to resume the negotiations spoke ""volumes."" He added that Moldova was even planning to expel Russian ""peacekeepers"" from Transnistria.There are some 2,000 Russian soldiers stationed in Transnistria, which is a narrow strip of land in eastern Moldova. Many of them are there to guard a former Soviet ammunition depot in the village of Cobasna that contains up to 20,000 tons of Soviet-era weapons. It is the largest such depot in Europe. In 1999, Russia committed to withdrawing troops and weapons, but it has not fulfilled this promise.At the end of January, the Moldovan president said that there was a ""serious discussion"" about her country's capacity to defend itself and whether it should be part of a ""larger alliance"" in an interview with the US magazine Politico. She added: ""And if we come, at some point, to the conclusion as a nation that we need to change neutrality, this should happen through a democratic process.""Moldova's neutrality, which is enshrined in the constitution, has become the subject of more intense debate since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. However, there would currently not be enough support in parliament for a constitutional amendment.But in the wake of President Sandu's remarks, there have been several veiled warnings from Russian politicians close to Russian President Vladimir Putin, that joining NATO would be a sure way of destroying the state of Moldova.Moreover, in a video conference with Russian politicians, Vitali Ignatiev, the so-called foreign minister of Transnistria, complained about ""increased pressure"" on the unrecognized republic due to the fact that the Moldovan army had expanded its defense capacities. He also said that there was increasing ""repression of everything Russian"" in Moldova. This is an argument typically used by Russian propagandists to justify military aggression against independent states, including Ukraine and Georgia.The Moldovan Foreign Ministry was quick to react to the latest threats by Lavrov. It said that the remarks did not correspond to the truth and continued ""the already well-known threatening rhetoric of Russian diplomacy.""Nicu Popescu, the foreign minister and deputy prime minister of Moldova, said that his country categorically rejected this tone in bilateral relations with Russia. He reminded the government in Moscow that Moldovan citizens wanted peace, prosperity and democracy, and that they wanted to join the European Union.Moldova declared solidarity with its neighbor Ukraine immediately after the Russian invasion on February 24, 2022, and simplified measures for refugees crossing the border. The country has consistently condemned Russia's attacks on Ukraine's population and critical infrastructure. At every international meeting, Moldovan politicians have issued warnings about the increased security risks for their country.Gunther Krichbaum, the former head of the Bundestag EU affairs committee and an expert in Eastern and Southeast European politics, said in a DW interview that Russia's threats against Moldova showed once again how aggressive Russia was and that it was important to put it in its place now. ""This war must not be worth it for Russia, Ukraine must win the war,"" he said.He added that all politicians advocating appeasement should finally understand that Russia would not stop at a victory over Ukraine and would keep on with its invasions. He said that Moldova would be the next victim and would not be able to stand up to Russia. Then, according to Krichbaum, it would go on with Georgia and then the Baltic states would have to worry. ""Therefore, Russia must be stopped now.""This article was translated from German.",2023/2/4,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801906,Man City accused of misleading Premier League over finances,"Manchester City was accused by the Premier League on Monday of providing misleading information about its finances over a nine-year period when the club was attempting to establish itself as a force in English and European soccer following its takeover by Abu Dhabi’s ruling family.

            The explosive development came after a four-year investigation by the world's most popular soccer league in the wake of leaked club emails and documents from City officials, published by German magazine Der Spiegel in 2018. The documents showed the extent of the schemes to allegedly cover up the true source of income in a bid to comply with financial regulations.

            The Premier League has financial fair play rules designed to ensure clubs essentially spend what they earn from deals that are assessed for being at legitimate market value. The case could lead to a fine or a worse punishment, like a deduction in points.











            The league released a long statement detailing a list of about 80 alleged breaches of its financial rules by City from 2009-18, the first nine full seasons under Abu Dhabi ownership. In that time, the team won three Premier League titles — in 2012, 2014 and 2018 — in what has become the most successful period in City's 143-year history.

            The league also accused City of 30 more breaches relating to its alleged failure to co-operate with the investigation since December 2018.

            The breaches were referred to an independent commission, which will be made up of three judges appointed by a lawyer who chairs the league’s judicial panel. The commission's hearing will be held in secret and there is no timetable for a verdict.

            In a statement, City said it was “surprised"" by the allegations, “particularly given the extensive engagement and vast amount of detailed materials that the EPL (English Premier League) has been provided with.”

            “The club welcomes the review of this matter by an independent commission to impartially consider the comprehensive body of irrefutable evidence that exists in support of its position,"" City said. “As such we look forward to this matter being put to rest once and for all.”

            The league has accused City of breaching rules requiring provision “in utmost good faith” of “accurate financial information that gives a true and fair view of the club’s financial position” between 2009-18 and failing to give “full details of manager remuneration in its relevant contracts” from 2009-13. Roberto Mancini was manager during that period.

            The third and fourth offenses are a failure to comply with UEFA regulations from 2013-18 and the Premier League's profitability and sustainability rules from 2015-18.

            For the fifth offense, City is accused of breaching rules requiring clubs to “co-operate with and assist the Premier League with its investigations” from December 2018 to the present day.

            City, the defending Premier League champion and a team owning some of the world's top players like Erling Haaland and Kevin De Bruyne, could be at risk of severe punishment. The league’s rule book gives a disciplinary commission powers to impose a range of sanctions plus the wider scope of “such other penalty as it shall think fit.”

            A large fine seems inevitable if the charges are proven. Also in play is a point deduction, a title nullified or even being expelled from the Premier League, according to league rules.

            City never disputed that the documents leaked by Der Spiegel were authentic, but has argued the evidence was stolen and reported out of context.

            While City was under investigation by the Premier League, the club had a two-year ban from European club competitions overturned by the Court of Arbitration for Sport in 2020 after UEFA ruled City committed “serious breaches” of financial fair play regulations from 2012-16. That case arose on the back of the leaked information, too.

            The published evidence appeared to show City deceived UEFA by overstating sponsorship deals from 2012-16 and hid the source of revenue linked to state-backed companies in Abu Dhabi.

            As for Mancini, the evidence in Der Spiegel showed he doubled his base salary of 1.45 million pounds (now $1.75 million) for advising a club in Abu Dhabi.

            City was not fully cleared of wrongdoing in the UEFA case, though CAS said some of the allegations were not proven or could not be judged because of a statute of limitations in UEFA rules. There are no such time limits on the finances under investigation by the Premier League.

            CAS also fined City 10 million euros (then $11.3 million) for failing to cooperate with investigators. The club’s “blatant disregard” should be “strongly condemned,” the court’s judges said.

            City has been transformed into an English soccer power since being bought in September 2008 by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, a deputy prime minister of the United Arab Emirates and a member of Abu Dhabi’s royal family.

            A report from Deloitte last month said Man City generated the highest revenue of any club in the world — totaling 619.1 million pounds ($745 million) in the 2021-22 season.

            Under its Abu Dhabi ownership, City — which previously lived in the shadow of neighbor Manchester United — has won six Premier League titles, two FA Cups and six English League Cups.

            The team is in second place in the Premier League midway through this season, five points behind Arsenal having played one game more.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801907,Struggling Hoffenheim fires André Breitenreiter as coach,"SINSHEIM, Germany (AP) — Struggling Hoffenheim fired André Breitenreiter as coach on Monday after seven months in charge and a run of nine Bundesliga games without a win.

            Hoffenheim hasn’t won since beating last-place Schalke in the league and then the cup in mid-October.

            Breitenreiter’s last game in charge was Saturday’s 5-2 loss at relegation rival Bochum. It left the team 14th in the 18-team division, three points above the relegation zone. Hoffenheim has conceded 17 goals in five matches in 2023.











            “We made mistakes that have little to do with professional soccer,” Breitenreiter acknowledged after the latest loss. “Something has to happen, it can’t continue like this. It will be very difficult to survive (avoid relegation) like this.”

            Hoffenheim signed American defender John Brooks from Benfica and Danish midfielder Thomas Delaney on loan from Sevilla in the transfer window to bring more experience to the team.

            The 49-year-old Breitenreiter, who led Zurich to the Swiss league title last season, won four of his first six Bundesliga games to leave Hoffenheim in fourth spot in mid-September, but has beaten only Schalke since. 

            The club acknowledged that good start in its statement firing him. “We thank him for the pleasant cooperation and the many positive moments, especially at the beginning of the time we spent together,” sporting director Alexander Rosen said.

            Hoffenheim, from rural southwestern Germany, has been a Bundesliga team since 2008 after a rapid rise through the lower leagues fuelled by software billionaire Dietmar Hopp, who was a player at the club in his youth.

            More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsSINSHEIM, Germany (AP) — Struggling Hoffenheim fired André Breitenreiter as coach on Monday after seven months in charge and a run of nine Bundesliga games without a win.Hoffenheim hasn’t won since beating last-place Schalke in the league and then the cup in mid-October.Breitenreiter’s last game in charge was Saturday’s 5-2 loss at relegation rival Bochum. It left the team 14th in the 18-team division, three points above the relegation zone. Hoffenheim has conceded 17 goals in five matches in 2023.“We made mistakes that have little to do with professional soccer,” Breitenreiter acknowledged after the latest loss. “Something has to happen, it can’t continue like this. It will be very difficult to survive (avoid relegation) like this.”Hoffenheim signed American defender John Brooks from Benfica and Danish midfielder Thomas Delaney on loan from Sevilla in the transfer window to bring more experience to the team.The 49-year-old Breitenreiter, who led Zurich to the Swiss league title last season, won four of his first six Bundesliga games to leave Hoffenheim in fourth spot in mid-September, but has beaten only Schalke since.The club acknowledged that good start in its statement firing him. “We thank him for the pleasant cooperation and the many positive moments, especially at the beginning of the time we spent together,” sporting director Alexander Rosen said.Hoffenheim, from rural southwestern Germany, has been a Bundesliga team since 2008 after a rapid rise through the lower leagues fuelled by software billionaire Dietmar Hopp, who was a player at the club in his youth.Breitenreiter is the sixth Bundesliga coach to lose his job this season after Pellegrino Matarazzo (Stuttgart), Domenico Tedesco (Leipzig), Frank Kramer (Schalke), Gerardo Seoane (Bayer Leverkusen) and Thomas Reis (Bochum).___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/2/6,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801909,Kenya labor court rules that Facebook can be sued,"NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — A judge in Kenya has ruled that Facebook’s parent company, Meta, can be sued in the East African country. 

            Meta tried to have the case dropped, arguing that Kenyan courts do not have jurisdiction over their operations, but the labor court judge dismissed that in a ruling on Monday.

            A former Facebook moderator in Kenya, Daniel Motaung, is suing the company claiming poor working conditions. 











            Motaung said that while working as a moderator he was exposed to gruesome content such as rape, torture, and beheadings that risked his and his colleagues’ mental health.

            He said Meta did not offer mental health support to employees, required unreasonably long working hours, and offered minimal pay. Motaung worked in Facebook’s African hub in Kenya’s capital, Nairobi, which is operated by Samasource Ltd.

            Following the judge's decision that Meta can be sued in Kenya, the next step in the case will be considered by the court on Mar. 8.

            Amnesty International Kenya Executive Director Irungu Houghton termed the ruling as “historic.”

            “This is a significant step that ensures the authority of Kenyan courts to protect and enforce fundamental human rights … The social media platforms have serious impacts on people’s lives and societies. They must be more accountable,” he said in a statement.

            Meta is facing a separate court case in which two Ethiopians say hate speech was allowed and even promoted on Facebook amid heated rhetoric over their country’s deadly Tigray conflict.

            That lawsuit alleges that Meta hasn’t hired enough content moderators to adequately monitor posts, that it uses an algorithm that prioritizes hateful content, and that it responds more slowly to crises in Africa than elsewhere in the world.

            The Associated Press and more than a dozen other media outlets last year reported that Facebook had failed to quickly and effectively moderate hate speech in several places around the world, including in Ethiopia. The reports were based on internal Facebook documents leaked by former employee and whistleblower Frances Haugen.NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — A judge in Kenya has ruled that Facebook’s parent company, Meta, can be sued in the East African country.Meta tried to have the case dropped, arguing that Kenyan courts do not have jurisdiction over their operations, but the labor court judge dismissed that in a ruling on Monday.A former Facebook moderator in Kenya, Daniel Motaung, is suing the company claiming poor working conditions.Motaung said that while working as a moderator he was exposed to gruesome content such as rape, torture, and beheadings that risked his and his colleagues’ mental health.He said Meta did not offer mental health support to employees, required unreasonably long working hours, and offered minimal pay.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801910,ChatGPT bot channels history to pen State of Union speech,"WASHINGTON (AP) — If you’ve heard it once in a president's State of the Union speech, you’ve heard it 100 times: There is nothing the American people can’t do when they pull together.

            But you haven’t heard that thought in a State of Union address from William Shakespeare: “Lo,” said the bard. “With kindness, love, and understanding clear, we shall conquer all, and have naught to fear.”

            Nor from the noggin-knocking Three Stooges of last century's fame: “We just put our heads together, come up with a plan, and bam! Problem solved!”











            Let's face it, State of the Union speeches are mostly rote. Presidents roll out a list of accomplishments, a few anecdotes about guests in attendance, a sober assessment of the problems of the day and a crescendo about glory times ahead.

            To shake up the formula before President Joe Biden's speech to Congress on Tuesday night, The Associated Press instructed the artificial intelligence program ChatGPT to work up State of the Union speeches as they might have been written by some of history's greatest minds as well as some stooges.

            AP ordered 300-word versions, in contrast to Biden's sprawling 6,400 words last year, and tapped a few people so iconic we know them by only one name. The virtual Greek philosopher Aristotle gracefully quoted Socrates, Cleopatra the historic Egyptian ruler asked for the blessing of the gods, Madonna cited her perspective as a mother and a woman in entertainment.

            ChatGPT was also asked to channel singer Elvis Presley, civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., Indian independence leader Mahatma Gandhi, the ground-breaking NASA mathematician Katherine Johnson and baseball's Yogi Berra, among others.

            The app is part of a new generation of AI systems that can converse in human-like fashion and generate text based on what they’ve learned from a vast database. Some teachers worry their students will use it instead of their brains for school papers.

            ChatGPT rendered Shakespeare's State of the Union speech in rhyme. The version channeling comedian Jerry Seinfeld captured his signature phrasings.

            For all the app's smarts, it wasn't all-knowing. In the speech channeling King, it had the civil rights leader quoting himself. It conveyed none of Abraham Lincoln's eloquence. And it declined to take a run at drafting 2023 Biden's speech, instead serving up a rehash of his last one.

            It also drew a blank when asked for a speech from George Santos, the New York Republican congressman who was caught fictionalizing his past.

            “George Santos is not a widely recognized public figure or historical figure,” the app responded. “There is no widely known information about a person by this name in the public domain.""

            Excerpts of some of the speeches ChatGPT generated:

            My Lords and Ladies, countrymen and women, Gather ye here today to hear what I say, In this great hall of ours, let us unite, And listen to the state of our fair state.

            We stand today as one, in good health and grace, Prosperous and free, with a peaceful space, Our trade and commerce flourish, wealth abounds, With bountiful harvests, and peace surrounds.

            But, lo, there are still challenges we face, For not all are equal in our fair place, We must work together to bridge the divide, And bring forth equality, from side to side.

            Let us not forget, our soldiers bold and brave, Who fought for freedom, and our country gave, Their lives and limbs, for our safety and peace, We must repay them with honors and release.

            And so I say, let us work hand in hand, To build a brighter future, in this fair land, With kindness, love, and understanding clear, We shall conquer all, and have naught to fear.

            And now, my friends, I bid thee all farewell, And trust that thou wilt work, with heart and will, For the good of all, and the betterment of man, Together we shall build, a stronger, better land.

            My fellow Americans,

            We gather here today, at a momentous time in our nation’s history, to address the state of our union. And as we do so, I am reminded of the words of the great prophet Amos, who declared, “Let justice roll down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream.”

            For too long, justice has been denied to too many in our society. For too long, righteousness has been an elusive dream. And it is time for us to awaken from this slumber and work together to build a more perfect union.

            We cannot be satisfied until every American, regardless of race, religion, or background, has an equal opportunity to achieve the American dream. ... But let us not become discouraged, for we have made progress. We have seen a civil rights movement that brought about change, and we will continue to see change in our time. For as Dr. King said, “The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.”

            So let us bend that arc, together. Let us roll down justice and righteousness like waters. Let us create a society where every person is valued and respected, where every person has an equal chance to succeed.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801927,Concern rises for lives of 2 Thai activists on hunger strike,"BANGKOK (AP) — Concerns about the condition of two hunger strikers seeking political and judicial reforms in Thailand heightened Monday after the hospital where the two women are being kept urgently summoned their parents. 

            Tantawan “Tawan” Tuatulanon, 21, and Orawan “Bam” Phuphong, 23, have been on hunger strike since Jan. 18 — much of that time refusing water as well as food — to back their demands for reform of the justice system, the release of political prisoners pending trial and for lawmakers to amend or abolish laws used against political dissidents.

            Their lawyer, Krisadang Nutcharas, said they are in poor condition, and at risk of losing their lives. 











            ""Their parents didn’t sleep last night and they have been here since morning,” said Krisadang at the Thammasat University Hospital in a northern suburb of Bangkok, the capital. “This is not a scripted drama to ask people for their sympathy.”

            The two women agreed a few days ago to resume taking water. Refusing all liquids in addition to food can cause permanent injury and even death if carried on for an extended period.

            The two activists are among at least 228 people, including 18 minors, have been charged with violating the lese majeste law, which carries a prison term of three to 15 years for insulting the monarchy. Critics say the law, also known as Article 112, is often wielded as a tool to quash political dissent. Student-led pro-democracy protests beginning in 2020 openly criticized the monarchy, previously a taboo subject, leading to vigorous prosecutions under the law, which had previously been relatively rarely employed.

            Sitthichok Sethasavet, a food delivery driver convicted in January of lese majeste, is also on a hunger strike and being kept at the same hospital.

            Tantawan and Orawan were charged with lese majeste for conducting public polls on whether people felt bothered by royal motorcades, which can lead to road closures and heavy traffic. They also face other charges such as sedition and refusing to comply with authorities. 

            The two women had been free on bail but announced earlier this month that they were revoking their own release to return to prison in solidarity with others held pending trial on the same charge whom they want to be freed, saying that's the main issue at this point.

            Krisadang said Monday he reapplied for the release on bail of eight others from the same activist group who have been detained pending trial after they were accused of breaking the law while taking part in political protests. Several previous applications have been turned down.

            A Sunday statement by Thammasat University Hospital said the condition of both young women is deteriorating as they continue to reject food and treatment and are only sipping water.

            Tantawan is bleeding through her gums in addition to suffering from fatigue, low blood sugar, stomach pains and trouble sleeping, while her body is lacking in electrolytes and her blood is also becoming acidic, the statement said.

            It said Orawan is experiencing similar ailments in addition to a blood clotting disorder, tired legs and nausea.

            Opposition political parties have joined the hunger strikers' call for releasing the prisoners, but sympathizers have also been imploring the women to save themselves.

            “I truly believe that no one should have to sacrifice their lives to ask for basic democratic rights in a modern democratic society, which includes the right to equal treatment in the justice system and the right to bail,"" popular opposition figure Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit said in a video message posted Sunday on a “Return lives, return the right to bail” Facebook page.BANGKOK (AP) — Concerns about the condition of two hunger strikers seeking political and judicial reforms in Thailand heightened Monday after the hospital where the two women are being kept urgently summoned their parents.Tantawan “Tawan” Tuatulanon, 21, and Orawan “Bam” Phuphong, 23, have been on hunger strike since Jan. 18 — much of that time refusing water as well as food — to back their demands for reform of the justice system, the release of political prisoners pending trial and for lawmakers to amend or abolish laws used against political dissidents.Their lawyer, Krisadang Nutcharas, said they are in poor condition, and at risk of losing their lives.""Their parents didn’t sleep last night and they have been here since morning,” said Krisadang at the Thammasat University Hospital in a northern suburb of Bangkok, the capital. “This is not a scripted drama to ask people for their sympathy.”The two women agreed a few days ago to resume taking water.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801928,Vinícius Júnior again targeted by racist insults in Spain,"MADRID (AP) — The hate attacks against Vinícius Júnior continued in Spain over the weekend, with the Brazil forward again being targeted by racist insults in a league match.

            The Spanish league said Monday it will investigate the latest attacks after television images showed someone calling him a monkey during Real Madrid’s 1-0 loss at Mallorca on Sunday.

            Vinícius was also insulted after the match when he stopped to pose for photos and sign autographs for fans. 











            Vinícius, who is Black, has been subjected to insults since he came to play in Spain five years ago, and last month the attacks reached a new level when his effigy was hanged off a bridge in Madrid ahead of the derby against Atletico Madrid in the Copa del Rey.

            He had also been targeted by fans in other stadiums before, including at Barcelona’s Camp Nou. The hate attacks also occurred in games at Valladolid and Athletic Bilbao.

            The league has been reporting the insults to the Spanish soccer federation and to local authorities, and said it would do the same this time after “intolerable racist insults against Vinícius were again observed.”

            The league said it was “working with RCD Mallorca to identify those responsible in order to take all necessary legal measures.” To speed up the process, the league said it created an email (StopRacismo@laliga.es) so fans who may have images or knowledge of those responsible can make contact and help it file the appropriate complaints.

            Authorities were yet to find those responsible for hanging Vinícius’ effigy before the game against Atletico, and so far teams have not been punished for the racist insults against the Brazilian inside their stadiums.

            An anti-violence committee said it was studying punishment to the Valladolid fans who insulted Vinícius in a match in December, which could include fines of 4,000 euros ($4,300) to each individual identified, as well as banning them from sports venues for one year.

            Last year a large group of Atletico fans chanted “Vinícius, you are a monkey” outside Metropolitano Stadium, but Spanish state prosecutors closed a probe into the case citing a lack of evidence and downplayed its seriousness because the chants allegedly came within the rivalry setting of a soccer match.

            The first trial against a fan who racially insulted a player in Spain is expected to begin this year following remarks by an Espanyol supporter against Athletic Bilbao forward Iñaki Williams a few years ago.

            Vinícius has been outspoken about the attacks against him but has yet to comment on the events from Sunday. 

            Real Madrid has also complained about how Vinícius, a speedy attacker known for his nifty dribbles, has been targeted by opposing players on the field. Valencia defender Gabriel Paulista was sent off in a game last week after a vicious foul on the Brazilian. Vinicius was also roughed up several times against Mallorca.

            The 22-year-old Vinícius was also recently engulfed in controversy for his dancing in goal celebrations. 

            “There is an environment being created surrounding Vinícius that doesn’t really help anyone, neither Vinícius nor the fans, who end up provoking him without really knowing why,"" Madrid defender Nacho Fernández said after Sunday's match. ""It’s time to put these controversies and nonsense to the side.”

The hate attacks also occurred in games at Valladolid and Athletic Bilbao.The league has been reporting the insults to the Spanish soccer federation and to local authorities, and said it would do the same this time after “intolerable racist insults against Vinícius were again observed.”The league said it was “working with RCD Mallorca to identify those responsible in order to take all necessary legal measures.” To speed up the process, the league said it created an email (StopRacismo@laliga.es) so fans who may have images or knowledge of those responsible can make contact and help it file the appropriate complaints.Authorities were yet to find those responsible for hanging Vinícius’ effigy before the game against Atletico, and so far teams have not been punished for the racist insults against the Brazilian inside their stadiums.An anti-violence committee said it was studying punishment to the Valladolid fans who insulted Vinícius in a match in December, which could include fines of 4,000 euros ($4,300) to each individual identified, as well as banning them from sports venues for one year.Last year a large group of Atletico fans chanted “Vinícius, you are a monkey” outside Metropolitano Stadium, but Spanish state prosecutors closed a probe into the case citing a lack of evidence and downplayed its seriousness because the chants allegedly came within the rivalry setting of a soccer match.The first trial against a fan who racially insulted a player in Spain is expected to begin this year following remarks by an Espanyol supporter against Athletic Bilbao forward Iñaki Williams a few years ago.Vinícius has been outspoken about the attacks against him but has yet to comment on the events from Sunday.Real Madrid has also complained about how Vinícius, a speedy attacker known for his nifty dribbles, has been targeted by opposing players on the field. Valencia defender Gabriel Paulista was sent off in a game last week after a vicious foul on the Brazilian. Vinicius was also roughed up several times against Mallorca.The 22-year-old Vinícius was also recently engulfed in controversy for his dancing in goal celebrations.“There is an environment being created surrounding Vinícius that doesn’t really help anyone, neither Vinícius nor the fans, who end up provoking him without really knowing why,"" Madrid defender Nacho Fernández said after Sunday's match. ""It’s time to put these controversies and nonsense to the side.”___Tales Azzoni on Twitter: http://twitter.com/tazzoni___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/2/6,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801929,Retailers try to curb theft while not angering shoppers,"NEW YORK (AP) — When the pandemic threat eased, Maureen Holohan was eager to scale back her online shopping and return to physical stores so she could more easily compare prices and scour ingredients on beauty and health care products for herself and her three children.

            But that experience was short lived. In the past six months or so, CVS, Target and other retailers where Holohan shops have been locking up more everyday items like deodorant and laundry detergent as a way to reduce theft. And the 56-year-old Chevy Chase, Maryland resident is now back to shopping online or visiting stores where she doesn't have to wait for someone to retrieve products.

            “I know they’ve got to do something, but locking the stuff up definitely just has me walking by that aisle,” said Holohan, a business consultant.











            Across the retail landscape, businesses have been putting items under lock and key as a quick way to stop thieves. Some are considering extreme measures, including Rite Aid Corp., whose chief retail officer Andre Persaud told analysts on an earnings call late last year that it’s looking at “literally putting everything behind showcases to ensure the products are there for customers who want to buy it.” It’s also considering using off-duty police officers at some of its stores.

            But by trying to solve one problem, these businesses may be creating another: turning off shoppers with overreaching measures.

            “Everything has changed. We used to be catered to,” said Sheila Schlegel, 43, of Queens, New York. 

            But now, “if you’re coming to the store, there’s one person at that store, and that person you can tell has been there for 15 hours,"" said Schlegel, who recalled an incident where she waited for a sales clerk to unlock an item only to be told he didn’t have the key. ""You don’t want to ask them for something if you don’t have to.”

            For consumers of color especially, the stepped-up security measures risk alienating a population that already feels overpoliced. That could unravel some of the inroads that chains like CVS, Sephora and Walmart made in the aftermath of George Floyd's murder in 2020, when they promised to avoid racially biased practices like locking up products only for Black customers.

            “Whenever there’s a push toward greater criminalization, whenever there’s a narrative of increased crime and things like that, it is always consumers of color that are going to be bearing the brunt,"" said Tiffany Gill, associate professor of history at Rutgers University, and an expert in African American Women’s History, fashion and beauty culture.

            CVS Health Corp. and Sephora declined to comment for the story. Walmart said that its position of not locking up beauty products for women of color remains the same. Target confirmed it was locking up more products but instead of targeting certain items, it locks up entire categories.

            It’s unclear how much money retailers are losing due to organized retail crime -- or if the problem has substantially increased. But the issue has received more notice in the past few years as high-profile smash-and-grab retail thefts and flash mob robberies have garnered national media attention. 

            The National Retail Federation, the nation’s largest retail trade group, said its latest security survey of roughly 60 retailers found that inventory loss -- called shrink — clocked in at an average rate of 1.4% last year, representing $94.5 billion in losses.

            The greatest portion of shrink — 37% — came from external theft, including products taken during organized shoplifting incidents, the trade group said. It also noted retailers, on average, saw a 26.5% uptick in organized theft incidents last year.

            But while high theft in stores depletes inventory and limits sales, locking up items also reduces sales — by 15% to 25%, according to Joe Budano, CEO of Indyme, a technology company that sells retailers security devices. 

            John Catsimatidis, who owns the New York supermarket chains Gristedes and D’Agostino’s, said the chain has locked up more products like aspirin and deodorant in the past year but not as many as his drug store chain rivals. His chains have also doubled the number of security guards at some of its stores

            He acknowledged that the move has resulted in some lost sales from impulse shopping but the added security has made shoppers more comfortable and has helped reduce theft, although he’s not sure by how much.

            “This is not an exact science,"" he said. 

            Store workers, meanwhile, face the pressure of trying to do their jobs while also monitoring theft. Isabela Burrows, 20, a manager at pet supplies chain PetSmart in Howell, Michigan, noted that her store in recent months has had to lock up more items like diffusers to calm dogs and cats and electric shaving shears. But while she feels more comfortable, she’s also had to deal with shopper annoyance.

            “I feel overwhelmed,” Burrows said. “They’re frustrated with me, and I have to find the item.”

            In what could be a sign of the overall challenges, drugstore chain Walgreens acknowledged that it might have overblown the shoplifting threat and gone too far in its security measures.

            “Maybe, we cried too much last year,” James Kehoe, global chief financial officer at Walgreens told analysts during an earnings call last month. “Probably we put in too much and we might step back a little bit from that.” 

            But a Walgreens spokesman cautioned that while the company is pleased to see retail theft levels starting to stabilize, they are “still a serious national problem affecting all retailers."" 

            Some retailers are coming out with less intrusive solutions to store theft. Home improvement retailer Lowe's has followed Home Depot in testing technology that unlocks power tools when shoppers buy them at the cash registers instead of resorting to keeping the items in cages.

            Anat Shakedd, the CEO and co-founder of Nexite, a company that makes tiny Bluetooth tags that can go on items, says her company has partnered with a top department store in the U.S. and other brands across Europe and Israel to help them monitor their inventory without locking things up. 

            The Freedom Case, developed by Indyme, asks shoppers for a cell phone number to opt into its service. The shoppers then receive a text message with a four-digit code that lets them open the case. Customers can retain their self-service privileges as long as they show normal shopping behaviors. But if they exhibit suspicious behaviors, store workers will be notified to provide assistance, he said.

            Holohan said she doesn't mind extra security guards, but she's not interested in giving out her phone number.

            “It's invasive,"" she said. ”If they’re going to make it that hard to buy something, I’ll find somewhere else to buy that.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801985,Norway looks to donate $7.3 billion in aid to Ukraine,"COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — Oil-rich Norway is looking to donate 75 billion kroner ($7.3 billion) to Kyiv as part of a five-year support package that would make the Scandinavian country one of the world’s biggest donors to war-torn Ukraine, the Norwegian government said Monday.

            Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre said the money would be split evenly between military and humanitarian assistance over five years, broken down to 15 billion kroner ($1.5 billion) annually. The proposed aid package will be put to a vote in parliament.

            Last week, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that overall, the European Union’s economic, humanitarian and military support for Ukraine now amounts to almost 50 billion euros. Earlier this month, the EU said it would unveil its 10th package of sanctions against Russia on the Feb. 24 anniversary of the war. It will target technology used by Russia’s war machine, among other things.











            Norway, which isn't an EU member, gave Ukraine more than 10 billion kroner ($1 billion) in civilian and military aid last year.

            “It will lead to an increased use of oil money,” Gahr Støre said, adding that he's hoping “a large majority” in the Norwegian parliament would approve the aid package. A parliamentary majority is expected to pass the proposal.

            “Supporting Ukraine is supporting a people experiencing war, but it is also support for our fundamental security,” Gahr Støre told a press conference.

             “We are showing the Ukrainians that we will support them for a long time,” adding it would make “it possible to plan better so that the money is used where the needs are greatest.”

            At a conference earlier Monday in Oslo, Gahr Støre spoke of a new Iron Curtain dividing east and west. 

            “The implications for Europe are hard to overestimate. A Russia in self-imposed isolation is bad news for of us.” He also said that “Ukraine’s needs are immense.”

            The government in Oslo also proposed to increase the aid to countries that are hit by the war in Ukraine by 5 billion kroner ($490 million) -– that money should be used on humanitarian aid and food. 

            Last week, the Norwegian government said that oil profits should go toward funding more aid to Ukraine.

            Norway is one of Europe’s largest fossil-fuel exporters, and the conflict in Ukraine has boosted its gas revenues. However, Norway has fended off accusations that it’s profiting from the war in Ukraine.

            A rush by European countries to secure alternative energy sources following Russia's invasion of Ukraine nearly a year ago dramatically increased the demand — and price — for Norway’s oil and gas.

However, Norway has fended off accusations that it’s profiting from the war in Ukraine.A rush by European countries to secure alternative energy sources following Russia's invasion of Ukraine nearly a year ago dramatically increased the demand — and price — for Norway’s oil and gas.___Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine: https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",2023/2/6,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801987,Russian forces keep up pressure as Ukraine anniversary nears,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russian forces are keeping Ukrainian troops tied down with attacks in the eastern Donbas region as Moscow assembles additional combat power there for an expected offensive in the coming weeks, Ukrainian officials said Monday.

            Intense fighting that has been raging for weeks continued around the city of Bakhmut and the nearby towns of Soledar and Vuhledar, Ukraine’s presidential office said.

            They are located in the Donetsk region, which with neighboring Luhansk region makes up the Donbas, an industrial area bordering Russia.











            “The battles for the region are heating up,” Donetsk Gov. Pavlo Kyrylenko said in televised remarks, adding that “the Russians are throwing new units into the battle and eradicating our towns and villages.”

            In Luhansk, Gov. Serhii Haidai said shelling there had subsided because “the Russians have been saving ammunition for a large-scale offensive.”

            Military analysts say the Kremlin’s forces may be probing Ukrainian defenses for weak points or could be making a feint while preparing for a main thrust through southern Ukraine.

            Ukraine envisages possible Russian offensives in the east and the south, Ukrainian military intelligence spokesman Vadym Skibitsky said. He predicted that Russia will likely press its offensive in the Donbas and could also launch an attack in the southern Zaporizhzhia region.

            He didn’t say when the offensive might start but noted that the Russian military would need another couple of months to complete the training of new units.

            Skibitsky added that Russia plans to mobilize another 300,000-500,000 in addition to the 300,000 mobilized in the fall.

            David Arakhamia, who leads Zelenskyy’s Servant of the People party in parliament, said Sunday that Ukraine is preparing for a Russian offensive while planning to counterattack and reclaim its occupied territory.

            Arakhamia, noting that “time and circumstances call for strengthening and regrouping,” also announced that Ukraine’s Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov would be moved to another government post and replaced by the head of military intelligence, Kyrylo Budanov. But Arakhamia abruptly changed course Monday and said that no shakeup will happen this week.

            Mariana Bezuhla, a Servant of the People party lawmaker, said officials decided to postpone the reshuffle following the analysis of “risks for the system as a whole” ahead of next week’s meeting with NATO allies.

            One of Reznikov’s deputies recently lost his job amid Zelenskyy’s crackdown on corruption. Reznikov said over the weekend that he was ready to step down if Zelenskyy decides it is best.

            Russian President Vladimir Putin is hungry for some battlefield success, especially securing illegally annexed territory in eastern Ukraine, to mark the anniversary of his invasion on Feb. 24.

            Russian forces made gains in the first few months of the war, though they failed to clinch key objectives and were then driven back from large areas by a Ukrainian counteroffensive.

            Western military help has been essential for Kyiv to fend off a far larger military force.

            The government of Norway aims to donate 75 billion kroner ($7.3 billion) in a multi-year support package to Ukraine, making the oil-rich Scandinavian country one of the world’s top donors. 

            Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre said Monday the money would be used for a military and civilian aid package over a five-year period once parliament gives its approval.

            Canadian Defense Minister Anita Anand tweeted late Sunday that the first German-made Leopard tank Canada is donating to Ukraine had arrived in Poland. It is part of a broad tank commitmen t by Ukraine’s Western allies to help it defeat Russia.

            Training for Ukrainian military on how to use the tank was due to begin “soon,” Anand said, as the allies race to get Ukraine’s forces ready before the looming offensive.

            Ukraine’s presidential office said Monday that at least one civilian had been killed and 10 others wounded by Russian shelling over the past 24 hours.

            Five of those were injured during the shelling of Kharkiv city, where Russian shells struck residential buildings and a university, the presidential office said.

            The Russians again fired at targets across the Dnieper River from the Russia-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, damaging residential buildings and power lines in Nikopol and Marhanets, Ukrainian authorities reported.

            Russian forces occupied Zaporizhzhia, Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant, early in the war, and regular shelling of the area stoked major safety concerns.

            The head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog is due to visit Moscow this week to discuss safety at Zaporizhzhia.

            International Atomic Energy Agency Director-General Rafael Grossi aims to “continue his consultations aimed at agreeing and implementing a nuclear safety and security protection zone” around the plant, IAEA spokesman Fredrik Dahl said.

            Martin Griffiths, the U.N. humanitarian chief, said Monday that nearly 8 million Ukrainians have fled to neighboring countries since the war started and 5.3 million are displaced within the country. He told the U.N. Security Council Monday that 17.6 million Ukrainians — almost 40% of the population — need humanitarian assistance. 

            Griffiths said that he will be launching an appeal later this month in Geneva for $3.9 billion to help more than 11 million people this year.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801988,48 arrested in Europe over encrypted app used in drug trade,"BERLIN (AP) — European investigators have shut down an encrypted communication service that was used as a secure channel for organized crime, particularly in the drug trade, and arrested 48 people, German authorities said Monday.

            More than 70 properties were searched in Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and Poland on Friday, when the arrests were made, the criminal police office in the western German state of Rhineland-Palatinate said in a statement. 

            It said that those arrested were users, operators and administrators of the communication service, Exclu. 











            The detentions resulted from an investigation launched in 2020, which had its roots in the shutdown the previous year of a former military bunker in western Germany that hosted sites dealing in drugs and other illegal activities. Those included Exclu.

            German authorities said Exclu was offered to users as a smartphone app, with a six-month license costing 800 euros ($860).

Global study on “Hydroponics” provides a comprehensive assessment of the market’s current and future state.The hydroponics market was worth USD 2.3 billion in 2022. It is expected to grow at 7.9% CAGR between 2022 and 2030.Hydroponics refers to the process of growing plants using mineral nutrients in sand, gravel or liquid in place of soil.

Hydroponics, a subset, is one of the fastest growing soil-less farming methods at a global scale. It uses mineral nutrient solutions in water and does not require soil.Request for a sample report here: https://market.biz/report/global-hydroponics-market-qy/429027/#requestforsampleHydroponics is a market that has seen a higher yield than traditional farming practices. Hydroponic plants have a 2-5x higher productivity than traditional agriculture systems. These systems can also be used to balance the effects of climate change on the plants, which does not affect the annual crop production. The crop harvest cycle is immediately affected by CEH techniques. Because of the minor impact that climate changes have on these systems, crops can still be grown all year. This improves the annual produce.Global market growth may also be driven by the popularity of salad crops and the growing need for food security. Hydroponics technology is becoming more popular worldwide. Researchers and manufacturers are also working to improve its efficiency in order to increase the yield and quality of their produce.Certain challenges and restraints will limit market growth. Market growth is being impeded by factors like high capital investment in large-scale farms. The main cost factors for a hydroponic farm are different types of equipment, including fans, HVAC systems and ventilation, irrigation systems, control system, rails, lights, and control systems. The global Hydroponics Market is facing potential challenges due to the lack of tax incentives and government policies in developing countries, as well as the spread of waterborne diseases like algae in closed systems.Media Filled Growbeds (MFG)

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802061,Deadly earthquake exacerbates suffering of displaced Syrians,"DARKUSH, Syria (AP) — A steady stream of injured flowed into an overwhelmed hospital in the town of Darkush, in rebel-held northwestern Syria on Monday, after a deadly earthquake struck the region. Mothers hovered over crying children. 

            Amid the chaos, one man sat with a dazed expression, his face covered with abrasions.

            The man, Osama Abdul Hamid, barely made it out alive with his wife and four children from his apartment building in the nearby village of Azmarin. Many of their neighbors were not so lucky. 











            “The building is four stories, and from three of them, no one made it out,” Abdul Hamid said, breaking down in tears. “God gave me a new lease on life.”

            At an equally overwhelmed hospital in Idlib city, Shajul Islam, a British doctor who works with several non-governmental organizations, was having the worst day of his seven years working in Syria.

            “I’m literally taking a patient off a ventilator to give another patient a chance, having to decide which patient has more of a chance of surviving or not,” Islam said.

            The hospital, already struggling with weak health infrastructure and funding cuts, he said, was particularly overburdened after the earthquake because other hospitals in the area were out of commission.

            “We’ve got quite a lot of hospitals that had been previously hit in the war. So they had already the foundations, everything had already been weakened,” he said. With the added blow of the earthquake, he said, ""We’ve had at least three or four hospitals that I know of that have been put out of service.""

            
                The powerful 7.8 magnitude quake that struck before dawn on Monday wreaked new damage and suffering in Syria’s last rebel-held enclave after years of fighting and bombardment. 

            Hospitals and clinics were flooded with injured people. The enclave, centered in Idlib province, houses millions of displaced Syrians who had fled their homes during the country’s civil war. Many of the displaced live in dire conditions in makeshift camps. Many others there and in neighboring government-held areas are housed in buildings weakened by past bombings, leaving them even more vulnerable to shocks from earthquakes.

            The quake caused total or partial damage to buildings in at least 58 villages, towns and cities in northwestern Syria, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor.

            More than 4,000 people were killed in Turkey and Syria, with the toll expected to climb. In the opposition-held territory in Syria, at least 450 were reported dead, but hundreds more were believed be buried under the rubble of their homes. 

            “This disaster will worsen the suffering of Syrians already struggling with a severe humanitarian crisis,” Carsten Hansen, the director for the Middle East at the Norwegian Refugee Council, said in a statement. “Millions have already been forced to flee by war in the wider region and now many more will be displaced by disaster.”

            In the hospital in Darkush in western Idlib, Abdel Hamid said his family were sleeping in their apartment when they were roused by powerful, prolonged shaking. They ran from the apartment, but “before we reached the door of the building, the whole building came down on us,” he said.

            A wooden door shielded them from the worst force of the collapse — they all got out alive. He and his wife and three of the children suffered head injuries, but are all in stable condition. 

            The scale of the casualties quickly overwhelmed the hospital’s resources, said Majdi al-Ibrahim, a general surgeon at the hospital.

            “We need urgent help. The danger is beyond our capacity,” he said.

            The Syrian American Medical Society, which runs hospitals in northern Syria and southern Turkey, said in a statement that its facilities are “overwhelmed with patients filling the hallways” and called urgently for “trauma supplies and a comprehensive emergency response to save lives and treat the injured.”

            The opposition territory in the northwest corner of Syria has held out for years even after Syrian government forces retook most rebel-held areas around the country. 

            Fighting still flares from time to time with Russian-backed Syrian forces nearby. Parts of the territory are run by rebel groups, including a dominant al-Qaida-linked militant faction, while parts are under a Turkish-backed administration known as the Syrian Interim Government.

            The disaster came on the heels of severe winter storms, further adding to the misery of those left without shelter. 

            “There is rain and the weather is very cold, there is snow in some of the areas,” Abdel Hakim al-Masri, economy minister with the Turkish-backed regional administration, told The Associated Press. He noted that some of the displacement camps in the area had been decimated by the quake. 

            Al-Masri said that efforts have begun to find temporary shelter for the people now doubly displaced by the earthquake, but that the magnitude of the response required is well beyond the local resources available.

            “There is a huge amount of suffering, and this will increase it,” he said. ""This matter calls for rapid action by all countries of the world.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802063,DeSantis expected to control Disney district governing board,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Gov. Ron DeSantis would take control over the board of a special governing district Walt Disney World operates in Florida under a bill introduced Monday, as the Republican governor punishes the company over its opposition to the so-called “Don't Say Gay” law. 

            Republican leaders in the statehouse, in coordination with DeSantis, have begun a special legislative session to restructure the Reedy Creek Improvement District, as the Disney government is known. 

            The proposal would largely leave the district and its abilities intact but change its name to the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District and require the governor to appoint a five-member oversight board. Members previously were named through entities controlled by Disney. 











            Lawmakers are also considering a proposal to create a state department focused on migrant transportation, after the governor flew a group of South American migrants from Texas to Massachusetts last year in protest of federal border policy.

            The session continues a focus by DeSantis focus on social issues including sexual orientation, gender and immigration as the Republican governor wades into political divides on his path to a potential 2024 presidential run.

            The meeting is the latest development in a high-profile feud between DeSantis and Disney over the company’s criticism of a law dubbed by critics as “Don’t Say Gay,” which bars instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through third grade and lessons deemed not age-appropriate.

            The governor, in going after Disney, displayed a willingness to penalize one of the state’s biggest employers and political donors, reinforcing the combative leadership style that has propelled him to national political stardom and appeals to conservative primary voters. 

            A spokeswoman for Reedy Creek did not immediately return an emailed request for comment. 

            In addition to Disney, DeSantis is using the special session to advance his national agenda on immigration and election fraud. 

            Lawmakers are expected to create the Unauthorized Alien Transport Program in the governor's administration to transport migrants within the country if they have been processed by the federal government.

            The legislation comes after DeSantis last year used part of a $12 million fund, paid for by taxpayers, to fly about 50 South American migrants from Texas to the Massachusetts resort island of Martha’s Vineyard, drawing widespread condemnation. 

            The flight also led to legal questions because the governor's office paid for the trip using money intended to transport migrants out of Florida, not Texas or any other state. The bill lawmakers will consider specifies that future flights could move migrants from anywhere in the U.S.

            Another proposal expected to pass during the session would enhance the ability of the statewide prosecutor to bring election crime charges, a move meant to strengthen the power of the governor's new election police force. 

            DeSantis last year pushed lawmakers to create a law enforcement unit focused on election crimes, addressing another concern of conservative voters after the 2020 election. But in the months since, some of the unit's charges have been dismissed by judges because of jurisdiction issues.

            The session is expected to deliver DeSantis a political victory in his fight against Disney, a squabble that began last year when the entertainment giant publicly opposed the “Don't Say Gay” law. The company said it would pause political donations in the state and support organizations working to oppose the law.

            DeSantis and other Republicans moved quickly to criticize Disney, calling it a purveyor of “woke” ideologies that are inappropriate for children.

            At DeSantis' request, the GOP-dominated statehouse in April approved legislation to eliminate Disney's Reedy Creek government by June 2023, beginning a closely watched process that would determine the structure of government that controls the company’s sprawling property. 

            The creation of the Reedy Creek district was instrumental in Disney’s decision to build near Orlando in the 1960s, when company leaders told the state they planned to build a futuristic city — the Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow, also known as Epcot.

            The proposed city was to include a rapid transit system and urban planning innovations, so Disney needed autonomy in the district for building and deciding how to use the land, they said. The futuristic city never materialized, and instead Epcot morphed into a second theme park that opened in 1982. 

            Having a separate government allows the Disney government to issue bonds and provide zoning, fire protection, utilities and infrastructure services on its land. Republican critics of the district argue it gives Disney a commercial advantage unavailable to others. 

            The special session will also adjust language in current laws addressing endorsement deals for college athletes.

            Florida was one of the first states to pass a law allowing college athletes to profit off their name, image or likeness, but it doesn’t allow people affiliated with universities to help secure endorsement deals. The proposal would lift that provision to make Florida more competitive with other states that don’t have the restriction.

            Lawmakers will also consider a bill to provide more relief money for Hurricane Ian and Nicole recovery efforts.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802067,Liz Weston: ‘Bridge’ your way to Social Security,"Delaying the start of Social Security benefits is a powerful way for retirees to cope with inflation, survive bad investment markets and reduce the risk they’ll run short of money. The advantages of waiting are so great that financial planners often recommend their clients tap other savings, such as retirement funds, to help them delay claiming.

            Employers could increase their workers’ financial security by offering a similar “bridge” strategy as part of 401(k)s and other workplace retirement plans, according to a study by the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. The bridge strategy would tap a worker’s retirement account to pay amounts roughly equal to the foregone Social Security checks.

            People can create such bridges on their own, of course. If Social Security projects your benefit at age 62 will be $1,500 a month, for example, you could set up automatic monthly withdrawals of that amount from your 401(k) at retirement. But having an employer offer the option could make the process easier and encourage more people to delay, says Gal Wettstein, the center’s senior research economist and co-author of the study.











            THE BENEFITS OF WAITING ARE HUGE

            Social Security benefits are incredibly valuable to retirees. Benefits are adjusted annually for inflation and, unlike retirement savings, can’t be depleted by bad markets, bad investing decisions or bad luck.

            People can claim Social Security retirement benefits at any time from ages 62 to 70. Starting before your full retirement age, which is currently between 66 and 67, typically means settling for a permanently reduced benefit. Delaying beyond full retirement age, by contrast, increases retirement benefits by 8% each year until your benefit maxes out at age 70.

            Waiting until age 70 can increase your Social Security checks by at least 76% compared to starting at 62, Wettstein says.

            “The higher monthly benefit means you have more guaranteed income, which will last you for the rest of your life,” Wettstein says.

            (By the way: Your Social Security benefits begin earning inflation adjustments starting at age 62, whether you’ve started receiving them or not, according to the Social Security Administration. So next year’s 8.7% cost of living increase is no reason to speed up your application if you’re able to hold off.)

            MOST PEOPLE ARE STILL CLAIMING TOO EARLY

            Copious research has shown that most people are better off waiting to claim Social Security. It’s particularly important for the higher earner in a married couple to delay, since that benefit determines what the survivor gets after the first spouse dies.

            A study by economists from the Federal Reserve and Boston University found that “virtually all” U.S. workers ages 45 to 62 should wait beyond age 65 to claim, and 90% should wait until age 70, although only about 10% currently do. Claiming too early will cost the typical worker over $182,000 in lifetime discretionary spending, the economists found.

            The average claiming age inched up between 2008 and 2018, from 63.6 to 64.7 for men and from 63.6 to 64.6 for women, according to the Social Security Administration. Most people still claim their benefits before reaching their full retirement age, which means their benefits are permanently reduced.

            FEW RETIREMENT PLANS HELP WITH PAYOUT STRATEGIES

            Many employers provide matches to encourage people to accumulate money for retirement, but few help with payout strategies when it’s time to retire, Wettstein notes. A few offer the option to annuitize, which means turning some or all of the account balance over to an insurance company in exchange for a guaranteed stream of payments.

            Most people don’t much like the idea of giving up big chunks of their savings, Wettstein notes. His study presented an alternative — the employer-provided bridge — to a nationally representative sample of 1,349 people ages 50 to 65 who had not retired and who had at least $25,000 in their 401(k). The strategy would allow participants to use up to half of their retirement account balances to replace Social Security checks while they delayed claiming.

            A “substantial minority” said they would use the strategy if offered, the researchers found. About 27% of those who were given a brief description of how it worked said they would use it. The percentage willing to use the strategy rose as participants were given more information, with 35% of those given the most complete explanation saying they would use it. In addition, 31% said they wouldn’t opt out if their employer made the bridge strategy the default option.

            Wettstein says to his knowledge no employers are currently offering a bridge strategy, but he hopes the research will spur some to consider it. Figuring out when to claim Social Security is daunting enough for the average worker, let alone deciding how and when to tap retirement funds, he says. An employer-provided bridge strategy could make waiting easier for many.

            “If it’s all set out for you in a way that is effortless, that is definitely attractive,” Wettstein says.

            The nationally representative survey of 1,349 respondents was conducted online in July 2021 by the NORC at the University of Chicago. Participants were ages 50-65, not retired, and had balances of at least $25,000 in their 401(k).

            NerdWallet: 8 ways to increase Social Security benefits https://bit.ly/nerdwallet-increase-social-security-benefitsDelaying the start of Social Security benefits is a powerful way for retirees to cope with inflation, survive bad investment markets and reduce the risk they’ll run short of money. The advantages of waiting are so great that financial planners often recommend their clients tap other savings, such as retirement funds, to help them delay claiming.Employers could increase their workers’ financial security by offering a similar “bridge” strategy as part of 401(k)s and other workplace retirement plans, according to a study by the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. The bridge strategy would tap a worker’s retirement account to pay amounts roughly equal to the foregone Social Security checks.People can create such bridges on their own, of course. If Social Security projects your benefit at age 62 will be $1,500 a month, for example, you could set up automatic monthly withdrawals of that amount from your 401(k) at retirement. But having an employer offer the option could make the process easier and encourage more people to delay, says Gal Wettstein, the center’s senior research economist and co-author of the study.THE BENEFITS OF WAITING ARE HUGESocial Security benefits are incredibly valuable to retirees. Benefits are adjusted annually for inflation and, unlike retirement savings, can’t be depleted by bad markets, bad investing decisions or bad luck.People can claim Social Security retirement benefits at any time from ages 62 to 70. Starting before your full retirement age, which is currently between 66 and 67, typically means settling for a permanently reduced benefit. Delaying beyond full retirement age, by contrast, increases retirement benefits by 8% each year until your benefit maxes out at age 70.Waiting until age 70 can increase your Social Security checks by at least 76% compared to starting at 62, Wettstein says.“The higher monthly benefit means you have more guaranteed income, which will last you for the rest of your life,” Wettstein says.(By the way: Your Social Security benefits begin earning inflation adjustments starting at age 62, whether you’ve started receiving them or not, according to the Social Security Administration. So next year’s 8.7% cost of living increase is no reason to speed up your application if you’re able to hold off.)MOST PEOPLE ARE STILL CLAIMING TOO EARLYCopious research has shown that most people are better off waiting to claim Social Security. It’s particularly important for the higher earner in a married couple to delay, since that benefit determines what the survivor gets after the first spouse dies.A study by economists from the Federal Reserve and Boston University found that “virtually all” U.S. workers ages 45 to 62 should wait beyond age 65 to claim, and 90% should wait until age 70, although only about 10% currently do. Claiming too early will cost the typical worker over $182,000 in lifetime discretionary spending, the economists found.The average claiming age inched up between 2008 and 2018, from 63.6 to 64.7 for men and from 63.6 to 64.6 for women, according to the Social Security Administration. Most people still claim their benefits before reaching their full retirement age, which means their benefits are permanently reduced.FEW RETIREMENT PLANS HELP WITH PAYOUT STRATEGIESMany employers provide matches to encourage people to accumulate money for retirement, but few help with payout strategies when it’s time to retire, Wettstein notes. A few offer the option to annuitize, which means turning some or all of the account balance over to an insurance company in exchange for a guaranteed stream of payments.Most people don’t much like the idea of giving up big chunks of their savings, Wettstein notes. His study presented an alternative — the employer-provided bridge — to a nationally representative sample of 1,349 people ages 50 to 65 who had not retired and who had at least $25,000 in their 401(k). The strategy would allow participants to use up to half of their retirement account balances to replace Social Security checks while they delayed claiming.A “substantial minority” said they would use the strategy if offered, the researchers found. About 27% of those who were given a brief description of how it worked said they would use it. The percentage willing to use the strategy rose as participants were given more information, with 35% of those given the most complete explanation saying they would use it. In addition, 31% said they wouldn’t opt out if their employer made the bridge strategy the default option.Wettstein says to his knowledge no employers are currently offering a bridge strategy, but he hopes the research will spur some to consider it. Figuring out when to claim Social Security is daunting enough for the average worker, let alone deciding how and when to tap retirement funds, he says. An employer-provided bridge strategy could make waiting easier for many.“If it’s all set out for you in a way that is effortless, that is definitely attractive,” Wettstein says.The nationally representative survey of 1,349 respondents was conducted online in July 2021 by the NORC at the University of Chicago.

            Today is Thursday, Feb. 16, the 47th day of 2023. There are 318 days left in the year. 

            Today’s Highlight in History:











            On Feb. 16, 1959, Fidel Castro became premier of Cuba a month and a-half after the overthrow of Fulgencio Batista.

            On this date:

            In 1862, the Civil War Battle of Fort Donelson in Tennessee ended as some 12,000 Confederate soldiers surrendered; Union Gen. Ulysses S. Grant’s victory earned him the moniker “Unconditional Surrender Grant.”

            In 1918, Lithuania proclaimed its independence from the Russian Empire. (Lithuania, which was occupied by the Soviet Union, then Nazi Germany, then the Soviet Union again during World War II, renewed its independence in 1990).

            In 1923, the burial chamber of King Tutankhamen’s recently unearthed tomb was unsealed in Egypt by English archaeologist Howard Carter.

            In 1945, American troops landed on the island of Corregidor in the Philippines during World War II.

            In 1960, the nuclear-powered radar picket submarine USS Triton departed New London, Connecticut, on the first submerged circumnavigation by a vessel.

            In 1961, the United States launched the Explorer 9 satellite.

            In 1996, eleven people were killed in a fiery collision between an Amtrak passenger train and a Maryland commuter train in Silver Spring, Maryland.

            In 1998, a China Airlines Airbus A300 trying to land in fog near Taipei, Taiwan, crashed, killing all 196 people on board, plus seven on the ground.

            In 2001, the United States and Britain staged air strikes against radar stations and air defense command centers in Iraq.

            In 2009, in Stamford, Connecticut, a 200-pound chimpanzee named Travis went berserk, severely mauling its owner’s friend, Charla Nash; Travis was shot dead by police.

            In 2011, bookstore chain Borders filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and said it would close nearly a third of its stores. (Borders closed all of its remaining stores in September 2011.)

            Ten years ago: Gunmen attacked a camp for a construction company in rural northern Nigeria, killing a guard and kidnapping seven workers from Lebanon, Britain, Greece and Italy; the kidnappers later claimed to have killed the hostages. Billy Hunter was ousted as executive director of the National Basketball Players Association by NBA players. Tony Sheridan, 72, a British singer who performed with the Beatles during their early years in Germany, died in Hamburg.

            Five years ago: In an indictment, special counsel Robert Mueller accused 13 Russians of an elaborate plot to disrupt the 2016 U.S. presidential election with a huge but hidden social media trolling campaign aimed in part at helping Donald Trump. The FBI said it had received a tip in January that the suspect in the Parkland, Florida school shooting had a “desire to kill” and access to guns, but agents failed to investigate. Former presidential hopeful Mitt Romney officially launched his political comeback attempt, announcing that he was running for a Utah Senate seat. (Romney would be elected in November, handily defeating Democrat Jenny Wilson.) 

            One year ago: Ukrainians defied pressure from Moscow with a national show of flag-waving unity, while the West warned that it saw no sign of a promised pullback of Russian troops from Ukraine’s borders despite Kremlin declarations of a withdrawal. (Russia would invade Ukraine four days later.) The Catholic Church said baptisms performed by a priest who served in Arizona for 16 years are now presumed to be invalid because he used incorrect wording on a subtle but key component of the sacrament. 

            Today’s birthdays: Jazz/pop singer-actor Peggy King is 93. Actor William Katt is 72. Actor LeVar Burton is 66. Actor-rapper Ice-T is 65. International Tennis Hall of Famer John McEnroe is 64. Rock musician Andy Taylor is 62. Rock musician Dave Lombardo (Slayer) is 58. Actor Sarah Clarke is 52.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802069,Media watchdog urges release of journalist detained in Kabul,"PARIS (AP) — 

            Media watchdog Reporters Without Borders along with 14 French media outlets and production companies on Monday called on Afghanistan’s Taliban rulers to release a journalist imprisoned for a month in Kabul.

            In a joint statement, RSF and French media said journalist Mortaza Behboudi, with dual French and Afghan citizenship, was arrested on Jan. 7 in the Afghan capital, two days after he arrived in the country as part of a reporting assignment. They said they decided to make the case public after trying in vain for a month to obtain his release. 











            RSF and French media called on Taliban authorities “to end this senseless situation” and that the “respected and appreciated” journalist was said to be “accused of spying.”

            According to the statement, Behboudi, 28, began his career as a photojournalist at the age of 16 in Afghanistan, where he was born. He came as a refugee to Paris at 21 because he had been threatened in his home country and later worked as a freelance journalist for numerous French media.

            Behboudi was awarded the Bayeux Prize for War Correspondents last year for a series of reports about life in Afghanistan under the Taliban regime.PARIS (AP) —Media watchdog Reporters Without Borders along with 14 French media outlets and production companies on Monday called on Afghanistan’s Taliban rulers to release a journalist imprisoned for a month in Kabul.In a joint statement, RSF and French media said journalist Mortaza Behboudi, with dual French and Afghan citizenship, was arrested on Jan. 7 in the Afghan capital, two days after he arrived in the country as part of a reporting assignment.

            Today is Saturday, Feb. 18, the 49th day of 2023. There are 316 days left in the year. 

            Today’s Highlight in History: 











            On Feb. 18, 2001, auto racing star Dale Earnhardt Sr. died in a crash at the Daytona 500; he was 49.

            On this date: 

            In 1564, Michelangelo died in Rome at age 88.

            In 1885, Mark Twain’s “Adventures of Huckleberry Finn” was published in the U.S. for the first time (after being published in Britain and Canada).

            In 1970, the “Chicago Seven” defendants were found not guilty of conspiring to incite riots at the 1968 Democratic national convention; five were convicted of violating the Anti-Riot Act of 1968 (those convictions were later reversed).

            In 1983, 13 people were shot to death at a gambling club in Seattle’s Chinatown in what became known as the Wah Mee Massacre. (Two men were convicted of the killings and were sentenced to life in prison; a third was found guilty of robbery and assault.)

            In 1984, Italy and the Vatican signed an accord under which Roman Catholicism ceased to be the state religion of Italy.

            In 1988, Anthony M. Kennedy was sworn in as an associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.

            In 1994, at the Winter Olympic Games in Norway, U.S. speedskater Dan Jansen finally won a gold medal, breaking the world record in the 1,000 meters.

            In 2001, veteran FBI agent Robert Philip Hanssen was arrested, accused of spying for Russia. (Hanssen later pleaded guilty to espionage and attempted espionage and was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.)

            In 2003, an arson attack involving two South Korean subway trains in the city of Daegu claimed 198 lives. (The arsonist was sentenced to life in prison, where he died in 2004.)

            In 2016, in what was seen as a criticism of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, Pope Francis said that a person who advocated building walls was “not Christian”; Trump quickly retorted it was “disgraceful” to question a person’s faith. (A Vatican spokesman said the next day that the pope’s comment was not intended as a “personal attack” on Trump.)

            In 2020, President Donald Trump commuted the 14-year prison sentence of former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich for political corruption; Blagojevich left prison hours later and returned home to Chicago. (Trump also issued pardons or clemency to former New York City police commissioner Bernard Kerik, financier Michael Milken and a long list of others.)

            Ten years ago: The European Union imposed trade and economic sanctions on North Korea while condemning “in the strongest terms” the nation’s latest nuclear test. Robbers stole a reported $50 million worth of diamonds from the hold of a Swiss-bound plane at Brussels’ international airport; more than 30 people were later detained and some of the loot recovered. President Hugo Chavez returned to Venezuela after more than two months of treatment in Cuba following cancer surgery. 

            Five years ago: “Black Panther,” the Marvel superhero film from the Walt Disney Co., blew past expectations to take in $192 million during its debut weekend in U.S. and Canadian theaters. LeBron James scored 29 points and won his third NBA All-Star Game MVP award as his team beat the rival squad headed by Stephen Curry, 148-to-145. 

            One year ago: Spiking tensions in eastern Ukraine aggravated Western fears of a Russian invasion and a new war in Europe, with a humanitarian convoy hit by shelling and pro-Russian rebels evacuating civilians from the conflict zone. (Russia would invade Ukraine two days later.) Police arrested scores of demonstrators and towed away vehicles in Canada’s besieged capital, and a stream of trucks started leaving under the pressure, raising authorities’ hopes for an end to the three-week protest against the country’s COVID-19 restrictions

            Poland is taking additional steps to strengthen its defensive capabilities as Russia’s war in neighboring Ukraine enters its second year later this month. 

            At least three ground-to-air missile launchers were seen Monday at Warsaw’s Bemowo airport. 











            Defense Minister Mariusz Blaszczak said on Twitter over the weekend that the redeployment of the missile batteries from their base in Sochaczew, central Poland, to Warsaw was “an important element to the training"" of the 3rd Warsaw Brigade of Missile Air Defense.

            The Patriot batteries are part of Poland’s multibillion dollar armaments purchases from the U.S., South Korea and elsewhere.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802079,"National Enquirer, caught in 'catch-and-kill' scandal, sold","The National Enquirer, the scandal-plagued tabloid that engaged in “catch-and-kill” practices to bury stories about Donald Trump during his presidential campaign, has been sold.

            VVIP is buying the National Examiner and another tabloid, the Globe, from magazine publisher a360 Media in an all-cash deal, though exact financial terms were not disclosed.

            In December 2018 the parent company of publications including the National Enquirer, Us Weekly and In Touch admitted to engaging in a journalistically dubious practice known as “catch-and-kill”  in order to help Donald Trump become president.











            Federal prosecutors revealed at the time that they had agreed not to prosecute American Media Inc. for secretly assisting Trump’s campaign by paying $150,000 to Playboy model Karen McDougal for the rights to her story about an alleged affair with Trump. The company then intentionally suppressed McDougal’s story until after the election.

            
                Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, also accused the paper of attempting to bribe him in 2019 with embarrassing “below the belt” photos sent to his girlfriend. 

            American Media sold the National Enquirer and some other publications in April 2019 to James Cohen, former head of the airport newsstand company Hudson News. However, the transaction was never completed. 

            In August 2020 David Pecker stepped down as CEO of American Media. At the time, American Media Inc. was being taken over by Accelerate360, a logistics firm based in Smyrna, Georgia. Under Pecker, the National Enquirer for years buried potentially embarrassing stories about Trump and other favored celebrities by buying the rights to them and never publishing. 

            The Federal Election Commission fined a360 Media $187,500 in June 2021 for squashing the McDougal story. The FEC said the publisher’s “payment to Karen McDougal to purchase a limited life story right combined with its decision not to publish the story, in consultation with an agent of Donald J. Trump and for the purpose of influencing the election, constituted a prohibited corporate in-kind contribution.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802090,"For Super Bowl ads this year, crypto is out, booze is in","NEW YORK (AP) — The hottest ticket in town for advertisers is officially sold out. Fox said Monday that in-game ads for Super Bowl LVII have all been sold. 

            
                The big game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles takes place on Sunday.

            The Super Bowl is advertising's biggest stage, with advertisers jockeying to get their products in front of the more than 100 million people that watch each year. Mark Evans, executive vice president of ad sales for Fox Sports, said a few ads went for more than $7 million for a 30-second spot. Most sold between $6 million and $7 million.











            Anheuser-Busch remains the biggest advertiser with three minutes of national airtime. The beverage giant gave up its deal to be the exclusive alcohol advertiser this year, so Heineken, Diageo, Remy Martin and Molson Coors are also in the game. Other big categories advertising include packaged food like Doritos and M&Ms, movie studios and streaming services, automakers and tech companies, Evans said. Out this year: crypto companies.

            Last year's Super Bowl was dubbed the “Crypto Bowl” because four cryptocurrency companies — FTX, Coinbase, Crypto.com and eToro — ran splashy commercials. It was part of a larger effort by crypto companies to break into the mainstream with sports sponsorships. But in November, FTX filed for bankruptcy and its founder was charged in a scheme to defraud investors. 

            This year, two crypto advertisers had commercials “booked and done"" and two others were ”on the one-yard line,"" Evans said. But once FTX news broke, those deals weren't completed. 

            Now, ""There's zero representation in that category on the day at all,” he said.

            Evans said most Super Bowl ads sold much earlier than usual, with more than 90% of its Super Bowl ad inventory gone by the end of the summer, as established advertisers jockeyed for prime positions. But the remaining spots sold slower. Partly that was due to the implosion of the crypto space, as well as general advertiser concerns about the global economy, Evans said.

            Last year, NBC sold out of its ad space briskly and said an undisclosed number of 30-second spots went for $7 million, a jump from the $6.5 million that 2021’s ads went for.NEW YORK (AP) — The hottest ticket in town for advertisers is officially sold out.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802091,Strongest earthquake in decades startles western New York,"BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) — A small earthquake rumbled through western New York early Monday, alarming people in a region unaccustomed to such shaking but apparently causing no significant damage. 

            The U.S. Geological Survey preliminarily reported a 3.8 earthquake centered east of Buffalo in the suburb of West Seneca at about 6:15 a.m. Seismologist Yaareb Altaweel said it matched the intensity of the strongest earthquake the region has seen in 40 years of available records — a 3.8 quake that was recorded in November 1999.

            The shaking lasted a few seconds and sent residents first to their windows and then to social media in search of an explanation.











            “It felt like a car hit my house in Buffalo. I jumped out of bed,” Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz tweeted. County emergency services officials confirmed the earthquake was felt in at least a 30-mile radius, including in Niagara Falls, about 20 miles north of Buffalo, he said.

            
                Earthquake Canada, which measured a 4.2 magnitude event, reported it was felt slightly in southern Ontario. 

            City and county crews spent part of the day inspecting bridges and roads in New York, finding no immediate damage, officials said.

            “Fortunately, we have no earthquake related injuries either —and I pray that remains the case,” Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown said in a statement. 

            Small earthquakes are not unusual in upstate New York but are rarely felt as strongly. The quake offered a reminder, Brown said, that the region is on a significant fault line known as the Clarendon-Linden fault system.

            The earthquake comes on the heels of two record-breaking weather events in the region: A snowstorm that dropped as much as 7 feet of snow in November and a blizzard in December that is blamed for 47 deaths.

            The earthquake occurred hours after a powerful quake killed hundreds in Turkey and Syria. A USGS spokesperson said there is no connection between the two events.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802100,"Spanish PM urges end to EU reliance on imported food, energy","MADRID (AP) — Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez on Monday urged the European Union to “reindustrialize” to end its reliance on energy, microchips and food from outside the bloc and to learn the lessons of shortages provoked by the COVID-19 pandemic and war in Ukraine.

            Shortages triggered by dependence on countries outside the 27-nation EU highlighted “a serious threat to the competitiveness of our companies or to the security and welfare of our fellow citizens,” Sánchez said. 

            He pointed to microchips and personal protective equipment from Asia during the pandemic and Russian natural gas and grains during the war in Ukraine. Sánchez was giving a speech in Madrid to outline policy priorities before Spain assumes the rotating presidency of the EU council in the second half of 2023.











            The solution, he added, was to “reindustrialize Europe"" and “recover jobs and strategic capabilities that we should never have lost.” The focus would not be on traditional heavy manufacturing but “digitalization or ecological transition,” said Sánchez, noting that just 1% of solar panels were made in the EU or 20% of internet storage used by the bloc.

            Sánchez also announced that a joint research project with 25 EU countries would analyze the “strategic vulnerabilities” of the bloc's energy, food, health and technology supply chains.

            The EU has proposed simplifying subsidies for green industries and awarding funding for Europe-wide projects as the bloc pursues the goal of being climate neutral by 2050.

            Spain's inflation rate is one of the lowest in Europe, partly due to its low reliance on Russian natural gas, and the Spanish economy grew more than expected in the final quarter of last year.MADRID (AP) — Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez on Monday urged the European Union to “reindustrialize” to end its reliance on energy, microchips and food from outside the bloc and to learn the lessons of shortages provoked by the COVID-19 pandemic and war in Ukraine.Shortages triggered by dependence on countries outside the 27-nation EU highlighted “a serious threat to the competitiveness of our companies or to the security and welfare of our fellow citizens,” Sánchez said.He pointed to microchips and personal protective equipment from Asia during the pandemic and Russian natural gas and grains during the war in Ukraine.

            Chua said in a statement released Monday by St. Martin's Publishing Group that she drew upon memories of growing up in El Cerrito, across the bay from “glamorous San Francisco.”

            “As the daughter of immigrants who was often teased about my Chinese accent, slanty eyes, and funny clothes, I was acutely conscious of the gap between insiders and outsiders, haves and have-nots, in a state shaped by constant waves of migration and the lure of a better life,” Chua said. 











            “I wove my story around actual events, like the Japanese American internment, labor unrest in the shipyards where America’s battleships were built, and the christening of the Golden Gate Bridge, as well as colorful real-life characters like Madame Chiang Kai-Shek and forensic pioneer August Vollmer of the Berkeley Police Department.”

            Chua, 60, has been controversial as an author and academic. “Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother,” a memoir published in 2011, launched an extended debate over parenting as she described her admittedly harsh approach to raising her two daughters. Chua and her husband, the author and fellow Yale Law professor Jed Rubenfeld, have faced allegations of inappropriate conduct while hosting parties for students at their home.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802137,Insider Q&A: Lone Star Credit Union CEO on cryptocurrencies,"NEW YORK (AP) — Credit unions have been dipping their toes into cryptocurrency over the past year. The timing largely coincided with the “crypto winter” that saw digital coins plunge in value and numerous exchanges and lenders collapse. 

            But at the height of the crypto craze in late 2021, many credit unions saw their members buying cryptocurrency in significant numbers. In December 2021, the National Credit Union Administration, the federal agency that regulates credit unions, released guidance clarifying that federally insured credit unions can partner with third-party providers to allow their members to buy, sell and hold cryptocurrencies.

            Lone Star Credit Union, a small Dallas credit union with $163 million in assets, refers members interested in buying cryptocurrency to BankSocial, a non-custodial wallet provider, which gives buyers control over access to their assets. 











            In an interview with The Associated Press, Lone Star Credit Union CEO Becky Reed discusses the partnership and why she is optimistic about crypto's future. 

            Q: What was behind Lone Star's decision to enter the crypto market? 

            A: It was in late 2021 and early 2022 that we noticed that our members were buying crypto. At that point in time, we really thought that our members weren't. If you asked our executive team and our board they would say, 'Well, our members don't care about cryptocurrencies.' Well, the data showed otherwise.

            Q: What did the data show?

            A: There is a popular notion that wealthy people are buying a bunch of crypto and holding it and selling it and making a lot of money. But the truth is what we saw was people buying it similar to what they would buy with stocks like on E-Trade or something. Every time they got a paycheck, they would buy $100.

            Q: Has that trend changed with the downturn of cryptocurrencies? 

            A: Now it has dramatically decreased. Now it’s like the die-hard people. Maybe 10% of the people who were buying it are still buying it. So we've seen it greatly reduced in both volume and how often.

            Q: So where do you see cryptocurrency going?

            A: A lot of the hype that was happening in the early part of 2022 in particular, caused a lot of fear of missing out, FOMO. And so I think that people potentially got into the space because of that without really understanding what it is that they were getting into. And I think that there certainly was a misunderstanding of custodianship. You know, who actually owns the crypto in your wallet ... But now that some of the negative things have happened in this space, a lot of that fear of missing out went away. And now the real use cases and the real builders in this space kind of have a runway to do things in a regulated and compliant way. I believe that distributed ledger technology, which includes cryptocurrency but is not limited to cryptocurrency, is the future of finance.

            Q: What was the advantage of partnering with a non-custodial wallet provider? 

            A: When you really look at the reason crypto was created, it was created for self-custody .... Our members were buying it anyway and in some cases were buying it from unscrupulous exchanges that were some place that wasn’t very regulated, highly regulated. So, BankSocial follows the regulations here in the United States. It's self-custody. Self-custody was something that was important and we figured, well, let’s refer it.

            Q: Does Lone Star offer any kind of financial advice about crypto? 

            A: In no way are we recommending that people go out and buy crypto. If you choose to do that, we recommend BankSocial, but it’s really around, you know, this is not an investment product, it’s not insured, and it has a high amount of volatility and risk. And we at Lone Star are not giving you any advice as to what you should buy.NEW YORK (AP) — Credit unions have been dipping their toes into cryptocurrency over the past year.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802139,German women's soccer shows more investment as crowds grow,"FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — German women's soccer clubs posted record revenue and losses in a report out Monday, reflecting heavier investment into the game even before the national team's run to the final of the European Championship last year brought a dramatic increase in spectator numbers. 

            The report by the German soccer federation covers the 2021-22 season, before the European Championship, and shows the 12 clubs in the top-division Frauen-Bundesliga averaged around 1.42 million euros ($1.53 million) in revenue. 

            Expenses averaged 2.94 million euros ($3.16 million), driven in part by higher wage costs, meaning average overall losses of around 1.52 million ($1.64 million) per team.











            The bulk of the losses were made by teams attached to clubs which also run men's professional teams. Those clubs often cross-finance their women's soccer operations with income from the wider organization. Teams are investing for the future and there is no indication the league is in financial jeopardy, the federation said. 

            Bayern Munich and Wolfsburg have taken the lead in German women's soccer in recent years during a push to professionalize the league. As the transfer market worldwide has grown, they've faced extra competition to sign top players to keep up with Champions League rivals from England, Spain and France. 

            Since the European Championship, which had widespread TV coverage not seen for previous continental tournaments, attendances have more than tripled this season to around 3,000 per game, up from 806 in 2021-22, with Wolfsburg leading the way at over 7,700.

Andrews and Walton Hamilton thought of the book during the first year of the pandemic, when they learned of “Concert for the Biocene,” in which a string quartet played in front of thousands — of plants, one for each seat at Barcelona's Gran Teatre del Liceu.

            “The Enchanted Symphony” is a “hopeful fairy tale,” according to Abrams. It's set in a village “beset by a mysterious fog,” but revived by a “boy's simple melody.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802142,Crews release toxic chemicals from derailed tankers in Ohio,"EAST PALESTINE, Ohio (AP) — Crews released toxic chemicals into the air from five derailed tanker cars that were in danger of exploding Monday and began burning it after warning residents near the Ohio-Pennsylvania state line to leave immediately or face the possibility of death.

            Flames and black smoke billowed high into the sky from the derailment site late in the afternoon, about an hour after authorities said the controlled release would begin. 

            The slow release of vinyl chloride from five rail cars into a trough that was then ignited created a large plume above the village of East Palestine but authorities said they were closely monitoring the air quality.











            “Thus far, no concerning readings have been detected,"" Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said at a brief evening news conference about three hours after the venting and burning procedure began.

            However, he urged Pennsylvania residents within a 2-mile (3.2 kilometer) radius of the derailment site to shelter in place and keep their doors and windows closed through the evening as a precaution in case of wind shifts.

            Shapiro also said he had spoken to President Joe Biden, who had offered “the full support of the federal government"" to Pennsylvania and Ohio.

            Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine earlier ordered evacuations in the area of the derailment that has been smoldering since Friday night. Authorities believed most, if not all, residents in the danger zone had left but they were knocking on doors one more time before releasing the vinyl chloride inside the cars, he said. 

            “You need to leave, you just need to leave. This is a matter of life and death,” DeWine said at news conference.

            Officials warned the controlled burn would send phosgene and hydrogen chloride into the air. Phosgene is a highly toxic gas that can cause vomiting and breathing trouble and was used as a weapon in World War I. 

            Scott Deutsch of Norfolk Southern Railway earlier said doing this during the daytime would allow the fumes to disperse more quickly and prevent the rail cars from exploding and sending shrapnel and other debris from flying through the neighborhood.

            “We can't control where that goes,” he said. 

            The process involves using a small charge to blow a hole in the cars, allowing the material to go into a trench and burning it off before it's released in the air, he said. The crews handling the controlled release have done this safely before, Deutsch said. 

            About three hours into the procedure, Norfolk Southern Railway issued a statement saying that experts and first responders had breached the rail cars, chemicals were burning off and the cars were expected to drain for several more hours.

            The site is very close to the state line, and the evacuation area extends into a sparsely populated area of Pennsylvania. About half of the 4,800 residents in East Palestine had been warned to leave over the weekend before officials decided on Monday to use the controlled release. 

            Shapiro said the evacuation zone includes about 20 Pennsylvania residences. Pennsylvania State Police went door-to-door to assist the last remaining residents and ensure they leave.

            Shapiro later said he’d been told that residents with a mile (1.6 kilometers) of the controlled burn had left.

            Forced evacuations began Sunday night in East Palestine after authorities became alarmed that the rail cars could explode after a “drastic temperature change” was observed in a rail car.

            Residents were packing overnight bags, loading their pets into cars and searching for hotel rooms Monday morning. Police in the village moved out of their communication center as the threat of an explosion increased. 

            Police cars, snow plows and military vehicles from the Ohio National Guard blocked streets leading into the area.

            About 50 cars, including 10 carrying hazardous materials, derailed in a fiery crash Friday night, according to rail operator Norfolk Southern and the National Transportation Safety Board. No injuries to crew, residents or first responders were reported.

            Five were transporting vinyl chloride, which is used to make the polyvinyl chloride hard plastic resin in plastic products and is associated with increased risk of liver cancer and other cancers, according to the federal government’s National Cancer Institute

            Federal investigators say the cause of the derailment was a mechanical issue with a rail car axle. 

            The three-member train crew received an alert about the mechanical defect “shortly before the derailment,"" Michael Graham, a board member of the NTSB, said Sunday. Investigators identified the exact “point of derailment,” but the board was still working to determine which rail car experienced the axle issue, he said.

            Mayor Trent Conaway, who declared a state of emergency in the village, said one person was arrested for going around barricades right up to the crash. He warned people to stay away and said they'd risk arrest. 

            “I don't know why anybody would want to be up there; you're breathing toxic fumes if you're that close,” he said.

Investigators identified the exact “point of derailment,” but the board was still working to determine which rail car experienced the axle issue, he said.Mayor Trent Conaway, who declared a state of emergency in the village, said one person was arrested for going around barricades right up to the crash. He warned people to stay away and said they'd risk arrest.“I don't know why anybody would want to be up there; you're breathing toxic fumes if you're that close,” he said.___Seewer reported from Toledo, Ohio.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802155,Why is Turkey an earthquake hot spot?,"More than 1,000 people died and many more were injured in the massive earthquakes that struck Turkey and Syria on Monday. The number of victims is expected to rise. Aid workers are working to rescue people from the rubble, but they have to contend with adverse weather conditions. Temperatures in the affected areas frequently dip below freezing, and some affected areas have seen heavy snowfall.The epicenter of the 7.4-magnitude quake was located in the province of Kahramanmaras near the Syrian border, according to Turkey's Afad disaster management agency. Another 6.6-magnitude earthquake was measured shortly after in Gaziantep province, Afad said.Earthquakes are not uncommon in Turkey and other regions of the world. But why? It's important to know that the Earth's crust is a kind of puzzle ― albeit a dynamic one that consists of many individual pieces: A few gigantic oceanic plates and several small continental crustal plates. The science isn't conclusive on exactly how many.Scientists know that these plates move a couple centimeters each year. They can move away from each other, toward each other or sometimes up against each other, causing the continent above them to move. These movements are called plate tectonics.In October 2020, an earthquake shook the Aegean Sea. The epicenter was located off the province of Izmir near the surface of the sea. More than 100 people died and over 1,000 others were injured.Turkey has long been of particular interest to earthquake researchers. The German Research Center for Geosciences (GFZ) in Potsdam installed measuring equipment in Turkey and has been conducting seismic monitoring in the country since the 1980s. GFZ records show that the earthquake risk is very high throughout the region around the Sea of Marmara, for example, where Istanbul lies.""The question is not whether an earthquake will come. The question is when it will come,"" Marco Bohnhoff, a seismologist at GFZ and an expert on the region, said in 2019.Bohnhoff and other experts base this estimate on the occurrence of several strong earthquakes throughout Istanbul's history, the ongoing continental drift beneath the Sea of Marmara and an the existence of an area of the earthquake zone located just outside Istanbul that has long been suspiciously quiet.Bohnhoff said that there was a lot of evidence suggesting that the plates in this area were ""snagged,"" causing tension to build up. Eventually, he suggested, the rock would not be able to withstand the tension anymore and the plates pushing against each other would move in a jolt of several meters in a matter of seconds.The real danger to buildings, infrastructure and the local population is posed by the earthquake-waves in which the ground moves. How much damage they do depends on how strong the earthquake is.A good way to keep people safe is earthquake-resistant construction. Unfortunately, this is very expensive, Bohnhoff said, adding that builders have to ask themselves whether to retrofit old buildings or tear them down and start from scratch.During the quakes in the Turkish-Syrian border region on Monday morning, more than 1,700 buildings are said to have collapsed in Turkey alone.But it's not just a building's bones that play a significant role in whether it can withstand an earthquake ― the ground on which it is built matters, too. As a general rule, the firmer the better, Bohnhoff said: ""It is best if the subsoil is granite. Dry-laid sediments such as sand or clay are less preferable.""On soft bedrock, he said, ground motion amplification is more likely to occur, sometimes along with what is called liquefaction. The seismologist compared this process to what happens with wet sand on a beach. If you repeatedly tap the same spot in the sand, water collects in the pit.""Then the subsurface becomes unstable,"" he said.Editor's note: An earlier version of this article appeared in German on November 2, 2020.",2023/2/6,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802156,How Hong Kong's national security trial is testing judicial independence,"Hong Kong's landmark national security trial involving 47 pro-democracy politicians and activists began Monday — almost two years after their arrests.All of them have been charged with subversion for participating in an unofficial primary held in 2020, as they tried to win a majority in the city's Legislative Council at the time.Prosecutors accused them of attempting to paralyze the government and overthrow Hong Kong's chief executive through a ""massive and well-organized"" plan that involved blocking legislation and vetoing government budgets.Among the accused are veteran pro-democracy politician Claudia Mo, legal scholar Benny Tai, former journalist Gwyneth Ho and prominent activist Joshua Wong.Dennis Kwok, a former opposition legislator in Hong Kong who is now a senior fellow at Harvard University, said his former colleagues are being charged for allegedly having promised to ""use their power as legislators if elected, to force the Hong Kong government to answer to the demands of the people, and otherwise, they would veto important government budget or bills.""Kwok told DW they are ""being penalized as members of the opposition for criticizing the government.""Sunny Cheung, an exiled Hong Kong activist who was among those who participated in the unofficial primary in 2020, told DW that the international community ""should observe how the Hong Kong regime tries to frame all the defendants who joined the primary.""Since the imposition of the National Security Law (NSL) in the summer of 2020, after months of anti-government protests in Hong Kong, the semi-autonomous city has undergone dramatic changes. Hundreds of pro-democracy politicians, activists and Hong Kong citizens have been arrested.Local authorities have also launched an overhaul of the electoral system by implementing vetting mechanisms that emphasize the principle of ""patriots rule Hong Kong.""Chung Ching Kwong, the Hong Kong Campaigns coordinator for the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China (IPAC), told DW that the prosecutors ""are not providing any concrete proof that they (the defendants) were really trying to subvert the state.""Most of the defendants have been detained for over two years — a significant indicator that authorities are trying to keep them ""out of the public's eyes,"" Kwong said.""By putting these defendants behind bars for years, they can't effectively communicate with the public or they have limited access to information or the public has limited access to them,"" she said, adding that some defendants who had originally been granted bail were later put back behind bars.According to exiled activist Sunny Cheung, the defendants ""still try to write some public letters through social media, and encourage the Hong Kong public to be resilient.""So far, 31 of the 47 defendants have already pleaded guilty while 16 others plan not to plead guilty, a position that could lead to longer prison sentences. Four defendants, who are accused as ""principal offenders,"" could face life imprisonment.""I think it's very likely that the defendants, in this case, will receive very harsh and long sentences, as we can see in Jimmy Lai's fraud case in which he was sentenced to more than five years in jail,"" Kwong told DW.Authorities have also removed jurors from the case, citing safety concerns for them and their family members.Eric Lai, a visiting researcher at King's College London, said the decision raises concerns over the fairness of the trial.""The move of not designating juries to these cases reflects the government's deep concern about the outcome of the trial,"" Lai told DW.""This implies that the judicial system in Hong Kong has become more like a tool for the government to achieve their political aim.""Kwong from IPAC remains hopeful. She said she expects the defendants ""will have very powerful messages telling Hong Kongers and the world that this is happening in Hong Kong, and these people are not going to kowtow to the government.""""I hope foreign governments will send representatives to the court to put some pressure on the Hong Kong government, letting them know that the world is still monitoring the situation in Hong Kong,"" she said.Edited by: Sou-Jie van Brunnersum",2023/2/6,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802157,Manchester City charged by Premier League with breaking financial rules,"Reigning Premier League titleholders Manchester City have been referred to an independent commission over alleged breaches of Premier League financial regulations, England's top-flight football league announced on Monday.The period in question covers the first nine full seasons under the club's Abu Dhabi ownership, during which City won the Premier League title on three occasions in 2012, 2014 and 2018 - the year the investigation began after German news magazine Der Spiegel published documents from the Football Leaks cache.The defending champions are alleged to have breached league rules requiring provision ""in utmost good faith"" of ""accurate financial information that gives a true and fair view of the club's financial position […] in particular with respect to its revenue (including sponsorship revenue), its related parties and its operating costs"".City are also alleged to have not fully disclosed player and managerial remuneration over the course of several seasons, plus failure to cooperate and hand over documents as required over five seasons from 2018-19 to 2022-23.According to Premier League rules, City, if found guilty, could potentially face fines, points deductions or even expulsion from the league.In a statement issued later on Monday, Manchester City said it was ""surprised by the issuing of these alleged breaches of the Premier League Rules, particularly given the extensive engagement and vast amount of detailed materials that the [league] has been provided with.""It continued: ""The club welcomes the review of this matter by an independent commission, to impartially consider the comprehensive body of irrefutable evidence that exists in support of its position. As such, we look forward to this matter being put to rest once and for all.""In 2020, the Court of Arbitation for Sport (CAS) overturned a decision by European football's governing body UEFA to ban City from European competition for two years, ruling that ""most of the alleged breaches were either not established or time-barred.""However, no such statue of limitations exists in the separate Premier League investigation. Premier League rules also prohibit appeals of any sanctions to CAS.Furthermore, City are also being charged with failing to comply with Premier League's rules requiring clubs to follow UEFA's financial fair play regulations from the 2013-14 to 2017-18 seasons and failing to follow the Premier League's rules on profit and sustainability from the 2015-16 to 2017-18 seasons.""The members of the Commission will be appointed by the independent Chair of the Premier League Judicial Panel,"" the Premier League said in a statement. ""The proceedings before the Commission will be confidential and heard in private. The Premier League will be making no further comment in respect of this matter until further notice.""jt/mf (AFP, AP, Reuters)",2023/2/6,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802158,Former South Africa midfielder John Moeti dies aged 55,"CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — John Moeti, the former South Africa midfielder who was part of the squad that won the 1996 African Cup of Nations, died at his home on Monday. He was 55.

            The South African Football Association announced Moeti's death but didn't give a cause.

            In a SAFA statement, family spokesman Victor Rakhale said Moeti had fallen ill eight months ago and was receiving specialist medical care. 











            Moeti played 29 times for South Africa between 1995 and 1999 and was part of South Africa's biggest soccer moment when the team won the African Cup on home soil just two years after the end of apartheid.

            He was also captain of Orlando Pirates, one of the country's biggest clubs, and a key player when it became the first South African club to win the African Champions League in 1995.

            Pirates paid tribute to Moeti, saying he “defied the odds” to become a top midfielder despite being just 5-foot-7 tall.

            “Despite his small stature, John was a powerhouse on the field, exhibiting unmatched energy and tenacity,” Pirates said. ""He was known for his ability to dominate the midfield, breaking up opposition attacks and launching his own with ease. 

            “John was a competitor, never backing down from a challenge and always giving his all for the team.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802161,$747M Powerball jackpot up to 9th-largest as drawing nears,"DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — A $747 million Powerball jackpot will be up for grabs Monday night for players willing to risk $2 against the long, long odds of winning the big prize.

            No one has won the jackpot since Nov. 19, 2022, allowing the prize to grow larger with each of the game's three weekly drawings. It now stands as the ninth-largest in U.S. history.

            The game's abysmal odds of 1 in 292.2 million are designed to build big prizes that draw more players. That strategy certainly has worked recently, as someone won a $1.35 billion Mega Millions prize in January and a California player hit a record $2.04 billion Powerball jackpot last November. No one has claimed either of those prizes.











            The $747 million jackpot is for winners who opt for an annuity, paid over 29 years. Higher interest rates have allowed those annuity payments to increased compared with earlier jackpots, when rates were lower.

            Most winners prefer cash, which for Monday night's drawing would be $403.1 million.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802167,New this week: 'Your Place or Mine' and 'All That Breathes',"Here’s a collection curated by The Associated Press’ entertainment journalists of what’s arriving on TV, streaming services and music and video game platforms this week.

            MOVIES

            — Shaunak Sen’s “All That Breathes,” one of the more transfixing and beautiful documentaries of the past year, is about a pair of brothers in New Dehli who make a makeshift clinic to mend and heal the birds of prey who are increasingly falling to Earth in the pollution-choked Indian capital. The film, nominated for best documentary at the Academy Awards, is a stirring and poetic portrait of ecological urban rescue that begins streaming on HBO Max on Tuesday. (It also premieres on HBO on Tuesday.) Nadeem Shehzad and Mohammad Saud may be amateurs, but they've saved some 20,000 birds.











            — With Valentine's Day fast approaching, the rom-coms cometh. Two notable ones are on tap this week: “Your Place or Mine” on Netflix and “Somebody I Used to Know” on Prime Video. Aline Brosh McKenna's “Your Place or Mine,” debuting Friday, stars Reese Witherspoon and Ashton Kutcher as longtime friends who swap houses for a week. Dave Franco's “Somebody I Used to Know” is his second film as director and fourth collaboration with his wife, Alison Brie. Brie stars as a young woman who while visiting her hometown reunites with an old flame (Jay Ellis).

            — Just half a year after the death of NBA great Bill Russell, a new Netflix documentary reflects on the life and legacy of one of the best basketball players of all time. Sam Pollard, the veteran documentarian of “MLK/FBI,"" directs “Bill Russell: Legend” (streaming Wednesday), a two-part film featuring interviews with Russell taped before his death, as well as Steph Curry, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird and Chris Paul. The film illuminates both Russell's on-court accomplishments, including 11 championship titles with the Boston Celtics, and his off-the-court activism.

            MUSIC

            — Paramore‘s “This Is Why” will arrive on Friday and marks the first album from Hayley Williams, Taylor York and Zac Farro since 2017’s “After Laughter.” The trio says the album summarizes “the rollercoaster of being alive in 2022” and the singles seem to hint at a funkier, indie rock approach, including the terrific, jangly title cut. The band’s third single, “C’est Comme Ça,” (which translates roughly into the expression “That’s just how it is”) contains the spicy lyrics: “I hate to admit getting better is boring/But the high cost of chaos/Who can afford it?”

            — Kelela’s second full-length album, “Raven,” arrives Friday with the new seductive single, “Contact.” A mix of ’90s house, electronic and R&B, “Contact” is a super sexy chill way to get ready for a right out and later the feel of sweaty, super cool bodies swaying. One music writer calls her music “the soundtrack to a night drive home as you watch the rain patter on your window, reflecting on how it could have all been different.” The songwriter describes her new album as a “15 track deep-dive into facets of dance music that have always excited me.”

            — Entertainment Writer Mark Kennedy

            TELEVISION 

            — A new Lifetime movie called “Black Girl Missing” is inspired by true instances of missing women of color who don’t get the same attention or spotlight from the authorities and media that a missing white woman does. Garcelle Beauvais executive produces and stars as a woman whose missing daughter is dismissed as a runaway, as news of a missing white girl stirs up a media frenzy. “Black Girl Missing” debuted Saturday.

            — MGM+ (formerly known as EPIX) is out with a new documentary about Jack Roland Murphy — also known as “Murf the Surf.” Murf was an infamous thief, who was also known for his elaborate, tall tales, stole the Star of India sapphire — plus other jewels — from New York’s Museum of Natural History in 1964. To date, it’s the largest jewel thief in the city’s history. Murf went on to be convicted of murder and then sentenced to life in prison, plus additional time added later for other crimes but was paroled in 1986. The four-part series, which premiered Sunday, looks at Murphy’s life, crimes and how a criminal was able to captivate both the media and public.

            VIDEO GAMES

            — The Harry Potter universe is going through rough times, with a series of poorly received “Fantastic Beasts” films and an ongoing controversy over creator J.K. Rowling’s comments against transgender people. Warner Bros. Games is hoping to turn around its fortunes with Hogwarts Legacy, an ambitious open-world adventure set at the school of magic in the 1800s. Players can create their own protagonist, a witch or wizard who “holds the key to an ancient secret that threatens to tear the wizarding world apart” — as if the Potterverse doesn’t have enough agita already. You can pick up your wand Friday on the PlayStation 5, Xbox X/S or PC.

The band’s third single, “C’est Comme Ça,” (which translates roughly into the expression “That’s just how it is”) contains the spicy lyrics: “I hate to admit getting better is boring/But the high cost of chaos/Who can afford it?”— Kelela’s second full-length album, “Raven,” arrives Friday with the new seductive single, “Contact.” A mix of ’90s house, electronic and R&B, “Contact” is a super sexy chill way to get ready for a right out and later the feel of sweaty, super cool bodies swaying. One music writer calls her music “the soundtrack to a night drive home as you watch the rain patter on your window, reflecting on how it could have all been different.” The songwriter describes her new album as a “15 track deep-dive into facets of dance music that have always excited me.”— Entertainment Writer Mark KennedyTELEVISION— A new Lifetime movie called “Black Girl Missing” is inspired by true instances of missing women of color who don’t get the same attention or spotlight from the authorities and media that a missing white woman does. Garcelle Beauvais executive produces and stars as a woman whose missing daughter is dismissed as a runaway, as news of a missing white girl stirs up a media frenzy. “Black Girl Missing” debuted Saturday.— MGM+ (formerly known as EPIX) is out with a new documentary about Jack Roland Murphy — also known as “Murf the Surf.” Murf was an infamous thief, who was also known for his elaborate, tall tales, stole the Star of India sapphire — plus other jewels — from New York’s Museum of Natural History in 1964. To date, it’s the largest jewel thief in the city’s history. Murf went on to be convicted of murder and then sentenced to life in prison, plus additional time added later for other crimes but was paroled in 1986. The four-part series, which premiered Sunday, looks at Murphy’s life, crimes and how a criminal was able to captivate both the media and public.— Alicia RancilioVIDEO GAMES— The Harry Potter universe is going through rough times, with a series of poorly received “Fantastic Beasts” films and an ongoing controversy over creator J.K. Rowling’s comments against transgender people. Warner Bros. Games is hoping to turn around its fortunes with Hogwarts Legacy, an ambitious open-world adventure set at the school of magic in the 1800s. Players can create their own protagonist, a witch or wizard who “holds the key to an ancient secret that threatens to tear the wizarding world apart” — as if the Potterverse doesn’t have enough agita already. You can pick up your wand Friday on the PlayStation 5, Xbox X/S or PC.— Lou Kesten___Catch up on AP’s entertainment coverage here: https://apnews.com/apf-entertainment.",2023/2/6,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802171,Super Bowl draws epic air show of private planes to Phoenix,"PHOENIX (AP) — Former NFL player Jim Bob Morris is heading to the Super Bowl in Phoenix from Bloomington, Illinois, in a newly refurbished set of wheels. His ride has new paint, new seating and even a new bathroom.

            Morris, who played for the Green Bay Packers, Houston Oilers and was even with the Kansas City Chiefs briefly, is CEO of several companies including Morris Packaging and El Bandido Yankee tequila. He and seven other executives will arrive at Scottsdale Airport on Tuesday on the company's Cessna Citation Excel. The midsize jet has chairs that recline far enough for comfortable sleep. There are tables and internet so that everyone can pull out laptops and cellphones to work. Morris plans to fill in as the flight attendant and serve everyone.

            “I know where everything’s at,"" Morris said, chuckling. ""I know where the vodka is at. I know where the El Bandido is at. We actually do serve other spirits other than just El Bandido — if anybody has the courage to order it.”











            Private jet-setters are the reason every Super Bowl comes with super-size air traffic. Officials expect over 1,000 additional planes to descend on metropolitan Phoenix's eight airports and beyond this week for the matchup between the Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles as well as the Phoenix Open, which wraps up on the same day. Many of them will be carrying entertainers, sports figures and corporate VIPs who don’t have to deal with long security lines or cramped coach seats. Instead they’ll be sitting back eating filet mignon and imbibing. Even with the expected long line of airplane departures after the game and high airport fees, some say nothing beats the convenience.

            More than 4,000 additional takeoffs and landings and nearly 1,100 additional aircraft parked at Phoenix-area airports are expected during Super Bowl week, according to the FAA. Over 1,000 additional takeoffs and landings are anticipated at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport during the weekend, said Heather Shelbrack, an airport spokeswoman. Compare that to February 2022 when there were nearly 2,000 aviation operations total for the month.

            Scottsdale Airport, which is closest to the course where the Phoenix Open is played, is expecting a huge turnout, airport spokeswoman Sarah Ferrara said. She had no estimate on how many more planes would be present this week. But in 2015 — when Phoenix last hosted the Super Bowl — there were 1,189 operations during the weekend.

            All reservations for arrival and departure times are handled through fixed-base operators at the airports. It's imperative travelers don’t miss reserved time slot since so many flights are scheduled out. And on a high-traffic periods like right after the game, the takeoff fees for private planes can be sky-high. That’s why Morris plans to leave early next week rather than be caught in the “air show” of nonstop departures Sunday and Monday.

            Morris played in the NFL in the ’80s and actually started out as a free agent with the Chiefs but was released due to injury. But he's not coming just to cheer them on. He also is attending two dozen events for El Bandido for Super Bowl and the Phoenix Open. The company’s ambassadors include former Chiefs players Bill Maas and Dino Hackett. Nick Lowery, former Chiefs placekicker. is a minority owner.

            Flying privately is the way Morris typically does business. In the past year alone, he has logged over 400 hours of travel on one of his company's three planes. 

            “People think it’s sexy and there’s certain elements of it that can be,” Morris said. “So, my deal is about compressing time.""

            For some travelers, the luxury and perks are the appeal. Ion Jets, a brokerage firm that acts as an agent for members looking for private flights, has received over 175 inquiries for Super Bowl weekend. They don't stop at just booking the flight, said CEO Todd Spitzer. 

            For example, a longtime client and current NFL player will be flying on a Gulfstream Jet with seven family members. Since his birthday is around that time, his favorite foods — filet mignon and lobster tails — will be served. They've even booked the family a house in the posh Phoenix suburb of Paradise Valley with a private chef.

            Ion does not own or operate any aircraft. They work with a network of 5,000 aircraft globally, Spitzer said.

            “If somebody owns an aircraft and its ability to be chartered, we keep it busy and we help people who own aircraft offset the cost of their ownership,” Spitzer said. “It’s not just the flight. From ground transportation, hotels, catering, we’re setting up people right now for Shaq’s Fun House ... it’s ground-to-air concierge.”

            Since the pandemic, Spitzer has noticed more interest in private aviation. It might have been out of fear of COVID-19 in the beginning. But now, they are driven by other issues like the wave of cancellations that hit Southwest Airlines in December. 

            “We’ve seen just a huge change in the reason why people are flying privately. It used to be mostly for ease and convenience,” Spitzer said. “And it still is, but it’s actually turned into more of a necessity now.""

            Private jets have come under more scrutiny in recent months by climate change advocates after a highly publicized unofficial study of celebrity travel. One reason it's so concerning is that an airplane can produce higher amounts of greenhouse gas emissions, which linger in the air for literally hundreds of years, according to Sonja Klinsky, an associate professor at Arizona State University's School of Sustainability. On a private aircraft where there are fewer people, the emissions per person will be higher. 

            So, a rising demand for private aviation is “exactly the wrong trend if we’re worried about climate change.""

            “If we have limited atmospheric space, what kinds of activities are we as a society willing to use our limited emissions for? That is a complicated and very important question,” Klinsky said.PHOENIX (AP) — Former NFL player Jim Bob Morris is heading to the Super Bowl in Phoenix from Bloomington, Illinois, in a newly refurbished set of wheels.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802176,Jesse Marsch fired by Leeds after nearly a year in charge,"Jesse Marsch didn't get the chance to save Leeds from relegation again.

            The American coach was fired on Monday after nearly a year in charge of the English team, which looks set to be battling against relegation for the second straight season in the Premier League.

            Leeds hasn't won any of its last seven games in the league and has dropped into 17th place in the 20-team division. The team is only out of the relegation zone on goal difference.











            Marsch's last game was on Sunday, a 1-0 loss at Nottingham Forest, after which he said he understood the frustrations of fans calling for his dismissal and underlined there was a belief inside the club that results would improve.

            The 49-year-old Marsch was hired in February last year as a replacement for Marcelo Bielsa, who was manager for 3 1/2 years and got Leeds promoted to the Premier League after an absence of 16 years.

            Under Marsch, Leeds preserved its Premier League status on the final day of last season but has struggled again during this campaign and is without a win since Nov. 5 — before the World Cup.

            Marsch has regularly bemoaned his team's inability to finish off chances while dominating games. The same thing happened against Forest at the weekend and in its previous two games, a 2-1 loss at Aston Villa and a 0-0 draw at home to Brentford. 

            “We would like to thank Jesse and his backroom staff for their efforts and wish them well for the future,” Leeds said in a short statement, adding that the process of hiring a new manager was underway.

            Leeds' next game is on Wednesday at Manchester United in the league. The teams also meet at Leeds' Elland Road on Sunday.

            Marsch could become a candidate for the vacant U.S. job. The position won’t be filled until after the U.S. Soccer Federation hires a new sporting director, which could take much of the spring and summer.

            Marsch had 37 games as Leeds manager and won 11 of them.

            Among the club's four signings in the January transfer window was Weston McKennie, a midfielder whose arrival took the contingent of U.S. players to three after Brenden Aaronson and Tyler Adams.

            Marsch also brought in another American, Chris Armas, as his assistant last month.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802177,New Indian Ocean fishing rules in big win for coastal states,"MOMBASA, Kenya (AP) — Indian Ocean states agreed Monday to temporarily halt the use of industrial fishing gear that is drastically depleting tuna stocks in a win for countries that rely on smaller-scale fishing methods to prop up the livelihoods of communities across coastal regions.

            The decision comes after three days of turbulent negotiations at the meeting of the 30-member Indian Ocean Tuna Commission in Mombasa, Kenya, where developing nations were at odds with the European Union, whose member states rely more heavily on purse seiners and long liners which are more destructive to the marine environment. 

            The new resolution ""may finally give room to yellowfin and bigeye populations to rebuild,” said Frédéric Le Manach, the Scientific Director of the French ocean conservation group Bloom. 











            The new rules on tuna fisheries were nearly thwarted over the weekend when Kenya’s fisheries minister pulled support for the proposal, with some observers saying the change of heart may have been down to EU pressure. But 11 other states, led by the Indonesian delegation, pushed the resolution through.

            “The persistence shown by all the proponents proves that unity can bring movement to a better direction for the conservation and management of tuna fisheries in the Indian Ocean,” Putuh Suadela, the head of the Indonesian delegation, told The Associated Press.

            Maldivian fisheries expert Hussain Sinan said the new rules introduced by coastal states are “monumental” and will redefine local marine management in the region. 

            The EU has previously been accused of “colonial tendencies” in the Indian Ocean and subsidizing their fishing industry through unfair quotas and opaque fisheries. More than 200,000 metric tons of fish are caught annually in the Indian Ocean by its member states. The EU has 120 days to object to the resolution, according to U.N. rules.

            “Coastal nations are still intimidated by the distant waters fishing nations, especially the EU,” said Le Manach, but added, “what happened over the past three days sends a very strong signal: the bullying days of the EU may be over.” 

            The EU is yet to issue a statement and the AP has asked for comment.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802184,What to Watch: New political vibes this State of the Union,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Look for new faces and fresh political dynamics as President Joe Biden delivers this year's State of the Union address, coupled with attention to some old problems brought back into painful focus by recent events.

            
                The president on Tuesday night will stand before a joint session of Congress for the first time since voters in the midterm elections handed control of the House to Republicans. Biden, like presidents past, will make the case that the nation is strong and that better days lie ahead. But he finds himself in choppy waters as he passes the halfway mark of his term.

            After a series of legislative victories during the first two years of Biden's term, Republicans are looking to undo some of his early wins. Recent mass shootings and a police killing in Memphis, Tennessee, have brought renewed focus to the issues of gun violence and excessive police force. And on the foreign policy front, Biden faces the formidable task of keeping a Western alliance — and the American electorate — united behind Ukraine in its effort to repel Russia's ongoing invasion. He's also dealing with fallout from the U.S. downing of a suspected Chinese spy balloon that floated across the U.S. last week. On top of all that, a special counsel is investigating how classified information from Biden’s days as vice president and senator ended up at his Delaware home and former office. 











            Some things to watch for on Tuesday night:

            WHERE DO I WATCH OR LISTEN?

            The speech is set for 9 p.m. EST and will be broadcast by the major networks and cable news TV channels. The AP will livestream the speech at APNews.com. The White House plans to stream it on its website, and make it available on its YouTube, Facebook and Twitter pages. Live coverage will also be provided by C-SPAN, C-SPAN Radio and C-SPAN.org. NPR is streaming the speech on its website, npr.org, and on its app, in addition to offering live coverage to its member radio stations.

            BIDEN v. MCCARTHY

            It will be new GOP House Speaker Kevin McCarthy wielding the gavel and seated behind Biden on the dais this time rather than Democrat Nancy Pelosi. Watch the body language between the two — and how Republican legislators treat Biden overall after some sharp GOP outbursts from the audience last year. 

            The Democratic president last week said McCarthy made ”absolutely off the wall” commitments to win the speakership. Biden’s rhetorical jabs might not be so sharp in the formal address, but look for him to more subtly argue that there’s an enormous chasm between how he and Republicans approach the economy, health care and Social Security.

            McCarthy, for his part, told reporters he “won't tear up the speech” as Pelosi dramatically did after President Donald Trump delivered his final State of the Union address in 2020.

            GUN VIOLENCE AND POLICING 

            The parents of Tyre Nichols, who was severely beaten by police officers in Memphis and later died, are expected to be in the audience for Biden's address. So is Brandon Tsay, who disarmed the gunman who shot and killed 11 people last month in Monterey Park, California, along with others who jumped in during recent mass shootings.

            Watch how Biden, in their presence, speaks to the recent rash of mass shootings and the beating death of Nichols, after his past efforts to address gun violence and police excesses have been sharply restricted by resistance in Congress. 

            NEW FACES

            There will be plenty of new faces in the crowd as Biden addresses the nation. The nation has a new Supreme Court justice since last year’s address in Ketanji Brown Jackson, and in recent years justices have tended to attend addresses by the president who nominated them. There are new legislators from both parties, as well. Among those getting outsized attention: Rep. George Santos, the New York Republican who has been in the spotlight for embellishments and lies about his education, work experience and other aspects of his personal and professional life.

            FASHION STATEMENTS

            Clothes, pins and other accessories often do double-duty as a way to channel political statements at the State of the Union address, and some will be on display.

            Democrats in the House and Senate will be wearing pins in the shape of tiny crayons to signal support for child care funding as Biden had proposed at the start of his administration. It's an issue championed by Sen Patty Murray, D-Wash., who organized the “Crayons for Kids” crayon pins.

            The blue-and-yellow pins and ribbons in support of Ukraine that were prominent last year, at the start of the Russian invasion, will be worn again by some as the war enters its second deadly year.

            And a special 1870 button that commemorates the first known police killing of a freed Black American man, Henry Truman, was designed by Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman, D-N.J. She is sharing them with colleagues with a notecard that says “153 years later, nothing has changed.”

            THE CHINESE BALLOON

            Look for Biden to talk about his decision to have the military shoot down a suspected Chinese surveillance balloon on Saturday, but how tough will he be on China?

            His comments on the balloon will be part of a broader section on countering China’s more assertive economic and military actions around the world.

            WHAT NEXT IN UKRAINE?

            Biden has repeatedly said the U.S. is committed to helping Ukraine “as long as it takes” to beat back Russia. The United States has already committed nearly $30 billion in security assistance since the start of the war.

            
                Polls show Americans r emain broadly in favor of providing support to Ukraine as it tries to fend off Russia. Administration officials, however, have made clear to Ukraine that Congress' patience with the cost of war is not endless.

            Look for Biden to spotlight that Ukraine has been able to stay in the fight with a more formidable Russian military because of U.S. and allies' generosity. He'll also try to spell out why Americans must remain committed to a war that has ramifications far beyond Europe.

            CLASSIFIED DOCUMENT PROBE

            Will Biden bring it up? Not likely.

            After criticizing Trump for holding on to classified documents after his presidency, Biden now finds himself in the middle of a special counsel inquiry into classified documents that were found in his home and former office space.

            The White House makes the case it's important to distinguish between Biden voluntarily turning over documents and the behavior of Trump, who refused to hand over hundreds of documents, prompting the FBI to raid his home.

            Biden is likely to steer clear of the controversy in his address, as past presidents have tended to avoid mention of whatever's got them into difficulty.

            THE 2024 QUESTION

            Biden is expected to announce he's running for reelection sometime this spring, but there's growing sentiment among voters that he should stick to one term. Will Biden address the reelection question head on? Probably not. But his speech could well be framed as an argument for an additional four years of a Biden White House. And millions of viewers will be evaluating not just Biden's words but his delivery as they weigh whether that's a good idea. 

            CULTURE WARS

            
                Arkansas' new governor, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, will deliver the Republican response to Biden's address. 

            Sanders has staked out ground in the early days of her term on hot cultural issues in schools by issuing executive orders targeting the teaching of critical race theory in Arkansas schools and expressing support for legislation banning instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through the third grade.

            Don't expect her to hold back on the national stage in making the case that Democrats are out of touch with mainstream American values.

            DEMOCRATS BACKING BIDEN

            Ahead of the address, Democrats are providing a fulsome prebuttal in support of Biden— reminding Americans of his accomplishments so far, and as House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries put it, “there is more work that needs to be done.”

            Jeffries said Biden’s speech will show the “clear contrast” between Democrats who “get stuff done” and the “chaotic” Republicans. 

            The Democrats breeze through the policy achievements of the past two years, passing into law the infrastructure and climate change bills, lowering insulin costs and ensuring COVID relief, among other initiatives.

            “This year you will see us rolling out these things that matter to people,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802185,Spiritual advisers offering final comfort in execution rooms,"ST. LOUIS (AP) — For decades, Missouri executions played out in similar fashion: An inmate was strapped to a gurney in a drab room, alone except for the eyes of witnesses staring through thick, soundproof glass as unidentified executioners administered the lethal chemical from behind a cinderblock wall.

            But in November, convicted killer Kevin Johnson spent his final moments speaking softly with a pastor, praying, being assured of forgiveness. When Amber McLaughlin was executed in the same room weeks later, her pastor stroked her hand, providing comfort even as McLaughlin expressed that something was causing her pain.

            
                A Supreme Court ruling last March requires states to allow spiritual advisers to join condemned inmates in their final moments, where they can speak together and even touch. Nationwide, spiritual advisers have been alongside 15 of the 19 people who have been executed since the ruling.











            “At the end of their lives, they were able to find a peace that they couldn't find elsewhere in their lives, and that was important,” said the Rev. Darryl Gray, who was with Johnson.

            It takes a toll on the spiritual advisers, though.

            “Watching someone be killed when they were fully alive — I just can’t get that out of my bones,” said the Rev. Lauren Bennett, McLaughlin's spiritual adviser.

            States previously had varying laws and rules. Texas in 2021 agreed spiritual advisers could be present — but they couldn't touch the inmate or even speak with them. Convicted killer John Henry Ramirez wanted his pastor's comforting words and touch, and sued. It was Ramirez's case that resulted in the Supreme Court decision.

            As Ramirez faced lethal injection in October, the Rev. Dana Moore placed a hand on the inmate’s chest, and held it there.

            “Look upon John with your grace,” Moore prayed. “Grant him peace. Grant all of us peace.” Ramirez responded: “Amen,"" before dying.

            Some inmates have used their final moments to express remorse and seek forgiveness. Among them was James Coddington in Oklahoma, who was executed in August.

            “I can’t give you his exact words, but they were, ‘God, forgive me for my sin,'"" the Rev. Don Heath said, according to The Oklahoman. ""And I said, ‘In the name of the the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, your sins are forgiven.’”

            Prisons are still adjusting. On Jan. 12, Scott James Eizember, 62, received lethal injection for killing an elderly couple in Oklahoma. At first, the Department of Corrections rejected the presence of the Rev. Jeffrey Hood, citing his history of anti-death penalty activism. The agency eventually relented, and Hood was with Eizember at the end.

            Gray, 68, is pastor at Greater Fairfax Missionary Baptist Church in St. Louis and is a leading racial justice activist. He has been involved in prison ministry for decades. He first met Johnson three months before the execution and said he was impressed by how Johnson took responsibility for his crime. Johnson was 19 when he fatally shot Kirkwood, Missouri, Police Officer William McEntee, a father of three, in 2005.

            Johnson was baptized in those final months and was serious in his Bible study, Gray said. A favorite passage of his was the story in Luke about the thief on the cross next to Jesus. The thief repented and Jesus responded, “Truly, I say to you, today you’ll be with me in paradise.”

            Throughout their meetings, Gray had a constant refrain.

            “They can take your life, but they can’t take your dignity,” he told Johnson. “You’re still a person, you’re still a man. Keep that.’”

            When Gray was escorted to the execution chamber on Nov. 29, 2022, Johnson was already on the gurney.

            “I’m keeping my dignity, Rev,” Johnson said.

            One final time, Johnson expressed remorse. God forgave him, Gray responded, rubbing his shoulder. The pastor said he could feel the lethal dose of pentobarbital pulsing into Johnson's bloodstream. He kept praying as Johnson heaved a couple of final breaths, then fell silent.

            McEntee's family members were at Johnson's execution. His wife, Mary McEntee, said Johnson acted as “judge, juror and executioner” in killing her husband.

            Nearly 1,600 people have been executed in the U.S. since the late 1970s, all but 17 of them men. The execution of McLaughlin, 49, was historic. McLaughlin, who began transitioning about three years ago, was the first openly transgender inmate put to death in the U.S.

            Bennett, 33, is pastor at Metropolitan Community Church of St. Louis, where the congregation is predominantly people from the LGBTQ community. She had no previous experience with people behind bars.

            Like Johnson, McLaughlin was sorry for her crime, Bennett said. McLaughlin raped and fatally stabbed 45-year-old Beverly Guenther in St. Louis County in 2003. Guenther's relatives did not speak after McLaughlin's execution, and messages seeking comment from them were not returned.

            “Amber was haunted by the things she did,” Bennett said. “She wanted to find forgiveness from the victim’s family and God.”

            In the execution room on Jan. 3, Bennett and McLaughlin spoke softly about love, peace and the gift of their newfound friendship. Bennett described a “halo of pink” at sunset that evening. Since pink was McLaughlin’s favorite color, “we thought that was a sign that God was ready to welcome her home into an embrace of peace, and sparkle, and comfort,” Bennett said.

            Suddenly, the conversation took an unexpected turn.

            “Ouch, ouch, ouch. It hurts,” McLaughlin said, according to Bennett. McLaughlin never had time to explain.

            “I held her hand and said, ‘I’m so sorry that you’re in pain,’ and ‘you can still be at peace even though you’re in pain. Remember that we’re here for you and we love you and you’re not alone,’” Bennett said.

            Within moments, McLaughlin was dead. Bennett slumped in a chair and cried, ""bitter because her death was physically painful, not peaceful.”

            Missouri Department of Corrections spokeswoman Karen Pojmann said there was no indication that anything went wrong with the execution. Republican Gov. Mike Parson is “confident in the protocol” and won't order an investigation, his spokeswoman said.

            As for future executions, Gray and Bennett aren't sure they're up to doing it again. Another execution is planned for Tuesday in Missouri, when Raheem Taylor is set to die for the deaths of his girlfriend and her three children in 2004. It wasn't immediately clear if Taylor's imam would be present.

            Bennett cited a “level of pain, and the cost” she's still dealing with weeks after McLaughlin's execution, and Gray nodded in agreement.

            “And yet I believe that everybody should be able to die with dignity,"" Bennett said. “In a system where dignity is taken away in every way, for someone to be there for comfort and peace and to remind that person that they can have dignity is huge.”ST.

Bennett slumped in a chair and cried, ""bitter because her death was physically painful, not peaceful.”Missouri Department of Corrections spokeswoman Karen Pojmann said there was no indication that anything went wrong with the execution. Republican Gov. Mike Parson is “confident in the protocol” and won't order an investigation, his spokeswoman said.As for future executions, Gray and Bennett aren't sure they're up to doing it again. Another execution is planned for Tuesday in Missouri, when Raheem Taylor is set to die for the deaths of his girlfriend and her three children in 2004. It wasn't immediately clear if Taylor's imam would be present.Bennett cited a “level of pain, and the cost” she's still dealing with weeks after McLaughlin's execution, and Gray nodded in agreement.“And yet I believe that everybody should be able to die with dignity,"" Bennett said. “In a system where dignity is taken away in every way, for someone to be there for comfort and peace and to remind that person that they can have dignity is huge.”",2023/2/7,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802188,"Review: 'Looking for Jane' is gripping, historical, relevant","“Looking for Jane” by Heather Marshall (Atria)

            Gripping from the moment it begins, Heather Marshall’s novel “Looking for Jane” is getting a well-deserved re-release to hit the post-Roe v. Wade United States market. 

            The story kicks off with a striking prologue: A letter informing Nancy that she was adopted is misdelivered, then misplaced. Years later, when Angela discovers it in a dusty antique drawer, it sends her down a road of discovery as she digs through generations of women in an effort to reunite the letter with its intended recipient. 











            But, despite the author's clear stand on the side of abortion rights for all women, the novel is well-rounded in its representation of women in various stages of their lives with different reproductive goals. 

            Nancy is horrified after she begrudgingly accompanies a friend to an illegal abortion in 1979, when the two are in their teens. Angela is undergoing another stressful round of in vitro fertilization attempts for a desperately wanted pregnancy in 2017. And in 1960, Evelyn finds herself at one of Canada’s homes for unwed mothers, where she’s given no choice but to give her baby up for adoption. 

            Replete with oddly satisfying descriptions — “a pale, doughy man with a voice like cold oatmeal” — and good-natured cliffhangers, “Looking for Jane” has the momentum of a high-speed chase as Angela races back to uncover the past and Nancy and Evelyn’s timelines converge and then speed toward the future.

            Marshall approaches these incredibly personal and emotionally difficult topics with empathy. Rare moments of fury or spite are tempered with a genuine look at the love and fear behind them, rendering characters sympathetic — people just trying to make the best choices they can under the circumstances. This continual, underlying warmth keeps the chilling subject matter and frigid Canadian weather from dampening the novel as a whole. Instead, comforting pops of color adorn the story: a flourishing summer lawn blooming with roses, the silky skin of a newborn, warm tea with family in the living room. 

            The late-book twist is impossible to see coming, but Marshall provides receipts, rendering it valid, clever and satisfying. 

            “Looking for Jane” also brings historical research to the table, drawing upon real-life accounts of often abusive post-war unwed mothers’ homes and even including a fictionalized version of Holocaust-survivor-turned-abortion-provider Henry Morgentaler. 

            Between the rolling back of abortion and health care rights in the United States after Roe v. Wade was overturned in June, and the ongoing national reckoning that countries including Canada and Ireland are facing for atrocities committed in church-run homes, “Looking for Jane” is as relevant today as when it was originally released a year ago, and has the potential to remain pertinent for generations.“Looking for Jane” by Heather Marshall (Atria)Gripping from the moment it begins, Heather Marshall’s novel “Looking for Jane” is getting a well-deserved re-release to hit the post-Roe v.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802189,Russia sentences popular cookbook author over Ukraine posts,"MOSCOW (AP) — A Moscow court on Monday sentenced a popular cookbook author and blogger to nine years in prison after convicting her in absentia of spreading false information about the country’s military. The trial was part of the Kremlin’s sweeping, months-long crackdown on dissent. 

            The charges against Veronika Belotserkovskaya, who lives abroad, were brought over her Instagram posts that the authorities alleged contained ""deliberately false information about the use of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation to destroy cities and the civilian population of Ukraine, including children.”

            Belotserkovskaya, whose Instagram profile says she was born in Odesa, a city in southern Ukraine, responded to the news of the sentencing by writing that she is, “on one hand, perplexed, and on the other hand, of course, proud.”











            Russia’s Investigative Committee announced launching a case against Belotserkovskaya on March 16 2022, several weeks after Moscow's troops rolled into Ukraine. It was the first publicly-known case under a new law adopted earlier that month that penalized information seen as disparaging to the Russian military.

            The Russian authorities issued an arrest order for the blogger in absentia, put her on a wanted list and seized 153 million rubles (roughly $2.2 million) worth of her assets. 

            She was also declared a “foreign agent,” a designation that implies additional government scrutiny and carries strong pejorative connotations aimed at discrediting the recepient. 

            Belotserkovskaya by far has been handed the longest prison sentence under the new law and is the second prominent public figure to be sentenced in absentia.

            Last week, a Moscow court sentenced Alexander Nevzorov, a television journalist and former lawmaker, in absentia to eight years in prison on the same charges. Nevzorov was accused of posting “false information” on social media about the Russian shelling of a maternity hospital in the Sea of Azov port of Mariupol. Moscow has fiercely denied its involvement.

            The journalist moved abroad after the start of the Ukrainian conflict.

            In December, prominent opposition politician Ilya Yashin was sentenced to 8½ years in prison under the same law. Earlier last year, Alexei Gorinov, a member of a Moscow municipal council Yashin used to chair, was sentenced to seven years in prison for his critical remarks about the hostilities in Ukraine. 

            Another leading opposition figure, Vladimir Kara-Murza, is currently in custody facing the same charges.MOSCOW (AP) — A Moscow court on Monday sentenced a popular cookbook author and blogger to nine years in prison after convicting her in absentia of spreading false information about the country’s military.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802200,"What LeBron passing Kareem means to NBA, greatest debate","It has happened. LeBron James finally has passed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for the NBA's career scoring record, the torch getting passed from one member of the Los Angeles Lakers to another.

            
                The record-breaker came Tuesday, when James scored 38 points to push his career total to 38,390 — three more than Abdul-Jabbar.

            Here’s the significance of James passing Abdul-Jabbar:











            WILL THIS RECORD BE BROKEN AGAIN?

            Perhaps, but no time soon.

            James is on pace to eclipse the 40,000-point mark next season and is under contract for one more season after that as well. And even then there's no guarantee that he won't continue playing; he has said many times he would like to stay in the NBA long enough for his son, LeBron James Jr. — he goes by “Bronny” — to get to the league, something that won't happen until 2024-25 at the earliest.

            The closest player currently in the NBA to James on the all-time list is Brooklyn’s Kevin Durant, who has 26,684 points. Durant would probably have to play at least another six or seven seasons just to catch Abdul-Jabbar’s mark — and who knows how far James will raise the bar by then.

            Philadelphia’s James Harden and the Lakers’ Russell Westbrook are just over 24,000 points apiece. Both of them are all-time greats, but they’re not going to catch James.

            Dallas’ Luka Doncic is averaging 27.4 points per game so far in his career. But for as great as Doncic is, he’ll need to average that many points for another 14 seasons or so before he gets to the 38,000-point mark.

            So unless the NBA adds a 10-point shot, the record won't be broken for a very, very, very long time.

            HOW DID JAMES GET TO THIS POINT?

            James entered the NBA straight out of high school; Abdul-Jabbar had a college career before he was eligible to join the league. James was 18 when he scored his first NBA points; Abdul-Jabbar was 22.

            It took Abdul-Jabbar 20 seasons to get to 38,387. James caught him in his 20th season.

            James has been durable, especially over the first three-quarters of his career. He missed only 71 games in his first 15 seasons. Since joining the Lakers 4-1/2 seasons ago, he has missed nearly 100 games. But he has always avoided major injury; part of that is just good luck, but much of it is because he reportedly invests more than $1 million annually on his body.

            For almost the entirety of James' career, keeping The King fit has fallen on the shoulders of Mike Mancias, one of the most-trusted members of James' inner circle. Mancias never wants any credit for his work; he shuns limelight the way James blows past defenders. But in 2019, when James was revealed as The Associated Press' male athlete of the decade for the 2010's, Mancias shed a tiny bit of light on James' work ethic.

            “He does whatever it takes when it comes to fulfilling his commitments to everything,"" Mancias said, ""especially his game and his craft.”

            DIDN'T JAMES BREAK THE RECORD LAST YEAR?

            Official NBA records are based solely on regular season games. Playoff games are in their own category. That's why the record, for almost 39 years now, was Abdul-Jabbar with 38,387 points. But when adding postseason games to that total, Abdul-Jabbar actually retired with 44,149 points.

            And that's the figure James — again, when adding in his playoff points — eclipsed on Feb. 12, 2022, in a Lakers loss against the Golden State Warriors. So while that is “a"" record, it's not “the"" record.

            DOES THIS SETTLE THE ‘GOAT' DEBATE?

            For those unfamiliar with the acronym, ‘GOAT' is shorthand for Greatest Of All Time.

            James may very well be the GOAT, based on his longevity, his accomplishments, how no one in NBA history has been so hard to stop for 20 years and counting. Abdul-Jabbar should be in the conversation as well; his sky hook — a one-handed shot released high over his head, impossible for any defender to stop without the use of a stepladder — is one of the most dominant weapons basketball has ever seen.

            Michael Jordan won six NBA championships with the Chicago Bulls on his way to becoming a global icon and might have been the greatest competitor in the sport's history. Golden State's Stephen Curry is the most prolific 3-point shooter the game has ever seen and still going strong. The Lakers' Magic Johnson and Boston's Larry Bird had a rivalry that brought them both multiple championships and might have saved the NBA in the 1980's. San Antonio's Tim Duncan spent nearly two decades in the league and was maybe the most fundamentally solid player ever.

            Wilt Chamberlain scored 100 points in a game and once averaged 50 for an entire season. Kobe Bryant had an 81-point game, finished with five championships and spent years being simply unstoppable. And Bill Russell won 11 championships with the Boston Celtics.

            This record doesn't even settle the debate on greatest scorer ever. James is passing Abdul-Jabbar for the most points — but Jordan still averaged the most, his 30.12 per game pace over the entirety of his career ranking just ahead of Chamberlain's 30.07. James averages around 27 per game; Abdul-Jabbar averaged around 25.

            The answer to the GOAT debate is there isn't one. There are many. Personal preference prevails.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802205,What to know about the big quake that hit Turkey and Syria,"NEW YORK (AP) — A major 7.8 magnitude earthquake followed by another strong quake devastated wide swaths of Turkey and Syria early Monday, killing thousands of people.

            Here's what to know: 

            WHAT HAPPENED?











            The quake hit at depth of 11 miles (18 kilometers) and was centered in southern Turkey, near the northern border of Syria, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. 

            Many aftershocks rocked the two countries since the initial quake. In the first 11 hours, the region had felt 13 significant aftershocks with a magnitude of at least 5, said Alex Hatem, a USGS research geologist. 

            Another strong quake — magnitude 7.5 — hit Turkey nine hours after the main jolt. Though scientists were studying whether that was an aftershock, they agreed that the two quakes are related.

            “More aftershocks are certainly expected, given the size of the main shock,” Hatem said. “We expect aftershocks to continue in the coming days, weeks and months.”

            WHAT TYPE OF EARTHQUAKE WAS THIS?

            Researchers said the earthquake was a strike-slip quake, where two tectonic plates slide past each other horizontally. 

            The Earth is divided up into different pieces, “kind of like a jigsaw puzzle,” said Eric Sandvol, a seismologist at the University of Missouri. 

            Those pieces meet at fault lines, where the plates usually grind against each other slowly. But once enough tension builds up, they can snap past each other quickly, releasing a large amount of energy.

            In this case, one plate moved west while the other moved east — jerking past each other to create the quake, Hatem said. 

            Over time, aftershocks will start to die down and become less frequent, Sandvol said.

            ARE EARTHQUAKES COMMON IN THIS AREA?

            The quake occurred in a seismically active area known as the East Anatolian fault zone, which has produced damaging earthquakes in the past.

            “Almost all of Turkey is really seismically active,” Sandvol said. “This is not something new to the country.”

            Turkey was struck by another major earthquake in January 2020 — a magnitude 6.7 that caused significant damage in the eastern part of the country. In 1999, a 7.4 magnitude quake struck near Istanbul and killed an estimated 18,000 people.

            WHY WAS THIS EARTHQUAKE SO DEVASTATING?

            The earthquake was powerful — especially for a quake that hit on land. Typically, very strong earthquakes occur underwater, Margarita Segou, a seismologist with the British Geological Survey, said. 

            On top of that, the quake hit near heavily populated areas. The epicenter was near Gaziantep, a major city and provincial capital in Turkey. 

            The affected regions were also home to vulnerable buildings, said Kishor Jaiswal, a USGS structural engineer. 

            While new buildings in cities like Istanbul were designed with modern earthquake standards in mind, this area of southern Turkey has many older high-rise buildings, Jaiswal said. Rapid construction in Syria — plus years of war — may have also left structures vulnerable, researchers said. 

            Officials reported thousands of buildings collapsed in the wake of the earthquake. They included “pancake” collapses, where upper floors of a building fall straight down onto the lower floors — a sign that the buildings couldn't absorb the shaking, Jaiswal said.

            Rescue efforts have been hampered by freezing temperatures and traffic jams from residents trying to leave quake-stricken areas.

            ""This is the awful level of devastation and destruction that we would expect to see” when a strong quake hits a region with buildings that have not been shored up, said Ilan Kelman, an expert in disasters and health at University College London.

""Then we will expect an increased need for trauma care to treat the injured and to support the entire health system in affected areas.""The UN General Assembly observed a minute's silence in tribute to the victims on Monday, and urged countries to send humanitarian aid.""Our teams are on the ground assessing the needs and providing assistance,"" Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said. ""We count on the international community to help the thousands of families hit by this disaster, many of whom were already in dire need of humanitarian aid in areas where access is a challenge.""Germany is home to about 3 million people of Turkish origin.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802210,Philippines: Ending clan wars crucial to sustaining peace in Muslim south,"A peace agreement between the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) and the Philippine government has ended a decades-long armed conflict in Mindanao, but experts warn clan wars remain a threat to sustainable peace and development in the region.Clan wars, or rido, are recurring hostilities between families and kinship groups marked by a series of retaliatory acts of violence to avenge a real or perceived infraction.Members of an entire family can become the target of a retaliation, spurring a cycle of violence that can turn into intergenerational conflict.""The new [Bangsamoro] government promises peace and security in the region. But, rido is one of the major factors that can make or break the peace process,"" Yasmira Moner, a professor of post-conflict governance at Mindanao State University, told DW.""Without the resolution of rido, violence can spill over to other communities until it becomes a large-scale conflict,"" Moner said.The peace deal ushered in the establishment of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) as an administrative region comprising five provinces in southern Philippines.Rido violence can be traced back to pre-colonial power struggles between local tribal leaders. These strongmen wielded significant economic and political power, and enforced this power through their own militia. US colonization took advantage of rido to turn families against each other and weaken the opposition to colonial rule, Moner explained.In May 2020, the Philippine News Agency reported on a clan war that displaced 4,574 civilians. Last year, local news outlets reported that a bloody clash between two families dispersed hundreds.In 2009, political rivalry between two families, the Mangudadatus and the Ampatuans, resulted in the mass killing of 58 people, including members of the local press. The carnage is seen as the worst case of election-related violence in the Philippines.Esmael Mangudadatu, who lost two sisters, his wife, and some relatives in the violence, later started a conflict settlement program through the Maguindanao Task Force on Reconciliation and Unification (MTFRU) during his time as governor.In 2017, the peace council settled about 138 clan conflicts, according to government data.Speaking to DW, Mangudadatu said that he cited his own experience when negotiating clan conflicts. ""I deliberately chose not to retaliate. It was very painful for me, but if I sought revenge, it would only lead to perpetual conflict. I wanted to serve as an example.""In 2019, a court found 30 people, which included members of the Ampatuan dynasty, guilty of 57 counts of murder and sentenced them to life imprisonment.Peace advocates say that those most affected by clan wars are the estimated 1 million young people in BARMM region, who represent about 5% of the Philippine population.""When we speak of war in Mindanao, we always think of the conflict with the army, but if you look at it, clan wars are what damage our communities the most,"" said Nair Amer, 26.""I grew up without freedom, without a permanent address. My life was contained in the bags we carried whenever we fled,"" Amer told DW.""Nothing good will come out of rido. Communities are displaced, schools are closed, futures are put on hold. We all suffer,"" he added.Amer is determined to prevent Muslim youth from growing up in a vicious cycle of violence and accepting it as the norm. Currently, he serves as a staff officer in the Bangsamoro Transition Authority Welfare and Reconciliation Committee, which collects data on ongoing clan wars and also mediates negotiations between clans.Norhaifah Esmail, 21, has seen the impact of rido on young Muslim women like her. Some are told not to attend school because of safety risks.""It is sad to think that because of rido, there are women who are forced to change their direction in life, just for their safety,"" Esmail told DW.The local government through the Ministry of Public Order and Safety (MPOS) is taking an active stance in institutionalizing methods such as conflict mediation workshops in communities to assist warring families come to a truce. Financial and legal assistance is also provided to ensure lasting peace.Maguindanao del Sur provincial administrator Cyrus Torrena told DW he believes the method works in containing rido and preventing it from spilling over into other forms of violence such as violent extremism.""If you are able to resolve the conflict between families, between clans, you will be able to also resolve other conflicts and issues in the province,"" said Torrena.This story was produced under a reporting grant from the Probe Media Foundation, Inc. and The Asia Foundation.Edited by: Sou-Jie van Brunnersum",2023/2/6,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802211,South Korea struggles to serve up national dish 'kimchi',"South Korea has been forced to sharply increase imports of ""kimchi"" — arguably the most important dish on every family's mealtime table — giving rise to concerns about the quality of foreign versions of the fiery fermented staple.Government statistics show that South Korea imported kimchi with a value of $169.4 million (€157.7 million) in 2022, up 20.4% over the previous year, Yonhap News reported.That increase was the sharpest since a rise of nearly 54% in 2010.A powerful combination of fermented cabbage, salt and hot peppers, kimchi is an indispensable part of the Korean diet and the nation consumes more than 2 million tons of it every year.Most often served as a side dish, it can also be incorporated into soups and stews, with studies indicating that more than 90% of South Koreans eat kimchi every day.And while it remains a critical part of the national cuisine, changes in society have inevitably impacted the dish. Traditionally, women would gather to prepare the ingredients and start the natural fermentation process, ensuring that there would be sufficient to feed the family through the bitter cold winter months.Today, that tradition has faded and most people purchase pre-prepared kimchi during their regular visits to the supermarket.Consumers have largely been able to rely on domestic sources for their kimchi needs, although that has been changing. A couple of bad growing seasons have impacted cabbage crops, increasing prices and reducing availability, but the broader rise in prices — everything from vehicle fuel to electricity and the cost of ingredients — has made it harder for producers to remain competitive.Squeezed by rising costs and falling numbers of consumers, restaurants have been quick to switch to imported kimchi.""The price of absolutely everything has been rising for the last year and it's the same for domestic kimchi manufacturers,"" said Lim Eun-jung, an associate professor of international studies at Kongju National University — and someone who can remember making kimchi with her grandmother as a young child.""On top of that, we have had a couple of bad summers that have badly affected the cabbage harvest,"" she told DW. ""There are also the other ingredients that have become more expensive and it's a labor-intensive process, so it is not really a surprise that it is cheaper to produce kimchi abroad and then import it.""Lim says she usually purchases her kimchi from farmers' markets or online stores so she can verify where it comes from, and she does not mind paying a little more if that gives her peace of mind about the quality.""I think a lot of people have a low level of trust for kimchi and other food that is imported, particularly factory-made food from places like China,"" she said.""People worry about sanitation levels and the quality of the ingredients they use, although there is no question that it is much cheaper.""The concern about imports was heightened in 2021 when South Korean media released images of a vast pool of kimchi being stirred by an excavator and a partially naked man wading through the concoction.Koreans also became angry when Chinese state media claimed the dish had originated in China, triggering a sharp exchange of opinions in the two nations' media and online chat rooms.""When China tried to claim that kimchi was Chinese, I was really angry,"" said Eunkoo Lee, joint founder of a Seoul-based NGO that helps North Korean defectors in the South.""Kimchi is our soul food in Korea, our national dish, and there is never a meal in our family when kimchi is not on the table,"" she said. ""I would go as far as to say that if there was no kimchi with the meal, I do not think I would be able to eat.""This obsession with the tangy dish means that many Koreans who travel overseas for a vacation make sure they take a supply to tide over their needs for as long as they are away, said Lee, of Freedom Speakers International.Lee added that ""kimjang,"" the process of preparing kimchi that involves washing and salting the vegetables, adding garlic, red peppers and cured fish before they are left to ferment in clay pots, is also a significant memory from her childhood — and she still relies on her mother's home-made kimchi instead of taking a chance on packaged kimchi from a supermarket.""It's the best and that's why I do not worry about having to eat imported kimchi.""Edited by: Srinivas Mazumdaru",2023/2/6,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802212,Turkey-Syria earthquakes: Rescuers helping with 'bare hands',"Eyewitnesses have told DW that rescuers in Syria were trying to save victims of a devastating earthquake with their ""bare hands"" amid a lack of resources.A 7.8 magnitude quake struck near Gaziantep in southern Turkey near the border with Syria early Monday, followed by a new 7.5 tremor after midday.Over 2,000 people have so far been confirmed killed in the two countries, with the death toll expected to rise amid ongoing rescue operations.Syria's opposition-held Idlib province in the northwest was among the worst hit regions. The province lacks the technical equipment to rescue survivors of the earthquake, local journalist Omar Albam told DW.Albam spoke from Sarmada, a small town some 30 kilometers north of Idlib city and on the border with Turkey. He said the town has been hit hard, nearly leveled to the ground by the quake.""The earth shook twice. The aftershock felt much longer,"" Albam said, describing the first moments after the quake in Idlib. ""People in Idlib streamed out of their homes, they were in panic.""He said the collapsed buildings were already in bad shape due to the country's civil war, ongoing for some 12 years, and particularly due to ""the Russian airstrikes.""""But newer buildings also collapsed, all over Idlib province,"" the journalist said.He said that entire families remained buried under the rubble.The voluntary Civil Defense Forces were unable to pull people from under the rubble, Albam said. Also known as the White Helmets, the group has been known for years for their ability to rescue people from under the rubble as a result of airstrikes bringing down buildings.Albam said the earthquake also struck connection networks, with some areas completely cut off from communication.""There are currently no reliable estimates of how many people have died as a result of the earthquake. There is chaos and it is still unclear at this time.""The White Helmets had said that the earthquake killed at least 380 people in the opposition-held northwest Syria.On Idlib's streets, residents spoke to DW about the horrors they witnessed. One described how he spent hours searching for his friend's family under debris.""We kept on searching for them until 6 in the morning. We found his wife and two of his children dead. And this is what people are going through.""Many called for international support, saying that though immense, the White Helmets' effort was not enough.""I hope that humanitarian organizations can just help us remove the debris. Just equipment and medical help, nothing more,"" one said.Another resident described the moments of the quake, saying: ""Horrifying moments that we experienced at 4 in the morning. We have never witnessed such an earthquake. Many buildings collapsed. My family and I survived and the neighbors did too, but five people died here. The civil defense [White Helmets] is putting in all its effort. This seems to me like it was the Day of Judgement.""Syria's government-controlled Aleppo, which was badly hit by the devastating Monday earthquake, is not equipped to deal with the aftermath, with most helpers working without proper training, an anonymous eyewitness told DW.The female 30-year-old resident of Aleppo, who did not wish to give her name for security reasons, said most of those helping with the rescue operations were ordinary civilians.""Most of them are not trained for this. They help with their bare hands because there is hardly any recovery equipment. This is dangerous, they could be buried under the rubble themselves at any time.""The woman said the city was in urgent need of blood donation, amid a continuous rise in the number of those injured.""I'm in total shock, I feel all the time that the earth keeps shaking underneath me, but it can also just be that it's my body that's shaking.""Though urged to evacuate their homes, the woman said the people of Aleppo have not heeded the calls.""Because they don't know where to go, and they don't have money to stay in hotels further away from here.""The Syrian Health Ministry said 556 people were killed in the government-controlled provinces of Aleppo, Latakia, Hama and Tartus. Some 1,395 more were injured, the ministry said, adding that the toll was ""not final.""Some historical buildings were destroyed as a result of the quake in the provinces of Aleppo, Hama, and Tartus, the Syrian Cultural Ministry said.The most notable damage reported was that which hit the historic Aleppo Citadel, among the world's oldest and largest castles.The ministry said it sustained ""little to medium"" damage, including the collapse of parts of its Ottoman mill, and the destruction of its entrances. The dome of the minaret of the Ayyubid mosque inside the citadel also sustained partial collapse.Technicians were inspecting the UNESCO-listed Aleppo Old City, the ministry said.Elsewhere in Hama, the ministry reported the collapse of some historic buildings, as well as parts of the minaret of Imam Ismail Mosque. Meanwhile in Tartus, parts of the Marqab castle, also known as the Crusaders castle, collapsed due to the quake.rmt/rt (Reuters, AP, DW sources)",2023/2/6,,

            The court dropped the charges against the Croatians — four couples — following applications by their lawyers. They had earlier pleaded not guilty.

            The eight include Zoran Subosic, 52, a guitarist in a well-known band Hladno Pivo, or Cold Beer, and Immovic Subosic, 41, an administrator, according to Croatian media.

            The charges alleged that on December 7, last year, the four couples acted together to traffic the children. The young children were from neighboring Congo and the couples said they adopted the children through a lawyer.

            When the case came up before Ndola Chief Resident Magistrate Dominic Makalicha, lawyers representing the Croatian couples appealed to the court to discharge the four Croatian couples. Under Zambian laws, the court can discharge accused persons if there is no objection from the prosecutors or if there is insufficient evidence to warrant a conviction.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802214,Florida teen pleads guilty to fatally stabbing classmate,"ST. AUGUSTINE, Fla. (AP) — A Florida teenager faces a possible life sentence after he pleaded guilty Monday to fatally stabbing a 13-year-old classmate 114 times and leaving her body in a wooded area near their homes in 2021. 

            The plea came as jury selection was scheduled to begin Monday morning in the first-degree murder trial of Aiden Fucci, who was 14 when Tristyn Bailey was killed, prosecutors said.

            “I just want to say I plead guilty and I'm sorry for the Bailey family and my family,"" Fucci, 16, told the judge in St. Augustine on Monday morning.











            The judge accepted the guilty plea and said Fucci's sentencing would be scheduled at a later date. Although he was charged as an adult, Florida law sets the sentencing for a juvenile convicted of first-degree murder between 40 years and life in prison. An adult convicted of the same crime would face either a life sentence or the death penalty.

            The girl's family reported her missing on Mother’s Day 2021, and her body was found in the woods following a daylong search. Evidence, including video surveillance, led investigators to Fucci. He was originally charged with second-degree murder, but the charge was upgraded because of the severity of the crime.

            R.J. Larizza, the state attorney for Florida’s 7th Judicial Circuit, said during a news conference after Fucci's arrest that Bailey was stabbed 114 times. He said at least 49 of the wounds were to the hands, arms and the head, and were defensive in nature. 

            In a statement sent Monday, St. Johns County Sheriff Robert Hardwick credited the work that investigators put into the case. 

            “This was an all out agency effort,"" the sheriff said in a statement. “The trial preparation process is just as tedious as the investigation itself. The detectives have not stopped working this case since the initial call we received.""

            Hardwick noted that investigators worked with the state attorney's office in seeking a close to the case.ST. AUGUSTINE, Fla. (AP) — A Florida teenager faces a possible life sentence after he pleaded guilty Monday to fatally stabbing a 13-year-old classmate 114 times and leaving her body in a wooded area near their homes in 2021.The plea came as jury selection was scheduled to begin Monday morning in the first-degree murder trial of Aiden Fucci, who was 14 when Tristyn Bailey was killed, prosecutors said.“I just want to say I plead guilty and I'm sorry for the Bailey family and my family,"" Fucci, 16, told the judge in St. Augustine on Monday morning.The judge accepted the guilty plea and said Fucci's sentencing would be scheduled at a later date.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802222,"Woman plotted with neo-Nazi to attack power grid, feds say","BALTIMORE (AP) — A Maryland woman spent months conspiring with a neo-Nazi leader based in Florida to plan an attack on Baltimore’s power grid, hoping to further their racist mission, law enforcement officials said Monday.

            The plan was thwarted when both suspects were arrested last week, adding to a growing list of similar cases as authorities warn the American electrical grid could be a vulnerable target for domestic terrorists. 

            Sarah Beth Clendaniel, 34, was working with Brandon Russell, who founded a small Florida-based neo-Nazi group, to plan a series of “sniper attacks” on Maryland electrical substations, according to a criminal complaint unsealed Monday. The document also included a photo of a woman authorities identified as Clendaniel wearing tactical gear that bore a swastika and holding a rifle. 











            It wasn’t immediately clear Monday whether either suspect had a lawyer to speak on their behalf. There was no evidence the plot was carried out or any record of damage to local substations. 

            U.S. Attorney Erek Barron praised investigators for disrupting hate-fueled violence.

            “When we are united, hate cannot win,” he said at a news conference announcing the charges. 

            Authorities declined to specify how the planned attack was meant to fulfill a racist motive but suggested the defendants wanted to bring attention to their cause. Russell had discussed targeting the grid during cold weather “when most people are using max electricity,” authorities alleged. 

            According to the complaint, Clendaniel was planning to target five substations situated in a ring around Baltimore, a majority-Black city mostly surrounded by heavily white suburban areas. 

            “It would probably permanently completely lay this city to waste if we could do that successfully,” Clendaniel told a confidential informant she met through Russell, according to the complaint. She was most recently living outside the city in surrounding Baltimore County, officials said. 

            Clendaniel told the informant she was experiencing terminal kidney failure. With just a few months to live, she wanted to “accomplish something worthwhile” before her death, according to the complaint. Many of their conversations focused on how she could get a weapon to carry out the attacks. 

            Investigators also found a document in her Google records that they compared to a manifesto. In it, Clendaniel wrote she would give up “everything” to “have a chance for our cause to succeed.” The document included references to Hitler and other terrorists, according to the complaint.

            “Identifying and disrupting terrorist plots, both foreign and domestic, is one of the FBI’s top priorities,” agent Thomas Sobocinski said at Monday’s news conference. “To those extremists looking to disrupt society and cause chaos in our communities, we will not … tolerate this.”

            Russell, who founded an obscure neo-Nazi group called Atomwaffen Division, has a long history of ties to racist extremist ideologies and past plans to disrupt American infrastructure systems, according to the complaint. Atomwaffen Division leaders recently renamed themselves the National Socialist Order. The group’s mission is civilizational collapse, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center.

            Federal authorities said Russell, 27, landed on their radar after a 2017 shooting left two of his roommates dead. Local law enforcement officers found Russell at the scene, dressed in a military uniform and crying over the news. A third roommate, who was later arrested, told investigators he committed the killings to thwart a terrorist attack by Atomwaffen, which included plans to target U.S. infrastructure. He said Russell knew nothing about the killings, having just returned home from his Florida National Guard duties. 

            Russell ultimately pleaded guilty to explosives charges after authorities found bomb-making materials in the garage. He served five years in federal prison and was on supervised release at the time of his recent arrest, officials said. 

            The attorney who represented him in that case didn’t immediately respond to a message Monday.

            Recent attacks and threats to the U.S. power grid have heightened concerns about protecting critical infrastructure.

            In Washington state, two men were arrested last month on charges they vandalized substations in attacks that left thousands without power around Christmastime. One suspect told authorities they hoped the power outage would allow them to break into a business and steal money.

            A gunfire attack in December on substations in central North Carolina also caused power outages affecting tens of thousands of customers. Law enforcement officials have said the shooting was targeted, though no arrests have been made. Lawmakers there have proposed legislation to toughen penalties for intentionally damaging utility equipment. 

            An account linked to Russell recently sent the confidential informant a video about the North Carolina attack, discussing the substations targeted and their geographic areas, according to the complaint. 

            Baltimore Gas and Electric, which controls the local power grid, thanked law enforcement on Monday and said there was no damage to substations, service wasn’t disrupted and there are currently no known threats to facilities.

            “We have a long-standing partnership with law enforcement and state and federal regulators of the grid to secure critical infrastructure,” the company said in a news release. “This work is even more important now as threats have increased in recent years.”

            Maryland Gov. Wes Moore also praised the investigative efforts that succeeded in “preventing a potentially catastrophic attack on several of Maryland’s electrical substations.”

            Russell and Clendaniel corresponded years ago while incarcerated in separate correctional facilities, authorities said. Officials declined to specify the nature of their relationship or how they met, but the complaint says they discussed having children together. Text messages linked to Russell included a statement that “going to prison was worth it because I might not have met you otherwise.”

            Associated Press writers Sarah Brumfield in Silver Spring and Brian Witte in Annapolis contributed to this report.BALTIMORE (AP) — A Maryland woman spent months conspiring with a neo-Nazi leader based in Florida to plan an attack on Baltimore’s power grid, hoping to further their racist mission, law enforcement officials said Monday.The plan was thwarted when both suspects were arrested last week, adding to a growing list of similar cases as authorities warn the American electrical grid could be a vulnerable target for domestic terrorists.Sarah Beth Clendaniel, 34, was working with Brandon Russell, who founded a small Florida-based neo-Nazi group, to plan a series of “sniper attacks” on Maryland electrical substations, according to a criminal complaint unsealed Monday. The document also included a photo of a woman authorities identified as Clendaniel wearing tactical gear that bore a swastika and holding a rifle.It wasn’t immediately clear Monday whether either suspect had a lawyer to speak on their behalf. There was no evidence the plot was carried out or any record of damage to local substations.U.S. Attorney Erek Barron praised investigators for disrupting hate-fueled violence.“When we are united, hate cannot win,” he said at a news conference announcing the charges.Authorities declined to specify how the planned attack was meant to fulfill a racist motive but suggested the defendants wanted to bring attention to their cause. Russell had discussed targeting the grid during cold weather “when most people are using max electricity,” authorities alleged.According to the complaint, Clendaniel was planning to target five substations situated in a ring around Baltimore, a majority-Black city mostly surrounded by heavily white suburban areas.“It would probably permanently completely lay this city to waste if we could do that successfully,” Clendaniel told a confidential informant she met through Russell, according to the complaint. She was most recently living outside the city in surrounding Baltimore County, officials said.Clendaniel told the informant she was experiencing terminal kidney failure. With just a few months to live, she wanted to “accomplish something worthwhile” before her death, according to the complaint. Many of their conversations focused on how she could get a weapon to carry out the attacks.Investigators also found a document in her Google records that they compared to a manifesto. In it, Clendaniel wrote she would give up “everything” to “have a chance for our cause to succeed.” The document included references to Hitler and other terrorists, according to the complaint.“Identifying and disrupting terrorist plots, both foreign and domestic, is one of the FBI’s top priorities,” agent Thomas Sobocinski said at Monday’s news conference. “To those extremists looking to disrupt society and cause chaos in our communities, we will not … tolerate this.”Russell, who founded an obscure neo-Nazi group called Atomwaffen Division, has a long history of ties to racist extremist ideologies and past plans to disrupt American infrastructure systems, according to the complaint. Atomwaffen Division leaders recently renamed themselves the National Socialist Order. The group’s mission is civilizational collapse, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center.Federal authorities said Russell, 27, landed on their radar after a 2017 shooting left two of his roommates dead. Local law enforcement officers found Russell at the scene, dressed in a military uniform and crying over the news. A third roommate, who was later arrested, told investigators he committed the killings to thwart a terrorist attack by Atomwaffen, which included plans to target U.S. infrastructure. He said Russell knew nothing about the killings, having just returned home from his Florida National Guard duties.Russell ultimately pleaded guilty to explosives charges after authorities found bomb-making materials in the garage. He served five years in federal prison and was on supervised release at the time of his recent arrest, officials said.The attorney who represented him in that case didn’t immediately respond to a message Monday.Recent attacks and threats to the U.S. power grid have heightened concerns about protecting critical infrastructure.In Washington state, two men were arrested last month on charges they vandalized substations in attacks that left thousands without power around Christmastime. One suspect told authorities they hoped the power outage would allow them to break into a business and steal money.A gunfire attack in December on substations in central North Carolina also caused power outages affecting tens of thousands of customers. Law enforcement officials have said the shooting was targeted, though no arrests have been made. Lawmakers there have proposed legislation to toughen penalties for intentionally damaging utility equipment.An account linked to Russell recently sent the confidential informant a video about the North Carolina attack, discussing the substations targeted and their geographic areas, according to the complaint.Baltimore Gas and Electric, which controls the local power grid, thanked law enforcement on Monday and said there was no damage to substations, service wasn’t disrupted and there are currently no known threats to facilities.“We have a long-standing partnership with law enforcement and state and federal regulators of the grid to secure critical infrastructure,” the company said in a news release. “This work is even more important now as threats have increased in recent years.”Maryland Gov. Wes Moore also praised the investigative efforts that succeeded in “preventing a potentially catastrophic attack on several of Maryland’s electrical substations.”Russell and Clendaniel corresponded years ago while incarcerated in separate correctional facilities, authorities said. Officials declined to specify the nature of their relationship or how they met, but the complaint says they discussed having children together. Text messages linked to Russell included a statement that “going to prison was worth it because I might not have met you otherwise.”Their relationship dated to at least 2018. Last May, the complaint says, Clendaniel shipped an online order — a 34-piece “Professional Pocket Picking Hand Tool” — to Russell’s Orlando address.Clendaniel has a long criminal history in Maryland, including a 2006 robbery conviction in Cecil County, a largely rural area about an hour northeast of Baltimore.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802223,Mali orders UN human rights official to leave the country,"BAMAKO, Mali (AP) — Mali's government has ordered the U.N. peacekeeping mission's human rights chief to leave the country by Tuesday, declaring him persona non grata in the latest sign of tensions between Mali's leaders and the international community.

            A government statement Sunday criticized Guillaume Ngefa-Atondoko Andali for choosing someone who represented Malian civil society at a U.N. Security Council briefing. The communique accused the human rights director of ""destabilizing and subversive actions.”

            The U.N. peacekeeping mission known as MINUSMA said in a statement Monday that it “deeply regrets this decision.”











            “MINUSMA reaffirms its commitment to continue to work impartially to implement its mandate to promote and protect human rights, which is an important component of Mali’s stabilization efforts,” the statement said.

            Mali's government has taken issue in particular with the choice of Aminata Dicko to appear at the U.N. hearing late last month. Dicko, the vice president of a human rights NGO called Kisal, denounced alleged killings by the Malian army and the shadowy Russian military contractor the Wagner Group.

            Andali's expulsion announced Sunday comes as Mali's government faces growing questions about its human rights record and its relationship with the Wagner mercenaries.

            Last week independent human rights experts working with the U.N. called for an investigation of possible abuses, war crimes, and crimes against humanity committed by Mali's government forces and Wagner mercenaries.

            “We are particularly worried by credible reports that over the course of several days in late March 2022, Malian armed forces accompanied by military personnel believed to belong to the Wagner Group, executed several hundred people, who had been rounded up in Moura, a village in central Mali,” the experts said in a statement.

            Mali has been battling an Islamic insurgency since 2012 and has seen its international partners dwindle since a 2020 military coup. Last year France withdrew its forces after nine years of helping to fight Islamic extremists in its former colony amid rising tensions with the country's military leaders.BAMAKO, Mali (AP) — Mali's government has ordered the U.N. peacekeeping mission's human rights chief to leave the country by Tuesday, declaring him persona non grata in the latest sign of tensions between Mali's leaders and the international community.A government statement Sunday criticized Guillaume Ngefa-Atondoko Andali for choosing someone who represented Malian civil society at a U.N.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802225,Chanderpaul 207 and Brathwaite 182 underpin Windies' 447-6,"BULAWAYO, Zimbabwe (AP) — Tagenarine Chanderpaul hit a double hundred before West Indies declared on 447-6 and reduced Zimbabwe to 114-3 on day three Monday of the first test.

            Chanderpaul was 207 not out when the declaration was made 10 overs before tea. The son of West Indies great Shivnarine Chanderpaul reached his maiden test hundred on a rain-affected second day, alongside fellow opener and captain Kraigg Brathwaite.

            They resumed with the total at 221 without loss, and continued to dominate on the flat pitch by advancing to 336, the highest opening stand by West Indies in a test. They eclipsed the 298 between Gordon Greenidge and Desmond Haynes in 1990 against England at St. John’s.











            Brathwaite was attacking the bowling to give them enough time to bowl out Zimbabwe twice, when he moved forward to sweep Wellington Masakadza and was out lbw for 182 from 312 balls. He hit 18 boundaries and missed out on a second double century.

            Kyle Mayers was bowled for 20 in the only other wicket before lunch, but legspinner Brandon Mavuta also got the next four wickets to earn his maiden five-for in only his third test, and first since 2018.

            “It's about patience and persistence, and today it paid off,” Mavuta said after finishing with 5-140 from 41 overs. ""I’m quite happy to be back in the team, and to be in the position we are. I’m pretty chuffed to contribute.”

            Chanderpaul, who started the day on 101, stood form against Mavuta and reached 200 in style by stepping into Masakadza and smashing him back over his head for his third six.

            Chanderpaul added two more runs in the over and West Indies declared with him on 207 off 465 balls.

            “Congrats to Tage on his maiden century, good to see him convert it to a double,” former captain Jason Holder said. ""Well played to the captain as well. It was a really good partnership. Good to see them not only lay down the foundation but also take it really deep.

            “I don't want to talk about the team plan, we just need wickets. We need to be ruthless.”

            In reply, Innocent Kaia and Tanunurwa Makoni, playing their first test, opened for a combined 63 past tea when Makoni was dismissed by Alzarri Joseph for 33.

            Chamu Chibhabha was caught behind off Gudakesh Motie and the game ended when captain Craig Ervine was bowled by Brathwaite in his first over.

            Kaia was left on 59 not out after 115 balls. They trailed by 333 runs on the first innings.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802228,Missouri governor denies clemency for man facing execution,"ST. LOUIS (AP) — Missouri Gov. Mike Parson said Monday he will not grant clemency and halt the execution of Raheem Taylor, who faces lethal injection for the deaths of his girlfriend and her three children.

            Taylor, 58, is scheduled to be put to death Tuesday evening at the state prison in Bonne Terre.

            “Despite his self-serving claim of innocence, the facts of his guilt in this gruesome quadruple homicide remain,"" Parson, a Republican, said in a statement. ""The State of Missouri will carry out Taylor’s sentences according to the Court’s order and deliver justice for the four innocent lives he stole.”











            Parson's decision came despite a letter from Derrick Johnson, president of the national NAACP, asking Parson to grant a stay of execution. Johnson wrote that “evidence presented at trial does not support Mr. Taylor's conviction.”

            Separately, nearly three dozen civil rights and religious groups asked St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell to reconsider his decision not to ask a judge for a new hearing on Taylor's claim that he was not even in Missouri when the killings occurred.

            The letter said Bell has a “clear opportunity here to free an innocent Black man whose case was riddled with prosecutorial misconduct, police coercion and brutality, and ineffective assistance of counsel.”

            But Bell said in a statement Monday that although his office would not have sought the death penalty, “we believe the jury got the verdict right"" in finding Taylor guilty, and that he wouldn't seek a new hearing.

            Meanwhile, former St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Bob McCulloch, whose office prosecuted the 2004 case, told The Associated Press that Taylor's claims of innocence are “nonsense,"" and that the evidence against him is overwhelming.

            Taylor himself called into the church service Sunday at Greater Fairfax Missionary Baptist Church in St. Louis. He thanked those who support him.

            “Please continue to let God use you, to work through you, as a vessel because time is one of my most valuable commodities and we only have a small amount of that time, and none of it can be replaced,” Taylor told the congregation as the Rev. Darryl Gray held the cellphone to the microphone.

            Taylor, who previously went by the first name Leonard, shared a house in the St. Louis suburb of Jennings with Angela Rowe and her children — 10-year-old daughter Alexus Conley, 6-year-old daughter AcQreya Conley, and 5-year-old son Tyrese Conley. Taylor boarded a flight to California on Nov. 26, 2004.

            On Dec. 3, 2004, police were sent to the home after worried relatives said they hadn’t heard from Rowe. Officers found the bodies of Rowe and her children. All four had been shot.

            Authorities first believed the killings happened only a few days before the bodies were discovered, at the time when Taylor was in California. But at Taylor’s trial, Medical Examiner Phillip Burch said the killings could have happened two or three weeks before the bodies were discovered.

            Kent Gipson, one of Taylor's attorneys, said several people, including relatives of Rowe and a neighbor, saw Rowe alive in the days after Taylor left St. Louis. Meanwhile, Taylor’s daughter in California, Deja Taylor, claimed in a court filing that she and her father spoke by phone with Angela Rowe and one of the children during his visit. The court filing said Deja Taylor’s mother and sister corroborated her story.

            McCulloch said those alibis provided by Taylor's daughter and her relatives were “completely made up.”

            McCulloch said evidence suggested that Rowe and the kids were killed on the night of Nov. 22 or on Nov. 23, 2004, when Taylor was still in St. Louis County. He noted that Rowe typically made around 70 outgoing calls or texts each day. Starting Nov. 23, she made none.

            Meanwhile, DNA from Rowe’s blood was found on Taylor’s glasses when he was arrested, and a relative taking him to the airport saw Taylor toss a gun into the sewer, McCulloch said. Authorities believe Taylor shot Rowe during a violent argument, then killed the children because they were witnesses.

            The execution would be the third in Missouri in three months, following those of Kevin Johnson and Amber McLaughlin.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802229,Vaccine litigation lingers after lifting of military mandate,"NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Federal appeals court judges closely questioned a Biden administration attorney Monday on the consequences military personnel might face for refusing COVID-19 vaccinations, even though Biden's vaccine mandate for military personnel has been rescinded.

            Lawyers for a group of Navy SEALS and other Navy personnel who refuse to be vaccinated for religious reasons told a 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel that federal court injunctions against the mandate are still needed, in part because decisions on deployments and assignments can still be made based on vaccination status. 

            “Is there any assurance on the record, that there will be no deployment decisions based on vaccination?” Judge James Ho, one of three judges hearing the case asked Department of Justice lawyer Casen Ross.











            Ross said such questions were speculative and not at issue in the case before the court. Ho and Judge Kyle Duncan noted that the administration had only reluctantly ended the military mandate after December congressional action, but Ross assured the panel that there are no plans to bring back the requirement. 

            “Given the prevailing public health guidelines and the state of the virus, there is currently no intention to require universal vaccination of all service members,” Ross said.

            The Pentagon formally dropped the requirement in January following a December vote in Congress to end the mandate. However, vaccine opponents note that commanders can still make decisions on how and whether to deploy unvaccinated troops, under a memo signed last month by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. 

            Military leaders have long argued that to maintain unit health and troop readiness, troops have for decades been required to get as many as 17 vaccines, particularly those who are deploying overseas.

            Attorneys for the unvaccinated Navy personnel argued in briefs to the 5th Circuit that Austin’s memo and other Defense Department actions show that the Navy still intends to treat unvaccinated personnel “like second-class citizens because of their religious beliefs.”

            Government lawyers argue the policy is in line with “well-established principles of judicial noninterference with core military decision making,” in their briefs. 

            The Navy SEALS filed their lawsuit in November of 2021, describing what they saw as a cumbersome 50-step process to obtain religious exemptions for the COVID-19 vaccine. Their lawyers have called a “sham” with applications being “categorically denied.” 

            The Defense Department denied the process was onerous and said the Navy has a compelling interest in requiring vaccinations for personnel who often operate for long periods in “confined spaces that are ripe breeding grounds for respiratory illnesses.”

            On Monday, Heather Hacker, an attorney for the Navy personnel, said the situation could be seen as worse now for them now that the older mandate policy has been rescinded, because current policy does not provide for a sailor's religious objections to the vaccine to be considered when deployment or assignment decisions are made. 

            “We're going from a 50-step process to a zero-step process?"" Duncan asked. 

            “Exactly, your honor,” Hacker replied. 

            In January of last year, a federal judge in Texas barred the Navy from taking any action against the Navy plaintiffs for being unvaccinated. A 5th Circuit panel rejected the Biden administration's request to block the judge's order. 

            But the administration won at least a temporary, partial victory last March when the Supreme Court approved a “partial stay.” The order allowed the Navy to consider the sailors’ vaccination status in making decisions on deployment, assignment and other operational issues while the case plays out. 

            There was no indication when the judges would rule. Monday's arguments were heard by Duncan and Ho, both nominated to the 5th Circuit by President Donald Trump, and James Graves, a nominee of President Barack Obama.NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Federal appeals court judges closely questioned a Biden administration attorney Monday on the consequences military personnel might face for refusing COVID-19 vaccinations, even though Biden's vaccine mandate for military personnel has been rescinded.Lawyers for a group of Navy SEALS and other Navy personnel who refuse to be vaccinated for religious reasons told a 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel that federal court injunctions against the mandate are still needed, in part because decisions on deployments and assignments can still be made based on vaccination status.“Is there any assurance on the record, that there will be no deployment decisions based on vaccination?” Judge James Ho, one of three judges hearing the case asked Department of Justice lawyer Casen Ross.Ross said such questions were speculative and not at issue in the case before the court.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802231,Purdue stays No. 1 in AP Top 25; NC State in at No. 22,"Purdue's unquestioned grip on No. 1 in The Associated Press men’s college basketball poll is gone after a weekend loss. That didn't stop the Boilermakers from remaining at the top anyway.

            The Boilermakers earned 38 of 62 first-place votes in the poll released Monday to remain at No. 1 for a third straight week and seventh time this season. Purdue was the unanimous choice last week, the first for any team this season, before falling at Indiana over the weekend for only its second loss.

            The Boilermakers (22-2, 11-2) have a leading candidate for national player of the year in Zach Edey and KenPom's No. 1-ranked offense (121.1 points scored per 100 possessions) to go with a top-25 defense. But they got down big, committed 16 turnovers and allowed the Hoosiers — up to No. 18 this week — to shoot nearly 53% in a 79-74 loss Saturday.











            “When we go to Zach and we make some perimeter shots, the defense gets better sometimes when the offense flows,” Purdue coach Matt Painter said at his postgame news conference. “And you can't do that. You can always rebound, you can always take care of the ball, you can always make your free throws, those things there.”

            The loss meant Houston collected 22 first-place votes as it rose one spot to No. 2, followed by No. 3 Alabama and No. 4 Arizona in each claiming one.

            THE TOP TIER

            Texas jumped five spots to No. 5, shooting past Tennessee, which fell four spots to No. 6 after losing last week at Florida.

            UCLA, Virginia, Kansas and Marquette rounded out the top 10, with Shaka Smart's Golden Eagles cracking the top 10 for the first time since 2019.

            RISING

            The Longhorns' jump marked the biggest of the week, followed by Marquette and Miami each rising four spots. No. 13 Xavier, No. 15 Saint Mary's and No. 21 UConn joined Indiana in each moving up three positions.

            In all, 12 teams rose from last week's rankings.

            SLIDING

            Kansas State took the week's biggest tumble, falling five spots to No. 12 after losing at Kansas and at home to Texas last week. No. 16 Gonzaga joined Tennessee in falling four spots after its overtime loss at Saint Mary's.

            In all, nine teams fell from last week's rankings.

            STATUS QUO

            Purdue was the only team to remain in the same position this week.

            WELCOME

            North Carolina State earned its first AP Top 25 ranking in four years, checking in at No. 22.

            The Wolfpack (19-5, 9-4 Atlantic Coast Conference) spent six weeks in the poll during the 2018-19 season. N.C. State already has surpassed the win total for each of the last two seasons and is in contention for the program's first NCAA Tournament berth since 2018.

            Creighton and Rutgers joined N.C. State as this week's new additions to the poll, though both were ranked earlier this season. The Bluejays were No. 9 in the preseason poll and peaked at No. 7 before falling out by mid-December, while the Scarlet Knights spent a week at No. 23 in mid-January.

            FAREWELL (FOR NOW)

            Florida Atlantic (No. 19), Clemson (No. 20) and Auburn (No. 25) fell out of this week's poll.

            CONFERENCE WATCH

            The Big 12 leads all leagues with six ranked teams, including No. 11 Iowa State, No. 14 Baylor and No. 17 TCU. The Big East is next with five ranked teams, followed by the Big Ten and ACC with three each.

            The Pac-12, Southeastern and West Coast conferences each have two ranked teams, while the American Athletic and Mountain West each have one.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802232,ABC's 'Not Dead Yet' is a comedy with a weekly ghost story,"NEW YORK (AP) — While TV writers Casey Johnson and David Windsor were winding down the emotional roller coaster series “This Is Us,” they had another project waiting to soar — one with ghosts.

            Their new “Not Dead Yet,” about a newspaper obituary writer haunted by the subjects she is writing about, lands on ABC this week, less than a year after viewers bid goodbye to “This Is Us” characters Randall, Kate and Kevin.

            “With the end of that show, it was a lot about death. And here we were at the same time giving birth to this other baby,"" said Windsor. ""It was sort of a nice cycle of life.”











            In “Not Dead Yet,” airing Wednesday, Gina Rodriguez plays Nell, a newly single reporter who returns to her California newspaper 10 years after she quit to follow a love interest to London. Things have changed for everyone.

            She lands on the obituary desk — “Everyone has a story. It’s your job to find it,” she is told — and in the pilot is soon visited by the ghost of her first story. It does not go well.

            “No, uh-uh, I do not see dead people,"" she tells the spirit. ""This has just got to be the chili cheese fries and the cake and the five cocktails and maybe the half gummy I ate.” To which the ghost deadpans: “Go easy there, Keith Richards.”

            The use of a new ghost each week allows Nell to explore other lives and experiences, and they, in turn, help advise a women who admits she's a mess, someone who drinks a little too much and wears bathing suit bottoms when she runs out of clean underwear.

            “There’s two things about the people who’ve passed away,” says Johnson. “What can they bring up in Nell’s life that she can explore and what can she learn from this person’s life that’s specific to them. So it’s just kind of this rich territory.” 

            Some of the ghosts Nell meets include a jingle writer who teaches Nell about one-hit wonders, a hard-charging success coach who reveals not all advice is useful and a social media influencer who brings up hurt memories of high school. It airs while another spirt-filled comedy — CBS' “Ghosts” — has begun its second season.

            “Not Dead Yet” co-stars Hannah Simone from “New Girl” as Nell's best friend, “Superstore” alumna Lauren Ash as her chilly boss, “Cleopatra Jones” star Angela Gibbs as a new friend and “As We See It” star Rick Glassman as her roommate.

            Guest star ghosts over the first series include Martin Mull, Ed Begley Jr., Mo Collins, Deborah S. Craig, Telma Hopkins, Don Lake, Rhea Perlman, Paula Pell, Tony Plana and Julia Sweeney.

            Johnson and Windsor, who created and executive produced “The Real O’Neals,” were coming off a three-year run as co-executive producers of “This Is Us” and based their new series on a book by Alexandra Potter. They managed to get the series filmed before Rodriguez gave birth.

            Both writers had mourned the recent passing of a parent and found themselves missing their loved ones and wishing they still had their guidance.

            “It was almost wish fulfillment thinking like, ‘Wow, what would happen if we could talk to them? What would happen if we could seek them out and and get their advice?’” said Windsor.

            Johnson and Windsor had primarily done comedies before “This Is Us” but they always tried to give their shows a dramatic, emotional heart. “Not Dead Yet” has elements of both.

            “We were wondering if there was a way to kind of meld the two worlds,” said Johnson. “Can we do a comedy that has hard jokes and is a lot of fun, but then also goes for these really emotional, real moments? To us as writers, that was a really exciting experiment and we were really thrilled that ABC was on board.”

            “Not Dead Yet” is also a workplace show, one that makes fun of co-workers who bring large salads to work and the cliques that form, like the adult jocks and the forever nerds.

            Johnson notes that leading a TV show mirrors a lot of office culture and offers plenty to mine: “We’re in a writers' room with bad fluorescent lights and dried up Sharpies and lunches out of plastic containers,” she said, laughing.

            They said that when writing episodes there were times when the notion of the ghost came first and other times the idea for Nell to explore something in her life dictated the arrival of a certain ghost.

            For the episode when Nell confronts a nemesis from high school — guest actor Brittany Snow plays her perfectly as a conceited adult social influencer — the writers started with a past bully.

            “We knew we wanted to tell that story because we thought that was so unique and potentially funny,"" said Johnson. ""We didn’t yet know what story we wanted to tell for Nell. So the ghost came first. And then we found the story that we wanted to do. But I think in other instances, it’s come a different way.”

            The writing duo have many more ghosts on tap. Windsor said the writers room has about 100 cards of potential dead people. “We just can’t wait to tell them all. Hopefully we get the second, third, fourth season to do it.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802234,F1 driver Albon intends to show his steely side for Williams,"Williams driver Alex Albon intends to show the more steely side to his personality in Formula One.

            The affable Albon is one of the most popular drivers but thinks that also comes with some misperception.

            “I feel like (people) see me as a happy-go-lucky person, but I’ve earned a right to be here,” he said on Monday as Williams unveiled its FW45 livery for 2023. “To get to where I am with what I’ve gone through, I’m much stronger than people can imagine. I’m a hard worker, I’m a fighter, and I’m here to stay.”











            He's in his second year with a Williams team which is rebuilding after finishing last in the constructors' championship. After scoring points in only three races, with a best result of ninth at the inaugural Miami Grand Prix, he feels his motivation has never been higher.

            “I want this more than anyone else. That comes with passion, that comes with fire,"" he said. “I believe that’s the real me. I’m strong.""

            Last September, Albon suffered appendicitis the day before the the Italian GP, had immediate surgery and overcame breathing complications. He was meant to be asleep for days but woke up watching his replacement Nyck De Vries on television.

            “My thought when I came out of the coma was ‘Where did my teammates qualify?’ I wanted to be in that car more than anyone else,” Albon said. “I really felt like I let the team down and it felt like I should have been there.”

            Albon was back behind the wheel just three weeks later in Singapore. 

            Work ethic and dedication make Albon an ideal team player, but also cost him in the past when he needed to be more ruthless.

            The London-born Thai lost his seat at Red Bull to Sergio Perez after two podium finishes in 26 races alongside Max Verstappen. 

            Albon then spent a year out before Williams hired him for 2022 and extended his contract to a multi-year deal.

            The hurt of being cut from Red Bull — and from F1 altogether — stung him into action.

            “When you’re six years old, your only ever dream (is) to be a Formula One driver. So when you have that dream go away, there’s a sharp realisation that things feel like they’re falling apart,” he said. “You turn that energy very quickly into hunger and motivation to get back into the sport that you love. So it was great to have a team like Williams believe in me.”

            Former powerhouse Williams is counting on Albon and his American teammate Logan Sargeant to haul the team back up.

            Williams has won 114 F1 races, but the last of its seven drivers' and nine constructors’ titles was in 1997. 

            An overhaul saw Williams hiring former Mercedes strategy director James Vowles as its new team principal. Vowles held key engineering roles and helped Mercedes secure the constructors’ championship from 2014-21.

            “It seems like James really wants this role and he’s really motivated to push this team along,"" Albon said. ""He’s obviously carrying a lot of experience from Mercedes, which for a team like us I feel we’re going to take with both hands.”

            Preseason testing takes place in Bahrain from Feb. 23-25 and the season starts there on March 5.

            Albon is confident the FW45 will surprise people.

            “You’ll see,"" he said. “It looks different, it looks faster.""

            More AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsWilliams driver Alex Albon intends to show the more steely side to his personality in Formula One.The affable Albon is one of the most popular drivers but thinks that also comes with some misperception.“I feel like (people) see me as a happy-go-lucky person, but I’ve earned a right to be here,” he said on Monday as Williams unveiled its FW45 livery for 2023. “To get to where I am with what I’ve gone through, I’m much stronger than people can imagine. I’m a hard worker, I’m a fighter, and I’m here to stay.”He's in his second year with a Williams team which is rebuilding after finishing last in the constructors' championship. After scoring points in only three races, with a best result of ninth at the inaugural Miami Grand Prix, he feels his motivation has never been higher.“I want this more than anyone else. That comes with passion, that comes with fire,"" he said. “I believe that’s the real me. I’m strong.""Last September, Albon suffered appendicitis the day before the the Italian GP, had immediate surgery and overcame breathing complications. He was meant to be asleep for days but woke up watching his replacement Nyck De Vries on television.“My thought when I came out of the coma was ‘Where did my teammates qualify?’ I wanted to be in that car more than anyone else,” Albon said. “I really felt like I let the team down and it felt like I should have been there.”Albon was back behind the wheel just three weeks later in Singapore.Work ethic and dedication make Albon an ideal team player, but also cost him in the past when he needed to be more ruthless.The London-born Thai lost his seat at Red Bull to Sergio Perez after two podium finishes in 26 races alongside Max Verstappen.Albon then spent a year out before Williams hired him for 2022 and extended his contract to a multi-year deal.The hurt of being cut from Red Bull — and from F1 altogether — stung him into action.“When you’re six years old, your only ever dream (is) to be a Formula One driver. So when you have that dream go away, there’s a sharp realisation that things feel like they’re falling apart,” he said. “You turn that energy very quickly into hunger and motivation to get back into the sport that you love.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802235,Police: Man fatally shot by Indiana cops fired several shots,"MITCHELL, Ind. (AP) — A man who was fatally shot Sunday during an exchange of gunfire that left two southern Indiana law enforcement officers wounded had fired several shots before he was killed, police said.

            Indiana State Police said Anthony Richmond, 29, of West Baden Springs, Indiana, was pronounced dead early Sunday in the Lawrence County city of Mitchell, about 75 miles (120 kilometers) southwest of Indianapolis.

            The agency said Richmond fled on foot from officers as they were trying to handcuff him following the discovery of narcotics in his car, which police had stopped for a traffic violation.











            When officers caught up with Richmond, he resisted arrest before he pulled a handgun and fired at the officers “at point blank-range,” state police said Sunday in a news release.

            
                In a later update that identified Richmond and the officers, the agency said preliminary findings indicate Richmond “fired several rounds at the officers while they were physically apprehending him.""

            Lawrence County Sheriff’s Deputy Joshua Rhoades and Mitchell police Officer Christian Anderson, were wounded by that gunfire but at least one of them was able to return fire, fatally wounding Richmond, state police said.

            Rhoades suffered two gunshot wounds and was released Sunday from an Indianapolis hospital, while Anderson remained hospitalized Sunday in stable condition with a single gunshot wound. 

            An update on Anderson was not immediately available Monday morning. But Lawrence County Sheriff Greg Day said in a statement that both officers “will make full recoveries.” He said Sunday's shooting highlights the dangers officers face every day.

            “I am mindful that a family is mourning the loss of a loved one. The lives of many people were affected by a senseless criminal act,"" he added.

            Indiana State Police is investigating the shooting, which was captured on the officers’ body cameras. The agency said its investigators were reviewing that footage.MITCHELL, Ind.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802249,"Coaching carousel spins perfectly for Bruins, Stars, Knights","Getting fired by the Boston Bruins didn't stop former coach Bruce Cassidy from picking up the phone and giving some advice when replacement Jim Montgomery called to ask.

            
                Getting fired by the Vegas Golden Knights also didn't stop Peter DeBoer from answering a call from Cassidy, who replaced him in his old job. DeBoer was off to the Dallas Stars, where Montgomery last had a head coaching job before being dismissed in 2019 for off-ice reasons.

            The weird offseason rotation of musical coaches around the NHL turned out great for everyone involved, with all three teams leading their respective divisions at the midway point of the season. Montgomery's Bruins are running away with the Eastern Conference, DeBoer's Stars and Cassidy's Golden Knights are also on track to make the playoffs and it seems every situation was a perfect fit.











            “Sometimes, a new body comes in, a new voice and things work,” Montgomery said Friday at All-Star Weekend in South Florida, where he was joined by DeBoer and Cassidy. “The credit I give both of those guys is Butch and Pete have done a great job for a long time, and I’d like to be able to copy what they’ve done.”

            It was almost so perfect a fit that Montgomery came close to buying Cassidy's old house. The only thing stopping him was the desire for a quieter street for his 5-year-old daughter.

            Other than that, it has been a seamless transition for Montgomery, likely the front-runner for the Jack Adams Award as coach of the year making the most of his second chance. Fired by the Stars in December 2019 for inappropriate conduct, Montgomery sought help for alcohol abuse, spent two seasons as an assistant with the St. Louis Blues and got the job in Boston with a team Cassidy coached to the playoffs the previous six years.

            The Bruins won 39 of their first 51 games and are on pace to break the record for the best regular season in NHL history. 

            ""To see him where he deserves to get another chance to see him kind of making the most of it, that’s awesome,"" said Anaheim Ducks All-Star forward Troy Terry, who played three seasons under Montgomery at the University of Denver from 2015-18, when the retired center emerged as hockey's next potential coaching phenomenon. 

            “It’s not surprising. From just the brain and just the mind for hockey of people I’ve been around in my career, I’d put him at the top, probably: just his intelligence for the game, the way he sees it, the way he can make adjustments.”

            Credit some of those adjustments to Montgomery's chat with Cassidy, who despite a bitter end to his time in Boston filled in his successor on the staff, players and some of their strengths and weaknesses.

            “I felt like I had a good handle because of the information that he gave me of what I was walking into as the Bruins head coach,” Montgomery said.

            So did Cassidy in Vegas after chatting with DeBoer, who took the fall for an injury-riddled season that included the Golden Knights missing the playoffs for the first time in their five years of existence. 

            “It’s nice when the coaches are willing to kind of share a certain amount of information, even though we compete against each other all the time,” Cassidy said. “Pete and I have been around a little bit longer, so we know the league. Monty obviously with Dallas and St. Louis got to know the league, so I think you do understand what goes into it.”

            Cassidy agreed with Montgomery that there's something to be said for “a new voice” in charge of a team and credited the leadership groups in place for all three teams having success.

            Vegas All-Star center Chandler Stephenson also sees plenty of similarities — although different mannerisms — between Cassidy and DeBoer, who he's pleased to see winning with the Stars.

            ""They both have their systems, have their way of playing and envisioning us to play that way every night,"" Stephenson said. “(DeBoer has been) at it for so long, so he was bound to have success. Not really surprised. He’s a great coach and a great person, too. He was just bound to get Dallas to where they want to be.”

            But DeBoer doesn't want this fortunate turn of the coaching carousel to serve as an advertisement for firing coaches every couple of years. On his fifth NHL stop after stints with Florida, New Jersey and San Jose — including taking the Devils and Sharks to the Stanley Cup Final — the now-grizzled veteran points to the coaching continuity of the past two champions, Colorado and Tampa, as evidence of what wins at this level.

            “The fact that all three of us landed in spots with good teams and made an impact when we got there, I think what it shows you is the depth of coaching at this level and I think the levels below us,” DeBoer said. “There’s a lot of great coaches out there.”

            So many that the coaching tree has more than just three winning branches.

            
                Rick Bowness, who DeBoer replaced in Dallas, took over for Montgomery and coached the Stars to the Cup Final in the 2020 bubble, has the Winnipeg Jets safety in playoff position in the West. Former Jets coach Paul Maurice 's Florida Panthers are also just a few points back of a wild-card spot in the East.

            That's no coincidence given the amount of assistance coaches want to give each other while bouncing around the league.

            ""You help each other out,"" Montgomery said. “The brotherhood we have is special.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802251,Indiana reaches No. 2 in women's AP Top 25; SC still No. 1,"South Carolina beat a top opponent to remain No. 1 in The Associated Press women's college basketball poll released Monday and now has a showdown with another one looming this weekend.

            The Gamecocks (23-0) topped then- No. 5 UConn 81-77 on Sunday to remain unbeaten and stay the unanimous choice atop the poll from the 28-member national media panel. After facing Auburn on Thursday, South Carolina will play No. 3 LSU on Sunday in a matchup of the last two unbeatens in Division I women's college basketball.

            Dawn Staley's team has won 29 consecutive games and has been No. 1 in the poll for 33 consecutive weeks. That's one week short of tying the Huskies for the third-longest streak atop the poll. Only UConn (51 weeks) and Louisiana Tech (36) have had longer runs at No. 1.











            While South Carolina has had a stranglehold on No. 1 for more than a year, Indiana is making its first appearance ever at No. 2 after Stanford lost to Washington. 

            “I'm going to relish this for a minute, knowing where the program was to where it is,” Indiana coach Teri Moren said. “We've made a lot of history since we've been here in our nine seasons and it's one of the more historical things we've been able to accomplish. Give our players credit, I don't want to discount what a big achievement this is. We're more than humbled to be No. 2.”

            Indiana has won 10 straight since suffering its lone loss of the season to Michigan State. The Hoosiers have a tough stretch coming up, starting with a home game against No. 5 Iowa on Thursday. Indiana, which hadn't been ranked higher than fourth before Monday, then plays No. 13 Ohio State and 12th-ranked Michigan.

            “That's why we take it one game at a time, but you understand the magnitude of what's ahead of us. I tell the kids all the time we're in control of our own destiny,"" Moren said.

            LSU remained at No. 3 after close wins over Tennessee, Georgia and Texas A&M. The Tigers have a week to prepare for the Gamecocks.

            UConn moved up one spot to fourth after its close loss to the Gamecocks and Iowa was fifth.

            The Cardinal fell to sixth with Utah, Maryland, Duke and Notre Dame rounding out the top 10. The Blue Devils beat the Irish on Sunday to take over sole possession of first in the ACC and vault up seven spots in the poll. It's Duke's best ranking since the team finished the 2017 season ranked ninth.

            The NCAA will have its first reveal of the top 16 teams in the tournament to this point on Thursday.

            FALLING CYCLONES

            It was a rough week for Iowa State, which lost to Kansas by one point and Baylor by six. The Cyclones fell nine spots in the poll from 12th to 21st.

            RE-ENTRY

            Colorado came back into the poll at No. 25 after beating Oregon and Oregon State over the weekend. The Buffaloes were ranked for four weeks before falling out last week. Middle Tennessee dropped out of the poll after losing both its games last week.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802254,EU Parliament planning for possible Zelenksyy visit in days,"BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union's legislature was preparing plans Monday to host Volodymyr Zelenskyy should the Ukraine president decide to come to Brussels to attend an EU summit later this week. 

            Two sources in the parliament, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue, said such plans are only meant to prepare the legislature to host Zelenskyy if security conditions permit him to attend Thursday's meeting.

            “When he would come, we would be ready,” said one of the sources, stressing that because of security concerns any decision could only come at the last moment. 











            EU leaders from 27-nation bloc will be gathering for Thursday's summit in Brussels, enabling Zelenskyy to meet all major leaders of the bloc in one day. Zelenskyy has often addressed EU summits only through video calls from Ukraine. 

            Zelenskyy has long had an open invitation to come to Brussels if he chose to. 

            It remains unclear whether Zelenskyy would be able to travel as Russian forces are keeping Ukrainian troops tied down with attacks in the eastern Donbas region amid concern that of a new Russian offensive could be in the offing.

            EU Council President Charles Michel and Commission President Ursula von der Leyen visited Kyiv last Friday where they told Zelenskyy he had the bloc's unrelenting support in Ukraine's fight against Russia. 

            The only trip outside Ukraine that Zelenskyy has made was a visit to Washington in December to seek further aid for the war and to thank Ukraine's major financial and military back for its support.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802258,"Lubomir Strougal, Czechoslovak communist leader, dies at 98","PRAGUE (AP) — Lubomir Strougal, a Czechoslovak communist-era leader who served as prime minister for a record length of more than 18 years has died. He was 98.

            His death was confirmed to media by former Communist Party lawmaker Jiri Dolejs on Monday. No details were given.

            Strougal was appointed prime minister in 1970, when the country was ruled by a hard-line communist regime established following the 1968 Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia.











            Warsaw Pact troops invaded in August 1968 to crush political reforms and anti-communist protests during the era known as the Prague Spring.

            Strougal initially opposed the invasion but later joined the hard-liners.

            After Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev introduced a reform program known as ″perestroika,″ or restructuring, Strougal was considered a pragmatic reformer.

            But the hard-liners led by Milous Jakes prevailed, with Strougal resigning from his post in 1988 — a year before the Velvet Revolution led by Vaclav Havel ended more than 41 years of communist rule.

            Legal attempts after 1989 failed to hold Strougal responsible for the communist-era persecution and the deaths of people killed at Czechoslovakia's borders while trying to flee for the West.

            Born Oct 19, 1924 in Veseli nad Luznici, Strougal was a member of the Communist Party's leadership for three decades and also served as agriculture minister and interior minister before becoming prime minister.

            He retired from politics in 1989 and was expelled from the party a year later.PRAGUE (AP) — Lubomir Strougal, a Czechoslovak communist-era leader who served as prime minister for a record length of more than 18 years has died.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802260,How Manchester City came to face Premier League charges,"GENEVA (AP) — The English Premier League vs. Manchester City: a legal fixture for the ages.

            Soccer’s richest and most watched league challenged its defending champion on Monday with more than 100 charges of alleged financial wrongdoing and failures to cooperate with an investigation that took more than four years.

            Dozens of charges allege breaches of the league’s financial monitoring rules dating from 2009, or the first full season Man City was owned by the ruling family of Abu Dhabi. Thirty more charges relate to Man City’s lack of cooperation in the past five seasons with a Premier League investigation that opened after leaked, and likely hacked, club internal communications were published in 2018.











            That leaked evidence led UEFA investigators to examine likely breaches of financial rules designed to create stability in an often-volatile European soccer industry. UEFA-appointed judges imposed a two-year ban from the Champions League in 2020, which the club overturned on appeal at the Court of Arbitration for Sport.

            Man City seems more at risk from the English case, which does not involve a statute of limitations on evidence that was a problem for UEFA lawyers.

            The Premier League rule book — signed off by member clubs like Man City — gives its disciplinary commissions sweeping powers to punish teams if charges are proven. That could range from imposing a fine to taking away a title or even ejecting Man City from England's top division.

            Here's a closer look at the case:

            WHAT ARE THE FINANCIAL RULES?

            Known as Financial Fair Play, the regulations are aimed at preventing clubs from spending more than they earn. FFP was established in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis, which deepened worries in European soccer that clubs could go out of business if the cost of player transfers and wages kept rising. 

            Critics believed they would favor storied clubs with established global appeal, such as Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and Manchester United. They said FFP would be used to thwart emerging clubs who had wealthy owners ready to spend heavily and accelerate growth.

            At the same time, historically underachieving Manchester City was bought in September 2008 with sovereign wealth from the United Arab Emirates. When UEFA in 2011 began monitoring finances of clubs who qualified for European competition, City had made progress by spending big on players. 

            The first round of FFP judgments in 2014 saw the heaviest penalties for Man City and Paris Saint-Germain — each lost 20 million euros ($21.4 million) in Champions League prize money. 

            Both were suspected of booking inflated revenue in their accounts through sponsor deals at above market rates with companies from Abu Dhabi and Qatar.

            “If clubs use unrealistic deals as a way to get around Financial Fair Play,” Arsène Wenger had warned in 2012 when coach at Arsenal, ""it will make a mockery of the rules.” 

            The English Premier League later adopted a version of UEFA FFP rules.

            WHAT WAS THE LEAKED EVIDENCE?

            In November 2018, Man City was the Premier League champion with three titles in the first decade of its Abu Dhabi era, and a talented squad coached by Pep Guardiola.

            Yet skepticism remained about the club's commercial results.

            German magazine Der Spiegel then published the “Football Leaks” series of articles based on the club's internal documents and communications.

            They suggested Man City had broken FFP rules in financial relationships with ""related-party"" sponsors from Abu Dhabi, its use of image rights payments to players and the contract of Roberto Mancini, who was manager from 2009-13. He allegedly doubled his base salary for advising a club in Abu Dhabi.

            Man City did not deny the documents were authentic but said they were illegally obtained by a Portuguese man, Rui Pinto. He later went on trial in Lisbon. A verdict is scheduled in April.

            WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE UEFA CASE?

            After the Football Leaks publication, UEFA’s club investigators revisited their case and asked the judging chamber to ban Man City from European competitions.

            In February 2020, those judges banned Man City for two seasons for “serious breaches” of rules from 2012-16, including overstating sponsor revenue and failing to cooperate with investigators.

            Three CAS judges overturned the ban in July 2020, ruling that some UEFA charged were not proven and other evidence was excluded as time-barred. The court “strongly condemned” Man City for obstructing UEFA’s investigation, though a €10 million ($10.7 million) fine was one-third of the original punishment.

            Allowed to play in the next Champions League, Man City reached the final and earned 119 million euros ($128 million) in prize money. 

            WHAT IS THE PREMIER LEAGUE CASE?

            The English case against Man City continued separately from the UEFA process in Switzerland.

            The Premier League announced charges Monday. A lawyer who chairs the league’s judicial panel will appoint a disciplinary commission of three judges.

            A hearing will be held in secret, with no timetable yet for a verdict. Any subsequent legal challenge should go to the Premier League’s Appeal Board.

            Man City said it was surprised by the charges and “we look forward to this matter being put to rest once and for all.”

The court “strongly condemned” Man City for obstructing UEFA’s investigation, though a €10 million ($10.7 million) fine was one-third of the original punishment.Allowed to play in the next Champions League, Man City reached the final and earned 119 million euros ($128 million) in prize money.WHAT IS THE PREMIER LEAGUE CASE?The English case against Man City continued separately from the UEFA process in Switzerland.The Premier League announced charges Monday. A lawyer who chairs the league’s judicial panel will appoint a disciplinary commission of three judges.A hearing will be held in secret, with no timetable yet for a verdict. Any subsequent legal challenge should go to the Premier League’s Appeal Board.Man City said it was surprised by the charges and “we look forward to this matter being put to rest once and for all.”___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/2/7,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802262,Column: Sloppy race clouds NASCAR's return to LA Coliseum,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Bubba Wallace said his back and neck hurt following the bumping and banging of NASCAR’s first event of the new year, an exhibition that Kyle Larson called “very violent for the majority of the race.”

            Austin Dillon was shocked at the aggressiveness shown Sunday night at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, especially early in the race, when he found his head going “bang, bang, back and forth, every corner"" in a sloppy, caution-filled game of bumper cars.

            “There was nothing but just hammer each other and hope to come out the other side,” said Dillon, who added that he told new teammate Kyle Busch that the steering wheel was knocked out of his hands on a particularly hard hit to the back of his Chevrolet. “You’re taking some pretty good blows out there and trying to stay calm.”











            NASCAR brought its preseason Busch Light Clash back to the Coliseum for a second consecutive year to race on a temporary quarter-mile track inside the iconic venue. The show was a smashing success a year ago — NASCAR used heat races, last-chance qualifiers, a prerace concert and a halftime show — to dazzle a new audience that included a packed USC student section.

            It was going to be impossible to duplicate the success this year — even with a Wiz Khalifa halftime set — but it wasn't supposed to be so messy. The inaugural event had just five cautions; Sunday night was marred by 25 cautions and a long stretch after the seven-minute Wiz Khalifa set in which the drivers struggled to complete two consecutive laps under green.

            The racing was so amateur that it probably killed any chance of turning a third trip to the Coliseum into a points-awarding race, which seemed plausible just a day earlier. Auto Club Speedway in nearby Fontana is set to be renovated following its Cup race later this month, and its track president said the facility wouldn't be ready to host racing in 2024.

            The absence of Auto Club next year puts pressure on NASCAR to remain in the Southern California market, and “a race that counts” at the Coliseum could have filled the void. But the drivers blasted that idea.

            Martin Truex Jr., who went winless last season and nearly retired, won Sunday night and gave a flat “No,” when asked if the race should count in the future. The Clash was run at Daytona International Speedway from its 1979 inception until last year, when NASCAR moved it to the Coliseum because, frankly, a special race wasn't so special anymore at Daytona.

            The Coliseum idea was fresh and new, and it energized the industry for the start of an important season in which NASCAR launched a new car. The Clash at the Coliseum is what it is, Truex said, and if it's messy and sloppy, so be it.

            “Why would you want to screw it up and make it a points race? It’s like a one-off deal,” he said, noting that at Daytona the ever-changing eligibility rules made a boring race “all weird.”

            “Now this is really cool. It’s got its own identity, fun race, all the way out here in a cool venue that’s got a lot of history,” Truex said of the Coliseum. “I think it’s kind of got a good vibe to it now. Let’s not maybe screw that up.”

            But a secondary theme emerged at the Coliseum, as most drivers believed that an offseason fix NASCAR made to the rear bumper of its Next Gen car was not such a fix after all. The rear of the new car was designed to withstand hard hits, but the durability and rigidness of the rear clip left the driver absorbing far more energy than normal in routine crashes.

            It led to at least two concussions, and Kurt Busch was forced to retire because of a July crash in qualifying. He said last week that he was in nine crashes in 2022 in which the force of impact alarmed Busch and he’s still not 100% healthy.

            NASCAR made some fixes to soften the rear, but Wallace sounded the alarm early Sunday night when he was hit from behind.

            “Uh NASCAR, rear bumper hits are still (expletive) awful,” he said on his radio.

            Kyle Busch said Wallace's rear bumper was visibly damaged, “so he might have been one of the ones that got hit the hardest."" He also agreed with Larson and Dillon, who said the violence inside the car ""still doesn’t feel good.”

            “Truthfully, it didn’t really feel much different at that speed and just the bumper car action that you get through the middle of the corner,” Kyle Busch said. “Like Austin said, when you get hit a few times, your head is getting jacked into the back of the headrest and you’re getting the whiplash effect. But (the lack of) damage to the cars... like front and rear, underneath, you have no idea (it was a hard hit). But it’s still a brunt of a hit.”

            Next up is the Daytona 500, where top speeds will be more than double the roughly 80-plus mph the drivers were doing at the Coliseum. And, the nature of the racing at Daytona typically requires one driver to slam into the back of the car in front of him to create the force needed to move through traffic.

            But if the drivers are concerned, they didn’t go out of their way Sunday night to sound the alarm.

            “I think the positive part is NASCAR has showed us things that they’re trying to do to help that area of the car,” Dillon said. “We’re making progress. That’s the biggest thing.”

            The progress remains to be seen, both with how NASCAR ultimately views its return to the Coliseum and if it has done enough headed into a new season to protect its drivers.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802263,Chiefs activate RB Edwards-Helaire off IR for Super Bowl,"KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — The Kansas City Chiefs activated running back Clyde Edwards-Helaire from injured reserve Monday and placed wide receiver Mecole Hardman on the list for the second time as they finalize their roster for the Super Bowl.

            Edwards-Helaire, a 2020 first-round pick, has been out since sustaining a high ankle sprain during a win over the Chargers on Nov. 20. He was designated to return on Jan. 17, opening a three-week window in which he could be activated.

            Edwards-Helaire started the first six games of the season before ceding time to seventh-round pick Isiah Pacheco, who has become one of the Chiefs' breakout stars. Edwards-Helaire has run 71 times for 302 yards and three touchdowns and caught 17 passes for 151 yards and three more scores this season.











            The emergence of Pacheco, along with veteran Jerick McKinnon, took pressure off the Chiefs to activate Edwards-Helaire before he was ready. Pacheco ran for 830 yards and five TDs during the regular season along with 121 combined rushing yards in playoff wins over Jacksonville and Cincinnati, while McKinnon scored 10 combined touchdowns in the regular season.

            Hardman, who will be a free agent after the season, initially hurt his pelvis Nov. 6 during a game against the Titans. He was activated from IR on Jan. 4 but struggled to get healthy enough to appear in games, missing the Chiefs' regular-season finale against the Raiders and their divisional win over the Jaguars.

            He finally suited up for the AFC title game against the Bengals, and he ran a couple of jet sweeps while catching two passes for 10 yards. It was while getting tackled on his second reception that Hardman reinjured the pelvis.

            Hardman was among three wide receivers hurt in the game, forcing the Chiefs to use a patchwork group down the stretch. 

            JuJu Smith-Schuster had one catch for 7 yards before inflammation in his knee forced him to the sideline, and Kadarius Toney had one catch for 9 yards before spraining his ankle while attempting to make a cut.

            Neither participated in practice last week before the team departed Sunday for Phoenix, though coach Andy Reid expressed optimism that they would be available for the Super Bowl. 

            The Chiefs also should get back wide receiver Justin Watson, who was inactive for the AFC title game because of an illness.

            “(Smith-Schuster) is in a good place,” Reid said. “The main thing is that we let that calm down. And right now, it's doing great, so very optimistic right now. And his want-to is all in there. But we'll just see where it goes.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802264,AMC to charge more for good seats in movie theaters,"NEW YORK (AP) — Middle seats at many U.S. movie theaters just got more expensive. 

            AMC Theaters, the nation's largest movie theater chain, on Monday unveiled a new pricing scheme in which seat location determines how much your movie ticket costs. Seats in the middle of the auditorium will cost a dollar or two more, while seats in the front row will be slightly cheaper. 

            AMC said the pricing plan, dubbed “Sightline,” has already been rolled out in some locations and, by the end of the year, will be in place at all domestic AMC theaters during showings after 4 p.m. 











            Seats classified as “standard sightline” will be at the regular price. If you want to pay less for the “value sightline” seats, you have to be a member of the chain's subscription service, AMC Stubs. 

            As movie theaters have attempted to recover from the pandemic, exhibitors have increasingly looked at more variable pricing methods. That's included charging more for sought-after movies like “The Batman” in their first week of release. 

            Last weekend, Paramount Pictures partnered with theater chains to offer slightly reduced ticket prices for the comedy “80 for Brady.” And last year, during a dry spell in theaters, tickets at most movie theaters were $3 for “National Cinema Day.”

            But in most circumstances, movie tickets are getting more expensive, especially when factoring in large-format screens and 3D showings. The average 3D premium format ticket for the biggest box-office hit in recent years, “Avatar: The Way of Water,” was about $16.50.NEW YORK (AP) — Middle seats at many U.S. movie theaters just got more expensive.AMC Theaters, the nation's largest movie theater chain, on Monday unveiled a new pricing scheme in which seat location determines how much your movie ticket costs.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802265,Meta to buy VR startup Within after favorable court ruling,"A federal judge has sided with Facebook parent Meta and cleared the way for the company to buy virtual reality startup Within Unlimited, the maker of the popular fitness app Supernatural.

            Federal antitrust regulators had sought to block the acquisition on the grounds that it would hurt competition in the emerging virtual reality market. 

            But U.S. District Judge Edward Davila denied the Federal Trade Commission’s request for a preliminary injunction against the deal. The judge's ruling said the agency did not provide sufficient evidence to prove its case. 











            Meta said it will now proceed with its acquisition of Within Unlimited.

            The FTC had argued that Meta’s acquisition of the small company — reminiscent of Facebook's early purchases of Instagram and WhatsApp — would hurt competition in the emerging virtual reality market. 

            Allowing the tech giant to buy Los Angeles-based Within Unlimited, the FTC had argued, would violate antitrust laws and dampen innovation, hurting consumers who may face higher prices and fewer options outside of Meta-controlled platforms.

            Meta Platforms Inc. said in a statement late Friday after the ruling was unsealed that it is “pleased” with the decision. 

            “This deal will bring pro-competitive benefits to the ecosystem and spur innovation that will benefit people, developers, and the VR space more broadly,” the company based in Menlo Park, California, said. ""We look forward to closing the transaction soon.” 

            The FTC had argued that Meta scrapped its own plans to enter the nascent VR fitness market in the summer of 2021 when it decided to buy Within Unlimited. Without the competitive threat of the tech giant’s entry into the market on its own, the agency asserts, innovation stalls, hurting end users.

            “The threat is what keeps firms going,” testified economist Hal Singer, a witness for the FTC. “If I know there is a chance that someone could come in and steal my lunch,” he said, companies will innovate and constrain pricing.

            But Meta executives — including CEO Mark Zuckerberg — sought to play down the notion that the company was anywhere close to creating its own VR fitness app. The Meta CEO testified that even though his company was “looking at” developing its own VR fitness app before deciding to acquire Within Unlimited in 2021, the business environment has changed and “there is almost no chance” it would start such a project today.

            Under Zuckerberg’s, Meta moved aggressively into virtual reality in 2014 with its acquisition of headset maker Oculus VR. Since then, Meta’s VR headsets have become the cornerstone of its growth in the virtual reality space, the FTC noted in its suit. Fueled by the popularity of its top-selling Quest headsets, Meta’s Quest Store has become a leading U.S. app platform with more than 500 apps available to download, according to the agency.

            Meta bought seven of the most successful virtual-reality development studios, and now has one of the largest virtual-reality content catalogs in the world, the FTC noted.

            Davila's ruling, however, says the FTC needed to provide “at least circumstantial evidence” that Meta's entry into the VR fitness market by itself, not via the acquisition, would have directly and favorably affected consumers by encouraging robust competition.

            “Under this standard, the FTC’s evidence on this element is insufficient,"" Davila wrote.

            Representatives for the FTC did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment on Monday.

            Davila also oversaw the trial of disgraced Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes and her partner Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani. Both were sentenced to over a decade in prison for their roles in the company’s blood-testing hoax.A federal judge has sided with Facebook parent Meta and cleared the way for the company to buy virtual reality startup Within Unlimited, the maker of the popular fitness app Supernatural.Federal antitrust regulators had sought to block the acquisition on the grounds that it would hurt competition in the emerging virtual reality market.But U.S. District Judge Edward Davila denied the Federal Trade Commission’s request for a preliminary injunction against the deal.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802266,Justin Rose wins at Pebble Beach to end 4-year drought,"PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. (AP) — Justin Rose had a different set of goals at the start of the year.

            His back was starting to become bothersome. His world ranking sank to its lowest point in 13 years. And he had reason to wonder if he would spend the first full week in April somewhere other than Augusta National.

            All that changed Monday morning when Rose capped off a long week at the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am with three quick birdies and four steady pars that gave him a three-shot victory, his first in four years.











            Along with the crystal trophy — his 11th on the PGA Tour, 23rd worldwide — and the $1.62 million prize comes an invitation to the Masters. Rose has been eligible for every major dating to St. Andrews in 2010, a streak he did not want to end.

            “Augusta's definitely been a big part of being on my mind,” Rose said after closing with a 6-under 66 in cool but pristine conditions at Pebble Beach. ""I thought the simple way to approach it was try to play my way into the top 50 in the world ... claw my way up the world rankings and make it that way.

            “Obviously this,” he said, tapping the crystal on a table next to him, “is a better way to make it by winning a tournament. So yeah, big relief from that point of view.”

            The wind-delayed tournament forced a Monday finish, and Rose had staked himself to a two-shot lead Sunday night with an eagle-birdie-par stretch along the ocean.

            And then he delivered a knockout punch early to as many as a dozen players who were within three shots of the lead at various points on the course.

            After a good two-putt par on the 10th to resume his round, Rose holed a 25-foot birdie putt on the 11th, a 20-foot birdie putt on the 13th and then hit a wedge to the back shelf on the par-5 14th to 8 feet for a third birdie.

            From there, it was about playing it safe and soaking up the views.

            For all the weather this week — and it was everything, all the time — the final three hours featured a stunning blue sky and big surf, waves crashing into the rocks and adding to a scenery that already is among the best in golf.

            Rose finished three shots clear of Brendon Todd (65) and Brandon Wu (66).

            “An incredible week from start to finish with so much happening in my favor,” Rose said.

            The 42-year-old from England had not won since Torrey Pines in 2019, when he was No. 1 in the world. He finished last year at No. 76, his lowest point since early in 2010.

            “Amazing how long it's been,” said Rose, whose victory moved him to No. 35.

            The back nine, so difficult in the final hours Sunday evening, was hardly a threat Monday morning. The wind was light and coming from the opposite direction, if anything at the players' backs instead of into them.

            The weather played a big role all week, and no one benefited quite like Rose.

            He was six shots out of the lead and going nowhere, facing the strongest wind of the week on the Shore course at Monterey Peninsula, when he hit 5-wood into the par-3 ninth to 3 feet. Before he could mark his ball, the wind blew it some 4 feet farther away.

            That was enough for officials to halt play — the ninth and 15th greens at Monterey Peninsula were the problems — on all three courses in the rotation. Rose returned Sunday morning and made what then was a 7-foot birdie putt.

            What would have been the odds of him winning if golf balls — his and others — were not blowing around at that point?

            “It hurts them considerably. Yeah, that was a break,” Rose said. “I guess if you are out here long enough on tour, occasionally you catch a good break. So that was a good one.”

            He played those final 10 holes in 6 under for a 65 to take the lead, and then a pivotal stretch Sunday evening gave him a cushion. Rose took it from there, a masterclass weekend of iron play and great putting.

            Denny McCarthy was two shots behind when play resumed and had birdie chances on the 16th and 17th that he couldn't covert. He wound up with a 64 and finished four shots behind, along with Keith Mitchell (68) and Peter Malnati (69).

            This week of weather was more about wind than rain, although Pebble offered a little of everything. At one point on Sunday, there was rain, wind, hail and sunshine, all within a one-hour window.

            That was all a distant memory when Rose finished with a smile as bright as the sun.

            “Just that walk up 18, to be able to build a bit of a lead, to kind of enjoy it, was a very special moment,” he said. “Think when you're a bit starved for a win as well, the fact that it came today on a weather day like we had and at a venue that we had today was just worth waiting for.”

            AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsPEBBLE BEACH, Calif. (AP) — Justin Rose had a different set of goals at the start of the year.His back was starting to become bothersome. His world ranking sank to its lowest point in 13 years. And he had reason to wonder if he would spend the first full week in April somewhere other than Augusta National.All that changed Monday morning when Rose capped off a long week at the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am with three quick birdies and four steady pars that gave him a three-shot victory, his first in four years.Along with the crystal trophy — his 11th on the PGA Tour, 23rd worldwide — and the $1.62 million prize comes an invitation to the Masters. Rose has been eligible for every major dating to St. Andrews in 2010, a streak he did not want to end.“Augusta's definitely been a big part of being on my mind,” Rose said after closing with a 6-under 66 in cool but pristine conditions at Pebble Beach. ""I thought the simple way to approach it was try to play my way into the top 50 in the world ... claw my way up the world rankings and make it that way.“Obviously this,” he said, tapping the crystal on a table next to him, “is a better way to make it by winning a tournament. So yeah, big relief from that point of view.”The wind-delayed tournament forced a Monday finish, and Rose had staked himself to a two-shot lead Sunday night with an eagle-birdie-par stretch along the ocean.And then he delivered a knockout punch early to as many as a dozen players who were within three shots of the lead at various points on the course.After a good two-putt par on the 10th to resume his round, Rose holed a 25-foot birdie putt on the 11th, a 20-foot birdie putt on the 13th and then hit a wedge to the back shelf on the par-5 14th to 8 feet for a third birdie.From there, it was about playing it safe and soaking up the views.For all the weather this week — and it was everything, all the time — the final three hours featured a stunning blue sky and big surf, waves crashing into the rocks and adding to a scenery that already is among the best in golf.Rose finished three shots clear of Brendon Todd (65) and Brandon Wu (66).“An incredible week from start to finish with so much happening in my favor,” Rose said.The 42-year-old from England had not won since Torrey Pines in 2019, when he was No. 1 in the world. He finished last year at No. 76, his lowest point since early in 2010.“Amazing how long it's been,” said Rose, whose victory moved him to No. 35.The back nine, so difficult in the final hours Sunday evening, was hardly a threat Monday morning. The wind was light and coming from the opposite direction, if anything at the players' backs instead of into them.The weather played a big role all week, and no one benefited quite like Rose.He was six shots out of the lead and going nowhere, facing the strongest wind of the week on the Shore course at Monterey Peninsula, when he hit 5-wood into the par-3 ninth to 3 feet.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802267,Legal sizes for lobsters could change to protect population,"PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — The rules about the minimum and maximum sizes of lobsters that can be trapped off New England could soon become stricter, potentially bringing big changes to one of the most valuable seafood industries in the country.

            Fishers are required to measure lobsters from eyes to tail and must throw back the crustaceans if they're too large or too small. The rules, which can vary slightly based on fishing grounds, are intended to maintain a breeding population of the lobsters in key areas such as the Gulf of Maine and Georges Bank.

            The regulatory Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission is considering changing the standards by a fraction of an inch in some of the fishing grounds. The commission said it's considering the changes because of a worrisome lack of baby lobsters growing off New England.











            The changes would arrive at a time when the lobster industry is experiencing record highs in both catch and value, and consumers are paying more for lobsters — already a premium product — than they were just a few years ago. The industry is also challenged by warming oceans and new fishing rules designed to protect rare whales.

            Recent surveys that show declining levels of young lobsters are a concern for the future of the fishery, said Caitlin Starks, senior fishery management plan coordinator for the commission.

            “Those numbers were declining,” Starks said. “The levels of new lobsters recruiting into the fishery were particularly low, and there was concern that was going to foreshadow decline.”

            The commission is soliciting public comment on the proposal and plans to hold public hearings about it in March, Starks said. The changes would affect lobster fishers from Maine to the waters off southern New England, and the hearings will be held in those places, Starks said.

            Changes could be implemented by fall 2024 if they are approved, Starks said.

            Lobster fishing groups such as the Massachusetts Lobstermen's Association are following the developments, said Beth Casoni, executive director of the group. The association doesn't have a stance yet because the exact specifications of the proposed changes are still to come, she said.

            “We're waiting to see what the preferred management options are,” Casoni said.

            The size of the U.S. lobster catch has increased dramatically in the last 15 years. The catch in Maine, which is by far the largest producer of lobsters, is typically more than 100 million pounds (45 million kilograms) per year. Fishermen had never even eclipsed 80 million pounds (36 million kilograms) in a single year as recently as 2008.

            But the population of lobsters off southern New England has crashed. And scientists who perform surveys of baby lobsters from eastern Canada to Long Island, New York, have found a below average number of them settling on the ocean bottom in areas such as the Gulf of Maine since 2012, the commission said in a statement.

            “Given the economic importance of the lobster fishery to many coastal communities in New England, especially in Maine, potential reductions in landings could have vast socioeconomic impacts,” the statement said.

            Canadian fishers harvest the same species of lobster and have their own measurement standards, which throws a wrinkle into efforts to manage the population.

            The rationale for changing the U.S. measurement standards is that it gives lobsters more opportunity to reproduce, said Richard Wahle, a marine science professor at University of Maine who directs the Lobster Institute at the university. The change would also have ramifications such as marketing consequences for the U.S.-Canada trade, he said.

            More restrictive measurement guidelines “would be consistent with the precautionary approach to hedge bets against poor year classes,"" Wahle said.PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — The rules about the minimum and maximum sizes of lobsters that can be trapped off New England could soon become stricter, potentially bringing big changes to one of the most valuable seafood industries in the country.Fishers are required to measure lobsters from eyes to tail and must throw back the crustaceans if they're too large or too small.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802268,Hurricane deaths at nursing home: accident or manslaughter?,"FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla (AP) — A Florida nursing home administrator charged with causing the overheating deaths of nine patients after Hurricane Irma in 2017 went on trial Monday, with a prosecutor calling him a “captain who abandoned ship” while his attorney said he's a “scapegoat” for failures of the electric company to restore power.

            Prosecutor Chris Killoran told the six-member jury that Jorge Carballo is guilty of manslaughter because he failed to give adequate direction to his staff at the Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hills after power to the facility's air conditioning system was lost. He said Carballo went home even as it became “ridiculously hot” inside the 150-bed, two-story facility and failed to order his patients' evacuation to Memorial Regional Hospital across the street, which had working air conditioning. 

            Prosecutors must prove Carballo acted recklessly and showed gross and careless disregard for his patients' safety. Carballo, 65, could face 15 years in prison if convicted, although a sentence of that length would be unlikely as he has no previous record. He was originally charged with 12 deaths, but three cases have been dropped. Charges were also dropped against three of his employees, who will testify against him.











            “This is a case of a captain who abandoned his slowly sinking ship, and left not only his crew but the passengers to fend for themselves,” Killoran said. As temperatures rose inside the center, Carballo “basically did nothing,” he said.

            “He had his staff buy some fans to push some hot air around and had some portable AC units installed,” he said, but that wasn't done properly, making the temperatures on the second floor where the deaths occurred even worse. 

            But defense attorney James Cobb said Carballo did everything within his power to protect his patients. He had his staff notify Florida Power & Light that the air conditioning's power was down right after it happened and several more times over the next two days, Cobb said, but the company didn't send a crew until an executive saw news reports about patients dying. He said the problem took 10 minutes to fix.

            He said Carballo was following published research that shows moving frail, elderly patients comes with a high risk of death.

            “This case can be boiled down to one word — scapegoat,"" Cobb said. The attorney previously won the acquittal of two New Orleans nursing home owners who were charged after 35 patients drowned during flooding in 2005 after Hurricane Katrina.

            Cobb, scoffing at Killoran's characterization of Carballo abandoning ship, showed the jury two photos of Carballo working with his staff during the emergency. He said Carballo is on trial to avoid placing the blame where it belongs — on the power company.

            “Hurricanes are unpredictable. Stuff happens during hurricanes that can't be planned for. If something happens that can't be planned for, you do the best you can,” he said. 

            The victims, ranging in age from 57 to 99, had body temperatures of up to 108 degrees (42 degrees celsius), paramedics have reported. 

            The deaths began three days after Irma knocked out a transformer that powered the cooling system. Otherwise, the facility never lost power.

            A state report said that before the storm hit on Sept. 10, 2017, Carballo and his staff made appropriate preparations. They purchased extra food and water and fuel for the generator.

            Administrators also participated in statewide conference calls with regulators, including one where then-Gov. Rick Scott said nursing homes should call his cellphone for help.

            After the air conditioner failed, Carballo and his facility manager contacted the power company. When that didn’t work, they called Scott’s cellphone and county and city officials. No help came.

            Temperatures that week were in the upper 80s (about 31 degrees Celsius). On Sept. 12, two days after the storm, patients from the nursing home began arriving at Memorial Regional's emergency room with temperatures of 103 degrees (39.4 Celsius) and above. 

            About 6 a.m. on Sept. 13, after more patients arrived, Memorial's then-head nurse Judy Frum and her assistant, Tracy Meltzer, walked to the home to offer assistance. Both testified Monday that when they entered, the heat struck them and the home's staff seemed frantic. Paramedics were already there. 

            “It was really hot. I can only relate it to opening a car door and the heat hits you in the face,” Frum said. 

            Meltzer said that when she reached the second floor, she found two men dead in one room and a woman lying in a diaper filled with urine and feces. She heard one of the home's nurses say, “They are dropping like flies. We have to get these people out of here.” After she, Frum and paramedics conversed, the fire department decided to evacuate the home and take everyone to the hospital, where a mass casualty alert was called.

            “Patients were being compromised to the heat. Some were expired. We made a group decision to take patients out of the building,” Frum said.

            Under cross-examination, Carballo attorney David Frankel tried to get Frum and Meltzer to concede that they over-reacted and that the patients would have been better off staying at the home. At one point, Frankel insinuated that by calling a mass casualty alert, the nurses had attracted national media attention to the situation it otherwise wouldn't have received. 

            Frum and Meltzer responded they could feel the heat, see dead patients and others in distress. 

            “It was not a safe place to be. We removed the patients from harm,"" Frum said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802269,Family demands answers over 'Cop City' activist's death,"DECATUR, Ga. (AP) — The environmental activist killed by authorities in an Atlanta-area forest last month was shot at least a dozen times, the slain protester’s family said Monday while urging officials to release more information about the death of the 26-year-old who went by the name Tortuguita.

            The news conference was held outside a Decatur courthouse just as a large contingent of law enforcement officers accompanied contractors and heavy equipment near the South River Forest about 6 miles (10 kilometers) away, to begin clearing the woods for a planned police and firefighter training center that opponents call “Cop City,"" news outlets reported.

            The Georgia Bureau of Investigation has said officers killed Tortuguita in self-defense on Jan. 18 after the protester, whose given name was Manuel Esteban Paez Terán, shot a state trooper while authorities cleared activists from the forested site.











            Tortuguita’s mother, father and brother, as well as their attorneys, said the GBI has been silent instead of responding to the family’s pleas for information about last month's fatal shooting.

            Civil rights attorney Jeff Filipovits said the details offered by authorities so far do not make sense with those who knew Tortuguita to be a “kind (and) compassionate person,"" — not a “domestic terrorist,” a charge that has been filed in recent months against nearly 20 protesters accused of being part of the leftist “Stop Cop City"" movement. 

            “The family needs answers,” Filipovits said. “So far we've had selective information released by the GBI. They are not answering questions. They are not providing the family with any information to understand what happened in the forest.”

            The GBI has said no body camera or dashcam footage of the shooting exists, and that ballistics evidence shows that the injured trooper was shot with a bullet from a gun that Tortuguita had legally purchased in 2020.

            Filipovits said the GBI refuses to say whether there was any audio or video recordings from drones, helicopters or other surveillance cameras that could have been in use during the incident.

            Following the news conference, the GBI released a statement asking for patience, saying it is “not releasing any videos currently because agents are continuing to conduct key interviews and want to maintain the integrity of the investigation.” 

            “We owe it to the Trooper and (Paez) Teran to complete a thorough investigation,” the GBI said. “When we began our case, we contacted and spoke with (Paez) Teran’s family. We intend to follow up with the family as the investigation progresses.”

            Filipovits' law partner Brian Spears said that Tortuguita’s body was released to the family last week and that they had an independent autopsy conducted. They said the autopsy found that Tortuguita was shot 12 or 13 times, perhaps more, from multiple firearms.

            The protester's body was “riddled with bullets,” Spears said.

            City Council approved the $90 million Atlanta Public Safety Training Center in 2021, saying a state-of-the-art campus would replace substandard offerings and boost police morale, which is beset by hiring and retention struggles in the wake of violent protests against racial injustice that roiled the city after George Floyd’s death in 2020.

            In addition to classrooms and administrative buildings, the training center would include a shooting range, a driving course to practice chases and a “burn building” for firefighters to work on putting out fires. A “mock village” featuring a fake home, convenience store and nightclub would also be built for authorities to rehearse raids.

            Tortuguita had moved from Florida months ago to join the activists in the woods who had been protesting for over a year by camping out at the site and building platforms in surrounding trees.

            Self-described “forest defenders” say that building the 85-acre (34-hectare) training center would involve cutting down so many trees that it would be environmentally damaging. They also oppose investing so much money in a project which they say will be used to practice “urban warfare.”

            Tortuguita chose the moniker – which is Spanish for “Little Turtle” – over their given name.

            “Manuel was a warrior for the whole of humanity,"" Tortuguita’s father Joel Paez said Monday. “I told him, 'Manuel, you cannot worry about the whole world ... You are not Greta Thunberg.’ I was wrong.”

            Tortuguita's death prompted a large Jan. 21 demonstration in downtown Atlanta that erupted into violence as a masked contingent lit a police cruiser on fire, and threw rocks and launched fireworks at a skyscraper that houses the Atlanta Police Foundation, shattering windows. No injuries were reported, but six people were arrested that night and charged with domestic terrorism.

            Since then, local officials have vowed to continue to move forward with the project, with Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens announcing last week that land disturbance permits had been approved for the project.

            The GBI said in a news release that authorities from multiple law enforcement agencies conducted a clearing operation of the site Monday as part of “an ongoing effort to ensure that the site of the future City of Atlanta Public Safety Training Center is safe and secure.” The GBI said no arrests were made.DECATUR, Ga.

They are not providing the family with any information to understand what happened in the forest.”The GBI has said no body camera or dashcam footage of the shooting exists, and that ballistics evidence shows that the injured trooper was shot with a bullet from a gun that Tortuguita had legally purchased in 2020.Filipovits said the GBI refuses to say whether there was any audio or video recordings from drones, helicopters or other surveillance cameras that could have been in use during the incident.Following the news conference, the GBI released a statement asking for patience, saying it is “not releasing any videos currently because agents are continuing to conduct key interviews and want to maintain the integrity of the investigation.”“We owe it to the Trooper and (Paez) Teran to complete a thorough investigation,” the GBI said. “When we began our case, we contacted and spoke with (Paez) Teran’s family. We intend to follow up with the family as the investigation progresses.”Filipovits' law partner Brian Spears said that Tortuguita’s body was released to the family last week and that they had an independent autopsy conducted. They said the autopsy found that Tortuguita was shot 12 or 13 times, perhaps more, from multiple firearms.The protester's body was “riddled with bullets,” Spears said.City Council approved the $90 million Atlanta Public Safety Training Center in 2021, saying a state-of-the-art campus would replace substandard offerings and boost police morale, which is beset by hiring and retention struggles in the wake of violent protests against racial injustice that roiled the city after George Floyd’s death in 2020.In addition to classrooms and administrative buildings, the training center would include a shooting range, a driving course to practice chases and a “burn building” for firefighters to work on putting out fires. A “mock village” featuring a fake home, convenience store and nightclub would also be built for authorities to rehearse raids.Tortuguita had moved from Florida months ago to join the activists in the woods who had been protesting for over a year by camping out at the site and building platforms in surrounding trees.Self-described “forest defenders” say that building the 85-acre (34-hectare) training center would involve cutting down so many trees that it would be environmentally damaging. They also oppose investing so much money in a project which they say will be used to practice “urban warfare.”Tortuguita chose the moniker – which is Spanish for “Little Turtle” – over their given name.“Manuel was a warrior for the whole of humanity,"" Tortuguita’s father Joel Paez said Monday. “I told him, 'Manuel, you cannot worry about the whole world ... You are not Greta Thunberg.’ I was wrong.”Tortuguita's death prompted a large Jan. 21 demonstration in downtown Atlanta that erupted into violence as a masked contingent lit a police cruiser on fire, and threw rocks and launched fireworks at a skyscraper that houses the Atlanta Police Foundation, shattering windows. No injuries were reported, but six people were arrested that night and charged with domestic terrorism.Since then, local officials have vowed to continue to move forward with the project, with Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens announcing last week that land disturbance permits had been approved for the project.The GBI said in a news release that authorities from multiple law enforcement agencies conducted a clearing operation of the site Monday as part of “an ongoing effort to ensure that the site of the future City of Atlanta Public Safety Training Center is safe and secure.” The GBI said no arrests were made.",2023/2/7,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802270,Kentucky Bourbon Trail attendance reaches record heights,"FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) — Bourbon tourism reached new heights last year in Kentucky, where visitors flocked to large and small distilleries as the whiskey-making attractions shook off any pandemic-era hangover.

            Attendance at distilleries along the Kentucky Bourbon Trail surpassed 2 million in 2022 for the first time ever, the Kentucky Distillers' Association announced. Venerable bourbon producers and industry newcomers alike benefited from the surge. 

            Total visits exceeded 2.1 million last year, easily beating the pre-pandemic record of 1.7 million stops in 2019, the distillers' group said. In the past decade, the “amber adventure” has had a 370% surge in attendance — a boon to the state known around the world for bourbon production, it said.











            “The success of Kentucky’s bourbon industry isn’t slowing down anytime soon,"" Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said.

            The distillers' association created the Kentucky Bourbon Trail in 1999 to give visitors an intimate, educational look behind the state’s most historic distilleries. Total attendance at its 18 participating distilleries nearly reached 1.4 million last year, the group said.

            The Kentucky Bourbon Trail Craft Tour launched in 2012 to showcase smaller distilleries had its best year. Now featuring 24 distilleries, its total attendance last year was 738,287.

            Spirit companies have invested huge sums into new or expanded visitor centers to play up the industry’s heritage and allow guests to soak in the sights and smells of bourbon-making.

            During the height of the pandemic, distilleries in the region were closed temporarily to visitors.

            Some producers eased back into tourism by allowing limited numbers of visitors. Once virus restrictions were lifted, bourbon tourism bounced back with a full resurgence.

            Research shows that bourbon tourists tend to be younger, spend between $400 and $1,200 on their trip, travel in large groups, and stay longer than the average visitor to Kentucky, the distillers' association said. More than 70% of visitors are from outside Kentucky.

            “This is a home run demographic for local communities, generating valuable revenue and tax dollars while boosting a hospitality industry that’s still recovering from the COVID pandemic,” said Kentucky Distillers' Association President Eric Gregory.

            To encourage responsible drinking on the tour, distilleries offer water and nonalcoholic beverages and many have food or snacks available. The association said it promotes the use of designated drivers and transportation companies to stem impaired driving. Also, state law restricts free sample sizes at distilleries and many voluntarily limit cocktail sales at their in-house bar or restaurant, the distillers' group said. 

            The growth in bourbon tourism has created some challenges. Most distilleries now require reservations, so booking stops in advance is crucial, said Mandy Ryan, director of the association's Kentucky Bourbon Trail experiences.

            Kentucky now boasts more than 11.4 million barrels of bourbon aging in warehouses across the state, the most in its storied distilling history, the association said. Distillers filled more than 2.6 million barrels last year, marking the fourth straight year production topped the 2 million mark.FRANKFORT, Ky.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802271,Haiti appoints council amid push to hold general elections,"PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — Haiti’s prime minister on Monday formally appointed a transition council charged with ensuring that long-awaited general elections are held in a country with no democratically elected institutions.

            While many doubt the creation of the council will help the government hold elections this year as envisioned, Prime Minister Ariel Henry said it was a significant step toward that goal.

            “It is the beginning of the end of the dysfunction of our democratic institutions,” he said.











            Haiti has failed to hold elections since the July 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moïse. Henry assumed power shortly after Moïse's death, and promised that his administration would do so.

            In early January, the terms of the remaining 10 senators expired, leaving no elected officials in place for a country of more than 11 million people.

            Henry called on all Haitians to unite and fight for change as the country continues to spiral, with poverty and hunger deepening and violence spiking. The prime minister also thanked the council’s three members for agreeing to join the government in the “noble and thankless task of serving our country in these difficult times.”

            The council’s three members are Calixte Fleuridor with Haiti’s Protestant Federation, who will represent civil society; Mirlande Manigat, a law professor and former first lady and presidential candidate who will represent political parties; and Laurent Saint-Cyr, president of the Haitian Chamber of Commerce, who will represent the private sector.

            The council also will be responsible for working with government officials to reform Haiti’s constitution, implement economic reforms and reduce violence as gangs continue to grow more powerful since the presidential assassination, leading to a rise in killings, kidnappings and rapes.

            The High Transition Council, as it’s known, also will choose the members of a provisional electoral council that needs to be in place before election planning begins.

            Henry stressed that elections can't be held until Haiti becomes safer: “It would not be acceptable for the state to ask politicians to campaign if the state cannot guarantee their security,” he said. 

            He noted that the new council also supports his call for the deployment of foreign troops to help quell violence in Haiti, a request he made in October that remains unheeded by the U.N.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802272,SC Republicans to appeal redistricting case to Supreme Court,"COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — A federal appeals court has denied South Carolina Republicans' motion for a stay in the ongoing challenge over the state's congressional district map.

            Leading GOP lawmakers will now take their case to the U.S. Supreme Court in attempt to avoid redrawing the map that a three-judge federal panel last month deemed unconstitutional as a discriminatory racial gerrymander.

            The judges ruled in early January that the boundaries passed last year by the Republican-dominated state Legislature marked an intentional splitting of Black voters in South Carolina's 1st District, which runs from Charleston to Hilton Head Island.











            The Feb. 4 order postponed the date by which new maps may be presented. If the Supreme Court takes the case and affirms the federal panel's ruling, the state's coastal 1st District will not be redrawn until 30 days after the high court's final decision. The panel had previously ordered lawmakers to submit new maps by the end of March.

            Political control over the seat has seesawed in recent elections. In 2018, Joe Cunningham became the first South Carolina Democrat to flip a U.S. House seat in 30 years. But Republican Nancy Mace beat Cunningham by just over 1 percentage point in the following cycle, and won reelection this past November by 14 percentage points under the new district lines.

            After the new congressional maps were approved, civil rights groups swiftly filed a lawsuit charging the state Legislature with choosing “perhaps the worst option of the available maps” for Black voters.

            The Jan. 6 ruling found that map drawers violated federal law by using race to achieve the partisan goal of making the 1st District safer for Republicans. The judges wrote that GOP legislative leaders pulled Black voters out of the 1st District and packed them into the 6th District — where Rep. Jim Clyburn, the only Democrat currently in the state's congressional delegation, has served for 30 years.

            In a Jan. 27 motion for a stay, lawyers for the state House, Senate and State Election Commission argued that the decision failed “to disentangle race from politics.” The lawyers wrote the civil rights groups failed to prove race was the “predominant consideration” for the map makers. Instead, the lawyers reiterated, the GOP-led General Assembly passed maps that sought to maintain the state's 6-1 split of Republicans to Democrats and protect incumbents.

            “(T)he Enacted Plan limits the ability of all Democrats — African American and white — to form a winning political coalition in District 1,"" the lawyers wrote.

            During the eight-day trial in late November 2022, civil rights' groups lawyers presented testimony from experts whose data showed the maps were racially discriminatory. In a Feb. 3 filing opposing the motion to stay, the lawyers argued that the maps still treated Black voters differently than white voters of the same political party.

            Because the panel found that African Americans' fundamental voting rights had been violated, the judges said they would not grant a stay — which would have lifted their ban on any new elections before a new map had been adopted.

            “The Court has every hope and expectation that the appeal process can be completed and a remedial plan adopted before the 2024 primary and general elections,” the judges wrote. ""However, on the outside chance the process is not completed in time for the 2024 primary and general election schedule, the election for Congressional District No. 1 should not be conducted until a remedial plan is in place.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802273,Hawaii firefighter dies after being swept into storm drain,"WAILUKU, Hawaii (AP) — A firefighter who was swept into a storm drain while responding to a storm on the Hawaiian island of Maui died over the weekend, officials said. 

            Treʻ Evans-Dumaran, 24, died Saturday, according to a Maui County news release. He was in critical condition in the intensive care unit at Maui Memorial Medical Center after he was swept into a storm drain during heavy rain in Wailuku on Jan. 27. He was carried the length of eight football fields until he was found where the drain ended near the shoreline. 

            A week ago, county officials said Evans-Dumaran, who was with the Maui Fire Department for three years, was “slowing making positive and promising signs of progress.” 











            But his family confirmed he died Saturday morning, the county said. 

            The county released a statement from his mother, Chelsie Evans, thanking the community for an “outpouring of love.” 

            As of Monday, a GoFundMe page for the firefighter raised more than $136,000. 

            “My heart tells me that Tre’ wants to say thank you for loving his family, his fire ’ohana, his friends during this time,” his mother's statement said, using the Hawaiian word for family. “He’d want people to keep giving blood, to keep doing your part as a hero, in the way he lived every day on Earth.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802274,White House: Improved surveillance caught Chinese balloon,"WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. officials said Monday that improvements ordered by President Joe Biden to strengthen defenses against Chinese espionage helped to identify last week’s spy balloon — and to determine that similar flights were conducted at multiple points during the Trump administration.

            White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said that after Biden took office, the U.S. “enhanced our surveillance of our territorial airspace, we enhanced our capacity to be able to detect things that the Trump administration was unable to detect.” 

            Biden, in turn, has been faulted by some Republicans for not ordering the balloon shot down before it made its way across the U.S. Officials have said there was concern about damage to people on the ground, and Biden addressed the issue on Monday.











            “Once it came over to the United States, from Canada, I told the Defense Department I wanted to shoot it down as soon as it was appropriate,” Biden said. The military concluded ""we should not shoot it down over land, it was not a serious threat.”

            In a brief exchange with reporters, Biden expressed his continued displeasure with Beijing. Asked why China launched the balloon over the U.S., he replied simply, “Because they’re the Chinese.”

            Biden administration officials have planned a classified briefing for all senators on Thursday to discuss the spy balloon situation, according to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer's office.

            Sullivan, speaking at an event hosted by the U.S. Global Leadership Coalition, said as part of the surveillance improvements since Biden took office, “we were able to go back and look at the historical patterns"" and uncover ""multiple instances” during the Trump administration in which Chinese surveillance balloons traversed American airspace and territory.

            Several Trump administration officials have have said they didn't learn of Chinese spy balloons during their tenures. 

            Before Monday, U.S. officials had said that at least three times during the Trump administration and at least one other time during Biden’s time as president balloons have crossed American airspace, but not for this long. In those instances, the United States determined the balloons belonged to China only after they had left U.S. airspace, said Gen. Glen VanHerck, head of U.S. Northern Command. 

            “I will tell you that we did not detect those threats,” VanHerck said of his military command. “And that’s a domain awareness gap that we have to figure out.” He added that the U.S. intelligence community “after the fact” informed his command about the balloons.

            Sullivan did not explain what specifically allowed the U.S. to detect and track the latest balloon where the previous administration might not have. Officials have said, without elaborating, that China has flown similar balloons over parts of five continents in recent years.

            Sullivan defended Biden's decision to wait until the balloon was off the Carolina coastline before shooting it down, saying military advisers assessed that downing it over water “created a greater possibility that we could effectively exploit the wreckage than if it were shot down over land.” That was in addition to the warnings from the Pentagon of a potential risk to Americans on the ground.

            VanHerck described the debris spreading on the waters over “15 football fields by 15 football fields square.”

            “The payload itself, I would categorize that as a jet airliner type of size, maybe a regional jet. ... Probably weighed in excess of a couple thousand pounds,” he said.

            Sullivan said the U.S. was ""still piecing through” which Chinese officials knew what about the balloon and would not speak publicly yet about U.S. assessments about China's intentions flying it over the U.S.

            The Biden administration had previously raised concerns about China's use of surveillance balloons with Congress, including during briefings last August, according to White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre.

            White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters on Monday that the U.S. military had begun collecting debris from the balloon. He also confirmed that the White House has offered to brief key officials from the Trump administration, but said briefings had yet to take place.

            Kirby firmly rejected Beijing's claim that the U.S. violated international law by shooting down the balloon.

            “The United States, under President Biden’s authority and orders acted in accordance with international law and in defense of our homeland and our sovereign airspace,” Kirby said. ""We were absolutely within our rights to bring down that balloon.”

            Kirby also dismissed China’s contention that the balloon was for meteorological purposes, saying “it strains credulity ... that this was some kind of weather balloon that was floating on the winds.”

            VanHerck, commander of U.S. Northern Command, said the U.S. “took maximum precautions” to prevent the balloon from collecting information as it crossed the nation. He declined to provide any details on how that was done, including by the military’s U.S. Strategic Command. The Navy is taking protective measures during recovery operations, in case there were explosives on the balloon, he said.

            He said some debris may float ashore, and he warned the public not to try to collect it. 

            The decision to strike the balloon when it was six miles off the coast was made after consultations with NASA, which had estimated the potential debris field due to the balloon’s altitude, VanHerck said.

            The Navy is also using an underwater unmanned vehicle to photograph and track debris. Monday was the first day it could be used due to rough seas, according to White House and Pentagon officials.

            The White House said the balloon was a setback to already tense relations with Beijing. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was supposed to visit China but the trip was put on hold because of the incident. 

            Still, White House officials said America's China relationship is perhaps the most consequential for the United States and that communication between the two countries continues. Jean-Pierre said the incident hasn't changed Biden's focus on establishing guardrails in the often tense relationship and acting cooperatively on some issues of mutual concern.

            Associated Press writers Tara Copp and Colleen Long contributed reportingWASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. officials said Monday that improvements ordered by President Joe Biden to strengthen defenses against Chinese espionage helped to identify last week’s spy balloon — and to determine that similar flights were conducted at multiple points during the Trump administration.White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said that after Biden took office, the U.S. “enhanced our surveillance of our territorial airspace, we enhanced our capacity to be able to detect things that the Trump administration was unable to detect.”Biden, in turn, has been faulted by some Republicans for not ordering the balloon shot down before it made its way across the U.S. Officials have said there was concern about damage to people on the ground, and Biden addressed the issue on Monday.“Once it came over to the United States, from Canada, I told the Defense Department I wanted to shoot it down as soon as it was appropriate,” Biden said. The military concluded ""we should not shoot it down over land, it was not a serious threat.”In a brief exchange with reporters, Biden expressed his continued displeasure with Beijing. Asked why China launched the balloon over the U.S., he replied simply, “Because they’re the Chinese.”Biden administration officials have planned a classified briefing for all senators on Thursday to discuss the spy balloon situation, according to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer's office.Sullivan, speaking at an event hosted by the U.S. Global Leadership Coalition, said as part of the surveillance improvements since Biden took office, “we were able to go back and look at the historical patterns"" and uncover ""multiple instances” during the Trump administration in which Chinese surveillance balloons traversed American airspace and territory.Several Trump administration officials have have said they didn't learn of Chinese spy balloons during their tenures.Before Monday, U.S. officials had said that at least three times during the Trump administration and at least one other time during Biden’s time as president balloons have crossed American airspace, but not for this long. In those instances, the United States determined the balloons belonged to China only after they had left U.S. airspace, said Gen. Glen VanHerck, head of U.S. Northern Command.“I will tell you that we did not detect those threats,” VanHerck said of his military command. “And that’s a domain awareness gap that we have to figure out.” He added that the U.S. intelligence community “after the fact” informed his command about the balloons.Sullivan did not explain what specifically allowed the U.S. to detect and track the latest balloon where the previous administration might not have. Officials have said, without elaborating, that China has flown similar balloons over parts of five continents in recent years.Sullivan defended Biden's decision to wait until the balloon was off the Carolina coastline before shooting it down, saying military advisers assessed that downing it over water “created a greater possibility that we could effectively exploit the wreckage than if it were shot down over land.” That was in addition to the warnings from the Pentagon of a potential risk to Americans on the ground.VanHerck described the debris spreading on the waters over “15 football fields by 15 football fields square.”“The payload itself, I would categorize that as a jet airliner type of size, maybe a regional jet. ... Probably weighed in excess of a couple thousand pounds,” he said.Sullivan said the U.S. was ""still piecing through” which Chinese officials knew what about the balloon and would not speak publicly yet about U.S. assessments about China's intentions flying it over the U.S.The Biden administration had previously raised concerns about China's use of surveillance balloons with Congress, including during briefings last August, according to White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre.White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters on Monday that the U.S. military had begun collecting debris from the balloon. He also confirmed that the White House has offered to brief key officials from the Trump administration, but said briefings had yet to take place.Kirby firmly rejected Beijing's claim that the U.S. violated international law by shooting down the balloon.“The United States, under President Biden’s authority and orders acted in accordance with international law and in defense of our homeland and our sovereign airspace,” Kirby said. ""We were absolutely within our rights to bring down that balloon.”Kirby also dismissed China’s contention that the balloon was for meteorological purposes, saying “it strains credulity ... that this was some kind of weather balloon that was floating on the winds.”VanHerck, commander of U.S. Northern Command, said the U.S. “took maximum precautions” to prevent the balloon from collecting information as it crossed the nation. He declined to provide any details on how that was done, including by the military’s U.S. Strategic Command. The Navy is taking protective measures during recovery operations, in case there were explosives on the balloon, he said.He said some debris may float ashore, and he warned the public not to try to collect it.The decision to strike the balloon when it was six miles off the coast was made after consultations with NASA, which had estimated the potential debris field due to the balloon’s altitude, VanHerck said.The Navy is also using an underwater unmanned vehicle to photograph and track debris. Monday was the first day it could be used due to rough seas, according to White House and Pentagon officials.The White House said the balloon was a setback to already tense relations with Beijing. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was supposed to visit China but the trip was put on hold because of the incident.Still, White House officials said America's China relationship is perhaps the most consequential for the United States and that communication between the two countries continues. Jean-Pierre said the incident hasn't changed Biden's focus on establishing guardrails in the often tense relationship and acting cooperatively on some issues of mutual concern.“It’s up to China to figure out what kind of relationship that they want,” she said.___Associated Press writers Tara Copp and Colleen Long contributed reporting",2023/2/7,,World

            Saakashvili, who served as Georgia's president in 2004-13 and led the so-called Rose Revolution protests that drove the previous president out of office, left for Ukraine after the end of his second term.

            He went on hunger strikes after his arrest and is currently in a private clinic. His supporters say he should be released for medical examination outside Georgia because of concerns that he is suffering from poisoning by heavy metals.

            His neck in a brace, the barefoot man was carried on a stretcher as he emerged. Rescuers in Pazarcik in the province of Kahramanmaras held him aloft and ran off with him.

            It was among numerous rescue efforts that unfolded as darkness, rain and cold enveloped the region of Turkey and Syria that was rocked by a powerful 7.8 magnitude earthquake. Hours later, a 7.5 magnitude temblor struck more than 100 kilometers (60 miles) away. At least 3,400 people were killed, and civilians joined rescuers in desperate efforts across Turkey and Syria. 











            “Can anyone hear me?” rescuers shouted. In some places around southeast Turkey, survivors could be heard screaming from beneath collapsed buildings.

            People crouched to look below a massive sheet of concrete propped at an angle by steel bars. They crawled in and out, trying to reach survivors. Excavating equipment dug through the rubble below.

            Elsewhere in Kahramanmaras province, rescuers pulled two children alive from the rubble. One lay on a stretcher on the snowy ground. Rescuers quieted the throngs of people trying to help so they could hear survivors and find them.

            Some emerged safely then waited to hear any word on relatives. 

            “My two grandchildren, my daughter-in-law, are all inside. They haven’t come out,” said Hasan Birbalta while waiting near a collapsed building in Pazarcik, adding the granddaughter is 2 and the grandson is 6. 

            Thousands of search-and-rescue personnel, firefighters and medics were working across 10 provinces, along with some 3,500 soldiers. Residents lifted rubble and unearthed people heard screaming from beneath buildings. Aftershocks made rescue efforts more dangerous. 

            In Adana, about 20 people, some in emergency rescue jackets, used power saws atop the concrete mountain of a collapsed building to carve out space that would let any survivors climb out or be rescued. Later, excavators joined the efforts as bright spotlights illuminated the wreckage. 

            Turkish military ambulance planes were transporting the injured to Istanbul and Ankara hospitals, the defense ministry said. Rescuers from across Turkey tried to make it to the provinces amid heavy snow and rain. 

            At a news conference late Monday, four ministers said that because Hatay’s airport had been severely damaged, they had to fly into Adana nearly three hours away.

            In Syria, a man held a dead girl in his arms beside a two-story collapsed concrete building as he walked away from the debris. He and a woman set the girl on the floor under covering to protect her from the rain, wrapping her in a large blanket and looking back to the building, overwhelmed. 

            An official with Turkey’s disaster management authority said 7,840 people had been rescued across 10 provinces. The official, Orhan Tatar, said 5,606 buildings had collapsed. 

            Tatar said the total area affected was large and places were hard to reach, but that as of late Monday, teams had been directed to all collapsed buildings.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802282,"LeBron's Miami era, as told by teammate Shane Battier","(Editor's Note: Shane Battier is a former Miami Heat teammate of LeBron James, who is poised to become the NBA's all-time leading scorer. Battier played in the NBA for 13 seasons, the last three of them with James in Miami. He shared some memorable moments with The Associated Press of what he witnessed during their time together with the Heat.)

            There was a night that I’ll never forget as long as I live, and it made me have just such a deeper appreciation for who LeBron James was as a person, as a man, as a player.

            We were in Boston in 2012, during the playoffs, no love lost from Boston fans. We’re walking to dinner and a car slows down next to us. A guy said, “Hey LeBron, I hate you, you suck.” He rolls up the window and proceeds down the street.











            As players we’re used to being called names and whatnot. But at that moment I understood all the stuff he had to deal with from Day 1 and being on the cover of Sports Illustrated at 16 and being No. 1 in the draft and being the most hyped athlete maybe ever, the most famous athlete maybe ever at every step of the way. There wasn’t a moment where he could hide behind a teammate, hide behind a coach.

            He’s always proven he can handle it. He handled it that time, too.

            The next night was Game 6 of the Eastern Conference finals. We all know what Game 6 was for us, right? If we lose Game 6, then we all have new addresses the next year. The Big Three is a Dumpster fire of an experiment that failed at the highest level. And legacies were on the line, from LeBron to Pat Riley to Erik Spoelstra, you name it. We knew what the implications of losing that Game 6 would be. (Editor’s Note: Miami trailed the Celtics, 3-2 and James had 45 points, 15 rebounds and five assists in Game 6 to save the season, one where the Heat went on to win the NBA title.) 

            I played baseball growing up. The way he played that night was the closest thing to watching a no-hitter, a perfect game. We sort of nudged, sort of elbowed each other on the bench and said, “Oh my gosh, this guy’s a monster.” We didn’t want to talk about it. We tried to be cool. But, I’m sorry, we’d never seen anything like this. And we’ve all seen everything in the game. You want to look up determination in the dictionary? It’d be LeBron James. It was the greatest display of will that I saw in my entire career because of the circumstances, because of the consequences, because of the team we played. The Celtics had no shot that night. I had never seen anything like it, even to this day.

            In my mind, he’s the greatest player of all time. I’m biased, I know that, but I’m allowed to be. And I know we said this with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, we said this with Wilt Chamberlain, we said this with Michael Jordan, but I don’t think we’ll see someone like LeBron James ever again.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802283,"LeBron's Los Angeles era, as told by coach Darvin Ham","(Editors' Note: Darvin Ham is in his first season as coach of the Los Angeles Lakers. He was a longtime NBA assistant coach and as a player helped the Detroit Pistons win the NBA title in 2004.)

            When I got hired to coach the Los Angeles Lakers, one of the first things that I saw was the tweet where LeBron James congratulated me.

            I’m not on social media myself, but people I know who are, and they saw it and screen-shotted it and sent it to me. All the major platforms were showing the tweet, so I got his number and called him and just had a lot of laughs.











            That’s when I started to learn what he’s all about. There was a lot of excitement on that call. There was energy both ways. We were ready to get started, ready to get going. He was verbalizing it, that I have his full support and that we were going to figure this thing out, to right the ship, so to speak. He said we’re going to get back to the way we should be performing and what we’re representing in terms of the Lakers. And he’s lived up to that every step of the way.

            I waited a long time for a job like this. And working with LeBron, it’s an interactive type of relationship. He has a willingness to be coached. I’ll just start there. That’s the most awesome thing about 'Bron. He allows himself to be coached. You can get on him in a film session. You can point out mistakes. He’ll either admit it — “my bad” — or if he disagrees, he’ll disagree. And we figure it out. But it’s never anything malicious. It’s never anything personal. It’s not about his way or my way. We’re trying to figure out the best way.

            That’s who he is. Everything has to be the best way. He’s one of one. His size, his athleticism, his shooting capabilities, his playmaking capabilities ... we haven’t seen anything like him before.

            I don’t think he’s ever wanted the scoring record. He’s about team. He wants the team to do well. That’s the thing that shines through. He’s everything that he’s been advertised to be and much more. But just being around him and seeing him, I know he really enjoys his teammates. I’d even go as far as to say all this attention embarrasses him a little. When everybody’s trying to shine a light on him individually, he handles it with grace, don’t get me wrong, but he would much rather be a part of a group celebration than everyone talking about how great he is.

            And we all know he’s great. Arguably the greatest. But he would prefer that everything be group focused. He’s about “How can my team and my teammates be put in the best position to be successful, not just me?” It’s a beautiful thing to see. It’s a beautiful thing to live every day and witness firsthand.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802285,Lazio held at Serie A struggler Verona to 1-1,"MILAN (AP) — Lazio was held at relegation-threatened Hellas Verona to 1-1 on Monday to hamper its hopes of consolidating its place in the top four in Serie A in a tight race for the Champions League spots.

            Cyril Ngonge scored his first goal for Verona on his first start after joining last month, to cancel out Pedro’s opener.

            Lazio inched a point above Atalanta and AC Milan, which both lost at the weekend. It was a point behind Roma and four behind second-placed Inter Milan.











            Verona moved to within four points of safety. 

            Lazio was hoping to move into third place in Serie A.

            It broke the deadlock in stunning fashion on the stroke of halftime. Pedro played a one-two with Danilo Cataldi, gathered with his back to goal and swivelled to curl a magnificent shot into the top left corner.

            Verona leveled six minutes after the break when Darko Lazović whipped in a free kick for Ngonge to head in at the near post.

            After setting up the equalizer, Lazović almost turned it around completely two minutes later but his fierce effort came off the right post.

            LAST KICK

            Monza used the last kick of the match — a penalty — to snatch a 2-2 draw at home to Sampdoria.

            Samp thought it was heading for its first win since the start of the the year after Manolo Gabbiadini netted in each half.

            But deep in stoppage time, Nicola Murru hauled down Andrea Petagna and Matteo Pessina converted the resulting spot kick nine minutes into added time.

            Petagna scored the first equaliser for Monza in the 32nd.

            Samp was second from last in the standings, eight points from safety. It had lost its previous five matches without scoring a goal.

            The Twins announced Monday that Correa will not participate with the Puerto Rico national team for the fifth edition of the event, which was last played in 2017. Correa's wife, Daniella, is due with the couple's second child on March 11. The WBC begins on March 8.

            “This was a challenging decision for Carlos. He takes so much pride in representing his country and truly considered ways to make this work,"" Twins president of baseball operations Derek Falvey said. “We all acknowledged that the back and forth flying combined with multiple days off from baseball activity didn't set Carlos up for jumping into meaningful games upon his return.”











            Twins position players are scheduled to report for spring training by Feb. 19. Correa signed a six-year, $200 million contract with the club on Jan. 11. The deal is structured with the potential to pay Correa as much as $270 million over 10 seasons if he stays healthy.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802287,Former Chelsea forward Atsu missing after Turkey earthquake,"Former Chelsea and Newcastle forward Christian Atsu is missing and believed to be trapped under rubble following the powerful earthquake that struck Turkey  on Monday and left more than 2,500 people dead.

            The Ghana international, who plays for Turkish club Hatayspor, is thought to be in a building that was destroyed, Hatayspor spokesman Mustafa Özat said, according to Turkish media.

            Özat said club director Taner Savut was also believed to be in a building that collapsed and club officials couldn't contact both men. They were likely trapped, Özat said.











            At least two other Hatayspor players had to be pulled out of rubble but were now safe, Özat said. Atsu and Savut were the only two Hatayspor players or officials still unaccounted for, he added.

            The 31-year-old Atsu joined Hatayspor, which is based in the southern city of Antakya, last year after a spell playing in Saudi Arabia.

            The 7.8 magnitude earthquake rocked large parts of Turkey and neighboring Syria in the pre-dawn hours of Monday.

            The quake was centered in Turkey’s southeastern province of Kahramanmaras, and was felt as far away as Cairo in Egypt. Hours later, a second 7.5 magnitude jolt, which was possibly an aftershock, struck more than 100 kilometers (60 miles) away from the epicenter of the earthquake and caused more destruction.

            Turkish authorities said more than 3,700 buildings were destroyed. The death toll is expected to rise.

            Ghana President Nana Akufo-Addo offered condolences to the people of Turkey on his official Facebook account and added: “We pray that our fellow Ghanaian, Christian Atsu, is found safe and sound.""

            Ghana Football Association spokesman Henry Asante-Twum wrote in an email to The Associated Press that they had no news of Atsu and Ghana's international relations department was seeking information from Turkish authorities.

            Ibrahim Kwarteng, a friend of Atsu, said he had tried calling Atsu but couldn't reach him.

            “We are only praying that he will be found,"" Kwarteng said.

            Kwarteng runs a foundation in Ghana that helps former prisoners convicted of petty crimes to be reintegrated into society after their release from jail. He said Atsu was the single largest donor to the foundation.

            Newcastle said on its official Twitter account it was “praying for some positive news” regarding Atsu.

            The 2009 AL Cy Young Award winner rejoined the Royals last year for the first time since 2010 and went 4-9 with a 3.68 ERA in 26 starts and 137 innings. He had a $13 million salary last year and then became a free agent. His deal announced Friday includes an $8.5 million salary for this year.

            If he pitches 135 innings, he would earn at least $13 million.











            Greinke has $7.5 million in performance bonuses for innings. He would get $450,000 for 90 innings and each additional five innings through 135. He would get $300,000 for 140 innings and each additional five innings through 185.

            The 39-year-old right-hander gets a full no-trade provision. He would get $100,000 for winning another Cy Young Award or winning an MVP award and he would get $50,000 for finishing second through fifth in the voting for either honor.

            He would get $100,000 for World Series MVP and $50,000 each for League Championship Series MVP, a Gold Glove award or All-Star Game election or selection.

            A six-time All-Star, Greinke allowed two runs or fewer in 17 of 26 starts last year.

            He began his career in Kansas City as a first-round pick in the 2002 amateur draft. He made his big league debut two years later, beginning a 20-year career that has included time with the Brewers, Angels, Dodgers, Diamondbacks and Astros.

            Greinke was later traded to Milwaukee in December 2010 for a package of players that helped to form the backbone of back-to-back American League pennant teams and the club that won the 2015 World Series.

            Greinke twice helped the Astros to the World Series, pitched for the Brewers and Dodgers in the NL Championship Series and led the Diamondbacks to the playoffs.

            He is first among active pitchers with 514 starts and 3,247 innings, and he’s second to Justin Verlander with 223 wins. Greinke is third in strikeouts (2,882) and has six Gold Gloves.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802289,Brady will not move into Fox announcing booth until 2024,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Tom Brady will not go immediately from the playing field to the broadcast booth.

            Brady told Colin Cowherd during Monday's episode of “The Herd” on FS1 and Fox Sports Radio that he will not start his broadcasting career with Fox until the 2024 season. 

            The seven-time Super Bowl champion — who retired last week after a 23-year career with the New England Patriots and Tampa Bay Buccaneers — signed a 10-year deal with Fox last May to become the network's top analyst when he decided to quit playing for good.











            Brady said that he didn't want to immediately rush into announcing and that he wanted to catch up on some other parts of his life.

            “I think one thing about my career whether it was when I was drafted by the Patriots or signing agreements with the Bucs, I wanted to be fully committed and I never wanted to let people down,” Brady said. “I want to be great at what I do, and that always takes some time and strategizing and learning and growing and evolving. I have so many people to rely on that could support me in that growth too.”

            Brady is expected to eventually join Kevin Burkhardt on Fox's top team. Burkhardt and Greg Olsen will call their first Super Bowl on Sunday when the Kansas City Chiefs face the Philadelphia Eagles.

            Fox, which is carrying its 10th Super Bowl on Sunday, also has Super Bowl 59 in New Orleans after the 2024 season. Brady is still not expected to be a part of Fox's pregame coverage on Sunday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802290,Spanish prosecutors oppose attempt to free Alves on bail,"BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — Spanish prosecutors oppose the appeal by Dani Alves' defense team for him to be free on bail while the investigation continues into sexual assault accusations against the footballer.

            Alves' lawyers filed the appeal last week saying the Brazilian agreed to turn in his passport and wear a tracking device if he was freed. Alves would also report to the court and to authorities as often as required, including daily, and would not go within 500 meters (yards) of the accuser or her home or workplace. 

            Prosecutors said on Monday that Alves remained a flight risk if he was set free.











            Alves was provisionally detained in January after being accused of sexually assaulting a woman at a nightclub on Dec. 30. He's denied wrongdoing.

            A judge ordered the veteran player to be jailed without bail after analyzing the initial probe by authorities and hearing testimony from Alves, the alleged victim, and a witness.

            The judge took testimony from eight witnesses at a closed hearing in Barcelona last week. She will decide whether the case should go to trial.

            Prosecutors said on Monday they also opposed the request made by some local nightclub associations to be part of those accusing Alves.

            The 39-year-old Alves has won 42 soccer titles, including three Champions Leagues with Barcelona and two Copa Americas with Brazil. He played in his third World Cup last year in Qatar.

Love reflected on his time with James for The Associated Press.)

            Those years LeBron had here in Cleveland, capped by a winning a championship, cemented his legacy. Naturally, the first one he got in Miami was a weight off his shoulders. The back-to-back titles solidified him and the Heat. It showed they were a dynasty before we saw those guys out in San Francisco, that’s a real powerful team. I feel that, and I think he would say the same, that 2016, especially in the manner that we won, and against the 73-9 team we beat and him being from Akron, it was definitely the most important one for him.

            What always impressed me about my time with LeBron is the precision of his life. He’s a man with a plan. He’s become larger than the game.











            It will be very tough to eclipse or surpass him as a better face for the NBA and what he has meant for the league.

And when you consider what he’s done away from basketball with the I Promise School or the people he has impacted over the course of his career or what he’ll do after basketball, it's a pretty incredible story about who he is and what he’s about.

Everybody that he touches, especially if you have that opportunity to be within his orbit or his gravitational pull, whether it’s covering him as a media member or me playing with him in very special years, especially here and because of what he means to Northeast Ohio, that is definitely something that is not lost on me.

            For when it happened at the point it did in my life, it could not have been better for me. It really helped me grow up and become a man and understand sacrifice and become a better teammate while also allowing me to be my authentic self and unapologetically myself, 100%.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802305,Nationals avoid arbitration with outfielder Victor Robles,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Washington Nationals avoided arbitration with outfielder Victor Robles, agreeing Monday to a one-year contract worth $2,325,000 as part of a deal that includes a club option for 2024.

            Robles would make $3.3 million in 2024 if the option is exercised. There is no buyout.

            Robles is one of only a few players left from Washington’s 2019 World Series championship team and the only position player left from the team's starting lineup during that run. 











            A strong defensive centerfielder who turns 26 in May, Robles hit .224 with six home runs, 33 RBIs and 15 stolen bases in 128 games last season. Those are his highest totals since the World Series year.

            In 1,675 plate appearances over 480 regular-season games, all with the Nationals, Robles is hitting .224 with a .306 on-base percentage. 

            Robles earned $1.65 million last year. He had asked for $2.6 million and had been offered $2.3 million when the sides exchanged proposed arbitration salaries on Jan. 13.

            He is eligible for free agency after the 2024 season.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802313,Alex Murdaugh murder jury to hear financial crimes evidence,"A judge ruled Monday he will allow jurors to hear evidence that disgraced South Carolina attorney Alex Murdaugh was stealing money from his law firm and clients and committing other financial crimes long before his wife and son were killed in 2021.

            Prosecutors have said those witnesses are key to their case in Murdaugh's double murder trial to show he was worried his alleged crimes were about to be discovered and that Murdaugh killed his family to get sympathy and buy time to cover up the missing money.

            Murdaugh, 54, is standing trial in the shootings of his 52-year-old wife, Maggie, and 22-year-old son, Paul, on June 7, 2021, at their Colleton County home. He faces 30 years to life in prison if convicted of murder.











            The defense argued that prosecutors want to smear Alex Murdaugh with details of his finances because they have lots of evidence he stole money but none on the killings. Murdaugh's lawyers said it is ridiculous that a lawyer would think scrutiny into his life would be diminished by the brutal deaths of his family.

            In explaining his ruling, Judge Clifton Newman said the jury is entitled to consider whether Murdaugh's “apparent desperation” and “dire financial situation” resulted in the killings of his family.

            Newman said he didn't think the financial crime evidence alone would persuade the jury to convict Murdaugh of murder.

            The decision means jurors over the next several days will hear from witnesses who testified previously before a judge about how Murdaugh secured $4 million in settlements for the family of the longtime Murdaugh housekeeper who died in a fall. He allegedly kept the money for himself.

            Other testimony includes the office manager confronting Murdaugh over almost $800,000 in missing law firm fees the day of the killings and how a key hearing in a wrongful death lawsuit that might reveal the true condition of Murdaugh's finances was scheduled for three days after his wife and son were shot. The hearing was cancelled.

            Early Monday afternoon, the woman taking care of Alex Murdaugh's mother testified about how he stopped by to visit her the night of the killings. Murdaugh said he found the bodies after seeing his mother, who has dementia.

            Shelley Smith testified Monday that was the first time she saw Murdaugh visit his mother during her 8 p.m. at 8 a.m. shift, although during cross-examination the defense brought up a statement Smith previously made to a state agent in which she said Murdaugh has visited late at night before and was the most frequent visitor among his siblings.

            
                Alex Murdaugh stayed about 20 minutes or so, laying beside his mother and holding her hand, Smith said. She didn't notice any blood on him.

            Smith also testified that Alex Murdaugh visited nine days after the killings at 6:30 a.m. and was carrying a blue tarp. In their opening statement, prosecutors mentioned a blue rain coat with gunshot residue on it. Defense attorney Jim Griffin spent several minutes getting Smith to say the item was big, like a tarp, not a raincoat.

            The defense then asked Judge Newman to prevent any other witnesses from testifying about the raincoat, but Newman initially refused. A state agent testified Monday afternoon that a blue poncho was found in Murdaugh's mother's home by agents looking for a blue tarp three months after the killings.

            Before a state agent could testify about whether anything was found on the garment, the defense asked again for the judge to prevent the witness from testifying further. Newman adjourned court without a ruling.

            “They have no evidence connecting Mr. Murdaugh to that rain jacket,” Griffin said.

            Newman's decision to allow evidence of Alex Murdaugh's possible financial crimes came after hearing from a potential witness Monday — a lawyer representing a family suing Murdaugh over a boat crash killed 19-year-old Mallory Beach in 2019. Alex's son Paul Murdaugh was driving the boat and faced a felony charge of boating under the influence at the time of his death.

            When Alex Murdaugh called 911 and first spoke to investigators after his wife and son were killed, he mentioned people who knew Beach being angry with his son.

            Beach family attorney Mark Tinsley said Alex Murdaugh and his lawyer were working hard to keep his financial information out of Tinsley's hands when the killings happened. 

            “Pretty quickly I recognized, the case against Alex, if he was the victim of some vigilante, would in fact be over,” Tinsley said.

            He said Murdaugh's lawyer told him Alex Murdaugh was broke, but Tinsley didn't believe it given what appeared to be a successful law practice and his family's generational wealth. He said justice called for damages from Murdaugh because they could not bring Beach back.

            “The Beach family stood on the causeway for eight days while their daughter's body was in the water,” Tinsley said. ""I don’t know there is any amount of money somebody would willingly take to go through what they went through.”A judge ruled Monday he will allow jurors to hear evidence that disgraced South Carolina attorney Alex Murdaugh was stealing money from his law firm and clients and committing other financial crimes long before his wife and son were killed in 2021.Prosecutors have said those witnesses are key to their case in Murdaugh's double murder trial to show he was worried his alleged crimes were about to be discovered and that Murdaugh killed his family to get sympathy and buy time to cover up the missing money.Murdaugh, 54, is standing trial in the shootings of his 52-year-old wife, Maggie, and 22-year-old son, Paul, on June 7, 2021, at their Colleton County home.

            Family members were also on board when the plane landed at the airport in the city where he will be buried Tuesday. Musharraf, who died at age 79, seized power in a bloodless coup in 1999 by ousting the elected government of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif. 

            Musharraf died in Dubai on Sunday after a prolonged illness.











            During his tenure as president, Musharraf made Pakistan a key ally of Washington in the war on terror after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks in the United States. That angered militants who at least twice tried to assassinate him in the city of Rawalpindi in 2003, but he escaped unhurt.

            Musharraf was forced to resign in 2008 by the party of former president Asif Ali Zardari when his allies lost parliamentary elections. Pakistan later allowed him to leave the country on bail to travel to Dubai in 2016 for medical treatment. He remained there after being sentenced to death for treason.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802323,MATCHDAY: Ryan Reynolds-owned Wrexham plays FA Cup replay,"A look at what’s happening in European soccer on Tuesday:

            ENGLAND

            Wrexham, a Welsh team from the fifth tier of English soccer and owned by Hollywood stars Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney, looks to cause another upset in the FA Cup and set up a last-16 match against Tottenham. Wrexham visits second-tier Sheffield United in one of four fourth-round replays. The teams drew a wild match 3-3 last month at Wrexham's Racecourse Ground. Wrexham is the lowest-ranked team left in the draw and the only club from outside English soccer's top four leagues. It is gaining increasing publicity after being bought by Reynolds and McElhenney in November 2020 and being used by the celebrities in a behind-the-scenes TV series called “Welcome To Wrexham."" Among the other replays is a match between third-tier teams Fleetwood Town and Sheffield Wednesday while fourth-tier Grimsby hosts Luton, which is fourth in the second-tier Championship.











            ITALY

            Juventus travels to Salernitana in what has surprisingly become a relegation battle, with both sides perilously close to the bottom three. A 15-point penalty for false accounting and a poor run of results has left Juventus just seven points above the relegation zone. Salernitana is two points behind Juventus and can leapfrog the Bianconeri with a second successive victory after last weekend’s win at Lecce ended a run of seven matches without a win. Juventus needed a last-minute goal to salvage a 2-2 draw against Salernitana when they met in Turin in September in a match that saw three red cards in the closing stages.

            GERMANY

            Local rivals meet in the German Cup when Eintracht Frankfurt hosts second-division leader Darmstadt. Frankfurt goes into the game unbeaten in eight games in all competitions since before the World Cup. In another last-16 cup game, Freiburg visits second-division Sandhausen looking to turn its form around after recent Bundesliga setbacks. Freiburg entered 2023 in the hunt for Champions League qualification but has just four points from four games and has lost games 6-0 and 5-1.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802324,Antisemitic flyers could spur action on proposed Georgia law,"ATLANTA (AP) — A continuing wave of antisemitic flyers hit parts of suburban Atlanta, including the home of Georgia's only Jewish state legislator.

            State Rep. Esther Panitch, a freshman Democrat from Sandy Springs, denounced the flyers from the floor of the House Monday, with dozens of fellow members surrounding her to show their condemnation.

            “This weekend, it was my turn to be targeted,” Panitch said. “Unfortunately, it’s not the first time to be afraid as a Jew in the United States.” 











            
                The flyers were found in driveways in Sandy Springs and Dunwoody on Sunday, packaged in plastic baggies and weighed down with corn. Police in both cities said they are investigating.

            Similar flyers have been found recently in other Georgia communities including Acworth, Cartersville, Columbus and Kennesaw. People have also reported antisemitic flyers in other cities nationwide.

            Panitch vowed action. She's a co-sponsor of a House Bill 30, which would adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's “working definition of anti-Semitism” as Georgia law. In short, it defines it as rhetorical or physical manifestations of hatred toward Jews. This includes “targeting of the state of Israel,"" although it also says that “criticism of Israel similar to that leveled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic.” 

            Such a definition could trigger enhanced penalties for anti-Jewish criminal acts under Georgia's 2020 hate crimes law. Supporters say that too often, agencies don't react forcefully enough to antisemitic acts. 

            “We must please listen to the communities for the solutions they need,” Panitch said. “Do not dismiss them. Do not tell them it won’t matter or it’s not necessary. Hear them. We need your help. We’ve had enough. We hope you have as well.” 

            There’s no evidence that the flyers are related to the proposed law or that Panitch in particular was targeted. Some of the neighborhoods targeted are near a Jewish community center.

            The flyers brought a wave of condemnation including from Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp. The Republican said state investigators would help local police if needed.

            “This kind of hate has no place in our state and the individuals responsible do not share Georgia’s values,"" Kemp said Sunday.

            One flyer from the Goyim Defense League referenced Leo Frank, a Jewish factory manager convicted of murdering a 13-year-old girl who worked in an Atlanta pencil factory. Researchers believe Frank was wrongly convicted. Frank was kidnapped from a Georgia prison and lynched in 1915 in Marietta after a governor commuted his death sentence to life.

            Panitch said she and her family have previously encountered antisemitic acts, including swastikas drawn on her daughter's freshman dormitory room at the University of Georgia and antisemitic messages projected at last year's Georgia-Florida football game, which two of her children attended.

            ""I get angry because it doesn’t end with that. It continues with injured and murdered Jews,"" Panitch said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802333,Balloon bursts hopes for end to spiraling US-China tensions,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Monday was supposed to be a day of modest hope in the U.S.-China relationship. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was going to be in Beijing, meeting with President Xi Jinping in a high-stakes bid to ease ever-rising tensions between the world’s two largest economies.

            Instead, Blinken was spending the day in Washington after abruptly cancelling his visit late last week as the U.S. and China exchanged angry words about a suspected Chinese spy balloon the U.S. shot down. As fraught as the US-China relationship had been ahead of Blinken’s planned trip, it’s even worse now and there’s little hope for it improving anytime soon.

            Even as both sides maintain they will manage the situation in a calm manner, the mutual recriminations, particularly since the shoot-down of the balloon on Saturday that drew a stern Chinese protest, do not bode well for rapprochement. 











            The setback comes at a time when both sides were looking for a way to potentially extricate themselves from a low point in ties that has had the world on edge. 

            White House National Security Spokesman John Kirby noted Monday that Blinken's trip was delayed, not canceled. But prospects for rescheduling remain uncertain.

            “I would put this at a six” on a scale of 10, said Danny Russel, a China expert and former assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs in the Obama administration, on the damage to current diplomatic efforts between the two countries. 

            “The signals I see suggest that there has to be a pause and a line drawn under the incident but once the drama has gone through its final act, there seems to be every intention to re-engineer a trip by the secretary of state,"" said Russel, who is now vice president for international security and diplomacy at the Asia Society Policy Institute.

            The administration will be “starting at a serious deficit,” Russel said. “This is a setback but it’s not impossible to see a return. Absent mismanagement, this is recoverable.”

            Blinken and senior Chinese officials do plan to attend at least two international gatherings -- the Munich Security Conference in mid-February and a meeting of the Group of 20 foreign ministers in India in early March — that could provide venues for renewed engagement.

            But the lost opportunity caused by the balloon incident may be difficult to recreate.

            It’s not that the U.S. and China don’t talk. It’s that they talk from extremely divergent points of view with very little leeway for either to step back from entrenched positions that are often directly related to political conditions at home.

            Military-to-military channels are used, but they have been hindered by increasing Chinese incursions into Taiwanese air defense zones and aggressive actions in the South China Sea. The result is the U.S. has stepped up reconnaissance flights and warship voyages through the Taiwan Strait.

            Diplomatic channels remain open, but for several years they have been dominated by disagreements rather than grounds for potential cooperation and they are now crowded by complaints from both sides over the balloon. 

            President Joe Biden and Xi agreed to Blinken’s visit during a meeting in November in Indonesia. Biden may have been hoping that his top diplomat would return from China with a measure of progress on issues ranging from trade, Indo-Pacific security and climate change to human rights and the status of Taiwan. Instead, he now faces a domestic political maelstrom just ahead of his State of the Union speech to Congress on Tuesday. 

            Republican lawmakers have been harshly critical of what they say was Biden’s weak response to the presence of the balloon over U.S. airspace. New GOP House speaker Kevin McCarthy’s expected trip to Taiwan this year is likely to be accompanied by new complaints about the administration's approach.

            Meanwhile in Beijing, after initially taking a relatively conciliatory response to the balloon, Chinese leaders have adopted a much tougher position likely in response to nationalistic public reaction. After apologizing for the balloon, which it said was a weather craft that mistakenly strayed into U.S. airspace, China now condemns the downing as an unacceptable violation of international law and standards that has set back the potential for dialogue.

            “Blinken’s visit to China had offered a way to stabilize the U.S.–China relationship,” said Da Wei, director of the Center for International Security and Strategy at Beijing’s prestigious Tsinghua University. The postponement has now “greatly reduced"" the window for that, he said.

            Quite apart from the political implications for both, the developments have laid bare the extremely fragile nature of what many had hoped could be a manageable economic, political and military rivalry. 

            Tensions between the U.S. and China, notably over Taiwan, have been a source of deep concern for Washington and many of its allies. They worry that overt conflict will crater the global economy and their concerns were exacerbated last year with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, on which China has largely sided with the Russians.

            At the same time, China and the United States have been on a collision course on other matters, including China’s increasing aggressiveness in the South and East China Seas, which have put U.S. allies like Japan, South Korea, the Philippines and Thailand on edge, not to mention Australia and New Zealand. 

            China’s continued clampdown on pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong, its human rights record in the mainly Muslim western region of Xinjiang, harassment and imprisonment of Christians and other religious minorities elsewhere, and ongoing campaign against Tibetan leaders have all become significant irritants in ties.

            Over the last five years, China-U.S. relations have entered a new and worsening phase of confrontation, conflict and competition, said Da, calling the current period a “new kind of Cold War.” 

            “It’s very different from the Cold War between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, but if we define cold war as the two biggest countries in the world being locked in fierce confrontations and conflicts in a way that doesn’t involve military and wars ... we are rapidly moving in that direction,” Da said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802334,"Berti, Marlins settle as Thompson, Rays go to arbitration","ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) — Ryan Thompson went to arbitration with the Tampa Bay Rays on Monday, while Miami's Jon Berti reached a deal with the Marlins for $2,125,000 that avoided a hearing.

            Berti, an infielder and outfielder, gets a $2.1 million salary this year under an agreement reached before the scheduled start of Monday’s hearing. The deal includes a $3.5 million team option for 2024 with a $25,000 buyout, and the option price could escalate by $625,000 based on plate appearances this year: $125,000 each for 400, 450, 500, 525 and 550.

            Berti hit .240 with four homers, 28 RBIs and a major league-leading 41 stolen bases. He played second base, shortstop, third, left field and center. Berti had a $1.2 million base salary and earned $60,000 in performance bonuses.











            He had asked for $2.3 million and the Marlins had submitted $1.9 million when proposed arbitration salaries were exchanged on Jan. 13.

            Thompson asked for $1.2 million and the Rays argued for $1 million during a hearing before John Stout, Allen Ponak and Stephen Raymond. 

            The 30-year-old right-hander was 3-3 with a 3.80 ERA in 47 relief appearances last year, striking out 39 and walking 11 in 42 2/3 innings. He had a salary of $701,228 and was eligible for arbitration for the first time.

            Rays right-hander Jason Adam, left-hander Colin Poche and outfielder Harold Ramirez remain scheduled for hearings.

            Poche asked for $1.3 million and was offered $1,175,000 in the smallest gap among 33 players who exchanged figures with their teams on Jan. 13

            Tampa Bay had avoided hearings with three players by agreeing to multiyear deals: Left-hander Jeffrey Springs got $31 million over four years, infielder Yandy Díaz $24 million over three years and right-hander Pete Fairbanks $12 million over three years.

            Players and teams have split four decisions thus far. All-Star pitcher Max Fried ($13.5 million) lost to Atlanta and reliever Diego Castillo ($2.95 million) was defeated by Seattle, while pitcher Jesús Luzardo ($2.45 million) and AL batting champion Luis Arraez ($6.1 million) both beat the Marlins.

            A decision is pending for Los Angeles Angels outfielder Hunter Renfroe.

            Nineteen additional players are eligible for arbitration. Among them, Seattle utilityman Dylan Moore has a pending three-year contract worth $8,875,000.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802335,Salman Rushdie gives first interview since 2022 stabbing,"NEW YORK (AP) — Months after being stabbed repeatedly as he prepared to give a lecture, Salman Rushdie is blind in his right eye, struggles to write and, at times, has “frightening” nightmares. 

            But, he said during his first interview since the attack, he still has a feeling of gratitude. 

            “Well, you know, I’ve been better,” he told The New Yorker's David Remnick during an interview published Monday. “But, considering what happened, I’m not so bad.""











            “The big injuries are healed, essentially,"" Rushdie went on to describe. ""I have feeling in my thumb and index finger and in the bottom half of the palm. I’m doing a lot of hand therapy, and I’m told that I’m doing very well.”

            Remnick, who spoke with Rushdie both in person at his agent's office in Manhattan and via Zoom, wrote that the Booker Prize-winning author had lost more than 40 pounds (18 kilograms) and mostly reads through an iPad so he can adjust the lighting and font size. 

            “There is scar tissue on the right side of his face,” Remnick wrote. “He speaks as fluently as ever, but his lower lip droops on one side. The ulnar nerve in his left hand was badly damaged.”

            Rushdie, 75, lived in hiding for years after Iran's Grand Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued a fatwa in 1989 calling for his death because of the alleged blasphemy of the novel “The Satanic Verses.” But he had long since moved about freely, with minimal security, and did not feel any sense of risk last August about appearing at the Chautauqua Institution, a nonprofit education and retreat center in western New York.

            Rushdie was on stage when approached by a young man dressed in black and carrying a knife. The alleged assailant, Hadi Matar, has pleaded not guilty to charges of assault and attempted murder. During his New Yorker interview, Rushdie referred to Matar as an ""idiot,” but otherwise said he felt no anger. 

            “I’ve tried very hard over these years to avoid recrimination and bitterness,” he said. “I just think it’s not a good look. One of the ways I’ve dealt with this whole thing is to look forward and not backwards. What happens tomorrow is more important than what happened yesterday.”

            The interview came out on the eve of the publication of Rushdie's new novel, “Victory City,” which he completed a month before he was attacked. Featuring a protagonist who lives to be 247, “Victory” is a characteristically surreal and exuberant narrative about an imagined ancient poem that has received highly favorable reviews, with The Washington Post's Ron Charles writing that “Rushdie’s magical style unfurls wonders.”

            Rushdie had been silent for months on social media, but now tweets on occasion and even responds to insults. When a tweeter last week told him he was living a “disgraceful life,” Rushdie answered, “Oh, another fan! So pleased.” 

            During his interview, he noted ruefully that sales for his book had soared after the stabbing, as if he were more popular when in danger.

            “Now that I’ve almost died, everybody loves me,” he said. ""That was my mistake, back then. Not only did I live but I tried to live well. Bad mistake. Get 15 stab wounds, much better.”

            On Monday, he tweeted a picture of himself, staring directly into the camera lens — his face thinner than in photos from before the stabbing, his right eye covered by a dark lens in his glasses frame. 

            He is otherwise still trying to recover. Rushdie has written that he initially had difficulty writing fiction after the fatwa, and he is having a hard time now, saying that he will sit down to work and “nothing happens,"" just a “combination of blankness and junk.” 

            One project he may attempt: a follow-up to his 2012 memoir “Joseph Anton,” which he wrote in the third person. 

            “This doesn’t feel third-person-ish to me,” Rushdie said of a possible sequel. “I think when somebody sticks a knife into you, that’s a first-person story. That’s an ‘I’ story.”NEW YORK (AP) — Months after being stabbed repeatedly as he prepared to give a lecture, Salman Rushdie is blind in his right eye, struggles to write and, at times, has “frightening” nightmares.But, he said during his first interview since the attack, he still has a feeling of gratitude.“Well, you know, I’ve been better,” he told The New Yorker's David Remnick during an interview published Monday. “But, considering what happened, I’m not so bad.""“The big injuries are healed, essentially,"" Rushdie went on to describe. ""I have feeling in my thumb and index finger and in the bottom half of the palm. I’m doing a lot of hand therapy, and I’m told that I’m doing very well.”Remnick, who spoke with Rushdie both in person at his agent's office in Manhattan and via Zoom, wrote that the Booker Prize-winning author had lost more than 40 pounds (18 kilograms) and mostly reads through an iPad so he can adjust the lighting and font size.“There is scar tissue on the right side of his face,” Remnick wrote. “He speaks as fluently as ever, but his lower lip droops on one side. The ulnar nerve in his left hand was badly damaged.”Rushdie, 75, lived in hiding for years after Iran's Grand Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued a fatwa in 1989 calling for his death because of the alleged blasphemy of the novel “The Satanic Verses.” But he had long since moved about freely, with minimal security, and did not feel any sense of risk last August about appearing at the Chautauqua Institution, a nonprofit education and retreat center in western New York.Rushdie was on stage when approached by a young man dressed in black and carrying a knife.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802336,Fox's Pereira knows pressure Super Bowl officials are facing,"Mike Pereira knows the pressure Carl Cheffers and his officiating crew will be under during Super Bowl 57 between the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles.

            That’s because he either hired or promoted most of them.

            As the NFL’s vice president of officiating in 2008, Pereira promoted Cheffers from side judge to referee. After 14 years with the league, Pereira retired and joined Fox in 2010 as a rules analyst.











            Pereira’s move to television paved the way for officials to continue to lend their expertise once they left the field. It has also increased scrutiny on officials with each replay decision or close call analyzed.

            Pereira, who will be in the booth for his fifth Super Bowl with Fox, knows that a call in the biggest game of the season is the last thing an official wants to be known for.

            “I have always felt you are remembered by your performance in the Super Bowl,” Pereira said. “There’s no doubt that each of those guys on the field feels the pressure. I think every official likes a challenge.”

            Fox went into uncharted waters by hiring Pereira, so much so that neither party knew his role during the week. The original plan was for Pereira to write a column and create a video rulebook online so fans could learn the rules. It was a last-minute decision by then-Fox Sports president David Hill before the 2010 openers to have Pereira in the studio in Los Angeles in case there was a play that needed a rules interpretation.

            Thanks to Hall of Famer Calvin Johnson, Pereira made an immediate impact.

            During the fourth quarter of the Detroit Lions game against the Chicago Bears, Johnson appeared to catch what would have been the game-winning touchdown. Johnson came down with the ball as his back and knee hit the ground, which most considered a touchdown. 

            However, under the NFL’s process of completing the catch rules at the time, Johnson lost control of the ball after his hand hit the ground, which made it incomplete.

            “It looked like the winning touchdown pass to everyone except the people in New York and me. I went on air and described why I thought they would leave it as an incomplete pass,” Pereira said. “I think that one play defined how this position would work, whether it was Fox or any other network.

            “I don’t think anybody necessarily thought at that time that it would expand to all the other networks, but it went from an internet to on-air presence.”

            Pereira’s role has expanded to most weeks in the booth with Fox’s top broadcast team of Kevin Burkhardt and Greg Olsen. 

            Dean Blandino, who worked under Pereira in the league office and eventually became VP of officiating, said there was a little trepidation when Pereira moved to Fox because of the unknown.

            “I think ultimately it became a positive and allowed someone with that expertise to explain things rather than have fans sit at home wondering what just happened,” said Blandino, who joined Fox in 2017. “They might disagree with the call or the rule, but at least they understand the basic concept.”

            John Parry, who has been with ESPN since 2019, said the opinion of officials at the time Pereira started at Fox was good because it gave viewers a window into the decision-making process.

            Opinions about rules analysts have also, at times, become polarizing, depending on the officials’ performances. During the conference championship games, the hashtag #NFLRigged was trending on social media because of what many deemed to be poor calls.

            In the case of Pereira, Parry, CBS’ Gene Steratore, and NBC’s Terry McAulay, sometimes the less they are on the air, the better because it means there isn’t an officiating controversy.

            Both Pereira and Parry said the attention on Cheffers and his crew has ramped up because of what happened with calls in both conference championship games. 

            Parry compared it to when he was the referee for Super Bowl 53. The main topic leading into that game was the blown pass interference call between the Los Angeles Rams and New Orleans Saints in the NFC title game.

            “That’s all anyone talked about — how bad officiating was, the wrong team went, and how can they not fix that? So you walk into Atlanta, and you know, every eye is on us. So the pressure for that one was huge,” said Parry, who will be part of ESPN's Super Bowl feed to Australia.

            Pereira said that Cheffers calling his second Super Bowl in three years is a positive, even if others point out what his crew did during the regular season and playoffs.

            Super Bowl assignments, though, are awarded to the top officials at each position.

            “You’re already hearing stuff about people saying, ‘Well, Carl’s crew called the most penalties this year,’ They did, but this is not a crew assignment, so it’s not a way to judge,” Pereira said. “I’ve got an ultimate comfort level when it comes to how Carl will do.

            “As difficult as it was in the (conference) championship games, if you have a nice solid performance, and nobody says anything about you on social media or in the newspapers afterward. It soothes a lot of nerves.”

(AP) — A rancher who lives near Arizona's border with Mexico is being held on a charge of first-degree murder in last week’s fatal shooting of a man tentatively identified as a Mexican citizen. His bail was set at $1 million. 

            The Santa Cruz County Sheriff's office in Nogales, Arizona, confirmed Monday that George Alan Kelly, 73, was arrested last week in the killing. Authorities believe the victim was Gabriel Cuen-Butimea, 48, who lived just south of the border in Nogales, Mexico, because of a Mexican voter registration card he carried.

            The killing occurred Jan. 30 in the Kino Springs area just outside Nogales, Arizona, said Sheriff's Chief Deputy Gerardo Castillo. The address where the killing happened is the same one listed in public records for Kelly's cattle ranch. 











            Details about the shooting were sketchy and it was unknown if the two men previously knew each other. Authorities have not given a motive.

            Kelly was being held at the Santa Cruz County Jail after hisarraignment in the county's Justice Court last week. He is set to return to court Wednesday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802339,Qatar hires coach Carlos Queiroz through the 2026 World Cup,"DOHA, Qatar (AP) — Former Portugal and Iran coach Carlos Queiroz has worked at the last four World Cups and was hired on Monday by Qatar to aim for a fifth straight at the next edition hosted in North America.

            The Qatar Football Association hired former Real Madrid coach Queiroz until 2026 to take charge of his seventh different national team.

            As host of the 2022 World Cup, Qatar lost all three group-stage games on its tournament debut in November. This time it will try to advance through the qualifying program for the first time.











            The 2026 edition in the United States, Canada and Mexico is the first 48-team finals tournament and Asia will have eight guaranteed qualifying places instead of the previous four.

            Queiroz coached Iran at a third straight World Cup together since 2014 and again failed to advance to the round of 16. His team lost to England and the United States, though beat Wales, to place third in their group.

            Queiroz, who turns 70 on March 1, coached his native Portugal at the 2010 World Cup and lost in the round of 16 to eventual winner Spain.

            Qatar under Queiroz has two continental championships to play in the next year, first with an invitation to the CONCACAF Gold Cup in June. Qatar also hosts the Asian Cup in January.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802341,UN chief fears world is heading toward a wider war,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The United Nations chief warned Monday that the world is facing a convergence of challenges “unlike any in our lifetimes” and expressed fear of a wider war as the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine approaches.

            Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said experts who surveyed the state of the world in 2023 set the Doomsday Clock at 90 seconds to midnight — the closest ever to “total global catastrophe,” 

            He pointed to the war in Ukraine, “runaway climate catastrophe, rising nuclear threats,” the widening gulf between the world’s haves and have-nots, and the “epic geopolitical divisions” undermining “global solidarity and trust.”











            In a wide-ranging address Guterres urged the General Assembly’s 193 member nations to change their mindset on decision-making from near-term thinking, which he called “irresponsible” and “immoral,” to looking “at what will happen to all of us tomorrow — and act.”

            He said this year's 75th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights should serve as a reminder that the foundation of the inalienable rights of all people is “freedom, justice and peace.”

            Guterres said the transformation needed today must start with peace, beginning in Ukraine — where unfortunately, he said, peace prospects “keep diminishing” and “the chances of further escalation and bloodshed keep growing.”

            “I fear the world is not sleepwalking into a wider war. It is doing so with its eyes wide open,” he said.

            The world must work harder for peace, Guterres said, not only in Ukraine but in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict “where the two-state solution is growing more distant by the day,” in Afghanistan where the rights of women and girls “are being trampled and deadly terrorist attacks continue” and in Africa’s Sahel region where security is deteriorating “at an alarming rate.” 

            He also called for stepped up peace efforts in military-ruled Myanmar which is facing new violence and repression, in Haiti where gangs are holding the country hostage, “and elsewhere around the world for the two billion people who live in countries affected by conflict and humanitarian crises.”

            The secretary-general said it is time for all countries to recommit to the U.N. Charter, which calls for peaceful settlement of disputes, and for a new focus on conflict prevention and reconciliation. 

            The proposed new U.N. Agenda for Peace, he said, calls for “a new generation of peace enforcement missions and counter-terrorist operations, led by regional forces,” with a U.N. Security Council mandate that can be enforced militarily and guaranteed funding. “The African Union is an obvious partner in this regard,” he added.

            Guterres also said it is time for nuclear-armed countries to renounce the first use of all nuclear weapons, including tactical nuclear weapons, a possible use that Russia has raised in Ukraine.

            “The so-called `tactical’ use of nuclear weapons is absurd,” he said. “We are at the highest risk in decades of a nuclear war that could start by accident or design. We need to end the threat posed by 13,000 nuclear weapons held in arsenals around the world.”

            As for the global financial system, Guterres called for “radical transformation” to put the needs of developing countries at the center of every decision.

            He pointed to rising poverty and hunger around the world, developing countries forced to pay five times more to borrow money than advanced economies, vulnerable middle-income countries denied concessional funding and debt relief, and the richest 1% of the world’s people capturing “almost half of all new wealth over the past decade.”

            Multilateral development banks must change their business model to invest more capital in developing countries to achieve U.N. goals including ending extreme poverty and addressing climate change, Guterres said.

            Guterres told diplomats that 2023 must also be “a year of game-changing climate action,” not of excuses or baby steps — and there must be “no more bottomless greed of the fossil fuel industry and its enablers.”

            The world must focus on cutting global-warming greenhouse gas emissions by half this decade, which means far more ambitious action to cut carbon pollution by speeding the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy, especially in the world’s 20 richest global economies, he said. 

            It also means cutting emissions from the highest emitting industrial sectors — steel, cement, shipping and aviation, he said.

            Guterres had a special message for fossil fuel producers who he said are scrambling to expand production “and raking in monster profits.”

            “If you cannot set a credible course for net-zero, with 2025 and 2030 targets covering all your operations, you should not be in business,” he said.

            The secretary-general invited any leader in government, business or civil society to the Climate Ambition Summit he is convening in September — with a condition.

            “Show us accelerated action in this decade and renewed ambitious net zero plans — or please don’t show up,” Guterres said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802342,Seven-time Pro Bowl WR A.J. Green retires after 12 seasons,"PHOENIX (AP) — Seven-time Pro Bowl receiver A.J. Green retired on Monday after 12 seasons in the NFL.

            The 34-year-old spent a decade with the Cincinnati Bengals before signing with the Arizona Cardinals for the last two seasons of his career.

            Selected by the Bengals with the No. 4 overall pick of the 2011 draft out of Georgia, Green was a Pro Bowl selection in each of his first seven seasons, topping 1,000 yards receiving six times.











            The 6-foot-4, 207-pounder had a rare blend of size and speed and his low-key personality made him a favorite among teammates. He teamed with quarterback Andy Dalton to lead the Bengals to the playoffs every year from 2011 to 2015, though they never won a game in the postseason.

            “I’ve never been a man of many words, so I’ll keep this short,” Green wrote in an Instagram post. “Thank you. Thank you to all who have supported, encouraged, and inspired me throughout my career. 

            ""Special thank you to the University of Georgia, Cincinnati Bengals, and Arizona Cardinals for the opportunity to pursue my dreams. I’ve stayed true to the game and it owes me nothing. Be blessed.. Love y’all! The next chapter begins…”

            He missed the 2019 season with an ankle injury, but returned to the Bengals in 2020.

            Green was solid in his first season with the Cardinals in 2021, catching 54 passes for 848 yards and three TDs. His production dipped to 24 catches for 236 yards and two TDs this season, though he remained a popular presence in the Cardinals locker room.

            He finishes his career with 10,514 yards receiving — which ranks 44th in NFL history — and had 70 touchdown catches.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802343,"Officer killed, 2nd wounded in western Pennsylvania shootout","MCKEESPORT, Pa. (AP) — A man having a “mental health crisis” shot and killed a police officer, wounded a second and fired at a third before being wounded in a shootout in a western Pennsylvania city on Monday, authorities said.

            Two officers were dispatched shortly after noon to a domestic disturbance call in McKeesport, about 12 miles (20 kilometers) south of Pittsburgh, Allegheny County Police Superintendent Christopher Kearns said at a news conference. 

            The officers tried to talk to the man but he walked away from the home, and officers were warned by a family member that he might be armed, Kearns said. The officers encountered him nearby and he “suddenly produced a handgun and shot the two McKeesport officers,"" Kearns said. 











            One officer was taken to a hospital in McKeesport, where he was pronounced dead. A statement from McKeesport Police Chief Adam Alfer identified him as 32-year-old Sean Sluganski, who had worked for the department full-time for two years. 

            The second officer, 35-year-old Charles Thomas Jr., was flown to a Pittsburgh-area trauma center. Thomas, who has been on the force for four years, was discharged by Monday night and back home recovering with family, Alfer reported. 

            Kearns said the suspect was shot when he walked around a corner and fired at the third officer, who returned fire. 

            The suspect was later listed in stable condition at a Pittsburgh-area trauma center. 

            The McKeesport Area School District said all schools and buildings were temporarily put on an exterior lockdown due to the police activity nearby.

            Police said charges were being prepared against the suspect, who is known to McKeesport police. “They have dealt with him on past occasions,” Kearns said. 

            The mayor's office asked people to keep the department in their thoughts and to respect the families’ privacy “during this tragic and traumatic time.” 

            The president of the Fraternal Order of Police state lodge, Joseph Regan, said the officers “left their homes knowing it was their duty to protect and serve McKeesport regardless of the outcome. 

            “Today, they made sacrifices we hoped and prayed they would never need to make. They are heroes,” Regan said.

            About a month ago, a police chief was killed and two officers wounded in an Allegheny County borough northeast of Pittsburgh. The suspect was later shot and killed in Pittsburgh after crashing a carjacked vehicle and exchanging gunfire with police, authorities said.MCKEESPORT, Pa.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802344,"Generators, spoiled food: Slow power repairs anger Austin","AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Like thousands of other Austin residents, Darin Murphy began a sixth day Monday with no power in his home, wrapping his head around the city's latest demoralizing update: Getting the lights fully back on may take another week.

            “We are planning for worst-case scenario,” he said.

            Making any plans has been difficult — and downright infuriating — for nearly 20,000 customers who still had no electricity Monday nearly a week after a deadly ice storm crippled the Texas capital and brought down power lines under the weight of fallen and frozen tree limbs. Schools finally reopened, but noisy generators rattled before dawn and outdoor extension cords running 100 feet (30 meters) or longer became lifelines between neighbors who had power and those who didn't. 











            The boiling frustration over the slow pace of restoring power, and officials repeatedly saying they could not offer timetables for repairs, escalated Monday as the future of Austin's top city executive plunged into jeopardy even as the number of outages continued falling. 

            Austin Mayor Kirk Watson, a Democrat, called a meeting for this week that will put City Manager Spencer Cronk's job on the line. The move reflected the rising discontent in America's 11th-largest city, where late Sunday night, Austin Energy issued a statement in the face of growing criticism that full power restoration may not happen until Feb. 12 — nearly two weeks after the outages began.

            “To all our Austin citizens who are furious about the ongoing power outage, you’re right,” Watson tweeted. “There must be accountability.” 

            Cronk, who oversees city staff, responded by telling reporters he was focused on the storm recovery and restoring power. Watson did not outright say whether he thinks Cronk should be fired but said Thursday's meeting would “evaluate the employment"" of the city manager. 

            For the vast majority of Austin residents, the lights were on Monday or never went out in the first place. At the peak of the outages, about 170,000 homes and businesses — nearly a third of utility customers in Austin — had no electricity, and in many cases, no heat. By Monday, the outages were down to about 4% of all customers. 

            But in neighborhoods still without power, familiar scenes unfolded.

            Spoiled food piled up in trash bins. Power outlets in coffee shops and restaurants were snatched up by people charging battery packs and devices. And on text message groups and social media apps, the sights of repair crews were treated as urgent developments. 

            Katy Manganella, 37, grew so fed up that when Austin Energy came to her neighborhood Sunday with a charging station for residents — but still no repair trucks — she paced in front of the station holding a poster that read, “This pregnant lady is over it!”

            “It’s been pretty miserable,” said Manganella, a therapist who is seven months pregnant and was unable to work last week because of the outages. “How is there no plan for this?” 

            Austin Energy has described the remaining outages as the most complicated and time-consuming. The storm plunged temperatures near or below freezing and coated trees with ice across Austin, weighing down branches that eventually snapped and crashed onto power lines. Iced-over equipment and crews driving on slick roads also slowed recovery efforts, according to city officials. 

            Crews have also come across “irate customers” out in the field, said Craig Brooks, director of operations for Austin Energy, including one instance in which police were called. He did not provide specifics about the encounters, describing them as, “Some verbal. Some people protecting their property.”

            The utility warned Monday that a new front of high winds and potential storms starting Tuesday could further hamper restoration efforts.AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Like thousands of other Austin residents, Darin Murphy began a sixth day Monday with no power in his home, wrapping his head around the city's latest demoralizing update: Getting the lights fully back on may take another week.“We are planning for worst-case scenario,” he said.Making any plans has been difficult — and downright infuriating — for nearly 20,000 customers who still had no electricity Monday nearly a week after a deadly ice storm crippled the Texas capital and brought down power lines under the weight of fallen and frozen tree limbs.

And on text message groups and social media apps, the sights of repair crews were treated as urgent developments.Katy Manganella, 37, grew so fed up that when Austin Energy came to her neighborhood Sunday with a charging station for residents — but still no repair trucks — she paced in front of the station holding a poster that read, “This pregnant lady is over it!”“It’s been pretty miserable,” said Manganella, a therapist who is seven months pregnant and was unable to work last week because of the outages. “How is there no plan for this?”Austin Energy has described the remaining outages as the most complicated and time-consuming. The storm plunged temperatures near or below freezing and coated trees with ice across Austin, weighing down branches that eventually snapped and crashed onto power lines. Iced-over equipment and crews driving on slick roads also slowed recovery efforts, according to city officials.Crews have also come across “irate customers” out in the field, said Craig Brooks, director of operations for Austin Energy, including one instance in which police were called. He did not provide specifics about the encounters, describing them as, “Some verbal. Some people protecting their property.”The utility warned Monday that a new front of high winds and potential storms starting Tuesday could further hamper restoration efforts.",2023/2/7,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802345,Alabama AG: Inmate didn't suffer in aborted lethal injection,"MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) — Arguing against a lawsuit, Alabama's attorney general contended that an inmate did not suffer unconstitutionally during a lethal injection that was called off last year when the execution team couldn't establish an intravenous line despite repeated attempts. 

            Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall's office asked a judge to dismiss the lawsuit filed by Kenneth Eugene Smith seeking to prevent the state from making a second attempt to put him to death. The attorney general argued that repeatedly being pricked with a needle does not rise to the level of cruel and unusual punishment and that Smith did not suffer unconstitutional pain and mental anguish during the attempted execution. 

            ""Allegations of pain related to difficulty achieving intravenous access do not amount to cruel and unusual punishment,” lawyers for the state wrote in the Monday court filing. 











            Smith was scheduled to be put to death by lethal injection on Nov. 17 for the 1988 murder-for-hire slaying of Elizabeth Dorlene Sennett. Prison officials called off Smith’s execution for the night after they were unable to establish IV access.

            The failed execution was the second instance that year of Alabama being unable to carry out an execution because of difficulties connecting intravenous access and its third since 2018.

            The problems led to Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey seeking a pause in executions to conduct a “top-to-bottom” review of the state’s capital punishment system. 

            The Alabama Supreme Court, at Ivey’s request, abolished the previous one-day timeframe to carry out a death sentence. Instead, the governor will set a window of time for the execution to be carried out. The prison system had blamed last-minute legal filings — combined with a midnight deadline to get the execution started — as a reason for calling off Smith's execution. 

            Smith's lawyers argued in the court filing that Smith was “subjected to ever-escalating levels of pain and torture” on the night of the “botched” execution. They argued prison staff strapped Smith to a death chamber gurney, despite a court order in place at the time blocking the execution from going forward, and later subjected him to numerous needle jabs, including in the neck and collarbone regionMONTGOMERY, Ala.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802346,Nielsen lays out goal for Falcons D: Just get stops,"FLOWERY BRANCH, Ga. (AP) — At the start of his first week at the Atlanta Falcons practice facility, new defensive coordinator Ryan Nielsen said he’s not willing to commit to a 4-3 or 3-4 as the base alignment of his multiple schemes.

            “Let’s just stop people,” Nielsen said Monday.

            Nielsen, the former co-defensive coordinator for the New Orleans Saints, was hired by Atlanta on Jan. 27 to replace Dean Pees, who retired at 73.











            Nielsen, 43, takes over a unit which ranked 27th in total defense, allowing 362.1 yards per game. Atlanta ranked 31st with 21 sacks.

            Atlanta's defense gained momentum in Pees' second and final season, allowing no more than 25 points in the final nine games of a 7-10 season and under 20 points in five of the last six games.

            Nielsen said he wants to build on Pees' work, not start over.

            “Dean has done a great job here,” Nielsen said. “We don’t want to just blow everything up and start all over again. We’re going to take what we’ve done well here the last couple of years and implement some new things, put in some new ideas and just kind of marry it.”

            A chronic weak spot on defense has been the pass rush. Atlanta ranked 31st with 21 sacks after finishing last in 2021.

            Nielsen, who also coached the Saints defensive line, has had success in helping to devise successful pass rushes. He joined the Saints staff in 2017, and New Orleans finished in the top 10 in sacks in five of his six seasons. 

            The search for an edge rusher could rank near the top of the Falcons' needs during free agency and the draft.

            “We’ll get it going,” said Nielsen when asked about the pass rush.

            Nielsen joined coach Arthur Smith, general manager Terry Fontenot and the coaching staff at the East-West Shrine Bowl in Las Vegas last week. Fontenot worked 18 years with the Saints before he was hired by Atlanta in 2021.

            “Obviously, Terry and I have a relationship in the past, so that part was easy,” Nielsen said, adding the leadership with Falcons owner Arthur Blank, Fontenot and Smith was important in his decision to leave New Orleans.

            “It’s the right fit,” Nielsen said. “Ownership, head coach, general manager who see a lot of things the same. The way this program is going, the organization and how guys play. Definitely the right fit and the place I want to be.”

            Nielsen said there's no need to classify his defense as a four-man or three-man front because it will employ principles of each scheme.

            “You guys can call it whatever you want to call it,” he said.

            “We’re going to be multiple in what we do and it may look 3-4 but it also may look 4-3,” Nielsen said.

            When announcing Nielsen's hire, the Falcons said three defensive assistants will not return next season: defensive line coach Gary Emanuel, outside linebackers coach Ted Monachino and secondary coach Jon Hoke.

            Smith hired former Green Bay defensive backs coach Jerry Gray as assistant head coach for defense last week.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802352,Boy who shot teacher allegedly tried to choke another,"RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — A 6-year-old Virginia boy who shot and wounded his first-grade teacher constantly cursed at staff and teachers, tried to whip students with his belt and once choked another teacher “until she couldn't breathe,” according to a legal notice filed by an attorney for the wounded teacher.

            The incidents were described in a notice sent to the Newport News school district by Diane Toscano, an attorney for teacher Abby Zwerner, informing the district that Zwerner intends to sue. The notice of claim, which was obtained by The Associated Press through a public records request, outlines prior behavioral issues the boy had at Richneck Elementary School and troubling interactions he had with teachers and students.

            Two days before the shooting, the boy allegedly “slammed” Zwerner's cellphone and broke it, according to the claim notice. He was given a one-day suspension, but when he returned to Zwerner's class the following day, he pulled a 9mm handgun out of his pocket and shot her while she sat at a reading table, the notice says.











            “It is a miracle that more people were not harmed,"" Toscano wrote in her notice. “The shooter spent his entire recess with a gun in his pocket, a gun that was loaded and ready to fire ... while lots of first-grade students played.”

            The details in the notice of intent to sue, including the allegation that the boy attempted to choke another teacher, were first reported by the Daily Press of Newport News.

            The choking incident described in the notice was confirmed by the teacher. She said that in 2021, the boy came up behind her as she sat in a chair in the front of the class, locked his forearms in front of her neck and pulled back and down, hard. She said a teaching assistant pulled the boy off her.

            The teacher requested anonymity because she fears potential retaliation from the school district. She said she reported the incident to school administrators, but did not receive the kind of supportive response she had hoped for from them.

            “I didn't feel safe the rest of the year because I knew if they didn't protect me when he choked me and I couldn't breathe, then they wouldn't protect me, my kids or my colleagues if he did something not as harmful,” she told The Associated Press.

            The boy was later moved into another class in another school.

            After the shooting, police said the boy was taken to a medical facility where he is receiving unspecified services.

            The legal notice sent fleshed out Zwerner's allegations of negligence at Richneck on the morning of Jan. 6, which Toscano had first outlined last month at a news conference. 

            A detailed timeline describes how Zwerner, three other teachers and a guidance counselor were involved in airing concerns about the child possibly having a gun. 

            “If Assistant Principal (Ebony) Parker had acted on the information she was provided, then the shooting of Ms. Zwerner would not have happened,” the notice stated. 

            Zwerner went to former Assistant Principal Parker's office at about 11:15 a.m. “to advise her that the shooter seemed more ‘off’ than usual and was in a violent mood."" It also says the boy had threatened to beat up a kindergarten student and “angrily stared down” the school security officer in the lunch room.

            At about 11:45 a.m. another teacher learned that the boy had told students he had a gun in his backpack, the notice stated. The teacher searched the backpack at about 12:30 p.m. but found no gun. 

            The same teacher “was made aware that the shooter had taken something out of his backpack right before she searched the shooter’s backpack, and the shooter put it in the pocket of his hoodie before going out to recess,” the notice stated.

            When that teacher raised concerns to Parker, the assistant principal said the student “had small pockets, insinuating that he could not possibly have a gun on his person,” the notice of claim stated. 

            “Assistant Principal Parker should have called police,” the notice stated. “Instead, she did not follow proper protocol and chose to do absolutely nothing.”

            Shortly after 1 p.m., a third teacher learned from a student in Zwerner’s class that the shooter showed him the gun during recess and threatened to shoot him if he told anyone, the notice stated. 

            That teacher called the school’s office and shared what she knew with a fourth teacher who picked up the phone, the notice stated. The fourth teacher relayed the information to Parker, who said she was aware of the threat and that the student’s backpack had been searched.

            The third and fourth teachers conferred again. And the fourth teacher returned to Parker's office, where a guidance counselor was raising similar concerns about the student having a gun, the notice stated. 

            The guidance counselor asked if he could search the child for a weapon, to which Parker said “no” because the child’s mother was arriving soon to pick him up, the notice stated. 

            “Then approximately 45 minutes later Ms. Zwerner was shot in her left hand and upper chest by the shooter,” the notice stated. “Ms. Zwerner was sitting at her reading table when the shooter, who was sitting at his desk, pulled the gun out of his pocket and shot her one time.” 

            Parker, who resigned from her position last month, could not immediately be reached for comment. A spokeswoman for the school district said she did not know if Parker has retained an attorney.

            Len Wallin, director of legal services for the school system, said in an email that it’s standard practice for the school division to forward notices of intent to sue to its insurer, which handles such litigation.

            Wallin said the district’s insurer will handle decisions regarding whether it will represent Parker or not “after consultation with the school board, if that is necessary.”

            In the meantime, Toscano wrote in her notice that Zwerner's is continuing to recover physically and from psychological wounds that “cut deeply and remain fresh.” 

            “It is my hope that the school district will not want to drag Ms. Zwerner through litigation after the trauma she has sustained,” Toscano wrote. 

            “The response from the school district is going to be very important and will shed light on how it views its teachers,"" Toscano continued. I hope that the school district will not send a message that being shot while teaching a lesson in class by a student is merely a hazard of the job.”

(AP) — A 6-year-old Virginia boy who shot and wounded his first-grade teacher constantly cursed at staff and teachers, tried to whip students with his belt and once choked another teacher “until she couldn't breathe,” according to a legal notice filed by an attorney for the wounded teacher.The incidents were described in a notice sent to the Newport News school district by Diane Toscano, an attorney for teacher Abby Zwerner, informing the district that Zwerner intends to sue. The notice of claim, which was obtained by The Associated Press through a public records request, outlines prior behavioral issues the boy had at Richneck Elementary School and troubling interactions he had with teachers and students.Two days before the shooting, the boy allegedly “slammed” Zwerner's cellphone and broke it, according to the claim notice. He was given a one-day suspension, but when he returned to Zwerner's class the following day, he pulled a 9mm handgun out of his pocket and shot her while she sat at a reading table, the notice says.“It is a miracle that more people were not harmed,"" Toscano wrote in her notice. “The shooter spent his entire recess with a gun in his pocket, a gun that was loaded and ready to fire ... while lots of first-grade students played.”The details in the notice of intent to sue, including the allegation that the boy attempted to choke another teacher, were first reported by the Daily Press of Newport News.The choking incident described in the notice was confirmed by the teacher. She said that in 2021, the boy came up behind her as she sat in a chair in the front of the class, locked his forearms in front of her neck and pulled back and down, hard. She said a teaching assistant pulled the boy off her.The teacher requested anonymity because she fears potential retaliation from the school district. She said she reported the incident to school administrators, but did not receive the kind of supportive response she had hoped for from them.“I didn't feel safe the rest of the year because I knew if they didn't protect me when he choked me and I couldn't breathe, then they wouldn't protect me, my kids or my colleagues if he did something not as harmful,” she told The Associated Press.The boy was later moved into another class in another school.After the shooting, police said the boy was taken to a medical facility where he is receiving unspecified services.The legal notice sent fleshed out Zwerner's allegations of negligence at Richneck on the morning of Jan. 6, which Toscano had first outlined last month at a news conference.A detailed timeline describes how Zwerner, three other teachers and a guidance counselor were involved in airing concerns about the child possibly having a gun.“If Assistant Principal (Ebony) Parker had acted on the information she was provided, then the shooting of Ms. Zwerner would not have happened,” the notice stated.Zwerner went to former Assistant Principal Parker's office at about 11:15 a.m. “to advise her that the shooter seemed more ‘off’ than usual and was in a violent mood."" It also says the boy had threatened to beat up a kindergarten student and “angrily stared down” the school security officer in the lunch room.At about 11:45 a.m. another teacher learned that the boy had told students he had a gun in his backpack, the notice stated. The teacher searched the backpack at about 12:30 p.m. but found no gun.The same teacher “was made aware that the shooter had taken something out of his backpack right before she searched the shooter’s backpack, and the shooter put it in the pocket of his hoodie before going out to recess,” the notice stated.When that teacher raised concerns to Parker, the assistant principal said the student “had small pockets, insinuating that he could not possibly have a gun on his person,” the notice of claim stated.“Assistant Principal Parker should have called police,” the notice stated. “Instead, she did not follow proper protocol and chose to do absolutely nothing.”Shortly after 1 p.m., a third teacher learned from a student in Zwerner’s class that the shooter showed him the gun during recess and threatened to shoot him if he told anyone, the notice stated.That teacher called the school’s office and shared what she knew with a fourth teacher who picked up the phone, the notice stated. The fourth teacher relayed the information to Parker, who said she was aware of the threat and that the student’s backpack had been searched.The third and fourth teachers conferred again. And the fourth teacher returned to Parker's office, where a guidance counselor was raising similar concerns about the student having a gun, the notice stated.The guidance counselor asked if he could search the child for a weapon, to which Parker said “no” because the child’s mother was arriving soon to pick him up, the notice stated.“Then approximately 45 minutes later Ms. Zwerner was shot in her left hand and upper chest by the shooter,” the notice stated. “Ms. Zwerner was sitting at her reading table when the shooter, who was sitting at his desk, pulled the gun out of his pocket and shot her one time.”Parker, who resigned from her position last month, could not immediately be reached for comment. A spokeswoman for the school district said she did not know if Parker has retained an attorney.Len Wallin, director of legal services for the school system, said in an email that it’s standard practice for the school division to forward notices of intent to sue to its insurer, which handles such litigation.Wallin said the district’s insurer will handle decisions regarding whether it will represent Parker or not “after consultation with the school board, if that is necessary.”In the meantime, Toscano wrote in her notice that Zwerner's is continuing to recover physically and from psychological wounds that “cut deeply and remain fresh.”“It is my hope that the school district will not want to drag Ms. Zwerner through litigation after the trauma she has sustained,” Toscano wrote.“The response from the school district is going to be very important and will shed light on how it views its teachers,"" Toscano continued. I hope that the school district will not send a message that being shot while teaching a lesson in class by a student is merely a hazard of the job.”____Finley reported from Norfolk, Virginia.____For more coverage of the shooting: https://apnews.com/hub/newport-news",2023/2/8,,World

            Bard initially will be available exclusively to a group of “trusted testers"" before being widely released later this year, according to a Monday blog post from Google CEO Sundar Pichai.

            Google's chatbot is supposed to be able to explain complex subjects such as outer space discoveries in terms simple enough for a child to understand. It also claims the service will also perform other more mundane tasks, such as providing tips for planning a party, or lunch ideas based on what food is left in a refrigerator. Pichai didn't say in his post whether Bard will be able to write prose in the vein of William Shakespeare, the playwright who apparently inspired the service's name.











            “Bard can be an outlet for creativity, and a launchpad for curiosity,"" Pichai wrote. 

            Google announced Bard's existence less than two weeks after Microsoft disclosed it's pouring billions of dollars into OpenAI, the San Francisco-based maker of ChatGPT and other tools that can write readable text and generate new images.

            Microsoft's decision to up the ante on a $1 billion investment that it previously made in OpenAI in 2019 intensified the pressure on Google to demonstrate that it will be able to keep pace in a field of technology that many analysts believe will be as transformational as personal computers, the internet and smartphones have been in various stages over the past 40 years.

            In a report last week, CNBC said a team of Google engineers working on artificial intelligence technology “has been asked to prioritize working on a response to ChatGPT."" Bard had been a service being developed under a project called “Atlas,"" as part of Google's “code red” effort to counter the success of ChatGPT, which has attracted tens of millions of users since its general release late last year, while also raising concerns in schools about its ability to write entire essays for students.

            Pichai has been emphasizing the importance of artificial intelligence for the past six years, with one of the most visible byproducts materializing in 2021 as part of a system called “Language Model for Dialogue Applications,"" or LaMDA, which will be used to power Bard.

            Google also plans to begin incorporating LaMDA and other artificial intelligence advancements into its dominant search engine to provide more helpful answers to the increasingly complicated questions being posed by its billion of users. Without providing a specific timeline, Pichai indicated the artificial intelligence tools will be deployed in Google's search in the near future.

            In another sign of Google's deepening commitment to the field, Google announced last week that it is investing in and partnering with Anthropic, an AI startup led by some former leaders at OpenAI.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802366,"The Grammys ended in controversy, again. Here’s what to know","NEW YORK (AP) — A night in music brimming with shocking upsets, historic wins, tributes for artists like the late rapper Takeoff and hip-hop’s 50th anniversary, the 65th Grammys were back in full swing Sunday. Once again, Beyoncé was in the running for the top honor.

            Once again, the show ended with someone else winning album of the year.

            This year was widely seen as a chance for the Grammys to honor the superstar with a marquee award, especially on a night where she could have ( and did ) become its most decorated artist.











            Instead, Harry Styles won, and a line from his acceptance speech stung those who thought Beyoncé should have won.

            Here’s what happened, how it’s been perceived and who picks the Grammys’ top honors. 

            WHAT’S CONTROVERSIAL ABOUT STYLES’ WIN?

            Styles won for his third album, “Harry’s House,” and even he seemed surprised when his name was called.

            The British pop star was competing against other giants in the industry: acts like ABBA, Adele, Bad Bunny, Brandi Carlile, Coldplay, Lizzo, Kendrick Lamar, and Beyoncé.

            While accepting the award, he said, “This is really, really kind. I’m so, so grateful... I’m just so — This doesn’t happen to people like me very often. And this is so, so nice. Thank you very, very much.”

            The line, “this doesn’t happen to people like me very often,” drew criticism in the hours after his win.

            Styles was born and raised in Northern England and rose to fame in 2010 when he auditioned for the Simon Cowell-led talent competition show “The X Factor.” He placed third with the boyband One Direction. His solo career has earned him several Grammys and Billboard-charting albums and singles.

            Styles hasn’t said what he meant by his words. Some have interpreted it as him trying to express how far he’d come from his youth. Others, however, see the remark as an example of white privilege.

            WHY ARE PEOPLE MAD AT STYLES’ WORDS?

            Many of Beyoncé’s fans are fiercely protective of the singer. They’re called the Beyhive, after all. 

            Despite Beyoncé’s 32 Grammy wins – the most of any artist in history – many are troubled by the fact she has yet to win album of year and that she’s lost to white musicians every time she has been nominated.

            Washington Post pop music critic Chris Richards, in a story headlined “Beyoncé just made Grammy history. Why does it feel like she still lost?” wrote that her historic achievement feels hollow.

            “Why does that feel like not enough,” Richards asked. “Because for the past 20 years and counting, the Recording Academy has routinely failed to recognize Black artists at their creative peaks — and to her credit, Beyoncé keeps updating that peak with each new album.”

            Similar criticism was raised in other stories and by online commenters, some of whom noted a Black woman hadn’t won album of the year since Lauryn Hill in the late ‘90s.

            Ashley Smalls, a Black feminism and pop culture doctoral student at Penn State University criticized Styles’ speech in a tweet: ”‘this doesn’t happen to people like me very often’ when a Black woman hasn’t won that award since 1999 is crazy lol.” 

            WHAT IS BEYONCÉ’S GRAMMYS HISTORY?

            The artist is tied with her husband, Jay-Z, for most nominations all-time with 88 but she has only won 32 times. Most significantly, Beyoncé has lost album of the year four times to Taylor Swift, Beck, Adele and now Styles.

            Beyoncé has been nominated in each of the most prestigious categories across her decadeslong career but she has won in these categories just once for “Single Ladies (Put a Ring On It).”

            A Black woman has not won album of the year since Lauryn Hill received the accolade for her breakout album, “The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill” in 1999. The last Black person to win the award was Jon Batiste, last year for his album “We Are.”

            WHO DECIDES ALBUM OF THE YEAR?

            
                According to Billboard, the Recording Academy boasts more than 12,000 voting members. The entire membership is allowed to vote in the big four categories — best new artist, record, song and album of the year. Members are also responsible for nominating in their area of expertise, as well as voting on the winners this categories.

            Numerous artists have criticized how the Grammys nominate artists. The Recording Academy is undergoing a campaign to diversify its membership and has a goal of having 2,500 female members by 2025.

            WHAT’S NEXT FOR BEYONCÉ AND STYLES?

            Both are hitting the road for international tours.

            Styles’ next show is in Thailand next week and he’ll play shows in Asia and Europe into the summer. 

            Beyoncé will be starting her “Renaissance” tour in May in Sweden and will play dates in Europe and the United States.

            Trevor Thomas Bickford, handcuffed and shackled at the ankles, slowly shuffled into a Manhattan federal courtroom for an initial appearance. Charges in a federal complaint allege he tried to murder officers and employees of the U.S. government. A U.S. magistrate judge gave prosecutors two weeks to seek an indictment.

            In a soft voice, Bickford answered routine questions from the judge before he was returned to a federal jail after the brief appearance.











            His court-appointed lawyer did not seek bail. She did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

            Bickford, of Wells, Maine, was 19 when authorities said he attacked three police officers with a machete about two hours before the new year began.

            He also faces charges in state court, where prosecutors said he shouted “Allahu akbar” in the New Year's Eve attack before striking one officer in the head and trying to grab another officer's gun. He was shot in the shoulder by police and was taken to a hospital to recover from his injuries.

            Authorities have said he began studying radical Islamic ideology last summer before deciding in November to wage jihad against U.S. officials and officials of other governments he thought to be anti-Muslim.

            “Bickford intended to die in the attack, in an effort to achieve martyrdom,” the federal complaint said. “Bickford believed his attack was unsuccessful, because he did not kill any officers, and he did not die himself.”NEW YORK (AP) — A man charged with attacking police with a machete near New York’s Times Square on New Year’s Eve was transferred to U.S. custody and made his initial federal court appearance on Monday to face terrorism charges.Trevor Thomas Bickford, handcuffed and shackled at the ankles, slowly shuffled into a Manhattan federal courtroom for an initial appearance.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802370,Polar bear in fatal Alaska attack was in poor health,"ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — A polar bear that killed a young mother and her baby last month in western Alaska was likely an older animal in poor physical condition, but tests came back negative for pathogens that affect the brain and cause aggressive behavior, officials said Monday. 

            Dr. Kimberlee Beckmen, a state wildlife veterinarian, collected and examined samples from the bear’s head the day after the attack, when weather conditions allowed her and an Alaska State Trooper to fly to the village. 

            The results of her analysis, which were released Monday but initially were dated Feb. 3, indicate the bear was an adult male, probably older and in poor physical health. Officials sent a tooth to a lab to determine the bear's age, but those results won’t be known for months.











            Standard tests conducted on available tissues for pathogens were negative for rabies, toxoplasmosis, distemper and avian influenza. 

            “There is no definitive explanation as to why the bear was in poor body condition,” the Alaska Department of Fish and Game and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said in a joint statement. 

            Summer Myomick and her 1-year-old son, Clyde Ongtowasruk, were mauled to death Jan. 17 as they left the school in Wales, Alaska, for a short walk of about 150 yards (137 meters) to the town’s medical clinic. 

            School employees attempted to stop the attack by hitting the bear with shovels, but it turned on them and chased as they went back inside for safety. The principal slammed the door to keep the bear out of the school, which was in session. 

            A village resident later arrived with a gun and killed the animal. 

            It was the first fatal polar bear attack in Alaska in three decades. 

            Polar bears are the largest bear species, according to the Fish and Wildlife Service. Males typically weigh 600 to 1,200 pounds (270 to 540 kilograms) but can be more than 1,700 pounds (770 kilograms) and reach up to 10 feet (3 meters) in length. Females weigh 400 to 700 pounds (180 to 320 kilograms). Polar bears generally feed on seals but also prey on walruses and beluga whales. 

            They were listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act in 2008 and are also protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. Both laws prohibit harming the bears without authorization unless necessary for human safety. 

            Wales, a whaling village of about 160 people, is located about 640 miles (1,300 kilometers) northwest of Anchorage and is accessible by plane or boat.ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — A polar bear that killed a young mother and her baby last month in western Alaska was likely an older animal in poor physical condition, but tests came back negative for pathogens that affect the brain and cause aggressive behavior, officials said Monday.Dr. Kimberlee Beckmen, a state wildlife veterinarian, collected and examined samples from the bear’s head the day after the attack, when weather conditions allowed her and an Alaska State Trooper to fly to the village.The results of her analysis, which were released Monday but initially were dated Feb. 3, indicate the bear was an adult male, probably older and in poor physical health. Officials sent a tooth to a lab to determine the bear's age, but those results won’t be known for months.Standard tests conducted on available tissues for pathogens were negative for rabies, toxoplasmosis, distemper and avian influenza.“There is no definitive explanation as to why the bear was in poor body condition,” the Alaska Department of Fish and Game and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said in a joint statement.Summer Myomick and her 1-year-old son, Clyde Ongtowasruk, were mauled to death Jan. 17 as they left the school in Wales, Alaska, for a short walk of about 150 yards (137 meters) to the town’s medical clinic.School employees attempted to stop the attack by hitting the bear with shovels, but it turned on them and chased as they went back inside for safety.

            García came off the bench in the 63rd minute and scored with his first touch of the ball, sending a low shot from inside the area into the far corner after a breakaway. Vallecano opened the scoring with an own-goal by Almeria defender Rodrigo Ely in the 54th.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802375,UK health workers stage 'biggest NHS strike' in history,"Tens of thousands of nurses and ambulance workers walked off their jobs in England on Monday, demanding better pay.Though strikes have persisted in the country for nearly a year, as workers in different sectors call for pay increases to correspond with two-digit inflation figures and a cost-of-living crisis, Monday was the first time nurses and paramedics both walked out on the same day.The Unite trade union called it the ""biggest NHS strike in our history.""The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) union said planned strikes in Wales were canceled after a new National Health Service pay offer provided by the Welsh government.Nurses argue that their strike is to preserve the profession, which they say many are abandoning in favor of more lucrative jobs.""We're already on our knees. It's only going to get worse because more and more people will leave the profession,"" said trainee nursing associate Victoria Busk, who works on a trauma ward at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, central England. She added that a single nurse was doing the job of three.Others argued that the understaffing issue posed a risk to patients.""Every time you go on a shift, it's dangerous due to low staffing,"" said Angela Unufe on a picket line outside the Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham, also in central England.The nurses strike is scheduled to run for 48 hours. Ambulance staff are expected to strike again on Friday, and physiotherapists Thursday, making the week probably the most disruptive in NHS history, its Medical Director Stephen Powis said.However, unions say emergency care and cancer treatment will not be disrupted despite the walkout. The ambulance service also vowed to respond to the most urgent calls during their one-day strike.Business Secretary Grant Shapps said the paramedic strike could put lives at risk, by creating what he described as a ""postcode lottery when it comes to having a heart attack or a stroke.""The UK reported inflation of 10.5% in December last year, maintaining a nearly 40-year-all-time-high. While inflation is putting pressure on several public workers, the Conservative government argues that raising salaries with the rate unions are demanding would stand in the way of bringing inflation down.Throughout the past year, strikes have persisted and expanded among various different public sectors, ranging from teachers to bus and train drivers, airport workers, border staff and postal workers.Last month, the government of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak proposed a controversial bill, dubbed ""anti-strike bill"" by the media. The bill sets ""minimum safety levels"" that must be maintained during strikes within certain professions, in a way that complicates the process of walkouts.rmt/rt (AFP, AP)",2023/2/6,,

Georgian officials say he is feigning the gravity of his condition to secure an early release.Saakashvilli served two terms as Georgia's president between 2004 and 2013 and led the so-called Rose Revolution anti-government protests that first swept him to power.He then went into exile after giving up power. In 2018, he was convicted twice in absentia in cases that included abuse of power and sentenced to six years in prison.In 2021, the pro-Western leader made a surprise return to Georgia, ahead of nationwide municipal elections. He was arrested shortly after and went on hunger strikes to protest against his imprisonment.rm/rt (Reuters, AFP)",2023/2/6,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802379,"Audio, video related to stabbing suspect shooting released","HUNTINGTON PARK, Calif. (AP) — Authorities released audio and video Monday related to last month's fatal police shooting of a stabbing suspect near Los Angeles, while the man who was stabbed said the attack was random and that he initially thought he'd only been punched before realizing he was bleeding.

            The stabbing victim was interviewed by Fox 11 in a hospital room where he was continuing his recovery following the Jan. 26 attack by a man using a wheelchair in the city of Huntington Park.

            The Huntington Park Police Department released 911 calls related to the stabbing along with surveillance video of the moments before responding officers opened fire on the suspect who they said had threatened them with a large knife. The suspect, later identified as Anthony Lowe, was shot in the upper torso and died at the scene.











            Police Chief Cosme Lozano said his agency is cooperating with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, which is leading the investigation into the shooting. 

            “I emphasize that by releasing the video and audio recordings, it is with the goal of advancing full disclosure and transparency of the events that transpired from beginning to end,” Lozano said during a news conference. 

            The victim, a warehouse worker and father of four, asked that he only be identified by his first name, Ramiro, the news station said.

            Ramiro described a random attack on a sidewalk in which, for a moment, he believed he had only been punched and then realized his wound was far worse. Ramiro said he was crossing a street when he spotted a man with both legs amputated at the knees get off his wheelchair. Ramiro said the man asked him if he was alright.

            “I turn and look him, and I go, ‘Yes,’” Ramiro said. “And at that time, he just punched me.”

            Ramiro said he hadn’t initially spotted the knife but then saw blood gushing out of his armpit.

            Surveillance video of the stabbing appears to support the victim’s accounts that he made in a 911 call and then to Fox 11. It shows Ramiro walking past a gas station when he is approached by a man with both legs amputated at the knees. The man strikes Ramiro in the side and then scrambles away.

            When responding officers approached the suspect minutes later, he pulled out a foot-long (30 cm) knife and tried to throw it at them, according to a sheriff’s department statement. 

            The officers used a stun gun on him, and the man again tried to throw the knife, “at which time an officer-involved shooting occurred,” the statement said. 

            In the surveillance video, which has no audio, an officer overturns the wheelchair that the man had gotten back into, and he tumbles to the sidewalk. He leaves the wheelchair behind and scrambles along the sidewalk followed by three officers with their guns drawn. He turns toward the officers and briefly raises the knife before they open fire and he collapses.

            The time between the stabbing and the shooting by officers was approximately 7 minutes, Lozano said. Huntington Park officers do not use body cameras, the chief said. 

            The officers involved in the shooting were placed on administrative leave during the investigation. 

            Ramiro said the knife had punctured and collapsed his lung, but doctors were concerned that it may have also struck his heart.

            Fox 11 reported that Ramiro said he feels sorry for the stabbing suspect’s family but does not have compassion for the suspect.

            “I’m the victim,"" he said. “Why should I feel compassion to someone that does that sort of thing?”

            Lowe’s family and community activists held a news conference last week demanding the officers who killed him be prosecuted. At another news conference Monday, attorneys for Lowe's relatives questioned the officers' decision to open fire. 

            “Surely, there were non-deadly options. He was going nowhere,” attorney Eric Dubin said.

            Lowe’s older sister, Yatoya Toy, said last week that Anthony's legs were amputated last year after an altercation with law enforcement in Texas, the Los Angeles Times reported. The family, she said, also has questions about that incident.

(AP) — Authorities released audio and video Monday related to last month's fatal police shooting of a stabbing suspect near Los Angeles, while the man who was stabbed said the attack was random and that he initially thought he'd only been punched before realizing he was bleeding.The stabbing victim was interviewed by Fox 11 in a hospital room where he was continuing his recovery following the Jan. 26 attack by a man using a wheelchair in the city of Huntington Park.The Huntington Park Police Department released 911 calls related to the stabbing along with surveillance video of the moments before responding officers opened fire on the suspect who they said had threatened them with a large knife. The suspect, later identified as Anthony Lowe, was shot in the upper torso and died at the scene.Police Chief Cosme Lozano said his agency is cooperating with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, which is leading the investigation into the shooting.“I emphasize that by releasing the video and audio recordings, it is with the goal of advancing full disclosure and transparency of the events that transpired from beginning to end,” Lozano said during a news conference.The victim, a warehouse worker and father of four, asked that he only be identified by his first name, Ramiro, the news station said.Ramiro described a random attack on a sidewalk in which, for a moment, he believed he had only been punched and then realized his wound was far worse. Ramiro said he was crossing a street when he spotted a man with both legs amputated at the knees get off his wheelchair. Ramiro said the man asked him if he was alright.“I turn and look him, and I go, ‘Yes,’” Ramiro said. “And at that time, he just punched me.”Ramiro said he hadn’t initially spotted the knife but then saw blood gushing out of his armpit.Surveillance video of the stabbing appears to support the victim’s accounts that he made in a 911 call and then to Fox 11.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802380,Kentucky's Craft faces pushback on drug-related campaign ad,"FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) — Facing an early test in her bid to become Kentucky's next governor, Republican Kelly Craft is trying to navigate turbulence caused by one of her first ads, which aimed at connecting the wealthy ex-diplomat with voters by highlighting the state's heart-aching struggles with drug addiction.

            In a recent TV commercial, Craft said the fight against drug abuse is personal, confiding she's experienced “that empty chair at my table.” The former United Nations ambassador — seen as a top-tier candidate in a large GOP field — didn't disclose personal details in the widely aired ad. As questions swirled about its meaning, Craft told Kentucky Health News that she had a “close family member” who went to rehab and “was able to overcome the addiction and move on with their life.”

            The details stirred backlash from some Kentuckians who viewed the ad as insensitive because they first interpreted the “empty chair” reference to being about someone who died. Some of the most pointed criticism has come from people whose loved ones lost their lives to addiction.











            The blow-back has garnered considerable attention in a race being closely watched to see if popular incumbent Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear can overcome his party’s weak standing in Kentucky. Beshear is seeking re-election in the GOP-trending Bluegrass State.

            A group of grieving mothers showed up at a Craft campaign appearance last week, hoping to confront her about the ad and press for details about how she'd curb drug addiction if elected. They were blocked from attending, WLEX-TV reported. A campaign staffer collected contact information from the group, in case they might speak to Craft another time.

            Craft can “set a good example"" by meeting with such groups, since it's understandable that some people have questions about the ad, said Scott Jennings, a Kentucky-based Republican political commentator who once served as an adviser to former President George W. Bush.

            “Kelly could show some leadership skills here by having the guts to meet with people who are upset with her,” Jennings said.

            Her campaign didn’t immediately respond to an email from The Associated Press seeking additional comments. 

            As the matter has festered, a Lexington Herald-Leader columnist wrote that Craft either was getting bad advice or misunderstands “the ‘empty chair’ mess she’s in right now.”

            Craft — among a dozen GOP candidates competing in the state's May primary — entered the governor's race with an overwhelming money advantage. She's set a fast pace in raising and spending campaign cash, and can tap into her family's enormous wealth to bankroll her campaign.

            She got a head start on competitors with TV ads meant to raise her name recognition and take a stand to fight the seemingly intractable drug abuse problem. Fatal drug overdoses rose nearly 15% in Kentucky in 2021 and surpassed 2,000 deaths, the state said last year.

            Instead of backing off as pushback against the ad mounted, Craft's campaign has pressed ahead with messaging on the drug issue. She has said an empty chair can mean many things. 

            In a recent follow-up video, the wife of Craft's running mate explained what an “empty seat at the table” has meant for her family.

            “I firmly believe that means different things for different families,” Heather Wise, the wife of GOP state Sen. Max Wise, said as she spoke about how addiction has “ravaged” her family.

            An empty seat can mean the absence of loved ones in rehab or in jail due to addiction, she said. She said she also lost close family members to addiction.

            ""Not every family has had the worst-case scenario –- that permanent empty seat at their table that we have experienced,” she said.

            As part of her anti-drug theme, Craft has tried connecting Beshear to President Joe Biden’s immigration policies on the nation’s southern border. She blames those policies for contributing to an influx of illegal drugs to Kentucky.

            Beshear responded that a “strong national security requires strong border security,” and said Kentucky has done its part during his term. He noted that hundreds of Kentucky National Guard soldiers have deployed to the nation’s southwest border during his tenure and that a Kentucky guard member died as part of the mission.

            “For somebody wanting to be governor to talk about the border and to not mention the sacrifice and heroic service of our National Guard, and recognize their loss, I think is disrespectful and disqualifying,” the governor said.

            The back-and-forth enables Craft to portray herself to GOP voters as a fighter, Jennings said.

            “That’s what this entire primary is missing so far – someone explaining why they are the best person to defeat Beshear, and how they plan to do it,” Jennings said.

            Other GOP contenders for governor include Attorney General Daniel Cameron, state Agriculture Commissioner Ryan Quarles, state Auditor Mike Harmon and Somerset Mayor Alan Keck.FRANKFORT, Ky.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802381,Stanley Cup champion Avalanche steadily returning to health,"ENGLEWOOD, Colo. (AP) — Had his coach been watching, this might have made for an anxious moment: Colorado Avalanche defenseman Cale Makar catching an edge and falling in the fastest skater contest.

            Jared Bednar wasn’t tuned in, though, and had no idea what happened in the skills contest over All-Star weekend. Only that Makar emerged from his crash into the boards just fine.

            These days, things are definitely looking up for the Stanley Cup champions on the injury front. Defenseman Bowen Byram returns to the lineup, along with forward Valeri Nichushkin. Defenseman Josh Manson is creeping closer to a return. Same for captain Gabriel Landeskog, who’s yet to play this season. Forward Darren Helm is progressing, too.











            In spite of all their bumps and bruises, the Avalanche entered the All-Star break in a playoff spot. To weather the injury storm, Colorado has relied on 39 different skaters this season, a mark that's tied for the most in a single season since the team relocated to Denver in 1995. 

            “Anybody we can get back right now is huge,” said Makar, whose team kicks off a three-game trip Tuesday night in Pittsburgh.

            Byram returns after being sidelined with a lower-body injury since early November. He was an integral part of their Stanley Cup run a season ago, when he led all rookies with nine assists in the postseason. Byram was off to a fast start this season — two goals and three assists in 10 games — before his injury.

            “He’s looking great. He’s buzzing out there,” Makar said of his fellow blue liner. “Hopefully it doesn’t take him too long to get back into game mode. But I think he’s a guy that can turn it on pretty quickly.”

            Byram missed a chunk of games last season as he dealt with concussion symptoms. This time, he was able to be around the team as he worked his way back.

            “I was just happy it wasn’t my head,” Byram said. “It was a lot easier to be out when you’re still feeling good and feel like yourself. ... I’m just excited to get going again.""

            Count on Byram for as many minutes as necessary, too. 

            “I’m 100%, so no reason to ease into it,” Byram said. “I’m confident with jumping back in.”

            Manson will join the Avalanche on the trip so he can skate with the squad. He’s been out with a lower-body injury since the start of December.

            “I do think it helps to get on the road, be around the guys,” Bednar said.

            Landeskog could be back “fairly soon,” Bednar said, but didn't have a definitive timeline quite yet. The longtime Avalanche captain has been sidelined since knee surgery in October. 

            The Avalanche entered the All-Star break on quite a roll, winning seven of their last eight. They've amassed 57 points, which trails Dallas (66 points at the All-Star break), Winnipeg (65) and Minnesota (58) in the Central Division. 

            One thing the Avalanche are guarding against is another slow start out off the break. It happened over Christmas when the team had a few days off and promptly went 0-4-1 upon their return.

            “It’s just shifting the mentality back to game mode. No more vacation,"" Makar said. “We still have a long way to go. We're not where we want to be right now. But there's a lot of time left.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802382,Britcoin? UK gets closer to launching a digital currency,"LONDON (AP) — Britcoin is moving closer to reality.

            U.K. authorities on Monday said British businesses and consumers are likely to need a digital version of the pound, formally asking for public comment on the idea of introducing a central bank digital currency.

            Britain, home to the world’s second-biggest financial center, is trailing former colonies such as Nigeria, the Bahamas and Jamaica in rolling out a digital currency. More than 80% of the world’s central banks are considering launching digital currencies or have already done so, according to the consultant PwC.











            “While cash is here to stay, a digital pound issued and backed by the Bank of England could be a new way to pay that’s trusted, accessible and easy to use,” Treasury chief Jeremy Hunt said in a statement. “That’s why we want to investigate what is possible first, whilst always making sure we protect financial stability.”

            The call for public input comes almost two years after the Treasury and Bank of England said they were considering introducing a digital currency. 

            While Prime Minister Rishi Sunak suggested naming the initiative “Britcoin” when he was Treasury chief, the Bank of England has stressed that the potential currency shouldn’t be confused with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

            Backed by the central bank, the new currency would be “reliable and retain its value over time,” in contrast to cryptocurrencies that can fluctuate wildly and threaten the holdings of investors, the Bank of England says on its website.

            That industry has been particularly unstable in recent months, escalating calls for greater regulation. Crypto crashes last year tanked assets, while crypto exchange FTX's multibillion-dollar collapse and bankruptcy in November triggered fraud charges against founder Sam Bankman-Fried.

            The proposed digital currency would be denominated in pounds, with 10 pounds of digital currency always equal to a 10-pound note, the bank said. Held in a digital wallet, the currency could be used to pay for goods and services electronically.

            Supporters of central bank digital currencies say they make digital transactions easier and cheaper and expand access to the financial system because they can be used by people who don’t have bank accounts.

            This is one of the reasons the Bahamas became the first country to introduce a digital currency in 2020. Nigeria and Jamaica have since followed suit, with China and more than 20 other countries running trial projects. The U.S. and European Union are considering introducing digital currencies.

            But digital currencies also present risks, including cyberattacks, privacy concerns and the danger that they can be used by criminals. 

            Because money invested in central bank digital currencies is safer than a bank deposit, they also may draw savings away from commercial banks and weaken the financial system, critics argue.

            A digital pound would have “risks but no obvious benefits,” former Bank of England Gov. Mervyn King, now a member of the House of Lords, said recently.

            While such digital currencies may be useful in countries that don’t have effective banking systems, that’s not the case in the Britain, he said.

            “The government has said that it wants the U.K. to be at the forefront of innovation, crypto-assets and fintech, but we need to be selective and not driven by a misplaced enthusiasm for all things crypto,” King said.LONDON (AP) — Britcoin is moving closer to reality.U.K. authorities on Monday said British businesses and consumers are likely to need a digital version of the pound, formally asking for public comment on the idea of introducing a central bank digital currency.Britain, home to the world’s second-biggest financial center, is trailing former colonies such as Nigeria, the Bahamas and Jamaica in rolling out a digital currency.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802383,Arkansas House passes bill restricting 'adult' performances,"LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) — The Arkansas House voted Monday to restrict “adult-oriented"" performances, revamping a measure that previously targeted drag shows following discrimination complaints from the LGBTQ community.

            The bill approved by the majority-Republican House on a 78-15 vote no longer explicitly adds drag shows to the list of businesses considered “adult-oriented,"" easing some of the concerns of LGBTQ advocates and other opponents. The bill now heads back to the majority-Republican Senate, which approved an earlier version of the restriction.

            “This bill is not about whether drag is acceptable,"" Republican Rep. Mary Bentley, the bill's sponsor, told House members before the vote. “It’s about whether we should be exposing our children to sexually explicit behavior.""











            Arkansas is one of several states where Republican lawmakers have proposed restrictions on drag shows, which have been targeted by right-wing activists and politicians in recent months. Protesters have appeared at events like drag story hours, in which colorfully clad drag queens read books to children. Opponents of such events have claimed they're harmful to children.

            Under the current version of Arkansas' bill, the restricted performances would include performers who are nude or seminude, and purposely exposing a specific anatomical area, or prosthetic breasts or genitalia. To meet the definition, the performance must feature real or simulated sexual activities and be intended to appeal to “prurient"" interests, a term that's not defined in the legislation.

            The performances would be banned from public property, from being paid for with public funds and from allowing minors to attend.

            The original version of the legislation would have classified drag shows as adult-oriented businesses, the same category as adult theaters and strip clubs, which would have banned them from being with 1,000 feet of public schools, churches and libraries.

            The top Democrat in the House said that, even with the changes, the bill was too vaguely worded and worried about how far it could end up being interpreted.

            “I think if people are going to get penalized for doing something, they should understand what the parameters are of that and what the definitions are,"" Rep. Tippi McCullough, the House minority leader, said.

            A spokeswoman for Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders last week said the Republican supported the amended version of the legislation.

            Opponents of the legislation said the amended version is an improvement over the original proposal that specifically targeted drag shows. That proposal prompted worries that it could restrict other performances where actors or actresses portray someone of the opposite sex, and would even restrict transgender people's activities.

            “This takes down our temperature and our concern about the bill quite significantly,"" said Sarah Warbelow, legal director of the Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest LGBTQ civil rights group. But Warbelow said she doesn't think the law is necessary, given existing laws addressing performances that are inappropriate for minors.

            The American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas called the changes “progress,"" but said the bill still poses constitutional concerns since it could prevent some artists from performing in public places.

            “Violating the First Amendment rights of all people is not an acceptable proposal to substitute for the targeting of some Arkansans,"" the group said in a statement released on its website last week.LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) — The Arkansas House voted Monday to restrict “adult-oriented"" performances, revamping a measure that previously targeted drag shows following discrimination complaints from the LGBTQ community.The bill approved by the majority-Republican House on a 78-15 vote no longer explicitly adds drag shows to the list of businesses considered “adult-oriented,"" easing some of the concerns of LGBTQ advocates and other opponents. The bill now heads back to the majority-Republican Senate, which approved an earlier version of the restriction.“This bill is not about whether drag is acceptable,"" Republican Rep. Mary Bentley, the bill's sponsor, told House members before the vote. “It’s about whether we should be exposing our children to sexually explicit behavior.""Arkansas is one of several states where Republican lawmakers have proposed restrictions on drag shows, which have been targeted by right-wing activists and politicians in recent months. Protesters have appeared at events like drag story hours, in which colorfully clad drag queens read books to children. Opponents of such events have claimed they're harmful to children.Under the current version of Arkansas' bill, the restricted performances would include performers who are nude or seminude, and purposely exposing a specific anatomical area, or prosthetic breasts or genitalia. To meet the definition, the performance must feature real or simulated sexual activities and be intended to appeal to “prurient"" interests, a term that's not defined in the legislation.The performances would be banned from public property, from being paid for with public funds and from allowing minors to attend.The original version of the legislation would have classified drag shows as adult-oriented businesses, the same category as adult theaters and strip clubs, which would have banned them from being with 1,000 feet of public schools, churches and libraries.The top Democrat in the House said that, even with the changes, the bill was too vaguely worded and worried about how far it could end up being interpreted.“I think if people are going to get penalized for doing something, they should understand what the parameters are of that and what the definitions are,"" Rep. Tippi McCullough, the House minority leader, said.A spokeswoman for Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders last week said the Republican supported the amended version of the legislation.Opponents of the legislation said the amended version is an improvement over the original proposal that specifically targeted drag shows. That proposal prompted worries that it could restrict other performances where actors or actresses portray someone of the opposite sex, and would even restrict transgender people's activities.“This takes down our temperature and our concern about the bill quite significantly,"" said Sarah Warbelow, legal director of the Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest LGBTQ civil rights group.

For consumers of color in particular, the stepped-up security measures risk alienating a population that already feels overpoliced.

            LONDON (AP) — Automakers Renault and Nissan on Monday formalized their reboot of a relationship that had grown rocky. Under the decision announced Monday, both companies will own 15% in the other. Up to now, Renault Group of France owned 43.4% of Nissan, while Japanese automaker Nissan Motor Co. owned 15% of Renault. The uneven shareholdings had been viewed at times as a source of conflict. In an interview with AP in London, Renault Chairman Jean Dominique Senard highlighted the French company’s push into electric vehicles and said the spectacular fall of top executive Carlos Ghosn is “in the past.” Ghosn led successful turnarounds at both companies before his arrest on financial misconduct charges and daring escape.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802393,Sean Payton brings old-school style to Denver in his return,"ENGLEWOOD, Colo. (AP) — Sean Payton is bringing an old-school style sown by his mentor Bill Parcells and steeped in discipline and accountability as he takes over as the Denver Broncos' new head coach.

            One thing that means is that Russell Wilson will no longer have his own entourage at the team's headquarters as he did this past season.

            Payton was introduced as the franchise's 20th head coach Monday and he was asked in an informal gathering with reporters afterward about Wilson's personal QB coach being on the premises in 2022, when Wilson suffered through the worst statistical season of his career.











            “Yeah, that's foreign to me,"" Payton said. ""That's not going to take place here. I mean, I'm unfamiliar with it. But our staff will be here, our players will be here and that'll be that.”

            Members of Wilson's support team having access to the building was one of many perks allowed the quarterback last season by general manager George Payton and rookie head coach Nathaniel Hackett, who was fired Dec. 26. 

            Given Payton's stance on that matter, Wilson might also have to surrender his extra parking spaces and private upstairs office. 

            We also could see less of his globetrotting jaunts on social media and maybe his teammates will have to make do without the air hockey and gaming chairs that were part of Hackett's conversion of the reporters' workroom into a splashy players arcade a year ago.

            The new head coach is all business, concerned not with creature comforts but about changing a losing culture that has permeated the franchise.

            The Broncos surrendered their first-round pick, No. 29 overall, in the upcoming draft to the New Orleans Saints in order to sign Payton to a five-year deal worth around $18 million a year. 

            Payton has some unfinished business at his old job in broadcasting before diving into the task of turning around a franchise that has floundered under first-time head coaches Vance Joseph, Vic Fangio and Hackett during a seven-year playoff drought.

            Payton said he'll work the Super Bowl between the Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs in his final week as an analyst on Fox NFL Kickoff.

            “I'm picking the Eagles,” Payton said. “We never want anyone in our division to win anything, right?”

            Payton made a point of not piling on the former regime, but he did have this to say when asked about his game management skills: ""I don't anticipate the crowd having to count down the 30-second clock"" as it did in Hackett's home debut.

            Fans mocking counting down the seconds led Paton to lure longtime assistant Jerry Rosburg out of retirement to handle those duties for Hackett, who also gave up play-calling duties later in the season. 

            Rosburg coached the final two games after Hackett's dismissal when Wilson finally played like the nine-time Pro Bowler he is, something Payton mentioned Monday when asked about helping Wilson bounce back in 2023.

            “I think the No. 1 job for us as coaches in evaluating our players is what are the things that they do really well and then let’s try to put them in those positions. At least that’s a starting point, and I think it's important to highlight their strengths and minimize any weaknesses,"" Payton said.

            “None of us want to be at a karaoke bar with a song we don't know the words to,"" Payton said. ""So, how do we get them comfortable and highlight their strengths? And that's the process that's going to begin right now as I'm learning about every one of these players, not just Russell.""

            Payton invoked Parcells' “law and order” mantra when talking about his coaching philosophies. 

            “You come in with your standards but you're not coming in indicting anyone else's,” Payton said. “... You really knock the rearview mirror off the automobile. We're just looking forward.”

            Payton went 161-97, including playoffs, in 15 seasons in New Orleans before stepping down last year when Drew Brees retired. He took over a moribund Saints team that had gone 3-13 in 2005 and led them to a 10-6 record and an appearance in the NFC championship game in his first season with the Saints.

            As to whether a similar turnaround can be expected in Denver, Payton said, “I think it’s realistic for our fanbase to expect a completely different type of culture. And I think it’s realistic for them to expect us to win.”

            To what degree, who knows?

            “I know this: the work has started,” Payton said. “I kind of use this term, you know, a little bit more anonymous donors this season. Just know that we're working. But a little bit less visibility on social media and all those other things. We're going to get to work. And ultimately, it’s how we do in the fall.”

            CEO and co-owner Greg Penner, who led the Broncos' head coaching search that included eight candidates, said when he asked around the league about Payton, attention to detail was one attribute that kept coming up.

            To that end, Payton, who also interviewed for the openings with the Texans, Panthers and Cardinals, acknowledged that his wearing an orange tie on television recently was by design.

            “Like this pocket tissue I’m wearing right now has an angle going upwards if you can see it,"" Payton said. ""And so this morning when I put it on, that’s kind of symbolic about the direction we’re heading.”

But our staff will be here, our players will be here and that'll be that.”Members of Wilson's support team having access to the building was one of many perks allowed the quarterback last season by general manager George Payton and rookie head coach Nathaniel Hackett, who was fired Dec. 26.Given Payton's stance on that matter, Wilson might also have to surrender his extra parking spaces and private upstairs office.We also could see less of his globetrotting jaunts on social media and maybe his teammates will have to make do without the air hockey and gaming chairs that were part of Hackett's conversion of the reporters' workroom into a splashy players arcade a year ago.The new head coach is all business, concerned not with creature comforts but about changing a losing culture that has permeated the franchise.The Broncos surrendered their first-round pick, No. 29 overall, in the upcoming draft to the New Orleans Saints in order to sign Payton to a five-year deal worth around $18 million a year.Payton has some unfinished business at his old job in broadcasting before diving into the task of turning around a franchise that has floundered under first-time head coaches Vance Joseph, Vic Fangio and Hackett during a seven-year playoff drought.Payton said he'll work the Super Bowl between the Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs in his final week as an analyst on Fox NFL Kickoff.“I'm picking the Eagles,” Payton said. “We never want anyone in our division to win anything, right?”Payton made a point of not piling on the former regime, but he did have this to say when asked about his game management skills: ""I don't anticipate the crowd having to count down the 30-second clock"" as it did in Hackett's home debut.Fans mocking counting down the seconds led Paton to lure longtime assistant Jerry Rosburg out of retirement to handle those duties for Hackett, who also gave up play-calling duties later in the season.Rosburg coached the final two games after Hackett's dismissal when Wilson finally played like the nine-time Pro Bowler he is, something Payton mentioned Monday when asked about helping Wilson bounce back in 2023.“I think the No. 1 job for us as coaches in evaluating our players is what are the things that they do really well and then let’s try to put them in those positions. At least that’s a starting point, and I think it's important to highlight their strengths and minimize any weaknesses,"" Payton said.“None of us want to be at a karaoke bar with a song we don't know the words to,"" Payton said. ""So, how do we get them comfortable and highlight their strengths? And that's the process that's going to begin right now as I'm learning about every one of these players, not just Russell.""Payton invoked Parcells' “law and order” mantra when talking about his coaching philosophies.“You come in with your standards but you're not coming in indicting anyone else's,” Payton said. “... You really knock the rearview mirror off the automobile. We're just looking forward.”Payton went 161-97, including playoffs, in 15 seasons in New Orleans before stepping down last year when Drew Brees retired. He took over a moribund Saints team that had gone 3-13 in 2005 and led them to a 10-6 record and an appearance in the NFC championship game in his first season with the Saints.As to whether a similar turnaround can be expected in Denver, Payton said, “I think it’s realistic for our fanbase to expect a completely different type of culture. And I think it’s realistic for them to expect us to win.”To what degree, who knows?“I know this: the work has started,” Payton said. “I kind of use this term, you know, a little bit more anonymous donors this season. Just know that we're working. But a little bit less visibility on social media and all those other things. We're going to get to work. And ultimately, it’s how we do in the fall.”CEO and co-owner Greg Penner, who led the Broncos' head coaching search that included eight candidates, said when he asked around the league about Payton, attention to detail was one attribute that kept coming up.To that end, Payton, who also interviewed for the openings with the Texans, Panthers and Cardinals, acknowledged that his wearing an orange tie on television recently was by design.“Like this pocket tissue I’m wearing right now has an angle going upwards if you can see it,"" Payton said. ""And so this morning when I put it on, that’s kind of symbolic about the direction we’re heading.”___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/2/7,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802394,"NJ charges Paterson officer who shot, wounded fleeing person","TRENTON, N.J. (AP) — New Jersey's top law enforcement official brought criminal charges Monday against a police officer he said shot a fleeing person in the back, wounding him severely. 

            Attorney General Matthew Platkin said the state filed charges of second-degree aggravated assault and official misconduct against Paterson Police Officer Jerry Moravek. 

            The charges stem from a June 2022 incident in which Moravek saw the victim, who is not identified in the charging documents, run past him soon after hearing gunshots. Moravek shouted for the person to drop the gun before firing, striking him in the back. 











            Platkin said the person did not have a gun in his possession or within reach. A firearm was found near the site of the shooting, according to the charging document, but Platkin said there was no DNA or fingerprint evidence linking it to the man.

            ""We have promised to never be complacent and we have made a commitment to stand up against unnecessary and excessive uses of force by those with a duty to protect the public,"" Platkin said. 

            Moravek's attorney, Patrick Caserta, said in a statement that his client had been falsely accused. He said the officer had a duty to pursue the person he thought had fired shots. 

            “During a short foot chase, there came a time when Officer Moravek believed his life and the life of other people in the street was at risk. He believed at that split-second that the person he was chasing was turning to fire that handgun at him and he realized that if he missed, the bullets could strike anyone nearby,” the statement read. 

            Moravek made repeated calls for an ambulance afterward, Caserta added. 

            Video released from the incident shows Moravek asking the person he shot why he ran from him. 

            “I was scared. I don't have no gun, though” he said. 

            Platkin said the officer didn't give the person he shot a warning that he was going to fire or order him to stop running or get down on the ground. 

            The shooting left bullet fragments in the person's spine, Platkin said. He has not been able to walk since, according to the charging document. 

            Paterson Mayor Andre Sayegh said in a statement that a preliminary review found that Moravek followed guidelines while responding to a service call and after hearing gunshots fired. The mayor, a Democrat, cited the pending legal process and said he wouldn't comment further. 

            The charges come as New Jersey has sought to increase scrutiny of police officers involved in shootings. In late 2020, Platkin's predecessor issued new use-of-force rules barring physical force against civilians except as a last resort, among other requirements. 

            In 2019, New Jersey Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy signed a measure requiring the state attorney general to conduct investigations when police fatally shoot someone. 

            Platkin, a Murphy appointee, said Monday's charges don't stem from that law and presenting the case to a grand jury isn't required, but his office “will not hesitate” to do so in cases like this one.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802395,Rindahl named permanent head coach at Wisconsin-Whitewater,"WHITEWATER, Wis. (AP) — Wisconsin-Whitewater has removed the interim tag from Jace Rindahl’s title and made him the permanent replacement for retired coach Kevin Bullis.

            Rindahl had spent the last eight seasons as an assistant coach at the Division III program. When Bullis announced in November that he was stepping down, Wisconsin-Whitewater named Rindahl the interim head coach and said it would conduct a national search for Bullis’ replacement.

            School officials announced Monday they had decided on Rindahl to fill that role.











            “I know there is great responsibility that comes with this role,” Rindahl said in a statement. “As a former student-athlete and assistant coach, I feel my time in this program has helped prepare me for this opportunity and I am ready to serve our football team, athletic department, university and community.”

            Rindahl started as Wisconsin-Whitewater’s linebackers coach in 2015 and took over as defensive coordinator in 2020. He was promoted to assistant head coach before last season.

            The former linebacker played at Wisconsin-Whitewater from 2005-08 and was part of its 2007 Division III national championship team.

            Bullis posted a 78-13 record in seven seasons, including a Division III runner-up finish in 2019 and semifinal appearances in 2015, 2018 and 2021. The Warhawks went 8-3 last season and lost 33-28 to Aurora in the first round of the playoffs.

            
                Wisconsin-Whitewater won national titles in 2007, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2013 and 2014 under Lance Leipold, now the coach at Kansas.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802396,"AP source: Suns president, CEO Jason Rowley leaves team","PHOENIX (AP) — Phoenix Suns president and CEO Jason Rowley has decided to leave the team as the franchise moves forward with leadership changes, according to a person familiar with the details.

            The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because Rowley’s resignation was not shared outside of the organization.

            The person said Rowley's departure was “shared internally” within the Suns organization on Monday. ESPN first reported the news, saying employees were notified in an internal email from Suns interim governor Sam Garvin.











            Rowley's resignation comes in the midst of big changes in Phoenix. Mortgage executive Mat Ishbia is expected to be the team's new majority owner in the near future if the NBA's board of governors approves his plan to purchase the controlling stake of the Suns and WNBA's Phoenix Mercury from embattled owner Robert Sarver. 

            The 43-year-old Ishbia agreed on Dec. 20 to the deal, one that put the total value of the Suns and Mercury at $4 billion.

            The NBA suspended Sarver in September for one year, plus fined him $10 million, after an investigation found he had engaged in what the league called “workplace misconduct and organizational deficiencies.”

            Sarver’s suspension came nearly a year after the NBA asked a law firm to investigate allegations that Sarver had a history of racist, misogynistic and hostile incidents over his nearly two-decade tenure overseeing the franchise.

            Shortly afterward, Sarver announced he would be looking to sell the Suns and the Mercury.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802399,NYC ending COVID-19 vaccination mandate for city employees,"NEW YORK (AP) — New York City, which once had the nation’s strictest workplace vaccination rules for COVID-19, is ending one of its last such mandates, saying it will no longer require the shots for municipal employees including police officers, firefighters and teachers.

            The vaccine mandate, which led to the firing of hundreds of city workers who declined to get the shots, will end Friday, Mayor Eric Adams announced Monday.

            Adams, a Democrat, said that with more than 96% of city employees and more than 80% of city residents having received their initial vaccine series, “this is the right moment for this decision.”











            City Health Commissioner Dr. Ashwin Vasan said, “It’s clear these mandates saved lives and were absolutely necessary to meet the moment. We’re grateful that we can now, as we leave the emergency phase of the pandemic, modify more of the rules that have gotten us to this point.""

            The vaccination mandate for city employees was one of the last COVID-19 measures still in place in New York City. The city ended its vaccine requirement for employees of private businesses in November 2022, and masks are now optional in most public spaces including subways and buses.

            New York City's private-sector mandate forced All-Star point guard and vaccine skeptic Kyrie Irving to miss most of the Brooklyn Nets home games last season. 

            Irving will no longer be affected by any changes in New York City's coronavirus policies. The Nets and the Dallas Mavericks announced a deal Monday that will send Irving to Dallas.

            New York City's municipal work force of about 337,000 was one of the largest groups of government employees in the United States to be affected by a COVID-19 vaccine mandate.

            The vaccine requirement for the 1.3 million-strong U.S. military was lifted in December under an $858 billion defense spending bill passed by Congress and signed into law by President Joe Biden.

            The approximately 1,780 New York City workers who have been terminated for failing to comply with the municipal employee vaccination requirement will not get their jobs back automatically but can apply for positions with their former agencies, city officials said.

            Unions representing some of the fired workers planned a news conference later Monday to demand their reinstatement with back pay.NEW YORK (AP) — New York City, which once had the nation’s strictest workplace vaccination rules for COVID-19, is ending one of its last such mandates, saying it will no longer require the shots for municipal employees including police officers, firefighters and teachers.The vaccine mandate, which led to the firing of hundreds of city workers who declined to get the shots, will end Friday, Mayor Eric Adams announced Monday.Adams, a Democrat, said that with more than 96% of city employees and more than 80% of city residents having received their initial vaccine series, “this is the right moment for this decision.”City Health Commissioner Dr. Ashwin Vasan said, “It’s clear these mandates saved lives and were absolutely necessary to meet the moment.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802400,Irving trade official as Mavs essentially start season over,"DALLAS (AP) — Luka Doncic has his co-star, and the Dallas Mavericks are set for their season essentially to start over after trading for Kyrie Irving.

            
                The blockbuster deal with Brooklyn sending the mercurial Irving to the Mavericks became official Monday, two days before what figures to be his Dallas debut at the Los Angeles Clippers.

            Dallas also gets Markieff Morris in a trade that sent Spencer Dinwiddie, Dorian Finney-Smith, a 2029 first-round pick and two second-round choices to the Nets.











            It's unknown if Doncic will be available against the Clippers. He wasn't with the Mavs at the start of a five-game trip out West after bruising his right heel in the final home game before the trip. He was ruled out of the second game on the trip at Utah on Monday night.

            Whenever the All-Stars do get on the court together, Doncic and Irving instantly become one of the NBA's top duos in a tightly packed Western Conference. Mavs coach Jason Kidd said that made the opportunity too good to pass up, despite the distractions Irving has caused off the court.

            “To have the ability to have two starters that are going to start in the All-Star Game, for the Mavs, is probably a first,” Kidd said. “We have to be excited about this opportunity. It’s easy to look at all the talk of the negative, but let’s look at the positive of what he’s done on and off the court. That’s the way we approach it.”

            The Nets hardly even said goodbye, perhaps fed up from all the drama Irving caused in just 3½ seasons.

            Brooklyn's news release on the trade barely mentioned Irving, whereas the announcement last year that they had dealt James Harden to Philadelphia included a quote from general manager Sean Marks thanking the star guard for his contributions and wishing him well in the future.

            Irving’s departure was a far cry from the fanfare that followed his arrival along with Kevin Durant in 2019, when the player who was a Nets fan in New Jersey came home in hopes of leading the franchise to its first title.

            But they never got close, and when Irving asked to be traded, just like he once did in Cleveland, the Nets quickly accommodated him.

            Irving is set to become a free agent after the season. But negotiations will involve Dallas general manager Nico Harrison, who was a Nike executive before taking over the Mavericks in 2021.

            Irving had a relationship with Nike for the entirety of his NBA career until earlier this season, when the sneaker giant dropped him and canceled the planned release of his next signature shoe just before it dropped. It was part of the massive fallout from Irving posting a link to an antisemitic film on his Twitter account.

            That was one of many drama-filled sagas that marked Irving’s time with the Nets. He wouldn’t get vaccinated against COVID-19 and, because of New York City workplace rules, had to miss most of Brooklyn’s home games last season. He also took two leaves of absence during the 2020-21 season.

            He has expressed no shortage of controversial opinions during his career — including repeated questioning whether the Earth was round before eventually apologizing to science teachers.

            Doncic is in a dead heat for the scoring lead with fellow MVP candidate Joel Embiid of Philadelphia, and is the only one of the seven current 30-point scorers also averaging at least eight rebounds and eight assists per game. Irving is averaging 27.1 points, 5.3 assists and 5.1 rebounds.

            The West has several title-contending teams beyond defending champion Golden State, which eliminated the Mavs in the conference finals last season.

            Jalen Brunson was crucial to Dallas’ playoff run alongside Doncic last season, but decided he wanted his own starting role as a point guard and left for the New York Knicks in free agency.

            While the Mavericks traded for a solid No. 2 scorer in Christian Wood in the offseason, they haven’t been able to win without Doncic this season.

            Dallas was 0-7 without Doncic going into the game against the Jazz, when Wood was expected to return after missing eight games with a fractured left thumb.

            A year ago, the Mavericks were right around .500 when their surge started just as the calendar turned to 2022. The arrival of 2023 hasn’t had the same effect — the high point so far is six games over .500 — but the Mavs hope the arrival of Irving will.

            Dallas beat Utah twice in the first three games of a first-round series last season when Doncic was out with a calf injury, and Brunson was the biggest reason. Now Doncic has higher-profile help.

            “Just being able to give Luka an opportunity to come down the court without having to dribble or run every play,” Kidd said. “We look back when we had (Brunson) and being able to have a playmaker like that. When you look at Ky, nothing against (Brunson), but Ky is at a different level.”

            AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsDALLAS (AP) — Luka Doncic has his co-star, and the Dallas Mavericks are set for their season essentially to start over after trading for Kyrie Irving.The blockbuster deal with Brooklyn sending the mercurial Irving to the Mavericks became official Monday, two days before what figures to be his Dallas debut at the Los Angeles Clippers.Dallas also gets Markieff Morris in a trade that sent Spencer Dinwiddie, Dorian Finney-Smith, a 2029 first-round pick and two second-round choices to the Nets.It's unknown if Doncic will be available against the Clippers. He wasn't with the Mavs at the start of a five-game trip out West after bruising his right heel in the final home game before the trip. He was ruled out of the second game on the trip at Utah on Monday night.Whenever the All-Stars do get on the court together, Doncic and Irving instantly become one of the NBA's top duos in a tightly packed Western Conference. Mavs coach Jason Kidd said that made the opportunity too good to pass up, despite the distractions Irving has caused off the court.“To have the ability to have two starters that are going to start in the All-Star Game, for the Mavs, is probably a first,” Kidd said. “We have to be excited about this opportunity.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802413,"Clash of Clans Introduced New Tricks during the Spring Festival, the ""Lunar Queen""Poppep Up on the Streets of Malaysia","KUALA LUMPUR, MALAYSIA -  Media OutReach - 7 February 2023 - Spring Festival is one of the most important traditional holidays in the Chinese-speaking region and the entire Asian region, and even among all Chinese people worldwide. During the Spring Festival of this year, a group of vehicles and food delivery bicycles bustled through the streets and lanes of Malaysia, wearing the new ""Rabbit costumes,"" which are actually the new year-limited skins of the mobile game Clash of Clans. Lunar Queen, the time-limited skin of the game, is meant to echo the Year of the Rabbit theme. Players who are familiar with this game may recall that Clash of Clans always introduced a slew of ""Spring Festival-limited"" content items in each lunar new year, bringing players lots of new year's wishes.   Limited content for the New Year of the Rabbit, as well as incredible gifts for players    In order to fit with the theme of the Year of the Rabbit, Clash of Clans launched two limited skins this Spring Festival: Lunar Queen, a cute and cool rabbit image, and the Magic Theatre, a village scenery inspired by traditional Chinese drama stages. Besides, the game also successively launched the Warrior Champion skins, decorations including the Rabbit Lantern and the Magic Show statue, as well as the customized Lunar New Year Challenge for the Year of the Rabbit. Players who logged in to the game during the Spring Festival can feel the strong atmosphere of the Lunar New Year holiday.            Moreover, Clash of Clans also showcased two New Year's publicity videos to let players know more about the game. The two videos adopted a new form of presentation, presenting the elements of the Spring Festival in a unique way, in addition to maintaining a consistently high level of production. It is evident from the players' feedback that they have a high degree of recognition for the two videos and the updated game contents.   Media and KOLs jointly support the online marketing of the game   The launching of the two publicity videos attracted lots of attention on the internet and social media in Malaysia. Many well-known game portals, such as Gamer Santai, Gamerbraves, Gamicsoft, and Gameclopedia, etc., recommended the publicity videos and the Lunar New Year-limited content of Clash of Clans on top of their homepages. Plenty of well-known Malaysian we-media outlets also posted to promote this game towards the audience after experiencing the new content and the specific challenge of Clash of Clans for the Year of the Rabbit.   On some social media platforms, such as Facebook, a dozen renowned Malaysian KOLs forwarded and recommended the Lunar New Year animation and Spring Festival publicity video of Clash of Clans. Watching the videos, the KOLs highly commented on the video content, recommended the game to their fans, and encouraged them to give it a try during Spring Festival as well.   More KOLs even started to play Clash of Clans live on social networks during the Spring Festival, demonstrating the newly launched hero skins, village scenery, and all the Easter Eggs in the game, to enjoy the Spring Festival atmosphere in this game together with the audience.            Clash of Clans popped up on the streets of Malaysia with overwhelming charm   Except for multi-dimensional online exposure, Clash of Clans also conducted brand-new offline marketing in Malaysia during the Spring Festival of the Rabbit Year. The game's new year-limited skins and event information appeared in the form of Grab vehicle body advertisements and Grab delivery box advertisements on the streets of Kuala Lumpur and Selangor. It is believed that Clash of Clans players would definitely feel the new year's wishes that the game brings when ""encountering"" these posters.            During the Spring Festival, it has become a Clash of Clans routine to launch a series of limited content and events, celebrate the special holiday, and enjoy the unique charm of the festival with players together. In this Spring Festival of the Rabbit Year, Clash of Clans also tried to explore new forms and new content of interaction with players step by step instead of only presenting game content.   The presence of Southeast Asia, a new attempt of Clash of Clans   As early as August last year, Supercell had started to cooperate with Xiaomi, a world-renowned mobile phone manufacturer, to celebrate the offline 10th anniversary party of Clash of Clans. Whether it is the online messaging activity initiated to recruit players or the final offline anniversary party, they have all received unanimous praise from local players in Malaysia.   Last November, the games Clash of Clans and Clash Royale, based on the Clash IP, witnessed the grand Clash Fest event. With the focus on game, community, and tournament, Supercell held the offline competition viewing activities of the two games in multiple cities globally. The offline competition viewing activities in many countries in Southeast Asia attracted lots of players to come on site in an intense atmosphere.   From the Clash of Clans 10th anniversary party to the offline competition viewing of Clash Fest to the multi-channel marketing of the game during the Spring Festival this year, Clash of Clans is repeatedly signaling its return to Southeast Asia and exploring new ways of interaction with players. Stay tuned for other following actions and surprises coming soon!  Hashtag: #ClashofClans

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802414,"Major earthquake kills 3,700 in Turkey and Syria, weather hits survivors","KAHRAMANMARAS, Turkey/DAMASCUS, Feb 6 (Reuters) - A huge earthquake killed more than 3,700 people across a swathe of Turkey and northwest Syria on Monday, with freezing winter weather adding to the plight of the thousands left injured or homeless and hampering efforts to find survivors.The magnitude 7.8 quake brought down whole apartment blocks in Turkish cities and piled more devastation on millions of Syrians displaced by years of war.It struck before sunrise in harsh weather and was followed in the early afternoon by another large quake.In Diyarbakir in southeast Turkey, a woman speaking next to the wreckage of the seven-storey block where she lived said: ""We were shaken like a cradle. There were nine of us at home. Two sons of mine are still in the rubble, I'm waiting for them.""She was nursing a broken arm and had injuries to her face.""It was like the apocalypse,"" said Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a Syrian in the northern town of Atareb. ""It's bitterly cold and there's heavy rain, and people need saving.""The earthquake was the biggest recorded worldwide by the U.S. Geological Survey since a tremor in the remote South Atlantic in August 2021.In Turkey, the death toll stood at 2,316, the Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD) said, making it the country's deadliest earthquake since a tremor of similar magnitude in 1999 devastated the heavily populated eastern Marmara Sea region near Istanbul, killing more than 17,000.At least 1,444 people were killed in Syria in Monday's quake and about 3,500 injured, according to figures from the Damascus government and rescue workers in the northwestern region controlled by insurgents.Poor internet connections and damaged roads between some of the worst-hit cities in Turkey's south, homes to millions of people, hindered efforts to assess and address the impact.Temperatures in some areas were expected to fall to near freezing overnight, worsening conditions for people trapped under rubble or left homeless. Rain fell on Monday after snowstorms swept the country at the weekend.More than 13,000 people were injured in Turkey from the quake.In the Turkish city of Iskenderun, rescuers climbed an enormous pile of debris that was once part of a state hospital's intensive care unit in search of survivors. Health workers did what they could to tend to the new rush of injured patients.""We have a patient who was taken into surgery but we don't know what happened,"" said Tulin, a woman in her 30s, standing outside the hospital, wiping away tears and praying.Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, preparing for a tough election in May, called the quake a historic disaster and the worst earthquake to hit the country since 1939, but said authorities were doing all they could.""Everyone is putting their heart and soul into efforts although the winter season, cold weather and the earthquake happening during the night makes things more difficult,"" he said.The second quake was big enough to bring down more buildings and, like the first, was felt across the region, endangering rescuers struggling to pull casualties from the rubble.In Syria, already wrecked by more than 11 years of civil war, the health ministry said 711 people had been killed. In the Syrian rebel-held northwest emergency workers said 733 people had died.The United Nations says 4.1 million people, many of them displaced by the conflict and living in camps, depend already on cross-border humanitarian aid in northwest Syria and international support efforts are stretched and underfunded.""Syrian communities are simultaneously hit with an ongoing cholera outbreak and harsh winter events including heavy rain and snow over the weekend,"" U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters in New York.In the government-controlled city of Aleppo, footage on Twitter showed two neighbouring buildings collapsing one after the other, filling streets with billowing dust.Two residents of the city, which has been heavily damaged in the war, said the buildings had fallen in the hours after the quake, which was felt as far away as Cyprus and Lebanon.In the Syrian government-held city of Hama, a Reuters journalist saw an apparently lifeless child carried from the ruins of a building.'NO ONE CAME OUT'In the rebel-held town of Jandaris in Aleppo province, a mound of concrete, steel rods and bundles of clothes lay where a multi-storey building once stood.""There were 12 families under there. Not a single one came out. Not one,"" said a thin young man, his eyes wide open in shock and his hand bandaged.Raed al-Saleh of the Syrian White Helmets, a rescue service in rebel-held territory known for pulling people from the ruins of buildings destroyed by air strikes, said they were in ""a race against time to save the lives of those under the rubble"".Syrian state television showed rescue teams searching for survivors in heavy rain and sleet. President Bashar al-Assad held an emergency cabinet meeting to review the damage and discuss next steps, his office said.In the Turkish city of Diyarbakir, Reuters journalists saw dozens of rescue workers searching through a mound of debris, all that was left of a big building, and hauling off bits of wreckage as they looked for survivors. Occasionally they raised their hands and called for quiet, listening for sounds of life.U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke by phone with Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu on Monday about the earthquake, State Department spokesperson Ned Price said.He made the call ""in the first instance to offer condolences and to make clear...that anything Turkey needed that we could provide, they should pick up the phone and let us know,” Price said. Erdogan said 45 countries had offered to help the search and rescue efforts in Turkey.The earthquake also halted operations at Turkey's oil export hub in Ceyhan and stopped crude flows from Iraq and Azerbaijan.Turkey's lira hit a record low of 18.85 TRYTOM=D3, TRY= in early trade and the country's stocks tumbled around 5%, although both pared losses later with the currency ending the day flat and equity indexes closing 1.3%-2.2% lower.In the Turkish city of Malatya, a rescue worker crawled into a collapsed building, trying to identify a survivor trapped under the wreckage, in footage released by emergency agency AFAD.""What colour are you wearing? Are you wearing pink? Please take care of yourself for the moment, I cannot see anything else,"" the rescue worker could be heard saying.",2023/2/7,448,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802416,U.S. imposes security zone in search for Chinese balloon remnants,"WASHINGTON/BEIJING, Feb 6 (Reuters) - The U.S. Coast Guard on Monday imposed a temporary security zone in waters off South Carolina during the military's search and recovery of debris from a suspected Chinese spy balloon that a U.S. fighter jet shot down.The White House said the balloon's flight over the United States had done nothing to improve already tense relations with China and its national security spokesperson dismissed Beijing's contention that the balloon was for meteorological purposes as straining credulity.Beijing condemned the shooting down of the balloon and urged Washington to show restraint over the episode. White House national security spokesperson John Kirby told reporters: ""Nobody wants to see conflict here.""U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken postponed a planned Feb.5-6 visit to China because of the balloon's flight into U.S. airspace last week. It was shot down off the Atlantic Coast on Saturday.Kirby said Blinken would seek to reschedule the trip when the time is right.The trip to Beijing would have been the first by a U.S. secretary of state since 2018 as the United States and China have sought to mend ties that have been under severe strain over a range of disagreements, including U.S. attempts to block Chinese access to some cutting-edge technologies.INTELLIGENCE GATHERINGThe United States was able to study the balloon while it was aloft and officials hope to glean valuable intelligence on its operations by retrieving as many components as possible, Kirby said.China called the shooting down of the balloon an ""obvious overreaction"".""China firmly opposes and strongly protests against this,"" Vice Foreign Minister Xie Feng said in remarks to the U.S. embassy in Beijing posted on the ministry's website.U.S. officials have played down the balloon's impact on national security, although a successful recovery could potentially give the United States insight into China's spying capabilities.Senior U.S. officials have offered to brief former Trump administration officials on the details of what the White House said was three China balloon overflights when Donald Trump was president. U.S. officials said those balloons came to light after Trump left office in January 2021 and was succeeded by President Joe Biden.A senior U.S. general responsible for bringing down the balloon said on Monday the military had not detected previous spy balloons before the one that appeared on Jan. 28 over the United States and called it an ""awareness gap.""However, Air Force General Glen VanHerck, head of U.S. North American Aerospace Defense Command and Northern Command said U.S. intelligence determined the previous flights after the fact based on ""additional means of collection"" of intelligence without offering further details on whether that might be cyber espionage, telephone intercepts or human sources.On Monday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said China learned that its balloon had drifted over the United States after being notified by Washington.""The unintended entry of this airship (into the U.S.) is entirely an isolated, accidental incident.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802419,Disbarred lawyer Girardi pleads not guilty to client thefts,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Disbarred lawyer Tom Girardi had not guilty pleas entered on his behalf Monday on charges he embezzled millions of dollars from some of the massive settlements he won for clients during a once prominent career. 

            Girardi, 83, is charged in Los Angeles federal court with wire fraud for allegedly stealing more than $15 million from clients that included an Arizona widow whose husband was killed in boat accident, a Los Angeles couple injured in a car wreck that paralyzed their son and a man who was severely burned in the 2010 San Bruno gas pipeline explosion. 

            As one of the nation’s most prominent plaintiff’s attorneys, Girardi took on powerful corporations, movie studios and Pacific Gas and Electric in a case that led to a $333 million settlement, which was portrayed in the 2000 Julia Roberts film “Erin Brockovich.”











            But Girardi's law empire collapsed and he faces mounting legal problems. 

            He lost his law license last year because of client thefts, creditors of his bankrupt Girardi Keese firm are seeking more than $500 million and he's in divorce proceedings with Erika Jayne, who starred on “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.” 

            He's gone from living in a mansion in Pasadena to an assisted living facility memory care unit, where attorneys say he has Alzheimer's and is under a court conservatorship.

            Girardi also faces federal wire fraud charges in Chicago, where he is accused of stealing about $3 million from family members of victims in a 2018 Lion Air crash that killed 189 people.

            Public defenders in LA are seeking a mental competency evaluation for Girardi that will determine if he can stand trial.

            Girardi, wearing a purple V-neck sweater and blue shirt, appeared to be frail as he walked slowly into a federal courthouse in front of cameras. He was released on a $250,000 bond.

            Girardi is charged in California and Illinois alongside his firm's chief financial officer, Christopher Kamon, 49, who did not appear in court Monday. He is jailed on a separate wire fraud case in which he’s accused of embezzling law firm funds to renovate two LA-area homes, pay for shopping sprees and hire an escort.

            Kamon is due in a Chicago court Tuesday. Girardi’s arraignment there is scheduled for March 3.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802420,N. Korean leader orders military to improve war readiness,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has ordered his military to expand its combat exercises and strengthen war preparedness as he looks to escalate an already provocative run in weapons demonstrations in the face of deepening tensions with its neighbors and Washington. 

            Kim presided over a meeting of the ruling Workers’ Party’s Central Military Commission on Monday and encouraged the armed forces to perform “ever-victorious feats” and display “matchless military strength” to open a new phase in development, the country’s official Korean Central News Agency reported Tuesday.

            The meeting came amid signs North Korea is planning a military parade that may be an occasion to showcase the latest hardware from his growing nuclear weapons and missile program that’s brewing concern for the United States and its allies in Asia.











            The commission’s members, who represent Kim’s top military brass, discussed a series of tasks aimed at inducing “great change” in the military, including “constantly expanding and intensifying the operation and combat drills” and “more strictly perfecting the preparedness for war,” the agency said.

            The commission also discussed unspecified organizational changes to “fundamentally improve and strengthen” military affairs, and state media photos of the meeting showed a flag representing a possibly new department called the “missile general bureau.” 

            North Korea marks the 75th founding anniversary of the Korean People’s Army on Wednesday and may celebrate with a parade in Pyongyang. 

            Lee Sung-jun, spokesperson of South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff, said during a briefing that the South Korean military has detected a “significant increase in personnel and vehicles” in areas related to parade rehearsals, but declined to share a specific assessment on when the event would take place. 

            Lee said the South Korean military was closely monitoring developments related to North Korea’s possible creation of a new military bureau related to missiles, but didn’t provide further details. Some analysts say that the new department could possibly handle the development of nuclear warheads and ballistic systems. 

            Kim's comments from the military meeting are the latest warning from Pyongyang that it’s preparing to intensify its military demonstrations following a record-breaking year in missile testing. The warnings are in part a response to the United States’ expanding military drills with South Korea, which the allies have said are aimed at countering the North’s evolving threat. 

            Last week, North Korea threatened to counter U.S. military moves with the “most overwhelming nuclear force” as it condemned U.S. plans to expand its joint exercise with South Korea and deploy more advanced military assets like bombers and aircraft carriers to the region.

            North Korea fired more than 70 ballistic missiles in 2022, including potential nuclear-capable weapons designed to strike targets in South Korea or reach the U.S. mainland. It also conducted a slew of launches it described as simulated nuclear attacks on South Korean and U.S. targets in response to the expanded U.S. military drills with South Korea, which had been downsized during the Trump administration.

            During a major political conference in December, Kim called for an “exponential increase” of the country’s nuclear warheads, mass production of battlefield tactical nukes targeting South Korea and the development of more powerful intercontinental ballistic missiles that could reach the American homeland.

            Experts say Kim’s weapons tests and threats are aimed at forcing Washington to accept the idea of North Korea as a nuclear power, which Pyongyang sees as a way to negotiate economic and political concession from a position of strength. 

            But there are also signs that the costs of Kim’s growing nuclear ambitions are piling up. North Korean state media said Monday that the ruling Workers’ Party has scheduled a plenary meeting of its powerful Central Committee later this month to discuss the “urgent task” on improving agricultural production amid deepening economic isolation. 

            Some experts have said that the country’s food insecurity is likely at its worst state since the 1990s when a devastating famine killed hundreds of thousands of people.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802421,Vikings hire Brian Flores as defensive coordinator,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The Minnesota Vikings hired Brian Flores as their defensive coordinator on Monday, their first step toward trying to revive a once-dominant unit that ranked among the NFL's worst last season.

            Flores was a senior defensive assistant and linebackers coach this season for Pittsburgh, after three years as head coach in Miami.

            Prior to being hired by the Dolphins, Flores was an assistant for 11 seasons for New England, the last eight on the defensive side. The Patriots won four Super Bowls during his time there, which included four years as a scout. The last of those was in the 2018 season, which was Flores' first as the defensive play-caller. The Patriots jumped from 17th to seventh in the league that year in opponent passer rating (85.4) and were tied for fifth with 28 takeaways.











            After he was fired by the Dolphins, Flores, who is Black, filed a class-action lawsuit alleging racial discrimination by the team and the NFL. The case is still tied up in the court system.

            With the Steelers, the 41-year-old Flores drew rave reviews from players who saw him as an extra head coach on Mike Tomlin's staff. The Steelers were tied with the Patriots this season for the fewest rushing touchdowns (seven) allowed in the league.

            Flores replaces Ed Donatell, who was fired last month after one year with head coach Kevin O'Connell. The Vikings were second-worst in the league in yards allowed and fourth-worst in points allowed during the regular season. The NFC North champions were then ousted from the playoffs in the wild-card round by the New York Giants as quarterback Daniel Jones threw for 301 yards and rushed for 78 more.

            The Vikings also interviewed Seattle associate head coach Sean Desai, Pittsburgh senior defensive New Orleans co-defensive coordinator Ryan Nielsen and their own assistant head coach Mike Pettine, who was Green Bay's defensive coordinator from 2018-20 and also the head coach for Cleveland from 2014-15.

            Nielsen was hired as Atlanta's defensive coordinator. Desai withdrew from consideration. The Vikings also had interest in former Denver defensive coordinator Ejiro Evero, but he made a lateral move to take the job with Carolina and never wound up interviewing with Minnesota.

            The Vikings under Donatell favored a four-man rush with two high safeties backing their zone pass coverage, but over their last eight regular-season games they forced only seven turnovers and totaled 12 sacks. Jones picked them apart underneath in the playoff game, going 24 for 35.

            Four cornerbacks will be free agents next month: primary starters Patrick Peterson, Duke Shelley and Chandon Sullivan and backup Kris Boyd. The Vikings also have four core defensive players carrying eight-figure salary-cap hits: safety Harrison Smith, outside linebackers Za'Darius Smith and Danielle Hunter and inside linebacker Eric Kendricks. Only Hunter has not reached his 30s.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802423,India's Adani crisis spills over into street protests as losses top $110 bln,"The crisis engulfing the Adani Group intensified on Monday as hundreds of members of India's opposition parties took to the streets to press for a probe into allegations by a U.S. short-seller against the conglomerate which triggered its market rout.Shares in billionaire Gautam Adani's companies have been in free-fall since a Jan. 24 critical report by Hindenberg Research, with group cumulative market losses now topping $110 billion, sparking fears of wider financial contagion.Opposition parties, who last week called for a parliamentary panel to investigate the saga and disrupted proceedings, have questioned Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's closeness with Adani.Protesters on Monday also expressed anger about investments made by state-backed Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) LIFI.NS and State Bank of India (SBI) SBI.NS in the Adani Group.Adani has rejected in detailed rebuttals the Hindenberg report's allegations of stock manipulation, use of tax havens and criticism that it had unsustainable debt.The billionaire and Modi are from the same state and Adani has repeatedly denied allegations by Modi's opponents that he had benefited from their close ties. Modi's government too has denied allegations of favouring Adani.At New Delhi's Jantar Mantar, a Mughal-era observatory that doubles up as a protest site for all causes, protesters held up banners and shouted slogans against Adani. Some broke through barricades, forcing the police to detain them.""Common man has invested his money in a businessman's (Gautam Adani) company and the government is trying to save him. The government is supporting the businessman (Adani) and not the common man,"" Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee General Secretary Shiv Panday was quoted as saying by ANI news agency.Hundreds of members of the Congress party protested across the country, including outside several offices of state-owned insurer Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) LIFI.NS and State Bank of India (SBI) SBI.NS, both of which have exposure to Adani group companies.At Jantar Mantar some burnt a suitcase with an SBI logo on it. In Mumbai, a protester held a placard with Adani's photo and the LIC logo, explaining with a bar chart ""How much has LIC invested in Adani Group"".LIC holds a 4.23% stake in the flagship Adani firm, while its other exposures include a 9.14% stake in Adani Ports and 5.96% in Adani Total Gas. SBI said last week its total exposure to Adani Group was 0.9% of its total loan book, or around 270 billion rupees ($3.30 billion).LIC and SBI did not respond to a request for comment.Separately, a move by Adani Group on Monday to calm investor nerves failed to stem the market rout. It said it would pre-pay loans of around $1.1 billion taken against pledged stocks in Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone APSE.NS, Adani Transmission ADAI.NS and Adani Green Energy ADNA.NS, allowing it to get back the shares.Shares of Adani Enterprises closed down 0.9% on Monday after sinking as much as 9.6% in early trade. Adani Transmission dropped lost 10%, while Adani Green, Adani Total Gas Ltd ADAG.NS, Adani Power ADAN.NS, and Adani Wilmar ADAW.NS fell 5% each.Adani Ports rose 9.3%, the only stock to buck the trend.WORSENING CRISISThe crisis has snowballed into the biggest business and reputational challenge for 60-year-old Adani, whose fortunes had rapidly risen in recent years as he expanded his conglomerate's business interests that stretch from ports to mining.Both houses of India's parliament were adjourned on Monday, the third consecutive day, amid sloganeering and demands to launch an inquiry.In the brutal fallout of Hindenburg's report, Adani group flagship company Adani Enterprises Ltd ADEL.NS was forced to abandon a $2.5 billion share sale last week, and Adani lost his crown as Asia's richest person and slipped down the global rankings of the wealthy.Adani had planned to issue a credit report by Friday to address concerns raised by Hindenburg about its liquidity, Reuters reported. The report is expected to be released this week, said a source with direct knowledge of the matter.The stock market rout triggered a series of credit ratings warnings on Friday with Moody's saying the group may struggle to raise capital, and S&P cutting its outlook on two group companies.India's banking and markets regulators, as well as the government, have initiated inquiries to calm spooked investors. The latter has written to various custodian banks asking for details on beneficial owners of offshore funds and foreign portfolio investors (FPIs), Reuters reported.(Reporting by Aditi Shah, Adnan Abidi, M Sriram, Aditya Kalra, Nallur Sethuraman, Shilpa Jamkhandikar; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman and Emelia Sithole-Matarise)",2023/2/7,462,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802429,146 NYC police committed misconduct in 2020 protests: Report,"Nearly 150 New York City police officers committed misconduct, including using excessive force, while responding to the 2020 protests over the killing of George Floyd, according to a report released Monday by a civilian review board.

            The city's Civilian Complaint Review Board, or CCRB, also found that many officers disciplined by the police department received punishment that was less than the panel recommended, and in some cases officers found to have committed misconduct were not disciplined at all.

            Investigations into more than 600 complaints about police conduct during the protests had to be closed because officers could not be identified. In many cases that was because police purposely wore mourning bands over their badges or refused to provide their names, or because the department failed to track where officers were deployed, the 590-page report says.











            The board received 321 complaints during the protests that were determined to be within its jurisdiction and 226 were investigated.

            The document describes, for example, police actions during one protest in Brooklyn on May 30, 2020, that drew numerous complaints.

            An officer drove a police vehicle into the crowd and knocked protesters to the ground. Another officer pulled down a demonstrator’s coronavirus-protecting mask and pepper sprayed him in the face. On the Brooklyn Bridge that day, officers tackled protesters and hit them in the head with batons, the report says.

            The panel substantiated 269 allegations of misconduct against 146 officers, including 140 allegations of excessive force and 72 claims of abuse of authority, including officers refusing to provide their names or obstructing their badges. The allegations that were sustained included 34 for improperly striking people with batons and 28 for improperly using pepper spray.

            “Protests against police brutality bred more instances of police misconduct,” Arva Rice, the review board's chair, said in a statement. “If this misconduct goes unaddressed, it will never be reformed.”

            The document includes recommendations for change.

            The NYPD said it objects to many of the board's characterizations. In a statement, it said many, if not all, of the review board's recommendations already have been implemented in response to the department's own review and proposals by other agencies.

            “A key element missing from this report is any acknowledgement that officers were performing their utmost duty, protecting the city and its people, under what were often sustained, dangerous conditions,” the department said.

            The agency also said the 226 complaints reviewed by the board contained 1,800 allegations, and only 15% of those were substantiated. The number of officers found to have committed misconduct was only a fraction of the more than 20,000 on duty daily at the height of the protests. Some demonstrators were looting, setting fires and destroying property, the department noted.

            The NYPD said more than 400 officers were injured during the protests, including 250 who were hospitalized.

            Patrick Lynch, the head of the Police Benevolent Association, also was critical.

            “Once again, the anti-cop activists at CCRB are trying to pin the blame on individual police officers for management failures and the chaos created by violent agitators,"" he said in a statement. ""We are still awaiting ‘accountability’ for the city leaders who sent us out with no plan and no support, and for the criminals who injured more than 400 of our brothers and sisters.”

            The board recommended charges and other discipline against 89 officers. Of those cases, three were resolved through guilty pleas, four officers forfeited vacation days, five officers retired or resigned before disciplinary action could be taken, nine officers were not disciplined by the department and administrative proceedings are pending against 62 officers, the report said.

            It made a series of recommendations including that all officers get updated training on crowd control tactics. The board also said police should not interfere with members of the press, that officers' names and shield numbers should be visible at all times and that the department should assess how it uses various tactics and tools during protests.

            The New York Civil Liberties Union said the report shows how officers responded with violence.

            “This report gives the public a new window into the scale of officer misconduct, crucial access to troves of internal records and, in the end, stark evidence of the NYPD’s unwillingness to hold officers accountable,"" Molly Biklen, the New York ACLU's deputy legal director, said in a statement.Nearly 150 New York City police officers committed misconduct, including using excessive force, while responding to the 2020 protests over the killing of George Floyd, according to a report released Monday by a civilian review board.The city's Civilian Complaint Review Board, or CCRB, also found that many officers disciplined by the police department received punishment that was less than the panel recommended, and in some cases officers found to have committed misconduct were not disciplined at all.Investigations into more than 600 complaints about police conduct during the protests had to be closed because officers could not be identified.

Some demonstrators were looting, setting fires and destroying property, the department noted.The NYPD said more than 400 officers were injured during the protests, including 250 who were hospitalized.Patrick Lynch, the head of the Police Benevolent Association, also was critical.“Once again, the anti-cop activists at CCRB are trying to pin the blame on individual police officers for management failures and the chaos created by violent agitators,"" he said in a statement. ""We are still awaiting ‘accountability’ for the city leaders who sent us out with no plan and no support, and for the criminals who injured more than 400 of our brothers and sisters.”The board recommended charges and other discipline against 89 officers. Of those cases, three were resolved through guilty pleas, four officers forfeited vacation days, five officers retired or resigned before disciplinary action could be taken, nine officers were not disciplined by the department and administrative proceedings are pending against 62 officers, the report said.It made a series of recommendations including that all officers get updated training on crowd control tactics. The board also said police should not interfere with members of the press, that officers' names and shield numbers should be visible at all times and that the department should assess how it uses various tactics and tools during protests.The New York Civil Liberties Union said the report shows how officers responded with violence.“This report gives the public a new window into the scale of officer misconduct, crucial access to troves of internal records and, in the end, stark evidence of the NYPD’s unwillingness to hold officers accountable,"" Molly Biklen, the New York ACLU's deputy legal director, said in a statement.",2023/2/7,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802430,Australia T20 skipper Finch quits international cricket,"MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Aaron Finch has retired from all international cricket after leading Australia in a record 76 games as captain of the Twenty20 squad. 

            
                Finch guided Australia to its first T20 world championship in 2021 and was captain again last year in its unsuccessful title defense on home soil. 

            The 36-year-old top-order batter also won a Cricket World Cup title with Australia in the 50-over format at home in 2015 and played five test matches across an international career spanning 12 years.











            “Realizing that I won’t be playing on until the next T20 World Cup in 2024, now is the right moment to step down and give the team time to plan and build towards that event,"" Finch said in a news conference Tuesday at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. 

            Fast bowler Pat Cummins became captain of Australia's ODI team when Finch retired from the one-day format last October to focus on T20 cricket. Cricket Australia hasn't announced a replacement for the T20 team. 

            Australia was dominant in the traditional one-day format, winning four of the last six World Cups, but wasn't able to convert that into the T20 version of the game until Finch's squad won an against-the-odds title in the United Arab Emirates in late 2021.

            In all, Finch played 146 ODIs at an average of almost 39, and 103 T20 internationals at an average of 34.28 and a strike-rate of 142.53. He has twice held the record for highest score in a T20 international, posting 156 against England in 2013 and then setting the current mark of 172 against Zimbabwe at Harare in 2018.

            Cricket Australia chairman Lachlan Henderson said Finch finished as one of Australia's best limited-overs players.

            “In full flight, there were few batters more powerful than Aaron, illustrated by the fact he holds two of the three highest ever scores in T20 International cricket,” Henderson said. “While he was a tough competitor on the field, Aaron always played the game with a smile on his face and in the right spirit.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802434,Kantar reveals findings on consumer sentiments towards electric vehicles,"Chinese EV brands are expanding beyond China

  Chinese EV brands have great potentials to fill market gaps in Europe and USA. 6 of the top 10 aware EV brands are based in China.  Value for money is the top strength of Chinese EV brands.  Key purchase motive for EV is to keep up with advanced technologies and trends.  Concerns related to driving range are shown as the main barrier.  SHANGHAI, CHINA - Media OutReach - 7 February 2023 -  The Chinese government is committed to reaching carbon emission peak by 2030, and the promotion of new energy vehicles is one of the main policy directions. In 2022, China accounted for over half of global electric vehicle (EV) sales, making it the world's largest and one of the fastest growing EV markets. Kantar, the world's leading data-driven analytics and brand consulting company, has recently conducted a self-funded multi-country study to understand consumer sentiment towards the high-potential market. The investigation gathered the opinions of 4,620 consumers through an online survey, using LifePoints online communities in US, mainland China, Hong Kong, Germany, Norway, Denmark, and Sweden. It explored several related topics, including purchase motives & barriers; purchase journey & touchpoints; market positioning of Chinese EV brands domestically and their potential to win internationally.   In terms of purchase motives, EV owners expressed key reasons for buying EV is to keep up with advanced technologies and trends. Concerns related to driving range (43%) were shown as the main barrier for all, or what we named ""range anxiety"" in the study. From a practicality standpoint, EV considerers named driving range (46%), battery durability (43%), charging speed (42%) and availability of charging stations (41%) as the top 4 triggers that will determine their switch, and selection of brand/ car model. In foreign markets, including US and Germany, another important barrier towards the switch to EV, is the significant higher price compares to non-EV (42%). This indicates the limited choice of EV in the more affordable price car range in some countries, and the importance of government subsidies to accelerate adoptions of EV, as shown by the successes in the Nordic countries, such as Norway, Denmark, and Sweden.   Despite information is increasingly digitalized, when it comes to the consideration phase of potential EV buyers, we discovered that not all online information channels are equally important or necessary. For example, we found that there is good acceptance towards more neutral/UGC (user generated content) alike information. The study also found that an average EV buyer will use up to 8 information channels (online and offline) before making a purchase. We believe only prudent selection of channels that best fit the brands' DNA and target audience will optimize marketing efficiency, and therefore purchase conversion. Offline store experiences and car exhibitions/events are among the top 3 information channels as rated by our respondents, and with no surprise, a good test drive experience is still utmost important to make that final conversion (47%). An interesting finding though, was that EV owners or intenders in mainland China shows better acceptance towards newer retail experiences than other countries researched (64% in mainland China compared to 41% in other markets).   For the awareness of EV brands among our respondents in mainland China, Tesla came top (75%), followed by BYD (73%), Xpeng (65%) and Nio (64%). 6 of the top 10 aware are Chinese brands. When it comes to Chinese EV brands that are already available outside of China, the top two aware brands are Xpeng and Nio. It indicates that Chinese consumers are open to both local and foreign EV brands, while Chinese EV brands such as Xpeng and Nio are generating good awareness and interest in certain countries, despite only being a relatively newcomer. Value for money is perceived as the top strength of Chinese EV brands outside of China.   Jeff Tsui, Managing Director of Kantar Profiles, Greater China commented:   ""With the world being ever more environmentally conscious, combined with heightened fuel prices and advancement in technologies, I believe the prosperity of EV is at all-time high. As noted in another study conducted by Kantar Profiles recently, 38% of those who intend to buy a car this year, will consider buying an EV. Such prosperity is no longer restricted to the traditional automotive manufacturers, but others who are keen to invest in this space and have the right brand or product DNAs to be successful. Good examples are Baidu's EV project Jidu Auto; the Sony Mobility Vision-S etc, all having different and strong reasons why I think it could be a success.   While the findings of this study indicated that Chinese EV brands, under the value for money proposition, have the potentials to fill the gap in certain countries, it is also important for these companies to continue their advancement to create more sustainable comparative advantages on a product level, and to play a more pivotal role in the ecosystem / infrastructure surrounding the adoption and use of EVs globally, to truly win the heart of consumers.""   Chris Jansen, CEO (Chief Executive Officer) of Kantar group commented:   ""We see a substantial growth opportunity to be addressed in the EV space. Our Mobility Futures research clearly indicates that hybrid and electric vehicles are entering more consumers' consideration sets thanks to their environmental reputation. The findings from our Covid-19 Barometer work also showed us that the pandemic further increased consumers' prioritisation of environmental issues. Kantar BrandZ illustrates very clearly that improving the EV portfolio is enormously beneficial for automakers' brand valuations, and although Tesla is currently the clear leader in this space, we see both disruptors and incumbents making considerable progress. From the work we are doing with automakers around the world, it is clear the EV space and the urban mobility space more broadly will be incredibly dynamic over the next few years.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802439,Taiwan sends 2 search and rescue teams to aid Turkey following deadly quake,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwan has sent two search and rescue teams to Turkey following the deadly 7.8 magnitude Kahramanmaras earthquake that struck the nation on Monday (Feb. 6).

            With the consent of the Turkish government, Taiwan dispatched an advance 40-member team on Monday night, according to a Ministry of Foreign Affairs press release. The team consists of members from the Taipei City Fire Department and the National Fire Agency. The group will bring 6.6 tons of equipment with them, along with three search and rescue dogs.

            Foreign Minister Joseph Wu (吳釗燮) presented a Taiwan flag to the advance team at Taoyuan International Airport Monday night before they left. Wu said he hoped the team will do everything possible to save lives during this time.

            Wu pointed out that when the 9/21 earthquake hit Taiwan in 1999, the Turkish government organized a rescue team to come to the nation’s aid. Thus, upon hearing of Monday’s quake, the Taiwan government immediately decided to send a search and rescue team to assist our Turkish friends, Wu said.











            “This is a demonstration of the sincere friendship between Taiwan and Turkey,” he said.

            On Tuesday night (Feb. 7), another 90-member team departed for Turkey, bringing two more search and rescue dogs with them..

            Earlier on Monday, the Taiwan government announced a donation of US$200,000 (NT$5.9 million) to Turkey for disaster relief and post-quake resettlement, MOFA said. MOFA Director General of Asian and African Affairs Anthony Chung-Yi Ho (賀忠義) has already expressed Taiwan’s sincere condolences to Turkish Representative to Taiwan Muhammed Berdibek.

            The earthquake occurred 23 kilometers east of Nurdagi, located in Turkey's Gaziantep province, at a depth of 24.1 kilometers. It affected other Turkish provinces, including Hatay and Adana, as well as parts of Syria. It was one of the strongest quakes in more than a century, CNN reported.

            The foreign ministry called on Taiwanese currently in Turkey to be vigilant and pay attention to aftershocks that may occur at any time. If they need emergency assistance, nationals can call the Taipei Economic and Cultural Mission in Ankara (+90-532-322-7162), or contact MOFA (0800-085-095).TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwan has sent two search and rescue teams to Turkey following the deadly 7.8 magnitude Kahramanmaras earthquake that struck the nation on Monday (Feb. 6).With the consent of the Turkish government, Taiwan dispatched an advance 40-member team on Monday night, according to a Ministry of Foreign Affairs press release.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802442,Texas attorney shot by Cheney during 2006 hunting trip dies,"Harry Whittington, the man who former Vice President Dick Cheney accidentally shot while they were hunting quail on a Texas ranch 17 years ago, has died. He was 95.

            Whittington died at his home Saturday in Austin, family friend Karl Rove said Monday. 

            Before Whittington was thrust into the national spotlight after the accidental shooting, the attorney was long known for helping build the Republican Party in Texas into the dominant political force it is today and for being the man governors went to when they needed to clean up troubled state agencies.











            Rove, an influential Republican strategist and former adviser to former President George W. Bush, said Whittington was “a man of enormous integrity and deep compassion” who was called on by leaders for “important tasks.” 

            Whittington and others were hunting with Cheney on the sprawling Armstrong Ranch in South Texas on Feb. 11, 2006, when Cheney, while aiming for a bird, struck Whittington, who was 78 at the time. The accident wasn’t publicly reported until the next day when the ranch owner called the local newspaper — the Corpus Christi Caller-Times — and told the paper what had happened.

            Whittington was sprayed with birdshot pellets to his face, neck and chest and suffered a minor heart attack due to a pellet near his heart. When he left he hospital about a week after the accident, he said “accidents do and will happen,” and apologized to Cheney, saying he was “deeply sorry for everything” Cheney and his family had to deal with after the incident.

            Cheney was criticized for breaking a cardinal rule of hunting — that someone holding a gun should make sure they know what they are firing at before pulling the trigger — and for not immediately going public with what happened.

            The accident also spawned countless jokes. Jay Leno, then-host of “The Tonight Show” on NBC, quipped that Cheney would be capitalizing on the accident for the upcoming Valentine’s Day with a new cologne named “Duck.” Billionaire Bill Gates greeted his audience at a conference by saying, ""I’m really glad to be here. My other invitation was to go quail hunting with Dick Cheney.” 

            In an interview with Fox News days after the accident, Cheney said it was “one of the worst days of my life at that moment.”

            Cheney said the accident happened after Whittington had stepped out of the hunting party to get a downed bird in deep cover. Cheney said Whittington was dressed properly in orange and the upper part of his body was visible, but that he was standing in a gully with the sun behind him.

            “You can’t blame anybody else,” Cheney said. “I’m the guy who pulled the trigger and shot my friend.”

            Whittington owned a downtown Austin building where many of the state's GOP power brokers built their empires. Bush used the building for his gubernatorial campaign headquarters, as did former Texas Gov. Rick Perry. Rove also had his office there.

            Whittington was a longtime player in Texas politics. In 1961, he worked on John Tower’s campaign for the U.S. Senate and later helped a young Bush run for Congress, a race he lost. He was also a go-to guy for governors trying to clean up troubled state agencies and spent decades serving on state boards.

            In the 1980s, Republican Gov. Bill Clements appointed him to the former Texas Board of Corrections, which oversaw a state prison system a federal judge had declared unconstitutional because of brutal conditions.

            Whittington became an advocate for change in a prison system that lacked basic medical care and where people serving time were subjected to beatings by other inmates. He was also an advocate of the rights of inmates who have mental disabilities.

            Bush, then governor of Texas, appointed him in 1999 to lead a restructured Texas Funeral Services Commission, which was embroiled in a whistleblower lawsuit.

            Rove said Whittington not only served his community in countless ways but was also “an enormous source of good counsel and mentorship to dozens,” including him. He said Whittington was not only his landlord, but also the secretary and treasurer of his company.

            “He was an extraordinary human being, and to be remembered as being the victim of a hunting accident sort of gripes me,"" Rove said.Harry Whittington, the man who former Vice President Dick Cheney accidentally shot while they were hunting quail on a Texas ranch 17 years ago, has died.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802448,Canada expands temporary work permit program for Hong Kong residents,"The Canadian government is broadening the criteria for Hong Kong residents to apply to work in Canada through a temporary work permit program that was introduced after China imposed new security rules on the former British colony in 2020, Immigration Minister Sean Fraser said on Monday.Hong Kong residents who have graduated from a post-secondary learning institution within the past 10 years can now apply to work in Canada, from an earlier limit of five years after graduation. The program, which was due to expire on Tuesday, was also extended until Feb. 7, 2025.Canada depends on immigration to drive its economy and support an aging population, and Fraser said expanding the work permit program for Hong Kong residents was a ""win-win"" for both parties.""It gives Hong Kong residents more opportunity to gain work experience here in Canada, but it also allows us to support the Canadian economy by bringing workers at a time when they're needed most,"" Fraser said.The program also allows Hong Kong residents with Canadian work experience or education to apply for permanent residency.Ottawa set up the immigration program two years ago after China imposed a sweeping national security law on Hong Kong, outlawing a wide range of political activities and effectively putting an end to public protests.Western governments have criticized the law as a tool to crush dissent, a charge China denies. More than 230 people have been arrested since the law was imposed.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802456,"Taipei to close Wanhua recycling yard, recyclers' incomes at risk","TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A community run recycling yard in Wanhua District that has been operating for nearly 50 years has been ordered to shut down by the Taipei City Department of Urban Development.The recycling yard processes recyclables collected by about 200 people every day according to Ngóo-kak (五角拌), the youth run community group that manages the site. The group said that if forced to close, many of the elderly, disabled, and otherwise disadvantaged people who gather recycling and sell it there would lose their already meager incomes.“Many people whose time and physical and mental conditions are difficult to integrate into the mainstream job market often choose waste picking,” Ngóo-kak said on Thursday (Feb. 2). “Waste picking work can be said to be the last line of defense for the disadvantaged to live independently.”The income from collecting recycling for over 12 hours per working day often fails to exceed NT$6000 per month (US$200), while nearly a third of the recyclers are women over 65, according to Ngóo-kak.The manager of the recycling center surnamed Huang (黃), told reporters the yard had been open since 1965, passing through three generations of his family. He said he was notified by the Taipei City Government in Nov. that the center violated land use laws and would have to close.Ngóo-kak says that after years of disadvantaged recyclers helping keep the community clean, the government is now abandoning them. “(The recyclers) should become cooperators in the transformation of the urban environment and net-zero emissions,” they said.Acting Chief of the Urban Planning Division of the Department of Urban Development Su Hsin-hui (蘇芯慧) said that the land was in a type 3 residential area, in which resource recycling yards are illegal. She said that in order to comply with the Local Government Act, the plant would need to relocate to an appropriately zoned area and pass a government inspection.Ngóo-kak is calling on Taipei City to improve land use laws and regulations to adapt to social and environmental changes, in order to allow recycling yards such as theirs to stay open in central areas.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802489,"Jayson Tatum scores 34, Celtics cruise past Pistons 111-99","DETROIT (AP) — Jayson Tatum started slow and finished strong with 34 points, 11 rebounds and six assists, leading the Boston Celtics to a 111-99 victory over the Detroit Pistons on Monday night.

            “You know at some point, he’s going to be a superstar,"" Pistons coach Dwane Casey said.

            The All-Star forward missed his first five shots and had as many fouls (three) as field goals after missing 10 shots in the first half. Tatum made three 3-pointers and an array of driving layups in the third, scoring 18 points in the quarter to turn a seven-point halftime lead into a 18-point cushion.











            “He took what the defense gave him,"" Celtics interim coach Joe Mazzulla said. “He got downhill. He was aggressive. I thought he took some really good shots early in the shot clock to keep his confidence going.""

            With Tatum on the bench, Detroit rallied to pull within seven points midway through the fourth quarter. Seconds after entering the game, the All-NBA player promptly set up Robert Williams for a dunk on his fourth assist to help stunt the potential comeback.

            Tatum was 11 of 23 overall, 3 of 9 on 3-pointers, and 9 of 10 at the line.

            “A guy like that, you give him any opportunity, he’s going to take it,"" Detroit guard Killian Hayes said. “He didn't make a 3-pointers in the first half, and then he hit one and he's hard to guard. A guy like that, you can't let him get going.""

            Celtics guard Jaylen Brown, who averages 27 points, missed the game with a non-COVID illness. Sam Hauser filled in, making his first start in two seasons, and had five 3-pointers in the first half when he scored all of his 15 points.

            Hauser said he was informed of the opportunity about 90 minutes before the game started.

            “It kind of took me by surprise,"" he said. “I thought they would maybe plug someone else in to start. They called my number and I was ready for it. It was my first start ever in the NBA, and it was a cool moment.""

            Boston reserves Marcus Smart and Luke Kornet (left ankle) missed the game with ankle injuries.

            Derrick White had 23 points, and reserve Malcolm Brogdon and Williams scored 15 points apiece for the Eastern Conference-leading Celtics, who lost four of their previous six games.

            “For 95% of the game, I thought we did a great job of taking away the momentum plays that Detroit is capable of making,"" Mazzulla said.

            Bojan Bogdanovic scored 21 for the Pistons, who have won just one-fourth of their games and are likely vying with Houston and Charlotte for the No. 1 pick and a chance to select 7-foot-3 French phenom Victor Wembanyama.

            Detroit rookies Jaden Ivey had 14 points and five assists, while Jalen Duren scored seven points and grabbed 14 rebounds. Hayes scored 17 points and fellow reserve Saddiq Bey added 14 for the Pistons, who have lost eight of their last 10 games.

            BEY OFF THE BENCH

            Casey likes what he's seeing with Bey, a former starter, settling into being a backup.

            “He’s found a rhythm and a niche with the second unit,"" Casey said. “Once we are ready to play for playoff positioning and championships, I feel like that’s going to be his role with us.""

            All five Cleveland starters were in double figures by halftime, and the Cavaliers won for the fourth time in five games. Evan Mobley finished with 16 points and Isaac Okoro contributed 12.

            Kristaps Porzingis scored 18 points for Washington, which has lost three straight following a six-game winning streak. The Wizards were playing without Bradley Beal (left foot soreness) and Kyle Kuzma (left ankle sprain).











            Washington led by at least 20 in each of its previous two losses, but the Wizards didn't have to worry about blowing a big lead on this night. In fact, they were never ahead at all.

            Cleveland shot 63% in the first half, leading 37-25 after one quarter and 66-46 after two.

            “To me, the most important thing is, there were very little up and downs,” coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. “We played at a consistently high level, and that's what we're aiming to do.”

            Caris LeVert, back after missing two games with a sore right hamstring, had a steal and dunk in the third quarter to make it 83-57. Cleveland led by as many as 28 points.

            “Offensively they were just comfortable,” Washington's Daniel Gafford said. “There was a lot of things that they did that kind of had us in scramble situations, time and time again down the floor. They just really just got the shots that they wanted.”

            Mitchell, who has been bothered by a groin issue recently, looked pretty spry when he threw down a windmill dunk on an alley-oop from Garland to make it 101-74.

            LeVert, who could be dealt this week because of his expiring contract and uncertain role, scored 10 points. 

            “He's a starter in this league. We're fortunate enough to have him now where he's in an opportunity where he's going against second-unit guys,” Bickerstaff said. “So he can be attack-minded, he can make them pay for mistakes, whether it's him scoring, whether it's him facilitating — and I think he's doing a great job on the defensive end.”

            Kevin Love, another possible trade candidate, did not play.

            NOT EVEN CLOSE

            This was Cleveland’s 24th double-digit win, which leads the league. The Cavaliers swept both halves of a back-to-back by a combined 42 points. They beat Indiana 122-103 on Sunday.

            “We're figuring it out at home, and then on the road you're starting to see positive signs,” Mitchell said. “Taking the crowd out early, responding to runs.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802491,"More funds head to Minn. attorney general, public defenders","ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — Millions of extra dollars are working their way through the Minnesota Legislature to both beef up the ability of Attorney General Keith Ellison's office to prosecute violent crime and the state's public defender system to relieve the staffing shortages that nearly led to a strike last year.

            Ellison assembled the team that got former Minneapolis Officer Derek Chauvin convicted of murdering George Floyd in 2021, but the Democratic attorney general had been unable for four years to persuade a divided Legislature to give him more money to hire more prosecutors. Now that Democrats control both chambers of the statehouse, Ellison is eager to get that money.

            The House voted 73-55 Monday night to give the attorney general's office a quick $269,000 from the state's $17.6 billion budget surplus and an extra $2 million a year thereafter, on top of its regular budget. The Senate approved the money last week and Ellison expects Democratic Gov. Tim Walz to sign it soon.











            Ellison's office was down to just one criminal prosecutor after years of budgetary pressures when he took office in 2019. He was able to raise that to three, but the former Senate Republican majority refused to fund any more despite a large budget surplus. Republican lawmakers wanted him to reassign lawyers who were working on consumer protection and business regulation instead. 

            The office had as many as 12 prosecutors as of 1998. The bill will let Ellison hire around seven new attorneys, and he said he hopes to add them in the next six to eight weeks.

            “Today we want to really build it back,"" Ellison said at a news conference ahead of the debate. ""Today recognize that the counties need the help. We recognize the spike in crime. We recognize the financial and fiscal pressures on our counties. And mostly we recognize the pain of the victims.”

            Democratic House Majority Leader Jamie Long, of Minneapolis, said the money will let the attorney general's office take on around 70 to 80 additional cases annually.

            Staffing became an issue in the 2022 election campaign, in which unsuccessful GOP candidate Jim Schultz accused Ellison of being too soft on crime. Ellison repeatedly pointed out that his office, by law, can take over a criminal case only at the request of local prosecutors or the governor. 

            When the attorney general's office prosecutes criminal cases, they're usually complex cases in rural counties where local prosecutors are short on resources and expertise, such as the shooting of a police officer in Albert Lea. Or they've been politically charged cases, such as Chauvin's trial or the successful manslaughter prosecution of Officer Kim Potter in the Taser mix-up shooting death of Daunte Wright. Ellison noted that 44 of Minnesota's 87 counties have three or fewer prosecutors.

            Earlier Monday, the House voted unanimously for more funding for the state Board of Public Defense so that it can meet what the American Bar Association recommends for manageable caseload standards. The bill contains $154 million for the fiscal year that begins July 1 and $164 million for the next, setting the board's full budget for the next two years. A similar bill is sailing through Senate committees, and Walz is expected to sign it, too.

            The Democratic chair of the House Judiciary Committee, Rep. Jamie Becker-Finn, of Roseville, told reporters it works out to around a $50 million annual increase from current levels. The extra money had bipartisan support in the 2022 session but stalled out amid partisan gridlock on other issues.

            “The integrity of our entire justice system rests on the public defense system,” Becker-Finn said. “You want to talk about liberty? None of those rights mean anything if you don't have assistance of counsel, and you don't have an adequate assistance of counsel. Outcomes should not be dictated based on your access to wealth.”

            The state's 470 public defenders came within days of walking out and bringing much of the state court system to a standstill before a deal was reached last March. They said they were pushed to the brink by routinely high caseloads that became unmanageable amid the coronavirus pandemic. They also complained their pay lagged far behind what prosecutors sitting across the table from them made. The money will help the board both raise pay and add lawyers.ST. PAUL, Minn.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802492,"No. 19 Miami rolls past Duke 81-59, moves to 13-0 at home","CORAL GABLES, Fla. (AP) — Miami guard Isaiah Wong pointed to the crowd, waving his arms, asking for noise, asking for the celebration to start.

            The lead, at that point, was 3-0.

            Didn’t matter. From start to finish, the Hurricanes were in total control —- and got a rare rout over Duke.











            Norchad Omier had 17 points and 10 rebounds, Jordan Miller added 16 points and No. 19 Miami never trailed on the way to a 81-59 win over Duke on Monday night.

            Wooga Poplar scored 14 and Wong scored 11 for Miami (19-5, 10-4 Atlantic Coast Conference). The Hurricanes led by as many as 26 and improved to 13-0 at home.

            “That was a great performance, from start to finish,” Miami coach Jim Larrañaga said. “There was a lot of energy. And all I can tell you is, everybody who came tonight's game is invited back — because that's the kind of environment that we'd love to have every night.”

            Ryan Young and Dereck Lively II each scored 11 points for Duke (17-7, 8-5), which saw its three-game winning streak snapped. Jeremy Roach added 10 points for the Blue Devils, who were outrebounded 38-31 and committed 21 turnovers.

            It was the second game this season where Duke never led, and the 22-point loss was its second-worst this season. The Blue Devils lost to N.C. State by 24 on Jan. 4.

            “Congratulations to Miami. There's a reason they haven't lost here at home,” Duke coach Jon Scheyer said. “They're really good. They obviously had it clicking on all cylinders right away.”

            It was the second-biggest Miami victory margin in the series between the schools, topped only by the Hurricanes’ 90-63 win over then-No. 1 Duke on Jan. 23, 2013. Miami also enjoyed huge edges in points off turnovers (23-9), second-chance points (24-9) and fast-break points (17-7).

            And Miami got payback for a 68-66 loss at Duke earlier this season.

            “We had something to prove,” Miller said. “They beat us last time. We were revved up for this game and we got it done.”

            Duke fans started leaving with 4:24 left and Miami up by 26, the Hurricanes’ student section serenading them as they departed.

            Miami ran out to a 13-1 lead and stretched it to 34-17 later in the first half, putting Duke in unfamiliar territory quickly. The Blue Devils had trailed by more than 15 in just two other games — by 29 to N.C. State, and by 19 to Purdue.

            “When you have 21 turnovers, you can’t expect yourself to have a good game,” Lively said.

            It was 40-26 at the half. When Miami opened the second half on a 9-0 run to build a 23-point lead, the outcome quickly became academic.

            “The crowd fueled us to keep it going,” Larrañaga said.

            BIG PICTURE

            Duke: Maybe it’s too difficult to quickly reset after a rivalry game. This is the third consecutive year the Blue Devils have lost the game immediately following their first matchup of the season with North Carolina. “It's tough. It's not easy. But it's what you have to do. ... It's part of playing in the ACC,” Scheyer said.

            Miami: The Hurricanes remained one of six teams from major conferences to be unbeaten at home — the others being Alabama, UCLA, Providence, Iowa State and Duke. Across Division I, 20 teams entered Monday with perfect home marks.

            POLL IMPLICATIONS

            Miami has been in the poll for nine straight weeks, the program’s longest such run since being ranked in each of the first 11 polls of the 2017-18 season — and figures to stay there if it tops Louisville on Saturday. Duke has been out of the AP Top 25 for the last four weeks; the Blue Devils were two slots away in the poll released Monday, behind only Florida Atlantic on the “also receiving votes” list.

            BARRY HONORED

            Basketball Hall of Famer Rick Barry, Miami’s all-time leading scorer, was presented with a customized basketball during a first-half stoppage of play.

(AP) — Miami guard Isaiah Wong pointed to the crowd, waving his arms, asking for noise, asking for the celebration to start.The lead, at that point, was 3-0.Didn’t matter. From start to finish, the Hurricanes were in total control —- and got a rare rout over Duke.Norchad Omier had 17 points and 10 rebounds, Jordan Miller added 16 points and No. 19 Miami never trailed on the way to a 81-59 win over Duke on Monday night.Wooga Poplar scored 14 and Wong scored 11 for Miami (19-5, 10-4 Atlantic Coast Conference). The Hurricanes led by as many as 26 and improved to 13-0 at home.“That was a great performance, from start to finish,” Miami coach Jim Larrañaga said. “There was a lot of energy. And all I can tell you is, everybody who came tonight's game is invited back — because that's the kind of environment that we'd love to have every night.”Ryan Young and Dereck Lively II each scored 11 points for Duke (17-7, 8-5), which saw its three-game winning streak snapped. Jeremy Roach added 10 points for the Blue Devils, who were outrebounded 38-31 and committed 21 turnovers.It was the second game this season where Duke never led, and the 22-point loss was its second-worst this season. The Blue Devils lost to N.C. State by 24 on Jan. 4.“Congratulations to Miami. There's a reason they haven't lost here at home,” Duke coach Jon Scheyer said. “They're really good. They obviously had it clicking on all cylinders right away.”It was the second-biggest Miami victory margin in the series between the schools, topped only by the Hurricanes’ 90-63 win over then-No. 1 Duke on Jan. 23, 2013. Miami also enjoyed huge edges in points off turnovers (23-9), second-chance points (24-9) and fast-break points (17-7).And Miami got payback for a 68-66 loss at Duke earlier this season.“We had something to prove,” Miller said. “They beat us last time. We were revved up for this game and we got it done.”Duke fans started leaving with 4:24 left and Miami up by 26, the Hurricanes’ student section serenading them as they departed.Miami ran out to a 13-1 lead and stretched it to 34-17 later in the first half, putting Duke in unfamiliar territory quickly. The Blue Devils had trailed by more than 15 in just two other games — by 29 to N.C. State, and by 19 to Purdue.“When you have 21 turnovers, you can’t expect yourself to have a good game,” Lively said.It was 40-26 at the half. When Miami opened the second half on a 9-0 run to build a 23-point lead, the outcome quickly became academic.“The crowd fueled us to keep it going,” Larrañaga said.BIG PICTUREDuke: Maybe it’s too difficult to quickly reset after a rivalry game. This is the third consecutive year the Blue Devils have lost the game immediately following their first matchup of the season with North Carolina. “It's tough. It's not easy. But it's what you have to do. ... It's part of playing in the ACC,” Scheyer said.Miami: The Hurricanes remained one of six teams from major conferences to be unbeaten at home — the others being Alabama, UCLA, Providence, Iowa State and Duke. Across Division I, 20 teams entered Monday with perfect home marks.POLL IMPLICATIONSMiami has been in the poll for nine straight weeks, the program’s longest such run since being ranked in each of the first 11 polls of the 2017-18 season — and figures to stay there if it tops Louisville on Saturday. Duke has been out of the AP Top 25 for the last four weeks; the Blue Devils were two slots away in the poll released Monday, behind only Florida Atlantic on the “also receiving votes” list.BARRY HONOREDBasketball Hall of Famer Rick Barry, Miami’s all-time leading scorer, was presented with a customized basketball during a first-half stoppage of play.UP NEXTDuke: Visits No. 8 Virginia on Saturday.Miami: Hosts Louisville on Saturday.___AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/college-basketball and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/2/7,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802499,Taiwan wheelchair exports rank third in the world,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwan, once known as the “kingdom of bicycles,” has taken its expertise in two wheels and branched into related industries like wheelchairs, both traditional and electric-powered models.According to the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) report, Taiwan's wheelchair exports topped US$126.83 million (NT$3.8 billion) in 2022, an annual increase of more than 11.2%.Wheelchairs are officially classified as assistive devices, and may range from manually operated models requiring a nurse or personal assistant to push them to electric models which can be self-operated, and even mobility scooters. As many countries around the world experience an aging population, the potential for this market continues to roll upward.Taiwan is the third largest exporter of wheelchairs in the world, following China and Germany. Growth was constrained in 2020, coinciding with the COVID pandemic, as many hospitals turned to video consultation and tele-medicine with reduced capacity for in-person hospital visits.With the pandemic easing in 2021 and 2022, the export value of wheelchairs has risen. According to the MOEA’s Bureau of Foreign Trade, wheelchairs made in Taiwan are mainly exported to the U.S. and the United Kingdom, which together account for more than 50% of total exports, and exports will show double-digit growth in 2022. Taiwan exports to the U.S. alone hit a new high of US$22 million (NT$661 million).Regarding the distinctions between major exporting countries such as China, Germany, and Taiwan, the MOEA’s Bureau of Trade pointed out that China mainly focuses on the low-price wheelchair market in U.S., Japan, Russian, and ASEAN countries. Whereas Germany is focused on the high-end market with the priciest wheelchairs and primarily supplies the European market.In terms of price, Taiwan finds itself situated between China and Germany. Taiwan-made wheelchairs and accessories are closely aligned with the needs of users and family care. For example, seat design can be adjusted according to the user's body shape. Also, special measures go into quality control and safety should a collision occur.In recent years, Taiwanese factories have invested in the development of lightweight wheelchairs and special mobility aids, with some even using IoT technology to provide feedback to manufacturers on user experience as well as maintenance.",2023/2/7,914,Business

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802527,"Palmieri, Barzal score in win for Isles in Horvat's 1st game","PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Bo Horvat had a new look in his first game with his new team. Yes, of course, the Islanders jersey took some getting used to — Horvat said he was “really nervous” ahead of his debut — but so did New York's ban on facial hair.

            So he made sure to pack his gear — and his razor. Horvat had to say goodbye to his scruff.

            “My face looks like a little boy right now,” he said.











            The Islanders just hope he continues to look like an All-Star.

            Kyle Palmieri and Mathew Barzal scored for the Islanders in their first game since they acquired Horvat in a trade, leading them to a 2-1 win over the Philadelphia Flyers on Monday night.

            Horvat made his debut a day after the Islanders s igned the center to an eight-year contract worth $68 million. The 27-year-old Horvat was chosen as an All-Star and played for the Pacific Division on Saturday. Horvat had already tied his career high with 31 goals this season in 49 games with Vancouver. 

            “The guys made me feel really comfortable and they were great,” Horvat said. “It feels even better to get that win and get my legs under me.”

            Coach Lane Lambert said Horvat can only help as the Islanders make a playoff push in a crowded bottom half of the Eastern Conference. The Islanders now have 57 points and matched the idle Pittsburgh Penguins for eighth in the East.

            “In terms of how it changes moving forward, it gives us more options,” Lambert said. “We know what we have to do as a group. We’ve got to string together some wins. That’s the focus right now.”

            Horvat was a non-factor in New York’s goals. Palmieri scored his seventh on a wrist shot in the first that snapped the Islanders’ 0-for-26 power-play drought. Barzal beat Carter Hart for his 13th goal and a 2-0 lead in the second.

            Noah Dobson earned his 18th assist on Barzal’s goal and collected his 100th career point. He expected Horvat to make an immediate impact.

            “Obviously the caliber of player and person he is going to fit in well with this locker room,” Dobson said.

            Semyon Varlamov stopped 25 shots for the Islanders.

            Nicolas Deslauriers scored his third goal for the Flyers. 

            The Flyers are out of the playoff picture but, perhaps even worse to some fans, are falling out of the race to earn the No. 1 pick and a shot at drafting a projected generational talent in Connor Bedard.

            The Flyers won seven of eight games after Christmas and tacked on another three-game winning streak later in January to earn some needed confidence in coach John Tortorella’s first season.

            There is a no-tank ethos in the no-nonsense Tortorella.

            “I think there’s a right type of camaraderie going on with this club right now,” Tortorella said. “I thought we played our best month of hockey in January. I think it builds the belief. Belief is a very powerful thing if you get it to go from one guy to another and then you get it to a group. I’m hoping that’s the way they feel.”

            The Flyers released a letter on Monday that was signed by Tortorella and sent to season-ticket holders. His mission statement: to effectively let fans know the path toward a Stanley Cup could take some time. Then again, Flyers fans are used to waiting. The franchise has only won Stanley Cups in 1974 and 1975.

            “I’m not going to lie to you – and I want to be clear about this – we’re not there yet,” Tortorella wrote. “This year was the first step in building the future of the Flyers and restoring our reputation as one of the most respected teams in hockey. We’re in the thick of the season right now, and we’re going to see how our group responds to the challenges that lay ahead with a grueling schedule.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802552,"NBA approves sale of Phoenix Suns, Mercury to Mat Ishbia","PHOENIX (AP) — Mortgage executive and former Michigan State guard Mat Ishbia is the new majority owner of the Phoenix Suns and WNBA’s Phoenix Mercury, after the NBA’s board of governors approved his plan to purchase the controlling stake of those franchises from Robert Sarver.

            The league announced the approval Monday night, saying the transaction will be finalized later this week. The vote was 29-0, with the Cleveland Cavaliers abstaining, according to a person who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the final decision had not yet been announced publicly.

            Ishbia agreed on Dec. 20 to the deal, one that put the total value of the Suns and Mercury at $4 billion. Ishbia and his brother Justin said then that they would be acquiring more than 50% of the franchises, which includes the entirety of the embattled Sarver’s share as well as some holdings from minority partners.











            Mat Ishbia will be the Suns’ governor, Justin Ishbia will be alternate governor. They now can assume those roles just days before Thursday’s NBA trade deadline, and with the Suns squarely in the middle of the Western Conference playoff race.

            There are tentative plans to introduce Mat Ishbia on Wednesday at a news conference in Phoenix.

            No other sale in NBA history has been completed with a $4 billion valuation of the franchise involved. Joe Tsai bought the Brooklyn Nets and Barclays Center for $3.3 billion in 2019, and Tilman Fertitta purchased the Houston Rockets for $2.2 billion in 2017.

            The sale was finalized hours after Jason Rowley — who was the Suns president and CEO — decided to leave the team in anticipation of the leadership changes, a person familiar with the matter told AP. That person, speaking on condition of anonymity because Rowley’s resignation was not shared outside of the organization, said Rowley’s departure was “shared internally” within the Suns organization on Monday.

            Mat Ishbia is the chairman, president and chief executive of United Wholesale Mortgage, which bills itself as the nation’s largest mortgage lender. He had to successfully complete a vetting process by the NBA before the transaction could be finalized, and then the league’s other owners cast their ballots for or against the move.

            Forbes recently listed his net worth as just over $5 billion. Ishbia's company went public in January 2021 and is a rival to Quicken Loans — the company that has Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert as its founder and chairman.

            Ishbia played at Michigan State under coach Tom Izzo and was a member of the Spartans’ NCAA championship team in 2000.

            The NBA suspended Sarver in September for one year, plus fined him $10 million, after an investigation found he had engaged in what the league called “workplace misconduct and organizational deficiencies.”

            The punishment came nearly a year after the NBA asked a law firm to investigate allegations that Sarver had a history of racist, misogynistic and hostile incidents over his nearly two-decade tenure overseeing the franchise.

            Shortly afterward, Sarver announced he would be looking to sell the Suns and the Mercury. He bought the Suns in 2004 for $401 million, which at the time was an NBA record.

            Ishbia has been mentioned before as a possible buyer of pro franchises — the NFL’s Washington Commanders, among them — and he is a prominent Michigan State donor.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802553,"Clippers surge late, overcome Thomas' 47 to top Nets 124-116","NEW YORK (AP) — Paul George scored 29 points, Kawhi Leonard added 24 and the Los Angeles Clippers overcame a career-high 47 points from Cam Thomas in his first start to beat the short-handed Brooklyn Nets 124-116 on Monday night. 

            Ivica Zubac added 19 points and 12 rebounds for the Clippers, who won for the eighth time in 10 games and finished 4-2 on their six-game Eastern Conference road trip.

            “I’m happy with the road trip we had,” Leonard said. “We came out 4-2, and that’s a pretty good road trip for us.”











            Thomas, who scored 44 to rally the Nets past Washington on Saturday, was even better on the day the Nets completed the trade that sent Kyrie Irving to Dallas. But Los Angeles outscored Brooklyn 25-9 over the final 6:20.

            “Their objective (was) to come in and play hard and go hard, and they did that,” George said. “I thought it was a good experience for us to get good possessions down the stretch.”

            Nic Claxton had 15 points and 15 rebounds for the Nets, while Edmond Sumner chipped in 23 points for Brooklyn. Before the game, the deal that sent Irving and forward Markieff Morris to Dallas for Spencer Dinwiddie, Dorian Finney-Smith and multiple draft picks was announced.

            Neither Dinwiddie nor Finney-Smith were available, nor were stars Kevin Durant and Ben Simmons and guard Seth Curry due to injury, leaving coach Jacque Vaughn forced to rotate 11 of his 12 dressed players

            “You just got to give credit to our group for being ready to play,” Vaughn said. “The optimism and belief that we can win a basketball game with the group we had was (good) to see, and our overall effort and energy and communication was good throughout the night.”

            Still, Los Angeles’ bench still outscored Brooklyn’s 38-10.

            “That’s huge,” Clippers coach Tyronn Lue said. “We have a really good bench that we really trust, and you saw that tonight, increasing the lead when (George) and Kawhi went to the bench in the first half. ... We really lean on those guys to be good for us.”

            But Thomas almost single-handedly kept Brooklyn within striking distance. Thomas had 22 in the first half, then electrified the crowd with a combination of 3-pointers and mid-range jumpers, helping Brooklyn lead by 107-99 midway through the fourth.

            “I came out hot early,” Thomas said. “I didn’t know it’d be another 40, but I knew I’d probably have a great game again. Kudos to the guys for believing in me and letting me make decisions down the stretch.”

            Los Angeles rallied with a 9-0 run and outscored Brooklyn 33-28 in the fourth, keyed by Leonard’s nine points in the frame.

            “Defensively we were able to get some stops and get out in transition a little bit,” Lue said. “Being down eight, we just came out settled down and came out and went on the 9-0 run and took control of the game.” 

            The Nets made 8 of 12 first-quarter 3-pointers and built an eight-point advantage. But the Clippers closed the first with a 10-0 run then George then scored nine in the second, helping the Clippers build an 11-point advantage. 

            But the Nets closed the half with a 13-4 run, cutting Los Angeles’ lead to 55-53 at halftime.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802555,Portland makes its pitch for expansion WNBA franchise,"PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert says she last visited Portland a few years back and watched a women's game between Oregon and Oregon State. She was struck by fans who were “rocking the house that night.""

            So it's no surprise that Portland is a potential destination for a WNBA expansion team.

            Engelbert was the guest of Sen. Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, at an event Monday to demonstrate community support for a team.











            “The first thing when I came in, I said, ‘Ok, we have 12 teams in a country of over 300 million people. That is not enough,’” Engelbert said. “So that’s why we do talk about expansion, and you have to be in more cities to grow more fandom. So that leads me to be here today.” 

            Among those trying to persuade the commissioner that Portland would be a good fit were Oregon women's coach Kelly Graves, Oregon State women's coach Scott Rueck and representatives from the NBA's Portland Trail Blazers and the Portland Thorns of the National Women's Soccer League. 

            Portland previously had a WNBA team, the Portland Fire, which played three seasons before folding in 2002. The late Paul Allen, owner of the Blazers, declined to buy the Fire when the NBA sold ownership of WNBA franchises.

            The WNBA was launched in 1997 with eight teams. The most recent expansion team was the Atlanta Dream, which began playing in 2008.

            Engelbert said last year her hope was to expand by two more teams to start in 2025 at the latest.

            Among the other cities considered candidates for a new franchise are Toronto, Philadelphia, San Francisco and Nashville, Tennessee. The Chicago Sky and Minnesota Lynx will play a preseason game in Toronto on May 13. 

            “We would love to see the WNBA come to Portland and we would be right behind it to make sure that it was a success, and we would support it. We just feel really good about about that partnership and the conversations that we’ve been having,"" said Dewayne Hankins, the Blazers' president of business operations.

            Monday's event was hosted by The Sports Bra, hailed as the country's first sports bar dedicated solely to women's sports. Owner Jenny Nguyen hosted the event.

The Chicago Sky and Minnesota Lynx will play a preseason game in Toronto on May 13.“We would love to see the WNBA come to Portland and we would be right behind it to make sure that it was a success, and we would support it. We just feel really good about about that partnership and the conversations that we’ve been having,"" said Dewayne Hankins, the Blazers' president of business operations.Monday's event was hosted by The Sports Bra, hailed as the country's first sports bar dedicated solely to women's sports.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802556,Super Bowl opening night returns with energetic atmosphere,"PHOENIX (AP) — Nick Sirianni answered questions about Rocky, Santa Claus and even which of his players on the Philadelphia Eagles he’d want to date his 5-year-old daughter when she grows up.

            Welcome to Super Bowl opening night where football talk gives way to the wild and wacky. 

            The circus atmosphere that kicks off the NFL’s biggest week returned Monday for the first time since 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic forced teams to meet the media on video conferences the past two seasons.











            Sirianni and the Eagles took the stage first at Footprint Center, home of the Phoenix Suns. “Fly, Eagles, Fly” chants greeted players and coaches before they spent an hour answering wide-ranging questions from more than 2,000 media members.

            Red-clad Chiefs fans took over the arena when Kansas City came out, turning it into an indoor version of Arrowhead Stadium.

            It was a new experience for many of the Eagles, who have seven holdovers from the team that beat New England in the Super Bowl five years ago.

            Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs are here for the third time in four years so they already got a taste of this media extravaganza in Miami in 2020. 

            For the record, Sirianni loves the Rocky movies. He identifies with Sylvester Stallone’s fictional movie character, who is part of Philadelphia’s fabric as much as the cheesesteak.

            “I live and coach in the greatest sports town in America,” Sirianni said. “It means so much to everybody there. That’s what you want. When you’re a little kid playing in a peewee football game, you want everybody to see you. You want your fans to love it. You want them to be there. You want them wearing green on Friday. You want them to be throwing snowballs at Santa Claus. You want to put talent on display in front of the greatest sports town in America. I love the fact that my kids are growing up in a sports town where football means so much because football means so much to me.”

            Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts, an AP NFL MVP finalist, drew the largest crowd in the early portion. Reporters staked out his spot about an hour before the event started. The first question came from Hall of Fame wide receiver Michael Irvin, an NFL Network analyst.

            “I feel like it’s not a time to reflect,” Hurts said about his journey to stardom. “We came here to finish the job.” 

            Chiefs coach Andy Reid got numerous questions about his time in Philadelphia and food. The cheeseburger fanatic would not name his favorite city to eat outside of Kansas City, Green Bay and Philly.

            “They won’t let you back in if I do,” he said.

            Overall, opening night wasn’t quite as outrageous as past years. 

            In Arizona in 2008, a female reporter showed up wearing a white wedding dress and veil and proposed to Tom Brady, who was trying to lead the Patriots to the first 19-0 season in NFL history.

            One radio host walked around shirtless wearing a barrel. A television reporter from Mexico asked people to play pin the tail on the donkey and then asked them to toss foam footballs into a basket. Some of the Eagles cheerleaders participated.

            Otherwise, it was more about odd questions than odd looks.

            Someone asked Mahomes and Sirianni if this was a “must-win game.”

            Both said yes in the most polite way possible.

            “The job is not finished,” said Mahomes, who is also an MVP finalist.

            Mahomes got the loudest ovation of the night.

            Oh, his favorite song of all time is Rihanna’s “Umbrella.” Rihanna will be the halftime performer but he won’t be watching.

            “Coach Reid said if we go out there to watch to just keep walking,” Mahomes said.

            The Eagles (16-3) and Chiefs (16-3) meet on Sunday, both aiming for their second Super Bowl title within five years.

            Perhaps the most anxious person in the stadium will be Donna Kelce, mom of All-Pros Jason and Travis.

            Donna Kelce, who took part in some of the night’s festivities on stage, wore a jersey that was half-green for Jason’s Eagles and half-red for Travis’ Chiefs. She had No. 87 for Travis on the front and No. 62 for Jason on the back.

            Who is the biggest momma’s boy?

            Donna held up a photo of Travis.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802557,Tkachuk's 5-point night leads Panthers over Lightning 7-1,"SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) — Two days after being named MVP of the NHL All-Star Game on home ice, Matthew Tkachuk had a five-point night with two goals as the Florida Panthers beat the Tampa Bay Lightning 7-1 on Monday night. 

            Tkachuk, who was also named NHL First Star of the Week for his All-Star performance, had a hand in the first three goals for the Panthers.

            “I’m tired now,” Tkachuk said. “It is definitely a long weekend. I know people think it’s fun and stuff, but there is a lot going on. I had an unreal time this weekend and there’s nothing better than coming back, seeing the guys … and we’re really looking forward to a good home stretch to end the year.” 











            His five-point night also made him the fifth player in the NHL to hit 70 points this season as he surpassed Jonathan Huberdeau for most points in franchise history through the first 50 games of a season. 

            Huberdeau had 70 in 50 last season — and then was traded to Calgary for Tkachuk.

            Both teams were coming off their All-Star break with Florida goalie Sergei Bobrovsky looking sharp with 32 saves after being out since Jan. 19 after he was hurt in Montreal. 

            “It is nice to have a big-number win like that to feel good,” Florida coach Paul Maurice said. “We had an emotional win against Boston and couldn’t build off it because everyone left town. To come back and bookend it with a win, that’s a positive direction.’’

            Aside from Tkachuk, Florida also got a pair of goals from former Tampa Bay forward Carter Verhaeghe as well as goals from Sam Bennett, Eetu Luostarinen and Eric Staal in the win. Andrei Vasilevskiy had 42 saves for Tampa Bay. 

            Tampa Bay made it a 2-1 game 3:02 into the second on a goal from All-Star Nikita Kucherov. 

            Florida opened the scoring in the third meeting between the two in-state rivals at 8:04 of the first when Verhaeghe cashed in on a nice feed from Tkachuk. 

            Bennett gave Florida a two-goal lead 1:42 into the second as he found himself all alone in front of Vasilevskiy and took a pass from Tkachuk who was behind the net. The Panthers scored two more before the end of the period.

            Tkachuk scored on a incredible shot in which he pulled down a rebound from a Verhaeghe shot out of the air with his stick — then batted it past Vasilevskiy. 

            “You just don’t see that,” Maurice said. “I have a pretty good understanding of Matthew as a player because he scored a lot of goals against us (in Winnipeg). But you have to see it every day before you get a true understanding of what he can do with pucks in midair. He is an elite, elite talent.”

            The Panthers opened the scoring in the third period to turn this one into a rout as Staal scored at 2:53, with Verhaeghe getting his second just under three minutes later. 

            Tkachuk got his second of the night with 6:37 left.

            “I don’t want to say we’re still on vacation, but their will to win was a little bit stronger than ours,” Tampa Bay coach Jon Cooper said. “They seemed to be OK and we were not. I think it was too easy a night for them in our own zone and that result happened.”

            NOTES: Florida was without captain Aleksander Barkov for the second half of the game Monday night after he appeared to get struck in the hand area with a shot. Barkov, who joined Tkachuk at the All-Star Game, left with 8:04 remaining in the second period. Barkov’s career-high 11-game scoring streak ended as fifth-longest in franchise history. Maurice said Barkov would likely not practice Tuesday but could return Thursday against San Jose. … The Panthers sent goalie Alex Lyon back to their AHL team in Charlotte after he played in all six of their games leading into the All-Star break. Florida activated Bobrovsky off injured reserve.

            Jesper Bratt scored on a power play with 43 seconds left in overtime and the Devils beat the Vancouver Canucks 5-4 on Monday night after squandering a three-goal lead.

            “I just think we got lucky,” Ruff said after the Devils improved to 9-1-1 in their last 11 games. “I think the last 10 minutes of the third period that it was all Vancouver. I’m not going to sugarcoat anything. They had two or three opportunities, they could have won the game. I feel like we got lucky.”











            Not only did the Devils blow a 4-1 lead, they failed to convert on a 37-second two-man advantage in the third period after the Canucks tied the game at 4-all. They needed another power play in overtime to improve to 9-4 in overtime this season.

            New Jersey has gone to overtime six of the last seven games, winning five of them.

            “We know we’re really good hockey team now,"" said Jack Hughes, who scored his 34th and 35th goals of the season and set up Bratt's game winner. “We got a good squad so I mean, I don’t know if it’s adversity or anything like that. We just got to play the full 60 minutes and we’ve been doing it, but tonight was a little bit of an off night but we came out the win.”

            Ondrej Palat also scored two goals apiece and Vitek Vanecek made 26 saves in winning his 10th straight game for New Jersey.

            Andrei Kuzmenko, Luke Schenn, Curtis Lazar and Phillip Di Giuseppe scored for the Canucks, who were playing for the first time since trading captain and leading goal scorer Bo Horvat to the Islanders during the All-Star breeak for Anthony Beauvillier, Aatu Raty and a conditional 2023 first round pick.

            “I thought we played a pretty darn good game on the road after the break,"" Canucks center J.T. Miller said. “We had a lot of heart today, a lot of pride, character as a team. I think that’s a really good hockey team over there and we easily could have quit at 4-1.”

            Collin Delia made 29 saves for Vancouver, but he had no chance on the one-time by Bratt, who was set up by a cross-ice pass by Hughes. Delia had stopped Hughes on an overtime breakaway.

            “I didn’t get a good read on it,"" Delia said of Bratt's 20th goal. “I need to beat that on my feet so I can get a sightline on it. I went to slide there and I didn’t see the release. You just beat me high glove.”

            The Devils seemed to be in control when Palat twice scored and Hughes once in a 50 second span midway through the second period to stake New Jersey to a 4-1 lead.

            The Canucks, who have worked hard for new coach Rick Tocchet, clawed their way back. Schenn scored on a point shot with 4:31 left in the second period and Lazar tallied in close with 27 seconds to go.

            Di Giuseppe knotted the game at 4-all at 6:02 on a 2-on-1 chance.

            Kuzmenko gave the Canucks the lead 3:35 after the opening faceoff with a great move and shot. Hughes tied the contest, beating Delia with a backhander in close on a 1-on-1 chance.

            NOTES: The Devils won both games in the season series, posting a 5-2 decision in Vancouver in November. ... Beauvillier skated on the Canucks top line with Elias Pettersson at center and Andrei Kuzmenko on left wing. ... Devils D John Marino played for the first time since Dec. 20. He missed 17 games with an upper body injury.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802583,Murray hits eight 3-pointers as Kings beat Rockets 140-120,"HOUSTON (AP) — Keegan Murray had a career-high 30 points and set a franchise rookie record with eight 3-pointers to help the Sacramento Kings snap a two-game skid with a 140-120 win over the Houston Rockets on Monday night. 

            The fourth overall pick in last year’s NBA draft, Murray shot 8 for 12 from beyond the arc on a night when the Kings made 21 3-pointers. The previous team mark for 3s by a rookie was set by Ricky Berry with seven in 1989.

            Murray went 1 for 16 on 3-pointers over his past three games. 











            “Nothing changed there except the ball going in,” Murray said. “I just found a rhythm and when you see the ball going in early, it helps a lot.”

            Sacramento coach Mike Brown was pleased to see Murray break out of what he called a “mini-slump."" 

            “We just think he’s that good of a shooter and he’s capable,” Brown said. “Now, I’m not saying he’s going to go 8 for 12 every night, but we’ve seen Keegan shooting the ball at a high high level this year and so it’s not surprising when it happens.” 

            Malik Monk added 20 points off the bench and Domantas Sabonis had 17 points, seven rebounds and 10 assists in the first of consecutive games between the teams. 

            De’Aaron Fox had 16 points and eight assists for Sacramento after missing two games for the birth of his son, named Reign. 

            “It’s huge to have somebody like that out and it’s good to have him back,” Monk said. 

            Jalen Green had 27 points for the Rockets, who dropped their third straight. 

            An angry Stephen Silas lamented his team's defensive play.

            “They’re not giving the effort on the defensive end,” the Houston coach said. “They’re not getting after it like they’re supposed to.” 

            The Kings led by 12 with about eight minutes remaining before using a 10-2 run to push it to 117-97 midway through the fourth quarter. Monk started that stretch with two free throws and ended it with back-to-back 3s. 

            Eric Gordon made a basket for Houston after that, but Monk hit another 3 to make it 120-99. 

            The Kings were up by 12 after a layup by Kevin Huerter with 8 1/2 minutes left in the third quarter. Houston then used a 14-7 run to get within 81-76 midway through the period. 

            Gordon hit two 3-pointers in that span and Jabari Smith Jr. had a 3 and a dunk to help the Rockets close the gap. 

            But Murray made consecutive 3-pointers to start a 9-4 run, capped by a third 3 from him, to push the lead to 90-80 with 3 1/2 minutes left in the third. 

            A layup by Green got Houston within six with less than a minute left in the third but the Kings scored the last five points of the quarter, with a 3 from Monk, to take a 99-88 lead into the fourth. 

            TIP-INS

            Kings: Kevin Huerter had 16 points. Trey Lyles added 14 off the bench. ... Sacramento shot 58.4% from the field. 

            Rockets: Kevin Porter Jr. missed his 13th consecutive game with a left big toe injury. Silas said Porter is struggling with the injury and it's unclear when he’ll return. … Kenyon Martin Jr. had 18 points and eight rebounds. Gordon scored 16. ... Alperen Sengun had 15 points, seven rebounds and seven assists. 

            THINKING OF HOME

            Sengun, who is from Turkey, said it was tough to concentrate on the game after a 7.8 magnitude earthquake killed more than 4,000 people in Turkey and Syria on Monday. 

            He said his family lives far from where the earthquake hit and they were OK, but he worried about many others in the country. 

            “Of course I was thinking about all of my country today all day,” Sengun said. “But I know I have a job over here.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802584,"Vucevic, Drummond come up big, Bulls beat Spurs 128-104","CHICAGO (AP) — Nikola Vucevic could be playing for another team by the end of the week. The same goes for Andre Drummond as the NBA's trade deadline approaches.

            Despite big questions about their futures, the big men delivered in a big way for the Chicago Bulls on Monday night.

            Vucevic had 22 points and 12 rebounds, Drummond set season highs with 21 points and 15 rebounds, and Chicago handed San Antonio its ninth straight loss, beating the Spurs 128-104.











            “I never take this game lightly,” Drummond said. “I appreciate every moment that I am on that floor. I don’t take those moments lightly. When I get that chance, I just try to play as hard as I can and give it all I have.”

            Zach LaVine scored 20 points and DeMar DeRozan had 19, helping the Bulls match a season high with their third straight win. Chicago (26-27) also got some payback for a loss at San Antonio in October.

            It was tied at 85 late in the third quarter when Chicago went on a 23-3 run that buried the team with the second-worst record in the Western Conference. Two more losses and the Spurs will match their worst skid of the season.

            BULLS DOMINATE

            With his second double-double in three games after being used sparingly, Drummond continued to make his case for more playing time. The two-time All-Star had three steals in 21 minutes and scored 10 points in Chicago's game-breaking burst, including back-to-back dunks that delighted the crowd.

            “It says a lot about him,” said Vucevic, whom the Bulls might deal rather than risk losing as a free agent after this season. “It shows how truly professional he is. When you're not playing, when you're not in the rotation, sometimes it's harder to stay focused. He's been doing that this season.”

            DeRozan started the decisive run with a three-point play and step-back jumper in the final minute of the third, giving the Bulls a five-point lead.

            Chicago had seven players score in double figures and shot 56.2% despite making just 6 of 22 3-pointers. It was the Bulls' fourth win in five games overall.

            Keldon Johnson led San Antonio with 21 points. But the Spurs opened a season-high, nine-game trip on an all-too-familiar note.

            PULLING AWAY

            The Bulls led by 11 after the first quarter, only to have San Antonio get back into the game in the second. The Spurs led by four late in the third, before the Bulls steadied themselves.

            DeRozan's spurt at the end of the quarter helped give the Bulls the spark they needed.

            Coby White kept it going when he hit two free throws and fed Drummond for dunk after stealing a pass in the opening minute of the fourth. Doug McDermott hit a 3 for San Antonio, but the Bulls outscored the Spurs 38-19 in the quarter.

            TIP-INS

            Spurs: San Antonio had won four of five against Chicago. ... F Jeremy Sochan (sore lower back) and G Tre Jones (sore left foot) missed their second consecutive game. 

            Bulls: The Bulls' 39 first-quarter points were one shy of their season high. ... G Alex Caruso (sore left foot) missed his second straight game.

            During the incident, which occurred at about 11:30 a.m. Monday, “a man gained unauthorized access to a JBA housing area,” Joint Base Andrews said in a statement posted to Twitter. “A resident discharged a firearm, security forces arrived on scene to apprehend the intruder and law enforcement is investigating the incident.” 

            Joint Base Andrews is home to the fleet of blue and white presidential aircraft, including Air Force One and the “doomsday” 747 aircraft that can serve as the nation's airborne nuclear command and control centers if needed.











            The Air Force said late Monday it did not have anything to add beyond the Andrews statement about Monday’s intrusion.

            It's not the first time the base's security has been breached; in February 2021 a man got through the military checkpoint onto the installation, then through additional fenced secure areas to gain access to the flight line and climb into a C-40, which is the military's 737-equivalent aircraft used to fly government officials. 

            That intruder was apprehended because the “mouse ears” cap he was wearing struck an observant airman as odd. 

            An inspector general's investigation found three main security failings, starting with “human error” by a gate security guard who allowed the man to drive onto the base even though he had no credentials that authorized his access. Hours later, the man walked undetected onto the flight line by slipping through a fence designed to restrict entry. Finally, he walked onto and off a parked airplane without being challenged, even though he was not wearing a required badge authorizing access to the restricted area.

            Now, there's the Simu Liu Sensory Room, complete with carpeted walls, lighting features, puzzles and games to provide a quiet space for guests who might feel overwhelmed or overstimulated. The Chinese Canadian actor who starred in the 2021 film “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings” helped unveil the renovated room before the Golden State Warriors hosted the Oklahoma City Thunder on Monday night.

            “Pretty neat. It's simple. It's perfect,” Liu said. “What an incredible opportunity that we've given so many fans that ordinarily would have only dreamt of coming to Chase Center to watch the Golden State Warriors play.”











            Built with support from KultureCity, a nonprofit that advocates for acceptance of those with “invisible disabilities,” the spot also can be used by nursing mothers, complete with a fridge to store milk. The space includes noise cancellation and activities and lights to help calm the mind.

            Through therapy and taking note of how he is feeling, Liu has addressed his own mental health and wants to use his platform to advocate and show care for others going through difficult times. 

            “Obviously it goes without saying that I've really come to understand the importance of mental health and looking after one's mental health. It starts with something as simple as burnout and then it can spiral quickly into feelings of anxiety, feelings of depression. For some people, the solution to those ailments and those issues is as simple as seeing somebody, seeking professional help and getting therapy. And that's what I did and it was immensely helpful,” Liu said.

            The 33-year-old Liu said it might seem “unfathomable” for people with sensory issues to feel they can come to a game, but that the new calming space could help ease that burden.

            “There's an overstimulation of the senses and sometimes you just need a place that's nice and quiet and it's as simple as just coming here for a few minutes, calming down, looking at some of the lights and taking a breath and taking a moment,” he said.

AmCham surveyed members between Nov. 15 and Dec. 16, 2022, showing 85% of respondents felt confident about Taiwan’s economic outlook over the next three years.Confidence aside, AmCham called on Taiwan to speed up deregulation in order to set the conditions for a Taiwan-U.S. free trade agreement. “Taiwan requires a faster pace of economic reform and international economic engagement if it is to build the resilience needed to prosper,” AmCham said.While nearly 90% of AmCham members said they planned to maintain or increase investment in Taiwan, over a third said they would like to see less regulation in the economy.“Respondents identified regulations and policies as the most important area for improvement of Taiwan’s business climate,” AmCham said. Some respondents said they felt Taiwan’s laws and regulations have not been updated in response to changing societal and economic needs, and that regulations are interpreted inconsistently.“As sound regulatory practices are a focus area of the U.S.-Taiwan Initiative on 21st-Century Trade, AmCham recommends the government consider the Chamber’s constructive criticism and strive to establish a more investment-friendly regulatory environment,” the report said.Cross-strait relations were less of a concern for respondents. “67 percent reported no significant disruption by increased tensions across the Taiwan Strait during the second half of 2022,” AmCham said, but noted that nearly half of businesses surveyed have updated business continuity plans to address the new geopolitical climate.Over half of the companies surveyed have formally committed to achieving net-zero carbon emissions, 100% renewable energy, or “similar initiatives,” however the report did not explain what those initiatives were. Despite making this commitment, some respondents reported concerns about the availability of green energy sources in Taiwan.",2023/2/7,449,Business
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802597,Young Taiwan couple dead in murder-suicide,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A dispute between a young couple led to a tragic murder-suicide scene in Chiayi City on Monday night (Feb. 6), leaving neighbors shocked.


            A 27-year-old man surnamed Wang (汪) was suspected of killing his girlfriend surnamed Li (李). After committing the crime, he drove north and returned to his residence in Bade District, Taoyuan City, where he supposedly jumped to his death from the 19th floor, according to UDN.

            Police at the Bade Precinct reported the finding to the Taoyuan District Prosecutor's Office to clarify the cause of death, which they suspect is a crime of passion that is currently being investigated by Chiayi police.











            Chiayi Police Department received a report around 10:30 p.m. that a man and a woman were heard quarreling in a parking lot in the city’s eastern district. When the police arrived at the scene, they found Li lying in the grass adjacent to the parking lot, with her face covered in blood.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802602,Lucky player in Seattle suburb wins $754.6M Powerball prize,"AUBURN, Wash. (AP) — A single winning ticket for a $754.6 million Powerball jackpot was sold at a department store in a Seattle suburb, Washington state lottery officials said Tuesday.

            The winning numbers drawn Monday night were 5, 11, 22, 23, 69 and the Powerball 7.

            The winning ticket was bought Sunday at a Fred Meyer store in Auburn, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) south of Seattle, lottery officials said. The store will receive a $50,000 bonus.











            The winner has not yet come forward.

            It’s the second time a Powerball jackpot ticket was sold in Washington state, and both tickets were purchased in Auburn. The first was a $90 million jackpot in 2014.

            Lottery officials said another $1 million prize from a ticket bought in Airway Heights, near Spokane, in November remains unclaimed. Lottery winners have 180 days to claim their prizes.

            Powerball officials said in a statement early Tuesday that a single ticket matched all six numbers and that ticket sales pushed the jackpot higher than an earlier $747 million estimate.

            The full jackpot is for a winner opting for an annuity distributed in one immediate but partial payout followed by additional payments over 29 years that increase by 5% annually. The winner also can opt for a one-time cash payment of $407.2 million.

            Both prizes available are the amounts before taxes, Powerball said.

            The estimated jackpot for the next drawing scheduled for Wednesday is $20 million, according to the lottery's website.

            Monday night's win was the first Powerball jackpot win since Nov. 19. That winless streak allowed the prize to grow larger and larger until it became the ninth-largest in U.S. history.

            Higher interest rates have allowed annuity payments to increase compared with earlier jackpots, when rates were lower. Most winners prefer the immediate cash prize.

            The game’s abysmal odds of 1 in 292.2 million are designed to build big prizes that draw more players. That strategy certainly has worked recently: Someone in Maine won a $1.35 billion Mega Millions prize in January and a California player hit a record $2.04 billion Powerball jackpot last November. No one has claimed either of those prizes.

            Powerball is played in 45 states, as well as Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802604,Lafreniere scores in OT to lift Rangers over Flames 5-4,"NEW YORK (AP) — Alexis Lafreniere scored 1:37 into overtime and Jaroslav Halak made 28 saves as the New York Rangers beat the Calgary Flames 5-4 on Monday night.

            Lafreniere led a 2-on-1 rush and then tracked down the rebound of Mika Zibanejad's shot, beating netminder Jacob Markstrom for his seventh goal this season. That ended a frenzied game that was tied four times and featured several fights following big hits — two by Rangers captain Jacob Trouba. 

            “Getting the game-winning goal in OT is always fun,'' the 21-year-old Lafreniere said. ”It was a great up-and-down game with two really good goalies. It was fun to play.""











            Calgary’s Andrew Mangiapane and Michael Stone scored two minutes apart early in the third period to give the Flames a 4-3 lead, but Zibanejad scored his second goal of the game — his team-leading 24th — to tie it for the fourth time at 12:55. 

            Filip Chytil also scored twice for the Rangers, who improved to 9-2-3 in their last 14 games and are 17-4-3 since Dec. 5. 

            Halak has won six straight and seven of his last eight appearances. 

            Zibanejad put New York ahead 3-2 with 14 seconds left in the second but Mangiapane scored at 6:38 of the third to tie it. The play was reviewed to determine if Mangiapane kicked in the puck with his skate, but the goal stood.

            “It wasn't pretty at times. ... It was a hard battle. We just kept going,'' Zibanejad said. ""It was a big two points and a great way to come back from the break.""

            Zibanejad's first goal came as he roofed the puck past Markstrom on the power play with assists to Chris Kreider and Artemi Panarin. The assist was Panarin’s 300th point with the Rangers.

            Chytil opened the scoring at 5:37 of the first, rifling a high shot past Markstrom. Kaapo Kakko and Adam Fox assisted. 

            Calgary forward Blake Coleman tied it at 10:25 with his 11th goal.

            There were several skirmishes in the first as both teams were playing for the first time since Jan. 27 following the All-Star break. 

            “It wasn't a great hockey game, but it was an exciting game,'' Rangers coach Gerard Gallant said. ""It was different — a bunch of fights going on. ... Maybe the break was too short."" 

            Trouba tussled with Calgary’s Chris Tanev after the defenseman leveled Flames forward Dillon Dube with an open-ice check.

            Later in the first, several fights ensued after Rangers forward Sammy Blais drilled Flames forward Milan Lucic. New York rookie Will Cuylle fought Calgary’s MacKenzie Weegar, and Lucic was assessed an extra two minutes for roughing against Rangers forward Jake Leschyshyn.

            “Exciting game. Fun game. I thought we were valiant to come back,"" Flames coach Darryl Sutter said. “I thought we played really well. ... There were three or four hits. They were clean, big hits.”

            Chytil put the Rangers ahead 2-1 on a breakaway at 2:02 of the second. Fans at Madison Square Garden chanted the 23-year-old Czech forward's name after his second goal.

            “That’s cool, feels very good,” he said. “It motivates me to be better the next shift and show what I can do.""

            Chytil has a career-best 18 goals and 31 points this season. He has six goals in his last four games and 14 points — 10 goals — in his last 12 games.

            Calgary’s Tyler Toffoli tied it at 2 with his 19th goal on the power play at 16:45 of the second.

            Trouba struck again with just under a minute left in the second, body-checking Nazem Kadri hard in the Rangers zone, then fighting Dube who rushed to his teammate's defense. Dube received an extra two-minute penalty for instigating, and Zibanejad scored the go-ahead goal on the ensuing power play.

            NOTES: Zibanejad’s 83rd power-play goal for the Rangers moved him ahead of Phil Esposito and Jean Ratelle into a tie with Vic Hadfield for sixth place on the franchise list. … Calgary scratched defensemen Dennis Gilbert and Connor Mackey, plus forward Brett Ritchie. … The Rangers scratched forwards Julien Gauthier and Vitali Kravtsov, plus defenseman Libor Hajek. ...

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802606,Netflix spatial audio powered by Sennheiser,"Streaming giant chooses AMBEO 2-Channel Spatial Audio for its enhanced Premium plan

 WEDEMARK, GERMANY -  Media OutReach - 7 February 2023 - Netflix has announced a series of brand-new features for members on its Premium plan, including Netflix spatial audio. Starting from February 1st, members on Netflix's Premium plan using a stereo system will experience immersive cinematic audio on more than 700 top titles – all on their existing hardware. Netflix spatial audio is powered by Sennheiser's AMBEO 2-Channel Spatial Audio technology.       Collage courtesy of Netflix     Developed in partnership with Netflix, this Sennheiser technology delivers an unrivalled immersive experience over stereo speakers while fully respecting the creative intent of the original surround or immersive mix. Netflix members do not need any additional hardware to experience this new benefit.   Renato Pellegrini, Manager Pro Labs, AMBEO Immersive Audio: ""We are very pleased that Netflix has expanded its partnership with Sennheiser and has chosen to roll out our game-changing AMBEO 2-Channel Spatial Audio experience to more of its catalog.""   New Surround to 2-Channel Rendering   In addition to content mixed for Dolby Atmos®, Netflix's spatial audio catalog will also include non-Atmos® surround content. ""As a brand-new feature, the AMBEO 2-Channel Spatial Audio renderer is now also able to process surround mixes, unlocking huge catalogs of content available in these formats,"" shares Pellegrini. ""For members on Netflix's Premium plan, this means they will be able to enjoy more of their favorite content immersively, however they watch.""   Respectful Rendering   As a company that counts many mix and (re-)recording engineers among its customers, Sennheiser takes audio quality and mixer intent seriously. AMBEO 2-Channel Spatial Audio rendering was created hand-in-hand with mixers and provides them with granular control of the amount of spatialization.   A preview tool allows mixers to compare standard stereo to AMBEO and adjust rendering settings by individual stems or groups. Specific stems, such as dialog, can be completely excluded from spatialization and music mixes can be kept on their left and right channels while immersive rendering is applied to any other stems. The renderer seeks to translate mixer intent while giving an impressive immersive audio experience previously inaccessible on two speakers.          Hear the difference at          https://youtu.be/0RMh2LnJeGY      Experience It Today   Members on Netflix's Premium plan can experience AMBEO 2-Channel Spatial Audio on hundreds of Netflix's most popular titles, including  Stranger Things,  The Watcher,  Wednesday, and  Knives Out: Glass Onion. Netflix will add forthcoming titles, such as  You,  Your Place or Mine, and  Luther: The Fallen Sun.

            Gradey Dick scored 21 points, Harris had 17 points, six rebounds and five assists, and the ninth-ranked Jayhawks held on after blowing a 14-point first-half lead to beat the Longhorns 88-80 and tighten the league race.











            Kevin McCullar Jr. added 16 points, Joseph Yesufu scored 14 off the bench and KJ Adams finished with 10, helping the Jayhawks (19-5, 7-4) overcome an off night from Jalen Wilson. The league's leading scorer at 21.5 points per game battled foul trouble and was held to just two, ending his streak of 25 straight double-figure games.

            “We knew we had to come in here and get a win,” said Dick, who had the Jayhawks' only two 3-pointers. “The big thing, just in preparation for the week, was coming out with energy. When we do that, we're a scary team.""

            The Jayhawks needed everyone's help holding off the Longhorns' Marcus Carr.

            The Minnesota transfer, who had a game-high 29 points, kept answering Kansas baskets down the stretch. His 3-pointer got the Longhorns within 77-68 with 2:25 left, three free throws made it 78-71 with 1:31 to go, and his three-point play got the Longhorns (19-5, 8-3) within 86-80 with 23.5 seconds remaining.

            Texas quickly fouled Dick at the other end, and his free throw with 18 seconds left helped to put the game away.

            “It was as close to a must-win as you could have this early in the season to win the league,” Kansas coach Bill Self said. “You go down three games with seven left, you’d have to win out and get a lot of help from others. Now, we still have as hard a schedule as everybody, but we can kind of control our own destiny where if we play well, we have a shot.”

            Timmy Allen finished with 18 points for the Longhorns. Sir'Jabari Rice had 12 before fouling out.

            “It was their night tonight in terms of what they got done,” Texas interim coach Rodney Terry said.

            The Longhorns have made a habit of overcoming double-digit deficits: 18 down to beat TCU, 12 down to beat Texas Tech and 14 down to beat No. 12 Kansas State last Saturday in a game played just down the road.

            So it wasn't that surprising when Texas dug another 14-point hole Monday night.

            Just like the Longhorns did in Manhattan, though, they began to rally. Texas shook off 10 first-half turnovers to get within 42-35 by the break, then kept coming in the second half. Hunter hit a 3-pointer, Carr added a couple of buckets and it was 43-all when Self called a timeout to slow Texas' momentum.

            Unlike the Horned Frogs, Red Raiders and Wildcats, the Jayhawks rose to the challenge.

            McCullar's three-point play while they were clinging to a 49-48 lead gave them a boost, and Dick added a couple of free throws. But it was back-to-back buckets by Harris, who is known more as a distributor than as a scorer, that pushed the lead to 58-50 with about 12 minutes to go.

            Texas closed within 66-60 but, after the Jayhawks pulled down two offensive boards, Dick hit another 3-pointer. And when Yesufu bookended a couple of free throws by Harris, the lead had stretched to 75-62 with 3 minutes to go.

            The Jayhawks were able to fend off Carr and the Longhorns from there.

            “Give those guys credit. They came in and played at a very high level,” Terry said, “and we knew that would be the case.”

            BANGED-UP BIRDS

            The Jayhawks were missing several backups. Zack Clemence has a hurt knee, Bobby Pettiford Jr. is dealing with a hamstring injury and Zuby Ejiofor a foot injury. Kyle Cuffe Jr. (knee) and Cam Martin (shoulder) also were out.

            “I thought the bench was great. As good as they've been all year,” Self said. “We had nine guys we could put in the game.”

            BIG PICTURE

            Texas has struggled to get off to good starts this season, and it seemed the energy the Longhorns expended climbing back into Monday night's game was missing by the end. Carr tried to carry them but he needed more help.

            Kansas got the production it needed from the bench. Yesufu provided the scoring pop but big man Ernest Udeh Jr. and guard MJ Rice, both seldom-used freshmen, also provided important minutes for the Jayhawks.

            Texas heads home after its Sunflower State swing to play West Virginia on Saturday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802641,"Mahomes, Hurts aware of significance of this Super Bowl duel","PHOENIX (AP) — Philadelphia Eagles coach Nick Sirianni is thrilled young aspiring football players all over the world will get to watch two Black quarterbacks face each other for the first time in the Super Bowl.

            He's also pleased they get to watch two really, really good quarterbacks.

            “I'm really excited for both quarterbacks, what they can represent to a ton of kids,” Sirianni said at Monday's Super Bowl media night. ""Not only are they two African-American quarterbacks, but they're the two best quarterbacks in the NFL this year. First-team All-Pro, second-team All-Pro. 











            “They both play at the highest level.”

            There are many storylines for this Super Bowl, but the duel between Philadelphia's Jalen Hurts and Kansas City's Patrick Mahomes is right at the top of the list. 

            The significance of Sunday's matchup in Glendale, Arizona, isn't lost on Mahomes.

            “I think about it a lot,” Mahomes said. ""The quarterbacks that came before me — Shack Harris, Doug Williams — that laid the foundation for me to be in this position. It goes across all sports. If you think about Jackie Robinson and the people who broke the color barrier in baseball, I wouldn't be standing here today if it wasn't for them.

            “To be lucky enough to be in this position — and play against another great guy like Jalen — it will be a special moment. I'm glad we're here today, but how can we keep moving forward? How can we motivate kids who are younger, who want to follow their dreams to be a quarterback?""

            It's not just the quarterbacks who are relishing the groundbreaking matchup. Chiefs running back Jerick McKinnon said players are well aware of what they're witnessing.

            “There's history being made,” McKinnon said. ""That's a beautiful thing. Something I can look back and tell my kids that, ‘I was a part of that, I experienced that.’ So it's a blessing. This whole experience is a blessing.

            “To have that on top, just adds to it.”

            In addition to being good, both quarterbacks are also tough.

            Hurts missed two games late in the season with a shoulder injury that's still bothering him. The Eagles haven’t had to lean on him in two lopsided playoff wins. He has 275 yards passing and two TDs along with 73 yards rushing and two scores, pedestrian numbers by his standards.

            Mahomes hobbled around on a badly sprained ankle to help the Chiefs beat the Cincinnati Bengals 23-20 and advance to their third Super Bowl appearance in four years.

            “It's amazing — especially being Black History Month as well,” Eagles cornerback Darius Slay said. “I'm thankful for this moment, to be a part of this. This is crazy with two Black quarterbacks in the Super Bowl, one of the biggest games in the world.""

            Washington's Doug Williams was the first Black quarterback to start and win a Super Bowl following the 1987 season. That's back when Black quarterbacks were fairly rare across the NFL.

            This season — 35 years later — began with 11 Black QBs starting in Week 1 and now ends with a historic matchup. 

            Mahomes can become the first two-time winner if he leads the Chiefs to victory on Sunday. Hurts aims to become the fourth Black QB to win the Super Bowl, joining Williams, Mahomes and Russell Wilson.

            Steve McNair, Colin Kaepernick, Cam Newton and Wilson also started in a Super Bowl and lost. 

            Now it's Hurts vs. Mahomes.

            After McKinnon heard that Sirianni said the two quarterbacks were the top two in the league, he had a one-word response: “Facts.”

            “It’s going to be a showdown — all four quarters,” McKinnon said. “It’s going to come down to the last second. Jalen Hurts is phenomenal, I’ve been watching him since college. The things he does and brings to the table are phenomenal.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802642,Australia lifts cash rate to 3.35% with 9th rate hike,"CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — Australia's central bank on Tuesday lifted its benchmark interest rate for a ninth consecutive time to 3.35% as it battles inflation that rose to 7.8% in the latest quarter.

            The Reserve Bank of Australia’s decision to increase its cash rate by 0.25 of a basis point was widely anticipated after the annual inflation rate for the December quarter was the highest since 1990.

            “High inflation makes life difficult for people and damages the functioning of the economy,” Reserve Bank Governor Philip Lowe said in a statement.











            “And if high inflation were to become entrenched in people’s expectations, it would be very costly to reduce later,” he added.

            The board has been raising interest rates to try to bring inflation within the bank’s target band of 2% to and 3%, while hoping to avoid recession, he said.

            “But the path to achieving a soft landing remains a narrow one,” Lowe said.CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — Australia's central bank on Tuesday lifted its benchmark interest rate for a ninth consecutive time to 3.35% as it battles inflation that rose to 7.8% in the latest quarter.The Reserve Bank of Australia’s decision to increase its cash rate by 0.25 of a basis point was widely anticipated after the annual inflation rate for the December quarter was the highest since 1990.“High inflation makes life difficult for people and damages the functioning of the economy,” Reserve Bank Governor Philip Lowe said in a statement.“And if high inflation were to become entrenched in people’s expectations, it would be very costly to reduce later,” he added.The board has been raising interest rates to try to bring inflation within the bank’s target band of 2% to and 3%, while hoping to avoid recession, he said.“But the path to achieving a soft landing remains a narrow one,” Lowe said.",2023/2/7,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802643,Chrychrun scores twice as Coyotes beat Wild 3-2,"TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) — Jakob Chychrun had two goals, Jack McBain scored the tie-breaking goal on a breakaway with seven minutes remaining and the Arizona Coyotes beat the Minnesota Wild 3-2 on Monday night.

            McBain put a back-hander past Marc-Andre Fleury moments after the Coyotes killed off an abbreviated 55-second power play. Karel Vejmelka had 33 saves for his career-best third straight victory.

            “It wasn’t too pretty,” McBain said. “The puck was rolling and I just tried to do what I could to get it up and it ended up going in.”











             McBain skated in alone after breaking out of his own zone on a pass from Christian Fischer.

            “The worst was, he didn’t have an edge on his skate,” Coyotes coach Andre Tourigny said. “He said when he came back, ‘I could not skate.’ Pretty good for a guy who couldn’t skate.""

            Jonas Brodin gave the Wild a 2-1 lead 1:40 into the third period on a wrist shot from the left circle through a screen in front before Chychrun tied it at 2-2 with his second goal of the game at 9:35.

            “It was a huge two points, but they’re gone,” Minnesota coach Dean Evason said. “We have to regroup and put ourselves in a position where we adjust and correct.”

            Kirill Kaprizov also scored for the Wild and Fleury had 33 saves for the Wild, who had won two straight and five of eight. The Coyotes are 4-3-1 in their last eight games.

            “Definitely disappointing,” Fleury said. “We all know it is going to be a tight race from now on until the end of the season. Those are points that we need to have, especially when you have the lead in the third.”

            The Coyotes killed off a two-minute penalty with 2:34 left in the game, and the Wild put six skaters on the ice for the final 1:13.

            “Those are key moments in games,” Chychrun said. “We did a good job of fighting it off.”

            Kaprizov broke the scoreless tie with his 28th goal at 3:39 of the second period. He took a cross-ice pass from Mats Zuccarello and hit an open side for a 1-0 lead. Vejmelka, who had shutouts in his last two starts, extended his scoreless streak to 114:11 before the goal. 

            “I don’t think we should look for excuses,” Zucarello said. “I think we should go player by player and say what can we do better. We’re in the race here. We need to win.”

            Each team played its first game in nine days, and it showed early in a scoreless first period. The Coyotes had 14 of the 19 shots in the period and the best chances. Fleury made point-blank saves on Hayton nine minutes into the game and on Lawson Crouse with three minutes remaining in the period.

            “I felt we were as ready as we could be,” Tourigny said. “But what does that mean? You need to play the game. I have a lot of respect for Minny. They are physical. They are competitive. Even when we were trailing, we knew that was not the end of it. We stayed with it and found a way.”

            NOTES: Fleury, who still wears gold pads, glove and blocker, played in his 971st game, tying Terry Sawchuk for the fourth-most appearances by a goaltender in NHL history. Fleury has started four straight. … The Coyotes played their only home game in 18 days and will take a 16-game road winless streak into a three-game trip to Chicago, St. Louis and Nashville that begins Friday. … Coyotes F Jean-Sebastien Dea was recalled from Tucson of the American Hockey League and F Dylan Guenther was assigned to Seattle of the Western Hockey League. … Coyotes F Liam O’Brien (hand) has returned to practice but did not play, missing his 23rd straight game. … The Wild scratched D Alex Goligoski and F Mason Shaw.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802644,"Green, Hardy help Mavs surprise Jazz 124-111 without Doncic","SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Kyrie Irving hadn’t arrived yet and Luka Doncic was out, so it was time for the Dallas youngsters to shine.

            Josh Green and Jaden Hardy each scored career highs of 29 points and the short-handed Mavericks stunned the Utah Jazz 124-111 on Monday night after completing a trade for Irving.

            “Luka (and Irving) are going to have their amazing nights, but if we want to be a championship team it’s about the rest of us being able to step up,” Green said.











            The Mavericks acquired the eight-time All-Star along with Markieff Morris from the Brooklyn Nets in exchange for Spencer Dinwiddie, Dorian Finney-Smith, a 2029 first-round pick and two future second-round picks.

            Irving and Morris arrived in Dallas on Monday to undergo physicals and were not available for the game. But their new team rallied behind Green, who averages 8.1 points, and Hardy, who scores 5.6 per game.

            “We believed we could win this from before the game even started,” Hardy said. “The Jazz didn’t seem like they were taking it seriously. They came out late before the game to warm up, all nonchalant.”

            When Green was on the court, the Mavericks outscored the Jazz by an astonishing 39 points and won their first game in eight tries without Doncic, their leading scorer with 33.4 points a game.

            “The guys believed and Josh set the tone,” Dallas coach Jason Kidd said. “He understands how to play and he’s not afraid of the moment.”

            Doncic (heel bruise) missed his third game in 10 days. The Jazz beat the Mavs 108-100 on Jan. 28, when the Slovenian star was out with a sprained ankle. This time the Mavericks bested the Jazz in nearly hustle category, including a 49-37 advantage on the boards.

            “It was exemplified when (5-foot-11) McKinley Wright was boxing out (Utah’s 7-foot-1 Walker) Kessler. The physicality for us tonight was high, no matter how small we were out there,” Kidd said.

            After scoring 12 total points over six games, Hardy broke out for his career night and Dwight Powell added 12 points and a career-best 16 rebounds.

            “It was super fun,” Hardy said twice with a smile that didn’t leave his face for a long while.

            Jordan Clarkson paced Utah with 26 points on 7-for-19 shooting and Lauri Markkanen added 19 — the first time he has failed to reach 20 points in the last 21 games.

            “They played better than us. They played harder than us. Give credit to them, but I don’t think we were ready to play,” Markkanen said.

            The Jazz are now 7-5 on a stretch where they’re playing 11 of 13 games at home, when they hoped to gain ground on teams like Dallas, but are now two games behind the Mavs.

            The Jazz struggle when their 3s aren’t falling and they often fail to get back on defense. The upstart Mavs led the Jazz 27-4 on fast break points.

            “This is the first game all season where I just feel disappointed in our focus,” Utah coach Will Hardy said. “We just did not have the necessary focus and attention to the little things. They had 27 points in transition and 24 second-chance points and that’s how we lost the game.”

            As could be expected with different rotations and the end of the bench getting significant minutes, the Mavericks looked out of sync at times. But they started running at every opportunity and went on a 23-6 run bridging the second and third quarters to take a 75-66 lead. 

            The Jazz trimmed the lead to a single possession in the fourth quarter but could never catch the Mavs.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802645,Tyler Seguin's shootout goal gives Stars 3-2 win over Ducks,"DALLAS (AP) — Tyler Seguin scored Dallas’ second shootout goal, and the Stars beat the Anaheim Ducks 3-2 on Monday night.

            Nils Lundkvist and Roope Hintz scored in regulation for Dallas, and Jason Robertson also scored in the shootout. The Central Division leaders dropped three straight 3-2 games in overtime before the All-Star break.

            “When you look at the entirety of the game, we did some really good things,” Stars coach Pete DeBoer said.











            Dallas goaltender Jake Oettinger made 33 saves. He also denied Trevor Zegras and Adam Henrique in the shootout.

            Oettinger, who went into play tied for second in the league with a 2.26 goals-against average, is 5-0-0 against Anaheim.

            Henrique and Jakob Silfverberg scored in regulation for the Ducks, who had won a season-best three in a row. Mason McTavish scored in the shootout.

            Anaheim’s John Gibson stopped 39 shots through overtime.

            “He’s our star player,” Silfverberg said, “and he showed that tonight.”

            The Stars went 0 for 5 with the man advantage, including coming up empty on a 5-on-3 opportunity in the closing minutes of the second period.

            The Ducks are last in the Pacific Division with 38 points, on course for their fifth consecutive losing season.

            “I think when you’re in a rebuild like this, it’s easy to get down and check out once you get behind,” Ducks coach Dallas Eakins said, “but our guys seem to keep battling not only for the team but for each other.""

            Lundkvist scored on a backdoor pass through the low slot from Radek Faksa out of the left corner at 8:28 of the first period. Lundkvist was a healthy scratch in four of Dallas’ five previous games.

            Hintz tipped in a pass from the left boards by Denis Gurianov, making it 2-0 at 7:35 of the second period.

            Silfverberg and Henrique scored in an 86-second span midway through the third, tying it at 2. It was Silfverberg’s sixth goal of the season and No. 19 for Henrique.

            MILESTONE FOR BENN

            Dallas forward Jamie Benn skated in his 1,000th NHL game, all with the Stars. His accomplishment was recognized during the first TV break. His family watched from a suite.

            “It’s been a pretty fun last couple days with the ‘fam’ and a good night overall,” Benn said.

            Benn’s total is second in the history of the Minnesota-Dallas franchise behind Mike Modano’s 1,459 games.

            GONE BUT NOT FORGOTTEN

            Anaheim defenseman John Klingberg returned to Dallas after spending his first eight seasons with the Stars. He acknowledged a video tribute by his first NHL team.

            “This is where I started my career,” Klingberg said after the morning skate, “and it’s always going to be a special place.”

            Benn was penalized in overtime for high-sticking Klingberg.

            “I thought he dove,” Benn said.

Employees of sensitive government departments have to apply for permission before traveling overseas.The chief of the NSC secretariat was planning to take his family on a Malaysia Airlines flight scheduled for Jan. 22 at 12:15 a.m., as he had obtained permission from his employer to leave the country for the Jan. 22-26 period.However, as he tried to go through immigration late on Jan. 21, the electronic system rejected his NSC document, and an argument erupted between the NSC official and immigration officers. He shouted and slammed his fist on a desk, the Liberty Times reported.According to the National Immigration Agency (NIA), once the situation was cleared up, the NSC official and his family were allowed to pass through and board their flight, which left at 12:08 a.m. However, the NIA reminded government officials who need permission from their department to leave the country that if their flight was scheduled early in the morning, they should ask for leave for the previous day as well in order to make immigration proceedings easier.The NSC apologized to the relevant authorities for the incident, while it would consider how to improve its procedures to prevent future misunderstandings, per UDN.",2023/2/7,2280,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802668,"Thompson scores 42 points with 12 3s, Warriors beat Thunder","SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — With star teammate Stephen Curry sidelined, Klay Thompson kept shooting and took care of the offensive load the Golden State Warriors were missing without their reigning NBA Finals MVP.

            Thompson scored 42 points with a season-high 12 3-pointers, Jordan Poole added 21 points and career-best 12 assists starting in Curry's place, and the Warriors beat the Oklahoma City Thunder 141-114 on Monday night.

            “It was a beautiful game to watch him play,” Draymond Green said of Thompson.











            “... We needed it. It’s been a while since we had a blowout win. It's good to get this one, especially first game with Steph out. It was good to start off on this foot and try to create some momentum.""

            Thompson sat down for the night to a roaring ovation with 4:41 left to finish 15 for 22 from the floor and 12 of 16 on 3s. Thompson now has eight games with 10 or more 3-pointers, second in NBA history behind Splash Brother Curry's 22.

            “This is a confidence booster for sure to play without him, but to see the performance of the team, amazing individual performances we got,” coach Steve Kerr said. ""It was a feel-good game for a lot of people and that just really fuels everybody. Hopefully we can keep that going.”

            Andrew Wiggins scored 18 points in Golden State's first game since losing Curry to a left leg injury late in the third quarter of Saturday's win against Dallas — and the Warriors went 26 of 50 from deep without the league's career 3-point leader.

            They also didn't let down late as has been a concern and frustration recently for Kerr.

            “That was fun, that was probably the most fun I’ve had watching our team all year,” Kerr said.

            Thompson had 27 points at halftime, going 10 of 14 from the floor and 7 for 9 on 3-pointers as the Warriors led 60-53. Poole dished out five assists in the opening quarter, then helped Golden State start the third on a 19-7 burst to pull away for their eighth straight win in the series.

            “I thought Jordan was magnificent, one of the best games I’ve ever seen him play. He just was so under control,” Kerr said.

            Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 20 points, Aaron Wiggins added 19 and Tre Mann had 18 off the bench for the Thunder. Josh Giddey contributed 15 points, eight assists and seven rebounds as Oklahoma City struggled in the opener of a road back-to-back coming off a franchise-record 153 points in Saturday's home win over Houston.

            TIP-INS

            Thunder: G Lu Dort sat out again after he missed Saturday’s game with a strained right hamstring. ... The Thunder were outrebounded 45-36. ... Oklahoma City dropped to 9-17 on the road, 3-10 vs. the West. The Thunder have lost four in a row on the Warriors' home floor.

            Warriors: Poole had his first double-double of the season and third of his career. ... Golden State is 7-5 without Curry, who was previously sidelined Dec. 16-Jan. 7 with a shoulder injury. “We’ve already been through a stretch without Steph and handled it pretty well, so we’re confident we can do that again,” Kerr said.

            ROLLINS SURGERY

            Warriors rookie guard Ryan Rollins is set to have surgery Wednesday for a broken pinkie toe in his right foot and he will likely miss the rest of the season. 

            Golden State acquired the draft rights to Rollins from the Hawks, who selected him 44th overall in the second round.

            He played in 12 games for the Warriors and 19 for the G League Santa Cruz team, where he averaged 19.5 points, 3.7 rebounds and 3.7 assists in 25.6 minutes.

            SENSORY ROOM

            The Warriors and Marvel actor Simu Liu unveiled the “Simu Liu Sensory Room"" for guests who might need a quiet space when feeling overwhelmed or overstimulated.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802669,State of the Union? Congress doesn't fully reflect diversity,"WASHINGTON (AP) — When lawmakers gather for President Joe Biden's State of the Union address, the Republican side of the aisle will look slightly different than it did a few years ago.

            Rather than row after row of white men in suits, the House Republican majority increasingly has added Black, Latino and female elected officials to their ranks, an effort toward bolstering GOP diversity that's helping to make the new Congress the most racially and ethnically diverse ever. 

            It's a slow yet unsteady progress toward creating a Congress more reflective of America. But it also spotlights a still stark gap on the House Republican side, where the new majority remains made up mostly of white, male lawmakers, which does not fully capture the changing demographics of the country. 











            “Diversity matters,"" said Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for Women and Politics at Rutgers University.

            “Every person who serves in office brings with them a set of life experiences that shape their policy priorities, that shape how they see the world,” Walsh said. “It’s not that the experiences of white men don’t matter, but they don’t matter — they shouldn’t matter — more than everybody else.”

            House Speaker Kevin McCarthy is largely responsible for making strides at trying to diversify the Republican House. The California leader personally recruited and helped to elect more female candidates and people of color who delivered majority control.

            McCarthy and his team worked to diversify their ranks during the 2022 midterm elections with dozens of Black, Hispanic and Asian American nominees on ballots nationwide, some of whom won office. 

            Still, compared with the diversity on the Democratic side of the aisle, the Republican tally remains slim.

            There are four Black Republicans in the House — twice as many as in the last session. That's a record for Republicans in the 20th and 21st centuries. 

            But it's still fewer Black Republicans in the House than during Reconstruction, the era that followed the Civil War. As many as seven Black Republicans served in the House during the 1875-77 session, according to the U.S. House Historical Office, and the House membership overall was much smaller.

            Women are making steady gains in the Republican Party in the House, with 33 GOP women in the House, according to the Center for Women in American Politics. That's up from 13 House Republican women in 2019.

            But there are no Black Republican women in the House, compared with 27 Black women on the Democratic side, including some who have been powerful leaders and chairwomen wielding gavels. 

            Republicans count five Latina women and two Asian Americans, a fraction of those the Democrats have elected, according to the Center for Women and Politics. 

            While the House freshman class includes seven new Republican women, the gains were essentially offset by six Republican women leaving, the center said in its analysis of the new Congress.

            House Republicans have held steady with about a dozen Latino and Hispanic lawmakers, but overall the proportion of Latinos in Congress is less than in the U.S. population. 

            “This continues a long-running trend toward more racial and ethnic diversity on Capitol Hill: This is the seventh Congress to break the record set by the one before it,” said Pew Research Center, including senators in its tally.

            But Pew reports a vast divide by party for the racial and ethnic minority members in the new Congress: 80% are Democrats while 20% are Republicans. The report said that's similar to the last session of Congress. At that time, 83% of non-white lawmakers were Democrats and 17% were Republicans.

            Pew said 13 members of Congress identify as lesbian, gay or bisexual, the highest number openly identified in history. Among the 11 openly gay or lesbian members of the House, just one is a Republican, Rep. George Santos of New York. 

            The Senate shows strides, too, with 25 women this session, including nine Republican female senators, matching the record set in 2020, according the Center for Women and Politics.

            Among the 100 senators, there is one Black Republican, Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, and two Black Democrats, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Sen. Raphael Warnock of Georgia.

            There are no Black women elected to the Senate.

            There are six Latino or Hispanic senators, including two Republicans; and there are two Asian American senators, both Democrats. 

            One new Republican, Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma, “a member of the Cherokee nation, is the first American Indian to serve in the Senate in almost two decades,” the Pew Report said.

            ""I wouldn't call it strides,"" said Rashad Robinson, president of the Color of Change, a racial justice organization.

            “We have complicated problems in this country that require solutions that come from a range of perspectives and that require us to think seriously about how we move forward,” he said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802670,Arkansas Gov. Sanders slams Biden for 'woke fantasies',"LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) — Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders painted a dystopian portrait of the country in her rebuttal to President Joe Biden’s State of the Union address Tuesday night, leaning heavily into Republican culture war issues and accusing Biden of pursuing “woke fantasies.”

            Speaking from the governor’s mansion in Little Rock, Sanders sounded a lot like her former boss, Donald Trump, as she warned of a nation whose ideals are under attack and whose citizens are fighting for their freedoms.

            “While you reap the consequences of their failures, the Biden administration seems more interested in woke fantasies than the hard reality Americans face every day,” said Sanders, the former White House press secretary. “Most Americans simply want to live their lives in freedom and peace, but we are under attack in a left-wing culture war we didn’t start and never wanted to fight.”











            Sanders, 40, delivered the speech less than a month after being sworn in as the first female governor of Arkansas. The daughter of former Gov. Mike Huckabee, she is also the first Arkansan to deliver the response to a president’s State of the Union since Bill Clinton as governor in 1985.

            Sanders’ speech was a reintroduction for the former press secretary, who as Trump’s chief spokesperson scaled back daily televised briefings after repeatedly sparring with reporters who aggressively questioned her. 

            She didn't mention Trump by name during Tuesday's speech, which embraced conservatives' fights against the way race is taught in public school. She called Biden's administration “completely hijacked by the radical left.""

            “The dividing line in America is no longer right or left,"" she said. “The choice is between normal or crazy.""

            Sanders' speech was a stark contrast to Biden's address, which sought to reassure the country and urged Congress to work with him on rebuilding the economy.

            With her speech, GOP leaders gave a platform to a figure linked closely to Trump, who remains influential within the party even as Republicans question how much of a hindrance his quest to return to the White House has become. The star turn for Sanders also puts the spotlight on the nation’s youngest governor at a time when recent polling suggests that even many Democrats view the 80-year-old Biden’s age as a liability. 

            Sanders highlighted that contrast, citing Biden's age as the oldest U.S. president.

            “It’s time for a new generation of Republican leadership,"" she said. 

            Her speech comes as a Republican field for 2024 is beginning to form to challenge Trump, 76, as he seeks the White House for a third time. The field includes former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who served as U.N. ambassador under Trump and is expected to launch her candidacy next week. 

            Sanders' predecessor, former Gov. Asa Hutchinson, is also considering seeking the Republican presidential nomination. Hutchinson has been an outspoken critic of Trump and has said Trump being the GOP’s nominee would be the “worst scenario” for the party.

            Sanders, who served roughly two years as White House press secretary, focused heavily on her criticism of Biden during her successful bid for governor last year. She frequently railed against the Democratic president’s COVID-19 pandemic response, immigration policies and other stances.

            But since the election, Sanders has mostly avoided weighing in on Trump, who endorsed her bid for governor and was featured in her campaign materials. Sanders hasn’t said whether she plans to endorse Trump, who’s making a third bid for president. 

            In her speech Tuesday, Sanders praised her time in the Trump administration and the work they accomplished. She also talked about her diagnosis last year with thyroid cancer, and said she is cancer-free after undergoing surgery.

            Sanders also embraced the criticism of technology companies that has become a rallying cry for Republicans after Trump was suspended from social media sites following the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot. Trump has since been reinstated on Twitter, and Meta last month said the former president’s Facebook and Instagram accounts will be restored.

            In her speech, Sanders complained that “big government colludes with Big Tech to strip away the most American thing there is — your freedom of speech.”

            “That’s not normal. It’s crazy, and it’s wrong,” she said.

            Sanders portrayed Biden as weak on national security, saying his “refusal to stand up to China, our most formidable adversary, is dangerous and unacceptable."" The comment came days after the American military shot down a suspected Chinese spy balloon that drifted through U.S. airspace. 

            Officials have said other Chinese balloons transited the U.S. airspace at least briefly at multiple points during the Trump administration but those incursions were not detected until after Biden took office.

            The culture wars are familiar territory for Sanders, who signed executive orders within hours of taking office that were cheered by conservatives. They included a prohibition on teaching critical race theory in public schools and a ban on most state agencies using the gender-neutral term Latinx. 

            Sanders has also said she’d support Arkansas enacting a measure similar to Florida’s law banning instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through third grade. Critics have dubbed Florida’s measure the “Don’t Say Gay” law.

            The president, who's expected to announce in the next few months that he'll seek reelection, faces a tough political environment and a divided Congress. Polling released this week by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research showed just 37% of Democrats say they want him to seek a second term.

            Sanders delivered the speech the day before she's set to unveil an education proposal she's called her priority in this year's legislative session. Sanders has said the proposal will include teacher pay raises and some form of school choice that would allow public money to pay for private schooling.

            “We will educate, not indoctrinate our kids, and put students on a path to success,"" she said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802673,Biden in State of Union exhorts Congress: 'Finish the job',"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden exhorted Congress Tuesday night to work with him to “finish the job” of rebuilding the economy and uniting the nation as he delivered a State of the Union address aimed at reassuring a country beset by pessimism and fraught political divisions.

            In his 73-minute speech, Biden sought to portray a nation dramatically improved from the one he took charge of two years ago: from a reeling economy to one prosperous with new jobs; from a crippled, pandemic-weary nation to one that has now reopened, and a democracy that has survived its biggest test since the Civil War.

            “Folks, the story of America is a story of progress and resilience. Of always moving forward. Of never, ever, giving up,” Biden said. “It’s a story unique among all nations. We’re the only country that has emerged from every crisis we’ve ever entered stronger than when we got into it.”











            “We’re not finished yet by any stretch of the imagination,"" he declared.

            The backdrop for the annual address was markedly different from the previous two years, with a Republican speaker now sitting expressionless behind Biden and newly empowered GOP lawmakers in the chamber sometimes shouting criticism of him and his administration.

            As Biden, 80, prepares for a likely reelection bid, he sought to prove to a skeptical nation that his stewardship has delivered results both at home and abroad. He highlighted record job creation during his tenure as the country has emerged from the COVID-19 pandemic, and pointed to areas of bipartisan progress in his first two years in office, including on states’ vital infrastructure projects and high-tech manufacturing. And he said, “There is no reason we can’t work together and find consensus on important thing in this Congress as well.""

            “The people sent us a clear message. Fighting for the sake of fighting, power for the sake of power, conflict for the sake of conflict, gets us nowhere,” Biden said. “That’s always been my vision for the country: to restore the soul of the nation, to rebuild the backbone of America — the middle class — and unite the country.”

            “We’ve been sent here to finish the job!”

            But the challenges for Biden are many: economic uncertainty, a wearying war in Ukraine, growing tensions with China and more. Signs of past trauma at the Capitol, most notably the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection, were unavoidable: A large fence encircled the complex, and lawmakers and those in attendance faced tighter-than-usual security.

            From the start, the heightened partisan divisions were clear. Democrats — including Vice President Kamala Harris — jumped to applause as Biden began his speech. New Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, though he had greeted the president warmly when he entered the chamber, stayed in his seat.

            The speech came as Biden has shifted his sights after spending his first two years pushing through major bills such as the bipartisan infrastructure package, legislation to promote high-tech manufacturing and climate measures. With Republicans now in control of the House, and even meeting the government’s fiscal obligations far from certain, Biden is turning his focus to implementing those massive laws and making sure voters credit him for the improvements. 

            Instead of flashy proposals, the president offered an encouraging assessment of the nation’s condition, declaring that two years after the Capitol attack, America’s democracy was “unbowed and unbroken.”

            The president took to the House rostrum at a time when just a quarter of U.S. adults say things are headed in the right direction, according to a new poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. About three-quarters say things are on the wrong track. And a majority of Democrats don’t want Biden to seek another term. 

            He sought to confront those sentiments head-on.

            “You wonder whether the path even exists anymore for your children to get ahead without having to move away,” Biden said. “I get that. That’s why we’re building an economy where no one is left behind. Jobs are coming back, pride is coming back because of the choices we made in the last several years.”

            Biden on Wednesday was to travel to Wisconsin, as he and members of his Cabinet embark on a two-day, 20-state blitz to highlight economic progress in his first two years in office.

            Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who gained a national profile as former President Donald Trump’s press secretary, delivered the Republican response to Biden’s speech.

            She focused much of her remarks on social issues, including race in business and education and alleged big-tech censorship of conservatives.

            “While you reap the consequences of their failures, the Biden administration seems more interested in woke fantasies than the hard reality Americans face every day,” she said. “Most Americans simply want to live their lives in freedom and peace, but we are under attack in a left-wing culture war we didn’t start and never wanted to fight.”

            “The choice is between normal and crazy,” she added.

            With COVID-19 restrictions now lifted, the White House and legislators from both parties invited guests designed to drive home political messages with their presence in the House chamber. The mother and stepfather of Tyre Nichols, who was severely beaten by police officers in Memphis and later died, were among those seated with first lady Jill Biden. Other Biden guests included the rock star/humanitarian Bono and 26-year-old Brandon Tsay, who disarmed a gunman in last month’s Monterey Park, California, shooting.

            “There's no words to describe the heartache and grief of losing a child,” Biden said after introducing RowVaughn and Rodney Wells to a standing ovation. He called on Congress to “rise to this moment"" to make meaningful change in policing.

            Biden drew bipartisan applause when he praised most law enforcement officers as “good, decent, honorable people” but added that “when police officers or police departments violate the public’s trust, they must be held accountable.""

            Members of the Congressional Black Caucus invited family members of those involved in police incidents, as they sought to press for action on police reform in the wake of Nichols’ death. 

            Biden, not known for his lofty oratory, appeared relaxed and confident as he delivered his address. He casually adlibbed jokes and rejoinders, seeming to feed off the responses from Democratic lawmakers who frequently stood with thunderous ovations and playfully engaging with Republican critics.

            Addressing Republicans who voted against the big bipartisan infrastructure law, Biden said he'd still ensure their pet projects received federal support. “I promised to be the president for all Americans,"" he said. ""We’ll fund these projects. And I’ll see you at the ground-breaking.”

            Occasional Republican heckling — some drawing hushes from McCarthy — reflected the newly empowered GOP that is itching to undo many of Biden's achievements and vowing to pursue a multitude of investigations — including looking into the recent discoveries of classified documents from his time as vice president at his home and former office.

            Though he pledged bipartisanship where possible, Biden also underscored the sharp tensions that exist: He discussed GOP efforts to repeal the Democrats' 2022 climate change and healthcare law and their reluctance to increase the federal debt limit, the nation’s legal borrowing authority that must be raised later this year or risk default.

            “Instead of making the wealthy pay their fair share, some Republicans — some Republicans want Medicare and Social Security to sunset. I am not saying it’s a majority,” Biden said. As GOP lawmakers in the audience pushed back, Biden responded: “We’re not going to be moved into being threatened to default on the debt if we don’t respond.”

            Still, some Republicans refused to back down, with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., and others jumping to their feet, some yelling “Liar!”

            The president answered back, “Stand up and show them: We will not cut Social Security! We will not cut Medicare!”

            As Republicans continued to protest his accusations, he said, “We’ve got unanimity.""

            While hopes for large-scale bipartisanship are slim, Biden reissued his 2022 appeal for Congress to get behind his “unity agenda” of actions to address the opioid epidemic, mental health, veterans’ health and cancer.

            In fiery refrains, Biden said the phrase “finish the job” 13 times, challenging lawmakers to complete the work of his administration on capping insulin costs for all Americans, confronting climate change, raising taxes on the wealthy and corporations and banning assault-style weapons. But on all of those fronts, the divided government is even less likely to yield than the Congress under sole Democratic control.

            The speech came days after Biden ordered the military to shoot down a suspected Chinese spy balloon that flew brazenly across the country, captivating the nation and serving as a reminder of tense relations between the two global powers.

            “Make no mistake: As we made clear last week, if China’s threatens our sovereignty, we will act to protect our country,” Biden said. “And we did.”

            Last year’s address occurred just days after Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine and as many in the West doubted Kyiv’s ability to withstand the onslaught. Over the past year, the U.S. and other allies have sent tens of billions of dollars in military and economic assistance to bolster Ukraine’s defenses. Now, Biden must make the case — both at home and abroad — for sustaining that coalition as the war drags on.

            “Together, we did what America always does at our best,” Biden said. “We led. We united NATO. We built a global coalition. We stood against Putin’s aggression. We stood with the Ukrainian people.”

            Follow AP’s coverage of the State of the Union address at: https://apnews.com/hub/state-of-the-union-addressWASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden exhorted Congress Tuesday night to work with him to “finish the job” of rebuilding the economy and uniting the nation as he delivered a State of the Union address aimed at reassuring a country beset by pessimism and fraught political divisions.In his 73-minute speech, Biden sought to portray a nation dramatically improved from the one he took charge of two years ago: from a reeling economy to one prosperous with new jobs; from a crippled, pandemic-weary nation to one that has now reopened, and a democracy that has survived its biggest test since the Civil War.“Folks, the story of America is a story of progress and resilience. Of always moving forward. Of never, ever, giving up,” Biden said. “It’s a story unique among all nations. We’re the only country that has emerged from every crisis we’ve ever entered stronger than when we got into it.”“We’re not finished yet by any stretch of the imagination,"" he declared.The backdrop for the annual address was markedly different from the previous two years, with a Republican speaker now sitting expressionless behind Biden and newly empowered GOP lawmakers in the chamber sometimes shouting criticism of him and his administration.As Biden, 80, prepares for a likely reelection bid, he sought to prove to a skeptical nation that his stewardship has delivered results both at home and abroad. He highlighted record job creation during his tenure as the country has emerged from the COVID-19 pandemic, and pointed to areas of bipartisan progress in his first two years in office, including on states’ vital infrastructure projects and high-tech manufacturing. And he said, “There is no reason we can’t work together and find consensus on important thing in this Congress as well.""“The people sent us a clear message. Fighting for the sake of fighting, power for the sake of power, conflict for the sake of conflict, gets us nowhere,” Biden said. “That’s always been my vision for the country: to restore the soul of the nation, to rebuild the backbone of America — the middle class — and unite the country.”“We’ve been sent here to finish the job!”But the challenges for Biden are many: economic uncertainty, a wearying war in Ukraine, growing tensions with China and more. Signs of past trauma at the Capitol, most notably the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection, were unavoidable: A large fence encircled the complex, and lawmakers and those in attendance faced tighter-than-usual security.From the start, the heightened partisan divisions were clear. Democrats — including Vice President Kamala Harris — jumped to applause as Biden began his speech. New Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, though he had greeted the president warmly when he entered the chamber, stayed in his seat.The speech came as Biden has shifted his sights after spending his first two years pushing through major bills such as the bipartisan infrastructure package, legislation to promote high-tech manufacturing and climate measures. With Republicans now in control of the House, and even meeting the government’s fiscal obligations far from certain, Biden is turning his focus to implementing those massive laws and making sure voters credit him for the improvements.Instead of flashy proposals, the president offered an encouraging assessment of the nation’s condition, declaring that two years after the Capitol attack, America’s democracy was “unbowed and unbroken.”The president took to the House rostrum at a time when just a quarter of U.S. adults say things are headed in the right direction, according to a new poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. About three-quarters say things are on the wrong track. And a majority of Democrats don’t want Biden to seek another term.He sought to confront those sentiments head-on.“You wonder whether the path even exists anymore for your children to get ahead without having to move away,” Biden said. “I get that. That’s why we’re building an economy where no one is left behind. Jobs are coming back, pride is coming back because of the choices we made in the last several years.”Biden on Wednesday was to travel to Wisconsin, as he and members of his Cabinet embark on a two-day, 20-state blitz to highlight economic progress in his first two years in office.Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who gained a national profile as former President Donald Trump’s press secretary, delivered the Republican response to Biden’s speech.She focused much of her remarks on social issues, including race in business and education and alleged big-tech censorship of conservatives.“While you reap the consequences of their failures, the Biden administration seems more interested in woke fantasies than the hard reality Americans face every day,” she said. “Most Americans simply want to live their lives in freedom and peace, but we are under attack in a left-wing culture war we didn’t start and never wanted to fight.”“The choice is between normal and crazy,” she added.With COVID-19 restrictions now lifted, the White House and legislators from both parties invited guests designed to drive home political messages with their presence in the House chamber. The mother and stepfather of Tyre Nichols, who was severely beaten by police officers in Memphis and later died, were among those seated with first lady Jill Biden.

            The mother of All-Pros Travis and Jason Kelce surprised her sons during an interview with NFL Network's Michael Irvin with two batches of cookies — one for each.

            ""It's just been amazing that they've both been able to get to this point in their careers and both enjoy the Super Bowl together,"" Donna Kelce said. “It's just so amazing.”











            The Kelces are the first brothers to face each other in the Super Bowl, Travis as a tight end for the Kansas City Chiefs, Jason as a center for the Philadelphia Eagles.

            Donna and her husband, Ed, have mostly kept private over the years, but she's become a minor celebrity as she crisscrosses the country to watch her boys — often in a jersey with Travis’ front stitched to Jason’s back. 

            More than 150,000 fans signed a petition for the NFL to have her do the Super Bowl coin toss, but she said in a social media post that the NFL already had someone in place.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802686,Asian shares mixed after Wall St gains on Fed chair comments,"BANGKOK (AP) — Shares were mixed in Asia on Wednesday after stocks rallied on Wall Street following comments by the chair of the Federal Reserve signaling that last week’s stunningly strong jobs report won’t by itself sway its stance on interest rates hikes. 

            Hong Kong, Sydney and Seoul rose while Tokyo and Shanghai declined. U.S. futures edged lower while oil prices were little changed. 

            The benchmark S&P 500 climbed 1.3% following a shaky day where stocks pinballed between losses and gains as Fed Chair Jerome Powell gave his first public comments since raising rates last week. Other indexes also gained. 











            Tokyo shares were weighed down by losses in electronics and tech-related companies like Nintendo and Sharp Corp. that have reported steep losses in the latest round of earnings. 

            
                SoftBank fell 6.5% after reporting its net profit sank $5.9 billion in the last quarter. Nintendo sank 7.4% following its latest earnings update, which showed a slight decline in profit in April-December from the year before. 

            The Nikkei 225 index lost 0.4% to 27,568.72. The Shanghai Composite index edged 0.1% lower to 3,246.53. Hong Kong's Hang Seng added 0.3% to 21,361.20. In Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 also gained 0.3% to 7,527.20. 

            South Korea's Kospi advanced 1.3% to 15,062.99. Shares slipped in Bangkok and rose in Taiwan and Singapore. 

            Tuesday on Wall Street, the S&P 500 rose to 4,164.00 and the Dow gained 0.8% to 34,156.69. The Nasdaq jumped 1.9% to 12,113.79.

            High inflation and how high the Fed will take interest rates to combat it have been at the center of Wall Street's gyrations in the last year. Powell said on Tuesday that progress is being made on inflation, though a long battle remains. 

            That echoed similar comments he made last week, after the Fed approved its smallest increase to interest rates since March, before a jolting jobs report on Friday showed U.S. employers added a third of a million more jobs than expected last month. 

            That raised concerns about upward pressure on inflation and worries the Fed may keep rates higher for longer, as it’s been warning. Higher rates can drive down inflation but also hurt the economy and investment prices.

            Powell said Tuesday at the Economic Club of Washington, D.C., that the market’s big moves since the jobs report have gotten it closer to in sync with the Fed’s thinking. Not only did stocks fall, Wall Street raised its forecast for how high the Fed will take rates by the summer. 

            “We have a significant road ahead to get inflation down to 2%,” which is the Fed’s target, Powell said Tuesday. “There’s been an expectation that it will go away quickly and painlessly. I don’t think that’s at all guaranteed.”

            After pulling its key overnight rate all the way to a range of 4.50% to 4.75%, up from virtually zero a year ago, the Fed has said it envisions a couple more increases before holding steady through the end of the year. 

            Despite all the market's recent moves, stock prices are still up a healthy amount since the start of the year. The S&P 500 is up 8.5%. Much of that was due to easing worries the economy may fall into a severe recession, a scenario described in markets as a “hard landing.” 

            A relatively lackluster earnings reporting season is rolling on. 

            Carrier Global dropped 3.8% despite matching analysts’ expectations for profits in the latest quarter. DuPont climbed 7.5% after reporting stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Activision Blizzard gained 5.6% after the video-game company reported stronger revenue and profit for its latest quarter than expected.

            A 4.2% move higher for Microsoft also helped lift the market. It said it's using ChatGPT-like technology in its Bing search engine.

            U.S. benchmark crude oil rose 7 cents to $77.21 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It gained $3.03 to $77.14 per barrel on Tuesday. 

            Brent crude, the pricing benchmark for international trading, slipped 1 cent to $83.68 per barrel. 

            The U.S. dollar rose to 131.17 Japanese yen from 131.11 yen. The euro rose to $1.0733 from $1.0726.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802687,"Boeing plans to cut about 2,000 finance and HR jobs in 2023","SEATTLE (AP) — Boeing plans to make staffing cuts in the aerospace company's finance and human resources departments in 2023, with a loss of around 2,000 jobs, the company said.

            “We expect about 2,000 reductions primarily in Finance and HR through a combination of attrition and layoffs,” Boeing said in a statement Monday. “While no one has been notified of job loss, we will continue to share information transparently to allow people to plan.”

            The company, which recently relocated its headquarters to Arlington, Virginia, said it expects to “significantly grow” the overall workforce during the year. “We grew Boeing’s workforce by 15,000 last year and plan to hire another 10,000 employees this year with a focus on engineering and manufacturing,” the statement said.











            Boeing's total workforce was 156,000 employees as of Dec. 31, 2022, the company said.

            
                The Seattle Times reported Boeing, which has been one of the largest private employers in Washington state, plans to outsource about a third of the eliminated positions to Tata Consulting Services in Bengaluru, India.

            Mike Friedman, a senior director of communications, told the Times the other positions will be eliminated as the company makes reductions in finance and human resources support services.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802688,Bucks beat Trail Blazers 127-108 for 8th straight win,"PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — Brook Lopez scored 27 points and the Milwaukee Bucks stretched their winning streak to eight games with a 127-108 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers on Monday night. 

            Giannis Antetokounmpo had 24 points and 13 rebounds as the Bucks led the whole way, pushing their advantage to 26 in the second half. 

            Lopez, who pulled down nine rebounds, topped all scorers with 17 points at halftime and Milwaukee led 58-48. He hit a 3-pointer with 10:41 left in the third quarter that gave him 15,000 career points.











            “I have a long way to still go, a long time to still play. I’m just enjoying it and I want to keep getting better, keep being an effective player out there, being the best player I could be,"" said Lopez, who is in his 14th season. “I’m lucky that there are people that are out there trying to help me, trying to make me better and put me in that position.”

            Damian Lillard led the Blazers with 28 points. Antetokounmpo and Lillard were selected the NBA's players of the week earlier in the day. 

            Lillard averaged 38.3 points and 6.8 assists last week for his second straight POTW honor, while Antetokounmpo averaged 41 points and 17.3 rebounds. 

            Antetokounmpo started despite right knee soreness. The two-time league MVP had a triple-double with 35 points, 15 rebounds and 11 assists on Saturday to lead the Bucks to a 123-115 victory over Miami. 

            Portland was coming off a 129-121 loss at Chicago on Saturday that snapped a three-game winning streak 

            With center Jusuf Nurkic unavailable because of a left calf strain, the Blazers struggled against the bigger Bucks. 

            Milwaukee led by as many as 15 in the first half, but Lillard drained a 3 from about two feet inside the half-court line that brought gasps and then cheers from the home crowd. 

            The Bucks finished the third period on a 22-8 run to lead 95-71. 

            Portland made just nine of 36 attempts from 3-point range. 

            “They made some adjustments to their defense this year, to be honest with you,"" Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups said. ""They used to give up like the most 3s in the league because of that drop coverage. Not this year. I've got to give them a ton of credit. (Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer) has done a really good job. They’re still a really dominant defense but they’re not giving up as many 3s, so you’ve got to work even harder to get those looks.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802690,Fears grow for untold numbers buried by Turkey earthquake,"NURDAGI, Turkey (AP) — Rescuers raced against time early Wednesday to pull survivors from the rubble before they succumbed to cold weather two days after an earthquake tore through southern Turkey and war-ravaged northern Syria. The death toll climbed above 7,700 and was expected to rise further.

            The last two days have brought dramatic rescues, including small children emerging from mounds of debris more than 30 hours after Monday's pre-dawn quake. But there was also widespread despair and growing anger at the slow pace of rescue efforts in some areas.

            “It’s like we woke up to hell,” said Osman Can Taninmis, whose family members were still beneath the rubble in Hatay, Turkey's hardest-hit province. “Help isn’t coming, can’t come. We can’t reach anyone at all. Everywhere is destroyed.”











            In Syria, residents found a crying newborn still connected by the umbilical cord to her mother, who was dead. The baby was the only member of her family to survive a building collapse in the small town of Jinderis, relatives told The Associated Press.

            Search teams from nearly 30 countries and aid pledges poured in. But with the damage spread across several cities and towns — some isolated by Syria's ongoing conflict — voices crying for help from within mounds of rubble fell silent.

            
                Monday's magnitude 7.8 quake and powerful aftershocks cut a swath of destruction that stretched hundreds of kilometers (miles) across southeastern Turkey and neighboring Syria. The shaking toppled thousands of buildings and heaped more misery on a region wracked by Syria’s 12-year civil war and refugee crisis.

            Turkey is home to millions of refugees from the war. The affected area in Syria is divided between government-controlled territory and the country’s last opposition-held enclave, where millions rely on humanitarian aid to survive.

            Unstable piles of metal and concrete made the search efforts perilous, while freezing temperatures made them ever more urgent, as worries grew about how long trapped survivors could last in the cold. Snow swirled around rescuers in parts of Turkey.

            The scale of the suffering — and the accompanying rescue effort — were staggering.

            Many survivors in Turkey have had to sleep in cars, outside or in government shelters.

            “We don’t have a tent, we don’t have a heating stove, we don’t have anything. Our children are in bad shape. We are all getting wet under the rain and our kids are out in the cold,” Aysan Kurt, 27, told the AP. “We did not die from hunger or the earthquake, but we will die freezing from the cold.”

            Adelheid Marschang, a senior emergencies officer with the World Health Organization, said up to 23 million people could be affected in the entire quake-hit area, calling it a “crisis on top of multiple crises.”

            Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said 13 million of the country's 85 million people were affected, and he declared a state of emergency in 10 provinces. More than 8,000 people have been pulled from the debris in Turkey, and some 380,000 have taken refuge in government shelters or hotels, authorities said.

            But authorities faced criticism from residents of hard-hit Hatay, sandwiched between Syria and the Mediterranean Sea, who say rescue efforts have lagged. Erdogan's handling of the crisis could weigh heavily on elections planned for May, and his office has already dismissed the criticism as disinformation.

            Nurgul Atay told The Associated Press she could hear her mother’s voice beneath the rubble of a collapsed building in the Turkish city of Antakya, the capital of Hatay province. But rescuers did not have the heavy equipment needed to rescue her.

            “If only we could lift the concrete slab, we’d be able to reach her,” she said. “My mother is 70 years old, she won’t be able to withstand this for long.”

            Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said 1,647 people were killed in Hatay alone, the highest toll of any Turkish province. At least 1,846 people had been rescued there as of Tuesday evening, he said. Hatay’s airport was closed after the quake destroyed the runway, complicating rescue efforts.

            In Syria, meanwhile, aid efforts have been hampered by the ongoing war and the isolation of the rebel-held region along the border, which is surrounded by Russia-backed government forces. Syria itself is an international pariah under Western sanctions linked to the war.

            Volunteer first responders known as the White Helmets have years of experience rescuing people from buildings destroyed by Syrian and Russian airstrikes in the rebel-held enclave, but they say the earthquake has overwhelmed their capabilities.

            Mounir al-Mostafa, the deputy head of the White Helmets, said they were able to respond efficiently to up to 30 locations at a time but now face calls for help from more than 700.

            “Teams are present in those locations, but the available machinery and equipment are not enough,” he said, adding that the first 72 hours were crucial for any rescue effort.

            The United Nations said it was “exploring all avenues” to get supplies to the rebel-held northwest.

            U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said the road leading to the Bab al-Hawa border crossing — the only terminal through which U.N. aid is allowed to enter the rebel-held area — was damaged by the quake, disrupting deliveries.

            Dujarric said the U.N. was preparing a convoy to cross the conflict lines within Syria. 

            The U.N. already delivers aid across conflict lines to the rebel-held enclave. But it can’t move the quantities needed because of difficulties in arranging convoys with opposing parties, making aid deliveries from Turkey critical.

            Syrian President Bashar Assad’s government has pressed for years for all humanitarian aid to be sent from within Syria, including to the opposition-held enclave. The U.N. has increased cross-conflict line deliveries but not enough for the millions in need.

            Turkey has large numbers of troops in the border region and has tasked the military with aiding its rescue efforts, including setting up tents for survivors and a field hospital in Hatay province.

            A navy ship docked Tuesday at the province’s port of Iskenderun, where a hospital collapsed, to transport people in need of medical care to a nearby city.

            A large fire at the port, caused by containers that toppled over during the earthquake, sent thick plumes of black smoke into the sky. The Defense Ministry said the blaze was extinguished with the help of military aircraft, but live footage broadcast by CNN Turk showed it was still burning.

            Vice President Fuat Oktoy said at least 5,894 people have died from the earthquake in Turkey, with another 34,810 injured.

            The death toll in government-held areas of Syria has climbed to 812, with some 1,400 injured, according to the Health Ministry. At least 1,020 people have died in the rebel-held northwest, according to the White Helmets, with more than 2,300 injured.

            The region sits on top of major fault lines and is frequently shaken by earthquakes. Some 18,000 were killed in similarly powerful earthquakes that hit northwest Turkey in 1999.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802691,"Australian, New Zealand leaders' talk focuses on China","CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — Australian and New Zealand prime ministers met Tuesday to talk about China’s importance to their national economies, resolving to voice their disagreements with their most important trading partner that is becoming more assertive in their region.

            New Zealand Prime Minister Chris Hipkins made Australia the destination of his first overseas trip as his government’s leader since his predecessor Jacinda Ardern announced her surprise resignation in January.

            The visit to Australia’s Parliament House comes two weeks after Hipkins assumed office on Jan. 25. He used a joint press conference with his Australian counterpart Anthony Albanese to give an assurance that he was keeping New Zealand’s foreign policy direction.











            “Our foreign policy position hasn’t changed just because there’s a change of prime minister,” Hipkins said. “The government foreign policy is the same as it was under Prime Minister Ardern.”

            A reporter put to Hipkins that Ardern had been reluctant to stand up against “bad behavior by China"" and asked if he was concerned about Chinese coercion in the South Pacific.

            “China is an incredibly important partner for New Zealand, a very important trading partner, and a partner in other areas as well,” Hipkins replied. “That doesn’t mean there aren’t going to be areas where we disagree from time to time, and we’ll continue to voice our disagreements with China when that happens and we’ll always continue to strive to strengthen that ongoing relationship.""

            Albanese said Australia’s national interests include restoring good trade and economic relations with China.

            “Our position on China is clear, that we’ll cooperate where we can, we’ll disagree where we must and we’ll engage in our national interests,” Albanese said.

            Albanese’s center-left government is rebuilding Australia’s trading relationship with China after bilateral ties plumbed new depths under the previous conservative government’s nine years in power.

            Chinese and Australian trade ministers on Monday had their first meeting in more than three years in a major step toward normalizing relations.

            Official and unofficial trade barriers on Australian products including coal, beef, seafood, barley and wood cost Australian exporters 20 billion Australian dollars ($14 billion) a year. The barriers are largely seen as Beijing punishing the previous government for disagreements including Australian demands for an independent inquiry into the origins of and responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.

            Some say New Zealand has avoided such trade retaliation by avoiding criticizing China.

            New Zealand found itself on the defensive with its Five Eyes security allies — United States, Canada, Britain and Australia — in 2021 by resisting speaking out in unison with them against China on certain human rights issues.

            The New Zealand and Australian prime ministers’ talks Tuesday covered their economies, security and climate change. Both countries are also attempting to improve engagement with their South Pacific island neighbors to counter China’s growing influence in the region.

            China made some bold geopolitical moves in 2022 in the Pacific, first by signing a security pact with the Solomon Islands and then attempting — unsuccessfully — to get 10 Pacific nations to sign a sweeping agreement covering everything from security to fisheries.CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — Australian and New Zealand prime ministers met Tuesday to talk about China’s importance to their national economies, resolving to voice their disagreements with their most important trading partner that is becoming more assertive in their region.New Zealand Prime Minister Chris Hipkins made Australia the destination of his first overseas trip as his government’s leader since his predecessor Jacinda Ardern announced her surprise resignation in January.The visit to Australia’s Parliament House comes two weeks after Hipkins assumed office on Jan. 25. He used a joint press conference with his Australian counterpart Anthony Albanese to give an assurance that he was keeping New Zealand’s foreign policy direction.“Our foreign policy position hasn’t changed just because there’s a change of prime minister,” Hipkins said. “The government foreign policy is the same as it was under Prime Minister Ardern.”A reporter put to Hipkins that Ardern had been reluctant to stand up against “bad behavior by China"" and asked if he was concerned about Chinese coercion in the South Pacific.“China is an incredibly important partner for New Zealand, a very important trading partner, and a partner in other areas as well,” Hipkins replied. “That doesn’t mean there aren’t going to be areas where we disagree from time to time, and we’ll continue to voice our disagreements with China when that happens and we’ll always continue to strive to strengthen that ongoing relationship.""Albanese said Australia’s national interests include restoring good trade and economic relations with China.“Our position on China is clear, that we’ll cooperate where we can, we’ll disagree where we must and we’ll engage in our national interests,” Albanese said.Albanese’s center-left government is rebuilding Australia’s trading relationship with China after bilateral ties plumbed new depths under the previous conservative government’s nine years in power.Chinese and Australian trade ministers on Monday had their first meeting in more than three years in a major step toward normalizing relations.Official and unofficial trade barriers on Australian products including coal, beef, seafood, barley and wood cost Australian exporters 20 billion Australian dollars ($14 billion) a year. The barriers are largely seen as Beijing punishing the previous government for disagreements including Australian demands for an independent inquiry into the origins of and responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.Some say New Zealand has avoided such trade retaliation by avoiding criticizing China.New Zealand found itself on the defensive with its Five Eyes security allies — United States, Canada, Britain and Australia — in 2021 by resisting speaking out in unison with them against China on certain human rights issues.The New Zealand and Australian prime ministers’ talks Tuesday covered their economies, security and climate change.
