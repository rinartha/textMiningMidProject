Coxey began leading an “army” of unemployed from Massillon (MA’-sih-luhn), Ohio, to Washington D.C., to demand help from the federal government.In 1911, 146 people, mostly young female immigrants, were killed when fire broke out at the Triangle Shirtwaist Co. in New York.In 1915, the U.S. Navy lost its first commissioned submarine as the USS F-4 sank off Hawaii, claiming the lives of all 21 crew members.In 1947, a coal-dust explosion inside the Centralia Coal Co.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833700,Nepal's newly elected president takes oath of office,"KATHMANDU, Nepal (AP) — Nepal’s newly elected president — the third since the Himalayan nation abolished its centuries-old monarchy in 2008 and became a republic — took the oath of office Monday in Kathmandu.Ram Chandra Poudel was elected Thursday by members of the Federal Parliament and provincial assemblies. Top officials, diplomats and Parliament members lined up to congratulate the new president at the ceremony where the military band played national songs and gave him a salute.Outgoing President Bidhya Devi Bhandari, having completed the maximum two terms in office, passed the position on immediately after the swearing-in ceremony.The president is largely a figurehead with little political power. But the election triggered a feud among partners in the governing alliance headed by Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who took office in December after a hung parliament left a fragile coalition government.Dahal backed Poudel, who is also now the supreme commander of the Nepalese army, angering his main coalition partner, the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist Leninist), which backed Subash Chandra Nembang, its own candidate.The party has since pulled out of the coalition, threatening Dahal’s control.Dahal has since lost the support of three key political parties that were part of his initial coalition government, and must seek a vote of confidence in parliament later in March to continue in power.There was no clear explanation of why Dahal decided to back the opposition candidate and endanger his alliance, but struggles for power among the main political parties are common. The country has had eight different governments in the past 10 years.",2023/3/13,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833701,Cohen testifies before grand jury in Trump hush money probe,"NEW YORK (AP) — Donald Trump’s former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen testified Monday before a Manhattan grand jury investigating hush money payments made on the former president’s behalf.A Trump loyalist turned adversary, Cohen spent around three hours answering questions in the secret proceeding. He is scheduled to return again for more testimony Wednesday, his lawyer said as the pair emerged from the courthouse.“Michael has spent a long and productive afternoon answering all questions, all facts, and completely responsive,” said Cohen’s lawyer, Lanny Davis.The testimony comes at a critical time, as the Manhattan district attorney’s office weighs whether to seek charges against Trump over payments made during his 2016 campaign to two women who alleged affairs or sexual encounters with him.Before entering the courthouse for the session, Cohen, who orchestrated those payoffs, said his goal was simply ""to tell the truth,” dismissing a suggestion that he might be motivated by a desire to see Trump behind bars.“This is not revenge,"" he said. ""This is all about accountability. He needs to be held accountable for his dirty deeds.”Trump denies being involved with either of the women, the porn actor Stormy Daniels and model Karen McDougal.Cohen has given prosecutors evidence, including voice recordings of conversations he had with a lawyer for one of the women, as well as emails and text messages. He also has recordings of a conversation in which he and Trump spoke about an arrangement to pay the other woman through the supermarket tabloid the National Enquirer.Prosecutors appear to be looking at whether Trump committed crimes in how the payments were made or how they were accounted for internally at Trump’s company, the Trump Organization.One possible charge would be falsifying business records, a misdemeanor unless prosecutors could prove it was done to conceal another crime. No former U.S. president has ever been charged with a crime.Appearing Monday on ABC’s ""Good Morning America,” Trump lawyer Joseph Tacopina said it is unlikely the former president will accept an invitation, extended by prosecutors last week, to testify before the grand jury.“We have no plans on participating in this proceeding,” Tacopina said. “It's a decision that needs to be made still. There's been no deadline set, so we'll wait and see.”He characterized Trump as a victim, saying he was pressured into making the payment to Daniels.“This was a plain extortion and I don’t know since when we’ve decided to start prosecuting extortion victims,"" Tacopina said. ""He’s denied — vehemently denied — this affair. But he had to pay money because there was going to be an allegation that was going to be publicly embarrassing to him, regardless of the campaign.”Daniels and the attorney who helped arrange the payment for her, Keith Davidson, have both denied extorting anyone.Speaking briefly to reporters in Moline, Illinois, Trump called the investigation “a big witch hunt.” Asked if he planned on testifying, he said: ""I don't know. Nobody’s even asked me.”Tacopina also wrote a letter to New York City's inspector general, saying prosecutors were trying to hamper Trump’s chances in the 2024 presidential election. Tacopina asked the city's Department of Investigation to probe a “patently political prosecution.”The Manhattan district attorney’s office declined to comment.Trump’s lawyers have tried several times to get judges in New York and Florida to intervene in or halt investigations of Trump and the Trump Organization, arguing that they are politically motivated. All of those attempts have failed.Cohen served prison time after pleading guilty in 2018 to federal charges, including campaign finance violations, for arranging the payouts to Daniels and McDougal to keep them from going public. He has also been disbarred.Trump’s lawyers could point to those factors in an attempt to undermine Cohen's credibility, if the former president is charged and Cohen ends up testifying at trial.Cohen has been meeting regularly with Manhattan prosecutors in recent weeks, including a daylong session Friday to prepare for his grand jury appearance.The panel has been hearing evidence since January in what Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat, has called the “next chapter” of his office’s yearslong Trump investigation. But the hush money payments — perhaps the most salacious of the avenues of inquiry into Trump — are familiar ground.Federal prosecutors and Bragg's predecessor in the DA's office, Cyrus Vance Jr., each scrutinized the payments but didn't charge Trump.Cohen declined to comment to reporters as he left the meeting, saying he’d be “taking a little bit of time now to stay silent and allow the DA build their case.”Trump continued to lash out at the probe on social media on Friday, calling the case a “Scam, Injustice, Mockery, and Complete and Total Weaponization of Law Enforcement in order to affect a Presidential Election!”Cohen paid Daniels $130,000 through his own company and was then reimbursed by Trump, whose company logged the reimbursements as “legal expenses.”McDougal’s $150,000 payment was made through the publisher of the National Enquirer, which squelched her story in a journalistically dubious practice known as “catch-and-kill.”According to federal prosecutors who charged Cohen, the Trump Organization then “grossed up” Cohen’s reimbursement for the Daniels payment for “tax purposes,"" giving him $360,000 plus a $60,000 bonus, for a total of $420,000.___Associated Press writer Jill Colvin contributed to this report.___Follow Michael Sisak on Twitter at twitter.com/mikesisak and send confidential tips by visiting https://www.ap.org/tips/.",2023/3/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833702,India qualify for WTC final after draw vs. Australia,"AHMEDABAD, India (AP) — A tame draw against Australia was enough for India to qualify for the World Test Championship final on Monday, thanks to a more exciting finish in New Zealand.The result in Ahmedabad meant India won the four-test series 2-1 and reclaimed the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, which it has held since 2017.That series margin would only put India into the WTC final if Sri Lanka failed to win its two-test series in New Zealand 2-0, and the Kiwis managed to win the first test on the last ball in a thrilling finish at Christchurch.That means India will face Australia again in the WTC final at the Oval in London from June 7-11.Australia had confirmed its qualification after winning the third test in Indore by nine wickets. India had earlier won the first two tests — in Nagpur by an innings and 132 runs, and in Delhi by six wickets — to maintain its grasp on the series trophy.“It was a fantastic series from the word go,"" India captain Rohit Sharma said. “We knew how important it was to start the series (on a winning note). I am also proud of the win in the Delhi test. Different players put their hands up at different times.”In contrast to the drama at the Hagley Oval in Christchurch, Ahmedabad witnessed a sedate day five.At close of play, Australia had reached 175-2 in its second innings. It had scored 480 runs in the first innings, to which India replied with 571.After lunch on day five, Travis Head completed his first half-century on Indian soil off 112 balls. He went on to score 90 runs, facing 163 deliveries in all, with 10 fours and two sixes.Head added 139 runs with Marnus Labuschagne for the second wicket, and their stand was able to nullify India’s first innings’ lead of 91 runs.Labuschagne reached 50 off 150 balls, and finished with 63 not out.Axar Patel (1-36) bowled Head before the tea break to deny his hundred.Shubman Gill and Cheteshwar Pujara came up to bowl as the last hour of play approached, when the players decided to shake hands. Steve Smith finished unbeaten on 10 runs.“The wicket here was too flat for us to force a result,"" said Smith, the stand-in Australia captain. “The spinners have bowled really well throughout.”The fourth test saw four centuries, bucking the spin-friendly trend of this series. Usman Khawaja (180) and Cameron Green (114) headlined the Australian first innings, while Shubman Gill (128) and Virat Kohli (186) propelled the Indian response. Ashwin took 6-91 in Australia’s first innings.Kohli was named player of the match for scoring his 28th test hundred and breaking a run of 41 test innings without a century, stretching back to November 2019.“I felt I was batting well from the first test,"" Kohli said. “I knew if there was an opportunity on a decent wicket, then I can make a big one. I was able to play the way I wanted to play, which was a relief.”Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja were named joint players of the series. They finished with 25 and 22 wickets, respectively, with Jadeja also scoring a half-century in the first test.The two sides now will meet in a three-match ODI series starting in Mumbai on March 17. ___More AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/13,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833703,"When filling out March Madness bracket, who should you pick?","If you're like most of the country, you probably didn't count on a No. 8 seed reaching the national title game last year — or a No. 15 seed making it to the Elite Eight.Thank you North Carolina and Saint Peter's, who made sure there's nowhere to go but up trying to pick a winning bracket in 2023.This season, of course, picking the March Madness bracket comes with its own set of potential pitfalls. How do you account for injuries at Houston and UCLA? Can defending champ Kansas make another run after losing handily in the Big 12 Tournament final? Is this the year you can trust the Big Ten?Here’s one way to go with the bracket:SOUTH REGIONFirst Four: Texas A&M Corpus Christi over Southeast Missouri State.First round winners: Alabama, West Virginia, San Diego State, Virginia, Creighton, Baylor, Utah State and Arizona.Maryland was terrific at home this season and not very good on the road. At a neutral site, the Terrapins get a tough first-round matchup against a West Virginia team ranked 17th by Ken Pomeroy.Second round winners: Alabama, Virginia, Baylor, Arizona.The seeds hold in round two. Bob Huggins could have some tricks up his sleeve against the Crimson Tide, but Alabama should have an advantage playing in Birmingham.Regional semifinal winners: Alabama, Baylor.Tony Bennett’s Virginia team seems like the ideal group to slow down a run-and-gun team like Alabama, but first the Cavaliers have to get past the first round, which is never a certainty. Time to hedge a bit by putting Virginia in the Sweet 16 but having the Crimson Tide advance.Regional champion: Alabama.The Crimson Tide play fast and shoot a lot of 3s, and they’re also one of the top defensive teams in the country. Turnovers could be an issue, but they have enough different ways to win that they’ll do something their football team couldn’t this year — reach the Final Four.EAST REGIONFirst Four: Texas Southern over Fairleigh Dickinson.First round winners: Purdue, Memphis, Duke, Tennessee, Providence, Kansas State, Southern California, Marquette.At times this season the Big Ten felt like Purdue and about 11 bubble teams. That holds true in the first round of this region, with the Boilermakers advancing but Michigan State bowing out early against USC.Second round winners: Purdue, Tennessee, Kansas State, Marquette.Tennessee-Duke is a marquee second-round matchup between two of the better offensive rebounding teams around. As well as the Blue Devils have played recently, the Volunteers are ranked in the top five by Pomeroy and No. 8 in the country at ShotQuality.com.Regional semifinal winners: Tennessee, Marquette.Zakai Zeigler’s injury will catch up with the Volunteers eventually, but first they oust Purdue, avenging their overtime loss to the Boilermakers in the 2019 Sweet 16. (A refresher: Carsen Edwards was fouled on a 3-pointer in the final seconds and made two free throws to force OT.)Regional champion: Marquette.What a season for Shaka Smart, who coached Marquette to regular-season and tournament titles in the Big East. The Golden Eagles will force turnovers, and unlike some of Smart’s teams in the past, this is an efficient group offensively.MIDWEST REGIONFirst Four: Mississippi State over Pittsburgh.First round winners: Houston, Iowa, Drake, Kent State, Mississippi State, Xavier, Texas A&M, Texas.Yes, that matchup between Texas and Texas A&M in the second round is happening. Also, Drake will be a popular upset pick after rolling through the Missouri Valley Tournament.Second round winners: Houston, Drake, Mississippi State, Texas.Texas is trying to follow in the footsteps of Steve Fisher’s 1989 Michigan team, which won the national title under an interim coach. It’ll be less of a surprise if the Longhorns pull it off, since we’ve already seen them win the Big 12 Tournament under Rodney Terry.Regional semifinal winners: Houston, Mississippi State.Yes, if this comes to fruition, Houston could make the Final Four by beating three double-digit seeds in four games.Regional champion: Houston.Obviously, the groin injury to Marcus Sasser is a big concern, but the Cougars should be able to make it through the first weekend even if he’s not at full strength, and assuming he returns before too long, Houston is the best team in this region.WEST REGIONFirst Four: Nevada over Arizona State.First round winners: Kansas, Illinois, Saint Mary’s, UConn, TCU, Gonzaga, Northwestern, UCLA.Rick Pitino vs. UConn certainly brings back some Big East memories. It’s a tough draw for 13th-seeded Iona.Second round winners: Illinois, Saint Mary’s, Gonzaga, Northwestern.The Big Ten always seems like a polarizing league in this event, so here’s a prediction: Zero Big Ten teams reach the Elite Eight, but Illinois and Northwestern take out the top two seeds in the West. Let the hot takes fly.Regional semifinal winners: Saint Mary’s, Gonzaga.The West Coast Conference’s moment of glory.Regional champion: Gonzaga.The Zags come into this tournament on a roll and without the huge expectations of seasons past. Pencil them in for yet another Sweet 16 — and a Final Four as well.FINAL FOURSemifinal winners: Alabama, Houston.If Alabama makes it this far, the scrutiny may be even more intense for a program that’s been in the news for a lot of the wrong reasons lately. Former Alabama player Darius Miles and another man have been indicted on capital murder charges for the January shooting death of 23-year-old Jamea Harris. A police investigator testified last month that Miles texted Crimson Tide star Brandon Miller to bring him his gun that night. Miller has not been charged and has continued to play.Houston-Gonzaga would be a fascinating matchup, but the Zags still aren’t great defensively. The Cougars are the more well-rounded team.So that would set up an Alabama-Houston title game, with the Crimson Tide happy to push the tempo and the Cougars perfectly comfortable in a rock fight.The Cougars are good enough defensively to beat the Crimson Tide, and 40 years after Phi Slama Jama’s heartbreaking loss to N.C. State in the title game, Houston wins it all.___Follow Noah Trister at https://twitter.com/noahtrister___More AP college basketball: http://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/13,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833704,World Rugby keen to trial 'belly tackles' at non-elite level,"DUBLIN (AP) — Rugby’s world governing body is encouraging its member unions to trial “belly tackles” in the community game in a bid to make the sport safer.World Rugby’s leadership is not ruling out trialing the lowered tackle height in the elite game, too.“The clear mounting evidence is that doing nothing is simply not an option,” World Rugby chief executive Alan Gilpin said in a statement published Monday.The organization’s executive board has recommended, subject to World Rugby Council approval, that national unions consult over lowering the tackle height at non-elite level in a bid to reduce concussions caused by head-on-head contact between a tackler and the ball-carrier.World Rugby’s recommendation is that the height be set below the sternum, which it also refers to as a “belly tackle.”The World Rugby Council will not meet to consider this proposal for approval until May, but World Rugby made the announcement to enable unions to engage in full consultation ahead of their new seasons.The trials will be opt-in, so unions do not have to take part but are encouraged to do so.“Specifically in the community game, head-on-head contact is something we need to reduce,” Gilpin said. “We have to view these proposals as an opportunity to grow the sport at community level in tandem with reducing player risk.”There has been a mixed response globally to initiatives aimed at lowering tackle height.In England, the Rugby Football Union faced widespread criticism after announcing plans in January to ban tackling above the waist from next season in the community game. The RFU apologized for how it had communicated its proposal and has engaged in a fresh period of consultation on the issue.A trial of lowering tackle height to the waist — above the shorts line — was commissioned in the French community game and endorsed by World Rugby in 2019, with some encouraging results.The organization reported a 63% reduction in head-on-head contact and a 16% increase in participation levels. The study also found the change in tackle height enabled ball-carriers to achieve a greater number of offloads, improving the flow of the game.Last year, New Zealand consulted on lowering tackle height to below the sternum, while the Scottish Rugby Union began its consultation on community game tackle height last month.World Rugby attempted to allay fears the changes would make the game only open to players with certain body types.“That definitely is not the intention,” said Mark Harrington, its chief player welfare and rugby services officer. “People say we’re trying to drive the game to the floor. We’re not, we’re just trying to get heads out of the same space.”___More AP rugby: https://apnews.com/hub/rugby and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/13,,World

And by the time he got done with a masterful performance Sunday in The Players Championship, that’s about how it looked.Scheffler ran off five straight birdies in the middle of his round, built a six-shot lead and left all the drama to everyone else on his way to a 3-under 69 to win the richest prize on the PGA Tour by five shots.The victory was worth $4.5 million and sent Scheffler back to No. 1 in the world for the second time this year.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833706,Kimberly Palmer: How to fight the 'pink tax' amid inflation,"Trae Bodge, a shopping expert who lives in the New York City area, sees higher prices for products and services marketed to women everywhere: Socks, razors, shampoo and apparel are a few of the product types aimed at women that tend to cost more.“I don’t know why brands think this is acceptable,” Bodge says. “It’s another punch to the gut as we’re trying to manage our budgets right now,” she adds, referring to rising prices across consumer goods categories due to inflation.The phenomenon known as the “pink tax,” when products and services aimed at women cost more than their counterparts aimed at men, is well-documented across many goods and services. A 2021 paper co-authored by Stephanie Gonzalez Guittar, assistant professor in the sociology department at Rollins College in Florida, found that women pay more for deodorants and lotions, and that personal care products are increasingly differentiated by gender. For example, lotion for women cost an average of $2.97 per ounce compared to $1.86 for men.While Equal Pay Day on March 14 focuses on the pay gap between men and women, it can also be a reminder to consider why being a woman so often comes with a higher price tag — and what to do about it.Here are ways to avoid paying the pink tax.OPT FOR GENDER-NEUTRAL PRODUCTSAs Gonzalez Guittar points out, there is no reason why women need to use lavender scents while men stick with pine. Companies also often market multiple products to women — such as separate shampoo, body wash and conditioner — while marketing a three-in-one product to men.“These are basic hygiene products that don’t need to be gendered,” she says. Shoppers can save by purchasing more generic or gender-neutral products instead of the gendered versions, she says. “Ultimately, (these products) are pigeon-holing what femininity looks and smells like, and that comes at a price.”STUDY THE FINE PRINTGonzalez Guittar urges consumers to take a close look at the ingredients and size information on the packaging to help make more informed decisions before they buy.“Look at the price per ounce, because women’s products tend to be smaller,” she says, and you can often get a better deal by purchasing unscented products in larger quantities instead. At grocery and drugstores, you can often find the unit pricing on the shelf tag in front of the product.COMPARISON SHOP IN ADVANCEIan Ayres, a professor at Yale Law School, first identified that car dealers often offered the best deals to customers who were white men with research in the 1990s. Follow-up studies since then have affirmed the persistence of discriminatory pricing along with some progress, especially at online and no-haggle dealerships, Ayres adds.Consumers can help protect themselves by researching car costs to be more informed negotiators and by checking out financing options in advance.“You can get a competitive interest rate by shopping around and you don’t need to go through the dealerships,” Ayres says.ASK FOR EQUAL PRICINGWhen it comes to services such as dry cleaning or haircuts, men’s prices tend to be lower, but Bodge says they don’t have to be.“If I’m having a cotton oxford shirt cleaned, I just ask for the men’s option, especially if the pricing is posted,” she says. “With haircuts it’s trickier, but if you have a short pixie cut, ask for the men’s price.”KNOW YOUR RIGHTSCalifornia and New York have passed laws against gender-based pricing, which provides a legal recourse for consumers who notice price discrimination based on gender. You can report violations to the New York State Division of Consumer Protection or the California Department of Consumer Affairs . Other states have proposed similar legislation .“We have to look at how we push back with legislation. When we think about economic justice, we often only think of equal pay, but that’s not the only area where women are experiencing economic injustice,” says Christian F. Nunes, president of the National Organization for Women, an advocacy group dedicated to defending women’s rights.“They charge you more, but also underpay you,” says Nunes. “It’s harder to have a sustainable life.”PRIORITIZE SAVINGGiven the wage gap and women’s longer expected lifespans, it’s essential for women to amass savings to get through the post-retirement years, says Cindy Hounsell, president of the Women’s Institute for a Secure Retirement, a nonprofit that advocates for women’s retirement security. “People always say, ‘I wish I had saved more,’” she says.That means leveraging all available work benefits, such as 401(k)s, as well as cutting back on extraneous spending.“It makes a big difference how you spend your money,” she adds. She urges people to use online calculators to figure out how much you will need in retirement so you have a clear goal. “Everyone needs a different amount.”Meanwhile, given the high rates of inflation across many consumer categories, the additional cost of the pink tax only makes it even harder for women to save.Says Bodge: “It’s another hurdle that we need to leap over.”__________________________________This column was provided to The Associated Press by the personal finance website NerdWallet.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833707,Chancellor Scholz proud of German antiwar film's 4 Oscars,"BERLIN (AP) — Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Monday expressed pride that the German antiwar movie “All Quiet on the Western Front” won four Oscars including best international film.“Congratulations on four Oscars!” Scholz tweeted.“It is a huge success for the German film, one can be rightly proud of it,” the German chancellor added. “Especially in these difficult times, it shows unmistakably how terrible and inhumane war is.”The Netflix film starring Austrian actor Felix Kammerer, which was directed and co-written by Edward Berger, also won for cinematography, production design and original score Sunday night.“With four Oscars, ‘All Quiet on the Western Front' sets an unprecedented record for German film,” said Germany’s State Minister for Culture and Media, Claudia Roth. “It will bring German film worldwide attention and give it new significance.”The film is based on the classic 1929 novel of the same name by Erich Maria Remarque. Set during World War I, it follows the life of a young German soldier who enlists in the army with his friends. But the realities of war shatter his hopes of becoming a hero and he focuses on his own survival.The German film shows the horrors of war from the unique perspective of the nation that triggered and lost two world wars.It has an eerie timeliness as young European men are again killing each other in trenches after Russian President Vladimir Putin's army invaded Ukraine last year.“It is also the right film at the right time, as it highlights a war in Europe in all its cruelty and brutality, which is currently raging again in the middle of Europe, triggered by Putin’s criminal attack on Ukraine,” said Roth.Netflix’s adaptation was released in October. It also won seven awards at last month’s BAFTA Film Awards, including the influential ceremony’s best picture honor. It has, since its release, been among the most watched non-English films on Netflix in the U.S., according to the streaming service.“We tried to make a film about our past, about our responsibility in Germany and with our history,” Berger said at the Academy Awards ceremony on Sunday.“Our urge was to talk about our guilt and our shame that we’ve brought and the terror that the two wars have caused in the world,"" he added. ""Hopefully, at some point we will stop making the same mistakes in the future.”",2023/3/13,,World

The brushes are made of carbon and are in contact with the commutator, which is a segmented metal ring that rotates with the armature. As the commutator rotates, the brushes make contact with different segments, causing the current to flow in a specific direction and creating the motor’s rotational motion. Brush motor units are commonly used in small appliances, power tools, and other applications where a compact and efficient motor is required. However, they have some disadvantages, such as limited lifespan due to brush wear and the production of electromagnetic interference.Segmentation is used to segment the global market for Brush Motor Unit by technology, products and forms.

However, there is often traffic congestion on Provincial Highway 14A in the Hehuanshan area as some road sections are narrow and there are only limited parking spaces.Therefore, the Directorate General of Highways (DGH) started to implement high occupancy vehicle (HOV) measures during the rhododendron season last year. This effectively reduced traffic congestion to and from the Hehuan area, Liberty Times reported.This year, the DGH will implement the same measures, requiring every vehicle to have at least three occupants on weekends during the rhododendron season from April 8 to June 15, according to Liberty Times.From 6 to 11 a.m. on weekends during the season, Cuifeng checkpoint at the 18-kilometer mark on Provincial Highway 14Ａ will check eastbound vehicles for HOV compliance, while the 41-kilometer mark eastern checkpoint at Dayuling will check westbound vehicles, according to Liberty Times.

""I look forward to him presenting our coverage this coming weekend,"" he said.Lineker is the longtime host of the ""Match of the Day"" program and the row over his suspension even compelled Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to comment on the matter last week.“I hope that the current situation between Gary Lineker and the BBC can be resolved in a timely manner, but it is rightly a matter for them, not the government,"" Sunak said last week.The suspension renewed the focus on BBC chairman Richard Sharp who has been under fire after failing to declare that he had helped broker a loan for former Prime Minister Boris Johnson shortly before he was appointed to the role by the government.Lineker said he was ""glad that we have found a way forward.""""I have been presenting sport on the BBC for almost three decades and am immeasurably proud to work with the best and fairest broadcaster in the world,"" he said.Still, he added, ""A final thought: however difficult the last few days have been, it simply doesn't compare to having to flee your home from persecution or war to seek refuge in a land far away. It's heartwarming to have seen the empathy towards their plight from so many of you.""rm/rc (Reuters, AP)",2023/3/13,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833761,Japan orders retrial of man sentenced to death in 1968,"Tokyo's High Court on Monday ordered a retrial for former boxer Iwao Hakamada, who became known as the longest-serving death row inmate in the world.The 87-year-old was convicted of murder in 1968. He is believed to be the world's longest-serving death row inmate.Hakamada spent nearly five decades on death row before a lower court ordered a retrial and freed him while his case proceeded.He was handed a death sentence for robbing and murdering his boss, the man's wife and their two teenage children.Hakamada initially denied the allegations and later presented a confession to police. But the former boxer claims that this followed a brutal interrogation that included beatings.According to the Japan Times daily, interrogations lasted for an average of 12 hours each day. In Japan, suspects are not permitted to have a lawyer present during interrogations.Following the sentence, Hakamada attempted to retract his confession, but it was confirmed in 1980.In 2014, a district court in the central city of Shizuoka found that investigators could have planted evidence and granted a retrial.Tokyo's High Court overturned the lower court ruling in 2016. Four years later, the country's Supreme Court ruled that the High Court must reconsider its decision.One key piece of evidence used to convict Hakamada was a set of blood-stained clothes found in a miso barrel more than a year after the murder and robbery.According to the Japan Times, the defense team has argued they must have been planted, as they would have been discolored after being in a miso barrel for more than a year.The NHK broadcaster said the court's presiding judge cast doubt on the evidence's credibility.""There is no evidence other than the clothes that could determine Hakamada was the perpetrator, so it is clear that reasonable doubt arises,"" he said.Lawyers for Iwao Hakamada unfurled banners reading ""retrial,"" while supporters shouted ""Free Hakamada now!""Hideko Hakamada, who is the former boxer's sister, said: ""I was waiting for this day for 57 years and it has come.""""Finally a weight has been lifted from my shoulders.""Hideaki Nakagawa, Director of Amnesty International Japan, called the ruling a ""long-overdue chance to deliver some justice to Hakamada Iwao.""Nakagawa said that Hakamada spent ""more than half a century under sentence of death despite the blatant unfairness of the trial that saw him convicted.""This report was written in part with material from Agence France-Presse.Edited by: Richard Connor",2023/3/13,,

messaging platform.""All enemy attempts to capture the town are repelled by artillery, tanks, and other firepower,"" Syrskyi said and went on to say that forces from Russian private military company Wagner Group ""are attacking from several directions trying to break through the defenses of our troops and advance to the central districts of the town.""Wagner meanwhile said: ""the enemy is battling for every meter, the closer we are to the city center, the harder the battles"".DW is not able to independently verify the claims.Over the weekend, British military intelligence reported that units from the Wagner Group had captured most of eastern Bakhmut, with a river flowing through the city center now marking the front line.Wagner has been spearheading offensives in eastern Ukraine, in what has become the longest and bloodiest fight of Russia's yearlong assault. Both sides have suffered heavy losses around the city.Here are some of the other notable developments concerning the war on Monday, March 13:Talks aimed at discussing an extension to a deal allowing export of grain from Ukraine are taking place according to a report from Reuters, citing Russia's diplomatic mission in Geneva.The deal, which was brokered by the UN and Turkey, is up for renewal on March 18.Last week UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres highlighted the importance of the deal to global food security and food prices, amid calls from Ukraine for an extension.Reuters reported that UN trade official Rebeca Grynspan and head of aid Martin Griffiths, had arrived at UN European headquarters in Geneva but did not make any comments.More than 24.1 million tons have been exported under the initiative, according to the UN.Its likely that Russian private military company, the Wagner Group, has lost access to prisons as part of its recruitment strategy and will now likely shift focus towards recruiting ordinary Russians, the UK's Ministry of Defence (MOD) said in its latest intelligence update.The MOD pointed out that this was due to Wagner group head, Yevgeny Prigozhin's ""ongoing disputes with the Russian MoD leadership.""According to the MOD, masked Wagner recruiters were giving career talks at high schools in Moscow, and were handing out questionnaires titled ""application a young warrior.""The MOD said that half of the prisoners Wagner had deployed in Ukraine had likely become casualties, and the new recruitment strategy was a possible way of making up for the loss of convict recruits.The ban on recruiting from prisons could also result in Wagner reducing the scale of its operations in Ukraine.The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) says European arms imports have almost doubled in 2022.Shipments of arms to Ukraine are driving the increase in numbers with a 93% spike seen when compared with the previous year.SIPRI  also says that imports have jumped due to a hike in military spending from European states.""The invasion has really caused a significant surge in demand for arms in Europe, which will have further effect and most likely will lead to increased arms imports by European states,"" Pieter Wezeman, a senior researcher at SIPRI, told the AFP news agency.According to SIPRI's data, Ukraine accounted for 31% of arms transfers to Europe.SIPRI's estimated figures for military expenditure in 2022 will be released in April.The rights group Human Rights Watch (HRW) says Russia's war in Ukraine is severely traumatizing children, specifically those living in orphanages.The HRW report released on Monday says there are more than 105,000 children living in residential institutions — the largest number in Europe after Russia.""Ukrainian children who were housed in Soviet-era institutions now face extreme risks due to Russia's war on Ukraine,"" said Bill Van Esveld, associate director at HRW.""There needs to be a concerted international effort to identify and return children who were deported to Russia, and Ukraine and its allies should ensure that all children who were or remain institutionalized are identified and provided with support to live with their families and in communities.""HRW pointed out that many more children will be orphaned as a result of the war.The watchdog said that it had also documented Russia's forced transfer of children from residential institutions to Russian-occupied territory, which is a war crime.The report also highlighted the mental trauma displaced children were experiencing and pointed out shortcomings in care due to insufficient caregivers.Ukraine's military says Russia is using hypersonic missiles in attacks that have been launched on targets across the country.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833764,Japan's Nobel-winning novelist Kenzaburo Oe dies,"Nobel Prize winner Kenzaburo Oe — known for his books on pacifism and his disabled son — died earlier this month, on March 3, in Japan , a statement released by publisher Kodansha said.In 1994, Oe became the second Japanese author to win the Nobel Prize in Literature, after Kawabata Yasunari.Family members have already held the funeral of the writer, who died of old age, the publisher confirmed.Born in the village of Shikoku, Oe was raised by his mother after his father died in World War II.Japan's involvement in the Second World War left a lasting impact on Oe, who was ten years old at the end of the conflict. The democratic ideology of the American forces inspired him. According to Oe, he belonged to a generation of writers who were ""deeply wounded"" by the war ""yet full of hope for a rebirth.""Oe then went on to study French Literature at Tokyo University. There, he started to publish stories as a student. He won the Akutagawa Prize — an award for young authors — in 1958 for his fiction book ""The Catch,"" in which he wrote about an American pilot captured by Japanese villagers during the war.In an interview in 2014, he said that he believed Japan held ""some"" responsibility in the war.""This war, in which so many large powers were involved, caused great suffering for people all over the world... And it is a reality that within this immense war, nuclear weapons were created and used,"" he said.He also turned down an award by the emperor — Japan's Order of Culture Award — in 1994. ""I would not recognize any authority, any value, higher than democracy,"" he said, clarifying his stance to The New York Times.Later in his life, the writer also arranged several anti-nuclear protests. He criticized the country's former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on his attempts to revise the country's pacifist constitution.Oe's most notable works were inspired by his son, who was born in 1963 with a cranial deformity that resulted in a mental disability.His book ""A Personal Matter"" was published a year after the birth in which the author wrote about his struggles with accepting his son's disability.The Nobel committee described Oe as an author ""who with poetic force creates an imagined world, where life and myth condense to form a disconcerting picture of the human predicament today.”aa/rc  (ap, Reuters, afp)",2023/3/13,,

KUALA LUMPUR, MALAYSIA -  Media OutReach - 13 March 2023 -  Hong Leong Bank's (""HLB"" or ""the Bank"") new data center has received a Titanium+ Tier nod from the  Green Climate Initiative (""GCI""), an industry-leading green technology accreditation organisation. With this accreditation, the Bank's data center is officially a  Certified Green Computing Facility and the only facility in Malaysia to achieve the prestigious Titanium+ ranking by scoring a near-perfect 99 out of 100 points in the Certified Green Computing Facility (""CGCF"") Weighted Scorecard.        HLB's Chief Technology Officer William Streitberg receiving the Titanium+ Tier Certification from Green Climate Initiative's (GCI) Avis Tan, Head of Sustainability Committee (Asia & Middle East), flanked by Huawei Enterprise Business Group, Financial Services Industry Director G.T Tan      This accreditation, which was presented at the  Huawei Malaysia Digital Power Summit 2023, comes as the Bank continues to execute its strategic ESG initiatives, working towards its goal of being carbon neutral by 2050. In recent years, the Bank has gradually embedded ESG considerations throughout its business operations by implementing sustainability and environmental frameworks as part of its business strategy. The Bank's new data center, which uses open-source, latest data governance architecture to enable real-time data processing, data mining, and in-depth analysis, was developed in line with the Bank's overall ESG framework.   According to  Domenic Fuda, Group Managing Director and CEO of HLB, climate change will remain the most profound generational challenge which the world faces today as well as a key emerging risk for financial institutions over the next few years, given the increased regulation, demands for transparency and the need for whole ecosystems to embrace the need for action now so that future impacts of climate change can be appropriately and effectively managed.   ""We take both a short-term, as well as, a long-term view when it comes to addressing climate change by being steadfast in incorporating sustainability actions and policies into our daily operations and strategic initiatives. These initiatives and actions throughout our business are designed to create a positive impact across our customers, community and the environment, whether it's in business enablers like a data center or through our products and services that customers use. This certification from GCI is a testament to our commitment to putting sustainability at the core of our operations. We are proud to have the first Titanium+ tiered data facility in Malaysia,"" said Fuda.   Operationally, HLB has set the target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 15% to 25% by 2026, achieving net zero Scope 1 and 2 by 2030 and being carbon neutral by 2050. Some key initiatives that are aligned with these ESG commitments include:     Business and Corporate Banking Credit Policy and ESG Assessment Framework which takes an inclusionary approach to transition customers in high-risk sectors to adopt lower-carbon economic activities.     Developer End Financing Framework encourages property developers to adopt greener practices as those with green certifications for their development projects will be classified with low ESG risk profiles.     Regional Wealth Management ESG Framework guides the creation of responsible wealth management products with integrated ESG considerations.     Procurement Policy assesses the level of ESG adoption for its vendors across the entire value chain through the Bank's Vendor Sustainability Self-Assessment.     Environmental Policy on Energy, Water and Waste Management monitors electricity and water consumption as well as manages waste and recycling measures. Accordingly, HLB has introduced bank-wide Energy Efficiency & Conservation (EE&C) initiatives to upgrade and retrofit its operational facilities.     Ceased financing of any greenfield coal-fired power plants beginning 1st July 2021 and new financing of all coal-fired power plants effective 1st July 2026.     Forest rehabilitation and conservation practices via its 15-hectare mangrove rehabilitation project in Kuala Selangor Nature Park, having so far planted over 40,000 trees, to offset carbon emissions, prevent soil erosion and assist the fishing ecosystem to help fishermen's livelihoods and the HLB Earth Hero initiative which nurtures an environmentally responsible younger generation, whilst replanting trees in a forest in Sabah.      HLB's new Data Centre is powered by Huawei Module Data Center which delivers simple and flexible deployment and expansion and most importantly, a self-optimisation system that reduces energy consumption and carbon footprint. For the successful deployment and attaining Malaysia's first Titanium+ certification from GCI, Huawei also presented the Bank with the ""Excellence Customer of Module Data Center"" award under the Deployment in Finance Category 2022.   Vice President of Digital Power Business Group of Huawei Malaysia, Chong Chern Peng said, ""We are grateful that our customer Hong Leong Bank has received this certification and recognition for Huawei's Data Center Facility. In the pursuit of Next-Generation Data Centers, technological innovation will be a key force in ensuring sustainable development. Looking towards the future, Huawei will keep making breakthroughs in products and technologies through continuous investments in R&D and through extensive cooperation with customers, ecosystem partners, and industry organisations. Together, we can jointly usher in a new era of data center development"".  Hashtag: #HongLeongBank

Pfizer then plans to let the biotech drug developer “continue innovating,” except with more resources than it would have alone, Pfizer Chairman and CEO Albert Bourla told analysts.“We are not buying the golden eggs,” he said. “We are acquiring the goose that is laying the golden eggs.”Bothell, Washington-based Seagen Inc. specializes in working with antibody-drug conjugate, or ADC, technology. Its key products use lab-made proteins called monoclonal antibodies that seek out cancer cells to help deliver a cancer-killing drug while sparing surrounding tissue.Cancer treatments are a priority for Pfizer. They brought in $12 billion in revenue for the drugmaker last year. But Pfizer has only marketed a couple first-generation ADC treatments, a spokeswoman said.Seagen has four treatments on the market. It also has a pipeline of drugs under development that includes potential treatments for a form of lung cancer and advanced breast cancer.“We think this really changes dramatically the oncology presence of Pfizer, makes it one of a kind,"" Bourla said.Seagen’s top seller, Adcetris, treats lymph system cancers. It brought in $839 million in sales last year, a 19% increase over the previous year.Seagen also has a deal with Pfizer’s Array BioPharma to develop, make and sell the breast and colorectal cancer treatment Tukysa. It brought in $353 million in sales for Seagen last year.The company, which changed its name from Seattle Genetics in 2020, saw total revenue grow about 25% last year to nearly $2 billion. Seagen also shaved its loss to $610 million from $674 million in 2021.The drug developer predicts about $2.2 billion in sales for this year.Pfizer booked about $100 billion in total revenue last year and has been flush with cash thanks to sales of its COVID-19 vaccine and treatment, Comirnaty and Paxlovid.Bourla said earlier this year that the company planned to use its “extraordinary firepower” to buy products that will deliver $25 billion in incremental revenue by 2030.The deal announced Monday and some previous acquisitions will help Pfizer account for most of that. But Bourla emphasized on Monday that the company expects Seagen's contributions to extend beyond the end of the decade.New York-based Pfizer Inc. has already spent $11.6 billion on migraine treatment developer Biohaven Pharmaceutical. It also spent $5.4 billion on sickle cell disease treatment maker Global Blood Therapeutics and bought Arena Pharmaceuticals for another $6.7 billion.The drugmaker needs more revenue sources in part because it faces the expiration of patents protecting drugs like its breast cancer treatment Ibrance from cheaper competition in the coming years.Pfizer said Monday it will pay for Seagen mostly through $31 billion in new, long-term debt.Both companies' boards have unanimously approved the deal. But regulators still need to look at it, and Seagen shareholders will have to approve it.The companies expect to complete the transaction in late 2023 or early 2024.Shares of Pfizer rose 2% to $40.26 after markets opened Monday, while Seagen's stock soared more than 15% to nearly $200.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833787,Spanish government to side against Barcelona over payments,"MADRID (AP) — The Spanish government's top sports authority will take action against Barcelona in the legal proceedings the club is facing for its payments of millions of dollars over several years to a company that belonged to the vice president of the country's refereeing committee, an official said Monday.José Manuel Franco, president of Spain's sports council, said on channel Telecinco that the government will join the other accusing parties in the legal proceedings against the club.The council is the latest to announce plans to act after prosecutors on Friday formally accused Barcelona of alleged corruption, fraudulent management and falsification of documentation. An investigating judge will decide whether the accusations should lead to charges.Real Madrid announced after an urgent board meeting Sunday it will also side against its biggest rival, becoming the latest club to express concerns about the case. The Spanish league and the Spanish soccer federation also planned to act.Barcelona has been under scrutiny since the payments to the vice president of the refereeing committee became public last month. Barcelona has denied any wrongdoing or conflict of interest, saying it paid for technical reports on referees but never tried to influence their decisions in games.Club president Joan Laporta said Sunday that Barcelona was “innocent of the accusations” and was “the victim of a campaign, that now involves everyone, to harm its honorability.” He said ”many will be forced to rectify.”Prosecutors said in court documents seen by The Associated Press that the payments by the club totaled as much as 7.3 million euros ($7.7 million) from 2001-18. They added that this “quantity was not justified because it was not foreseen in the statutes of the club nor approved by its general assembly (of club members).”There is so far no evidence that referees or game results were actually influenced during the period in which Barcelona made the payments.Barcelona increased its Spanish league lead to nine points over Real Madrid on Sunday after an equalizer by Athletic Bilbao was disallowed by video review following a controversial handball in the buildup.___Tales Azzoni on Twitter: http://twitter.com/tazzoni___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/13,,World

The militant group has increased its attacks in Afghanistan since the Taliban takeover of the country in August 2021. IS attacks have also included Taliban patrols.IS said in a statement posted on its media arm, the Aamaq news agency, that the explosives were planted in a bag that was left hidden at the center. The statements said those targeted work for an establishment “that engaged in war"" against IS.Abdul Nafi Takor, the Taliban-appointed spokesman for the interior ministry said the person killed was a security guard at the center. Three children were among the eight wounded.The attack on the center came two days after a bombing in Mazar-e-Sharif killed the provincial governor, Daud Muzmal, and two others.

Something I will keep. Very cool. Something I’ll cherish and never forget.”For Satoria — the Czech pitcher's first name is pronounced Andre — there's the memory of striking out Ohtani on three pitches in Saturday's 10-2 loss to Japan. In fact, he struck out three of Japan's first four batters.Satoria recounted all three pitches, the last a change-up in the dirt that Ohtani almost lost his helmet chasing.Satoria kept the ball, too, but what he didn't get was Ohtani's signature on it. Satoria said he tried through a clubhouse attendant to make contact with the Angels two-way star.“It didn't work,” Satoria said, explaining the request perhaps did not reach the Los Angeles Angels star.“But it doesn't matter,” he added. “I've got the ball and it's really cool.”Satroia, who said he works back home as an “electric technician"" and is an amateur like all the Czech players, took dirt from the mound and put it into a glass container, and he'll be looking for a place to display the memories.“I'm not sure yet. Maybe in the living room,” he said. “Everybody will want to see it.”___Follow Japan-based AP Sports Writer Stephen Wade on Twitter at http://twitter.com/StephenWadeAP___AP MLB coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833793,Retrial ordered for 87-year-old ex-boxer on Japan death row,"TOKYO (AP) — Tokyo’s high court on Monday ordered a retrial for an 87-year-old former boxer who has been on death row for more than five decades after his murder conviction that his lawyers said was based on forced confession and fabricated evidence.The Tokyo High Court said Iwao Hakamada deserves a retrial because of a possibility that a key evidence that led to his conviction could have been fabricated by investigators, according to a statement from the Japan Bar Association.Amnesty International says Hakamada is the world’s longest-serving death row prisoner.He has been temporarily released since 2014, but still not cleared of charges, when the Shizuoka District Court in central Japan suspended his execution and ordered a retrial. That ruling was overturned by the Tokyo High Court until the Supreme Court in 2020 ordered the lower court to reconsider.His defense lawyers rushed out of the courtroom and flashed banners saying “Retrial.”“We won his retrial. I’m so glad, and that’s all I can say,” said his 90-year-old sister Hideko, who has devoted her life to prove her brother's innocence.Hakamada was convicted of murder in the 1966 killing of a company manager and three of his family members, and setting fire to their central Japan home, where he was a live-in employee. He was sentenced to death two years later. He initially denied the accusations then confessed, which he later said he was forced to because of violent interrogation by police.Hakamada was not executed because of lengthy appeals and the retrial process. It took 27 years for the Supreme Court to deny his first appeal for a retrial. He filed a second appeal in 2008, and the court finally ruled in his favor on Thursday.The point of contention was five pieces of blood-stained clothing that investigators said Hakamada allegedly wore during the crime and hid in a tank of fermented soybean paste, or miso, found more than a year after his arrest.The Tokyo High Court decision on Monday acknowledged scientific experiments that clothing soaked in miso for more than a year turns too dark for blood stains to be spotted, saying there is a possibility of fabrication, most likely by investigators.Defense lawyers and earlier retrial decisions said the blood samples did not match Hakamada's DNA, and trousers that prosecutors submitted as evidence were too small for Hakamada and did not fit when he tried them on.Hakamada has been serving his sentence at home since his release in 2014 because his frail health and age made him a low risk for escape.Japan and the United States are the only two countries in the Group of Seven advanced nations that retain capital punishment. A survey by the Japanese government showed an overwhelming majority of the public support executions.Executions are carried out in secrecy in Japan and prisoners are not informed of their fate until the morning they are hanged. Since 2007, Japan has begun disclosing the names of those executed and some details of their crimes, but disclosures are still limited.Supporters say Hakamada’s mental health has suffered because of his nearly half-century detention, mostly in solitary confinement, in fear of execution. He spent a total of 48 years in prison, more than 45 of them on death row.",2023/3/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833794,'Scream VI' tops box office with franchise-best $44.5M,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Oscar weekend belonged to “Scream VI"" in theaters, as the horror sequel notched a franchise-best $44.5 million in domestic ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday.The Paramount Pictures and Spyglass Media Group co-production sailed past expectations, easily surpassing the previous series high of $32 million that “Scream 2” opened with in 1997. The film's robust debut, coming as Hollywood prepared to gather for the 95th Academy Awards, was yet another reminder of how horror has come to be one of the industry's few sure things at the box office.After lying dormant for more than a decade, the “Scream” franchise, previously directed by Wes Craven and released by Dimension Films, has found a ripe revival with a young cast led by “Wednesday” star Jenna Ortega and Melissa Barrera.Directors Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett have brought back the 27-year-old series' meta slasher storylines and serial killer Ghostface, and it's paying off. Last year's “Scream V” grossed $137 million worldwide on a production budget of $24 million. In the latest chapter, Courtney Cox returns as reporter Gale Weathers, as does Hayden Panettiere, a veteran of “Scream IV.” But it's the first “Scream” movie without Neve Campbell.“Scream VI,” quickly greenlit after the success of “V,” has also fared fairly well with both critics and audiences. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has a 75% fresh rating. Moviegoers gave it a “B+” CinemaScore, a decent grade for a horror film. The sixth “Scream,” which cost $33 million to make, added $22.6 million overseas.Last week's top film, “Creed III,” slid to second after its above-expectations launch. Michael B. Jordan's MGM “Rocky” spinoff, starring him and Jonathan Majors, earned $27.1 million in its second weekend. It has rapidly passed $100 million in U.S. and Canadian theaters.Columbia Pictures’ “65,”  a science-fiction thriller starring Adam Driver as a space explorer stranded on prehistoric Earth, opened in third place with an estimated $12.3 million from 3,405 locations, and an additional $7.2 million internationally. That might be better than expected, too, for a film that got terrible reviews from critics. (It scored just 35% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes.) But “65” reportedly carried a hefty production budget of about $90 million, though tax rebates roughly halved that cost to financiers including Sony, Bron Studios and TSG.Bobby Farrelly's “Champions,"" starring Woody Harrelson as a disgraced coach trying to lead a basketball team to the Special Olympics, opened with $5.2 million in 3,030 locations. Audiences (an “A” CinemaScore) have liked it more than reviewers (53% on Rotten Tomatoes).Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday.1. “Scream VI,” $44.5 million.2. “Creed III,” $27.1 million.3. “65,” $12.3 million.4. “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,” $7 million.5. “Cocaine Bear,” $6.2 million.6. “Jesus Revolution,” $5.2 million.7. “Champions,” $5.2 million.8. “Avatar: The Way of Water,” $2.7 million.9. “Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba: To the Swords,” $1.9 million.10. “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,” $1.7 million.",2023/3/13,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833795,Trump returns to Iowa aiming for more disciplined campaign,"DAVENPORT, Iowa (AP) — To outsiders, they looked like simple stacks of paper. But for Donald Trump's first presidential campaign, they represented a missed opportunity.A month before Iowa's 2016 presidential caucuses, mountains of so-called pledge cards sat in the corner of Trump's suburban Des Moines state headquarters. They contained the names and contact information of roughly 10,000 Iowans who attended Trump campaign events and responded by returning the cards suggesting they were open to backing the reality television star who was now seeking the White House.In what's considered political malpractice by Iowa standards, those who returned the cards received no follow-up contact from the campaign.“None of that data was used. None of it was entered,” said Alex Latcham, the former political director for the Iowa Republican Party and now Trump's early-voting state director. “And those people weren’t encouraged or mobilized to caucus.”As Trump returned to Iowa on Monday, he and his team aimed for a more disciplined approach, focused on connecting with voters on a more personal level while building the data and digital engagement he will need to persuade Iowans to traipse through the cold and snow early next year to participate in the caucuses.He's also intensifying his attacks against his chief Republican rival, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.From the stage of a packed theater in downtown Davenport, Trump likened DeSantis to Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, a frequent punching bag for the Make America Great Again movement. Trump also charged that DeSantis voted against Medicare and Social Security while a congressman, calling him “a disciple of Paul Ryan, who was a RINO loser.” The acronym stands for ”Republican in name only.""A spokesman for DeSantis did not immediately respond to a request for comment.At the same time, Trump is trying to project supreme confidence. He downplayed his political challenge ahead of his speech while talking to reporters when asked how aggressively he'd need to work to win the state in 2024.“I wouldn’t think I’d have to be really too aggressive,” Trump said. “We’ve done a good job for the farmers. No president has ever done more for the farmers than I have.”In the early phase of the 2024 campaign, Trump remains in a dominant position. But he faces notable challenges, including growing interest in the expected candidacy of DeSantis, who made his debut swing through Iowa last week.Early polls show Trump remains widely popular among Iowa Republicans, though views of the former president have slipped somewhat since he left the White House. Now, 80% say they have a favorable rating of Trump, down slightly from 91% in September 2021, according to a Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll released Friday.The poll found DeSantis also gets a rosy review from Iowa Republicans, with 74% saying they have a favorable rating. Notably, DeSantis has high name recognition in a state over 1,000 miles away from his own; just 20% say they aren’t sure how to rate him.Meanwhile, legal scrutiny surrounding Trump is also intensifying with potential indictments in the coming weeks that would make him the first former president in U.S. history to face criminal charges. He has been invited to testify this week before a New York grand jury that has been investigating hush money payments made on his behalf during the 2016 campaign, a move that often indicates a decision on indictments is near.He told reporters Monday that he wasn't sure whether he'd testify or not.“I don’t know. Nobody’s even asked me,"" he said. “It’s all a big witch hunt. It’s run by Democrats, radical left Democrats. It’s a disgrace. It ended years ago. Nothing happened. Take a look at extortion. Because that’s what it is. But it’s a way they try and win elections. It’s a disgrace.”Elsewhere, the district attorney in Atlanta has said decisions are “imminent” in a two-year investigation into possible illegal meddling in the 2020 election by Trump and his allies. A Justice Department special counsel is also investigating efforts by Trump and his allies to undo the election as well as the handling of classified documents at his Florida estate.The dynamics make the stakes particularly high for Trump in Iowa. As a former president who boasts of his standing atop the GOP, he can’t afford even a narrow loss in the contest that kicks off the nomination process.And even the most sophisticated data and digital operation may not be enough to satisfy some Iowans, who are accustomed to having intimate conversations with those seeking the White House. Iowa GOP activists say Trump would do well to hold smaller events, including with influential local Republican leaders.Trump did some things differently as he reintroduced himself to Iowa voters.Before his speech, Trump briefly stopped at the Machine Shed Restaurant, posing for pictures with unsuspecting diners and making small talk with wait staff. The former president devoted little time to such “retail politics” in past campaigns.And after talking up his record in a self-described education policy speech that barely mentioned education for more than an hour inside a packed Davenport theater, he took several unscripted questions from voters — a common practice for traditional presidential contenders in states like Iowa and New Hampshire, but something the former president has rarely done.Trump's campaign said it had collected nearly 8,000 names, addresses and emails of would-be supporters related to Monday's event. Before the speech, the campaign also rolled out a list of endorsements from eastern Iowa elected officials, including state representatives and state senators.When he began his Iowa campaign eight years ago, Trump was unsure what a caucus even was. The quirky contests — more than 1,000 simultaneous, local political meetings sponsored by the state Republican Party and run by volunteers — are not state-sanctioned primary elections and require intense organization to have supporters in place at each location.While Trump's celebrity drew crowds of sometimes several thousand to his rallies around the state, there was almost no follow-through with interested supporters. Many of Trump's supporters were first-time caucus prospects unfamiliar with the process. Some missed their chance to weigh in by wrongly going to their typical voting polling place, rather than the designated party caucus site.The goal of a sharper Iowa approach reflects broader changes to how Trump has structured his latest campaign. While his 2016 bid was a scrappy upstart bid, with a national headquarters in unfinished commercial space at Trump Tower in New York, his second campaign, as a president seeking reelection, was a sprawling behemoth run out of a shiny Virginia office tower.Both were riven by rivalries as Trump cycled through top staff.This time, Trump has chosen a middle-of-the-road approach and eschewed the traditional hierarchy. Instead of a campaign manager, he has entrusted Florida operative Susie Wiles, a longtime adviser, to lead his Florida-based operation, joined by LaCivita and former White House political director Brian Jack.The campaign has been rapidly adding staff and is quickly outgrowing its office space.Voters in Iowa are only just beginning to see those changes up close. And some of the state's top Republican officials are undecided.Gov. Kim Reynolds attended a private donor summit with DeSantis in Florida late last month. She introduced DeSantis when he appeared in the state last week. On Monday, she introduced Trump.Asked whether he had Reynolds' support in 2024, Trump said: “I imagine. I supported her.”___Associated Press writers Jill Colvin in New York and Hannah Fingerhut in Washington contributed to this report.",2023/3/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833796,Marozsán ends Germany soccer career before World Cup,"FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — Former Germany captain Dzsenifer Marozsán said Monday she is retiring from international soccer before this year's Women's World Cup because she is still feeling the effects of a serious knee injury.The 30-year-old midfielder scored the winning goal in the 2016 Olympic final as Germany beat Sweden 2-1. Last year she missed the Champions League final with Lyon and Germany's run to the European Championship final after tearing her anterior cruciate ligament while playing a World Cup qualification game against Serbia.“I'm doing well for my club once again but the knee is not like it used to be,” Marozsán said in a statement. ""I have to do an enormous amount of work to be able to manage all of the training sessions and games. I believe it would just be too much to do international games, preparation and the tournament as well.""The German soccer federation said Marozsán will play her 112th and last game for her country in a friendly against Brazil next month. The World Cup begins July 20 in Australia and New Zealand.The Hungary-born Marozsán's international retirement comes amid concern over the number of ACL injuries at the top level of women's soccer.England’s European Championship top scorer Beth Mead called for more research into the issue after tearing her ACL in December. Other leading players to have been affected in the past 12 months include Spain's Alexia Putellas, who is the FIFA women's player of the year, two-time World Cup winner Christen Press of the United States, and Netherlands forward Vivianne Miedema.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/13,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833797,Insider Q&A-Nintendo's Bowser,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — With a new theme park attraction opened last month, an upcoming major motion picture and the sequel to a massive hit video game about to be released, everything’s coming up Nintendo.Doug Bowser, the head of Nintendo USA since 2019, spoke to The Associated Press at Universal Studios Hollywood’s Super Nintendo World in Los Angeles before its Feb. 17 grand opening. Q: You’ve got a new movie (“The Super Mario Bros. Movie,” April 7), this new attraction at Universal, and the new Legend of Zelda game (“Tears of the Kingdom,” May 12). What's next, a prestige streaming TV show?A: You’re hitting on something which is really important. This is a milestone, what you’re seeing here with Super Nintendo World. Universal Studios is a great partner to allow us to do Super Nintendo World. I won’t comment on your question regarding a streaming show. But it really is a reflection on this ability to share our IP with people well outside of the video game space.Q: The new attraction I was able to see today is really impressive. Could there ever be an entire theme park build around Nintendo characters, like Disneyland?A: Well, we’ve got a great partner with Universal Studios. I think we have packed a lot of exciting and fun stuff. Even with the size of the park here, you can spend hours just exploring, finding little Easter eggs, little treasures. If you load the app on your phone you can actually keep score, it’s very much like being in a video game, with the ability to play in a linear way but then also wander around and explore.Q: Would you say video games are now the dominant force in entertainment?A: They’re clearly a prominent form of entertainment right now. As we came through and out of the pandemic, they became an incredible source if you will, of people’s entertainment. We saw very nice growth in the industry over the last few years with people looking for different forms to entertain themselves at home, either as an individual online or with the family. So I do think it’s a form of entertainment going forward that people will continue to choose.Q: What other characters besides the Mario Bros. would you like to develop new films or attractions around? Full disclosure, I’ve got a Donkey Kong tattoo, I’d be thrilled with a Donkey Kong movie for example.A: That really is a call for the creative groups here at Universal Studios and of course, Nintendo. If you think about park experiences, we have announced that at the Universal Studios in Osaka that will be expanding that land to include Donkey Kong. There’s a whole new Donkey Kong area being built out with its primary feature being a roller coaster. You can just imagine what a Donkey Kong roller coaster might be like! We have announced that we are working on other video projects but we’re not at the point where we want to talk about what these characters are. I could share my favorites, but that probably wouldn’t be appropriate. If you’ve noticed with the new Super Mario Bros. movie, Seth Rogen does play Donkey Kong. So Donkey Kong is a part of the movie. So look forward to that!Q: Is there any date for the Nintendo attractions at Universal Studios in Orlando and Singapore? Will they be bigger, different?A: No date on Singapore. Orlando is a couple years in the future. You’ll have to wait and see. You can assume, if you look at Orlando, it’s got a lot of land, so it’s likely a bigger footprint.Q: When is the next Switch coming out? What kinds of features or new capabilities would you like to see?A: As we enter the seventh year for the Nintendo Switch, sales are still strong. I think we still have a very very strong lineup coming. As Mr. Furukawa (Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa) said recently, we’re entering uncharted territory with the platform. It’s exciting to see that demand is still there. So nothing to announce on any future console or device, but we are still feeling very bullish about Nintendo Switch.I should be careful about what I personally would like to see (in a new Switch). But what I can share is that one of the reasons that even going into year seven we feel very confident that the Switch can have a strong performance over the next few years is that it is still truly that unique device that you can play in a variety of ways, at home, on the go. One of the things we look at always is how can we surprise and delight. How can we introduce new unique ways of playing. That’s always in front of our mind.Q: Is Madden coming to the Switch?A: That’s a better question for my good friends over at EA.Q: Are supply chain problems still an issue?A: Really coming out of the summer and into the final quarter of last year, the holiday period, we saw that that constriction if you will in chip supply reduce. So right now, from a supply chain perspective, we’re able to supply that demand that’s out there.Q: How did you get to a $70 price figure for the upcoming Zelda game?A: We look at what the game has to offer. I think fans will find this is an incredibly full, deeply immersive experience. The price point reflects the type of experience that fans can expect when it comes to playing this particular game. This isn’t a price point that we’ll necessarily have on all our titles. It’s actually a fairly common pricing model either here or in Europe or other parts of the world, where the pricing may vary depending on the game itself.Q: Any sales goals for the new Zelda?A: There are, but they’re not publicly disclosed yet.Q: What’s the next big thing in gaming? The metaverse, AI, what else?A: I think what you’ll see with gaming is that we’ll continue to see new technologies come into play that will allow us to expand the number of players that come in. As we think about technology, the most important thing is we think about how will it improve the gameplay experienced. It’s not technology for technology’s sake. Will it really create this experience that is immersive, that creates smiles. We lead with that and then see what technology can support that.",2023/3/13,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833801,UK: Tens of thousands of doctors kick off 3-day strike,"LONDON (AP) — Tens of thousands of junior doctors went on strike across England on Monday to demand better pay, kicking off three days of widespread disruption at the U.K.'s state-funded hospitals and health clinics.Junior doctors — who are qualified but in the earlier years of their career — make up 45% of all doctors in the National Health Service. Their walkout means that operations and appointments will be canceled for thousands of patients, and senior doctors and other medics have had to be drafted in to cover for emergency services, critical care and maternity services.The British Medical Association, the doctors' trade union, says pay for junior doctors has fallen 26% in real terms since 2008, while workload and patient waiting lists are at record highs. The union says burnout and the U.K.'s cost-of-living crisis are driving scores of doctors away from the public health service.The union said newly qualified medics earn just 14.09 pounds ($17) an hour.“All that junior doctors are asking is to be paid a wage that matches our skill set,"" said Rebecca Lissman, 29, a trainee in obstetrics and gynaecology. “We love the NHS, and I don’t want to work in private practice, but I think we are seeing the erosion of public services.""“I want to be in work, looking after people, getting trained. I don’t want to be out here striking, but I feel that I have to,” she added.Other health workers, including nurses and paramedics, have also staged strikes in recent months to demand better pay and conditions. NHS figures show that more than 100,000 appointments have already been postponed this winter as a result of the nurses' walkouts.Stephen Powis, medical director of NHS England, said the 72-hour strike this week is expected to have the most serious impact and will cause “extensive disruption.”He said some cancer care will likely be affected, alongside routine appointments and some operations.Prime Minister Rishi Sunak told reporters on Sunday it was “disappointing that the junior doctors’ union are not engaging with the government."" The doctors' union said officials have refused to engage with their demands for months, and that a recent invitation to talks came with “unacceptable” preconditions.The doctors' strike this week will coincide with mass walkouts by tens of thousands of teachers and civil servants on Wednesday, the day the government unveils its latest budget statement.A wave of strikes has disrupted Britons’ lives for months, as workers demand pay raises to keep pace with soaring inflation, which stood at 10.1% in January. That was down from a November peak of 11.1%, but is still the highest in 40 years.Scores of others in the public sector, including train drivers, airport baggage handlers, border staff, driving examiners, bus drivers and postal workers have all walked off their jobs to demand higher pay.Unions say wages, especially in the public sector, have fallen in real terms over the past decade, and a cost-of-living crisis fueled by sharply rising food and energy prices has left many struggling to pay their bills.",2023/3/14,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833833,Tunisia's parliament convenes for first time since 2021,"TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) — Tunisia's new parliament convened Monday, the first time the country has had a functioning legislature since the president had the previous parliament sealed off by the army in 2021.The main opposition coalition declared it won't recognize the new parliament, whose members were chosen in December and January in elections boycotted by the president's opponents and ignored by the masses. Just 11% of voters cast ballots.During Monday's inaugural session, the lawmakers will elect a new speaker of parliament to succeed the leader of Islamist movement Ennahdha, Rached Ghannouchi, whose party had the largest number of members in the outgoing parliament.Unusually, only journalists from state broadcasters and the official state news agency were allowed inside the parliament for the opening session, and dozens of reporters protested outside. The session comes amid a growing crackdown on opposition Islamists and independent media and other dissenting voices, and on migrants from sub-Saharan Africa.President Kais Saied suspended the previous parliament in July 2021 in what he said was an effort to save the country. Saied and many Tunisians at the time blamed the Islamist legislators for the country's economic and social crises.Saied has since legislated by decree and moved to amass more and more power. That has raised concerns internationally, because Tunisia was the birthplace of the Arab Spring uprisings a decade ago and the only country to emerge with a new democratic system.The new legislature has less power than its predecessor, according to a new constitution that Saied pushed through in a referendum.It is meant to have 161 members, compared to 217 in the previous parliament. But only 154 candidates were elected in the two-round legislative ballot, because no candidates bothered to run in seven electoral districts representing Tunisians abroad, reflecting widespread disillusionment with the political class.Most political parties boycotted the elections, considering that the electoral process initiated by Saied was designed to establish his control over the country.The main opposition coalition, the National Salvation Front, said in a statement Sunday that it doesn't recognize the new parliament “resulting from an illegitimate constitution and elections that were boycotted by a large majority.""",2023/3/13,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833835,"Ex-Haiti mayor accused of killing, torture faces civil trial","BOSTON (AP) — Accusations of political violence and terror have followed a former Haitian mayor all the way to a Boston courtroom, where a civil trial began Monday that shines a light on the wider issue of bloodshed and unaccountability in the Caribbean nation's politics.Attorneys painted widely different pictures of Jean Morose Viliena during opening arguments in U.S. District Court in Boston. Those included claims of a killing, torture and arson — or a successful mayor who helped improve the town of Les Irois in the late 2000s.Viliena, who now lives in Massachusetts, is being sued by three Haitian citizens who say they or their relatives were persecuted by him and his political allies.The suit was filed under the Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991, which allows civil lawsuits to be filed in the U.S. against foreign officials who allegedly committed torture or extrajudicial killing — if all legal avenues in their home country have been exhausted. It was filed by the Center for Justice and Accountability in San Francisco.The defense said Viliena was not involved in violence and increased services while leading Les Irois, a town of around 22,000 people on Haiti's westernmost tip, about 140 miles (225 kilometers) from the capital Port-au-Prince.Viliena's attorney, Peter Haley told the 12-person jury during opening statements about a farmer's son who got an education, ran for mayor in 2006 and brought more paved roads, a medical clinic, waste pickup and a better education system — all lacking before his election.Viliena is a lawful permanent resident of the U.S., and he moved to the Boston suburb of Malden in 2009, drives a truck and is a “very productive member of the community,” Haley said.Bonnie Lau, an attorney for the plaintiffs, told the jury that Viliena violently suppressed and intimidated his political foes, even after he moved to the U.S.“This case is about murder, torture, arson and abuse of power,” Lau told the jurorsThe plaintiffs — David Boniface, Juders Ysemé, and Nissandère Martyr — lodged legal complaints against Viliena in Haiti, but he was ultimately released and never tried.Lau said they are bringing suit in the U.S. because they were failed by the corrupt Haitian justice system.It’s not the first time a former Haitian official has gone before an American court to answer for alleged wrongdoing in their homeland. In 2006, a New York judge ordered former Haitian strongman Emmanuel “Toto” Constant to pay $19 million in damages to three women who said they were gang-raped by paramilitary soldiers under his command.Viliena was elected as a candidate for the Haitian Democratic and Reform Movement and was backed by the Committee for Resistance in Grande-Anse, which according to the lawsuit dominates regional politics through patronage, threats and armed violence.Armed paramilitary groups that ally themselves with particular political parties and candidates and function above the law are commonplace in Haiti, said Robert Maguire, an adjunct professor at George Washington University and Haiti expert who testified on behalf of the plaintiffs.The paramilitary groups provide muscle for the politicians, he said, and in return get material rewards such as motorcycles, jobs, government posts and access to power.They act with impunity because of Haiti’s weak government and justice system.“When there’s no police or judiciary to keep you in check, you feel like you can act like you wish,” he said.Haley, the defense attorney, pushed back, asking Maguire if he was in Les Irois at the time of the alleged violence, and Maguire acknowledged he had never been to the town.The plaintiffs allege that in 2007 Viliena — a loyalist of former Haitian President Michel Martelly — began a “campaign of persecution” against Boniface, a supporter of the political opposition, after he tried to defend a neighbor who Viliena allegedly assaulted for piling garbage in the streetViliena allegedly led a group of men armed with guns, machetes and clubs to Boniface’s home. In Boniface's absence, his younger brother, Eclesiaste Boniface, was dragged out of the house and fatally shot by one of Viliena’s men, the lawsuit says.“They left his body on the street all night to send a message,” Lau said.The suit also alleges that Viliena and his men beat and shot Ysemé and Martyr at a community radio station in 2008. Ysemé was blinded in one eye, while Martyr lost a leg, according to the suit.Nissage Martyr has since died and his son has taken his place as a plaintiff.The plaintiffs also allege that Viliane's allies burned down dozens of homes occupied by his political opponents in 2009. Even though Viliena was not present during the arson, his allies acted on his orders, Lau said.The suit seeks unspecified damages.",2023/3/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833836,Dutch sports broadcaster editors quit over bullying report,"THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — The top editors at the Dutch national broadcaster's sports department have stepped down amid reports that there was a culture of inappropriate behavior and bullying among staff spanning more than two decades, the broadcaster said Monday.The move followed a report last week compiled by external experts who were asked to look into behavior at NOS Sport amid a wider investigation into the public broadcasting network following another high-profile case last year alleging workplace bullying at a flagship early evening talk show.“The inventory report contains reports of bullying, (sexual) intimidation, discrimination, verbal aggression and integrity issues over a period of more than 20 years,” NOS said in an initial reaction last week.At the time, the broadcaster said that the editorial leadership of the sports department would step down at an unspecified date in the future. But following reports in Dutch media over the weekend about the working conditions at NOS Sport, the four top editors said they would step down immediately.“Due to the discussions we have had over the past few days about the results of the inventory, the previously announced phased withdrawal has sped up,"" General director of NOS Gerard Timmer said in a statement Monday. ""We are now entering a phase in which we will look at what the sports department needs in the short term and in the future.”Dutch newspaper de Volkskrant reported in its weekend edition that it had spoken to 32 people, including current and former staffers at NOS Sport, and found a culture “in which women felt unsafe and where reports of (sexually) transgressive behavior were not taken seriously.”NOS Sport is the country's major sports broadcaster, covering major international events including the Olympics and the soccer World Cup.NPO, the umbrella organization for Dutch public broadcasters, said it supported the decision for NOS Sport leaders to step down.“There should be no room for transgressive behavior in public broadcasting,” NPO said in a statement. “It is vital that everyone feels supported not to accept and to correct inappropriate behavior in the workplace, but also that everyone feels safe enough to speak up about it.”The independent commission of inquiry was established last year following the reported bullying at De Wereld Draait Door — The World Keeps Turning — a popular talk show that ran for years on the public broadcast network. The commission is aiming to publish its final report by the summer.",2023/3/13,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833837,Vice President Harris to visit Africa in latest US outreach,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Vice President Kamala Harris will spend a week in Africa at the end of March as the United States deepens its outreach to the continent amid global competition, notably with China.“The trip will strengthen the United States’ partnerships throughout Africa and advance our shared efforts on security and economic prosperity,” said a statement from the vice president's spokesperson, Kirsten Allen.Harris' plans follow visits by first lady Jill Biden and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is going this week, and President Joe Biden is expected to travel to Africa later this year.However, Harris will be closely watched as the first Black vice president in U.S. history and the first woman to hold the position.She plans to be in Ghana from March 26 to 29, then in Tanzania from March 29 to 31. Her final stop is Zambia, on March 31 and April 1.Harris has a personal connection to the third country on her itinerary. Her maternal grandfather worked in Zambia years ago, and she visited him there as a young girl.Allen said the vice president's agenda will include promoting democracy, climate adaptation, women's economic empowerment and food security.Besides meeting the presidents of each of the three countries she's visiting, Harris plans to talk with “young leaders, business representatives, entrepreneurs, and members of the African Diaspora,” Allen said.The White House's concerted outreach to the continent began with the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit, which it hosted in December. China has invested heavily in Africa, but Washington is pitching itself as a better partner than Beijing.“Our administration will be guided not by what we can do for Africa but what we can do with Africa,” Harris said during the summit.Although competition between the U.S. and China has been the backdrop of much American foreign policy, the Democratic administration is trying to calibrate its approach to Africa so leaders on the continent don't feel as though they're being caught in the middle of a geopolitical contest.A senior administration official stressed that the White House wants to put forward an “affirmative agenda” that incorporates concerns about China and ripple effects from Russia's war in Ukraine but isn't dominated by them.",2023/3/13,,World

All three games are scheduled to be played in Sharjah on March 24, 26 and 27.For more than a year, Babar and Rizwan have represented Pakistan in almost all the games in the three formats while Fakhar, Rauf and Afridi have battled injuries.Chief selector Haroon Rasheed said that the selection committee wanted to enhance the pool of players with an eye on next year’s T20 World Cup in the West Indies and the United States.“This will help us to strengthen our pool of players as we look forward to building and preparing a formidable side for next year’s T20 World Cup,” Rasheed said.Saim Ayub, who scored 309 runs in 10 Pakistan Super League games and opened with Babar for Peshawar Zalmi, is among four uncapped players named in the 15-member squad.Fast bowler Ihsanullah, middle-order batter Tayyab Tahir and fast bowler Zaman Khan are the others who have impressed with their performances in the PSL.“The series against Afghanistan is the training ground to test our youngsters,” said Najam Sethi, chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board’s management committee. “I have talked to all the rested senior players and have told them that they will remain (an) integral part of the national team in future.”Sethi said Shadab was logical choice to lead Pakistan in the short series against Afghanistan because the all-rounder had been Pakistan’s vice-captain in white-ball cricket for the last couple of years.The PCB chairman said all five rested senior players will be recalled with Babar again taking up the captaincy for Pakistan’s home series against New Zealand in April.All-rounder Imad Wasim, who scored 404 runs in the PSL and also took nine wickets, returned to the national team after last playing in the T20 World Cup in the UAE in 2021.Wicketkeeper-batter Azam Khan, Abdullah Shafique and all-rounder Faheem Ashraf also made their comebacks as selectors dropped power-hitter Asif Ali, Haider Ali, Khushdil Shah and Mohammad Hasnain, who all were part of the team which competed at the T20 World Cup in Australia.___Squad: Shadab Khan (captain), Abdullah Shafique, Azam Khan, Faheem Ashraf, Iftikhar Ahmed, Ihsanullah, Imad Wasim, Mohammad Haris, Mohammad Nawaz, Mohammad Wasim, Naseem Shah, Saim Ayub, Shan Masood, Tayyab Tahir, Zaman Khan.___More AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/13,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833839,Taiwan says cross-strait tourism must be based on reciprocity,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) —Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Minister Chiu Tai-san (邱太三) said Monday (March 13) that cross-strait tourism must be based on the principle of reciprocity — noting that China prohibits its tourists from visiting Taiwan.KMT Legislator Lee De-wei (李德維) said Monday during an Internal Administration Committee meeting in the legislature that Taiwan's tourism and hotel operators are looking forward to Chinese tourists visiting and spending in Taiwan. He added that China does not forbid Taiwanese from traveling to China independently, CNA reported.Chiu explained that since Aug. 1, 2019, China has banned its people from visiting Taiwan for independent travel for political reasons and that Taiwan is not currently included in China’s list of oversea destinations that are open to Chinese tour groups. The opening up of cross-strait tourism must be reciprocal, Chu said, adding that Lee should instead ask China why it banned its people from traveling to Taiwan independently.Deputy Minister of Transportation and Communications Chi Wen-chung (祁文中) said the opening of tourism will benefit both sides of the strait, but it needs to be opened on a reciprocal basis. With China not allowing tour groups to go to Taiwan at this point, Taiwan, of course, will not allow its tour groups to visit China.Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Chuang Jui-hsiung (莊瑞雄) said that it was China that took the initiative to ban its tour groups and independent travelers from coming to Taiwan, per CNA.",2023/3/13,1357,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833843,Is DeSantis darkening Florida's sunny open-records laws?,"Florida has long been known for sunshine -- not only the warm rays that brighten its beaches but also the light of public scrutiny afforded by some of the nation's strongest meetings and records laws.Although years of rollbacks have gradually clouded the impact, advocates are ringing alarms that this year presents the greatest threat to transparency yet in the state that coined the name “Sunshine Law” for its open-government rules.Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, weighing a presidential bid, is pursuing a home-state agenda that could make it harder for people to learn what public officials are doing or to speak out against them. In an unprecedented move for the Sunshine State, DeSantis has claimed an executive right to keep key government records secret. He's also seeking to weaken a nearly 60-year-old national legal precedent protecting journalists and others who publish critical comments about public figures.Florida's Republican-led Legislature appears eager to carry out his vision. As their annual session began last week, lawmakers filed dozens of bills that would add to the state's lengthy list of open-government exceptions.“The state of sunshine is in peril,” warned Barbara Petersen, executive director of the Florida Center for Government Accountability, who has been tracking the state's public access laws for three decades.DeSantis, who is expected to launch a presidential bid following the session, has thrilled conservative activists nationwide by leaning into fights against the GOP's perceived political adversaries: public health officials, so-called “woke” leaders in business and public education — and the press.Former President Donald Trump, a potential rival and fellow Floridian, also is well-known for lambasting the press — describing the U.S. media as “the enemy of the people.” Such criticism often plays well within the modern-day Republican Party, where mainstream media are perceived to side with the interests of Democrats and liberals.But it runs contrary to Florida's historic reputation as a place where reporters — and curious members of the public — can unearth government data and documents that shed light on the decisions made by elected officials.Florida's law making government records open to public inspection dates to 1909, long before similar measures emerged in many other states. It added a Sunshine Law requiring public meetings in 1967. Then, in 1992, Florida voters approved a constitutional amendment guaranteeing a public right to access records and meetings. A decade later, as lawmakers were adding exemptions, voters approved another a constitutional amendment making it harder for legislators to approve future exceptions.Florida newspapers launched the first “Sunshine Sunday” in 2002 to highlight the importance of public access to government information. That one-day event has since grown to an annual Sunshine Week observed nationally by media and First Amendment advocates.As this year's Sunshine Week began Sunday, lawmakers in state capitols were pursuing a mixture of proposals — some excluding more government records from public inspection; others increasing the ability of people to keep an eye on their government. But nowhere, perhaps, have Sunshine Week issues garnered as much attention as in Florida — due largely to DeSantis' powerful platform to voice his complaints about the media.Last month, DeSantis hosted a livestreamed “panel discussion on defamation” while attempting to build support for his plan to make it easier to bring defamation lawsuits against the media or people who post things on the internet about public officials and employees.“You smear somebody, it’s false, and you didn’t do your homework, you’re going to have to be held accountable for that,” DeSantis said while concluding the event. “Hopefully, you’ll see more and more of that across the country.”DeSantis is seeking to undercut a 1964 U.S. Supreme Court decision that shielded news outlets from libel judgments unless proven that they were published with “actual malice” — knowing that something was false or acting with “reckless disregard” to whether it was true. Florida legislation to carry out DeSantis' plan would make it unnecessary to prove “actual malice” when the allegedly defamatory statements don’t relate to the reason why someone is a public figure.Other provisions of the legislation would presume anonymous statements in news stories are false for the purposes defamation lawsuits and would treat accusations of racial, sexual or gender discrimination as intrinsically defamatory.Petersen said such provisions appear to be a first nationally and could have a freezing effect on free speech.But Republican state Rep. Alex Andrade, who is sponsoring the bill, said it is ""a sincere attempt to try and fix the problems that exist in this type of law.”“This bill would make it easier for someone who’s actually been harmed by a defamatory statement to pursue justice in Florida courts,” Andrade said.The defamation legislation is just one of several DeSantis administration policies prompting concern among media organizations.Earlier this year, a Florida trial judge upheld DeSantis' assertion of “executive privilege” in refusing to turn over information requested under the state's public-records law about his screening of potential state Supreme Court nominees. That case is being watched by national media organizations as it's being appealed.The Florida Constitution contains no specific mention of “executive privilege."" Neither does the U.S. Constitution, though courts have upheld the president's prerogative to withhold documents to protect the confidentiality of advice received in the decision-making process. Governors in Oklahoma, Tennessee and Washington also have previously asserted the privilege.Another DeSantis administration policy has slowed access to some public records. Television station WKMG reported last month that public records requests to some state agencies were being routed for review to the governor's office, sometimes delaying their release by weeks or months.Public protests at the Capitol also have been limited. Under a DeSantis administration rule that took effect March 1, demonstrations at the Capitol Complex are only permitted outdoors. Requests to use space in the Capitol Complex must come from state agencies, the Legislature or judiciary, must be “consistent with the agency's official purpose” and cannot include displays with “gratuitous violence or gore” that are “patently offensive to prevailing standards in the community.”Florida's open-government reputation already was fading before DeSantis took office in 2019, but that trend has gained steam. In his first year, lawmakers expanded the list of personal details forbidden to be disclosed about various public officials. Last year, DeSantis signed a law shielding information about candidates for college and university presidencies.This year, roughly five-dozen bills already have been filed proposing more open-government exemptions, Petersen said. Some of those would prohibit the agency that provides security for DeSantis from disclosing the governor's travel arrangements — even after the fact.Though DeSantis said he doesn't support it, another bill filed this year would require bloggers to file periodic reports with the state if they are paid for posts about the governor, lieutenant governor, cabinet members or legislative officials.The cumulative effect is that “open government and public records laws are very much under the gun right now,” said Bobby Block, executive director of the First Amendment Foundation, a Florida nonprofit that advocates for the public’s right to open government.“Every year, we’re seeing the vast sweep of the original intention chiseled away – sometimes bit by bit, other times chuck by chuck,"" Block said, ""and it’s definitely not the way it used to be.”___Associated Press writers Anthony Izaguirre and Steve Peoples contributed to this report.",2023/3/13,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833845,Morocco coach backs Achraf Hakimi amid French investigation,"SALE, Morocco (AP) — Although implicated in a rape allegation in France, Achraf Hakimi was called into the Morocco squad Monday for friendly games against Brazil and Peru.Morocco coach Walid Regragui said the country supports the Paris Saint-Germain defender.“For us, and all Moroccans, we are behind Achraf,” Regragui said at a news conference to announce his first squad since the team’s historic run to the World Cup semifinals. “He has the presumption of innocence until it’s proven to the contrary.”Hakimi was given preliminary charges of rape on March 3 by prosecutors in the suburb of Nanterre. A 24-year-old woman said she was raped by Hakimi at his home, though his lawyer said it is part of a racketeering attempt.Hakimi has been allowed to leave France and played for PSG at Bayern Munich last week in the Champions League.Morocco will host Brazil in Tangier on March 25 and then play Peru in Madrid three days later.“I speak with Achraf often like I do lots of players,” Regragui said when asked Monday about Hakimi. “He’s calm, that’s most important. He’s someone who is strong on the pitch and beyond the pitch.“We have to think of football first,” the coach said. “He has people taking care of his business for him.”Morocco became the first African team to reach the World Cup semifinals last year. The team beat Belgium in the group stage and then Spain and Portugal in the knockout rounds. Morocco lost to France in the semifinals before being beaten by Croatia in the third-place game.Hakimi’s standout performances in Qatar earned him selection for the World XI team in a poll of players organized by global union FIFPRO.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/13,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833847,Frankfurt forgoes tickets for Napoli game over fan dispute,"FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — Eintracht Frankfurt is forgoing its allocation of tickets for Wednesday’s Champions League game at Napoli in protest over what it calls an “unlawful” decree from Italian officials limiting ticket sales to visiting supporters.The club is objecting to a decision by local authorities in Naples banning any fans who are residents of Frankfurt from buying tickets, following unrest between supporters during the first leg in Germany.“We do not wish to have anyone on site running the clear and obvious risk of an arbitrary administrative decision, the like of which we have been experiencing since the first leg in an unprecedented way on the part of all those responsible in Naples,” Frankfurt board member Philipp Reschke said late Sunday. “We will therefore be forgoing our entire away allocation, unless some aspect of the decree should change at short notice, contrary to expectations.”Frankfurt's appeal against the decree was rejected on Monday, the Bundesliga club said. It said it will also appeal that decision.""In view of the (lack of) time, this is now primarily about the principle and the future,” Reschke said.The dispute began last week when Italy’s interior ministry ordered Napoli not to sell tickets to any German fans because of security concerns following the trouble between supporters around the first leg in Frankfurt last month. Local police made several arrests amid altercations between fans.The Bundesliga club’s appeal to a local court against that decision was successful, but the prefecture of Naples reacted on Sunday with a ban on selling tickets to fans with addresses in Frankfurt.“The new decree is no less unlawful in its contents and its reasoning and furthermore is completely unsuitable, as it is a well known fact that two-thirds of our fans are from outside the Rhine-Main region and do not come from Frankfurt,” Reschke said.Napoli has a 2-0 lead from the first leg. ___ More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/14,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833849,"Biden OKs Alaska oil project, draws ire of environmentalists","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration said Monday it is approving a huge oil-drilling project on Alaska’s petroleum-rich North Slope, a major environmental decision by President Joe Biden that drew quick condemnation as flying in the face of his pledges to slow climate change.The announcement came a day after the administration, in a move in the other direction toward conservation, said it would bar or limit drilling in some other areas of Alaska and the Arctic Ocean.The approval of ConocoPhillips' big Willow drilling project by the Bureau of Land Management will allow three drill sites including up to 199 total wells. Two other drill sites proposed for the project will be denied. ConocoPhillips Chairman and CEO Ryan Lance called the order “the right decision for Alaska and our nation.”The Houston-based company will relinquish rights to about 68,000 acres of existing leases in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska.The order, one of the most significant of Interior Secretary Deb Haaland's tenure, was not signed by her but rather by her deputy, Tommy Beaudreau, who grew up in Alaska and briefed state lawmakers on the project Monday. Haaland was notably silent on the project, which she had opposed as a New Mexico congresswoman before becoming Interior secretary two years ago, until releasing a video Monday evening.She described Willow as “a difficult and complex issue that was inherited” from earlier administrations. Because ConocoPhillips has held leases in the area for decades, Haaland said officials ""had limited decision space” to block the project but focused on minimizing its footprint.Haaland defended the Biden administration's record on climate change, saying, “I am confident that we are on the right path, even if it’s not always a straight line.”Climate activists remained outraged that Biden approved the project, which they say puts his climate legacy at risk. Allowing the drilling plan to go forward marks a major breach of Biden’s campaign promise to stop new oil drilling on federal lands, they say.Monday's announcement is not likely to be the last word, with litigation expected from environmental groups.The Willow project could produce up to 180,000 barrels of oil a day, create up to 2,500 jobs during construction and 300 long-term jobs, and generate billions of dollars in royalties and tax revenues for the federal, state and local governments, the company said.The project, located in the federally designated National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, enjoys widespread political support in the state. Alaska’s bipartisan congressional delegation met with Biden and his advisers in early March to plead their case for the project, and Alaska Native state lawmakers recently met with Haaland to urge support.Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said Monday the decision was “very good news for the country.”“Not only will this mean jobs and revenue for Alaska, it will be resources that are needed for the country and for our friends and allies,” Murkowski said. “The administration listened to Alaska voices. They listened to the delegation as we pressed the case for energy security and national security.”Fellow Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan said conditions attached to the project should not reduce Willow's ability to produce up to 180,000 barrels of crude a day. But he said it was “infuriating” that Biden also had moved to prevent or limit oil drilling elsewhere in Alaska.Environmental activists who have promoted a #StopWillow campaign on social media were fuming at the approval, which they called a betrayal.“This decision greenlights 92% of proposed oil drilling (by ConocoPhllips) and hands over one the most fragile, intact ecosystems in the world to"" the oil giant, said Earthjustice President Abigail Dillen. ""This is not climate leadership.''Biden understands the existential threat of climate change, ""but he is approving a project that derails his own climate goals,'' said Dillen, whose group vowed legal action to block the project.John Leshy, who was a top Interior Department lawyer in the Clinton administration, said Biden’s climate goals aren’t the only factor in an environmental review process that agencies must follow.Leshy, a professor at the University of California College of the Law, San Francisco, called the decision on Willow defensible, adding: “I think it reflects a balancing of the things they have to balance, which is the environmental impact and the lease rights that Conoco has.''Christy Goldfuss, a former Obama White House official who now is a policy chief at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said she was “deeply disappointed'' at Biden's decision to approve Willow, which the BLM estimates would produce more than 239 million metric tons of greenhouse gases over the project’s 30-year life, roughly equal to the combined emissions from 1.7 million passenger cars.""This decision is bad for the climate, bad for the environment and bad for the Native Alaska communities who oppose this and feel their voices were not heard,'' Goldfuss said.The Willow project has been a particularly galvanizing issue for young activists, who flooded TikTok with videos opposing the proposal.Biden has not commented publicly on the project's approval. However, he talked about climate change with Kal Penn, an actor who served in the White House under President Barack Obama, in an interview that was taped last week and will be aired Monday evening on Comedy Central's “The Daily Show.""“We're going faster than anyone has ever gone,” Biden said when asked about young people who want him to push harder. He said the energy situation “got really complicated” with the Russian invasion of Ukraine, adding that “we're going to need fossil fuel.”“So it’s a matter of transitioning, but it’s not like you can cut everything off immediately,” Biden said.Anticipating anger among environmental groups, the White House announced Sunday that Biden will prevent or limit oil drilling in 16 million acres in Alaska and the Arctic Ocean. The plan would bar drilling in nearly 3 million acres of the Beaufort Sea — closing it off from oil exploration — and limit drilling in more than 13 million acres in the National Petroleum Reserve.The withdrawal of the offshore area ensures that important habitat for whales, seals, polar bears and other wildlife “will be protected in perpetuity from extractive development,″ the White House said in a statement.The conservation announcement did little to mollify activists.“It’s a performative action to make the Willow project not look as bad,"" said Elise Joshi, the acting executive director of Gen-Z for Change, an advocacy organization.City of Nuiqsut Mayor Rosemary Ahtuangaruak, whose community of about 525 people is closest to the proposed development, has been outspoken in her opposition, worried about impacts to caribou and her residents’ subsistence lifestyles. ""My constituents and community will bear the burden of this project with our health and our livelihoods,'' she said.But there is “majority consensus” in the North Slope region supporting the project, said Nagruk Harcharek, president of the group Voice of the Arctic Iñupiat, whose members include leaders from across much of that region.The conservation actions announced Sunday block drilling in the Beaufort Sea and build on President Barack Obama’s actions to restrict drilling there and in the Chukchi Sea.Separately, the administration moved to protect more than 13 million acres within the petroleum reserve, a 23-million acre chunk of land on Alaska’s North Slope set aside a century ago for future oil production. Areas to be protected include the Teshekpuk Lake, Utukok Uplands, Colville River, Kasegaluk Lagoon and Peard Bay Special Areas, which serve as habitat for grizzly and polar bears, caribou and migratory birds.___Associated Press writers Becky Bohrer in Juneau, Alaska and Matthew Brown in Billings, Montana, contributed to this story.",2023/3/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833850,"Pakistan's ex-PM Khan leads rally, ignores arrest warrants","ISLAMABAD (AP) — Former Prime Minister Imran Khan rallied thousands of supporters in eastern Pakistan on Monday as courts in the capital, Islamabad, issued two more arrest warrants for him over his failure to appear before judges in graft and terrorism cases, officials said.Since his ouster last April in a no-confidence vote in Parliament, Khan has routinely ignored arrest warrants and court summons in a string of cases against him, claiming they are a plot by the government of his successor, Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif, to discredit his campaign.The former cricket star turned Islamist politician has claimed that his ouster was illegal and a conspiracy by Sharif and Washington, which have denied the allegations.Khan's critics say his flaunting of the courts is a maneuver to delay his trials on allegations of terrorism, contempt of court and graft.One of the warrants issued Monday was over charges that Khan sold state gifts and concealed assets while in office; the other in connection with his verbal threats against a judge during a rally last year.The warrants request that Khan be brought to court for hearings scheduled on March 18 and March 29. However, it remained unclear whether police would act on them.The developments indicate Sharif's government is stepping up pressure on Khan, who is currently campaigning for his party in upcoming elections for two regional assemblies. Monday's rally was taking place in the eastern city of Lahore, where Khan now lives.“Imran Khan is deliberately failing to appear before the courts,” said Mohsin Ranjha, a lawyer for Sharif's ruling Pakistan Muslim League party.Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf opposition party said authorities have registered 80 “fake cases” against Khan in order to politically victimize the former premier, whose life is being threatened. Fawad Chaudhry, a senior party leader, said Khan's legal team would challenge the warrants.Khan's supporters threw rose petals at a convoy carrying him to the Lahore rally, which swelled to more than 5,000. Security was ramped up and hundreds of police were deployed to the city for Monday's rally, which authorities permitted.Last Wednesday, police used water cannons and fired tear gas to disperse Khan's supporters during a banned rally in Lahore. Dozens of his followers were arrested for defying the ban.Khan was attacked during a rally in November when a gunman shot him in the leg. One of Khan’s supporters was killed and a dozen others were wounded in the attack, which drew nationwide condemnation.",2023/3/14,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833864,RETRANSMISSION: Ballard Power Test Drives First Hydrogen LCVs,"Vancouver, British Columbia -  Newsfile Corp. - March 13, 2023 - First Hydrogen Corp. (TSXV: FHYD) (OTC Pink: FHYDF) (FSE: FIT) (""FIRST HYDROGEN"" or the ""Company"") welcomed Ballard Power Systems (""Ballard"") to test drive its first-generation zero emission light commercial vehicle (""LCV"") at AVL Powertrain's engineering facility in Basildon, UK. Ballard partnered with First Hydrogen to develop these first-of-their-kind hydrogen powered LCVs. The two Generation I vehicles use a combination of Ballard's latest LCS fuel cell stack and First Hydrogen's proprietary technology.   The First Hydrogen vehicles will be deployed with major fleet operators that have already enrolled to drive the hydrogen zero-emission LCV's. One of the UK's largest fleet operators will start the test drive process imminently. A total of 15 major fleet operators have registered to participate as part of the UK Aggregated Hydrogen Freight Consortium (""AHFC""). The trials give commercial operators from a range of sectors - including grocery, express delivery, utilities, and roadside assistance - the opportunity to test hydrogen-powered-fuel-cell electric vehicles alongside their existing fleets and compare different technologies.   The Generation I vehicles act as proof of concept and enable fleet operators, refuelling services and prospective customers to test fuel cell vehicles in real-world conditions. The LCVs are currently undergoing vehicle evaluation and mileage accumulation, which will support optimised vehicle efficiency. The data collected enables First Hydrogen to accurately calculate fuel consumption and vehicle range under different driving conditions and inform future vehicle development.   Importantly, the findings enable the Company to provide total cost of ownership (""TCO"") data to prospective customers. Ballard's LCS fuel cell stack technology was chosen for its maximum performance and lifetime durability, which helps to further optimise TCO and make the transition to zero emission vehicles financially competitive. To support the move to net zero, First Hydrogen is also developing an end-to-end 'Hydrogen-as-a-Service' solution, providing fleets with green hydrogen fuel, fleet aftercare and zero emission vehicles.   The global LCV market is projected to reach USD 751.86 billion by 2030, increasing at a compound annual growth rate of 5.1% during the forecast period (2022-2030). To meet the market's need to achieve emissions targets and to capitalise on improving zero emission infrastructure, First Hydrogen is leading the change in the LCV sector with functional, clean fleet solutions.   David Mucciacciaro, CCO at Ballard Power Systems, commented: ""We were pleased to experience First Hydrogen's LCV first-hand and delighted to see how our leading fuel cell technology performs on the road in a light-duty application. Our plans to expand Ballard's fuel cell production will enable the scale-up of the fuel cell market as we see continued investment and customer interest.""   Robert Campbell, CEO of First Hydrogen Energy, added: ""Our close working relationship with Ballard has played a key role in developing First Hydrogen's first generation of zero-emission LCVs. This was Ballard's first visit to see the vans and we were keen for their team to see the vehicles in action before they enter our key fleet trial programme in the coming weeks.""

(AP) — The search for the man suspected of killing one small-town Missouri police officer and badly injuring another ended Monday after police fired tear gas into the home, and arrested the man when he came outside.The shooting happened about 9:30 p.m. Sunday at a convenience store in Hermann, a town of 2,100 residents about 80 miles (130 kilometers) west of St. Louis. Detective Sgt. Mason Griffith of the Hermann Police Department died, and Officer Adam Sullentrup, 31, was hospitalized in stable condition, authorities said.The Missouri State Highway Patrol said the shooting happened after the officers went into the convenience store to arrest 35-year-old Kenneth Lee Simpson of St. Louis County on multiple outstanding warrants. Missouri Highway Patrol Sgt. Mike Mitchell said the officers were shot in an altercation inside the store. Authorities wouldn't say if either officer returned fire.Simpson left the store, and authorities weren't initially sure where he went. By early Monday, police surrounded a home along Highway 19 not far from the shooting site. TV video at midday showed a police robot being used to pull off the front screen door, then a drone was sent in.The patrol confirmed Monday afternoon that Simpson was taken into custody after a police tactical team fired tear gas into a house, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported.Robert Koerber, who was Hermann’s mayor when Griffith was hired seven years ago, told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that Griffith was a natural as a police officer, someone people trusted.“He was one of my favorite officers because he had such an easy and effective style,” Koerber said. “He seemed to take a personal interest in people. He was interested in whatever your problem was.”Online Missouri court records show Simpson has a long history of criminal charges involving drugs, weapons offenses, assault and property damage. A St. Louis County judge issued a warrant for Simpson's arrest in August when he failed to show up in court in a drug possession case.Hermann is town known for its annual German festivals is the county seat of Gasconade County. The local school district canceled classes Monday as a precaution.___This story has been corrected to show that Hermann is about 80 miles west of St. Louis, not 40 miles.

He's scheduled for a Tuesday detention hearing.Court records state that Mathur “knowingly transmitted in interstate and foreign commerce communications containing threats to injure other persons.”Mathur, a former graduate student in the Department of Anthropology, is charged with interstate or foreign threat to injure after authorities say he emailed threats from outside the U.S. to nine Wisconsin residents, court records show. He made an initial appearance in federal court in Detroit Saturday.Weeks ago, a man fatally shot three students and wounded five others on the Michigan State University campus.Mathur is accused of threatening nine people, most of them graduate students, staff or professors at the Madison campus. Among those emails were one to an anthropology professor saying that two of the other people he had threatened should “sue me right away,"" authorities said.“Otherwise, I will murder their children. Call the police and a lawyer, otherwise, I will kill their children and hide their flesh inside of their burger meat,” he added in the email, court records show.Authorities have accused him of sending another email to an assistant professor with the Wisconsin college's anthropology department with the subject line, “We are going to kill your daughters.” That person told officials that ""he found the email disturbing and he was scared for his family’s safety,"" according to court records.An anthropology professor told authorities that Mathur sent her an email in late February with the subject line, “We’re going to kill your family,” leaving her frightened and worried about her family’s safety, according to court records.Federal prosecutors charged Mathur in U.S. District Court’s Western Division of Wisconsin. The Detroit News reported that Mathur's court-appointed attorney is Amanda Bashi. She did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.",2023/3/13,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833873,"Yeoh, Fraser feel the love at Vanity Fair post-Oscars party","BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) — Michelle Yeoh and Angela Bassett locked in a long embrace, whispering and laughing with glee as nearly every phone in the vicinity came out to take photos.Vanity Fair's annual post- Oscars party was full of such moments of warmth and joy as Sunday night led into Monday morning after a drama-free Academy Awards, with none of the head-shaking heaviness that hung over last year's post-slap edition.Yeoh, whose best actress Oscar was one of seven on a dominant night for “ Everything Everywhere All at Once,” had just walked into the party and was swarmed by well-wishers and selfie-seekers before seeing Bassett, who hadn't looked happy when she lost best supporting actress to Yeoh's castmate Jamie Lee Curtis but was all smiles here.Yeoh later grasped her Oscar as she rocked back and forth to the Human League's “Don't You Want Me” at the edge of the dance floor, though it was hard to do much dancing with all the attention she was getting.Brendan Fraser got the same treatment when he walked in holding his best actor Oscar for “The Whale” shortly before Yeoh, making his way very slowly across the room amid constant congratulations.Half of the directing duo behind “Everything Everywhere All at Once,"" Daniel Scheinert, with none of the three Oscars he won Sunday night nor his partner Daniel Kwan in sight, stood outside and ate an In-N-Out burger, the party's traditional meal, as he bopped up and down to House of Pain's “Jump Around.”“Finally getting some dinner,"" Scheinert said as a long night, and an even longer awards season, neared its end. ""This is nice.”The champagne-soaked affair, which begins as a viewing party for 100 people and grows into the night’s most sought-after invitation, is thrown in a space that connects the Wallis Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts with Beverly Hills City Hall and is hosted by Vanity Fair editor Radhika Jones.It's always also full of far-less-famous folks holding Oscars, winners in categories including best documentary short, who get an automatic invite with their statuette.Oscar night is just beginning for many stars once the ceremony itself ends, and the first stop is always the Governors Ball, just an escalator ride up from the Dolby Theatre in the Ovation Hollywood complex.Winners go with one main objective: getting their Oscars engraved with their names, which this year was in plain sight of the party. Others take the chance to get a bite to eat of the Wolfgang Puck-prepared bites. Harrison Ford even made a quick loop around the room.Here, too, the mood couldn’t have been more different from the year prior, when the slap cast a pallor on the celebration. This time around, the winners could simply focus on their own moment.“ Navalny ” director Daniel Roher took his newly personalized best documentary feature Oscar with him to wait in line for prime rib. Sarah Polley followed, bounding her way up the stairs with her adapted screenplay Oscar in hand.It was relatively calm until Curtis made her way to the platform and photographers clamored to snap pictures.When Ke Huy Quan finally appeared to get his best supporting actor statuette personalized, he hammed it up for the cameras, pumping his fist and pointing toward the word “Oscars” emblazoned on the screen above him.“The Whale” playwright and screenwriter Samuel D. Hunter was still processing the fact that Fraser not only won, but name-checked him in his acceptance speech.“We set our expectations low, so it was incredible,” Hunter said. His husband standing at his side added, “He was totally crying.”Oscars host Jimmy Kimmel meanwhile was waylaid outside of the main party, chatting with “Top Gun: Maverick” director Joseph Kosinski and “The Whale” director Darren Aronofsky. Judd Hirsch also made his way to Kimmel, who was in good spirits standing next to his wife and producer, Molly McNearney, as he sipped red wine.“I thought it was a good show,"" screenwriter Tony Kushner said on his way out. ""I thought Jimmy Kimmel did great.”Brian Tyree Henry snapped a photo with Troy Kotsur, who won a best supporting actor award for his role in “CODA” at last year's Oscars, on his way out the door, leaving Kotsur free a few moments later to run after Michelle Williams. When she stopped and turned around, Kotsur complimented Williams on bringing such authenticity to her role in “The Fabelmans.”“Thank you so much,” she said. “That’s exactly what we wanted to do.”By 9:30, some were ready to go. Hugh Grant pointed to the exit and, separately, Sigourney Weaver wasn’t far behind. Vanity Fair was underway already, after all, and a drive away. Grant would be sipping champagne there soon after. Weaver, Kimmel and Hirsch soon followed.“The Fabelmans” director and Hollywood royalty Steven Spielberg made a rare, and brief, party appearance. He was greeted and embraced by Ariana DeBose, who won an Oscar last year for his “West Side Story.”The fame, and fortune, of the Vanity Fair party goes well beyond Hollywood.Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and partner Lauren Sanchez traded hugs, posed for photos and suggested travel plans with Denver Broncos quarterback Russell Wilson and wife Ciara.Tennis great John McEnroe, his wife, singer Patty Smyth, and actor and screenwriter Mindy Kaling chatted and stood for their own photos across the room.Outside on the smoky patio, Andrew Garfield and Seth Rogen shouted to each other over the pumping music from the nearby dance floor, and Rogen let loose his unmistakable laugh. Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai strolled up to say hi soon after.Yeoh and Fraser, best actress and best actor, ran into each other in the valet area outside the party and had one last warm hug at the end of a triumphant awards season for both that had the happiest of endings.Both were still getting constant kudos and requests for photos as they climbed into their cars and were whisked away.___AP Film Writer Lindsey Bahr reported from Los Angeles.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833874,Report: Ukraine world's 3rd biggest arms importer in 2022,"HELSINKI (AP) — Russia’s invasion of Ukraine that has led to a substantial flow of military aid to Kyiv from the United States and Europe made Ukraine the world’s third largest importer of arms in 2022, a Swedish think tank said Monday.The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, or SIPRI, reported that from 1991, when Ukraine became independent amid the fall of the Soviet Union, until the end of 2021, Ukraine imported few major arms.But Moscow’s invasion on Feb. 24 last year markedly changed that. Only Qatar — which has dramatically ramped up its arms purchasing in the past decade — and India imported more arms in the year, SIPRI said in its report on global arms transfers.Pieter Wezeman, senior researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Program noted that even as arms transfers declined globally last year, “those to Europe have risen sharply due to the tensions between Russia and most other European states.” He said that following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, European states want to import more arms, “faster.”SIPRI said that the export of arms has long been dominated by the United States and Russia with the two countries being the largest and second-largest arms exporters for the past three decades.However, the gap between the two has been widening significantly, while that between Russia and the third largest arms supplier, France, has narrowed. The think tank said it was likely that the invasion of Ukraine will further limit Russia’s arms exports due to Moscow’s need to prioritize supplying its own armed forces and low demand from other states due to trade sanctions.SIPRI’s data showed that U.S. arms exports increased by 14% between the periods 2013–17 and 2018–22, and Washington accounted for 40% of global arms exports in 2018–22.Meanwhile, Russia’s arms exports fell by 31% between the two periods, and its share of global arms exports decreased from 22% to 16%, while France’s share increased from 7.1% to 11%.SIPRI, established in 1966, is an independent international institute dedicated to research into conflict, armaments, arms control and disarmament.",2023/3/13,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833875,"Death toll climbs as Cyclone Freddy slams Malawi, Mozambique","BLANTYRE, Malawi (AP) — An unrelenting Cyclone Freddy that is currently battering southern Africa has killed at least 56 people in Malawi and Mozambique since it struck the continent for a second time on Saturday night, authorities in both countries have confirmed.Local police said 51 people in Malawi, including 36 in Chilobwe in the financial hub of Blantyre in the center of the country have died, with several others missing or injured. Authorities in Mozambique reported that five people were killed in the country since Saturday.The deaths in Malawi include five members of a single family who died in Blantyre’s Ndirande township after Freddy’s destructive winds and heavy rains demolished their house, according to a police report. A three-year-old child who was ""trapped in the debris"" is also among the victims, with her parents among those reported missing, authorities also said.“We suspect that this figure will rise as we are trying to compile one national report from our southwest, southeast and eastern police offices which cover the affected areas,” Malawi police spokesperson Peter Kalaya told the AP.The cyclone lashed over Mozambique and Malawi over the weekend and into Monday. It’s the second time the record-breaking cyclone — which has been causing destruction in southern Africa since late February — made landfall in mainland Africa. It also pummeled the island states of Madagascar and Réunion as it traversed across the ocean.The cyclone has intensified a record seven times and has the highest-ever recorded accumulated cyclone energy, or ACE, which is a measurement of how much energy a cyclone has released over time. Freddy recorded more energy over its lifetime than an entire typical U.S. hurricane season.Freddy first developed near Australia in early February and traveled across the entire southern Indian Ocean. It's set to be the longest-ever recorded tropical cyclone. The U.N.'s weather agency has convened an expert panel to determine whether it has broken the record set by Hurricane John in 1994 of 31 days.Freddy made landfall in the seaport of Quelimane in Mozambique on Saturday where there are reports of damage to houses and farmlands, although the extent of the destruction is not yet clear. Telecommunications and other essential infrastructure are still cut off in much of the affected Zambezia province, impeding rescue and other humanitarian efforts.French weather agency Météo-France's regional tropical cyclone monitoring center in Réunion warned Monday that “the heaviest rains will continue over the next 48 hours” as Freddy barrels on. Mozambique’s central provinces and Malawi have been identified as especially vulnerable to “floods and landslides in mountainous areas” by weather monitors.Much of the damage experienced in Malawi is in homes built in areas prohibited by law such as in mountainous regions or near rivers where they are battling landslides, unprecedented flooding and rivers bursting their banks. The cyclone has forced the Malawian government to suspend schools in 10 districts in its southern region “as a precautionary measure.”Freddy is expected weaken and to exit back to sea on Wednesday, according to Météo-France.___Alexandre Nhampossa and Tom Gould contributed to this report from Maputo, Mozambique.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833878,Calm after quake: Greek PM says tension with Turkey easing,"Greece’s prime minister Monday said a massive earthquake in Turkey and deadly rail disaster in northern Greece have helped de-escalate tension between the two neighbors, driven by a popular feeling of solidarity.The devastating Feb. 6 quake in southern Turkey killed some 50,000 people in the country and neighboring Syria. It was followed three weeks later by a head-on rail collision in Greece which left 57 dead and has halted train services so far this month.“After a long period of unacceptable provocations, a long period of aggressive behavior, today we are experiencing ... a de-escalation and a more positive attitude and behavior,” Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said.NATO members Greece and Turkey both face national elections before the summer, leading many allies to warn of a further escalation over long-standing disputes that include sea boundaries and drilling rights in the eastern Mediterranean.But an outpouring of sympathy in Greece for the victims of the earthquake and the response in Turkey has shifted the focus between the two neighbors, Mitsotakis said.“The deadly earthquake brought our two peoples closer together on a human level,” he said.Mitsotakis made the remarks after talks in Athens with Cyprus’ new President Nikos Christodoulides, who has sought to re-start talks in the war-divided island, split between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots in the breakaway north.Turkey will hold parliamentary and presidential elections on May 14, while Greece will hold parliamentary elections before July.",2023/3/13,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833885,U.S. routs Canada in WBC; Puerto Rico pitchers perfect,"PHOENIX (AP) — Mike Trout hit a three-run homer, Lance Lynn threw five impressive innings and the United States used a nine-run first to cruise past Canada 12-1 on Monday night in the World Baseball Classic.The game was called after seven innings because of the tournament's 10-run mercy rule.In Miami, José De León and three relievers combined on a perfect pitching performance as Puerto Rico routed Israel 10-0 in a matchup called after eight innings because of the mercy rule.Yacksel Ríos, Edwin Díaz and Duane Underwood Jr. closed out the win for Puerto Rico, which did not permit a baserunner. But it will not count as a perfect game in official WBC records because the game didn’t go a full nine innings.That’s the standard established by the Elias Sports Bureau, the official statistician for Major League Baseball.The U.S. improved to 2-1 and bounced back from an 11-5 loss to Mexico on Sunday with its best offensive performance of the tournament. Canada fell to 1-1 before a crowd of 29,621 at Chase Field.The Americans sent 12 batters to the plate in the first inning. Nolan Arenado had a two-run double to start the scoring and Trout finished it by belting a low fastball into the left-center seats.Lynn got the win, giving up one run and two hits while saving the bullpen for the team's final game of pool play against Colombia on Wednesday. United States manager Mark DeRosa had to use eight pitchers on Sunday in the loss to Mexico.Canada scored its lone run on Jared Young's homer. Left-hander Mitch Bratt took the loss, giving up six earned runs while getting only one out.PUERTO RICO 10, ISRAEL 0, 8 INNINGSMIAMI (AP) — Puerto Rico bounced back from a 9-6 loss to Venezuela the previous day with a dominant display.De León tied a WBC record with 10 strikeouts in 5 2/3 innings, earning the win. The right-hander was lifted after he fanned Spencer Horwitz on his 64th pitch, one under the tournament limit for starting pitchers in the first round. He exited to a huge ovation from the prohibitive Puerto Rico crowd of 27,813.Afterward, he got the game ball and had it signed by his teammates.Ríos relieved De León and struck out his only batter to end the sixth.With his team up 9-0 in the seventh, Molina turned to Díaz, the New York Mets’ star closer, and he fanned one hitter in a 1-2-3 inning. Underwood retired Israel in order on 10 pitches in the eighth.Javier Báez doubled twice and Francisco Lindor tripled and singled for Puerto Rico, which finished with 11 hits and improved to 2-1.Puerto Rico struck quickly against Israel starter Colton Gordon with a three-run first. Báez hit a two-run double and scored on Eddie Rosario’s double.Kiké Hernández made it 5-0 with a two-run double in the second and raced home on Emmanuel Rivera’s triple.Lindor’s two-run triple keyed a three-run fifth, and Hernández’s run-scoring single in the eighth ended the game.SOUTH KOREA 22, CHINA 2TOKYO (AP) — Kunwoo Park and Ha-Seong Kim hit grand slams in consecutive innings, and South Korea set a World Baseball Classic scoring record with a 22-2 blowout of China in a game between teams that were already eliminated.South Korea broke the runs record that had stood since Japan beat China 18-2 in the first round of the initial WBC in 2006.In the earlier Group B game, Australia defeated the Czech Republic 8-3 and reached a quarterfinal against Cuba on Wednesday. Japan plays Italy the following day in the second quarterfinal.In Group D, the Dominican Republic beat Nicaragua 6-1.South Korea (2-2) finished third in Group B and failed to advance past the first round for the third straight WBC. The South Koreans finished third in the initial tournament in 2006 and were runner-up in 2009.China (0-4) has never advanced past the first round. The last-place finish in the group means it will have to go through qualifying to reach the 2026 tournament.The South Koreans took a 4-2 lead with a two-run second, then broke open the game with eight runs in the third, six in the fourth and four in the fifth. The game was stopped after five innings under the tournament’s mercy rule, which calls for games to end if a team leads by 15 runs after five innings or by 10 runs after seven.Park had five RBIs, San Diego Padres infielder Ha-Seong Kim had four, and Hyseong Kim and Jung Hoo Lee three each for South Korea, which outhit China 20-4. Park hit his slam in the fourth off Hailong Sun and Ha-Seong Kim hit his in the fifth against Changlong Su.Winning pitcher Hyeong Jun So entered to start the second inning and retired nine straight batters.Losing pitcher Alan Carter, a Los Angeles Angels minor leaguer, allowed four runs, four hits and two walks in 1 1/3 innings.BRITAIN 7, COLOMBIA 5PHOENIX (AP) — Jaden Rudd hit a go-ahead, two-run double in the fifth inning, Harry Ford added a solo homer and Britain won a WBC game for the first time.Graham Spraker got the win by pitching 2 2/3 innings of scoreless relief, and Ian Gibaut earned the save.

Britain improved to 1-2.DOMINICAN REPUBLIC 6, NICARAGUA 1MIAMI (AP) — San Diego Padres stars Juan Soto and Manny Machado homered, and the Dominican Republic picked up its first win of WBC pool play.Rafael Devers hit a two-out RBI double in the first against Nicaragua starter JC Ramirez, driving in Soto for a 1-0 lead. Eloy Jimenez’s single in the second scored Soto again and gave the Dominicans a 2-0 lead.Winning pitcher Cristian Javier allowed only two hits and struck out four in four innings.The Dominican Republic (1-1) doubled its lead in the fourth when Francisco Mejia singled off Fidencio Flores to score Willy Adames, then Julio Rodriguez singled to drive in Jeimer Candelario.Soto blasted a shot to right field off Junior Tellez to make it 5-0 in the fifth, and Machado tagged Tellez in the next inning with a drive to right-center.Soto scored three runs. Machado also doubled in the ninth.Nicaragua (0-3) made it 6-1 in the eighth on Elian Miranda’s bases-loaded RBI single. Ramirez took the loss.AUSTRALIA 8, CZECH REPUBLIC 3TOKYO (AP) — Milwaukee Brewers prospect Alex Hall had four RBIs as Australia (3-1) advanced past the first round for the first time in five WBC appearances, finishing second in the group behind Japan (4-0). The Czechs (1-3) finished fourth.Logan Wade hit a tiebreaking, two-run double off the right-field wall in the seventh off loser Marek Minarik, driving in Robbie Glendinning and Aaron Whitefield for a 3-1 lead.Hall homered in the first, the only hit off Martin Schneider in 5 1/3 innings.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833886,Netanyahu allies in Israel plow ahead on legal overhaul,"JERUSALEM (AP) — The Israeli parliament on Monday advanced a bill that would make it harder to oust Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the corruption charges against him, as it plowed ahead with a broader plan to overhaul the country’s legal system in defiance of mass protests.Lawmakers in the Knesset gave preliminary approval during a late-night vote on the bill, which would allow the parliament to declare a prime minister unfit to rule only for physical or mental reasons.The body was expected to vote later on a measure that would allow the Knesset to overrule Supreme Court rulings and enact laws that had been struck down. Both bills require additional votes before being enshrined into law.The steps were the latest in a series of moves by Netanyahu's coalition to overhaul Israel's legal system. The prime minister and his allies say the effort is aimed at reining in an activist court. Critics say the drive would upend the country's democratic checks and balances and concentrate power in the hands of Netanyahu and his parliamentary majority.Netanyahu and his ultranationalist and religious coalition allies have pledged to plow ahead with the legal changes despite demonstrations by tens of thousands of Israeli protesters over the past two months. Business leaders, legal experts and retired military leaders have joined the protests, and Israeli reservists have threatened to stop reporting for duty if the overhaul passes.In a late-night vote, the Knesset moved forward a bill that would protect Netanyahu from calls to oust him, replacing current law that opens the door for a leader to be removed under other circumstances. The new bill would require approval by three-quarters of the government, and could be overridden by the prime minister.The measure has personal importance to Netanyahu, who returned to power late last year after Israel’s fifth election in under four years. He is on trial on charges of fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes, and denies the allegations. The proceedings have dragged on for nearly three years.Good governance groups and other critics have called on the country’s attorney general to deem Netanyahu unfit for office.Speaking to members of his Likud party on Monday, Netanyahu lashed out at the Israeli media, saying they are broadcasting a “never ending tsunami of fake news” against him. He reiterated his claim that the legal overhaul will strengthen Israeli democracy.Opposition lawmaker Orna Barbivai said the bill was “a disgrace, which says the the prime minister is above the law.”Israel’s Palestinian minority, which makes up some 20% of the population, has been largely absent from the protests, in part because they suffer from discrimination in Israel and and because of Israel’s treatment of their Palestinian brethren in the West Bank and Gaza.",2023/3/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833887,Russia: 60-day extension of wartime grain deal acceptable,"GENEVA (AP) — A Russian delegation at talks with senior U.N. officials said Monday that Moscow is ready to accept an extension to a grain export deal that has helped bring down global food prices amid the war in Ukraine — but only for 60 days as the Kremlin holds out for changes to how the arrangement is working.The United Nations said it “notes” the Russian announcement and reaffirmed its support for the agreement struck in July as “part of the global response to the most severe cost-of-living crisis in a generation.”The U.N. and Turkey brokered the deal between the warring countries that allows Ukraine — one of the world’s key breadbaskets — to ship food and fertilizer from three of its Black Sea ports.The 120-day agreement was renewed last November. That extension expires on Saturday, and another 120-day extension was on the table.Ukraine charged that the Russian proposal to extend it only for 60 days goes against the deal, although the language of the agreement allows the parties to roll it over or ""modify” it — as Russia did Monday.The noncommittal U.N. response betrayed the world body’s inability to force hands. Russia can largely do what it wants to abide by or reject the deal, leaving the issue dangling for countries in the developing world, which benefit most.“The U.N. Secretary-General has confirmed that the U.N. will do everything possible to preserve the integrity of the Black Sea Grain Initiative and ensure its continuity,” a U.N. statement said. It stressed that the deal had allowed the export of 24 million tons of grain and more than 1,600 trips by vessels through the Black Sea — with more than half the exports destined for developing countries.In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price emphasized the need to extend the deal, describing it as a “critical instrument at a critical time.”Moscow has voiced frustration that a parallel agreement has failed to fully open the door to Russian exports of grain and fertilizer through the Black Sea. Still, overall Russian wheat shipments were at or near record highs in November, December and January, increasing 24% over the same three months a year earlier, according to financial data provider Refinitiv.“The comprehensive and frank conversation has once again confirmed that while the commercial export of Ukrainian products is carried out at a steady pace, bringing considerable profits to Kiev, restrictions on the Russian agricultural exporters are still in place,” the Russian delegation said in a statement.“The sanctions exemptions for food and fertilizers announced by Washington, Brussels and London are essentially inactive,” it claimed.U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said the organization has been working to facilitate Russian agricultural exports, noting that while Russian food and fertilizer haven’t been sanctioned, private companies have been cautious to deal with them and “that’s why we’ve asked for letters of comfort from certain governments.”As part of the arrangement, Moscow wants Russian ammonia to be fed through a pipeline across Ukraine to Black Sea ports for possible export. Russian officials also say banking restrictions and high insurance costs have hurt their hopes of exporting fertilizer.Ukraine’s Deputy Prime Minister Oleksandr Kubrakov claimed that ""Russia’s position to extend the deal only for 60 days contradicts the document” envisaging an extension of at least 120 days and said Kyiv was awaiting the official positions of the U.N. and Turkey.Rebeca Grynspan, secretary-general of the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development, and Martin Griffiths, head of the U.N. humanitarian agency, hosted a team led by Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Vershinin at U.N. offices in Geneva.Ukraine and Russia are key global suppliers of wheat, barley, sunflower oil and other food to countries in Africa, the Middle East and parts of Asia where millions don't have enough to eat. Russia was also the world’s top fertilizer exporter before the war.The loss of those supplies, after Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, drove global food prices higher and fueled concerns of a hunger crisis in poorer countries.The Black Sea Grain Initiative involves seaborne checks of cargo by U.N., Russian, Ukrainian and Turkish officials to ensure that only foodstuffs — not weapons — are being transported.The amount of grain leaving Ukraine has dropped even as the deal works to keep food flowing. Inspections of ships under the grain initiative have fallen sharply since they got rolling in earnest in September, and vessels have been backed up.Western critics accuse Russia of dragging its heels on inspections. Moscow denies that.Though the grain deal helped stabilize global food prices, there are still concerns about the impact on prices of possible trade restrictions and weather, especially heat waves, said Michael Puma, director of Columbia University’s Center for Climate Systems Research whose research focuses on global food security.“Big picture, we’re pretty fortunate that the weather conditions have allowed … high levels of production across many of the grains,” he said.On the front lines in Ukraine, the eastern city of Bakhmut remained the site of fierce fighting, with Ukrainian forces denying Russian forces the prize of its capture after six months of attrition.In a video address late Monday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted that “it's very tough in the east, very painful,” adding that “we need to destroy the enemy’s military might, and we will.”Ukraine's ground forces chief, Col. Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi also noted that “the situation around Bakhmut remains difficult,” with assault units from Russia's Wagner Group military contractor ”advancing from several directions, trying to break through the defenses of our troops and advance to the central districts of the city.”Ukraine’s presidential office said that four civilians were killed by the latest shelling, including two in the southern Mykolaiv region. Three more, including a 7-year-old child, were wounded.On Monday, one civilian was killed in Avdiivka in the Donetsk region, where a school building was destroyed, and five others were wounded by Russian shelling of the village of Kostiantynivka. Another person died in shelling of Znob-Novhorodske in the northern Sumy region that also wounded four people.Russian officials accused Ukrainian forces of shelling the town of Volnovakha in the Russia-controlled part of the Donetsk region that killed two civilians and wounded two others on Monday. ___Karl Ritter reported from Kyiv.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833888,Agents stop crowd at Texas border crossing amid asylum woes,"EL PASO, Texas (AP) — A large group of migrants in Mexico who were poised to barge into the U.S. over the weekend were blocked from crossing a bridge leading from Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, to El Paso, Texas, a U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesman said.The migrants were “posing a potential threat to make a mass entry,” and physical barriers were put up to restrict their entry at the Paso Del Norte International Bridge on Sunday afternoon, spokesman Roger Maier said in a statement to The Associated Press on Monday.Barricades also were used in El Paso for a short time Sunday afternoon at other border crossings including the Bridge of Americas and the Stanton-Lerdo bridge, Maier said.Video of the scene at the Paso Del Norte bridge on Sunday showed hundreds of migrants brush past Mexican National Guard officers on the Mexican side, some carrying children on their shoulders. Many appeared to be Venezuelan, by their accents.Shouting “We want to get through!,” the migrants ran up to the center line of the bridge, where U.S. authorities had erected concrete and plastic barriers strung with concertina wire.The migrants were stopped by the barrier, and remained on the Mexican side, shouting “Open up for us!” to the U.S. officers. After a time, the migrants ran back toward the Mexican side.Traffic was reopened and flowing in both directions as of Sunday evening, Maier said. It wasn’t immediately known what caused the attempted mass crossing. A message seeking comment was left with the mayor’s office in El Paso.The rush across the bridge may have been sparked by false rumors, said Camilo Cruz, who works with the U.N. migration office in Ciudad Juarez.Cruz said there was “a rumor that they were going to let them cross massively, particularly people who arrived with children.”Cruz said the rumors are a recurrent problem. About a month ago, messages began circulating “that there were going to be buses on the U.S. side to take them to Canada ... and when they arrived, they were told it was a lie.”The worst thing, Cruz said, is that migrants often leave the shelters where they are staying to attend such mass crossing attempts, only to find the shelters full when they return.Many of the migrants on Sunday appeared to be asylum seekers. One woman held out what appeared to be an appointment slip at the barricade. Migrants seeking asylum, a legal immigration pathway for people fleeing persecution in their own country, have been frustrated by newly-implemented limits on those showing up at the southwest border, as many Venezuelans do.There has been frustration with the U.S. government’s CBPOne mobile app for making appointments to apply for asylum, which has been overloaded since the Biden administration introduced it Jan. 12. New appointments are available each day at 6 a.m., but migrants find themselves stymied by error messages.Also causing frustration is a pandemic rule, scheduled to end May 11, that denies migrants a chance to seek asylum on grounds of preventing the spread of COVID-19. Under the public health rule, known as Title 42, Mexico recently began taking back Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans who crossed.In addition, the Biden administration has said it will generally deny asylum to migrants who show up at the U.S. southern border without first seeking protection in a country they passed through.",2023/3/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833889,"AP source: Browns restructure Watson deal, get D-line help","CLEVELAND (AP) — The Cleveland Browns shifted some of the money they owe Deshaun Watson and started spending it on players to help him — and their sketchy defense.The Browns restructured the quarterback's record-setting $230 million contract to create salary-cap space early Monday ahead of NFL free agency, a person familiar with the situation told The Associated Press.Then, coming off a disappointing 7-10 season, Cleveland began addressing needs by agreeing to three-year contracts with center Ethan Pocic and defensive end Ogbonnia Okoronkwo, said the person who has direct knowledge of the team's plans.Late Monday night, the Browns reached agreement with defensive tackle Dalvin Tomlinson on a four-year, $57 million contract after missing out on tackles Javon Hargrave and Dre’Mont Jones, who were targets but signed elsewhere.Tomlinson should improve Cleveland's shoddy run defense, which was a major problem in 2022 and led to coordinator Joe Woods being fired.Tomlinson spent the past two seasons with Minnesota after being drafted by the New York Giants in 2017. Primarily a run stopper, he had 42 tackles in 13 games and 2 1/2 sacks.As for Watson, the Browns always have had the ability to convert his base salary ($46 million in 2023) to a signing bonus and created $36 million of room, according to the person who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because the team is not publicly disclosing any information.Teams are permitted to reach agreements with free agents for two days before signings can become official starting Wednesday.The Browns began patching up a defensive line with numerous holes by agreeing with pass rushing end Okoronkwo on a three-year contract. Okoronkwo's deal is worth $19 million and includes $12.5 million guaranteed, according to NFL Network.Cleveland needed another end to pair with All-Pro Myles Garrett. Jadeveon Clowney filled that role the past two seasons, but the Browns have no desire to bring him back after a down season which ended with him criticizing the team and being sent home before the finale in Pittsburgh.The 6-foot-1, 253-pound Okoronkwo spent three seasons with the Los Angeles Rams before going to Houston. The 27-year-old had a career-best five sacks for the Texans last season.Another priority was re-signing center Ethan Pocic, and the Browns locked the 27-year-old up by agreeing to bring him back on a three-year deal,Pocic had a strong 2022 season with the Browns, who were in a bind at center after they released veteran JC Tretter and projected starter Nick Harris suffered a season-ending knee injury in the exhibition opener.Pocic stepped in and anchored Cleveland's solid line, which includes All-Pro left guard Joel Bitonio and steady right tackle Jack Conklin, who signed a four-year, $60 million extension in December.Watson's restructuring was expected because it was the easiest way for the Browns to clear space after being roughly $14 million over the salary cap. General manager Andrew Berry recently said the restructuring of Watson's deal was “on the table.”Berry had previously reworked kick returner Jakeem Grant Sr.’s contract and the Browns are releasing safety John Johnson III, who was entering the final season of a three-year, $33.75 million deal.A three-time Pro Bowler, Watson initially rejected a trade from Houston to Cleveland a year ago but changed his mind after the Browns offered him a five-year, $230 million contract that was fully guaranteed.The team was criticized for the deal given that Watson had been accused of sexual misconduct and harassment by 23 women in Texas. He has since settled 23 civil lawsuits brought by the women, who worked as massage therapists and said the QB acted inappropriately during therapy sessions.Watson was suspended 11 games last season by the NFL for violating its personal conduct policy. He played in six games for Cleveland, posting a 3-3 record while looking rusty following a nearly two-year layoff.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/3/14,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833891,Doubles star Bob Bryan succeeds Fish as US Davis Cup captain,"One of many highlights of Bob Bryan’s time as half of a record-breaking men’s doubles duo was helping the United States claim the 2007 Davis Cup — the last time the country won the competition. Now Bryan will try to end that drought from the sideline.The U.S. Tennis Association on Monday announced Bryan’s appointment as Davis Cup captain, succeeding Mardy Fish. Bryan’s first matches in charge will come during the group stage in September.Bryan and his twin brother, Mike, earned a record 16 Grand Slam championships together, 119 tour-level titles and an Olympic gold medal in doubles, finishing 10 seasons atop the ATP rankings before retiring in 2020. They went 25-5 as a pair in Davis Cup matches, including a win that clinched the U.S. victory over Russia 16 years ago in Portland.“That is at the top of the list of my best memories in tennis. All of those times in the Davis Cup trenches with my teammates are seared into my mind. We had highs and we had lows, but they’re definitely unforgettable,” Bob Bryan said in a telephone interview from Miami, where he lives. “We’ll never forget celebrating with our teammates, who we had gone through a lot with: Andy Roddick, James Blake, Mardy Fish. We had a fun night out in Portland. We were drinking out of the cup — whatever Roddick poured in there. He was the bartender for that night.”Told of Bryan's captaincy on Monday, Roddick said: “Bob knows Davis Cup. He's passionate about Davis Cup. He was one of the people that always said ‘yes’ to Davis Cup. The guys seem to like him a lot. I'm curious how he's going to put his brand, his stamp, on it.”Bryan, who also will have a role with the USTA’s player development program, takes over the Davis Cup squad during a recent surge by American men on tour. It’s been 20 years since Roddick won the U.S. Open for the last Grand Slam singles trophy by a man from the U.S., but Frances Tiafoe reached the semifinals at Flushing Meadows last September and Tommy Paul made it to the final four at the Australian Open in January.The week after the Australian Open, those two were among 10 men from the United States ranked in the top 50, the most since June 1995. When Taylor Fritz rose to No. 5 last month, it was the highest ranking for an American man since Roddick in 2009.“What I’m looking forward to is working with the guys throughout the year. Understanding them better. Getting to know them and their coaches. As a captain, you’ve got to understand that everyone is different and responds differently to different words. With coaching, sometimes it’s better not to say too much,” Bryan said. “I’m definitely going to be a good listener, but I want to bring my enthusiasm, passion and energy to this event and show the guys what an honor it is to represent the U.S. I think these guys are really motivated to win this thing.”The USTA said in January that Fish would no longer be captain, a post he held since 2019.Bryan was a Davis Cup coach under Fish and served as an acting captain last year when Fish was sidelined with COVID-19.The two were fined $10,000 apiece and put on a four-month probation by the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) in November for promoting a gambling operator via social media. The ITIA said Bryan and Fish cooperated fully with its investigation and removed the problematic posts immediately.“I’ve never done any sort of sports gambling and I broke a new ITIA rule. It was a little unclear what impact that would have on my chances to be captain, but now it’s in my rearview,” Bryan said. “I’m happy to have it behind me.”___AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/14,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833903,German department store chain to shut 40% of its outlets,"BERLIN (AP) — Germany's last major department store chain announced Monday that it plans to close two-fifths of its branches, months after it filed for insolvency protection for the second time in less than three years.The long-troubled Galeria Karstadt Kaufhof plans to shut 52 of its current 129 stores in two phases, with the first closing down at the end of June and the rest at the end of January.It said that about 4,000 employees at those stores will be affected, and that another 300 jobs will go at its headquarters in Essen and in other areas such as IT and facility management.The company said that, because of economic circumstances and “local conditions,” and after “intensive negotiations” with landlords and city authorities, there was no positive outlook for the stores that are to be axed.The remaining 77 stores will be modernized over the next three years with ranges that are more tailored to local needs, with 11,000 jobs being safeguarded, Galeria Karstadt Kaufhof said in a statement.The company, which resulted from the merger a few years ago of rivals Karstadt and Kaufhof, sought protection from creditors in late October, citing a steep rise in energy prices, high inflation and weak consumer spending.It had already shut around 40 stores and cut some 4,000 jobs after seeking protection during the first lockdown of the coronavirus pandemic in April 2020, and reportedly was granted 680 million euros ($724 million) in state aid.",2023/3/14,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833948,The meaning behind the blue ribbons worn at the Oscars,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Small and subtle, the blue ribbons worn by many celebrities at the Oscars nonetheless had an important message: support refugees.According to a statement from the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, donning the #WithRefugees ribbons Sunday ""sends a powerful visual message that everyone has the right to seek safety, whoever, wherever, whenever they are.”The ribbons were made by Knotty Tie Co., which the agency says provides employment, training and education to refugees resettled in the Denver area.“In many of the films nominated at festivals and awards ceremonies this season, the human themes of conflict, separation and loss are present,” the agency said in the statement, citing movies like “Avatar: The Way of Water” and “Marcel the Shell with Shoes On.”“Through effective storytelling, these films help erode discrimination and misunderstandings, offer new perspectives and help to build compassion for people forced to flee,” the statement continued.The number of displaced people globally now tops 103 million, a figure augmented by significant factors like Russia's war in Ukraine, other conflicts around the world and climate change.Best supporting actor Ke Huy Quan, born in Vietnam, referenced his own story of being a refugee during his acceptance speech.“My journey started on a boat. I spent a year in a refugee camp,” Quan said. “Somehow, I ended up here on Hollywood’s biggest stage. They say stories like this only happen in the movies. I cannot believe it’s happening to me. This — THIS — is the American dream.”Like other U.N. agencies, UNHCR has a long history of celebrity engagement — most famously, Angelina Jolie was the refugee agency's lone special envoy until parting ways last year.Best actress nominee Cate Blanchett is a goodwill ambassador for UNHCR. But on Friday, U.N. spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric put in a plug for a goodwill ambassador from a different agency — the U.N. Development Programme. When asked whether he had a favorite for best picture, he demurred.“No, but I do hope that the UNDP’s own goodwill ambassador Michelle Yeoh wins best actress, and we wish her all the best,” he said of the eventual winner.___For more Oscars coverage, visit https://apnews.com/hub/academy-awards",2023/3/13,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833949,UN inquiry commission: Quake aid was slow to reach Syria,"GENEVA (AP) — The international community and the Syrian government did not act quickly enough last month to help people in need in the rebel-held northwest after a deadly earthquake hit Turkey and conflict-ravaged Syria, a U.N.-backed commission said Monday.The Feb. 6 magnitude 7.8 earthquake and strong aftershocks that ravaged southern Turkey and northwestern Syria killed more than 50,000 people, including over 6,000 in Syria.The Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria said there should be an investigation into why it took a week to open border crossings for aid to flow. It added that war-torn Syria “now needs a comprehensive cease-fire that is fully respected” for civilians, including aid workers, to be safe.The commission also said there have been new attacks in Syria, including a reported Israeli airstrike last week on the international airport of the northern city of Aleppo putting it out of service for three days. The airport has been a main point for aid flowing into Syria and flights were diverted to two other airports when it was closed.The commission is made up of outside, independent experts who have been working under a mandate from the U.N.-backed Human Rights Council since nearly the start of the Syrian conflict in 2011.It took a week for the U.N. and the government of Syria’s President Bashar Assad to agree on opening two more border crossings into the rebel-held region bordering Turkey as many people were still under the rubble.“Since the earthquake, we have seen many acts to help victims by the Syrians themselves,” commission member Paulo Pinheiro said during a news conference in Geneva. He added that “we also witnessed a complete failure by the government and the international community including the United Nations to rapidly direct urgent lifesaving aid for northwest Syria.""“Many days were lost without any aid to survivors of the earthquake,” Pinheiro said. “Actors didn’t rapidly direct urgent lifesaving aid to northwest Syria which became the epicenter of neglect.”A week after the earthquake, the U.N. announced that Syrian President Bashir Assad agreed to open for three months two new crossing points from Turkey to the country’s rebel-held northwest to deliver desperately needed aid and equipment to help earthquake victims. Before that, the U.N. had only been allowed to deliver aid to the northwest Idlib area through a single crossing at Bab Al-Hawa, at Syrian ally Russia’s insistence.“They failed to deliver international emergency support including rescue teams and equipment in the vital first week after the earthquake,” Pinheiro said, adding that “Syrians, for good reasons, felt abandoned and neglected by those who (are) supposed to protect them in their most desperate time.”“Many voices are rightly calling ... for an investigation and accountability to understand how this failure, this disaster happened beyond the earthquake,” Pinheiro said.Commissioner Hanny Megally said “it’s a shame that all the actors really involved have not been helping in this area and it is difficult of course without proper investigation to say who's most responsible.”U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said the U.N. legal position is that it works under the mandate of the U.N. Security Council, which at the time of the quake only mandated aid deliveries to Syria’s northwest through the Bab Al-Hawa crossing.“The U.N. did everything in its power as quickly as possible to help all of the people in Syria,” Dujarric told reporters at U.N. headquarters in New York.The commission called on nations who have nationals held in the camps of al-Hol and Roj in northeast Syria to speed up the repatriation process. It said conditions are deteriorating at the camps that are housing some 56,000 mostly women and children linked to the Islamic State group.“The suffering inflicted on them may amount to the war crime of committing outrages on personal dignity. We call again for repatriations to speed up,” the commission's report said.At the fenced camp of al-Hol, there are some 50,000 Syrians and Iraqis crowded into tents. Nearly 20,000 of them are children; most of the rest are the wives and widows of IS fighters. In a separate, heavily guarded section of al-Hol known as the annex are an additional 2,000 women from 57 other countries — they are considered the most die-hard IS supporters — along with their children, numbering about 8,000.Some countries, including France, Spain, Russia and Iraq repatriated some of their citizens in recent months but many other countries still refuse.“Health care is very limited, education is very limited and some of those children have no life apart from these awful conditions,” said commissioner Lynn Welchman. “These camps are horrendous places.”___Mroue reported from Beirut.___Associated Press writer Edith M.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833950,Ke Huy Quan gets Oscar congrats from 'Goonies' co-stars,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Ke Huy Quan says his fellow “Goonies” readily congratulated him on his Oscar win for best supporting actor.The “Everything Everywhere All at Once” star, who played Data in the iconic 1985 adventure film, told reporters Sunday that he heard from every single co-star including Josh Brolin, Corey Feldman and Martha Plimpton.“I love all of them so much. Every single one of them was so happy ... We're family forever. Goonies never say die,” said Quan, pumping his fists while uttering the movie's signature line.Another connection to “The Goonies” that Quan brought in was his attorney. Jeff Cohen, who played Chunk in the film, represented him during his contract negotiations for “Everything Everywhere All at Once.”Cohen was in the audience and got a shout-out from Quan during his acceptance speech.“Everything Everywhere All at Once” had a big night, garnering seven Oscars including best picture, best director, best lead actress for Michelle Yeoh and best supporting actress for Jamie Lee Curtis.___For more coverage of this year’s Academy Awards, visit: https://apnews.com/hub/academy-awards",2023/3/13,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833951,Mikaela Shiffrin brings aboard Karin Harjo as head coach,"PARK CITY, Utah (AP) — Fresh off breaking the record for most World Cup race wins, Mikaela Shiffrin has a new head coach, Karin Harjo, who has been leading Canada’s Alpine skiing team.U.S. Ski & Snowboard announced Harjo’s hiring on Monday and said she will join Shiffrin in April. Harjo has worked with Shiffrin as an assistant coach for the American team in the past.“I’ve witnessed her exceptional work ethic, her ability to work well with other coaches, and most importantly her connection and dedication to her athletes,” Shiffrin said in a statement released by the team. “I believe she can add a huge benefit to my program in the coming years and will provide a fresh and new way of thinking as we move forward.”Harjo will work with Shiffrin’s mother, Eileen, who also has been one of the two-time Olympic gold medalist’s coaches.Shiffrin won a slalom in Are, Sweden, on Saturday for her 87th career World Cup victory, one more than Ingemar Stenmark’s total, a mark once thought untouchable. And Shiffrin is expected to keep adding to her total for quite some time: Monday was only her 28th birthday.She also has clinched her fifth World Cup overall title this season.Harjo replaces Shiffrin’s longtime coach, Mike Day, who left during the world championships last month when Shiffrin told him she wanted to change her staff at the end of the season. Day coached Shiffrin since 2016 and was with her for 65 of her World Cup wins.“I am beyond excited and humbled by the opportunity to work with Mikaela in this capacity,” Harjo said. “I started my World Cup coaching career working with the U.S. women’s tech team, and have always been impressed with Mikaela’s focus, resilience and dedication to the process. Her work ethic is second to none, and I’m looking forward to working with her in this next stage of her career. The thing that strikes me the most about Mikaela is that she has already achieved so much, but she still knows there’s still room for betterment.”U.S. Ski & Snowboard said Harjo was just the second woman to be a head coach for an Alpine women’s team when she joined the Canadians last year and in 2016 became the first woman to be a course-setter for a women’s World Cup technical race.___AP skiing: https://apnews.com/hub/skiing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/13,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833952,Activists: Slow response led to 30 migrant deaths off Libya,"MILAN (AP) — An activist network that supports rescue operations in the Mediterranean Sea is accusing Italy of failing to offer timely assistance to a smugglers’ boat in distress, resulting in a deadly shipwreck that left at least 30 migrants missing and presumed dead in Libya’s search-and-rescue area.Seventeen survivors were rescued in an operation about 100 miles off the Libyan coast Sunday partially coordinated by the Italian Coast Guard. The incident comes two weeks after another shipwreck off the coast of southern Italy left at least 79 people dead.The wrecks have focused attention on Italian and European protocols for responding to suspected smuggling boats; crossings through the deadly central Mediterranean Sea have doubled over past year.The migrants in the most recent incident died when their wooden boat capsized as a merchant vessel, the Froland, approached the boat in distress that was carrying nearly 50 people.Alarm Phone, which notifies authorities of migrants in need of rescue, said it had notified Italian, Libyan and Maltese authorities of the boat’s location, and emphasized that it was in danger due to high waves. It claimed that the migrants died due to “deadly nonassistance by the Italian authorities"" noting that the same boat was spotted nine hours after its initial report by another group that operates surveillance flights.“This delay, one of many systematic delays Alarm Phone has documented over the years, proved to be deadly,” the organization said Sunday. “They would be alive if Europe had not decided to let them drown.”Italy has denied failing to respond to migrant boats in distress, and Premier Giorgia Meloni will answer questions in parliament this week on Italy's response to the shipwreck two weeks ago off Calabria. Italian authorities brought more than 1,000 rescued migrants to Italian shores over the weekend.Regarding Sunday's shipwreck, the Italian Coast Guard said it asked three merchant vessels to respond to the emergency after Libyan authorities notified them that they were not able to. Another boat was already in the area and in direct contact with Alarm Phone.The Froland, which was the first to arrive, rescued 17 survivors. It was bringing two of them to Malta for urgent medical care and would continue to Italy with the other 15.Commercial ships are continuing the search for the missing migrants, assisted by aerial surveillance flights operated by the European border control, Frontex, the Italian Coast Guard said.",2023/3/13,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833953,Biden announces nuclear-powered submarines for Australia,"SAN DIEGO (AP) — President Joe Biden and the leaders of Australia and the United Kingdom on Monday announced that Australia will purchase nuclear-powered attack submarines from the U.S. to modernize its fleet amid growing concern about China’s influence in the Indo-Pacific.Biden flew to San Diego to appear with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak as they hailed an 18-month-old nuclear partnership given the acronym AUKUS — for Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States.The partnership, announced in 2021, enables Australia to access nuclear-powered submarines, which are stealthier and more capable than conventionally powered vessels, as a counterweight to China's military buildup.Biden, appearing sensitive to tensions with China and its criticism of the deal, stressed that the submarines are “nuclear powered, not nuclear armed.”“These boats will not have any nuclear weapons of any kind of them,” he said at an outdoor ceremony at Naval Base Point Loma in San Diego, where he was flanked by Albanese and Sunak. Two submarines, the USS Missouri and the USS Charlotte, were tied up at the next pier in the Pacific Ocean behind the leaders.Albanese said the agreement “represents the biggest single investment in Australia’s defense capability in all of our history.” It's also the first time in 65 years that the U.S. has shared its nuclear propulsion technology, ”and we thank you for it,"" he said.Sunak called AUKUS “the most significant multilateral defense partnership in generations.” He said the U.K. also will share its 60 years of experience running its own submarine fleet with Australian engineers “so they can build their own fleet.”In a joint statement before the formal announcement, the leaders said their countries have worked for decades to sustain peace, stability and prosperity around the world, including in the Indo-Pacific.“We believe in a world that protects freedom and respects human rights, the rule of law, the independence of sovereign states, and the rules-based international order,” they said in the statement, released before their joint appearance in San Diego.“The steps we are announcing today will help us to advance these mutually beneficial objectives in the decades to come,” they said.San Diego is Biden's first stop on a three-day trip to California and Nevada. He will discuss gun violence prevention in Monterey Park, California, where 11 people were killed in a January mass shooting, and his plans to lower prescription drug costs in Las Vegas. The trip will include fundraising stops as Biden steps up his political activity before an expected reelection announcement next month.A fundraiser in Rancho Santa Fe, California, on Monday night is expected to include about 40 attendees and raise $1 million for Democrats, according to a Democratic National Committee official.Australia is buying three, and possibly up to five, Virginia-class boats as part of AUKUS. A future generation of submarines will be built in the U.K. and in Australia with U.S. technology and support.The U.S. will also increase its port visits in Australia to provide it with more familiarity with the nuclear-powered technology before it has such subs of its own. The USS Asheville was docked in Perth, Australia, on Monday, Biden said.Biden also met individually with Sunak and Albanese, an opportunity to coordinate strategy on Russia's war in Ukraine, the global economy and more.Sunak invited Biden, who is of Irish descent, to visit Northern Ireland in April to help celebrate the 25th anniversary of its peace accord, the 1998 Good Friday agreement. Biden replied that it is his “intention” to go to both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.During a subsequent meeting with Albanese, Biden said he planned to visit Australia in May for meetings that will include the leaders of Japan and India.Biden views the partnerships and alliances in the region as cornerstones for U.S. strategy for years to come. Asked if AUKUS would survive if a new, more isolationist president was elected — a veiled reference to Donald Trump, who is running for another term — Biden said yes.The secretly brokered AUKUS deal included the Australian government’s cancellation of a $66 billion contract for a French-built fleet of conventional submarines, which sparked a diplomatic row within the Western alliance that took months to mend.China has argued that the AUKUS deal violates the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. It contends that the transfer of nuclear weapons materials from a nuclear-weapon state to a non-nuclear-weapon state is a “blatant” violation of the spirit of the pact. Australian officials have pushed back against the criticism, arguing that they are working to acquire nuclear-powered, not nuclear-armed, submarines.“The question is really how does China choose to respond because Australia is not backing away from what it — what it sees to be doing in its own interests here,” said Charles Edel, a senior adviser and Australia chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “I think that probably from Beijing’s perspective they’ve already counted out Australia as a wooable mid country. It seemed to have fully gone into the U.S. camp.”Biden downplayed the rivalry with China during his meeting with Albanese.“I don’t view what we’re doing as a challenge to anybody,"" he said.Before he departed for California, Biden spoke at the White House about steps the administration is taking to safeguard depositors and protect against broader economic hardship after the second- and third-largest bank failures in U.S. history.Biden said the nation's financial systems are safe. He said he’d seek to hold accountable those responsible for the bank failures, called for better oversight and regulation of larger banks, and promised that taxpayers would not pay for any losses.___Superville reported from Washington.",2023/3/14,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833974,Hansi Flick: 'There must never be so much pressure again',"Ahead of the announcement of his first post-World Cup squad for friendlies against Peru and Belgium later this month, Germany head coach Hansi Flick has told German media that he feels off-field distractions affected his team's performances in Qatar.After an unexpected 2-1 defeat to Japan, a 1-1 draw against Spain and 4-2 victory over Costa Rica, Germany were left third in Group E on goal difference and exited the tournament in the group stage for the second consecutive time.And Flick feels the political debates off the pitch had an adverse affect.""We felt like we weren't allowed to look forward to this tournament, or enjoy the fact that Germany were taking part in this World Cup,"" said in an interview with Kicker sports magazine and daily broadsheet Süddeutsche Zeitung (SZ) on Monday.""Kai Havertz said clearly during the tournament that he didn't feel much support from back home. Of course we all have our criticisms of the human rights situation in Qatar, we've always said that. But the team felt like they couldn't just play football in peace, that constant statements were expected of them, that they simply couldn't please everyone.""After FIFA threatened sporting sanctions if European captains wore the ""One Love"" armband in protest at Qatar's criminalization of homosexuality, the German players demonstratively covered their mouths ahead of the opening group match against Japan, as if to say they were being muzzled.""Let's be clear again, that decision was made on the Monday and the Japan game was on the Wednesday,"" recalls Flick. ""You could see how much of a burden it was for [captain] Manuel Neuer. As the wearer of the armband, he would have been the face of the protest for the entire world. And I think he felt abandoned.""There must never be so much pressure again, neither on individual players nor on the team. That was simply not good and I hope that we learn from this situation.""Nevertheless, Flick also insisted that Germany's poor performance wasn't just down to off-the-pitch issues, and admitted that his failure to effectively explain and translate defensive strategies in theory onto the pitch had proved costly to the team. Including the defeat by Japan, Germany had deployed 12 different defensive units in 17 matches, with no settled right back in the three games leading up to their World Cup opener.""I know in hindsight that the practical defensive preparations weren't sufficient,"" he said. ""We need to focus more on our patterns when playing four at the back.""In the fallout from their disappointing showing, sporting director Oliver Bierhoff permanently ended his contract with the German Football Federation (DFB).""The pressure on Oliver was enormous,"" said Flick. ""But it was debilitating for me, too, because I'm friends with him. He's a good person and I sympathized.""Former Germany striker and coach Rudi Völler was announced as Bierhoff's replacement in January and Flick praised the 62-year-old.""Rudi was a fixture in German football over the past decades,"" he said. ""He has experience, he knows which levers to use. I enjoyed the exchange with him, we are on the same wavelength.""Now, ahead of the announcement of his first post-Qatar squad for friendlies against Peru and Belgium later this month, Flick is seeking to get the fans back on side, saying:""We want to make Germany and the fans proud again, we owe them that. It's not just about playing to our full potential on the pitch; it's also about showing greater identification. Don't get me wrong, though: it's not as if our players were lacking identification at the World Cup – maybe we just didn't see it enough.""The most important thing is that we play good, passionate football. When the fans realize that we are giving our all for Germany and playing with a lot of heart, then the mood can quickly change again.""Edited by Matt Ford",2023/3/13,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833975,India: Gay marriage recognition referred to high court,"India's Supreme Court passed arguments over granting legal recognition to same-sex marriages to the larger Constitutional Court.The five judge bench will listen to petitions on April 18 while live streaming the proceedings on its website and YouTube.The conservative Indian government led by Hindu nationalist Prime Minister Narendra Modi informed the Supreme Court that it is against same-sex marriage and any changes were up to parliament but not the courts.The government said that ""any interference"" was likely to result in ""complete havoc with the delicate balance of personal laws in the country and accepted societal values.”Seen as a milestone event for the LGBT rights in the country, the case moves to the higher Constitutional Court.The Supreme Court decriminalized homosexuality in 2018 by doing away with a colonial-era ban on gay sex.The Constitutional Court will determine whether recognition of same-sex marriage is valid according to the constitution of India.India's Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing the government in court, said, ""The parliament will have to debate and take a call whether in the view of societal ethos and several other factors which go into lawmaking, whether we would like this institution to be recognized.""Niharika Karanjawala, a lawyer representing one of the petitioners, said, ""We are very pleased that this matter has gone to a constitutional bench as we consider it to be an issue of fundamental constitutional rights.”If successful, the country would become only the second Asian country after Taiwan to recognize same sex unions.Same-sex marriage remains a sensitive issue in India and openly speaking about homosexuality remains a taboo for many. India's 1.4 billion people lean socially conservative and religious.The government urged the Supreme Court to reject challenges to the current legal framework lodged by LGBT couples.Recently, more than 15 appeals, some by gay couples, have been filed asking the court to recognize same-sex marriages, triggering a legal face-off with Modi's government.India recognized transgender individuals as the ""third gender” in 2014 and in 2018, the highest court recognized sexual orientation as protected under a fundamental right to privacy.LGBT activists argue that while the ruling asserted their constitutional rights, it is still unjust that they lack legal backing for their unions.dmn/ar (AFP, Reuters)",2023/3/13,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833976,Why the British are suddenly so strike-happy,"Around 40,000 junior doctors in the United Kingdom began a three-day walkout on Monday that is expected to be even more disruptive to the country's healthcare system than recent industrial action by nurses and ambulance staff.A wave of strikes in recent months has disrupted life in Britain as workers react to decades-high inflation that reached 11.1% in October 2022.In recent months,public transport staff, teachers, postal workers, and border staff have all walked off the job to demand higher pay and better working conditions in recent months.Until recently, many Britons would sneer at French or German workers, believing that their continental counterparts were ""always on strike,"" and that such walkouts were bad for business.But as the UK emerged from the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of Brexit began to kick in, the country's economic malaise was plain to see.Years of austerity following the 2008 financial crisis weakened public services to the point that they are often struggling to provide basic levels of support. The National Health Service (NHS) is buckling under the strain of an aging and increasingly unhealthy population as well as a huge backlog of treatments that were delayed during the pandemic.Striking workers complain of an obsession by successive Conservative governments with efficiencies that they say has led to years of underinvestment and left them with unreasonable workloads and falling real incomes. Worst still, the full economic effects of Brexit have yet to be felt.""Over the last 12 years, Britain has experienced the longest phase of real wage stagnation since the early 19th century,"" Scott Lavery, a lecturer in politics at the University of Sheffield, told DW. ""Since the financial crisis, we've seen sustained real wage decline.""Over the last 15 years, real incomes — after accounting for inflation — fell 5.1%, according to UK government figures. This coupled with the inflation crisis, which Lavery said was ""eroding living standards dramatically,"" has left British workers struggling to stay afloat.French workers have also hit the streets recently over soaring inflation. But their main priority is to oppose planned reforms to the country's generous pension system that allows retirement at 62. German unions, meanwhile, have succeeded in negotiating several inflation-busting pay deals, including one with Deutsche Post last weekend that favors the lower paid and even includes trainees.""In France, there is a sense of defending an existing standard of living, while in the UK, people feel that whatever used to exist has gone,"" Sam Moorecroft, vice president of the Trades Union Council in the city of Sheffield, told DW.Moorecroft believes the seeds of today's misery were sown in 1979 when Margaret Thatcher took office as prime minister and proceeded to crush the trade union movement. She blamed generous pro-union laws introduced by the Labour Party for allowing widespread strike action to bring the country to its knees.""When Thatcher defeated the miners' in the 1980s, many believed that the trade union movement had been completely defeated. But now, there is a move to return to the same level of union participation as the past,"" Moorecroft added.That ambition is yet to be seen in the statistics. Union membership peaked in 1979 and by 2021 had more than halved to 23.1% of the workforce or 6.44 million people. Union members tend to be over 35 and almost half have been working for the same company for a decade or more, but that is changing.Unions are reaching out to younger workers, who are more likely to be on the minimum wage, and a third of whom are on zero-hours contracts. The Trades Union Congress (TUC) calculated recently that nearly 90% of those under 30 on low to median incomes in Britain work in the private sector, which is mostly non-unionized.The Low Pay Commission, which advises the UK government, found last month that many UK employers were failing to incorporate annual hikes to the national minimum wage — a phenomenon known as wage theft. Before the pandemic, around 22% of minimum wage earners were underpaid but by April 2022, that figure had grown to almost a third.Moorecroft noted how non-unionized workplaces are increasingly mobilizing for better pay and conditions, citing a recent strike at Amazon's largest UK fulfillment center, in Coventry. Around 300 workers at the 1,400-strong warehouse walked out several times over the past two months over low wages and grueling round-the-clock shift patterns.While the US tech firm's French and German workers have previously staged several strikes, particularly around the Black Friday sales, Amazon has so far refused to recognize Britain's GMB union, which fights for the rights of the firm'semployees in the UK.Public support for walkouts in the UK has always been mixed as memories of the Winter of Discontent linger. During the coldest months of 1978-9, the country was brought to a standstill by large-scale private and public sector strikes that caused food shortages, weeks of uncollected garbage and, in one city, the dead to lay unburied.This time, however, with public services already defective, the cost of living crisis hitting everyone's pockets and living standards lower than a decade ago, the public's backing for strikes is noticeably higher.A poll by Sky News in January found that 63% of Britons strongly support or somewhat support walkouts by healthcare workers, with 49% backing wider public sector action.""There is certainly a sense that those core public sector workers that kept the economy running during the pandemic have strong public support ... particularly nurses, despite their strikes having potentially life or death consequences,"" Lavery said.Recent signs of progress toward ending the wage disputes are encouraging, despite the government having argued that inflation-busting pay increases would drive prices higher. Nurses, midwives and ambulance staff last week called off their planned strikes as negotiations looked positive.Britain is, however, unlikely to pivot to a more European labor market structure. After all, the country's decision to leave the EU was built on a promise to create a low-tax Singapore-on-Thames. The country's heavy indebtedness last year forced a 70-year-high tax burden on workers, which put that dream on hold for now.Prime Minister Rishi Sunak proposed new legislation in January that would enforce ""minimum service levels"" in key areas of the public sector, including education and healthcare, which would hamper strikes.""[This] would effectively debar some workers from taking legal industrial action,"" Lavery told DW. ""The UK already has some of the most restrictive anti-union legislation in the Western world and Sunak is trying to tighten up further ... so he's far from being a peacemaker.""Edited by: Ashutosh Pandey",2023/3/13,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833977,East Asia grapples with an aging society,"""I'm afraid to have children,"" Seha [surname withheld], a resident of Seoul, the South Korean capital, told DW. Although she feels it would bring her happiness, the 22-year-old believes that having children could stop her from pursuing her career.""I've seen many married women quit their jobs to take care of their children,"" she said, adding that her peers share her concerns.The birth rate in South Korea has fallen steadily since 2015. Last year was the third in a row in which Asia's fourth-largest economy saw more deaths than births.Additionally, the country recently broke its own record for the world's lowest fertility rate. The average number of children a woman in South Korea is expected to have fell to 0.78 in 2022, down from 0.81 a year earlier — far below the rate of 2.1 needed to maintain natural population growth.This is not a phenomenon unique to South Korea. Neighboring Japan has long been stymied by demographic problems, particularly with its fast-growing elderly population. The issue has such an impact that Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida even said in January that the country is on the verge of social dysfunction.The Chinese are also having fewer children, delaying childbirth, or not having kids at all. Last year, the country's population dropped for the first time in six decades.East Asia now has the lowest fertility rate of any global region, at 1.2 births per woman, compared to 2.3 worldwide, according to the Population Reference Bureau.The reasons putting women off having children are similar across the region: astronomical housing costs, the financial strain of raising children in a competitive society, and women increasingly prioritizing their careers.""You need at least €746,304 ($800,000) to buy an apartment in or near Seoul,"" Heedoh Roh, a public employee planning his wedding, told DW. ""For now, we decided to rent a house.""Recent data from the 2021 Korea Housing Survey shows that an average worker can only buy property in the capital if they save their entire income for just over 14 years.Roh and his fiance plan to have kids, and as government employees they can enjoy parental leave for up to three years. Roh said the policy could be a ""great motivation"" for them to become parents in a country where many companies do not offer parental leave.Falling birth rates are not the only demographic-related predicament that East Asia is facing. In Japan, nearly a third of the population is made up of people aged 65 and older.The country also has one of the world's highest life expectancies. In 2022, almost one in 1,500 Japanese people were at least 100 years old, compared with roughly one per 5,000 people globally.The shrinking number of youth will mean the country has a smaller workforce and won't be able to collect as much money in taxes, negatively impacting the economy, said Thang Leng, an associate professor in the Department of Japanese Studies at the National University of Singapore.By 2050, one in three people in East Asia could be over the age of 65, according to the United Nations World Population Prospects.China is facing an even more daunting challenge. With more than 1.4 billion people, its population is ""aging on an unprecedented scale,"" said Sabrina Luk, an assistant professor of Public Policy and Global Affairs at the Nanyang Technological University of Singapore.An increasingly elderly society, along with the ""4-2-1"" family structure (four grandparents, two parents and one child), which resulted from the one-child policy, means a heavier ""financial and caregiver"" burden placed on younger generations, Luk told DW.Experts fear China's one-child policy was lifted too late. After enforcing strict family planning policies for decades, allowing married couples to now have up to three children has not led to an increase in births.In fact, apart from an uptick in 2016, when the two-child policy was introduced, the number of babies born in China has declined by nearly half, from 17.86 million in 2016 down to just 9.56 million in 2022.South Korea's attempts at slowing the trend have had similar results. Over the past 16 years, the country has spent €195.6 billion ($210 billion) trying to boost birth rates, but has failed to turn the tide, President Yoon Suk Yeol said late last year.Other than financial incentives, attempts to ease child care burdens for working parents require ""genuine support from employers,"" said Thang, pointing out that many fathers are unwilling to take paternity leave over fears of disadvantages at work.Meanwhile, as maternity leave in China lasts for at least 98 days, women with no children or just one child often face workplace discrimination. Some employers are wary of female workers being unavailable after giving birth, said Luk.While many countries in other regions have turned to foreign labor to supplement their shrinking workforces, East Asian nations have not yet fully embraced the idea.In Japan, foreigners make up just 1.5% of the registered population — a figure much lower than in other industrialized nations. In Germany, for example, the ratio is about 15.8%.However, Thang expects to see more reliance on foreign workers in the future. South Korea is already adopting more migrant-friendly policies, with plans underway to set up an immigration agency.China, on the other hand, is not ""a popular destination for immigrants,"" said Luk.In 2020, even with foreign residents of Hong Kong and Macao combined, they only accounted for just 0.1% of the total workforce.To make matters worse, more people are moving out of China than into it. Since the UN started compiling statistics in 1950, China has had a net negative number of migrants. For now, governments in East Asia will continue to search for viable solutions to their shrinking populations.Edited by: Leah Carter",2023/3/13,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833978,How Ireland's soccer players forced change and won a World Cup spot,"With her country having fallen short of another World Cup, Ireland's Aine O'Gorman was done.After 12 years, 100 caps and a long battle for equality with her own federation that caught the world's attention, O'Gorman called time on her international career in 2018.Five years later, she's starting to think about a World Cup debut in front of 80,000 fans in, and against, Australia. But perhaps more importantly, her courage — and that of her teammates back in 2017 — has changed the landscape for women playing in the Republic of Ireland.""I always thought it was possible to have a professional setup in Ireland,"" she told DW a few days after she scored a last-minute winner for the re-formed Shamrock Rovers in the first round of the newly-professionalized Women's National League in early March. ""I think it takes someone just to lead the way.""Though she was referring to her club, the league and its administrators, O'Gorman's part in the widespread changes that have led Ireland to the biggest stage is not to be underestimated.That was one of the leading faces and voices of the Irish squad that reluctantly threatened to boycott a 2017 match against Slovakia in protest at their treatment by the Football Association of Ireland (FAI). Players complained publicly of having to change in public toilets on the way to matches and share tracksuits with youth squads.That protest and press conference, which drew global media attention, was one of the key factors in a revolution in women's football in Ireland. Subsequently, a raft of institutional changes, including the resignation of controversial former CEO and UEFA Executive Committee member John Delaney, led to an equal pay deal signed in 2021.""When you're still playing, you're in the moment, you just focus on the next game, the next match. You don't really look back on your career and think how proud you'll be of that moment. But I think it was important not just for women's football in Ireland, but for women's sports in Ireland in general,"" O'Gorman said.""Conditions have improved massively, we have the full backing of the FAI and great sponsors on board. But it's still hard to believe that we're going to a World Cup.""That's particularly true for O'Gorman. Having quit the international scene five years ago, the 33-year-old was tempted back in 2020 by the changes at the FAI and the overtures of Dutch coach Vera Pauw. Now her country's third most-capped player, O'Gorman was picked by Pauw for the 1-0 playoff win over Scotland last year that made Irish footballing history.That Ireland, and O'Gorman, could find a path forward from the depths of 2017 seems particularly pertinent in a World Cup year that's been dominated by stories of international sides fighting their own federations. France and Spain have seen huge public disputes between players and staff while Canada's players wanted to go on strike against their own federation. They were subsequently backed in their position, which bears some similarity to Ireland's in 2017, by world champions the USA and European champions, England.O'Gorman is disappointed to see such prominent countries still fighting the same battles she and her teammates won but sees hope in the Irish victory.""I don't think we were really aware of the impact until it all kicked off and we got the global support,"" she said. ""Anything is possible, I think, when you stick together and have the same goal to better their conditions.""The fact we've even seen the USA have to go through a CBA [collective bargaining agreement] and the Canadian team going through what they are ... that's the world champions and the Olympic champions. It shows you have to keep pushing and improving on it.""The stand that O'Gorman and her teammates took back then was also about future generations, she added. She was the only player based in Ireland in the squad that beat Scotland in that playoff in front of just over 10,000 people at Hampden Park in Glasgow with the rest spread around the English, German, American, Scottish and Australian leagues.She hopes that won't be the case for long, with clubs like Shamrock Rovers offering ""more opportunity now for players to stay in Ireland and play at a good level.""With a pair of friendlies coming up against the USA in April, and fellow World Cup sides Zambia and France lined up in June and July, Ireland are keen to test themselves before taking on Australia on July 20 in Sydney, a city with a significant Irish population.""We're playing in an 80,000 seater stadium [Sydney's Olympic stadium] in the first game and we're expecting probably half of that to be full of green. So it's going to be a really special occasion and one that us players are all preparing for and hoping to be on the flight to Australia.""If O'Gorman does make that long flight, she'll know she'll truly have earned her place.",2023/3/13,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833981,Lineker goes from soccer star to TV host to liberal champion,"It looks like the BBC picked on the wrong guy.In choosing to make an example of Gary Lineker by suspending him for criticizing the British government’s asylum policy on Twitter, the network went up against a national treasure.In soccer terms, call it an own-goal.Because, as the rapidly moving saga unraveled over a weekend when English soccer coverage — for some — was decimated by Lineker’s absence from the BBC studio, it quickly became clear there was only going to be one winner.The 62-year-old Lineker, who was reinstated by Britain’s national broadcaster on Monday, is a former soccer star — indeed, one of England’s greatest players — who has transitioned into being a slick, witty and knowledgeable TV personality and an all-around media darling.For that reason, the support for him in the soccer world and further afield was hardly surprising and something the BBC badly underestimated ahead of its climbdown in a controversy entirely of its own making.In fact, Lineker — with his hair gray and his Twitter following up to nearly 9 million — might almost be as big a deal now than he was in the 1980s when he was racking up the goals for England’s national team and high-profile clubs like Barcelona, Tottenham and Everton.As a player, he was the ultimate penalty-box poacher — rarely did he attempt a shot from outside the area, never mind score from one. And, somewhat remarkably, he never received a yellow or red card in his 16-year career.“I never tackled anyone, that’s probably why,” Lineker said with a smile in a 2021 interview with the BBC.He saved his best work for in front of the goal. He scored 48 goals in 80 games for England, which places him fourth on the nation team’s all-time list, and was the leading scorer at the 1986 World Cup in Mexico. Not bad for a guy who, before becoming a professional soccer player, often worked at his father's fruit-and-vegetable market stall in his home city of Leicester.In English league play, he scored 113 goals in 170 matches for Leicester, Everton and Tottenham from 1983-92. In the middle of that period was a three-year spell at Spanish club Barcelona, where he scored 42 goals in 103 league games — including a hat trick against Real Madrid in the “clasico” — to earn himself the nickname “El Matador.”After finishing his playing career with a trailblazing move to Japanese team Grampus Eight from 1992-94, Lineker embarked on a media career that didn’t immediately seem a natural fit for someone who, initially, was awkward, wooden and slightly timid in front of the cameras, despite having appeared in TV commercials for British potato chip company Walkers.That would soon change. He switched from being a pundit to a presenter at the BBC in the late 1990s, hosting soccer and later golf — such as the Masters and the British Open — for the corporation. His appearances on BBC comedy game show “They Think It’s All Over” helped him come out of his shell and exhibit the kind of wry humor and quick-wittedness for which he has become known.Lineker then started to excel as the main host of “Match of the Day” — a late-night soccer highlights program that has been running since the 1960s and is regarded as an institution in Britain. He even presented one show in his underpants, sticking to a promise he made if Leicester won the Premier League title, which the team did in 2016 despite pre-season odds of 5,000-1.He used his status as a freelancer to work for other broadcasters such as NBC, Al Jazeera and most recently BT Sport, which he left in 2021 saying he wanted to spend time traveling with his sons to watch his beloved Leicester on the team’s campaign in the Europa League.It’s only in recent years, by which time he had become the BBC’s highest-paid TV personality and a master of his craft, that he has emerged as a champion of liberal causes through his regular Twitter posts. He welcomed refugees into his home to live with him for some weeks in 2020 and ’21, and became more bullish in his comments about immigration.“How can anyone have a total lack of empathy for people in the most dire circumstances?” he said in a separate 2021 interview.Lineker accepted it would make him a target for the right, but it has strengthened his status as one of Britain’s most popular figures to many.Hence the outpouring of support over the past few days after the BBC took him off the air for describing the government’s plan to detain and deport immigrants arriving by boat as “an immeasurably cruel policy directed at the most vulnerable people in language that is not dissimilar to that used by Germany in the 30s.” It was a tweet that, according to the BBC, breached its impartiality rules and was pounced upon by the Conservative government as offensive and unacceptable.In solidarity with Lineker, his “Match of the Day” colleagues, like English soccer greats Alan Shearer and Ian Wright, and the program’s commentators said they were not willing to work. And there was a general outcry at the show being reduced to 20 minutes — instead of its usual 80 minutes — and without commentary.Now, Lineker is back. He will return to British screens for Saturday’s “Match of the Day,” which will no doubt start with arguably the most talked-about figure in Britain these past few days making a joke about a saga that quickly spun out of the BBC’s control.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833982,"AP source: Bills rework Allen, Miller deals to get under cap","ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) — The Buffalo Bills have worked their way under the salary cap in time for the free-agent signing period by freeing up more than $30 million in space after restructuring the contracts of quarterback Josh Allen and edge rusher Von Miller, a person with direct knowledge of the moves confirmed to The Associated Press on Monday night.The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because the team has not publicly disclosed the contract restructurings, which were first reported by ESPN.com.The new contract terms were not revealed, with Allen having six years left on an eight-year, $258 million deal, and Miller entering the second season of a six-year deal worth up to $120 million.The restructurings, coupled with freeing up $6 million in cap space by signing linebacker Matt Milano to a contact extension on Sunday, leaves the Bills with about $20 million to work with entering the signing period Wednesday.Buffalo already began using its newfound dollars by reaching an agreement to sign Dallas Cowboys guard Connor McGovern to a three-year contract, a second person with direct knowledge of the deal told the AP earlier in the day. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because the deal does not become official until the NFL’s signing period opens on Wednesday. The agreement was first reported by NFL.com.McGovern was selected by the Cowboys in the third round of the 2019 draft, and had 29 starts in 45 games with the team over the past three years after spending his rookie season on injured reserve with a torn pectoral muscle. The 25-year-old addresses a pending need for Buffalo, with starting left guard Rodger Saffold and his backup, Bobby Hart, both pending unrestricted free agents.In other moves, the Bills announced reaching agreements to re-sign punter Sam Martin and linebacker Tyler Matakevich and backup defensive back Cam Lewis before they were eligible to hit the free agent market.Martin agreed to a three-year contract following his first season in Buffalo, in which his 47.7 average yards per punt ranked third on the team’s single-season list. The 10-year veteran was signed by the Bills in September after the team abruptly released rookie Matt Araiza, who was accused in a civil lawsuit of being involved in the gang rape of a 17-year-old girl while at San Diego State.The 33-year-old Martin spent his first seven NFL seasons in Detroit and two in Denver.Matakevich is set to return for a fourth season in Buffalo after agreeing to a one-year contract. The seventh-year player, who spent his first four seasons in Pittsburgh, has spent a majority of his career being used in special team roles.Lewis agreed to a one-year contract. The undrafted free agent out of the University at Buffalo, returns to the Bills for a fourth season, where he’s filled in at cornerback and safety, and appeared in a career-best 13 games last season.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/3/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833983,Alaska's Willow oil project is controversial. Here's why.,"JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) — The Biden administration is approving a major oil project on Alaska's petroleum-rich North Slope that supporters say represents an economic lifeline for Indigenous communities in the region but environmentalists say is counter to President Joe Biden's climate goals.The decision on ConocoPhillips Alaska's Willow project, in a federal oil reserve roughly the size of Indiana, was revealed Monday.WHAT IS THE WILLOW PROJECT?The project could produce up to 180,000 barrels of oil a day, according to the company — about 1.5% of total U.S. oil production. Willow is currently the largest proposed oil project on U.S. public land. Alaska Republican U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan said the development could be “one of the biggest, most important resource development projects in our state’s history.”So far this year, around 498,000 barrels of oil a day have flowed through the trans-Alaska pipeline, well below the late-1980s peak of 2.1 million barrels.ConocoPhillips Alaska had proposed five drilling sites as part of the project. The U.S. Bureau of Land Management approved three, which it said would include up to 199 total wells. ConocoPhillips Alaska said it welcomed Monday's decision.The company also agreed to give up rights to about 68,000 acres (27,500 hectares) in existing leases within the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, where Willow is located. The action reduces the project’s freshwater use and eliminates all infrastructure related to the two rejected drill sites, including approximately 11 miles (18 kilometers) of roads, 20 miles (32 kilometers) of pipelines and 133 acres (54 hectares) of gravel, all of which reduces potential impacts to caribou migration and subsistence users, the U.S. Interior Department said.Using the oil from Willow would produce the equivalent of more 263 million tons (239 million metric tons) of greenhouse gases over the project's 30-year life, roughly equal to the combined emissions from 1.7 million passenger cars over the same time period. It would have a roughly 8% reduction in emissions compared with Houston-based ConocoPhillips’ favored approach.IS THERE SUPPORT FOR WILLOW?There is widespread political support in Alaska, including from the bipartisan congressional delegation, Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy and state lawmakers.There also is “majority consensus” in support in the North Slope region, said Nagruk Harcharek, president of the group Voice of the Arctic Iñupiat, whose members include leaders from across much of that region. Supporters have called the project balanced and say communities would benefit from taxes generated by Willow to invest in infrastructure and provide public services.City of Nuiqsut Mayor Rosemary Ahtuangaruak, whose community of about 525 people is closest to the proposed development, is a prominent opponent who is worried about impacts on caribou and her residents' subsistence lifestyles. But opposition there isn't universal. The local Alaska Native village corporation has expressed support.“Today, the people of Alaska were heard,” said U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, a Democrat who also is Yup'ik. “After years of consistent, determined advocacy for this project, from people all across the state and from every walk of life, the Willow Project is finally moving forward.""Ahtuangaruak had said that she felt that voices like hers were being drowned out.WHAT ARE THE POLITICS OF THE DECISION?Biden's decision pits Alaska lawmakers against environmental groups and many Democrats in Congress who say the project is out of step with his goals to slash planet-warming carbon emissions in half by 2030 and move to clean energy. Environmentalists say approval of the project represents a betrayal by Biden, who promised during the 2020 campaign to end new oil and gas drilling on federal lands. Environmentalist groups had urged the project's rejection.Biden has made fighting climate change a top priority and backed a landmark law to accelerate expansion of clean energy such as wind and solar power and move the U.S. away from the oil, coal and gas.He has faced attacks from Republican lawmakers who blame him for gasoline price spikes that occurred after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.DID THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION SUPPORT WILLOW EARLY ON?Justice Department attorneys in 2021 defended in court an environmental review conducted during the Trump administration that approved the project. A federal judge later found flaws with the analysis, setting aside the approval and returning the matter to the land management agency for further work. That led to the review released last month that laid the groundwork for Monday's announcement.Sen. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, said the decision will not only ""mean jobs and revenue for Alaska, it will be resources that are needed for the country and for our friends and allies. The administration listened to Alaska voices. They listened to the delegation as we pressed the case for energy security and national security.”WHAT ABOUT GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS?Federal officials under former President Donald Trump claimed increased domestic oil drilling would result in fewer net global emissions because it would decrease petroleum imports. U.S. companies adhere to stricter environmental standards than those in other countries, they argued.After outside scientists rejected the claim and a federal judge agreed, the Interior Department changed how it calculates emissions.The latest review, under the Biden administration, received pushback over its inclusion of a suggestion that 50% of Willow’s net emissions could be offset, including by planting more trees on national forests to capture and store carbon dioxide. Reforestation work on federal lands was something the administration already planned and needed to meet its broader climate goals. The reforestation proposal was dropped from the final decision.The Willow project “is about producing oil for decades when the U.S. needs to be on a steep reduction path,” said Michael Lazarus, a senior scientist at the Stockholm Environment Institute. “I see the political pressure the administration is under, but the science doesn’t change.""WHAT ABOUT BIDEN’S PROMISES TO CURTAIL OIL DRILLING?Biden suspended oil and gas lease sales after taking office and promised to overhaul the government’s fossil fuels program.Attorneys general from oil-producing states convinced a federal judge to lift the suspension -- a ruling later overturned by an appeals court. The administration ultimately dropped its resistance to leasing in a compromise over last year’s climate law. The measure requires the Interior Department to offer for sale tens of millions of acres of onshore and offshore leases before it can approve any renewable energy leases.The number of new drilling permits to companies with federal leases spiked in Biden’s first year as companies stockpiled drilling rights and officials said they were working through a backlog of applications from the Trump administration. Approvals dropped sharply in fiscal year 2022.The Biden administration has offered less acreage for lease than previous administrations. But environmentalists say the administration hasn't done enough.The decision on Willow, one of the most significant of Interior Secretary Deb Haaland’s tenure, was signed by her deputy, Tommy Beaudreau, who grew up in Alaska and briefed state lawmakers on the project Monday.Haaland referred to the project in a video statement on Twitter as a “difficult and complex issue” involving leases issued by prior administrations.“As a result, we had limited decision space, but we focused on how to reduce the project's footprint and minimize its impacts to people and to wildlife,” said Haaland, who had opposed Willow as a New Mexico congresswoman before becoming Interior secretary.WHAT OTHER ACTIONS IS THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION TAKING?On Sunday, the administration announced that Biden would indefinitely place off limits to future oil and gas leasing nearly 3 million acres (1.2 million hectares) of the Arctic Ocean and impose new protections in the petroleum reserve. The withdrawal of the offshore area ensures that important habitat for whales, seals, polar bears and other wildlife “will be protected in perpetuity from extractive development,″ the White House said in a statement.The action completes protections for the entire Beaufort Sea Planning Area, building upon former President Barack Obama’s 2016 withdrawal of the Chukchi Sea Planning Area and the majority of the Beaufort Sea, the White House said.The Biden administration also said it plans to consider additional protections for the more than 13 million acres (5.3 million hectares) within the petroleum reserve that are designated as special areas for their wildlife, subsistence, scenic or other values. Details weren't immediately clear. The administration said it would make available the proposed rule for public comment in the coming months.The Interior Department limited oil and gas leasing in a 2022 decision to 11.8 million of the roughly 23-million-acre (4.8 million of the roughly 9.3-million-hectare) National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska and designated the remaining roughly 11 million acres (4.5 million hectares) as closed to leasing.The petroleum reserve on Alaska's North Slope was set aside a century ago for future oil production.___Brown reported from Billings, Mont., and Daly reported from Washington.",2023/3/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833984,Rights group: Egypt withheld documents of dissidents abroad,"Egypt's authorities refused to issue or renew passports, birth certificates and other documents for more than two dozens journalists, critics and lawyers living abroad, a leading rights group said Monday.The U.S.-based group Human Rights Watch said the refusals are a sign that Egypt is widening its clampdown on dissent. “The government is ramping up efforts to punish and silence those abroad,” said Adam Coogle, deputy Middle East and North Africa director at HRW.The group said it spoke to 26 Egyptians abroad, including dissidents, journalists and lawyers, whose requests for essential documents were rejected by the Egyptian authorities. Those affected live in Turkey, Germany, Malaysia, Qatar and two countries in Africa and the Gulf.Egypt’s authorities did not immediately respond to a request by The Associated Press for comment.Since coming to power in 2014, President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi’s government has overseen a wide-ranging crackdown on dissent, jailing thousands. Authorities have targeted not only Islamist political opponents but also pro-democracy activists, journalists and online critics. Thousands have since fled the country.Those interviewed by HRW said challenging Cairo's refusal to provide documents was ""nearly impossible,'' while some were told to return to Egypt to solve their issue. Several interviewees said Egypt’s refusal to do so was inhibiting their ability to live and travel abroad.HRW did not reveal the identity or occupations of the 26, but said most of them had no pending criminal cases against them in Egypt.In 2019, HRW estimated that as many as 60,000 political prisoners are incarcerated in Egyptian prisons, although Egypt's government has rejected this claim. The Committee to Protect Journalists ranks Egypt third, behind China and Turkey, in detaining journalists.___This story corrects the year President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi came to power.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833985,‘The Last of Us’ TV adaptation resonates beyond gamers,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — In the HBO series “The Last of Us,” a fungal infection has taken over Earth, rendering the United States an apocalyptic landscape protagonists Joel and Ellie need to traverse. Fans unfamiliar with the video game, from which the series was adapted, might assume this is just another zombie show packed with action and gore.However, the story and the characters have subverted expectations and received praise from all corners. “The Last of Us,” whose first season concluded Sunday, has not only won over gamers with high expectations, but also people who don't play video games. The series premiere drew 4.7 million viewers in the U.S., based on Nielsen and HBO data, making for HBO’s second-largest debut, behind “House of the Dragon."" HBO said the finale drew a series high of 8.2 million people, despite airing against the Oscars.“No one could have anticipated this, this reaction and how positive it’s been and how broad it’s been in its reach,” said Neil Druckmann, Naughty Dog co-president and the creator and writer of the video game, whose critically acclaimed first installment was released on Playstation 3 a decade ago.“And to see a whole bunch of new people connecting with these characters … and hearing how they interpret the material and what they like or not like, it’s just been really fascinating to me,” said Druckmann, who was also the co-creator, writer and an executive producer on the show.The show explores relatable themes like coming of age, grief, finding hope and parenthood. It’s not all about zombies — the Infected create the conflict, but aren’t the only antagonists, for there are worse and scarier things lurking in this apocalypse. The emotional plot and complex characters have resonated with fans outside the traditional genres the series fits into.“I’m actually kind of afraid of horror and zombie things and whatnot. Normally, I wouldn’t watch that type of show,” said Victoria Jin, a 24-year-old law student.Jin never played the game but started watching the show with friends; what made her stay invested was the third episode, which explores the relationship between survivalist Bill (Nick Offerman) and his partner Frank (Murray Bartlett). The standout episode told a story of love and hope in a grim world.“It’s the drama, there’s a lot of heartbreak, there’s human emotion and relationships, and that definitely is what keeps me coming back to it,” Jin said. “And just like, come on, Pedro Pascal. I feel like that should be enough of a draw on itself.”The performances haven’t gone unnoticed by fans, who are already speculating about Emmy nominations for both Pascal and Bella Ramsey, who plays Ellie (between his character Joel and his role on Disney Plus' “The Mandalorian,” Pascal has become the internet’s favorite dad).The show’s plot is simple, but the key to its success is complex characters, explained avid gamer, writer and filmmaker Michael Tucker.“I think, because it’s focused on those character arcs and relationships, and how the story world puts pressure to force those forward, those things are really accessible and universal,” said Tucker, the creator of the YouTube channel Lessons from the Screenplay.The television format allows the plot and characters to develop slowly, unlike a movie. With a video game played for hours, that length helps the viewers develop empathy toward the characters.Video games being recognized as a form of storytelling isn’t new. Kim Shay, 26, isn’t a gamer, but she saw social media buzz around the video game years before the HBO series was even announced. She watched full playthrough videos of the game on YouTube and was immediately captivated by the story.“The storytelling is immaculate on that game,” Shay said.Video game adaptations are turning heads in Hollywood. Netflix has had success with its own video game adaptations, “Arcane,” adapted from the online game “League of Legends,” and “Castlevania,” adapted from a gothic horror action-adventure video game series of the same name. But at the same time, others have flopped.Creating a successful adaptation isn’t as simple as recreating the game shot for shot. But having the game's creators involved in the project was something that made “The Last of Us” special. While Druckmann played a big role in the series, voice actors from the video game acted on the show as well — including Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson, who voiced Joel and Ellie in the game. Creators need to have an open mind on what stays and what changes, Druckmann said.What added to the success of the show was the natural partnership between him and showrunner Craig Mazin. In initial conversations, Druckmann could see that Mazin was a fan of “The Last of Us” and took the story seriously.""He’s played multiple times and thought about these characters, the relationships and what they mean. And clearly it had a profound impact on him,” Druckmann said.As Hollywood looks toward more video games, Druckmann emphasizes that the love and hard work that goes into a video game should still be the main priority to its creators.“It’s my love for video games, it's paramount,” said Druckmann. “The stuff that’s exciting to me is we’re always trying to do something new, because the language of what a video game story can be, is broader than any other medium.”",2023/3/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833986,Connor McDavid puts NHL on notice with goal-scoring frenzy,"Connor McDavid is must-see entertainment and not just for hockey fans.The best player in the world is having such an off-the-charts year that his peers can't help but watch his highlights. The Edmonton Oilers captain has already set career highs with 55 goals and 127 points, and there are still 15 games left in the regular season.""He’s from a different planet,"" Washington Capitals captain Alex Ovechkin said.McDavid's latest act has been as a goal-scorer after spending his first seven NHL seasons as more of a playmaker. He's shooting first, asking questions later and making the entire league take notice.“He's dominating,” Pittsburgh Penguins captain Sidney Crosby said. “He just continues to get better. And as any player, that’s what you want. But when it’s a guy like that, it’s scary.”Trying to defend McDavid is a scary proposition for opponents, and it has been since he broke into the league in 2015 with his dazzling stick work and blinding speed. He has already won the Hart Trophy as MVP twice and four times took home the Art Ross Trophy for the most points in a season.McDavid is authoring another MVP-worthy season this time while running away with the goal-scoring title. Much like he focused on improving in the faceoff circle and rounding out his two-way game in previous years, he made a concerted effort to score more himself and surpassed the 50-goal mark for the first time in his career.“I've never been an elite goal-scorer,” McDavid said. “I’ve kind of always been a pass-first guy. I kind of always said that I take the best available play, but this year I just feel like I’ve been put in some good spots, obviously playing with some good players, and the puck’s going in. I think that’s ultimately just the difference.”The difference between McDavid and the next-closest scorer, teammate Leon Draisaitl, is 29 points. Boston's David Pastrnak ranks second in the league in goals and he's still nine back of McDavid.After six mulitgoal games in his last 10, McDavid is on pace for the highest single-season total since the salary cap era began in 2005, surpassing the 65 Ovechkin sored in 2007-08. Ovechkin, who trails only Wayne Gretzky on the career goals list and is 79 away from breaking the record, marvels at what McDavid is doing.“How he play the game, how he control the puck, how he control the speed, he’s fun to watch,” Ovechkin said. “It’s great that he’s able to show not only one year, but he’s consistently doing that over and over.”Crosby, himself a two-time MVP and three-time Stanley Cup winner, is impressed by McDavid's eagerness to evolve. Dallas Stars coach Peter DeBoer uses McDavid as an example for young players of how to isolate a weakness and turn into a strength.“I think that’s a lesson for everybody that this guy just wasn’t touched by the hand of God with talent,” DeBoer said. “He’s worked at it and at his game, at getting better.”Dylan Strome witnessed McDavid honing aspects of his game when they were junior teammates in Erie, Pennsylvania.“He’s finding new ways to become more creative,” Strome said. “Sometimes you wonder what more can he do?”Strome, now playing with Ovechkin in Washington, sees McDavid scoring from different angles, shooting from further away from the net and attempting more one-timers. Some of that came from watching Crosby, reigning MVP Auston Matthews and others, and studying how they shoot the puck.“So many guys go about it so many different ways,"" McDavid said. “It’s always a chance to learn, watching other guys.""McDavid is constantly learning and also inspiring some of the NHL's best. Nathan MacKinnon, who was one of the best players on Colorado's Stanley Cup run last year, said McDavid's season makes him want to get better.“It makes you want to strive for something,” MacKinnon said. ""I know I won’t be as good as him no matter how hard I work, but I appreciate what he’s doing and how he does it.”McDavid envies MacKinnon, Crosby and Ovechkin for what they've done that he has not: won the Cup. Now 26 with a trip to the Western Conference final last season his deepest run so far, he said his focus has always been about the team and called a winning a championship “the ultimate goal — and that’s what we’re building towards.”Nothing McDavid does in the regular season guarantees playoff success, though carrying the Oilers like MacKinnon did with the Avalanche at times last spring could be his next trick. Vegas coach Bruce Cassidy sees evidence of that in McDavid's production now.“Just a dominant guy that wants to get his name on the Cup,” Cassidy said. “He’s just focused on, even though it’s regular season, driving that team, pulling that team, putting them on his back.”On pace for the most points in a season since Mario Lemieux put up 161 in 1995-96, McDavid said he hasn't put much thought into what his scoring total might be. Other players certainly are.“Every time he’s on the ice he could have one or two goals,” said Florida's Sam Reinhart, a teammate of McDavid's on the 2015 championship Canada world junior team.Of course, his name etched on a few more individual trophies won't fill the void for McDavid in his quest for the Cup. He's making Edmonton games appointment viewing and would love for that to continue well into June.“I think everyone’s tuning in to the Oilers games most nights because of how special of a player he is,” Strome said. “Obviously, the next step is winning. He’s doing everything in his power to do that.”___Follow AP Hockey Writer Stephen Whyno on Twitter at https://twitter.com/SWhyno___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/14,,World

                                                                  Skin Lightening Products Market
Market Overview:

Skin lightening refers to a cosmetic procedure to lighten dark spots of the skin or give it a uniformly lighter tone. It is used to reduce the appearance of discolorations such as birthmarks or melanin (melasma). Skin-lightening techniques work by decreasing the melanin content or synthesis. On a doctor’s recommendation, potent skin-lightening creams, which typically contain hydroquinone or corticosteroids (such as hydrocortisone), are available. Market revenue growth will also be driven by the increasing popularity of self-care products for skin care.











            Market revenue is also growing significantly due to increased demand for organic skin-lightener. Organic Skin Lightener is a company that offers skin-lightening products. These products are organic and safe. Organic Skin Lightener offers safe and effective skin-lightening products and skin-whitening supplements that can help you achieve a lighter, more even complexion without causing any skin damage. Glutathione, a natural antioxidant, helps fight off free radicals which, in turn, aids skin whitening, skin health, and minimizing signs of aging.

            Most women begin to pay more attention to their skin and body image after puberty. To have fairer, more beautiful skin, teenage girls are turning to fairness creams and skin-lightening products. Media and marketers are heavily influential in influencing young consumers. They get endorsements from well-known celebrities to promote fair products. A survey found that 71% of women prefer fair-skinned men for marriage. A rising desire for fair skin is expected to drive market revenue growth in the future, as well as increase demand for the skin lightening product.

            The Skin Lightening Products market is experiencing a slowdown in revenue growth due to strict regulations across countries regarding skincare products and growing awareness among consumers about the harmful effects of synthetic products. The majority of fairness creams contain mercury. This can easily penetrate the skin, lower melanin levels, and damage skin cells. It also increases its susceptibility to UV rays. Mercury can lead to serious problems such as skin cancer, muscle loss, osteoporosis, and, in the case of pregnant women harm to the fetus or nervous system.

Hydroponic systems can vary in complexity, but they typically involve placing plant roots in a growing medium such as perlite, vermiculite, or coconut coir, and circulating a nutrient-rich water solution around the roots. This allows plants to absorb nutrients more efficiently than they would from soil, which can result in faster growth and higher yields.Media Filled Growbeds (MFG)

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834002,UK boosts defense spending in response to Russia and China,"LONDON (AP) — U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak pledged Monday to increase military funding by 5 billion pounds ($6 billion) over the next two years in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the “epoch-defining challenge” posed by China.The increase, part of a major update to U.K. foreign and defense policy, is less than military officials wanted. Sunak said the U.K. would increase military spending to 2.5% of gross domestic product “in the longer term,” but didn't set a date. Britain currently spends just over 2% of GDP on defense, and military chiefs want it to rise to 3%.The extra money will be used, in part, to replenish Britain’s ammunition stocks, depleted from supplying Ukraine in its defense against Russia. Some will also go towards a U.K.-U.S.-Australia deal to build nuclear-powered submarines.“The world has become more volatile, the threats to our security have increased,” Sunak told the BBC during a visit to the U.S. “It's important that we protect ourselves against those.”Sunak met U.S. President Joe Biden and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese  in San Diego on Monday to confirm next steps for the military pact, known as AUKUS, struck by the three countries in 2021 amid mounting concern about China’s actions in the Pacific.Under the deal, the U.K. and Australia will build new nuclear-powered, conventionally armed subs from a British design, with U.S. technology and support. Most of the U.K. construction will take place in shipyards at Barrow-in-Furness in northwest England, with the first subs completed by the late 2030s. Australia will also buy up to five Virginia-class subs from the U.S.The three leaders said the submarine plan “elevates all three nations’ industrial capacity to produce and sustain interoperable nuclear-powered submarines for decades to come, expands our individual and collective undersea presence in the Indo-Pacific, and contributes to global security and stability.”Britain last produced a defense, security and foreign policy framework, known as the Integrated Review, in 2021.The government ordered an update in response to an increasingly volatile world. The new report, released Monday, said ""there is a growing prospect that the international security environment will further deteriorate in the coming years, with state threats increasing and diversifying in Europe and beyond.”Moscow's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine upended European security order, and the review said Russia poses “the most acute threat to the U.K.'s security.”The U.K. is also increasingly concerned about what the government calls “the epoch-defining challenge presented by the Chinese Communist Party’s increasingly concerning military, financial and diplomatic activity.”The defense review said that ""wherever the Chinese Communist Party’s actions and stated intent threaten the U.K.’s interests, we will take swift and robust action to protect them.”U.K. intelligence agencies have expressed growing concern about China’s military might, covert activities and economic muscle. Ken McCallum, head of domestic spy agency MI5, said in November that “the activities of the Chinese Communist Party pose the most game-changing strategic challenge to the U.K.” MI5 said in January 2022 that a London-based lawyer had tried to “covertly interfere in U.K. politics” on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party — including by channeling money to an opposition Labour Party lawmaker.Concern about Beijing's activities has sparked a government-wide catch-up campaign on China, including Mandarin-language training for British officials and a push to secure new sources of critical minerals that are essential to technology.The review doesn't brand China itself a threat to the U.K., and Sunak has stressed the need for economic ties with China, to the annoyance of more hawkish members of the governing Conservative Party.“We are sliding towards a new Cold War,"" said Conservative lawmaker Tobias Ellwood, who chairs the House of Commons Defense Committee. “Threats are increasing, but here we are staying on a peacetime budget.”Speaking as he traveled to the U.S., Sunak said China's Communist government “is increasingly authoritarian at home and assertive abroad, and has a desire to reshape the world order.”But, he added, “you can’t ignore China” given the size of its economy.“It’s right to engage with China, on the issues that we can find common ground and make a difference on, for example climate change, global health, macroeconomic stability,” he said.“That’s the right approach whilst being very robust in defending our values and our interests.”",2023/3/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834003,Indicted aide to former Maryland governor misses court date,"ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) — A federal judge issued an arrest warrant on Monday for Roy McGrath, the one-time aide to former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, after McGrath failed to appear in court as his trial on federal fraud charges was set to begin.U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman issued the arrest warrant in U.S. District Court in Baltimore on Monday morning. McGrath had an arraignment scheduled for 9 a.m. in a superseding indictment in his federal case. Jury selection was scheduled to begin Monday morning. The judge ended up excusing the jurors and the case has been postponed, said McGrath's attorney, Joseph Murtha.Murtha said he spoke to McGrath late Sunday afternoon or early evening, and they had “a substantively productive conversation."" Murtha said he anticipated seeing his client at the courthouse at 8:45 a.m. Monday, but McGrath did not arrive.“I have no further information,"" Murtha said in a telephone interview. ""I really do hope that he's safe. I was shocked, quite honestly.”McGrath, who had moved to Naples, Florida, faces an eight-count federal indictment. Charges include wire fraud, including securing a $233,648 severance payment equal to one year of salary as the head of Maryland Environmental Service. He also faces fraud and embezzlement charges connected to roughly $170,000 in expenses. McGrath has pleaded not guilty.McGrath did not return cellphone calls or emails Monday morning.McGrath resigned in August 2020 when he was just 11 weeks into the job as Hogan’s chief of staff, after the payments became public.McGrath was appointed by Hogan to serve as executive director of the environmental agency in December 2016. The corporation owned by the state provides environmental services such as water and wastewater management and other services to state and local government agencies, federal government entities, and private clients.The federal and state charges allege that from March 2019 through December 2020, McGrath personally enriched himself by using his positions of trust as the director and the chief of staff for the governor to get the agency to make payments to himself.The indictment alleges McGrath got the agency’s board to approve paying him a $233,648 severance payment — equal to one year’s salary — upon his departure by falsely telling them the governor was aware of and approved the payment.If convicted of the federal charges, McGrath faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison for each of four counts of wire fraud; and a maximum of 10 years in federal prison for each of two counts of embezzling funds from an organization receiving more than $10,000 in federal benefits.",2023/3/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834004,"Confirmed: Global floods, droughts worsening with warming","The intensity of extreme drought and rainfall has “sharply” increased over the past 20 years, according to a study published Monday in the journal Nature Water. These aren’t merely tough weather events, they are leading to extremes such as crop failure, infrastructure damage, even humanitarian crises and conflict.The big picture on water comes from data from a pair of satellites known as GRACE, or Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment, that were used to measure changes in Earth’s water storage — the sum of all the water on and in the land, including groundwater, surface water, ice, and snow.“It’s incredible that we can now monitor the pulse of continental water from outer space,” said Park Williams, a bioclimatologist at the University of California, Los Angeles who was not involved with the study.“I have a feeling when future generations look back and try to determine when humanity really began understanding the planet as a whole, this will be one of the studies highlighted,"" he said.The researchers say the data confirms that both frequency and intensity of rainfall and droughts are increasing due to burning fossil fuels and other human activity that releases greenhouse gases.“I was surprised to see how well correlated the global intensity was with global mean temperatures,” said Matthew Rodell, study author and deputy director of Earth sciences for hydrosphere, biosphere, and geophysics at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.The strong link between these climate extremes and rising global average temperatures means continued global warming will mean more drought and rainstorms that are worse by many measures — more frequent, more severe, longer and larger.Researchers looked at 1,056 events from 2002-2021 using a novel algorithm that identifies where the land is much wetter or drier than normal.That showed the most extreme rains keep happening in sub-Saharan Africa, at least through December 2021, the end of the data. The rainfall extremes also took place in central and eastern North America from 2018-2021, and Australia during 2011-2012.The most intense droughts were a record-breaking one in northeastern South America from 2015-2016; an event in the Cerrado region of Brazil that began in 2019 and continues; and the ongoing drought in the American Southwest that has caused dangerously low water levels in two of the biggest U.S. reservoirs, Lake Mead and Lake Powell. Those remain low despite heavy rains this year.Drought events outnumbered heavy rain events by 10%. Their geographic extents and how long they lasted were similar.A warmer atmosphere increases the rate at which water evaporates during dry periods. It also holds more water vapor, which fuels heavy rainfall events.The study noted that infrastructure like airports and sewage treatment plants that were designed to withstand once-in-a-100-year events are becoming more challenged as these extremes happen more often and with more intensity.“Looking forward into the future, in terms of managing water resources and flood control, we should be anticipating that the wetter extremes will be wetter and the dry extremes will get drier,” said Richard Seager, a climate scientist at the Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University, who was not involved with the study.Seager said it's a mistake to assume that future wet and dry extremes can be managed the same as in the past because “everything’s going to get amplified on both ends of the dry-wet spectrum.”According to the U.S. National Integrated Drought Information System, 20% of the annual economic losses from extreme weather events in the U.S. are from floods and droughts.A drastic swing between extreme drought and unprecedented flooding, dubbed “weather whiplash,” is becoming common in some regions.Water stress is expected to significantly affect poor, disenfranchised communities as well as ecosystems that have been underfunded and exploited.For example, the United Nations has said that Somalia is experiencing its longest and most severe drought, an event that has caused the deaths of millions of livestock and widespread hunger. Venezuela, a country that has faced years of political and economic crises, resorted to nationwide power cuts during April 2016 as a result of the drought conditions affecting water levels of the Guri Dam.As for solutions, using floodwaters to replenish depleted aquifers and improving the health of agricultural soil so it can absorb water better and store more carbon are just a few methods that could improve water resiliency in a warming world, the study says.——Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834005,Ole Miss hires former Texas coach Chris Beard,"OXFORD, Miss. (AP) — Mississippi has hired Chris Beard as its basketball coach five weeks after his firing from Texas following a domestic violence arrest.The Rebels announced Beard's hiring on Monday and will introduce him Tuesday in a public event at the SBJ Pavilion. Beard is a four-time conference coach of the year and was AP's national coach of the year in 2019.But his two-year tenure at alma mater Texas ended abruptly in January, though felony domestic charges were ultimately dismissed on Feb. 15. A prosecutor said his office determined that the charge of assault by strangulation/suffocation-family violence could not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.Texas suspended Beard after his Dec. 12 arrest and fired him three weeks later when Texas officials told Beard’s attorney he was “unfit” to lead the program. Beard was arrested when his fiancée, Randi Trew, called 911 and told officers that Beard strangled, bit and hit her during a confrontation in his home.She later said that Beard didn’t choke her, and was defending himself, and that she never intended for Beard to be arrested and prosecuted.Beard replaces Kermit Davis, who was ousted on Feb. 24 after going 74-79 in nearly five full seasons.“We thoroughly evaluated a number of outstanding candidates, and there is no doubt Coach Beard is one of the top coaches in the nation,"" said Keith Carter, the school's vice chancellor for athletics. “After conducting due diligence and speaking to a number of individuals on and off the court, it was evident he is the right person to guide our team to greatness.”Beard has led three different programs to the NCAA Tournament since 2016, including an appearance in the 2019 championship game and an Elite Eight run the year before at Texas Tech. He is 237-98 as a head coach and 11-5 in the NCAA Tournament.“I am honored to be joining the Ole Miss family and excited to get started at this great university,” said Beard, who was 29-13 at Texas. “I can’t express how grateful I am to Chancellor (Glenn) Boyce, Keith Carter and the rest of the search committee for their belief in me to lead this program. I am really looking forward to being an active part of the Oxford community.""Beard spent five seasons at Texas Tech, going 112-55 at a program that had endured five losing seasons in the previous six years. The Red Raiders went to their first Elite Eight in his second season and made it to the national championship game in 2019.Beard led Little Rock to a 30-5 record and a Sun Belt Conference title in his lone season, making the second round of the NCAA Tournament.___AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/college-basketball and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834006,"Alabama, Houston top final AP Top 25 ahead of March Madness","The overall No. 1 seed for March Madness is No. 1 in the final AP Top 25, too.Alabama, fresh off an SEC Tournament title to go with its regular-season crown, ascended to the top spot Monday, earning 48 of 61 first-place votes to jump Houston, which lost in the American Athletic Conference final without star guard Marcus Sasser. Alabama also spent a week at No. 1 last month.“We set goals over the summer: regular season, (league) tournament, obviously a national championship,” Crimson Tide guard Jahvon Quinerly said. “I’m going to make sure our guys are ready to go no matter who we match up with.”That will be Texas A&M-Corpus Christi or Southeast Missouri State, who meet in a First Four game Tuesday night. The winner will play the Crimson Tide on Thursday in Birmingham, an hour down the road from their Tuscaloosa campus.The top seed in the South Region, Alabama would face West Virginia or Maryland for a spot in the Sweet 16 with a win.And how sweet that would be for a team that's gone through the ringer: former teammate Darius Miles and another man have been indicted on capital murder charges for a January shooting, an investigator has testified star freshman Brandon Miller was asked by Miles to bring the gun that night and police have also said Jaden Bradley was at the scene.“To beat the teams we had to beat to get here was not easy,” Alabama coach Nate Oats said last week. “So proud of the guys, proud of their effort, proud they were able to get really focused. Got a lot of mental toughness.”Houston still received nine first-place votes and was No. 2 after losing to Memphis in the final of the AAC tourney, where Sasser hurt his groin in the semifinal round. He did not play in the championship and his status will be watched closely leading up to the Cougars' NCAA opener against Northern Kentucky.Purdue, seeded first in the East Region, earned three first-place votes and was third in the AP poll after the regular-season Big Ten champion won its conference tournament, too. Kansas, which expects to have Bill Self back for the NCAA tourney after a medical scare, was fourth after receiving the No. 1 seed in the West.Texas routed the Jayhawks in the finals of the Big 12 Tournament and rounded out the top five.Marquette remained at No. 6 after its Big East tourney title. UCLA earned one first-place vote and was seventh after losing in the Pac-12 Tournament final to Arizona, which was No. 8. Gonzaga and UConn rounded out the top 10.“We have a special team. We’re not going to do what our past teams have done, which was to maybe get caught up in the wallow of losing,” said Huskies coach Dan Hurley, whose team fell to the Golden Eagles in the Big East tourney semifinals. “We’re going to get our minds right very quickly and get ready to make a run next week.”RISING AND FALLINGDuke made the biggest jump in the final poll after beating Virginia for the ACC Tournament title, climbing nine spots to No. 12 — the highest the Blue Devils have been since the third week of the season. First-year coach Jon Scheyer has them seeded fifth in the East in the NCAA Tournament.UCLA, seeded second in the West, fell five spots to No. 7 in the final poll.IN AND OUTMemphis was hardly receiving votes last week, but rolling to the AAC tourney title put Penny Hardaway's crew into the poll for the first time this season at No. 24. Florida Atlantic, the Conference USA regular-season and tourney champ, returned at No. 25 after spending the first four weeks in the poll in school history in January and February.The Tigers and Owls made the AP poll at the expense of Creighton, which was routed by Xavier in the Big East semifinals, and Kentucky, which fell to Vanderbilt in the SEC Tournament quarterfinal round.CONFERENCE WATCHWidely considered the toughest league in the nation, the Big 12 had two teams in the top five and five in the Top 25. The league has seven schools heading to the NCAA Tournament after Oklahoma State was left on the bubble.The SEC, which tied the Big Ten for the most NCAA bids with eight, had four teams in the final Top 25. The Big East and ACC had three apiece, though the Big East had two in the top 10 and the leading ACC team was Duke at No. 12.___ AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834007,"Gun laws, campus policies perplex college sports programs","At Alabama, one of the team's best players allegedly delivered a gun that was used in a fatal shooting. At New Mexico State, a player avoided charges for shooting and killing a student in what he said was self-defense, even though he was carrying a gun in violation of school rules.At Michigan State, sports were suspended after gun violence on campus left three students dead. At LSU, the team's leading wide receiver was arrested, but not charged, for carrying a gun through the French Quarter in New Orleans.The headlines over the past few months illustrate the challenge for athletic departments in determining how gun laws in their states and regulations at their schools should be applied to their programs and communicated to their players. An Associated Press analysis of more than a dozen schools in the NCAA tournaments shows a wide range of policies that govern guns at those schools and uneven efforts to regulate them.“I have no idea,” Michigan State basketball coach Tom Izzo told AP when asked what he should say to players who legally possess a gun. “Whatever the law is, you can’t supersede the law on your team or in your program.”Mississippi State coach Chris Jans, when asked about his own team's gun policy: “That’s a good question. Not sure I know the correct answer to that right now.”The NCAA has no gun policy on its books, calling it a law-enforcement issue. That means rules for sports teams, if they exist, are derived from a mixture of state laws, university policies and, in some cases, supplements to those policies in the student-athlete handbooks. In some instances, coaches implement their own team rules. But as cases across the country have shown — just in the past four months alone — there is confusion, mixed messages and what some perceive as seat-of-the-pants decision-making on issues that can have life-or-death consequences.Marquette coach Shaka Smart said he's been “yelled at by my superiors” over the years when he brings up sensitive topics such as guns to his players. So, he says, he treads lightly on the subject.“Now, should you be driving around with a gun in your glove compartment or whatever?” Smart said. “I’m not passing judgment on anyone anywhere else as it relates to that. But no, our players should not be doing that and I should not be doing that. And so I don’t, and they don’t.”Guns are prohibited in buildings on the Marquette campus in Milwaukee. At Kansas State, concealed weapons are allowed on campus, so long as they are legally owned.“We have to explain to them why we feel like one decision may be, in this moment in time, a little more prudent than another decision in another moment of their life,” K-State coach Jerome Tang said. ""Like, later on in life, if they want to get a license, that’s fine. But right now, in this moment, it may not be as wise for you.”The AP's analysis found that in many instances, school policies differ from state to state, and sometimes from campus to campus within the same state. Most student-athlete handbooks simply reiterate school policy regarding weapons.In Texas, open carry is not allowed at either the University of Houston or at the University of Texas in Austin, the site of a 1966 mass shooting from the clock tower on campus. But concealed carry is allowed in some areas of each campus, the listings of which are available on the school websites.The NCAA bans guns on the premises of its championship events, presumably meaning the Final Four sites — in Dallas (women) and Houston (men) — will be gun free.In Alabama, a state law that went into effect this year made it legal to openly carry a gun without a permit. Still, guns are prohibited on campus. Police say Alabama star Brandon Miller delivered a gun to a teammate and another person who are charged with the Jan. 15 fatal shooting of 23-year-old Jamea Harris.Miller has not been charged with a crime and has continued to play for his team, which is the overall top seed in the tournament that gets into full swing Thursday. But the school's handling of Miller's status in the aftermath of the shooting underscores the confusion over the topic.There was more than a month between the killing and police testimony that Miller had brought the gun to his teammate, Darius Miles, who was removed from the team after he was charged, then later indicted, in Harris' death.“Our role in a criminal investigation is to support law enforcement, not to conduct our own investigation -- and not to interfere with their efforts,"" athletic director Greg Byrne said in an ESPN interview.At New Mexico State, campus officials appeared unprepared to deal with a shooting that resulted in the death of a student from University of New Mexico. NMSU forward Mike Peake said he was acting in self-defense when he shot and killed Brandon Travis last November while the Aggies were on a road trip in Albuquerque.Guns are prohibited on New Mexico State's campus and on school road trips. Still, police say Peake brought the gun with him on the team bus; it took the school 16 days to permanently suspend him from the team after the shooting.“I don't know if it's a rule you talk about with the players, that you can't bring a gun on the bus,” said Rus Bradburd, a former coach and current professor at New Mexico State whose book, “All the Dreams We've Dreamed,” tells the story of gun violence and basketball in Chicago. “But do you need to write that down? It's like, I always wear pants to a faculty meeting, but that's not anywhere in the bylaws. It's sort of understood.”LSU receiver Malik Nabers was disciplined by the school (no specifics were given) but will not miss games next season after being arrested for illegally carrying a weapon on Bourbon Street last month. Had the incident happened on a busy street in Texas, where permits are not required to carry a concealed weapon, he wouldn't have been arrested in the first place.“Are we concerned about guns with the student athletes? Yeah, we are,” an LSU employee familiar with the situation told AP on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject. “There’s a prevalence of guns everywhere right now. It is something we address specifically among a number of other issues.”Last fall at Virginia, the football team canceled the season's final game after a former member of the team, Christopher Darnell Jones Jr., was charged with murdering three players and wounding two students on campus. Authorities later found guns in his dorm room on the campus where, with few exceptions, weapons are not permitted.It illustrated the impossibility of monitoring every student at any campus, and magnified the plight of sports leaders whose programs can be thrust into the spotlight in the aftermath of gun violence.“The violence is right there with drug use and other sorts of things we hope to guide them away from,” said Mike Marlow, the athletic director at Northern Arizona, where guns are not allowed. “You hope that you have the type of culture in place that discourages the behavior, even if there is some legality to it.”___AP Sports Writers Larry Lage, John Marshall, Steve Megargee, Teresa Walker, Jim Vertuno, Brett Martel, Hank Kurz Jr., and Dave Skretta contributed to this report.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/14,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834009,March Madness has international flair for many women's teams,"STORRS, Conn. (AP) — When star guard Paige Bueckers went down with a season-ending knee injury last August, UConn went searching far and wide for a late addition to its roster.The Huskies found one overseas in Inês Bettencourt, a point guard from Portugal’s mid-Atlantic Azores Islands. An assistant coach had noticed her playing at the Division B U18 European Championships.A couple of months later, the Huskies announced the signing of a player they hope will be their next dominant forward: Jana El Alfy, who is 6-foot-4 and from Egypt. She enrolled in January and joined the team but will not play until next season.The Big East champions are headed to the NCAA Tournament as a No. 2 seed with six international players on the roster after having just 10 others since Geno Auriemma began coaching the team in 1985.“There was very little video of them back then,” Auriemma said. “Today, we have video and those kids have video of everything; they see everything. They watch every one of our games and we have a chance to see them during the summer more because there’s more international competitions.”“It’s not the answer to everything,” he added. “But in certain situations it is, for us, the exact right way to go.”It's also a trend across women's college basketball.The NCAA, citing numbers provided by FIBA, said there were 731 international women playing Division I college basketball in 2022, up nearly 350% from 212 in 2012.Pac-12 Tournament champion Washington State, a No. 5 seed, has nine international players on its roster, including all five starters.Johanna Teder, a senior guard from Estonia, said she thinks there is something in the makeup of players willing to go halfway around the world to pursue their dreams that has contributed to her team's success.“It's a big decision,” she said. “Us internationals, we're more experienced and like independent, if that makes sense. So, maturity plays a big role.”South Florida won the American Athletic Conference regular-season title and is a No. 8 seed in the NCAA tourney, with eight international players.USF coach Jose Fernandez has been recruiting heavily overseas for the last two decades. He said he started looking to Europe and elsewhere because his program was having a hard time competing with bigger names in college basketball for top players in the U.S.What he found, he said, is a bunch of very talented kids who were often more emotionally and intellectually prepared for college basketball than their American counterparts.“I don’t think I’ve had an international player ever graduate with less than a 3.5 GPA, which is amazing with English being their second language,” he said. ""There’s also there’s no entitlement, right? A lot of these international recruits they’re not getting two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight pairs of shoes, and four or five different jerseys and, and, and getting treated like American high school prospects are treated as eighth, ninth and 10th graders.""He said he used to see three or four other U.S. college coaches and international competitions but now sees about 40 or 50. El Alfy began getting noticed by U.S. college coaches as a member of her national team, which is coached by her father, while attending camps sponsored by the NBA.“They really helped me a lot with everything, especially with their camps all around the world, not just in Africa,” she said. “I was able to like go to Australia and also be on a different environment and different culture. I got to improve on myself and just getting the experience to be there is just something that I’m grateful for.”The NBA, which has been running its residential NBA Academy for male international players for years, began sponsoring camps for elite international girls in 2018 and has held camps in India, Mexico, Senegal and the U.S.Chris Ebersole, associate vice president of the NBA and head of the league’s Elite Basketball programs, said the idea is to gather the top talent from around the world and expose them to great coaching and opportunities while educating them about their options.“We’ve seen that there’s actually a ton of untapped potential in terms of international women’s basketball, through those Basketball Without Borders camps in Africa, in Europe and Latin America and in Asia,” he said.About 40 players in Division I have come through those camps, he said, including UConn's El Alfy, Nika Mühl (Croatia) and Aaliyah Edwards (Canada).Mühl said the camps helped her make the decision to attend college rather than go straight to professional basketball in Europe.“It gave me a little glimpse of like, what life in America would be, you know, different people from different cultures playing together, which is what we have here,” she said. “But ultimately, the thing that made me come here is UConn itself and coach Geno Auriemma. There’s nothing else like the history and the culture of this place.""Lou Lopez Sénéchal, a Mexican national who grew up in France, spent four years at Fairfield before transferring to UConn for a graduate season.She said for her and other international players, the draw of playing in the United States had a lot to do with being able to stay in school and play with people her own age, rather than going pro and competing against older women.“It comes also from being curious, wanting to travel, wanting to discover a new country, and not just wanting to stay in your own world and kind of like getting out of your comfort zone,"" she said.Fernandez said there are many things that make the U.S. more attractive for international players than playing for a club or professional team closer to home. He noted that “with ESPN+ and everything else,” parents can watch their kids from afar.Dorka Juhász (Hungary), who transferred from Ohio State before the 2021-22 season, said the international students have formed a bond a UConn. The older ones, she said, help the younger ones deal with issues that arise, such as homesickness, doing taxes, visas and how to get celebrity endorsement deals without jeopardizing their status.“It's good to have somebody to rely on and you’re not the only one,” she said. “It’s also good to see that UConn loves international players. Just seeing so many other faces that are here from different countries, and how they’re loving it here. I think that’s just showing how much they care about us here.""___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834010,"New England, upstate New York, bracing for winter storm","Parts of the Northeast were bracing for a powerful winter storm that could dump heavy, wet snow and unleash strong winds, making travel difficult and knocking out power to hundreds of thousands of people.The National Weather Service says the storm could begin late Monday and last into Wednesday. Areas in its path could include parts of New England, upstate New York, northeastern Pennsylvania, and northern New Jersey, with snowfall totals expected to range from a few inches to a few feet, depending on the area.“This could be deadly,” New York Gov. Kathy Hochul warned at a storm briefing in Albany. “Let me repeat: This will be a dangerous storm. Please stay off the roads for your own safety.”Higher elevations in New York's mid-Hudson region and the Albany area could receive 3 feet (91 centimeter) of snow.Hochul, who will issue a state of emergency starting at 8 p.m. Monday, said snow plow crews from Long Island and utility crews as far away as Canada were being sent to the region. She also said 100 National Guard members were brought in to assist with emergency response.Snow in the western part of Massachusetts could exceed 18 inches (45 centimeters), but along the coast, the totals could be 3 or 4 inches (7.5 centimeters to 10 centimeters), Bill Simpson, a spokesman for the National Weather Service in Norton, Massachusetts, said.""I'm not quite sure of the exact track,"" Simpson said. “That makes all the difference in the world.”A winter storm warning was due to take effect Monday evening and last through Wednesday morning for parts of upstate New York, northeastern Pennsylvania, northern New Jersey, southern sections of Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont as well as western Massachusetts and parts of Connecticut and Rhode Island.Some schools in the region canceled classes for Tuesday ahead of the storm, and Maine Gov. Janet Mills directed that all state offices be closed Tuesday.Connecticut’s largest electricity provider, Eversource, was bringing in extra crews from other states as it prepared for up to 130,000 power outages.“That combination of heavy wet snow, long duration of sustained winds, long duration of gusts will almost certainly bring down tree limbs and entire trees,” said Steve Sullivan, president of Connecticut electric operations for Eversource. “Those will damage the electric system.”In New Hampshire, the storm will hit on Election Day for town officeholders. Dozens of communities postponed voting, while others reminded voters that they could vote by absentee ballot on Monday instead.Similar back-to-back Election Day storms in 2017 and 2018 sparked widespread confusion about who could reschedule elections.Lawmakers have since changed the law to allow town moderators to postpone elections if the National Weather Service issues a storm warning. For Tuesday, such warnings have been issued for at least parts of seven of the state’s 10 counties.In Massachusetts, Gov. Maura Healey directed all non-emergency state employees working in executive branch agencies not to report to their workplaces Tuesday, and instead work from home if possible.The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority suspended all ferry service Tuesday.Boston Mayor Michelle Wu said city officials were keeping a close eye on the storm, which was expected to start out as mostly rain Tuesday along the eastern coast of Massachusetts.“The weather forecasts are still shifting around quite a bit,” Wu said. “Our public works and emergency management and Boston Public Schools teams are really focused on tracking this minute by minute.”Wu said the city has been in touch with companies that might be running cranes or large construction sites make sure they secure materials ahead of predicted strong winds.___AP reporters Holly Ramer in Concord, New Hampshire, David Collins in Hartford, Connecticut, Steve LeBlanc in Boston and Maysoon Khan in Albany, New York contributed to this report.",2023/3/14,,World

(AP) — Two men caught shoplifting at a grocery store in Georgia had an estimated $26,000 worth of baby formula in their car, according to police.Police in Cartersville caught the men walking out of a Publix store north of Atlanta with backpacks filled with cans of formula, news outlets reported. Officers searching their car found 662 more cans of formula inside, police Lt. Greg Sparacio said.“We believe right now that they have hit several locations, Publix, Kroger, Walmart and more in just over a course of a couple of days,” Sparacio said.The men were jailed in Bartow County on charges of shoplifting, felony theft by receiving, and contributing to the delinquency of a minor. They had a 16-year-old girl with them when they were arrested Thursday. It was not immediately known if the men had attorneys representing them.The February 2021 shutdown of a large baby formula factory and recall of many of its products because of contamination concerns helped trigger a nationwide formula shortage.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834012,"March Madness: Norse ride again, a KU deja vu for Howard","LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) — Northern Kentucky coach Darrin Horn might be looking forward to his team’s NCAA Tournament appearance even more than his players.The Norse won their fourth Horizon League championship since 2016-17 but will play in March Madness for the first time since 2019. They also won the league title in 2020, but there was no NCAA Tournament that year because of the COVID-19 pandemic.That denied Horn a chance to lead his first NKU squad in the Big Dance, which makes this berth a bit more special. Especially after the Norse let an opportunity slip away in last year's Horizon Tournament.“We kind of feel like we had one taken from us literally, where you qualify for the tournament and then the tournament just doesn’t happen,” Horn said in a phone interview. “So, to finally punch your ticket and know that there’s going to be games and you’re going to be a part of the process, that’s really exciting.”The No. 16 seed Norse (22-12) will face Midwest top seed Houston on Thursday night in Birmingham, Alabama. NKU features the nation’s No. 27 defense (63.6 points allowed per game) and the No. 42 scorer in junior guard Marques Warrick (19.1 points).DEJA VUHoward’s last NCAA Tournament appearance in 1992 was a 100-67 loss to Midwest top seed Kansas. Back then, Kenneth Blakeney was a 20-year-old Duke sophomore on a Blue Devils squad that repeated as national champions.Blakeney now coaches Howard and will lead the No. 16 seed Bison (22-12) against the defending national champion and top-seeded Jayhawks again, this time in a West Region first-round game. Howard topped Norfolk State 65-64 for the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference Tournament championship, capping a remarkable turnaround from 4-29 in Blakeney’s debut season in 2019-20 to their first regular-season and tournament titles since that last trip to the Big Dance.“To represent Howard University is a big honor for me,"" said Blakeney, a Washington, D.C., native, via email. ""I'm humble to be a mentor at a great university. Kansas is a national, traditional and historic program. I’m excited.”The D.C. school is one of two historically Black colleges and universities in the tournament. Texas Southern won the Southwestern Athletic Conference title and will face Fairleigh Dickinson in a matchup of No. 16 seeds in the First Four in Dayton, Ohio.CHARMED EXISTENCEIt’s been quite a year for West Virginia coach Bob Huggins.Huggins was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in September. He became the winningest active Division I coach last week when Jim Boeheim retired at Syracuse.The Mountaineers (19-14) overcame a horrible start to Big 12 play to reach the NCAA Tournament field as a No. 9 seed. They’ll meet No. 8 seed and state line rival Maryland (21-12) on Thursday in Birmingham, Alabama.“I never had any doubt that we wouldn’t play in the tournament,” Huggins said Sunday night. “I thought we were getting better and better.”West Virginia lost its first five Big 12 games but rebounded to finish 7-11 in arguably the nation's toughest league. The NCAA bid wouldn’t have been secured without three wins in the Mountaineers' final four regular-season games, including over Iowa State and No. 12 Kansas State.“I’m good with it,” Huggins said. “Obviously we wanted to win more games. We just had some things happen.”RECONNECTINGMarquette’s first-round East Region matchup Friday against Vermont gave Golden Eagles guard and Big East player of the year Tyler Kolek a chance to catch up with an old friend.Kolek began his college career at George Mason while playing for a coaching staff that included Bryson Johnson, who is now a Vermont assistant. As soon as the matchup of No. 2 and No. 15 seeds was announced, Kolek and Johnson began exchanging texts.“We had some competitive fire going back and forth,” Kolek said. “We’d always shoot against each other (at George Mason). He actually played at Bucknell and he was a pretty good player. Just a little trash talk.”Marquette beat Xavier 65-51 on Saturday to earn its first Big East Conference title.STAYING HOMENo. 1 overall seed Alabama and archrival Auburn, the Midwest No. 9 seed, won’t have to go far for their tournament debuts.Both schools will open in Birmingham, Alabama, a 58-mile hop from Tuscaloosa for the Crimson Tide, who on Thursday will face the winner of the No. 16 seed matchup between Texas A&M-Corpus Christi and Southeast Missouri State.The Tigers will travel about 110 miles for their first-round meeting with No. 8 seed Iowa, where Auburn coach Bruce Pearl was an assistant from 1986-92.___AP Sports Writers Mike Marot, Steve Megargee, John Raby and Stephen Whyno contributed to this report.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834013,Macron faces crucial test amid anger over his pension plan,"PARIS (AP) — President Emmanuel Macron is facing a crucial test this week as the battle over his unpopular plan to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64 is set to reach a peak in the streets and at parliament, deepening a widely shared feeling that he doesn't hear the grievances of the French.The 45-year-old pro-business centrist has put his legacy on the line with his pension reform plans, central to his vision for making the French economy more competitive. But he may have to force it through parliament, which would damage his democratic credentials and further enrage those who are opposing it.France's trade unions have called for an eighth round of nationwide protests on Wednesday. On the same day, the bill heads to a committee of seven senators and seven lower-house lawmakers as part of the complex legislative process. Open-ended strikes have been disrupting some refineries, train traffic across the country and garbage collection in Paris.In a letter last week to unions, Macron reiterated his views, insisting on the need for raising the retirement age in order to make the French pension system financially sustainable in the coming years.If the parliamentary committee reaches an accord on Wednesday, the text is expected to be submitted to a vote in both the Senate and the National Assembly the next day. However, the outcome in the lower house, where Macron’s centrist alliance lost its majority last year, is hard to predict.If the government considers the risk too high that the bill would be rejected, it could use a special constitutional power that would force the pension reform through without a vote.According to political analyst Brice Teinturier, deputy director-general of the Ipsos polling institute, such a move “would appear as brutal and would increase people’s sense that it is an unfair measure imposed from above.”The government acknowledged a vote is the favored option, because it would provide more legitimacy to the pension plan.Opinion polls show that a majority of people oppose the reform, and at the same time that they “have in mind the idea that ... Macron will pass his law, whatever it costs,"" Teinturier stressed. “Yet it doesn’t mean that they are resigned … The resentment and anger remain intact.""The use of the constitutional power would trigger a no-confidence motion. In a scenario that appears unlikely at this stage, but has been raised by some government officials, it could ultimately lead Macron to dissolve the National Assembly and call new legislative elections.Macron “considers — rightly or wrongly — that if he doesn’t do that reform, he won’t be able to do any reform anymore,” Teinturier said.The French president has pushed his economic agenda through since he was first elected in 2017 on a promise to make the country's economy more competitive, including by making people work longer. He made the pension reform a flagship of his second — and final — term after his reelection last year.Changes he made in previous years include making it easier to hire and fire workers, cutting business taxes and making it more difficult for the unemployed to claim benefits.The government plans to present a bill in the coming months aimed at bringing the unemployment rate down to around 5% — one of Macron’s commitments. France unemployment rate recently reached 7.2%, its lowest rate since 2008.Macron and government officials are mindful of the yellow vest protests, when violent riots broke out at the end of 2018 and later turned into a broader denunciation of social injustice.The situation appears different this year, with unions jointly organizing the protest movement in largely peaceful demonstrations.Unions have vowed to further increase the pressure on the government. Yet they have stopped short, until now, to call for an open-ended general strike.French economist Thomas Piketty strongly criticized the pension plan, saying it ""simply aims to raise money, without any objective of universality or simplification.”“The urgent need is for investment in education and health and the establishment of a fairer economic system, in France and in Europe, and even more so on an international scale. But the government continues to pursue an anti-social policy from another age,” he wrote in a column published Saturday in Le Monde newspaper.All French retirees receive a state pension. The system is projected to go into deficit in the coming decade as France’s population ages.Leftist lawmakers argue companies and the wealthy should pitch in more to finance the pension system.The chief economist at Oxford Economics France, Daniela Ordonez, noted that other European countries are facing similar issues.“Currently, the minimum age at which you could retire in Germany, Belgium, Spain and the United Kingdom is 65 and it is already in the law … that this age will increase over the years up to 67, for example, in Germany and in Spain,"" she stressed.",2023/3/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834014,De Bruyne urged to focus on 'simple things' amid dip in form,"Kevin De Bruyne has long been one of the untouchables at Manchester City.Being benched for three of the team’s last seven Premier League games suggests that might no longer be the case.City manager Pep Guardiola thinks De Bruyne — European soccer’s assist king — needs to focus on the “simple things” to get back to his best. They’ll both hope that starts Tuesday against Leipzig in the second leg of their last-16 matchup in the Champions League, with the score at 1-1 after the first game three weeks ago.“I’m not going to discover Kevin. Kevin has an ability to do it. What I’d like — I spoke many times to him — is to go to the easy principles and do it well,” Guardiola said in a news conference Monday.“He has an incredible ability to make an assist, to score goals and see passes like no one else, but I always have belief they will increase and will get better when (he does) the simple things, like don’t lose the ball, the mobility, the incredible capacity to be active in the movement, to do it again better and better.”De Bruyne has still made 17 assists in 34 appearances for City this season, setting up more goals in the Premier League — 12 — than any other player.The Belgium midfielder had an underwhelming World Cup, when his country failed to advance to the knockout stage in Qatar. And his radar has been off in recent weeks, during which he has given the ball away more than he normally does and struggled to connect with prolific City striker Erling Haaland.City’s players are still getting used to having a central striker to feed, having played without one last season, though De Bruyne believes there are reasons why Haaland isn’t perhaps having as much joy as in the first half of this campaign.“I would say people are maybe more anticipating to his runs,” De Bruyne said of Haaland, who has a Premier League-high 28 goals this season — and 34 goals in 34 appearances in all competitions. “But there’s always a first part of the season and a second part. I feel in the second part, there’s a lot more going on. Teams are more well-organized, they are playing for more, also — on both sides of the table.“So I feel people are more prepared in every sense. Maybe he was a little more prolific when he got the chances but I don’t think we need to complain about the output of Erling in any way. I think he’s fine.”At 31, De Bruyne has said he is “an old man in this game” but doesn’t think it’s quite the time to adapt his style, potentially dropping deeper in midfield.“I’m a perfectionist,” he said. “Whatever I do in football or life, I will always want it to be 100%. In that regard, if the time would come, that is something I would think about but it’s not necessarily now.“If I think about it at this particular time, I would like to stay as high as possible, for as long as possible, but that isn’t only my decision.”City, the dominant team in England for the past decade, is looking to reach the quarterfinals for the sixth straight season but has never won European soccer's biggest prize. The team's only appearance in the final came in 2021, when it lost 1-0 to Chelsea in Porto.De Bruyne knows the “noise” will get bigger around City in the competition the longer the team backed by Abu Dhabi wealth goes without winning it.“We've not won it but I feel we've done really well in the Champions League,” he said. ""I know people base everything on only winning but I feel there's been a lot of circumstances in these types of games.“Obviously I want to win it, but I know as long as we don't, I will get the same question. And I'm fine that people judge you on that.”Leipzig is coming off a 3-0 win over Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday, a game that saw Spain midfielder Dani Olmo come off the bench for his first appearance since January after a leg injury. France striker Christopher Nkunku is likely to miss out with a thigh muscle injury.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/14,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834020,Falcons sign guard Chris Lindstrom to 5-year extension,"FLOWERY BRANCH, Ga. (AP) — The Atlanta Falcons announced Monday that Pro Bowler Chris Lindstrom has signed a five-year contract extension, reportedly making him the NFL's highest-paid guard.ESPN reported the deal, which will keep Lindstrom with the Falcons through the 2028 season, is worth $105 million. It locks up another key member of the offensive line, with left tackle Jake Matthews under contract through 2026.Lindstrom's average of $21 million per season surpasses Indianapolis guard Quenton Nelson’s $20.2 million annual average, according to ESPN.The 26-year-old Lindstrom was Atlanta’s top pick in 2019 out of Boston College. He has started 55 games over his four-year career, only missing time when he went down with a broken foot as a rookie.Lindstrom was selected to his first Pro Bowl this past season after starting all 17 games at right guard and anchoring a line that opened up holes for the third-best rushing attack in the NFL. The Falcons averaged 159.9 yards per game on the ground.Pro Football Focus said Lindstrom led all offensive players with a 95.0 grade. He was PFF's top-graded offensive lineman during four weeks this past season.Lindstrom has been called for only one holding penalty in his career.The contract extension for Lindstrom is expected to be part of a big spending spree by the Falcons, who went into free agency with roughly $50 million of cap space.Atlanta is looking to make a big move in 2023 after five straight losing seasons.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/3/14,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834025,A look at the latest scandal involving Barcelona,"MADRID (AP) — Spanish soccer was rocked last month when it became public that Barcelona has paid millions of euros to possibly benefit from refereeing decisions for more than a decade.Barcelona was paying a company that belonged to the vice president of the country’s refereeing committee.The club has denied wrongdoing but is being widely criticized across Spain, and prosecutors on Friday formally accused the club of corruption.Here’s a look at the latest scandal involving Barcelona, which surfaced as the club is still trying to recover from one of its worse financial crises and the departure of Lionel Messi.WHAT HAPPENED?Prosecutors say Barcelona paid as much as 7.3 million euros ($7.7 million) from 2001-18 to the company of committee vice president José María Enríquez Negreira in amounts ""not justified because they were not foreseen in the statutes of the club nor approved by its general assembly (of club members).”The payments were allegedly made in exchange for technical reports on referees and youth players, though apparently in amounts above market prices.Getting reports on referees is common practice and clubs can pay other companies or have them prepared internally, as Barcelona now does. But giving large amounts of money to the company of a person involved in the running of Spain’s referees for the reports is not a normal practice.The payments were probed as part of a tax investigation into the company of Enríquez Negreira, a former referee who was on the Spanish Football Federation refereeing committee from 1994-2018, when the payments stopped. The committee is in charge, among other things, of choosing referees for each match.There is so far no evidence that referees or game results were actually influenced during the period in which Barcelona made the payments.FORMAL ACCUSATIONProsecutors accused Barcelona of alleged corruption in sports, fraudulent management, and falsification of mercantile documentation.The accusations are against Barcelona itself, Enríquez Negreira, former Barcelona presidents Sandro Rosell and Josep Maria Bartomeu, and former Barcelona executives Óscar Grau and Albert Soler.Prosecutors said there was enough evidence to believe that Rosell and Bartomeu, who ran Barcelona in consecutive terms from 2010-20, “reached a confidential, verbal agreement” with Enríquez Negreira, who, “in exchange for money, was to carry out acts tending to favor Barcelona Football Club in the decision-making process of referees in the games played by Barcelona, and in the results of the competitions.”Barcelona paid Enríquez Negreira’s company during different club presidents, including from 2003-10 under the first term of current president Joan Laporta, who again took charge in 2021. Laporta, however, is not being accused by the prosecutors and has denied any wrongdoing. WHAT BARCELONA SAYSThe club has denied wrongdoing or conflict of interest. It has acknowledged the regular payments to Enríquez Negreira’s company but said they were for only technical reports, not to try to influence refereeing decisions.Barcelona has yet to fully explain its relationship with Enríquez Negreira. The club said it hired an independent firm to carry out its own investigation and is expected to give a more detailed account of what happened when that is concluded.President Laporta said, “Barça is innocent of the accusations made against it and is the victim of a campaign, that now involves everyone, to harm its honorability.”Enríquez Negreira told Cadena SER radio he never favored Barcelona while assigning referees to matches, and his job was to only aid the club verbally about how players should conduct themselves before each referee.Bartomeu also denied wrongdoing and told ABC newspaper Enríquez Negreira had “zero power over referees.”Barcelona coach Xavi said the matter was not affecting his players. The team was eliminated from the Europa League but remained in the semifinals of the Copa del Rey and in the lead of the Spanish league.THE ACCUSERSThe Spanish league, the country’s soccer federation and most clubs expressed their concern and intent to take action against Barcelona. They said the matter was damaging the reputation of Spanish soccer and sports in general.Spanish league president Javier Tebas said Laporta should resign if he can’t properly explain the payments.“I think this is the worst moment in Spanish soccer,” Tebas told Movistar on Monday. “It's embarrassing that we still don't have a convincing explanation by Barcelona.”Madrid called for an urgent board meeting on Sunday and expressed its “utmost concern regarding the gravity of the facts” involving Barcelona. It said it would side against the rival in the legal proceeding to defend its “legitimate rights” as an “affected party"" in the matter.The Spanish government’s top sports authority also said it planned to take action. José Manuel Franco, president of Spain’s sports council, said on Monday on channel Telecinco, the government will join the other accusing parties in the legal proceedings. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez weighed in on the case, saying the government was waiting for the matter to be clarified.The Spanish federation noted that Enríquez Negreira left the committee after the new administration took over in 2018.Spain’s referees came out to publicly distance themselves from the relationship between Barcelona and Enríquez Negreira. Many former referees who were active at the time Enríquez Negreira was their vice president said they never received any pressure from him or other officials.WHAT’S NEXT?An investigating judge will decide whether the accusations filed by the prosecutors should lead to charges.Sporting sanctions against Barcelona were not considered initially because the statute of limitations on the possible irregularities had expired, but if the club is eventually convicted, it could possibly lead to a ban from competitions.There was no immediate timetable on the next steps by the courts.___Tales Azzoni on Twitter: http://twitter.com/tazzoni___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/14,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834028,EU-Malaysia relations at risk over colonial legacy claims,"A multibillion-dollar lawsuit between the heirs of a historic sultanate and the Malaysian government over land awards signed during the era of British imperialism, threatens to further cloud European relations with the Southeast Asian country.Malaysia already accuses the European Union of infringing upon its sovereignty through environmental policies that will ban imports of palm oil, one of its main agricultural goods, in a case that the World Trade Organization (WTO) is expected to rule on this year.Kuala Lumpur claims this is mere protectionism from Brussels, while Malaysia's former minister of Plantation Industries and Commodities, Zuraida Kamaruddin, called the EU's policy ""crop apartheid.""Despite attempts to kickstart negotiations on a free-trade agreement, relations could be muddied further amid the potential confiscation of Malaysian-owned property in Europe over a 19th century land dispute.Last year, a French arbitration court ordered the Malaysian government to pay around €15 billion ($16 billion) to the descendants of the Sulu sultanate over an 1878 land deal, although that order has now been put on hold. Earlier this month, Malaysian officials in Paris were able to prevent French authorities from confiscating several properties in the French capital.""These jurisdictions, for example, Spain, Luxembourg, France… We want their governments to respect our government… How can a commercial arbitrator come and question our sovereignty?"" Malaysia's law minister, Azalina Othman Said, said in a parliamentary speech earlier this month.Europe's colonial legacy ""has become an important obstacle in the EU's efforts to upgrade relations with African nations,"" noted Shada Islam, a Brussels-based specialist on European Union affairs. But, so far, it hasn't been such an important topic of opprobrium in Southeast Asia.""References to colonial practices are sometimes made in reference to what Southeast Asian nations view as the EU's restrictive trade policies, especially as regards palm oil, but these are largely in off-the-record comments, not in official discourses,"" she added.But the colonial legacy still lingers. Josep Borrell, the EU's foreign policy chief, was forced to apologize after his remarks last year in which he described Europe as an idyllic ""garden"" and the rest of the world as mostly a ""jungle.""""Some have misinterpreted the metaphor as 'colonial Euro-centrism,'"" Borrell wrote in a blog post in October. ""I am sorry if some have felt offended.""What is now Malaysia gained its independence from Britain in 1957, while all Southeast Asian nations except Thailand were at one point colonized by a European power. Many also underwent Japanese occupation in the 1940s, and the Philippines was once a colony of the United States.Eight descendants of the Sulu sultanate, funded by a London-based investor, have filed applications in multiple arbitration courts across Europe.The claimants argue Kuala Lumpur has reneged on a land deal made in 1878 between Jamalul Kiram II, the last Sultan of Sulu, and the British North Borneo Company, a trading company, over the use of land that is now part of the Malaysian state of Sabah.After it gained independence, Malaysia paid the heirs a token sum for decades but broke off those payments in 2013 after a self-proclaimed descendant of Jamalul Kiram II invaded the Lahad Datu district, in Sabah, with around 200 militants from nearby Philippines.Last year, a French arbitration court ordered the Malaysian government to pay the $15 billion to the Sulu claimants. But Malaysia — which did not participate in the original arbitration as it claims the process an illegal land grab — obtained a stay on the ruling while it pursues an appeal. A decision could come as early as June.The Sulu heirs are also trying to obtain seizure orders against Malaysia-owned property from other European courts. On March 7, French bailiffs attempted to enforce a seizure order on three Paris properties owned by the Malaysian government, but they were turned away by officials at the Malaysian embassy in Paris, Reuters reported.It is thought that this was in relation to a debt of €2.3 million awarded to the heirs by an earlier preliminary arbitration award in Spain. The French authorities are now evaluating whether those three properties, which are reportedly not diplomatic premises, can be seized. According to the UN convention on arbitration, all state assets aside from diplomatic property can be seized after such an arbitration ruling abroad.The Sulu heirs claim their side is the one fighting the ""anti-imperialist"" battle. They purport to be the victims battling for ""justice"" for those ""dispossessed"" by Western imperialism, according to statements from their lawyers.But the Malaysian government also sees it through anti-colonial eyes: European courts are threatening to breach its sovereignty to appropriate billions of dollars of its wealth.According to Rahul Mishra, a senior lecturer at the Asia-Europe Institute of University of Malaya in Kuala Lumpur, the focus of the Malaysian government is ""still on Sulu heirs and not the European courts of law, which should be beneficial for the EU in not getting dragged into a controversy.""But that could change once those courts give their final arbitration rulings, and if Malaysia-owned property is confiscated by European bailiffs.Europe's colonial legacy could also become more prominent in relations as ""calls for climate justice and the decolonization movement gather momentum in the Global South and in academic circles in Europe,"" said Islam, the analyst.The EU's reputation in Southeast Asia has improved in recent years, and Brussels is the preferred ""third party"" that Southeast Asian nations want to engage with amid fractious US-China superpower rivalry in the region, according to the State of Southeast Asia 2023 survey report published last month. Some 43% of the region's respondents preferred the EU as an alternative partner, well ahead of Japan, the UK and India.""As a history graduate, I am acutely aware of the long-lasting impact of colonialism on societies across all continents and it is a shameful part of history,"" Igor Driesmans, the EU ambassador to ASEAN, told DW.""We should not, however, confuse these reprehensible acts undertaken by a limited number of countries in the past with those undertaken by the European Union and its 27 member states in present times,"" he added.""Aside from the fact that the majority of our member states have never participated in any colonial venture, I believe that the founding principles and documents of the European Union are the exact opposite of any systematic exploitation.""Edited by: Srinivas Mazumdaru",2023/3/13,104,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834039,South Carolina women cap wire-to-wire No. 1 run in AP Top 25,"South Carolina joined an exclusive group Monday, going wire-to-wire as No. 1 in consecutive years in The Associated Press Top 25 women's basketball poll.The defending national champion Gamecocks (32-0) became the third school to be the top team in the poll for the entire season in back-to-back years, equaling UConn and Louisiana Tech.The Gamecocks, who are the No. 1 overall seed in the NCAA Tournament, have been atop the poll for 38 straight weeks, which is the second longest run behind UConn's record 51-week streak (2008-10). Led by Aliyah Boston, the Gamecocks were once again a unanimous choice by the 28-member media panel.“We have the best player in college basketball that puts our program in a position to be number one in consecutive seasons,” South Carolina coach Dawn Staley said.Indiana switched places with Iowa in the final poll, moving back up to second after landing its first No. 1 seed in an NCAA tourney. Virginia Tech and Stanford, the other two top seeds, were fourth and fifth in the final Top 25.UConn, which won the Big East Tournament last week, switched places with Maryland to follow the Cardinal. It's the first time since 2006 that the Huskies didn't finish the season in the top five in the poll. They have been in the top 10 in the final poll every year since 1994.Utah, LSU and Villanova rounded out the top 10 teams.HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVELouisiana Tech had its 36-week run at No. 1 from 1980-82 while UConn's was from 2008-10. The Huskies have gone wire-to-wire five other times. Texas (1985-86), Tennessee (1997-98) and Baylor (2011-12) are the only other teams to go one full season at No. 1.JUMPING BACK INIowa State ran through the Big 12 Tournament, winning three games in three days to re-enter the poll at No. 17.“These are moments they’re going to remember,” Iowa State coach Bill Fennelly said. “It’s not just winning. They’ll remember what this environment was like their whole life. We beat a great team, and it was a great three days for us.”Middle Tennessee fell out of the rankings.CONFERENCE SUPREMECYThe Pac-12 finished the season with six teams in the Top 25, the most of any conference. The Big Ten was next with five while the ACC had four. The Big 12 and SEC each had three and the Big East two.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834040,"After two historic US bank failures, here’s what comes next","WASHINGTON (AP) — Two large banks that cater to the tech industry have collapsed after a bank run, government agencies are taking emergency measures to backstop the financial system, and President Joe Biden is reassuring Americans that the money they have in banks is safe.It's all eerily reminiscent of the financial meltdown that began with the bursting of the housing bubble 15 years ago. Yet the initial pace this time around seems even faster.Over the last three days, the U.S. seized the two financial institutions after a bank run on Silicon Valley Bank, based in Santa Clara, California. It was the largest bank failure since Washington Mutual went under in 2008.How did we get here? And will the steps the government unveiled over the weekend be enough?Here are some questions and answers about what has happened and why it matters:WHY DID SILICON VALLEY BANK FAIL?Silicon Valley Bank had already been hit hard by a rough patch for technology companies in recent months and the Federal Reserve’s aggressive plan to increase interest rates to combat inflation compounded its problems.The bank held billions of dollars worth of Treasuries and other bonds, which is typical for most banks as they are considered safe investments. However, the value of previously issued bonds has begun to fall because they pay lower interest rates than comparable bonds issued in today’s higher interest rate environment.That's usually not an issue either because bonds are considered long term investments and banks are not required to book declining values until they are sold. Such bonds are not sold for a loss unless there is an emergency and the bank needs cash.Silicon Valley, the bank that collapsed Friday, had an emergency. Its customers were largely startups and other tech-centric companies that needed more cash over the past year, so they began withdrawing their deposits. That forced the bank to sell a chunk of its bonds at a steep loss, and the pace of those withdrawals accelerated as word spread, effectively rendering Silicon Valley Bank insolvent.WHAT DID THE GOVERNMENT DO SUNDAY?The Federal Reserve, the U.S. Treasury Department, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation decided to guarantee all deposits at Silicon Valley Bank, as well as at New York's Signature Bank, which was seized on Sunday. Critically, they agreed to guarantee all deposits, above and beyond the limit on insured deposits of $250,000.Many of Silicon Valley's startup tech customers and venture capitalists had far more than $250,000 at the bank. As a result, as much as 90% of Silicon Valley's deposits were uninsured. Without the government's decision to backstop them all, many companies would have lost funds needed to meet payroll, pay bills, and keep the lights on.The goal of the expanded guarantees is to avert bank runs — where customers rush to remove their money — by establishing the Fed’s commitment to protecting the deposits of businesses and individuals and calming nerves after a harrowing few days.Also late Sunday, the Federal Reserve initiated a broad emergency lending program intended to shore up confidence in the nation’s financial system.Banks will be allowed to borrow money straight from the Fed in order to cover any potential rush of customer withdrawals without being forced into the type of money-losing bond sales that would threaten their financial stability. Such fire sales are what caused Silicon Valley Bank's collapse.If all works as planned, the emergency lending program may not actually have to lend much money. Rather, it will reassure the public that the Fed will cover their deposits and that it is willing to lend big to do so. There is no cap on the amount that banks can borrow, other than their ability to provide collateral.HOW IS THE PROGRAM INTENDED TO WORK?Unlike its more byzantine efforts to rescue the banking system during the financial crisis of 2007-08, the Fed's approach this time is relatively straightforward. It has set up a new lending facility with the bureaucratic moniker, “Bank Term Funding Program.”The program will provide loans to banks, credit unions, and other financial institutions for up to a year. The banks are being asked to post Treasuries and other government-backed bonds as collateral.The Fed is being generous in its terms: It will charge a relatively low interest rate — just 0.1 percentage points higher than market rates — and it will lend against the face value of the bonds, rather than the market value. Lending against the face value of bonds is a key provision that will allow banks to borrow more money because the value of those bonds, at least on paper, has fallen as interest rates have moved higher.As of the end of last year U.S. banks held Treasuries and other securities with about $620 billion of unrealized losses, according to the FDIC. That means they would take huge losses if forced to sell those securities to cover a rush of withdrawals.HOW DID THE BANKS END UP WITH SUCH BIG LOSSES?Ironically, a big chunk of that $620 billion in unrealized losses can be tied to the Federal Reserve's own interest-rate policies over the past year.In its fight to cool the economy and bring down inflation, the Fed has rapidly pushed up its benchmark interest rate from nearly zero to about 4.6%. That has indirectly lifted the yield, or interest paid, on a range of government bonds, particularly two-year Treasuries, which topped 5% until the end of last week.When new bonds arrive with higher interest rates, it makes existing bonds with lower yields much less valuable if they must be sold. Banks are not forced to recognize such losses on their books until they sell those assets, which Silicon Valley was forced to do.HOW IMPORTANT ARE THE GOVERNMENT GUARANTEES?They're very important. Legally, the FDIC is required to pursue the cheapest route when winding down a bank. In the case of Silicon Valley or Signature, that would have meant sticking to rules on the books, meaning that only the first $250,000 in depositors' accounts would be covered.Going beyond the $250,000 cap required a decision that the failure of the two banks posed a “systemic risk."" The Fed's six-member board unanimously reached that conclusion. The FDIC and the Treasury Secretary went along with the decision as well.WILL THESE PROGRAMS SPEND TAXPAYER DOLLARS?The U.S. says that guaranteeing the deposits won't require any taxpayer funds. Instead, any losses from the FDIC's insurance fund would be replenished by a levying an additional fee on banks.Yet Krishna Guha, an analyst with the investment bank Evercore ISI, said that political opponents will argue that the higher FDIC fees will “ultimately fall on small banks and Main Street business.” That, in theory, could cost consumers and businesses in the long run.WILL IT ALL WORK?Guha and other analysts say that the government's response is expansive and should stabilize the banking system, though share prices for medium-sized banks, similar to Silicon Valley and Signature, plunged Monday.“We think the double-barreled bazooka should be enough to quell potential runs at other regional banks and restore relative stability in the days ahead,” Guha wrote in a note to clients.Paul Ashworth, an economist at Capital Economics, said the Fed's lending program means banks should be able to ""ride out the storm.”“These are strong moves,” he said.Yet Ashworth also added a note of caution: “Rationally, this should be enough to stop any contagion from spreading and taking down more banks ... but contagion has always been more about irrational fear, so we would stress that there is no guarantee this will work.”",2023/3/14,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834043,Autopsy: 'Cop City' protester had hands raised when killed,"DECATUR, Ga. (AP) — An environmental activist who was fatally shot in a confrontation with Georgia law enforcement in January was sitting cross-legged with their hands in the air at the time, the protester’s family said Monday as they released results of an autopsy they commissioned.The family of Manuel Paez Terán held a news conference in Decatur to announce the findings and said they are filing an open-records lawsuit seeking to force Atlanta police to release more evidence about the Jan. 18 killing of Paez Terán, who went by the name Tortuguita and used the pronoun they.The family’s attorneys said the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, which has been probing the shooting for nearly two months, has prevented Atlanta police from releasing additional evidence to the family. The wooded area where Paez Terán was killed has long been dubbed “Cop City” by opponents who occupied the forest there to protest the 85-acre (34-hectare) tract being developed as a massive police and firefighter training facility.“Manuel was looking death in the face, hands raised when killed,” civil rights attorney Brian Spears said, citing the autopy’s conclusions. “We do not stand here today telling you that we know what happened. The second autopsy is a snapshot of what happened, but it is not the whole story. What we want is simple: GBI, meet with the family and release the investigative report.”In a statement, the bureau said it's preventing “inappropriate release of evidence” to preserve the investigation's integrity.Paez Terán's death and their dedication to opposing the training center has vaulted the “Stop Cop City” movement onto the national and international stage, with leftist activists from across the country holding vigils and prompting some to travel and join the protest movement that began in 2021. A few protests have turned violent, including earlier this month when more than 150 masked activists left a nearby music festival and stormed the proposed site of the training center, setting fire to construction equipment and throwing rocks at retreating law enforcement officers.Authorities have said officers fired on Paez Terán after the 26-year-old shot and seriously injured a state trooper while officers cleared activists from an Atlanta-area forest where officials plan to build the training center. The investigative bureau says it continues to back its initial assessment of what happened.Paez Terán had been camping in the forest for months to oppose building “Cop City.” Their family and friends have said the activist practiced non-violence and have accused authorities of state-sanctioned murder.The investigative bureau has said no body camera or dashcam footage of the shooting exists, and that ballistics evidence shows the injured trooper was shot with a bullet from a gun Paez Terán legally purchased in 2020.Spears said the family commissioned a second autopsy after the DeKalb County Medical Examiner’s Office conducted an initial one. Officials have not released the DeKalb County report, so it's unclear whether it reached a similar conclusion that Paez Terán had their hands raised, the palms facing inward at the time of the shooting.“Manuel loved the forest,” their grieving mother, Belkis Terán, said. “It gave them peace. They meditiated there. The forest connected them with God. I never thought that Manuel could die in a meditation position.”The family's autopsy report describes Paez Terán’s body as being torn up, shot at least a dozen times and that “many of the wound tracks within his body converge, coalesce and intersect, rendering the ability to accurately determine each and every individual wound track very limited, if even impossible.”The report also says it is “impossible to determine"" whether the activist was holding a firearm at the time they were shot.The autopsy was conducted by Dr. Kris Sperry, who was the investigation bureau's longtime chief medical examiner until he abruptly resigned in 2015 after the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that Sperry “claimed hundreds of work hours at the GBI when he actually was working for clients of his forensic-science consulting firm.”Atlanta City Council approved building the proposed $90 million Atlanta Public Safety Training Center in 2021, saying a state-of-the-art campus would replace substandard offerings and boost police morale, which is beset by hiring and retention struggles in the wake of violent protests against racial injustice that roiled the city after George Floyd’s death in 2020.In addition to classrooms and administrative buildings, the training center would include a shooting range, a driving course to practice chases and a “burn building” for firefighters to work on putting out fires. A “mock village” featuring a fake home, convenience store and nightclub would also be built for authorities to rehearse raids.Paez Terán moved from Florida last year to join activists in the woods who were protesting by camping out at the site and building platforms in surrounding trees.Self-described “forest defenders” say that building the training center would involve cutting down so many trees it would damage the environment. They also oppose investing so much money in a project which they say will be used to practice “urban warfare.”Since Paez Terán’s death, numerous protests have been held in Atlanta, some of which have turned violent, including when masked activists on Jan. 21 lit a police car on fire and shattered the windows of a downtown skyscraper that houses the Atlanta Police Foundation and.On March 5, a group threw flaming bottles and rocks at officers as others torched heavy machinery at the construction site where the training center is expected to be built. Twenty-three people are facing domestic terrorism charges in connection with that attack. Activists maintain that those who were arrested were not violent agitators “but peaceful concert-goers who were nowhere near the demonstration.”",2023/3/14,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834045,Flood problems grow as new storm moves into California,"WATSONVILLE, Calif. (AP) — Crews rushed to repair a levee break on a storm-swollen river in California's central coast as yet another atmospheric river arrived Monday with the potential to wallop the state's swamped farmland and agricultural communities.The Pajaro River's first levee rupture grew to at least 400 feet (120 meters) since it failed late Friday, officials said. More than 8,500 people were forced to evacuate, and about 50 people had to be rescued as the water rose that night.Still, some stayed behind in Pajaro, an unincorporated community that's known for its strawberry crops and is now mostly flooded. The largely Latino farmworker community there is already struggling to find food with so many roads and businesses closed in the storm's aftermath.“Some people have nowhere to go and maybe that’s why there’s still people around,"" resident Jorbelit Rincon said Monday. ""Pretty much they don’t know where to go and don’t have money to provide for themselves.”A second breach opened up another 100 feet (30.48 meters) of the levee closer to the Pacific coast, providing a “relief valve” for the floodwaters to recede near the mouth of the river, officials said Monday during a news conference.Built in the late 1940s to provide flood protection, the levee has been a known risk for decades and had several breaches in the 1990s. Emergency repairs to a section of the berm were undertaken in January. A $400 million rebuild is set to begin in the next few years.Forecasters warned of more flooding, wind damage and potential power outages from the new atmospheric river that came ashore Monday evening in northern and central parts of the state and was expected to move south over several days. California has been pummeled this winter by 10 atmospheric rivers, which are long, narrow plumes of moisture that turn into rain and snow when they make landfall.Along the Southern California coast, evacuation orders were scheduled to take effect at 8 a.m. Tuesday in Santa Barbara County for several areas that were burned by wildfires in recent years. Burned soil can be water-repellent, increasing the risk of flash floods and flows of debris such as downed trees, according to the National Weather Service.Water from the newest storm will likely go over the Pajaro River's levee — but crews were working to make sure the rupture doesn't get any larger, said Shaunna Murray of the Monterey County Water Resources Agency. Over the weekend, crews had to build access roads to get to the site of the breach, and bring in rocks and boulders to plug the gap.The river separates Santa Cruz and Monterey counties, about 70 miles (110 kilometers) south of San Francisco. Several roads were closed including a stretch of coastal Highway 1, a main route between the two counties.Monterey County officials also warned that the Salinas River could cause significant flooding of roadways and agricultural land, cutting off the Monterey Peninsula from the rest of the county. The city of Monterey and other communities are located on the peninsula.Undersheriff Keith Boyd said first responders have rescued about 170 people who were stranded within the county's evacuation areas since Friday, including a woman and her baby who got stuck trying to drive through high waters.The undersheriff said 20 to 40 people remained trapped Monday near the Salinas River because the roads were impassible for rescuers.Authorities had not received reports of any deaths or missing persons related to the storm as of Monday afternoon.Winery and agricultural experts from the region said they are concerned about the storms' impact on crops — both ones in the ground that are currently submerged, and ones that should be planted for the upcoming growing season.Karla Loreto, who works at a Pajaro gas station, said she is worried about the toll the flooding will take on the area's farmworkers.“The fields are flooded right now,"" she said Monday. ""Probably no jobs there right now. For this year, probably no strawberries, no blackberries, no blueberries.”Gov. Gavin Newsom on Sunday declared a state of emergency in six more counties after earlier making declarations for 34 counties.Last week’s atmospheric river carried warm subtropical moisture that caused melting at lower elevations of California's Sierra Nevada snowpack, adding to runoff that has swelled rivers and streams.But the snowpack is so deep and cold that it mostly absorbed the rain, resulting in an even greater snowpack in the southern and central Sierra, said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles.California Department of Water Resources online data showed Monday that the water content of the Sierra snowpack was 207% of the April 1 average, when it is normally at its peak. In the southern Sierra it was 248% of the average.___Antczak reported from Los Angeles. Associated Press writers Stefanie Dazio and Christopher Weber contributed from Los Angeles.",2023/3/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834046,Review: U2 reworks past in thrilling 'Songs of Surrender',"“Songs of Surrender,” U2 (Universal)Imagine walking into your living room and all your stuff is there, but it's different. The sofa has moved, the bookcase is leaning on a different wall and the framed photos have swapped locations. That's the feeling you get listening to U2's new album.“Songs of Surrender” is a “reimagining” of 40 songs from the Irish quartet's deep catalogue, cleverly presented from “One” to “40.” Think of it as a thrilling home makeover.“I want to tear down the walls that hold me inside,” Bono sings in the new “Where the Streets Have No Name” — lyrics that perfectly fit this sonic experiment. This version of the song is virtually unrecognizable from the one the band made famous in 1987.That's the point of this exercise led by Bono and The Edge. “Once we surrendered our reverence for the original version, each song started to open up to a new authentic voice of this time,” The Edge writes in the liner notes.There are triumphs and a few fumbles, but there's a growing realization that the architecture of these songs is strong indeed, even with some new lyrics. The new “Vertigo” has Middle Eastern instrumentations, while an acoustic guitar-driven “Sunday Bloody Sunday” sounds more like something from a coffeehouse open-mic night than a strident arena-ready demand. But they're both still gorgeous.Some might even be improvements. One of the band's earliest hits — “11 O'Clock Tick Tock” — is smoother, slower and cleaner than the original. And would you believe the new “The Miracle (Of Joey Ramone)” might be better than the one on “Songs of Innocence”?Many reworkings are relatively straight-forward, like “Cedarwood Road,” “Peace on Earth,” “Bad” and “I Will Follow.” Most have a stripped-down feel, which gives Bono's voice little shelter amid moody keyboards or choppy acoustic guitar. “Every Breaking Wave” is cinematic, like something that should run over the end credits when an anguished drama has faded to black.“I Still Haven’t Found What I’m Looking For,” gets a cowboy vibe and unexpected honky-tonky electricity. “Desire” has Bono high in his falsetto against a strummy dulcimer and the effect is hypnotic.“Get Out of Your Own Way” is remade as a Mumford & Sons tune, in a good way, and the new “Stuck in a Moment” is a folkish prayer, the structure holding. The new “One” is a little marred by a choir effect, but it is such a beautiful song that it could be remade as a punk tune and it would still sparkle.Listening to the new “Sometime You Can't Make It On Your Own” is like running into an ex who is barely recognizable. The reworked “With or Without You” has an air of antiseptic menace.One effect of the album is to put Bono's lyrics under a spotlight, making his words and imagery more pronounced. The new “Ordinary Love” emerges like a tone poem, the new “Invisible” reveals deeper pain than originally sang.Some don't work, as when the grimness of “Red Hill Mining Town” is undercut by horns, effectively remaking it into a defanged children's song. The new “Beautiful Day” is not an improvement over the original; it has been made lounge-y and meandering, despite some nifty new lyrics.In a new “Pride (In the Name of Love),” Bono's voice has been harnessed and tamed, losing the original's stridency and anger. And the new “40” — with Bono appropriately arguing “I will sing a new song” — has been made limp and passive.If you're not a U2 fan, this collection will not convince you to embrace them. If you are a mega-fan, you will marvel at their mutability. And if you are a casual fan, you must admire a band willing to get in its own way.___Mark Kennedy is at http://twitter.com/KennedyTwits___For more AP Music reviews, go to: https://apnews.com/hub/music-reviews",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834047,Byron emerges as another star in Hendrick's deep lineup,"AVONDALE, Ariz. (AP) — Kyle Larson is widely considered to be the most naturally-gifted driver at Hendrick Motorsports and there's little doubt that Chase Elliott is the most popular.But as of March 2023, William Byron might just be the team's best driver.It's been a slow, steady rise for Byron, who has won two straight NASCAR Cup Series races after pushing past Larson in overtime on Sunday at Phoenix Raceway during a pair of frantic restarts. The 25-year-old won in remarkably similar fashion last week at Las Vegas.“We have four capable teams and four capable drivers of carrying the banner every weekend,” Byron's crew chief Rudy Fugle said. “Pretty amazing.”Byron got a relatively late start in racing as a teenager, but has been a quick study. The North Carolina native won twice last season and now looks like a weekly threat while teaming with Fugle.This is Byron's sixth season with Hendrick Motorsports and he received a contact extension last season after winning two races early in the year at Atlanta and Martinsville. He had a mid-season lull before closing with seven top 10s in his final 11 races and finished sixth in the Cup standings.It's part of a progression that's slowly pushed him among NASCAR's elite drivers. He was 21st overall in his first full Cup season in 2018, before improving to 11th, 14th, 10th and then sixth in the ensuing years.Now with two wins in the season's first four races, it's clear Byron is aiming for the No. 1 spot.“This level is so different. Took a lot of homework, a lot of details,” Byron said. “I think the fact that I started later than most driving was a little bit — it took some time to bridge that gap at this level.""Now that gap is bridged obviously.”Jeff Gordon — one of NASCAR's most successful drivers who is now vice chairman of Hendrick Motorsports — knows a little about winning for Hendrick. His 93 victories are the most in team history.Gordon sees Byron as a growing driver just now realizing his potential.“I see a progression with William ever since he came to Hendrick,” Jeff Gordon said. ""Got to remember how young he was coming into the Cup Series, so much to learn. Young in racing in so many ways.“When Rudy came to Hendrick, the instant connection and chemistry between these two was so obvious. It just took the whole team up to another notch. I think now they’re just building on that. It’s a lot of fun to watch and see.”Byron's back-to-back wins are part of a stellar start to the season for Hendrick's Chevrolets. Larson is a threat to win nearly every week and seven-time Cup winner Alex Bowman has four top 10s in four races.Even Josh Berry — filling in for the injured Elliott — was competitive at Phoenix, finishing in 10th place. Berry will likely get a few more races in the No. 9 Chevrolet as Elliott recovers from a broken leg suffered in a snowboarding accident.“To get out of an Xfinity car and hop into a Cup car that’s so different I think is a big, tall task,” Gordon said. “We put him in a bad situation last week. This week I saw him putting in the effort and the time, the sim, getting fitted in the seat, doing his homework. It really showed up.”The only bad news for Hendrick came on Friday, when NASCAR officials took the hood louvers from the team's four cars, bringing them to the NASCAR Research & Development Center in North Carolina for inspection. Any potential penalties would be announced this week.Gordon said that issue was obviously a concern, but it's hard to damper the mood at Hendrick, which is looking awfully tough with its group of young and increasingly successful teams.Gordon called the hood louvers issue a “miscommunication.”“I don’t want to go any further than that,” Gordon said. “We’ll continue to just share all the facts and be transparent with NASCAR as we have been so far.”___AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834048,"Defense budget speeds toward $1 trillion, with China in mind","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Pentagon intends to load up on advanced missiles, space defense and modern jets in its largest defense request in decades in order to meet the threat it perceives from China. The spending path would put the military's annual budget over the $1 trillion threshold in just a matter of years, its chief financial officer said Monday.The administration is asking Congress for $842 billion for the Pentagon in the 2024 budget year. It’s the largest request since the peak of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars in the mid-2000s, when the weight of hundreds of thousands of troops deployed in those overseas conflicts ballooned overseas war spending.Now, the budget could surge again. That's in part to meet the higher cost of weapons and parts, but also to answer the vulnerabilities that the Ukraine war has exposed in the U.S. defense industrial base, and the strategic threat the U.S. sees from China’s rapidly growing nuclear arsenal, its hypersonic capabilities and its gains in space.Even if it only grows to account for inflation, “the budget will hit a trillion dollars,” probably before the next five years, Pentagon comptroller Michael McCord told a press briefing. “Maybe that’s going to be a psychological, big watershed moment for many of us, or some of us, but it is inevitable.”While the number seems astronomically high, it is only about 3% of the country's gross domestic product. For comparison, during World War II the country was spending about one-third of its GDP on defense, McCord said.The budget request is part of an overall $6.8 trillion spending proposal rolled out by Biden last week, which Republicans say they’ll reject. But it’s not clear how they’ll act on the Pentagon proposal.Some Republicans want to go beyond the military spending request. But some have also demanded sharp reductions in federal spending — something that would be difficult to accomplish without touching the defense budget.While personnel and operations costs remain the largest portions of the annual defense budget, Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks called this years’ request “a procurement budget” with the Pentagon increasing buys across the board of modern weapon systems.One of the largest new priorities is getting the U.S. defense industrial base to speed production of munitions. Ukraine’s rate of use of 155 Howitzer rounds and other precision munitions has shown the U.S. defense industrial base “is not where it needs to be,” McCord said.It’s been a lesson learned over the last year, particularly as the U.S. assesses how best it can prevent a similar fight over Taiwan, which could pit it against China.The goal of the budget is to ensure China ""wakes up every day, considers the risks of aggression, and concludes, ‘today is not the day,’” Hicks said.The administration, for example, is asking Congress for $30 billion to produce more missiles. But they are “not the kind of missiles that are key to the Ukraine fight,” McCord said. ""These are key to Indo-Pacific deterrence,” a goal also involving advanced air-to-air missiles, anti-ship missiles and long-range standoff missiles.The Pentagon is also seeking rapid modernization of its air, space and nuclear weapons. The request includes almost $38 billion to buy new nuclear submarines, field the new B-21 stealth bomber and manufacture new ground-based intercontinental ballistic missiles.The request would also fund research and testing for a new type of warplane, called Next Generation Air Dominance, which will have a piloted modern fighter jet, such as the F-35, commanding unmanned drones that accompany it on missions. The Air Force won’t say much about the drones, which they are calling “collaborative combat aircraft” – except that they are planning to field 1,000 of them.The request includes the “largest space budget ever,"" McCord said, as space has proven to be vital in the war in Ukraine and a critical front in any future confrontation. The Pentagon is seeking $33 billion to make its satellite communications more resilient to jamming or attack and rapidly field a new constellation of missile warning systems to assist in the detection, tracking and defense against a new generation of Chinese and Russian hypersonic missiles.Even the Chinese spy balloon episode had an impact, even though the budget request was largely completed before the balloon was detected, drifted across the country and was shot down. The Pentagon is seeking about $90 million to add capabilities to better detect similar objects in the atmosphere in the future.",2023/3/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834049,"AP source: Jimmy Garoppolo, Raiders agree to 3-year deal","HENDERSON, Nev. (AP) — Jimmy Garoppolo has agreed to a three-year, $67.5 million contract with the Raiders, a person with knowledge of the deal told The Associated Press on Monday, likely answering the question of who will be Las Vegas' starting quarterback next season.The person spoke to The AP on condition of anonymity because the deal can't be announced until Wednesday.Garoppolo's contract includes $34 million in the guaranteed money, the person said.The Raiders have been linked to Garoppolo almost from the moment coach Josh McDaniels benched nine-year starter Derek Carr with two weeks left in the season. Carr, the Raiders' all-time leader with 35,222 passing yards and 217 touchdown passes, has since signed with the New Orleans Saints.McDaniels was the Patriots' offensive coordinator when Garoppolo backed up Tom Brady in New England beginning in 2014. With Brady locked in as the starter, Garoppolo was traded to San Francisco during the 2017 season and immediately became the 49ers' starter.He was effective when healthy, going 38-17 and taking the Niners to the 2019 and 2021 NFC championship games. San Francisco made the Super Bowl in the 2019 season.But the 31-year-old Garoppolo has had several significant injuries. In 2018, he suffered a season-ending knee injury in San Francisco's third game, and in 2020 he missed eight games with ankle injuries.The 49ers had planned to trade Garoppolo before last season and start Trey Lance, the third overall pick in the 2021 draft whom San Francisco gave up three first-round picks to acquire. Garoppolo underwent offseason shoulder surgery, killing trade interest in him from other clubs, so the 49ers re-signed him at a reduced deal.When Lance was injured two games into the season, Garoppolo agains took over as the starter. He was having his best year, throwing 16 touchdown passes and four interceptions in 10 games, before going down with a season-ending foot injury.Rookie Brock Purdy, the last player selected in last year's draft, took over and led the Niners to the NFC championship game, where they lost to Philadelphia. Purdy suffered an elbow injury early in that game and had surgery last week, but after he concludes his rehab, the Niners will have two potential starters on the roster in Purdy and Lance.Garoppolo joins a Raiders team coming off a 6-11 season, but with an offense that includes wide receivers Davante Adams and Hunter Renfrow and tight end Darren Waller. Las Vegas also has placed the franchise tag on running back Josh Jacobs, who led the NFL in rushing last season.The Raiders own the seventh pick in the draft and could draft a quarterback with that selection or one in the later rounds. Expected backup Jarrett Stidham agreed to sign with the AFC West rival Denver Broncos.They have plenty of salary cap space, especially after restructuring defensive end Maxx Crosby's contract to free up $7.5 million, according to ESPN. Including Garoppolo's deal, Las Vegas has $27.4 million in cap space, according to overthecap.com.The Raiders have plenty of needs to address, particularly on the offensive line and throughout the defense.___AP Pro Football Writer Rob Maaddi contributed to this report.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/3/14,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834053,Nashville sues over Tennessee law halving metro council size,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Nashville officials on Monday sued over a new Tennessee law that will cut the Democratic-leaning city's metro council in half, a move that follows the council’s rejection of efforts to host the 2024 Republican National Convention in Music City.The law reduces Nashville’s combined council from 40 members to 20. Though it applies broadly to city or city-county governments, Nashville is the only one that is affected.The lawsuit says the reduction violates requirements in the state Constitution about councilmember term lengths and local control. Additionally, the lawsuit argues that it's too close to this year's council elections in August to make the overhaul. Officials say more than 40 candidates are already running.Republican Gov. Bill Lee signed the proposal Thursday, shortly after the Senate cast the final vote needed. Lee's spokesperson declined to comment on pending litigation. Elizabeth Lane, spokesperson for state Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti, said the office ""stands ready to defend the law.""""In imposing these Council-reduction requirements on Metro Nashville just before a local election, the General Assembly undermines the purpose of local-government consolidation, ignores numerous other constitutional prohibitions on such a reduction, and creates confusion and chaos among citizens and candidates,"" the lawsuit in Davidson County Chancery Court states.Republican lawmakers who spurred the change argue that they're acting within their legal authority to reduce an oversized government.“Local government bodies need to be a size that allows them to function efficiently and effectively without compromising their duty to represent the people,” Sen. Bo Watson, the bill's sponsor, said last month.Critics in Nashville have decried efforts to reconfigure its elected government while the city continues to grow and pull in more visitors, residents and revenue to the state. Others have argued that the change will erode representation of minority communities and hamper council members’ ability to address constituent needs.The statute requires Nashville to craft new council districts by May 1 — a deadline Nashville’s legal officials say is unreasonable. The lawsuit says the law rushes a redistricting process with various requirements, including minority vote dilution standards under the federal Voting Rights Act.The law says that if a metro government can’t make the changes for the next election, current members’ terms are extended a year, and the next term will shrink to three years, then return to four for subsequent councils. The lawsuit says the scheme violates the state constitution.Nashville has operated as a combined city-county government under a 40-member council since 1963, when leaders were wrestling with consolidating the city with the surrounding county, and others were working to ensure Black leaders maintain a strong representation in the Southern city.To date, a quarter of the council’s seats are held by Black members, half are held by women and five identify as LGBTQ.State lawmakers in the General Assembly have “reneged” on a “constitutional compact” by shrinking the council without local voters' approval, according to a court filing by Nashville that seeks to block the law while the lawsuit proceeds. Additionally, local voters declined to reduce the council's size during a 2015 vote, the filing notes.Meanwhile, the fight over local control is playing at statehouses across the country.In Mississippi, Black lawmakers have denounced a plan by the state’s majority-white and Republican-led Legislature to take over power from the capital city of Jackson. In Missouri, lawmakers are pursuing legislation to strip power from the Black woman elected as the St. Louis prosecutor. Missouri lawmakers are also pursuing a bill that would allow Missouri’s governor to control St. Louis police.In Tennessee, the new law is one of several proposals the Republican-dominant Legislature has proposed this year after Nashville leaders spiked a proposal to host the Republican National Committee last year.A separate bill would give the state control of the governing board for the city’s airport, stadiums and other landmarks, while another would remove Nashville’s ability to charge the tax that funds its convention center. Republicans have also offered a bill that would block cities from using public funds for reimbursing employees who travel to get an abortion.The bills align with Tennessee Republicans' push to limit Nashville and other cities over the years. This has included curtailing Nashville and other cities’ ability to ban short-term rentals, including Airbnb, and barring cities from decriminalizing possession of small amounts of marijuana — which Nashville and Memphis had moved to do.",2023/3/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834054,Ex-Jordanian official hospitalized after hunger strike,"A former top Jordanian official imprisoned in an alleged plot against the Western-allied monarchy was rushed to the hospital over the weekend after a three-week hunger strike, the man’s American lawyer said Monday.Bassem Awadallah, who is a dual Jordanian-American citizen, was suffering from low blood pressure and sugar levels when he was hospitalized Saturday, his representatives said.They said he was given glucose intravenously but refused further intervention once his condition stabilized. He has since returned to prison and remains on his hunger strike.“My client’s life remains in danger as his health declines daily,” said Michael J. Sullivan, Awadallah’s attorney.He said Awadallah’s family has urged the U.S. government to “take immediate action” to secure his release and holds Jordan’s King Abdullah II responsible for the harm to Awadallah.A Jordanian security official called the claims of a hunger strike “inaccurate,” saying Awadallah has been drinking liquids regularly.“He was hospitalized at the recommendation of the medical team and later discharged after receiving the necessary treatment,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity under security guidelines. “He is now in good condition.”The official said there was no obligation for Jordanian officials to notify the American Embassy because Awadallah is a Jordanian “first and foremost.” But he said that Awadallah is entitled to U.S. consular visits, including this week.In a statement, the U.S. State Department said it was monitoring Awadallah's situation closely, and that one of its priorities was to assist U.S. citizens who are incarcerated abroad.“We take allegations of mistreatment seriously,” it said. “We at every instance raise the importance of humane treatment directly with the host government.” It said the embassy met Awadallah this week, the latest in a string of monthly visits over the past year.Jordan is a close Western ally that hosts hundreds of thousands of refugees and has long been seen as an island of stability in a volatile region. But the rare palace feud exposed deep-rooted economic and social challenges in the country, which borders Israel, the occupied West Bank, Syria, Iraq and Saudi Arabia.Awadallah, who once served as a top adviser to the king, and Sharif Hassan bin Zaid, a member of the royal family, were found guilty of sedition and incitement two years ago and sentenced to 15 years in prison. They were alleged to have conspired with Prince Hamzah, the king’s half-brother, and to have sought foreign assistance in a plot against Abdullah.The convictions took place following a closed trial that lasted just six sessions in a military court. The court denied requests by defense lawyers to call witnesses, and prosecutors shared only purported transcripts, but not original audio recordings, from surveillance of the alleged plotters.Awadallah’s representatives have said the trial lacked due process and that Awadallah has endured inhumane conditions. Jordan denies the allegations, saying his treatment has been “in accordance with international conventions and legal standards.”Hamzah was placed under house arrest in April 2021 for his alleged role in the plot. At the time, he said he was being punished for speaking out against official corruption.He apologized to the king a year ago, according to the Royal Court, but the following month, he formally relinquished his princely title to protest the “current approaches, policies and methods of our institutions.”Last May, the king placed Hamzah back under house arrest, citing his half-brother’s “erratic behavior and aspirations.”Abdullah and Hamzah are sons of King Hussein, who ruled Jordan for nearly half a century before his death in 1999. Abdullah appointed Hamzah as crown prince upon his succession but stripped him of the title in 2004.",2023/3/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834055,Police: 4 die in shooting at Dallas apartment building,"DALLAS (AP) — A man and woman charged in the fatal shootings of four people at a Dallas apartment where an infant was found unharmed told police they'd broken into the home to take money, according to court documents.Artemio Maldonado, 18, and Azucena Sanchez, 20, have been charged with capital murder, police said Monday. Jail records did not list an attorney for either suspect.Police responded to the apartment around 7:10 p.m. Sunday and found two men and two women who had been shot. They all died at the scene. Authorities have not released the names of the victims.Sanchez was the ex-girlfriend of one of the victims and they were involved in a custody dispute over their son, according to court documents. It wasn’t clear whether or not that child was the infant who remained in the apartment following the shootings.According to court documents, Sanchez told police that she and Maldonado broke into the apartment to rob it. Sanchez said she didn’t think anyone was home but once inside, the victims confronted the pair, court documents said.Maldonado admitted to shooting all of the victims, according to court documents. Maldonado and Sanchez took a box from a closet they thought contained money, but it turned out to be empty.Officers were called to the scene after a person checked on the occupants after not hearing from them, police spokeswoman Kristin Lowman said. She said police later learned that popping sounds had been heard around 1 a.m. but that no one had called police.Lowman said there was a dispute between one of the suspects and one of the victims, but could not go into detail. She said there was no a threat to the public or anyone else in the apartment complex.Police said officers located the suspects' vehicle a few miles from the scene at about 9:30 p.m. Sunday and both were taken into custody just after 10 p.m.Lowman said the infant wasn't injured but was taken to the hospital as a precaution. She said the infant is now in the care of Child Protective Services.The investigation into the shooting is ongoing.",2023/3/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834056,Spain's ombudsman registers 445 church sex abuse complaints,"MADRID (AP) — Spain’s ombudsman said Monday that an independent commission set up a year ago to investigate historic sex abuse by the Catholic church has collected testimonies from 445 victims, as the nation tackles an issue other European countries acted on long ago.Spain's parliament voted on March 10, 2022 to open the first official investigation, led by ombudsman Ángel Gabilondo, into the extent of sexual abuse committed by priests and church officials. The government was forced to act after allegations of abuse involving more than 1,200 victims were published in Spanish newspaper El País, provoking public outrage.Testimonies were still being collected and an update would be issued in parliament before the current government's term expires this year, Gabilondo's office said in a statement. Although “satisfied” with the number of victims who felt able to come forward, “what really matters is to listen to the victims ... with respect, seriousness, discretion and confidentiality,” it added.A Madrid-based law firm is conducting a parallel inquiry ordered by the Spanish Episcopal Conference, which for years rejected the idea of taking a comprehensive approach to investigating sex abuse.In a sign that bishops may yet to have fully cooperated with the government-ordered probe, the Spanish ombudsman said that a year after receiving his mandate, “we are requesting the collaboration of different levels of the Catholic Church and we hope to be able to count on it soon.”Only a handful of countries have had government-initiated or parliamentary inquiries into abuse like Spain's.The most extensive took place in Australia and found in 2017 that 7% of Catholic priests were accused of abusing minors between 1980 and 2010. Judge-led investigations in Ireland from 2005 impacted the Catholic Church’s once-dominant influence in Irish society and politics.And in France, an independent inquiry estimated in 2021 that some 330,000 children were victims of sexual abuse by Catholic clergy or other Catholic-affiliated lay employees from 1950-2020.In neighboring Portugal, an expert panel said last month that more than 4,800 individuals may have been victims of child sex abuse in the Catholic Church.",2023/3/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834057,"School pulls test question equating politics to race, gender","FALLS CHURCH, Va. (AP) — Virginia's largest school system is removing a test question given to a college-level social studies class that equated liberals and conservatives with specific racial and gender demographics.The question appeared on a test given to students of an AP Government class at Fairfax County Public Schools' Online Campus.The multiple-choice question asked students, “Which of the following is an accurate comparison of liberals versus conservatives?”The potential answers for “liberals” included “Young, white males;"" “Middle aged, urban lesbian;” “College-educated black male professional"" and “White, upper-middle class suburban male.”The potential answers for “conservatives” included “East Coast, Ivy League educated scientists;” “Southern male migrant laborer;” “Catholic, midwestern middle-aged male” and “West coast, Hispanic teacher. ”Rory Cooper, a Fairfax County parent and school system critic who posted the question on Twitter, said it is offensive.“It's one thing for adults to analyze demographic trends,” he said. “It's another to tell students that their identity defines their political philosophy.”The school system said in a statement that the question will be removed from future tests because it “did not meet the division's high expectations.” It also said all test questions administered to students in the AP Government Online Campus class will now be reviewed.The statement said the question was “designed to assess 12th graders’ understanding of American political ideology.”The test is part of an AP, or Advanced Placement, class that allows high-school students to earn college credit if they score well on a final exam.While the question was part of an AP class, it was not created by the College Board, which administers the AP program nationally.In a tweet, the College Board said the question “is antithetical to the content and format of an AP question.”Virginia Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears weighed in as well, criticizing the assumptions the question makes about who is liberal and who is conservative. She has frequently bristled at outsiders' political assumptions about Black women that are at odds with her stance as a conservative Republican and military veteran.“Tests like these create division, low morale, fights in our schools,” she wrote in one tweet.The question is just the latest in a series of critiques that have been levied against public educators. Conservative activists have questioned curricula that they say promote progressive ideology over education fundamentals.The debate has been particularly intense in Virginia, where Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin has made education reform a priority and has sought to change how schools deal with transgender students.Earlier this year, Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares announced an investigation of the school system after reports that high schools withheld letters of commendation on standardized tests from some students on the theory that it would hurt the feelings of students who didn't receive them.",2023/3/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834058,Biden administration lets Ukrainians who fled war stay in US,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration is allowing thousands of Ukrainians who fled their homeland when Russia invaded a year ago to stay in the United States longer, the administration said Monday. The decision provides relief to Ukrainians whose one-year authorization to remain in the U.S. was set to expire soon.The Homeland Security Department said the extension is for certain Ukrainian nationals and their immediate family members who were let into the U.S. before the Uniting for Ukraine program started.Ukrainians who came in under the Uniting for Ukraine program generally got two years of humanitarian “parole” in the U.S. whereas those who arrived before them generally got permission to stay only for one year. Resettlement agencies have estimated that there are about 20,000 Ukrainians in the one-year group.Thousands of Ukrainians came to America last year fleeing the war.The U.S. government used a program called humanitarian parole to admit them into the country. That program is a way to allow people from other countries to enter the United States on an emergency basis due to an urgent humanitarian situation. But it is usually for a finite amount of time, like a year or two years, and must be renewed for people to stay longer.In recent years, humanitarian parole has been employed as a quick fix to deal with the fallout from the many world crises that have occurred as the U.S. refugee system that was dismantled by the previous administration was being built back up.Now numerous groups are seeing their permission to remain in the United States expiring in coming months, including tens of thousands of Afghans.That has led to intense anxiety for thousands of people who fled war in their homeland and don’t know whether they’ll be kicked out of the U.S. when their humanitarian parole status expires. The uncertainty can also be difficult for the businesses that employ them and need to make sure their employees are properly authorized to remain in the country.Ukraine and immigration have both been hot button topics among Republican politicians who aren’t enthusiastic about continuing aid to the war and have accused the Biden administration of not doing enough to control migration at the southern border. But even in that toxic political environment, there’s been little movement to force Ukrainians to return home, reflecting widespread acceptance that it’s still too dangerous for them there.The Homeland Security Department said the announcement specifically refers to Ukrainians who came into the U.S. on humanitarian parole status from February 24, 2022 through April 25, 2022. They do not need to file any paperwork with the government to get the extension. The department will review cases of Ukrainians that fall in this category over the next four weeks to vet them for the extension, starting with those who came to the U.S. the earliest.Many groups that work with people who come to the U.S. after being forcibly displaced from their countries had been advocating for the extension. In a statement the head of Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, Krish O’Mara Vignarajah said the extension would provide relief to thousands of anxious Ukrainians.“For this earliest-arrived group of Ukrainians, the continued legal right to live, work, and access resettlement assistance in the U.S. is absolutely crucial to their well-being,” she said. The organization also called on the administration in the future to not wait until so close to the deadline to extend “critical humanitarian protections,” and noted that many of the thousands of Afghans who came into the country on humanitarian parole will start seeing their protections expire this summer. __Follow Santana on Twitter @ruskygal.",2023/3/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834059,Mexican president says his country safer than United States,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico’s president claimed Monday that his country is safer than the United States, a week after two U.S. citizens were killed and two kidnapped and later rescued in the border city of Matamoros.President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said U.S. travel warnings and reports of violence in Mexico were the result of a conspiracy by conservative politicians and U.S. media outlets to smear his administration.Despite López Obrador’s assurances that Mexico was safe for travel, the FBI confirmed last week that three other women from the small Texas town of Peñitas have been missing in Mexico since late February.“Mexico is safer than the United States,” López Obrador said at his morning news briefing. “There is no problem in traveling safely in Mexico.”Mexico's nationwide homicide rate is about 28 per 100,000 inhabitants. By comparison, the U.S. homicide rate is barely one-quarter as high, at around 7 per 100,000.The president brushed off continued concern over violence. Currently, the U.S. State Department has “do not travel” advisories for six of Mexico's 32 states plagued by drug cartel violence, and “reconsider travel” warnings for another seven states.“This is a campaign against Mexico by these conservative politicians in the United States who do not want the transformation of our country to continue,” López Obrador said.The Mexican president included U.S. media outlets in the supposed conspiracy.“These conservative politicians ... dominate the majority of the news media in the United States,” he said. “This violence is not a reality,” he added. “It is pure, vile manipulation.”As if to undercut that statement, police in the industrial and farming state of Guanajuato reported that 8 people had been shot to death and another seven wounded in an attack on a nightclub over the weekend.The attack late Saturday killed six men and two women at the club in the largely rural township of Apaseo El Grande, where rival cartels have been fighting for control for years.",2023/3/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834060,US Soccer: Berhalter eligible to coach after investigation,"NEW YORK (AP) — Gregg Berhalter remains a candidate to stay on as the U.S. men’s national team coach after a report by a law firm determined he did not improperly withhold information about a 1992 domestic violence allegation involving the woman who later became his wife.The report, released publicly Monday by the U.S. Soccer Federation, also concluded that Berhalter's conduct “likely constituted the misdemeanor crime of assault on a female.”Berhalter’s contract expired on Dec. 31 and Anthony Hudson, one of his assistants, was appointed interim coach on Jan. 4. The coaching decision will be made after a new sporting director is hired.“Me and my wife, Rosalind, respect the process that U.S. Soccer went through,” Gregg Berhalter told The Associated Press in a telephone interview from Britain. “We look forward to what is next.”“I'm open to all options,” he added. “It's a job that interests me, and I'm keeping all options open.”The firm Alston and Bird was retained after former U.S. captain Claudio Reyna and wife Danielle Egan Reyna, the parents of current American midfielder Gio Reyna, informed the USSF of the 1992 incident following the decision by Berhalter to use Gio Reyna sparingly at last year’s World Cup.The firm concluded the Reynas were not guilty of extortion but said Claudio Reyna’s conduct might have violated provisions of FIFA's code of ethics for conflicts of interest, protection of physical and mental integrity, and abuse of position.Claudio Reyna resigned as technical director of Major League Soccer’s Austin team on Jan. 26.The probe included interviews with 16 witnesses, but investigators said Claudio Reyna refused to be interviewed — an assertion he denied through his agent. It included details on the incident between Berhalter and the then-Rosalind Santana in January 1992 at a bar and nightclub in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where Berhalter and Santana were students and Santana was a roommate of Danielle Egan, who went on to play for the U.S. women's national team.“Mr. and Mrs. Berhalter were both 18 years old and drinking alcohol on the night in question; they began to argue inside the bar; they left the bar together and continued to argue,” the report said. “Once outside, Mrs. Berhalter hit Mr. Berhalter in the face; Mr. Berhalter pushed her to the ground and kicked her twice; Mr. Berhalter was tackled by a passerby, not known to either of the Berhalters; and Mrs. Berhalter got up and left. No police report was filed; no complaint or arrest was made; and no medical attention was sought by Mrs. Berhalter.”The report described the incident as “an isolated event, and we find no evidence to suggest that Mr. Berhalter has engaged in similar misconduct at any other time.”“Based upon information obtained during the Investigation, we also found nothing to indicate that Mr. Berhalter improperly withheld the fact of the 1992 incident, or any other information, from U.S. Soccer at any time,” the report said. “There is no basis to conclude that employing Mr. Berhalter would create legal risks for an organization.”The investigators said “Berhalter’s conduct during the 1992 incident likely constituted the misdemeanor crime of assault on a female” but added “Berhalter is not currently at risk of criminal prosecution for the 1992 incident because North Carolina imposes a two-year statute of limitations for misdemeanors.""Claudio Reyna is a former teammate of Berhalter in high school and on the national team. The report said the Reyna parents had attempted to influence USSF decisions on their children as far back as 2016, “ranging from travel arrangements to the impact of on-pitch refereeing decisions.”Brian McBride, the men's team general manager until leaving Jan. 31, gave the investigators a text he received from Claudio Reyna — a former teammate — on Nov. 21 after Gio Reyna wasn’t used in the Americans’ opening 1-1 draw with Wales at the World Cup.“Our entire family is disgusted, angry, and done with you guys,” the text said. “Don’t expect nice comments from anyone in our family about US Soccer. I’m being transparent to you not like the political clown show of the federation.”Earnie Stewart, who was the USSF sporting director until Feb. 15, told the investigators that after a poor performance by Gio Reyna in a pre-World Cup scrimmage on Nov. 17, the 20-year-old “walk(ed) around, and mope(d) around the whole time,” “seemed ticked off” and “did not appear to be trying at all.” Reyna also did not join other players on post-scrimmage sprints.Berhalter nearly sent Gio Reyna home, instead requiring him to apologize to teammates. Reyna made two substitute appearances during the World Cup, for seven minutes against England and 45 minutes against Iran.Berhalter referred to the matter without naming the player at a leadership conference in New York on Dec. 6. After the remarks became public and it was clear they referred to Gio Reyna, Claudio and Danielle Reyna called Stewart on Dec. 11 and revealed the 1992 incident. Stewart reported the matter to top USSF executives, who launched the probe.A person whose name was redacted in the public version of the report, who appeared to be identified as a travel coordinator for the federation's friends and family program, quoted Danielle Reyna as saying the day after the Wales match: “Once this tournament is over, I can make one phone call and give one interview, and his cool sneakers and bounce passes will be gone.”“Some media reports characterized the Reynas’ actions as ‘blackmail,’” the report said. “As a legal matter, we do not arrive at the same conclusion.""“Blackmail or extortion is the act of obtaining property by compelling or inducing a person to deliver such property by means of instilling in him a fear that, if the property is not so delivered, the actor or another will cause some form of harm to the person,” the report said. ""Based on the facts gathered to date, we do not conclude that the Reynas’ actions rise to the level of or would otherwise result in a conviction for extortion.”Investigators said they “were impressed with Mr. Berhalter’s candor and demeanor during the Investigation” and “we were less impressed with the Reynas’ cooperation.”“It's just about transparency and honesty,” Gregg Berhalter told the AP. “It was very difficult. It was just about being open.”The report said Danielle Reyna initially refused to discuss the matter with investigators during a telephone call on Dec. 29, but she called back shortly later and began by saying: “I did it” and detailed what she told Stewart 18 days earlier.Investigators concluded Claudio Reyna ""used his direct line of communication with U.S. Soccer officials in an attempt to gain advantages or preferential treatment for his children"" and he complained “about his son’s playing time, penalties and suspensions his son received, and selection decisions for U.S. Soccer camps in an attempt to change those outcomes.”The report quoted a 2018 email in which Claudio Reyna criticized having a woman as a referee of a match involving Gio: ""Can we get real and have male refs for a game like this. Its embarrassing guys. What are we trying to prove?”The USSF said the report “identifies a need to revisit U.S. Soccer’s policies concerning appropriate parental conduct and communications with staff at the national team level. We will be updating those policies.”Dan Segal, Claudio Reyna's agent, said in a statement the former captain “tried multiple times to arrange to provide information and to answer any/all questions and allegations.”“Claudio and Danielle acknowledge that they have said and done things in the heat of the moment that they regret, particularly the statement that triggered the U.S. Soccer investigation,” Segal said. ""Gio acknowledges that, like countless players before, he showed too much disappointment when not selected to play at the World Cup.“That is only part of the story here, but the only side of the story that the investigators chose to tell. It is disheartening and grossly unfair to see the family turned into one-dimensional caricatures to progress a narrative that benefits others. ”___AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834061,Divided jury means no death penalty for NYC bike path killer,"NEW YORK (AP) — A split among jurors means there will be no death penalty for an Islamic extremist convicted of maniacally racing a truck along a popular New York City bike path, killing eight people and maiming others.The decision means Sayfullo Saipov, 35, an Uzbekistan citizen who lived in New Jersey, gets an automatic sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole in the October 2017 attack. Jurors told the judge Monday that they were unable to reach the unanimous verdict required for a death sentence.Jurors and attorneys left the courthouse afterward without speaking to reporters gathered in the rain outside. Before he was escorted out by U.S. marshals, Saipov seemed relaxed and shook the hands of one defense lawyer.In a statement, U.S. Attorney Damian Williams thanked the families of the dead and the survivors “for their patience and understanding as the legal process played out.”The verdict was the culmination of a trial that featured emotional testimony from survivors of the attack and relatives of the five tourists from Argentina, two Americans and a Belgian woman who were killed. A formal sentencing date will be set in the future when Saipov can address the court, although his fate is decided.The same federal jury convicted Saipov in January of 28 charges including murder in aid of racketeering and supporting a terrorist organization.It returned last month for a penalty phase to decide if he would be sentenced to death or to spend the rest of his life at a maximum-security prison in Florence, Colorado.Inside the courtroom Monday, victims' relatives observed as Judge Vernon S. Broderick read a lengthy verdict form in which jurors made clear that they unanimously agreed prosecutors had successfully proven that Saipov carried out the deadly act to support the Islamic State group; that he wanted to instill fear in New Yorkers and those who use the bike path; and that he had no remorse.But they were not in agreement that he was likely to be violent in prison despite the prosecution's attempt to prove he would put guards at risk there.They unanimously agreed with nearly all mitigating factors offered by the defense, including that life in prison would be harsh, that the Islamic State group targeted Uzbek migrants and was manipulative in creating terrorists.All 12 jurors agreed that life in prison provides hope that Saipov may one day understand the wrongfulness of his conduct, and seven agreed there were factors in his life, personal traits, character or background or other circumstances that made them favor a life sentence.Prosecutors had argued for the harshest punishment. Some of Saipov’s relatives testified that they still loved him and hoped he would eventually realize the evil of his act.Saipov’s responsibility for the killings was never in doubt. His lawyers conceded he steered his rental truck on a sunny day onto a crowded lower Manhattan path in a bid for martyrdom.Prosecutors said he sped up, trying to kill as many people as he could, and his plan to drive to the Brooklyn Bridge and kill even more was thwarted when he crashed into a school bus. He left the wrecked vehicle shouting “God is great” in Arabic, wielding paintball and pellet guns, before being shot by a police officer.Prosecutors said he smiled as he asked that an Islamic State group flag be posted on the wall of his hospital room.While some U.S. states send prisoners to death row with regularity, that kind of outcome is extremely rare in New York, which no longer has capital punishment and last executed a prisoner in 1963.A day after the attack, then-President Donald Trump tweeted that Saipov “SHOULD GET DEATH PENALTY!”Biden pledged during his campaign to work toward abolishing federal capital punishment, and no federal executions have taken place since he took office. U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland imposed a moratorium on executions for federal crimes in 2021, but he has allowed U.S. prosecutors to continue advocating for capital punishment in cases inherited from previous administrations.During his trial, Saipov seemed moved by testimony from his father and sisters. Otherwise he sat quietly, shoulders slumped, as he listened through headphones to the testimony of victims, including a woman from Belgium who lost her legs, and her husband, who needed brain surgery because of the attack.Saipov turned down the chance to testify. But during his 2019 pretrial hearing, he lectured the judge about the American legal system, insisting he could not be judged for eight deaths when “ thousands and thousands of Muslims are dying all over the world.”Defense lawyer David Patton had urged a life sentence, saying Saipov would then “die in prison in obscurity, not as a martyr, not as a hero to anyone.”Saipov came to the U.S. legally from Uzbekistan in 2010 and lived in Ohio and Florida before moving to Paterson, New Jersey.His federal death penalty trial was the first of its kind in New York in a decade.In 2007 and again in 2013, federal juries in Brooklyn sentenced to death a man who killed two police detectives, but both sentences were reversed on appeal before a judge ruled the killer was intellectually disabled.And in 2001a Manhattan federal jury rejected the death penalty for two men convicted in the deadly bombings of two U.S. embassies in Africa after their lawyers argued against making the defendants into martyrs.The last time a person was executed for a federal crime in New York was in 1954.",2023/3/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834062,Imprisoned Navalny learns documentary about him wins Oscar,"TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — Imprisoned Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny learned Monday from his lawyer that a film detailing his poisoning and political activism won the Oscar for best documentary feature.The 46-year-old politician was attending a court hearing via video link from the prison when his attorney broke the news to him about the documentary, “Navalny,” by director Daniel Roher, according to his spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh. She called it “the most remarkable announcement of an (Oscar) win in history.”Yarmysh did not report what Navalny's initial reaction was to the Oscar win.According to Yarmysh, Navalny faced a court hearing in Kovrov, a town near the prison in the Vladimir region east of Moscow. President Vladimir Putin’s fiercest critic participated in the hearing on a complaint he filed against Russian penitentiary officials.At a daily conference call with reporters, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov refused to comment on the Oscar win, saying that he hasn’t seen the film and thus “it wouldn’t make sense to say anything” about it. He added that “Hollywood sometimes does not shun politicizing its work.”Russian state TV channels largely ignored the win.Monday's hearing was on one of the many lawsuits the defiant Navalny has filed against prison administrators over what he alleges are violations of his rights. Two more hearings were scheduled, but those were postponed until later dates.The documentary portrays Navalny's career of fighting official corruption, his near-fatal poisoning with a nerve agent in 2020 that he blames on the Kremlin, his five-month recuperation in Germany and his 2021 return to Moscow, where he was immediately taken into custody at the airport. He was later sentenced to 2 1/2 years in prison and last year was convicted and given another nine-year term.Navalny has faced unrelenting pressure from authorities. He spent several weeks in isolation in a tiny “punishment cell” and last month was placed in a restricted housing unit for six months. He is effectively deprived of phone calls or visits from his family.At the ceremony Sunday night in Los Angeles, Roher accepted his Oscar by saying he dedicated it to Navalny and to all political prisoners around the world.“Alexei, the world has not forgotten your vital message to us all: We must not be afraid to oppose dictators and authoritarianism wherever it rears its head,"" he said.Navalny's wife, Yulia, also spoke, saying: “My husband is in prison just for telling the truth. My husband is in prison just for defending democracy. Alexei, I am dreaming of the day you will be free and our country will be free. Stay strong, my love.”His daughter Dasha told reporters that the only way the family is able to stay in touch with him is through letters, with defense lawyers able to visit him occasionally. His health is deteriorating, which is worrying, she said.Lyubov Sobol, Navalny's longtime ally, said in an interview with The Associated Press that the documentary's success represented “an important signal that the world sees the efforts to fight for democracy in Russia, the world supports brave and courageous people who have challenged Vladimir Putin and have been fighting the unequal battle with evil, which is now tormenting the entire world and Ukraine in the first place.”“It’s a very important victory and I was unspeakably glad,” Sobol said.Another Navalny ally, Maria Pevchikh, wrote on Instagram: “Alexei, this is your award. It's not about the film. It's about the fact that what you're doing cannot leave anyone indifferent. Be it in Russia, in Hollywood, or anywhere else. (You're) a true hero.”___Associated Press journalist Kostya Manenkov in Tallinn contributed.___For more coverage of this year’s Oscars, visit: https://apnews.com/hub/academy-awards",2023/3/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834063,Ravens release veteran DE Calais Campbell,"OWINGS MILLS, Md. (AP) — The Baltimore Ravens released veteran defensive end Calais Campbell on Monday.The 36-year-old Campbell announced last month he was coming back for a 16th NFL season. He played the past three seasons for the Ravens, and he signed a two-year deal with them before last season.“While this is the worst part of the business, we have not closed the door on the possibility of him returning to our team in the future,” Baltimore general manager Eric DeCosta said.The Ravens have needed to deal with salary cap issues prior to the start of free agency. They put the $32.4 million franchise tag on star quarterback Lamar Jackson earlier this month.Campbell had 5 1/2 sacks — his most since 2019 — in 14 games in 2022. He has a chance to achieve a major milestone, entering the 2023 season with 99 sacks. The six-time Pro Bowler has played 227 games with Arizona, Jacksonville and Baltimore.“Calais defines what it is to be a Raven. He personifies professionalism, and his contributions to our organization — both on and off the field — are immense,” DeCosta said. “With his passion, leadership and toughness, Calais has undoubtedly produced a Hall of Fame-worthy career.”___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/3/14,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834075,How this little see-through fish gets its rainbow shimmer,"NEW YORK (AP) — You can see right through this little aquarium fish from Thailand: Its skin is almost completely transparent. But when the light hits it just right, its body flickers with shimmering rainbow colors.Now, scientists have figured out how this fish — called the ghost catfish — creates its iridescent glow.That glow comes from within, according to a study published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. As light passes through the fish’s skin, it hits tiny structures in the muscle that turn the light into a colorful spectrum.The ghost catfish — sometimes known as the glass catfish — is a small species native to rivers in Thailand, averaging just a few inches (centimeters) long. It's sold around the world as an aquarium fish.Other creatures are also iridescent, creating the shimmering rainbow effect where colors shift as you move. Usually, they have shiny outer surfaces that reflect the light — like a hummingbird’s feathers or a butterfly’s wings, explained Arizona State University biologist Ron Rutowski, who was not involved with the research.But the ghost catfish has no scales, said senior author Qibin Zhao, a physicist at China’s Shanghai Jiao Tong University, who became fascinated by the fish after seeing it in an aquarium store.Instead, it has tightly packed structures in the muscles that can bend light into rainbow hues, which researchers found after shining different lights and lasers onto its body in the lab. As the ghost catfish swims, those muscles relax and tighten, sending off a glinting range of colors.And the very see-through skin, which lets in around 90% of outside light, is essential: “We wouldn’t be able to see the colors if the skin of the fish is not so transparent,” Zhao said in an email.Some species use their iridescence to attract mates or give off warning signals, but it’s not clear whether the ghost catfish's colors serve a purpose, Rutowski said.———The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834079,Italy blames Russia's Wagner group for surge in migration,"Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto said on Monday that the rising number of migrants crossing the Mediterranean is part of ""hybrid warfare"" waged by Russia using mercenaries as proxies on countries supporting Ukraine.""I think it is now safe to say that the exponential increase in the migratory phenomenon departing from African shores is also, to a not insignificant extent, part of a clear strategy of hybrid warfare that the Wagner division is implementing, using its considerable weight in some African countries,"" Crosetto said in a statement.Wagner is believed to be operating in several African countries, including Libya, Mali, and the Central African Republic. The group has been heavily involved in Russian efforts to capture the city of Bakhmut, in eastern Ukraine.""Just as the EU, NATO and the West have realised that cyber attacks were part of the global confrontation that the war in Ukraine opened up, they should now understand that the southern European front is also becoming more dangerous every day,"" Crosetto said.Some 20,000 people have reached Italy so far this year, compared to 6,100 in the same period of 2022, Italian interior ministry figures show.In the past weekend alone 1,200 people reached Italian shores.It is a problem for Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's government, which was elected on a staunchly anti-immigration platform.Earlier this month she called on fellow EU leaders to do more to halt illegal immigration.She said criminal gangs and people traffickers should not be able to control the flow of migrants and warned of unprecedented pressure from the number of people trying to reach Europe.Her defense minister has now called on NATO to help Italy face the rise in migrant arrivals.""The Atlantic Alliance becomes stronger if the problems arising from collective choices are also shared, but it runs the risk of cracking if the countries most exposed to retaliation of various kinds are left alone,"" Crosetto said.He warned that ""uncontrolled and continuous immigration"" has the potential ""to hit the most exposed countries, above all Italy, and their geostrategic choices.""Italy is a strong supporter of Ukraine, sending aid and weapons to help it defend itself against Russia's invasion.In an expletive-laden voice message posted on his Telegram channel, Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin responded, ""We have no idea what's happening with the migrant crisis, we don't concern ourselves with it.""But Italy's foreign minister Antonio Tajani told Italian news agency ANSA, many migrants came from areas ""controlled by the Wagner group.""Meloni's hard-right government policy of treating migrant boats as a law enforcement issue, rather than a humanitarian one has been critcized in the past.Especially after a deadly shipwreck on February 26 in which more than 70 people died.lo/ar (AFP, dpa, Reuters)",2023/3/13,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834080,Illinois enacts mandatory paid leave 'for any reason',"CHICAGO (AP) — Illinois will become one of three states to require employers to offer paid time off for any reason after Gov. J.B. Pritzker signed a law on Monday that will take effect next year.Starting Jan. 1, Illinois employers must offer workers paid time off based on hours worked, with no need to explain the reason for their absence as long as they provide notice in accordance with reasonable employer standards.Just Maine and Nevada mandate earned paid time time off and allot employees the freedom to decide how to use it, but Illinois’ law is further reaching, unencumbered by limits based on business size. Similarly structured regulations that require employers to offer paid sick leave exist in 14 states and Washington, D.C., but workers can only use that for health-related reasons.Illinois employees will accrue one hour of paid leave for every 40 hours worked up to 40 hours total, although the employer may offer more. Employees can start using the time once they have worked for 90 days. Seasonal workers will be exempt, as will federal employees or college students who work non-full-time, temporary jobs for their university.Pritzker signed the bill Monday in downtown Chicago, saying: “Too many people can't afford to miss even a day's pay ... together we continue to build a state that truly serves as a beacon for families, and businesses, and good paying jobs.”Proponents say paid leave is key to making sure workers, especially low-income workers who are more vulnerable, are able to take time off when needed without fear of reprisal from an employer.But critics say the law will overburden small businesses already struggling to survive the post-pandemic era amid the high inflation that has gripped the nation for nearly two years.National Federation of Independent Business Illinois state director Chris Davis said that business owners are best positioned to work with their employees one-on-one to meet their needs.The new law is “a one-size-fits-all solution to a more intricate problem,” he said.Bill sponsor Rep. Jehan Gordon-Booth, a Peoria Democrat, said the bill is the product of years of negotiations with businesses and labor groups.“Everyone deserves the ability to take time off,” she said in a statement. “Whether it’s to deal with the illness of a family member, or take a step back for your mental health, enshrining paid leave rights is a step forward for our state.""“This is about bringing dignity to all workers,"" she said at the signing.Ordinances in Cook County and Chicago that already require employers to offer paid sick leave have been in place since July 2017, and workers in those locations will continue to be covered by existing laws rather than the new state law.Any new local laws enacted after the state law takes effect must provide benefits that are greater or equal to the state law.Molly Weston Williamson, paid leave expert at the Center for American Progress, said the law ""creates a strong foundation for employers to build from while generating a healthier, more productive workforce.”But Williamson added that while Illinois’ law is a step in the right direction, U.S. paid leave laws remain “wildly out of line with all of our economic peers internationally.”“In the United States, federal law does not guarantee anyone the right to even a single paid day off work. Not when you’re sick, not when you have a baby, not when your mom has a stroke. Not a single paid day,"" she said.Joan Van, a server at an international hotel chain and single mother of three, currently has no paid time off.But the Belleville parent leader with Community Organizing and Family Issues said that knowing that she will have five days next year brings a smile to her face.“It’s going to help out a lot of people, a lot of mothers, a lot of single mothers at that,” she said.____Savage is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834086,AP source: Former Jets QB Mike White signing with Dolphins,"MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (AP) — The Miami Dolphins have agreed to sign former New York Jets quarterback Mike White to a two-year contract, a person familiar with the deal said Monday.The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the deal had not been announced.Miami on Friday picked up the fifth-year option on starting QB Tua Tagovailoa's rookie contract, and the Dolphins are bringing in White as a backup. Teddy Bridgewater played behind Tagovailoa last season and started two games as Tagovailoa missed time with concussions.White started four games for the Jets last season after New York demoted struggling starter Zach Wilson. White was 1-3 as a starter with 1,192 passing yards, three TDs and four interceptions in 2022. He missed two games late last season with fractured ribs after taking several hard hits in a Week 14 loss to Buffalo.The Jets are pursuing a possible trade for Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers.White, who turns 28 on March 25, is a South Florida native and played part of his college career at South Florida.The Dolphins also added linebacker help, agreeing to a two-year deal with David Long, according to the same person with knowledge of the deal, speaking again on condition of anonymity because it had not been finalized.Long was drafted in 2019 in the sixth round by the Tennessee Titans out of West Virginia, where he was named Big 12 Defensive Player of the Year in 2018.Before going on injured reserve with a hamstring injury last season, Long had 86 tackles, seven tackles for loss and two interceptions.The 26-year-old Long has good coverage skills and fits well with the scheme of new Dolphins defensive coordinator Vic Fangio, who was hired in January.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/3/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834087,"AP source: Chiefs agree with OT Taylor on 4-year, $80M deal","KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — Jawaan Taylor has agreed to an $80 million, four-year contract with the Kansas City Chiefs to replace Orlando Brown Jr. as the blindside protector for Patrick Mahomes, a person with knowledge of the deal told The Associated Press.The person spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity Monday because the contract cannot become official until Wednesday, when the NFL's new year officially starts and free agents can begin signing contracts.The 25-year-old Taylor started all 66 games he's played in since entering the league as a second-round pick of the Jaguars in the 2019 draft. While he primarily held down the right side of the line in Jacksonville, the expectation is that — much as Brown did when he arrived from Baltimore — Taylor will switch to the left side in Kansas City.The Chiefs used the franchise tag on Brown a year ago, when they could not agree to a long-term deal with his new representative. He wound up playing the season for $16.7 million under terms of the tag, helping the Chiefs beat the Eagles in the Super Bowl, and the sides again worked on a long-term deal.Chiefs general manager Brett Veach expressed some optimism in a contract at the NFL scouting combine.Yet it quickly became evident that the sides were still far from a middle ground, and the price tag to put Brown on the franchise tag for a second year would have cost about $20 million. So the Chiefs, who are expected to lose right tackle Andrew Wylie in free agency, opted to move quickly on Taylor to fill the left tackle spot.He gave up a league-leading 40 sacks from 2019 to 2021, but he experienced a breakout year protecting Trevor Lawrence in Jacksonville last season. He allowed only six sacks and had one of the league's lowest pressure rates among tackles.The Chiefs still would still have a hole at right tackle, but Lucas Niang could fill that role after dealing with a litany of injuries, and Veach has been successful in finding quailty offensive linemen in the NFL draft.That includes center Creed Humphy and right guard Trey Smith, both of them draft picks two years ago, who along with left guard Joe Thuney have formed one of the most durable and successful interior lines in the league.The Chiefs could be busy in free agency as they retool for a Super Bowl defense.They're poised to lose wide receiers JuJu Smith-Schuster, Mecole Hardman and Justin Watson, though there is mutual interest in bringing Smith-Schuster back after a successful season in Kansas City. The Chiefs also must find a replacement for veteran defensive end Frank Clark, whom they released to create some salary cap relief, and safety Juan Thornhill, who may have played himself into a longer-term deal than the Chiefs are willing to offer.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/3/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834088,March Madness is Terry's time at Texas for permanent job,"AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Each Texas win on its march into the NCAA Tournament raises a recurring question about interim coach Rodney Terry: What more must he to do to earn the job on a permanent basis?The Longhorns are the No. 2 seed in the Midwest Region. They finished second in the Big 12, just a game out of first place, and routed regular season conference champion and No. 1 seed Kansas twice in a span of eight days.That includes a 20-point pounding in last week's Big 12 championship game.All that came after former coach Chris Beard was arrested on a felony domestic violence charge on Dec. 12, suspended and then fired three weeks later when the school determined he was “unfit” to lead the program. The charge has since been dropped and Beard was hired Monday as the new coach at Mississippi.But even with all that Texas winning under Terry, the chatter around him still seems to be that the 54-year must prove himself in March Madness as Texas readies for its opener against Colgate on Thursday. After all, that was the benchmark for Shaka Smart, who couldn’t get it done with the Longhorns and left for Marquette two years ago.Terry shrugs off any suggestion that the next game, or two or more are yet another round of auditions for the permanent job. And is it even fair? Texas (26-8) hasn't made it to the Sweet 16 since 2008.If he gets the job, Terry would be just the second Black head coach to lead the program.“I always tell our guys, live where your feet are, live in the present,” Terry said after Texas watched its NCAA tourney draw. “This team has been on an incredible journey. I've enjoyed being with them on this incredible journey. We're going to try to go as far as we can. Really, that's been my focus the entire time.”Texas officials have laid down no public benchmarks for Terry. Athletic director Chris Del Conte has praised Terry's job handling the team in crisis and given him a raise, though only through April. He's also noted Terry inherited a veteran roster and strong staff of assistants built by Beard.Beard indeed built a lineup that would seem to have the key ingredients for a deep tournament run. The Longhorns are one of the most experienced teams in the country with four players in their fifth or six year of basketball.They are especially deep at guard, and play a rugged style of defense that can lock down opponents.“There's no substitute for experience,” Terry said. “Our guys understand the type of urgency you have to play with this time of year.”And it was Terry's steady hand that kept them glued together when the team was watching images of their head coach being led out of jail and wondering what might happen to their season. Texas had to play that night and struggled into overtime to beat Rice.The Longhorns players and fans have rallied behind Terry. After Texas beat Kansas in the Big 12 title game, the players swarmed around Terry to hug and cheer him in front of television cameras.“For everything we've been through, for us to get to this point right now, it's not us,” senior transfer guard Sir'Jabari Rice said. “Everything is RT.”T.J. Ford, the national player of the year when the Longhorns went to the 2003 Final Four, said last week it's time to make Terry the permanent head coach.“Let’s make it official that he’s our Head Coach and the leader of the program,” Ford tweeted.Terry was an assistant under Rick Barnes on that Final Four team. He spent nine seasons with the Longhorns before head coaching stints at Fresno State and UTEP. Terry left the job at UTEP and took a pay cut to return to Austin as Beard's top assistant.Terry is 182-163 overall as a head coach and 19-7 with the Longhorns this season. The Longhorns haven't lost more than two in a row since he took over.“You can be coming off a bad loss or a great win, but he’s still gonna appreciate the day and have a great attitude going into that day,” said forward Brock Cunningham who has played for Smart, Beard and now Terry at Texas. ""And that’s huge.”Terry has been asked many times about taking over a program in distress. He often talks of telling his players they must be able to handle the surprise struggles life will sometimes deliver.And he notes his own emotional struggle of the past year. His father, Calvin Phillips, the man who shaped his love of basketball, died last August at age 77. Terry mentions him so often it's clear he carries memories of his dad with him to every game.“It's a great day to be alive, that's what I tell our guys every day,” Terry said “I really tried to dedicate this season to my dad ... He would be really excited right now.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/14,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834090,"Alabama's Rees, Steele both to make $1.9M this season","TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) — Alabama offensive coordinator Tommy Rees and defensive coordinator Kevin Steele will each make $1.9 million next season.The two were among 11 Alabama football staffers to have new contracts approved by the compensation committee of the university's board of trustees on Monday.Rees and Steele both received three-year deals, with Rees getting raises to $2 million in his second year and $2.1 million in his third after arriving from Notre Dame. Steele returned for his third stint on coach Nick Saban's staff after serving as the Miami Hurricanes' defensive coordinator last season.The next highest-paid assistants are offensive line coach Eric Wolford ($925,000) and assistant head coach/wide receivers coach Holmon Wiggins ($875,000). All the deals except for the coordinators are for two years.—Freddie Roach, defensive line ($775,000).—Robert Gillespie, running backs ($625,000).—Coleman Hutzler, special teams/outside linebackers ($595,000).—Joe Cox, tight ends ($425,000).—Robert Bala, inside linebackers ($350,000).—David Ballou, director of sports performance ($725,000).—Bob Welton, director of player personnel ($255,000).Rees, Steele and Bala are all new hires for Saban, whose team missed the playoffs for only the second time last season. Bill O'Brien left to become offensive coordinator for the New England Patriots. Pete Golding moved to Southeastern Conference Western Division opponent Mississippi to run Lane Kiffin's defense.Bala replaced Austin Armstrong, who was hired as Florida's defensive coordinator shortly after being hired as an Alabama assistant.___AP college football: https://apnews.com/hub/college-football and https://twitter.com/ap_top25 Sign up for the AP Top 25 newsletter here: https://link.apnews.com/join/6nr/morning-wire-newsletter-footer-internal-ads",2023/3/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834091,Tribe to reopen Lac du Flambeau roads in temporary deal,"LAC DU FLAMBEAU, Wis. (AP) — A Native American tribe and a northern Wisconsin town have reached an agreement under which the tribe will temporarily reopen four barricaded roads that are the subject of a decadelong dispute and a recent lawsuit.Officials with the town of Lac du Flambeau on Saturday accepted the Lac du Flambeau tribe’s offer to remove barricades blocking the roads for 90 days in exchange for $60,000 as negotiations continue for a more permanent solution, the Green Bay Press-Gazette reported.On Jan. 31, tribal officials barricaded the roads, which traverse tribal land, cutting off non-tribal residents who live on about 65 properties from the only access for vehicle traffic to their homes.Tribal officials said the easement agreements for the roads expired more than 10 years ago. They argue that the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs and the title insurance companies that handle the properties had not negotiated in good faith to extend the agreements.Tribal Chairman John Johnson had previously said residents had been trespassing on illegally built roads on tribal lands and the tribe needed to safeguard what little land it has left.Gov. Tony Evers wrote last week to the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the title insurance companies and tribal and town officials, urging them to come to a resolution.A law firm representing many of the non-tribal residents sued the tribe on Feb. 28, demanding the roads be reopened. The lawsuit alleges the tribe “took the law into their own hands and illegally barricaded public roadways, despite the fact that they must be ‘open and available to public use’ under federal law.”But a federal judge disagreed with that assertion and denied the residents' request last week. The judge also questioned if the federal court has jurisdiction to issue an injunction on tribal land.Since the barricades went up many residents have been using snowmobiles to travel across woods and frozen lakes to get supplies, but that ice will begin melting soon.Marti Hunt, one of the affected residents, called the temporary agreement a short-term fix.“We have a way out when the ice is no longer safe to cross, but it does not solve the long-term problem,” Hunt added.",2023/3/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834092,Plans for a NYC rail link to LaGuardia Airport now abandoned,"Plans for a rail link were abandoned Monday that would have connected LaGuardia Airport to New York City's subway and commuter rail system, after intense criticism about its $2.4 billion-plus price tag and the potential effects on surrounding neighborhoods.New York Gov. Kathy Hochul accepted the recommendations made by a panel of transportation experts who determined it would be more feasible in the near-term to increase bus service and add a shuttle. Hochul's action effectively means that LaGuardia — in the borough of Queens, across the East River from Manhattan — will remain among the major U.S. airports without rail service.Former Gov. Andrew Cuomo in 2015 proposed the 1.5-mile (2.4-kilometer) elevated link, similar to one serving John F. Kennedy International Airport elsewhere in Queens. The link was envisioned to serve air travelers who currently rely on taxis and car services, and was originally estimated to cost $450 million.Hochul ordered a review of the project after Cuomo resigned in 2021 amid a sexual harassment scandal. Criticism of the plan had intensified by then, with elected officials and environmental advocates saying the new rail would harm the Queens neighborhoods it traversed and wouldn’t be appreciably faster than driving.Democratic Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, who represents part of the area the link would have passed through, spoke out against it, as had former New York Mayor Bill de Blasio.In a lawsuit filed in 2021, environmental and neighborhood groups asked the FAA to request the Port Authority to pause the project, alleging it was pushed through too fast by Cuomo and the Port Authority and used arbitrary screening criteria to pre-empt meaningful consideration of numerous alternatives to the rail link.Some of those alternatives include ferry service, the extension of existing subway lines and optimized bus service using dedicated lanes.In a prepared release on Monday, Hochul thanked the airport's operator, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, for “providing a clear, cost-effective path forward.”""I accept the recommendations of this report, and I look forward to its immediate implementation by the Port Authority in close coordination with our partners at the (Metropolitan Transportation Authority), in the City of New York and the federal government,” she said.",2023/3/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834093,Damon Stoudamire hired as Georgia Tech's head coach,"ATLANTA (AP) — Georgia Tech moved quickly to put a new leader in charge of its struggling men's basketball program, hiring longtime NBA guard Damon Stoudamire as the new Yellow Jackets coach on Monday.The 49-year-old Stoudamire comes to the Atlantic Coast Conference school from the Boston Celtics, where he had been an assistant coach since 2021. The Celtics were in Atlanta this past weekend to play the Hawks.Stoudamire's only previous head coaching experience was at Pacific, where he compiled a 71-77 record over five seasons. He was the West Coast Conference coach of the year in 2020.Georgia Tech didn't take long to replace Josh Pastner, who was fired on Friday after the Yellow Jackets capped a 15-18 season with a second-round loss to Pittsburgh in the ACC Tournament.Stoudamire now heads a program that has made only one NCAA Tournament appearance in the last 13 years.“Coach Stoudamire’s success and credibility as a player and coach at both the collegiate and professional levels make him a great fit to lead our program,"" athletic director J Batt said in a statement. “He will serve as an outstanding mentor on and off the court and will attract talented student-athletes to the Flats.”Stoudamire was a collegiate star at Arizona, helping lead the Wildcats to the 1994 Final Four. He was selected No. 7 overall in the 1995 NBA draft by the Toronto Raptors and earned rookie of the year honors.He went on to average 13.4 points and 6.1 assists per game over a 13-year pro career that included stints with the Portland Trail Blazers (1998-05), Memphis Grizzlies (2005-08) and San Antonio Spurs (2008).Stoudamire said he was “humbled and honored” to land a job with the Yellow Jackets, who won the ACC title two years ago but have largely been a non-factor on the national stage for more than a decade.That's a far cry from the powerhouse program that Bobby Cremins built in the 1980s and '90s, featuring stars such as Mark Price, Kenny Anderson, John Salley, Stephon Marbury and Dennis Scott.The Yellow Jackets reached the Final Four for the first time in 1990, and made it all the way to the national championship game in 2004 under Cremins' successor, Paul Hewitt.“It is an incredible honor to be entrusted with leading such a tradition-rich program,"" Stoudamire said. ""I am excited to get to work with the goal of consistently having our team compete at the championship level that we all know we can and should compete at.”The Yellow Jackets managed only two winning seasons and one NCAA Tournament win over Hewitt's final six seasons. After he was fired in 2011, Brian Gregory failed to make the NCAAs during a largely forgettable five-year tenure that resulted in his dismissal.Pastner left Memphis to take over the Yellow Jackets in 2016, bringing the reputation as a top-level recruiter. But Georgia Tech was barely noticed by the nation's five-star prospects, and the lack of talent showed up in the record.Other than that surprising run to the ACC Tournament title and a one-and-done appearance in the NCAAs in 2021, Pastner's program showed little signs of progress over his seven-year stint.The Yellow Jackets plummeted to 12-20 last season, finishing next-to-last in the ACC with a 5-15 mark. This season, they started 1-12 in conference play — including a nine-game losing streak — before a late run left them with a 6-14 mark and 13th-place finish.Pastner finished with a record of 109-114 at Georgia Tech, including a 53-78 mark in the ACC.The Yellow Jackets have fired their two most prominent coaches as well as its athletic director in the past six months. Football coach Geoff Collins and AD Todd Stansbury were dumped after a dismal start on the gridiron last season.Batt replaced Stansbury and presided over searches that led to interim coach Brent Key remaining on as Collins' full-time successor and the hiring of Stoudamire.Collins was owed a buyout of more than $11 million, while Pastner will get some $2.5 million over the final three years of his contract, putting an additional strain on an athletic department that has struggled financially in recent years.But Georgia Tech President Angel Cabrera expressed hope that Stoudamire can turn things around on the court.“His impressive track record as a coach in college and the NBA, and his own experience as a student-athlete and professional player, will be invaluable assets for the institute’s men’s basketball program and our student-athletes,"" Cabrera said.In an interesting twist, Stoudamire was an assistant at Memphis from 2009-11 after Pastner took over as head coach for John Calipari, and returned to the Tigers for Pastner's final season at the school in 2015-16.Stoudamire also has been an assistant with the NBA's Memphis Grizzlies as well as a two-year stint at his alma mater.In his only head coaching job, he took over at Pacific in 2016 with the program coming off an 8-20 campaign. His best season was a 23-10 mark in 2019-20, when the Tigers won a school-record 11 WCC games and he was named conference coach of the year.But he finished with a losing record overall and never guided the Tigers to a postseason berth.Now, Stoudamire will get a chance to improve on his resume in the ACC.___AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/college-basketball and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/14,,World

(AP) — Operators of the western New York concert venue where three people were fatally injured after a show by the rapper GloRilla say they are “devastated by the events” and cooperating with the city as it investigates the crowd surge that left several others hurt.A statement issued Saturday on behalf of the Rochester Main Street Armory and owner Scott Donaldson said Donaldson has consented to the city’s request to inspect the venue and is confident it followed all city codes.The city temporarily shut down the former military armory by refusing to renew its entertainment license while criminal and regulatory investigations are underway.Aisha Stephens, 35, of Syracuse, Rhondesia Belton, 33, of Buffalo, and Brandy Miller, 35, of Rochester, died and at least six people were injured after being caught up in a crush of concertgoers who surged toward the exits after the March 5 show.Police said concertgoers described hearing what they believed to be gunshots, but no evidence of gunfire has been found. The venue's main arena holds about 5,000 people.“The Main Street Armory, Scott Donaldson, and his team are devastated by the events that occurred March 5, 2023.

The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the contract can't be finalized until the start of the league year on Wednesday.The deal with Hargrave included $40 million in guarantees and gives the Niners a top interior pass rusher to team with AP Defensive Player of the Year Nick Bosa on the edge.The Niners also filled another hole quickly, agreeing on a one-year deal with former first-round quarterback Sam Darnold, according to another person who spoke on condition of anonymity because the deal hadn't been finalized.The addition of Darnold gives San Francisco depth with Trey Lance working his way back from a broken ankle and Brock Purdy sidelined until at least August as he recovers from elbow surgery.Darnold, the third pick in the 2018 draft by the Jets, has been a disappointment his first five seasons with New York and Carolina but now has a chance to revive his career in a QB friendly system under coach Kyle Shanahan.The 30-year-old Hargrave is coming off his most productive season in seven years as a pro with a career-high 11 sacks that helped Philadelphia beat San Francisco in the NFC title game and reach the Super Bowl.Hargrave ranked fourth among all interior pass rushers with 57 quarterback pressures last season, according to Pro Football Focus, and provides a big upgrade on one of the few weak spots on San Francisco's defense that was ranked first in the NFL.Arik Armstead led the Niners interior rushers with 20 pressures last regular season but had no sacks in nine games.The 49ers had been hoping for 2020 first-round pick Javon Kinlaw to anchor their interior after trading away star DeForest Buckner following the 2019 season.But Kinlaw has been slowed by knee injuries that have limited him to 24 games in three seasons and has been ineffective when he played. Kinlaw has 1 1/2 career sacks and was repeatedly pushed around by the Eagles line in the NFC title game loss.Hargrave has been far more effective over his career since being drafted in the third round by Pittsburgh in 2016. He had 14 1/2 sacks in four seasons with the Steelers and stepped up his game after signing as a free agent with Philadelphia in 2020.Hargarve has 11 pressures and 18 1/2 sacks the past two regular seasons for the Eagles.The Niners also kept one of their own defensive lineman, agreeing to a one-year deal with Kevin Givens, who was eligible to be a restricted free agent.Givens originally signed with the Niners as an undrafted free agent in 2019. He played 40 games with 12 starts with San Francisco, recording 57 tackles and three sacks. He had 20 tackles and two sacks in 13 games last season.___AP Pro Football Writer Rob Maaddi contributed to this report___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/3/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834096,Abortion-rights proposal moves a step closer to Ohio ballot,"COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Backers of a proposal to enshrine abortion rights in the Ohio Constitution can begin collecting the more than 413,000 voter signatures required to put the issue before voters this fall, after the petition cleared another hurdle Monday.The constitutional amendment moves to the signature-gathering phase after the Ohio Ballot Board confirmed the petition language contains only one proposed amendment.Abortion remains legal in the state up to 20 weeks' gestation, under a judge's order issued in a lawsuit challenging a ban once cardiac activity can be detected, or around six weeks into pregnancy. The Republican attorney general has asked the Ohio Supreme Court to overturn the stay.The fall ballot proposal would assure access to abortion until what is called viability, when the fetus could survive outside the womb. It also would protect caregivers from being punished for performing the procedure or aiding the process.Ohio Physicians for Reproductive Rights and Ohioans for Reproductive Freedom are aiming to get that proposed constitutional amendment on ballots this November.Under state law, the groups must collect 413,446 valid voter signatures — 10% of the votes in the last governor’s race — statewide, across at least 44 of Ohio’s 88 counties. Their deadline is July 5 to make the Nov. 7 ballot.They say they are aiming to gather at least 700,000 signatures to ensure they meet the requirement.Anti-abortion groups are vowing to fight the proposal and are already urging Ohio residents to vote against it if it makes it to the ballot.",2023/3/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834097,Hertha hoping American investors bring change in fortune,"BERLIN (AP) — Big city club, no more.Hertha Berlin is hoping to shake off the moniker associated with the turbulent last seasons and make another fresh start under new financial backers from Miami.The relegation-threatened Bundesliga club presented 777 Partners as its majority shareholder on Monday, two days after announcing the American firm was taking over the 64.7% previously owned by Lars Windhorst’s investment group.“This is a very good day for Hertha BSC,” Kay Bernstein said in what was his second news conference since taking over as club president in June. “It’s also a very, very good day for Hertha BSC to bury the ‘Big City Club’ label once and for all.”The nickname was spawned by Windhorst in 2019 when he took over and said Hertha, as a club in the capital city, should be on a par with the likes of Real Madrid or Paris Saint-Germain.Instead of seeing Hertha challenge Europe’s best, however, Windhorst only ever saw the team fight relegation and lurch from one crisis, scandal or low point to another over three seasons.Windhorst, who poured 374 million euros ($400 million) into the club, complained last year that investing in Hertha brought only “disadvantages.” His money disappeared amid bad transfer deals, financial mismanagement and the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.Windhorst said in October he wanted his money back after his relationship with the club ruptured over a report that he hired an Israeli detective agency to try and force the previous president out. Windhorst denied the accusations but it was yet another scandal for the club. Windhorst also had disagreements with Bernstein, the current president.Bernstein clearly feels Windhorst's drive to create a “Big City Club” was responsible for much of Hertha's recent upheaval.“This is like a memorial service that allows us to strip off this label and the delusions of grandeur of the last years,” Bernstein said on Monday.Hertha is still fighting relegation, only one point above the drop zone, and 777 does not know yet if it has invested in a first- or second-division club.Josh Wander, a co-founder of 777, said it doesn’t matter.“Our goal here is to help facilitate a long-term sustainable financial profile for the club,"" Wander said. ""It’s our belief that Hertha and all the clubs that we own, that the best way to achieve sporting success is to find ways to sustain yourself for the long term.”The American investment firm already has stakes in Spanish club Sevilla, Italian club Genoa, Brazilian team Vasco da Gama, Belgian club Standard Liege, French team Red Star FC and Australian club Melbourne Victory.Wander said each could benefit from the experiences of the other, but that no one club would be prioritized over another.Wander declined to say how much the company paid Windhorst for his shares because of a confidentiality agreement, but confirmed media reports that 777 was investing a further 100 million euros in Hertha.It will take 777’s share of the company behind the club to about 75%. Hertha will retain the majority of voting rights in keeping with German soccer’s 50-plus-1 rule limiting the influence of outside investors.“Germany obviously has a different playbook from a control perspective than other leagues around the world. And we recognize that going in,” Wander said. ""But we found a partner that we believed we could trust to work with.”Wander added that Hertha gave his firm “a great deal of confidence that we could come into this environment and work as collaboratively as we possibly can within the confines of the 50-plus-1 rulebook.""“The intent of our partnership here is not to be authoritative,” Wander added. ""The intent is to be consultative.”Bernstein confirmed 777 had been consulted in January when the club decided to fire head of sport Fredi Bobic, and on player signings during the recent transfer window.“For me,"" Bernstein said, ""it’s something completely normal to exchange ideas, reflect on perspectives and see what’s the best way for Hertha BSC.”___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834098,"Scheffler on another big run, this one getting attention","PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Scottie Scheffler finally won, and then he kept winning, and the question a year ago was when this incredible hot streak would finally cool.Now comes another question: Did it ever?Even with a green jacket that ended last year's remarkable run — four victories in six starts, capped by a Masters so dominant he four-putted the last hole and still won by three shots — he reached the top so quickly that it was tougher to appreciate it than a slow, steady rise like Dustin Johnson or Rory McIlroy or Jon Rahm.The Players Championship brings a different view of the No. 1 player in the world.Scheffler is on another big run, this one getting far more attention.He won the WM Phoenix Open for the second straight year on a Sunday that featured Rahm, Justin Thomas and Nick Taylor. He was one foot away from a close birdie chance on the 18th to tie for the lead at Bay Hill.And then against the strongest field so far this year at the TPC Sawgrass, Scheffler seized control with a 65 on Saturday and really showed his mettle by turning The Players Championship into a runaway with a five-shot victory.Of the final four groups, his 69 was the only score under par.“I think the team around him and the way he's wired ... he's extremely grounded,” Jordan Spieth said. “He's got really good parents, great family structure. Randy Smith has been around for a long time — his coach — and he's been with him forever. So I don't see it changing. He's in a good position to be able to continue to do this for awhile.”Scheffler was easy to forget last year even while staying atop the world ranking from March to October because the Masters was his last win of the year. Easily overlooked was that he lost in a playoff at Colonial to a 45-foot putt by Sam Burns and was one putt away from a potential playoff at the U.S. Open.More memorable was losing a six-shot lead in the final round of the Tour Championship at East Lake to McIlroy, which cost Scheffler the FedEx Cup.“I had put myself in a position all year to where I had a chance to win the FedEx Cup, and I wasn’t able to get it done,” Scheffler said. ""And by the time I got home, I was worn out. I was mentally, physically drained, emotionally drained.“But the hard times make the good times that much sweeter.”Now he has six wins in his last 27 starts, and 16 finishes in the top 10 during that span.“His top 10s are off the charts,” Spieth said.This stretch of golf could be traced to the Ryder Cup in the fall of 2021 at Whistling Straits. Steve Stricker was torn between Scheffler and good friend Sam Burns for his last picks, which doesn't seem like much of a debate now.While it was an American rout, one of the more pivotal moments was Saturday afternoon when Scheffler made two big putts on the closing holes of a fourballs win that felt like the end for Europe (and it was). Then, he handed Rahm his first loss of the week in singles. That prompted Brooks Koepka to refer to him as a “big-game hunter.”He has a big game off the tee. He delivers with his long irons — nothing was prettier than Scheffler's 3-iron to 15 feet for birdie on the par-3 eighth on Saturday — and his short game is exquisite. As a boy, Scheffler would watch tour pros at Royal Oaks in Dallas and challenge them to money games (coins, no doubt, at that age).He also is bold. One remarkable aspect to Scheffler's game Sunday was taking on every shot, regardless of his lead. He hit driver on No. 6 (with a three-shot lead) and No. 15 (with a five-shot lead). He also went for the green on the par-4 12th with water down the left side. His 3-wood was right where he was aiming, right of the green, setting up a fifth straight birdie.Next up for Scheffler is the Dell Match Play next week in Austin, Texas, where he played for the Texas Longhorns and graduated from business school in four years. He won the Match Play a year ago. He nearly won it the year before, losing in the championship match to Billy Horschel. His record is 10-2-2 in both appearances.And then it's on to Augusta. Would anyone be surprised to see another green jacket? The short is probably yes, because only three players have won the Masters back to back, most recently Tiger Woods in 2002.Scheffler is on another run. For now, the difference is fans have a better understanding why.“He’s obviously just really good at pretty much every aspect of golf,” Max Homa said.___AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/14,,World

Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak with the media.Authorities were first called to the house after a close family member noticed on Saturday evening that one of the windows was open, the officials said.An investigation into the robbery is ongoing and no arrests have yet been made.Salah was the first Egyptian win the English Premier League after joining Liverpool in 2018 from Roma.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834100,"Wife of man killed by Oregon police gets apology, settlement","GRANTS PASS, Oregon (AP) — A lawsuit over the death of a man who was killed by Oregon State Police outside his home in southern Oregon in 2015 has been settled for $1.6 million after a lengthy legal odyssey, the Grants Pass Daily Courier reported.The settlement includes an apology from state police Superintendent Casey Codding, according to lawyers for Robert Box, who was 55 when he was killed by two state troopers investigating a domestic disturbance at his home near Wilderville, Oregon, the newspaper reported.Lawyers for the Box family complained of roadblocks in the long-running case, including an unusual procedural history on appeal caused by the sealing of records in the case by the trial judge.On Friday, attorney Richard Adams and co-counsel David Park released a statement they said Box’s widow, Bernadette, wrote in response to an apology letter from Codding.“I truly hope you take all this to heart and learn from it,” she wrote. “Training needs to be taken to heart. No other family should have to go through what my family has gone through.”On the night of May 29, 2015, Box’s adult daughter Kelsey, who is partially paralyzed and uses a wheelchair, reported she had been assaulted by her father during an argument at the family’s rural home.Prosecutors subsequently absolved troopers Gregor Smyth and Heather West of any wrongdoing, saying Box pointed a loaded .44 Magnum at them despite their demands that he not touch the gun.Smyth fired seven rounds, while West fired four. Box was hit and fatally wounded.Lawyers for the family argued that Box, who had been carrying a loaded gun, had every right to be armed on his own rural property late at night. They also accused the troopers of essentially ambushing him even though they had been notified by dispatchers that his daughter had fled the home and was not in danger.After 18 months of pretrial wrangling, Circuit Court Judge Wolke dismissed the case in 2017. In the process, Wolke sealed records in the case after a motion by the plaintiffs to amend the lawsuit based on new evidence. Wolke’s decision to seal everything in the case was unusual and caused unnecessary procedural problems throughout the appeal process that followed, lawyers for the family said.Last year the Oregon Court of Appeals reinstated the case and remanded it back to Josephine County for a jury trial. The court said the troopers were trespassing when they encountered Box and made several tactical errors in the process.The ruling on appeal put the case in a settlement posture, leading to the agreement last week.According to the family’s lawyers, Smyth was terminated from the state police's SWAT team three months before the Box shooting for a problem known in tactical training as “tunnel vision.”They said the commander of the SWAT team at the time filed a report concluding that Smyth’s “decision making and overreaction have the potential to lead to someone being seriously injured, or killed, on a real-world operation.”",2023/3/14,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834104,"Commanders begin offensive line overhaul with Wylie, Gates","Defensive tackle Daron Payne is under contract long term, and now the Washington Commanders are starting to address their biggest need, the offensive line.After signing Payne to a four-year contract worth $90 million with $60 million guaranteed, the Commanders spent Monday adding depth and versatility with former Kansas City Chiefs tackle/guard Andrew Wylie and ex-New York Giants center/guard Nick Gates.A person with knowledge of the contract said Washington agreed to terms with Wylie on a $24, million, three-year deal. A person with knowledge of Gates' deal said he got a three-year contract.On the other side of the ball, another person said the Commanders agreed to terms with linebacker Cody Barton on a fully guaranteed contract for next season.All three people spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the contracts cannot be signed or become official until the new league year opens Wednesday. Washington did add a player without waiting Monday, claiming cornerback Cameron Dantzler off waivers from Minnesota.“We got a bunch of young talent on our team, and we’re always just one little piece away from being good,” Payne said after signing his contract. “Hopefully we can put together some pieces and make a run.”More pieces are coming into place.Wylie, who turns 29 in August, started all 17 regular-season and all three playoff games for the Chiefs on their second Super Bowl run in four years. He played guard when they won it all during the 2019 season.Gates, 27, brings similar position flexibility after splitting time at guard and center during his 42 games with the Giants over the past four seasons. Adding Gates is similar to Washington bringing in Wes Schweitzer for interior depth in 2020.Wylie is the second player to follow new offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy to the Commanders from Kansas City. Wide receiver/special teams player Marcus Kemp signed not long after the Super Bowl when the Chiefs opted not to keep him.Coach Ron Rivera and Bieniemy agreed the offensive line needed fixing after the Commanders allowed 48 sacks last season, eighth most in the league. The unit could have a few new starters in front of likely starting quarterback Sam Howell.Linebacker was another area of need, whether multiyear starter Cole Holcomb returns following a foot injury that cut last season short. Barton, 26, started 11 and played in 17 games last season for Seattle.Dantzler, who's set to turn 25 before Week 1, was injured in the Vikings' game at Washington last season. The Commanders assume his contract through next season after Minnesota waived him over the weekend.Washington in free agency is still looking for a veteran to compete with, push or fill in for Howell if things go wrong for the 2022 fifth-round pick with just one game of NFL experience. That could be Taylor Heinicke if he returns.There was little doubt Payne was coming back after leading the team with a career-high 11 1/2 sacks. The Commanders put the $18.9 million franchise tag on Payne last month in the hopes of hammering out a long-term deal, and that came to fruition Sunday.“I’m just glad that we were able to get it done quickly and didn’t have to wait all through the summer and all that stuff,” Payne said.It's the second-biggest contract for a defensive tackle, behind only seven-time All-Pro Aaron Donald.“It hasn’t hit me yet,” Payne said. “Probably when I actually see the change in my bank account, it’ll probably settle in. But it's definitely a blessing.”___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/3/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834105,'Fosbury Flop' high jumper Dick Fosbury dies at 76,"Dick Fosbury, the lanky leaper who revamped the technical discipline of high jump and won an Olympic gold medal with his “Fosbury Flop,” has died. He was 76.Fosbury died Sunday after a recurrence with lymphoma, according to his publicist, Ray Schulte.Before Fosbury, many high jumpers cleared their heights by running parallel to the bar, then using a straddle kick to leap over before landing with their faces pointed downward. At the 1968 Mexico City Olympics, Fosbury took off at an angle, leaped backward, bent himself into a “J” shape to catapult his 6-foot-4 frame over the bar, then crashed headfirst into the landing pit.It was a convention-defying move, and with the world watching, Fosbury cleared 2.24 meters (7 feet, 4 1/4 inches) to win the gold and set an Olympic record. By the next Olympics, 28 of the 40 jumpers were using Fosbury's technique. The Montreal Games in 1976 marked the last Olympics in which a high jumper won using a technique other than the Fosbury Flop.“The world legend is probably used too often,” sprint great Michael Johnson tweeted. ""Dick Fosbury was a true LEGEND! He changed an entire event forever with a technique that looked crazy at the time but the result made it the standard.”Over time, Fosbury’s move became about more than simply high jumping. It is often used by business leaders and university professors as a study in innovation and willingness to take chances and break the mold.“It’s literally genius,"" said 2012 Olympic high jump champion Erik Kynard Jr. ""And it takes huge courage, obviously. And took huge courage at the time to even consider something so dangerous. Due to the equipment then, it was something that was a little on edge to attempt.”Fosbury started tinkering with a new technique in the early '60s, as a teenager at Medford High School in Oregon. Among his discoveries was a need to move his takeoff point farther back for higher jumps, so he could change the apex of the parabola shape of his jump to clear the bar. Most traditional jumpers of that day planted a foot and took off from the same spot regardless of the height they were attempting.""I knew I had to change my body position, and that’s what started first the revolution, and over the next two years, the evolution,” Fosbury said in a 2014 interview with The Corvallis Gazette-Times. “During my junior year, I carried on with this new technique, and each meet I continued to evolve or change, but I was improving. My results were getting better.”The technique was the subject of scorn and ridicule in some corners. The term Fosbury Flop is credited to the Medford Mail-Tribune, which wrote the headline “Fosbury Flops Over the Bar” after one of his high school meets. The reporter wrote that Fosbury looked like a fish flopping in a boat.Fosbury liked “Fosbury Flop.""“It’s poetic. It’s alliterative. It’s a conflict,” he once said.In a chapter in his book about the Mexico City Games, journalist Richard Hoffer wrote that Fosbury once received a letter from an LA medical director suggesting his technique would lead to “a rash of broken necks.”“For the good of young Americans, you should stop this ridiculous attack on the bar,” the letter said.As a kid, Fosbury threw himself into sports as a way of dealing with the grief after his younger brother, Greg, was killed by a drunken driver while the two boys were riding bikes. Unable to stick with the football or basketball teams, Fosbury tried track but struggled there with the preferred jump of those days — the straddle.“He just looked at the thing differently, and it really worked,” said Eric Hintz of the Smithsonian's Lemelson Center for the Study of Invention and Innovation. “And he had the guts and fortitude to stick with it in the face of criticism.”Fosbury's biographer, Bob Welch, wrote that Fosbury was fine dealing with people ridiculing his style because, to him, it still wasn't as painful as the sorrow he felt for the loss of his brother.Innovation won out. Decades later, Fosbury's flop remains a hit, and his willingness to take a chance remains a lesson from which almost anyone can learn.“He was as innovative as Henry Ford was to the Model T,” Kynard said. “He’s the creator of what we still do to this day.""___AP Sports Writer Pat Graham contributed to this report.___AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/14,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834117,"Paolo's Diary: March Madness might apply for the Magic, too","ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — (EDITOR’S NOTE — Orlando Magic rookie and No. 1 overall draft pick Paolo Banchero is doing a periodic diary with The Associated Press this season to chronicle his first year in the NBA. This is his fifth installment, where he discusses how this time of year — March Madness in college basketball — has him thinking about last year when he was at Duke and playing for Mike Krzyzewski.)Watching all the conference tournaments, as college basketball gets into tournament time, and Selection Sunday had me obviously realizing how much everything has changed in the last 12 months.This time last year, for me, was kind of life-altering just with the amount of attention that was on us, on me, on Duke, playing for Coach K, and then it kept growing because we were winning and making a run. It was magical. It obviously didn’t end how we wanted it to, but just getting there and the way we got there and how we did it, it was awesome. Looking back now, life has definitely changed a lot since then.But I also get that same feeling now.We still have a chance and that’s motivating for us. That’s where we want to get to. That’s where we want to be. Obviously, we’ve got some work to do to get there. But whether we get there or we don’t, we’re going to finish these last games the best we can. We’re keeping that hope and sticking to what we know, because you never know when you can go on a six-game winning streak.Last year at this time, a six-game winning streak would have gotten us the national championship. I’m super thankful I had the college experience for a year. I mean, not only the stuff I learned, but also the relationships I built and just the fact that I can say that I attended Duke, I played for Coach K, I did these things at Duke, that I’m part of this history and whatnot, how my picture up on the wall over there now and stuff like that. I think all that is priceless. People don’t think about stuff like that, or they don’t know what it’s like being able to go to there and see my picture up alongside other guys. That’s crazy for me. I remember taking my visit and wanting to be on that wall. So now that it’s happened, it makes it all worth it that I was able to go there and do what I did.What we’ve done here to have a chance has also been worth it. It’s my first year with the Magic. A lot of guys in here are young. We’re all young. It’s late in the season and we’re playing games that matter. So, it’s not the end of the world if it doesn’t happen for us this year. That would just mean next year we’re going to have even more expectations and more people are going to expect us to win and we’re going to expect to win. That’s what, I think, excites us and motivates us — where we are, what we can be and where we’re trying to get to. I think this year has been a great start and we’re definitely on the up and up. Whether we make it or we don’t, we’re going to be locked in this offseason and trying to work and build to get to where we want to, which is being a perennial playoff team and contender in the East.I get asked about Rookie of the Year a lot. It definitely matters to me. That was a goal I set before I even got to the NBA, to win that award. So, it definitely matters, but I wouldn’t say think about it too often.Anyone that knows me knows I try to always put the team first and winning first. I’ve done that my whole life and things have always just taken care of themselves. Did it at Duke; I wasn’t playing to be the No. 1 pick, I was playing to win the national championship. Same thing here. I’m playing for wins. I think when you get caught up in awards and accolades and try and start playing for that, that’s when you lose the fun in the game.I’ve always done it the same way. I play as hard as I can.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834119,"Michelle Yeoh wins best actress award, making Oscar history","LOS ANGELES (AP) — Michelle Yeoh has won the Academy Award for best actress and made history all at once.The Malaysian-born actor became the first Asian woman to win the Academy Award for best actress on Sunday night for her multifaceted performance in the multiversal “Everything Everywhere All at Once.”“For all the little boys and girls who look like me watching tonight, this is a beacon of hope and possibility. This is proof that dreams dream big and dreams do come true,"" she said. ""And ladies, don't let anyone ever tell you you're past your prime.”Yeoh's victory comes almost 90 years after Luise Rainer, a white actor, won the same category for donning “yellowface” to play a Chinese villager in “The Good Earth.”As a nominee, Yeoh was the first in the category who identified as Asian. Merle Oberon, who was nominated in 1935 for “The Dark Angel” but didn't win, hid her South Asian heritage, according to birth records.She joyously acknowledged the historical moment in front of reporters in the press room.“I think this is something we have been working so hard towards for a very long time and tonight, we freaking broke that glass ceiling! I kung fu-ed it out and shattered it,” Yeoh said.Yeoh beat out past Oscar winner Cate Blanchett (""Tár""), as well as Michelle Williams (“The Fabelmans”), Ana de Armas (""Blonde"") and Andrea Riseborough (""To Leslie"").The category also received notice for who wasn't nominated: In a year of strong performances from Black women like Viola Davis (""The Woman King"") and Danielle Deadwyler (""Till""), they were shut out. Meanwhile some criticized the grassroots campaigning by A-listers on social media for Riseborough.Yeoh also used her speech to honor her 84-year-old mother.“I have to dedicate this to my mom and all the moms in the world because they are really the superheroes and without them none of us would be here tonight,” she said.Janet Yeoh got to watch her daughter's win at a live Oscar watch party in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.Yeoh added her mother has “has always instilled in me confidence, taught me about love, taught me about kindness and compassion.” She also heeded her mother's last piece of advice.“The recent thing she asked me to do is, ‘Don’t wear pants to the Oscars.’”Yeoh appeared a lock after winning seemingly every award everywhere, including the Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild award, for her nuanced portrayal of Evelyn, an immigrant Chinese wife, mother and laundromat operator bracing for a tax audit.Her win was one of seven Oscars for “Everything Everywhere All at Once,” including best picture and editing. Jamie Lee Curtis and Ke Huy Quan also won best supporting actor Oscars. Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert won for best directors and original screenplay.Yeoh got her start in the kung fu cinema world but rose to stardom in 1992 as Jackie Chan's co-star in “Supercop."" American audiences got to know her even better over the next decade with hits like “Tomorrow Never Dies” and Ang Lee's “Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.""When she first read the script for “Everything Everywhere,” Yeoh thought it was “an independent film on steroids.” She was ultimately swayed by the opportunity to give voice to immigrant mothers and grandmothers who go unnoticed. The multiverse movie was also a showcase across a bevy of genres — drama, comedy, sci-fi and fantasy.At 60, Yeoh has been heavily in demand since her standout turn as a controlling matriarch in “Crazy Rich Asians.” From there, she has done everything from a “Star Trek” spinoff to Marvel’s “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings.”Yeoh will be seen later this year in the Disney+ series “American Born Chinese."" She is also preparing to reunite with “Crazy Rich Asians” director Jon M. Chu for the screen adaptation of the musical “Wicked.”___For more coverage of this year’s Academy Awards, visit: https://apnews.com/hub/academy-awards",2023/3/14,221,World

She was captured alongside Keiko, who became famous in the movie “Free Willy,” and the pair lived together for a few years at Marineland in the 1980s. Keiko was sold to an aquarium in Mexico in 1985 and eventually ended up at SeaWorld in the U.S.Kiska appeared in shows at Marineland for years but had not performed for more than a decade. She spent that time in a large pool at the park’s Friendship Cove separated from a pod of belugas.SeaWorld also has stopped its theatrical shows with orcas and ended its breeding program in 2017, meaning that its current orcas will be the brand's last generation in captivity.The Marineland park told the Niagara Falls Review newspaper that the killer whale’s health declined recently “despite intensive interventions” by theme park employees and an international team of veterinarians.Professionals hired by Marineland have conducted a necropsy on Friday in the presence of province officials, Ross said.Marineland’s owner, Marie Holer, declined to comment.In 2021, the province found that there were problems with the theme park's water system and ordered repairs for pools that house belugas, dolphins, walruses, sea lions and Kiska, court documents show. Marineland initially appealed the order, denying the findings, but later dropped the appeal.The province has inspected the theme park 160 times since January 2020, but has declined to release findings of the inspections.Christine Santos, who trained Kiska for 12 years until Marineland fired her in 2012, said she was in shock about news of the death.“But at the same time I’m just really relieved she’s not alone anymore,” Santos said.Kiska was calm and easy to work with but also sometimes mischievous. She sometimes tricked new trainers into giving “her more fish and more rubs,” Santos said.",2023/3/14,,World

He broke up 15 passes last season, tying for sixth most among NFL leaders in the category.Pittsburgh drafted the former Tennessee star in the third round six years ago and he has eight career interceptions and 168 tackles.Anzalone started in every game for the Lions over the past two seasons. He had a team-high 125 tackles last year, a season after he made 78 tackles to rank fourth. New Orleans drafted the former Florida standout in the third round in 2017 and he has 326 tackles.The Lions announced they re-signed defensive tackle Isaiah Buggs and running back Craig Reynolds earlier Monday, two days before the official start of NFL free agency.Buggs is coming off the best year of his four-season career. He started in 13 games and was a backup four games, making 46 tackles with one sack and one forced fumble. The former Alabama standout started seven games and played in 46 games over the first three years of his career with the Pittsburgh Steelers, making 31 tackles.Reynolds backed up Jamaal Williams and D'Andre Swift last season, running 23 times for 102 yards with nine catches for 116 yards in his fourth NFL season. Williams is an unrestricted free agent, following the best year of his career, and might prove to be too costly to keep.The Lions also kicked off the week tendering exclusive rights free agents: tight ends Shane Zylstra and Brock Wright, linebacker Anthony Pittman, defensive lineman Benito Jones and long snapper Scott Daly.___AP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/3/14,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834123,One loser in 'Everything Everywhere' romp: Oscar bait,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — When Daniel Kwan was accepting one of the many awards for “Everything Everywhere All at Once” at Sunday night’s Academy Awards, he took a moment to assure his young son that what was happening was, to be sure, odd.“This is not normal,” said Kwan, who directed the film with his creative partner, Daniel Scheinert. “This is kind of crazy.”“Not normal” and “kind of crazy” are, increasingly, reasonable ways to describe Oscar best picture winners. Three years ago, Bong Joon Ho’s “Parasite,” a masterful Korean genre movie and class satire, became the first non-English language film to win Hollywood’s top prize. Last year, “CODA,” a modest and heartwarming indie drama released in August, took best picture, making history for the deaf community.If those films set out with little expectation of Oscar glory, the googly-eye-paved road for “Everything Everywhere All at Once” was even more unlikely. It’s not a hard and fast rule, but, historically speaking, movies with butt plug fights and hot dog fingers don’t win Oscars. They certainly don’t win seven of them.As a story about family and immigrant life, “Everything Everywhere All at Once” may be just as sentimental and old-fashioned, at heart, as plenty of Oscar winners before it. But it might be — and proudly so — the weirdest best-picture winner in the 95-year history of the Academy Awards. It’s a long ways from “Patton,” at least.There was much to reflect on what has and hasn’t changed in movies since that 1971 best picture winner during a ceremony that opened with Navy fighter jets flying overhead and saw best supporting actor winner Ke Huy Quan, whose family fled Vietnam as war refugees, emotionally speak about the surrealism of the American dream.“Everything Everywhere All at Once,” for which Michelle Yeoh became the first Asian best actress winner, is unquestionably an Asian American milestone. But for many reasons it’s a distinctly un-Oscar-like movie that, like “CODA” and “Parasite,” never — in any multiverse — expected any of this.“It feels like we’re in our movie sometimes,” Scheinert said in an interview ahead of the Oscars. “At some point we’re going to get pulled out of this joke and be back to our own lives and be like, ‘Oh, wouldn’t that be cool? Too bad.’”Yet it was striking just how resoundingly the blissfully bonkers “Everything Everywhere All at Once” trounced the competition. With acting wins for Yeoh, Quan and Jamie Lee Curtis, it’s just the third film to win three acting Oscars, along with “A Streetcar Named Desire” and “Network.” No film has ever won more “above the line” Academy Awards.At the same time, much of the old guard was either absent or went home emptyhanded. Tom Cruise, whose “Top Gun: Maverick” was nominated for best picture, was a no show. So was James Cameron, whose “Avatar: The Way of Water” wasn’t considered a real challenger. Twenty-five years ago, it was Cameron who was “king of the world” at the Oscars, with “Titanic.”“Maverick” won just for sound, “Avatar” for effects. The puny results for two films that have together collected nearly $4 billion in box office might have taken some viewers out of the broadcast. Academy voters signaled early in the ceremony that blockbusters weren’t on the menu, picking Curtis for supporting actress over Angela Bassett (“Black Panther: Wakanda Forever”), who would have been the first Marvel performer to win an Oscar.Steven Spielberg and “The Fabelmans” was also entirely shutout. Though nominated for seven awards, his most autobiographical film and the one he campaigned hardest for, didn’t win anything. Best director went to the Daniels, who at 35, are the second-youngest winners ever.The Oscars, more than ever, belong to underdogs. And the biggest loser might be Oscar bait.Certainly, many of the winners were conventional academy picks. Best actor winner Brendan Fraser’s prosthetic-aided comeback performance in “The Whale” ticked many of the standard boxes. And it would be unfair to label Spielberg thoughtful memory piece — which somehow lost the “mom” narrative to the Daniels’ film — as awards-driven.But Sunday’s Oscars suggested Hollywood — at least for the time being — is looking for Oscar movies that don’t seem too much like Oscar movies. Some of that could be attributed to the changed makeup of the academy, which has diversified and now numbers more than 10,000. That includes far more international voters, a subtle sea change that likely helped push the German-language WWI saga “All Quiet on the Western Front” to four Oscars and “Naatu Naatu” of the Indian sensation “RRR” to best song.But even the acting winners, while Hollywood veterans, were all first timers. The wins for Yeoh, Quan and Fraser may have all partly been to redress past wrongs to them by the industry. Fraser had been largely forgotten, and a victim of alleged abuse by a prominent Hollywood Foreign Press Association member. Yeoh, a massive star in Hong Kong, had found herself pigeonholed in Hollywood. Quan, an indelible face of the 1980s, had given up acting after years of struggle to find work.The Oscar telecast, emceed by Jimmy Kimmel, was fairly traditional, as the academy looked to quell the drama of last year’s show. So it would be easy to miss that the ground underneath the Academy Awards is shifting — and not just the carpet formerly colored red.But it’s more than a quirky blip when a couple of idiosyncratic, sensitive guys with an absurdist sense of humor win best picture for their only feature film beside the farting corpse one. “Everything Everywhere All at Once,” the Daniels’ second film after 2016’s “Swiss Army Man,” may have struck a chord because of how it channels our dizzying digital overload into multiple dimensions.“The world is changing rapidly and I fear our stories are not keeping that pace,” Kwan said on the Dolby Theatre stage, referring to the speed of the internet versus the slow-moving apparatus of cinema.The Oscars tend to seesaw between trends. The much-debated 2018 winner “Green Book” followed the landmark win for “Moonlight” the year prior. Barry Jenkins' film was the first A24 best-picture winner, and now “Everything Everywhere All at Once” — A24's biggest box-office hit with $107.4 million in box office — is the specialty label's second. A24 swept all of the top awards Sunday, a first for any studio in Oscar history.Backstage at the Oscars, Kwan told reporters that their “shotgun blast of joy and absurdity and creativity” ultimately comes out of his own navigation through dark times and depression.“And I really hope that the next generation can watch a movie like ours and be just, like, oh, there’s another way to look at the bleakness and another way to kind of face it head on,” said Kwan.The victory for “Everything Everywhere All at Once” came as Hollywood and the Oscars continue to find their footing after several years of pandemic and the scandal of last year's broadcast. While the industry has tried to revive moviegoing, originality has been in short supply in theaters. On Oscar weekend at the box office, a “VI” defeated a “III.”But “Everything Everywhere All at Once,"" a mad rush of originality with “Raccacoonie” strapped to its head, is surely beloved for daring to be different. And at the Oscars, its win might not be “not normal,” as Kwan said, after all. It might be the new normal.___Follow AP Film Writer Jake Coyle on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/jakecoyleAP",2023/3/14,,World

The start of production is planned for 2027.The company signed an agreement last year with the Canadian government to work to identify suitable sites for such a facility in Canada. It also had committed to investigate ways for Canada to contribute to Volkswagen’s battery supply chains, including raw materials and assembly.St. Thomas Mayor Joe Preston said it will be the largest automotive industrial complex in Canada’s history.Ontario Economic Development Minister Vic Fedeli said Canada has gone from being behind the pack in the electric vehicle manufacturing sector to being one of the top players in the battery supply chain remarkably quickly.”(It) is a stunning move, and I think acknowledged by Volkswagen that they felt they would want to be in the middle of this whole electric battery ecosystem that we’ve created in Ontario,” Fedeli said.Numbers such as the money being invested and jobs being created will be disclosed at a future announcement with Volkswagen representatives, Fedeli said.The company said Canada offers ideal conditions, including a local supply of raw materials and wide access to clean electricity.“Canada and Ontario are perfect partners for scaling up our battery business and green economy jobs, as we share the same values of sustainability, responsibility and co-operation,” Thomas Schmall, chairman of the supervisory board of PowerCo SE said in a statement.The province of Ontario set the stage last month for the announcement, introducing and quickly passing a law adjusting the municipal boundaries for a 1,500-acre ``mega site″ in southwestern Ontario.Fedeli said at the time that the piece of land had straddled two municipalities, but that it was being fit into one to eliminate bureaucratic challenges of dealing with two municipalities.Canada has seen at least 10 major electric vehicle-related commitments totaling more than $16 billion Canadian (US$12 billion) in the past two years as federal and provincial governments work to attract investments in the sector.",2023/3/14,,World

The person spoke to The AP on condition of anonymity because the deals won’t be made official until Wednesday, when the NFL’s new year starts.The Panthers lost veteran quarterback Sam Darnold to the San Francisco 49ers, but were able to re-sign Bradley Bozeman, a standout at center last season, to a three-year deal. Carolina was not expected to re-sign Darnold after agreeing to a trade on Friday with the Chicago Bears for the No. 1 pick in the draft, which the team plans to use on a quarterback.ESPN reported that Tuttle’s deal was worth $19.5 million over three years and includes $13 million in guaranteed money, citing agent Drew Rosenhaus. No details have been released on Bell's contract.Both Bell and Tuttle are expected to be starters for the Panthers, who are switching to a 3-4 defensive scheme.Bell has started 93 games and played in 109 over his seven-year NFL career, including 48 starts in the last three season for the Cincinnati Bengals. He played his first four seasons with the New Orleans Saints. The 28-year-old Bell has 636 career tackles with 15 forced fumbles and six interceptions since coming into the league as a second-round draft pick in 2016 out of Ohio State.The 6-foot-3, 300-pound Tuttle is expected to play nose tackle in Carolina’s new base defensive front under defensive coordinator Ejiro Evero, with Derrick Brown moving to defensive end. The Midway, North Carolina, native started 33 games during his four seasons with the Saints, including 29 in the past two seasons. The 27-year-old Tuttle has 143 career tackles with one interception and one fumble recovery.The Panthers announced Monday they have placed a one-year tender on restricted free agent safety Sam Franklin that would pay him $2.627 million in 2023. Franklin has the option to sign an offer sheet with another team, but the Panthers would have the opportunity to match.Darnold was a combined 8-9 as a starter in two seasons with the Panthers, throwing 16 touchdown passes and 16 interceptions.

McGlinchey was the ninth overall pick in the 2018 draft. He started 69 games in five seasons for the San Francisco 49ers, helping pave the way for one of the league’s top rushing units over the past several years.Powers receives a $52 million, four-year contract with $28.5 million guaranteed, according to a person familiar with those terms. Powers started 36 games in four seasons with the Baltimore Ravens.Allen's deal is for three years and $45.75 million with $32.5 million guaranteed, a person familiar with the terms said. Allen started 35 games in four seasons in Arizona. He had 9 1/2 sacks in 2021-22.Stidham’s deal is worth $10 million over two years, per a person familiar with the terms. Stidham started two games for the Las Vegas Raiders last season.Amid all the additions on the first day of the negotiating period, the Broncos also made a point to keep one of their core defensive players when they agreed to re-sign inside linebacker Alex Singleton. Their leading tackler in 2022 gets a three-year deal worth up to $18 million, about half of which is guaranteed.And they agreed to a two-year, $6 million deal with blocking tight end Chris Manhertz, a ninth-year pro who played the last two seasons in Jacksonville and is reuniting with Denver's new coach, Sean Payton. Manhertz had a short stint with the Saints in 2016 after playing on New Orleans' practice squad the previous season.The Broncos are hoping to rebound from a 5-12 season in which they fired rookie head coach Nathaniel Hackett just after Christmas, and they'll need Wilson to bounce back after the worst season of his career.That begins with fortifying the offensive line.

Edwards is due $19.5 million over three years, with $12 million guaranteed.The Bears also added to their offensive line, agreeing to a three-year, $30 million contract with Tennessee guard Nate Davis, a person familiar with the situation said.The people spoke on the condition of anonymity because the agreements can’t be announced until the new league year opens on Wednesday.Edmunds gives the Bears the playmaking outside linebacker they've been seeking since they dealt Roquan Smith to Baltimore prior to last season's trade deadline. Chicago made that move after an impasse in contract negotiations.Edmunds had 565 tackles in five seasons for Buffalo after being drafted out of Virginia Tech in 2018 with the No. 16 overall pick — eight spots after Smith was selected by the Bears.Edmunds made Pro Bowls in 2019 and 2020. He had a career-low 102 tackles last season.Edwards, who grew up about an hour north of Soldier Field in Lake Villa, Ill., played in 61 games and made 47 starts for Philadelphia after going undrafted out of Wisconsin in 2019.Edwards had a breakout year for a dominant defense in 2022 that helped lead the Eagles to the Super Bowl. He led the team with a personal-best 159 tackles from his middle linebacker position and set career highs with 10 tackles for loss and seven passes defended. In the Super Bowl loss to Kansas City, he had six tackles and a pass defended.Davis, a third-round pick out of Charlotte by Tennessee in 2019, has started 54 games. He ended last season on injured reserve because of an ankle injury.The Bears set a franchise record for losses while finishing with a league-worst 3-14 record.

The 35-year-old Kelce was a sixth-round pick in the 2011 draft and is a five-time All-Pro.“I have put much thought into whether it makes sense to play another season,” Kelce wrote. “After talking it over with my wife and many other friends and family, I have decided to return for another year. Thank you to all my supporters and detractors for fueling me, I ain’t done yet!”The Eagles responded with a tweet of Kelce wearing a Batman mask from a game last season. Kelce was a free agent and can't officially sign with the Eagles until Wednesday. The Eagles also tweeted a clip that said Kelce was back.Kelce is a big fan favorite and has done it all outside the football field such as singing the national anthem at a 76ers game, partying with the Phanatic and pounding a beer to a roaring ovation at a Phillies playoff game.But the moment that endeared him for life to the Philly faithful came at the 2018 Super Bowl parade when he dressed as one of Philadelphia’s famed Mummers and the ultimate underdog delivered a fiery, profane speech that whipped the crowd into a frenzy.“No one likes us! No one likes us! No one likes us! We don’t care,” Kelce exclaimed. “We’re from Philly! No one likes us! We don’t care!”Kelce made a cameo appearance this month on “ Saturday Night Live ” when Travis hosted.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/3/14,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834135,"For Asian Americans, Yeoh, Quan's Oscar wins are theirs too","LOS ANGELES (AP) — Edward Dion Fariñas watches the Academy Awards every year but the Filipino American didn't expect to have such a visceral reaction when hearing Ke Huy Quan and Michelle Yeoh's awards announced.“I had a squeal come out that I was not expecting,” said Fariñas, who was watching Sunday from his Austin, Texas, home, complete with “Everything Everywhere All at Once” themed pastries from a local Asian American-owned bakery.“I was surprised by how heavily invested I got. It’s not even about the acting. It really just kind of lets us feel like we can accomplish things that normally are not in our lane.”Quan's best supporting actor win and comeback story from childhood star of ‘80s flicks, coupled with Yeoh’s historic win as the first Asian best actress winner ever had viewers of Asian descent shedding tears of happiness — and grinning. The “Everything Everywhere All at Once” co-stars bring the total number of Asians who have earned acting Oscars to just six in the awards' 95-year history.For many Asian Americans, the film's seven Oscars, including Best Picture, feel like a watershed moment — that Hollywood is moving past seeing them only in tropes. It represents an opportunity for optimism after three years of anti-Asian hate brought on by the pandemic.Written and directed by Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert (known as the Daniels), who won best-directing and best original screenplay Oscars, the story centers on a glammed-down Yeoh as Evelyn Wang, a frazzled laundromat owner preparing for an IRS audit. Meanwhile, she is struggling with an unhappy husband (Quan), her critical father (James Hong) and an openly lesbian daughter (Stephanie Hsu).When Yeoh said, in accepting her Oscar, that the award was for children who look like her, the message landed “straight to the heart” said Jasmine Cho, who is Korean American.“Now I’m like looking at when I’m in my 60s,” the 39-year-old said. “I want to be like Michelle. She’s my forever badass woman role model.”Cho, of Pittsburgh, is nationally recognized for her cookie portraits of forgotten and famous Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, and has drawn social media attention for her tributes to Yeoh and Quan. She hopes to give the cookies to them one day because she's been so inspired by their performances and how they've carried themselves.“I feel like they already like completely made history with being like the most awarded film and just all the other awards that they’ve been receiving,” Cho said of the possibility the two might not have taken home Oscars. “So yeah, I would have been somewhat disappointed” had they not won. ""But in my mind, they already won.”Yer Vang, a Hmong American living in Minneapolis, was moved to tears by Quan and Yeoh's acceptance speeches. She recalls coming out of the theater hoping for this scenario. To actually see it happen was “phenomenal.”Quan's remarks about coming to the U.S. as a Vietnamese refugee and living in a refugee camp resonated particularly because that's what her parents lived through.“It's crazy because ... that’s my mother’s story,” Vang said.But all the movie's Oscars (it also won best supporting actress for Jamie Lee Curtis and film editing) mean a lot to Asian Americans, she said. “It does tell the community that we have done enough ... and we deserve to be celebrated, whether in like the highest of courts or just back home.”Norman Chen, CEO of The Asian American Foundation, let out a scream and fist pump for every Oscar the movie picked up. Among the foundation's initiatives are scholarship and fellowship programs with the Sundance Institute. He called the impact of the wins massive.This is going to elevate the narrative ... to create more future actors, directors, screenwriters"" of Asian descent, Chen said.“The recognition is there finally. Just across society, people will be appreciating more even in education with more interest about Asian and Asian American history. It will change the mindset of Asian Americans being foreigners.”Yeoh's achievement was particularly poignant given the history of anti-Asian discrimination in Hollywood. Merle Oberon, a best actress nominee in 1935 for “The Dark Angel,"" hid her South Asian heritage and passed for white, according to birth records discovered after her death. In 1937, Chinese American actor Anna May Wong suffered the greatest disappointment of her life when she was rejected to play a lead role of a Chinese villager in “The Good Earth.” Luise Rainer, who was white, was cast instead. She went on to earn the best actress Oscar.The only previous Asian winners of acting Oscars have been Miyoshi Umeki (""Sayonara""), Ben Kingsley (“Ghandi”), Haing S. Ngor (""The Killing Fields"") and Yuh-Jung Youn (""Minari""), according to Oscar historians. Only Kingsley's was for a leading role.“Everything Everywhere All at Once” hopefully sends a message that those days of perceiving Asians as “meek not strong, followers not leaders” are behind us, Chen said.“This changes that whole mindset for the community — even for our families. I bet you a lot of Asian American families will be more supportive if their kids want to be actors or directors,"" Chen said. ""It's exciting being seen and being appreciated for who we are and where we are.”—-This story has been corrected to state that Yuh-Jung Youn won an Oscar for “Minari,” not “Parasite.”__For more coverage of this year’s Academy Awards, visit: https://apnews.com/hub/academy-awards___Terry Tang is a member of The Associated Press’ Race and Ethnicity team.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834137,10 more people charged in $250M federal food program fraud,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Ten more people have been charged in connection with a scheme to steal more than $250 million from a federal program designed to provide meals to low-income children in Minnesota, federal prosecutors said Monday.A total of 60 people have now been charged in the conspiracy, in which authorities say a group of people took advantage of rules that were relaxed during the COVID-19 pandemic and falsely claimed they were providing food to children. Minnesota U.S. Attorney Andy Luger said in September that the conspiracy was the largest pandemic-related fraud scheme to date.At a Monday news conference, Luger said six people have pleaded guilty so far, and more information is coming about who organized the scheme.“Our investigation continues, and we expect more charges in the future,” Luger said.At the center of the plot, the indictments allege, was a Minnesota nonprofit called Feeding Our Future.Prosecutors said just a fraction of the money went toward feeding kids, with the rest laundered through shell companies and spent on property, luxury cars and travel.The money came from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, with oversight from state governments. In Minnesota, the funds were administered by the state Department of Education, with meals historically provided to kids through schools and day care centers. Sites that served the food were sponsored by authorized public or nonprofit groups.Some standard program requirements were relaxed during the COVID-19 pandemic; for-profit restaurants were allowed to participate, and food was allowed to be distributed outside educational programs.Luger said in September that a small group of people came up with the plan to exploit the relaxed rules and steal tens of millions of dollars by falsely claiming they were providing food to children. Others soon joined, and the scheme grew, Luger said.On Monday, Luger said the defendants allegedly operated fraudulent food sites all around the state, including Pelican Rapids, Faribault, Burnsville, Minnetonka, Bloomington, Minneapolis and St. Paul.He highlighted an indictment against a woman who claimed to serve 2,560 meals a day to children in Pelican Rapids, a town with a total population of only 2,500 people. The woman obtained about $3.7 million from the fraudulent sites she operated, Luger said.Luger added that federal prosecutors in September had seized about $50 million worth of property fraudulently obtained by the defendants. “That number is over $66.6 million now -- and climbing,” he said.Republican lawmakers have said Gov. Tim Walz and Attorney General Keith Ellison, both Democrats, missed opportunities to use their investigative powers to stop the fraud earlier.The governor replied that the federal government relaxed its rules when it sent COVID-19 aid to the states — “as they should have"" — and that his administration alerted the FBI when it discovered the fraud.“Now it’s an ongoing investigation. I guess we’ll get more clarity,” Walz said in October, before he and Ellison won re-election the following month.___Trisha Ahmed is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834138,DeSantis sets execution for 'ninja killer' in 1989 murders,"ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) — A man convicted of a 1989 double slaying in Florida for which he was dubbed the “ninja killer” is set for execution next month under a death warrant signed Monday by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis.Barring delays on appeal, the execution of Louis Bernard Gaskin is set for April 12 at 6 p.m., according to the governor's office. It would mark the second execution in Florida this year after a long pause dating back to 2019.The execution would be only the fourth under DeSantis, a far slower pace than recent Florida governors — and ahead of his widely expected presidential campaign.Gaskin was convicted of first-degree murder for killing Robert Sturmfels, 56, and Georgette Sturmfels, 55, on Dec. 20, 1989 in their Flagler County home on Florida's northeast coast. He was also convicted of armed robbery, burglary and the attempted murder of another couple that same night nearby.He was dubbed the “ninja killer” because he wore all-black ninja clothing during the crimes. Gaskin shot his victims with a .22-caliber rifle, investigators say. Property that he stole from the Sturmfels home — a clock, two lamps and a videocassette recorder — was found at his residence and were intended to be Christmas gifts for his girlfriend.Local media reported at the time that Gaskin quickly confessed to the crimes and told a psychologist before his trial that he knew what he was doing.“The guilt was always there,” Gaskin told him. “The devil had more of a hold than God did. I knew that I was wrong. I wasn’t insane.”Jurors voted 8-4 in 1990 to recommend the death sentence, which the judge accepted. Florida law now requires a unanimous jury vote for capital punishment, although that could be changed this year by the state Legislature.Gaskin, now 56, has filed numerous appeals over the years but by 2020 both the Florida Supreme Court and U.S. Supreme Court had cleared the way for his death warrant to be signed, Attorney General Ashley Moody said in court documents.The state Supreme Court set a briefing schedule for all filings in any new Gaskin appeals to be completed by March 31.",2023/3/14,,World

He was killed by two armed robbers who stole $50,000 he was carrying in a Louis Vuitton bag.There was also a photo of a story from a news website about the shooting, photos from shopping and dating apps, an apparently random photo of then-first lady Melania Trump, videos of one defendant in a pedicab with a woman and a Father's Day greeting.The jurors made their request in the afternoon, asking to see the data from the phones of alleged shooter Michael Boatwright, 28, and the accused getaway driver and ringleader Dedrick Williams, 26, from the day before and day of the shooting.Williams sent and received more than 950 text messages during that time and Boatwright had more than 200. Jurors had to crowd near a projection screen at the front of the courtroom to read them; they could not be read from the gallery.The jurors did not ask for any data from the phones of alleged second gunman Trayvon Newsome, 24, or alleged co-conspirator Robert Allen, 26. Allen testified against his former friends after pleading guilty last year to second-degree murder.Boatwright, Williams and Newsome are charged with first-degree murder and armed robbery and face mandatory life sentences if convicted. Prosecutors did not seek the death penalty. The jurors have deliberated about 15 hours since getting the case late Wednesday at the end of four-weeks of testimony. Deliberations will resume Tuesday.XXXTentacion, whose real name was Jahseh Onfroy, had just left Riva Motorsports, where he had been looking at motorcycles to purchase, when his BMW was blocked by an SUV that swerved in front.Surveillance video showed that two masked gunmen emerged and confronted the 20-year-old rapper at the driver’s window, and one shot him repeatedly. They then grabbed the bag with the money, got back into the SUV and sped away. The friend was not harmed.Allen testified that the men set out that day to commit robberies and went to the motorcycle shop to buy Williams a mask. There they spotted the rapper and decided to make him their target. Allen and Williams went inside the shop to confirm it was him.They then went back to the SUV they had rented, waited for XXXTentacion to emerge and ambushed him, according to testimony. Prosecutors said surveillance video from the dealership, cellphone data and the videos of the men flashing money ties them to the shooting.The men’s attorneys said Allen is lying and that their DNA was not found on the artist. Attorneys for some of the men said that while the money-flashing videos were “stupid,” they don’t prove their clients were actually involved in the shooting and robbery.The rapper, who pronounced his name “Ex ex ex ten-ta-see-YAWN,” was a platinum-selling rising star who tackled issues including prejudice and depression in his songs.

The lawsuit asks the court to force the aquarium to remove “defamatory statements"" from its website and materials, court records state.“This is a significant lawsuit that will help eradicate the damage done by folks who have no clue about the care taken by lobstermen to protect the ecosystem and the ocean,” said John Petersdorf, chief executive officer of Bean Maine Lobster Inc., one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, in a statement.The aquarium says its recommendations are correct based on the best available evidence. It says right whales are indeed vulnerable to entanglement in fishing gear.The lawsuit ignores ""the extensive evidence that these fisheries pose a serious risk to the survival of the endangered North Atlantic right whale, and they seek to curtail the First Amendment rights of a beloved institution that educates the public about the importance of a healthy ocean,"" said Kevin Connor, a spokesperson for the aquarium.Another group, Marine Stewardship Council, last year suspended a sustainability certification it awarded Maine’s lobster industry over concerns about harm to whales.

Such killings often go unpunished in Nicaragua, where many of the settlers are former soldiers.The local indigenous regional government of Sauni As said in a statement that “all of the houses in the Wilu community have been burned,” adding that “families have been left without shelter, food or clothing.”The Sauni As forest rangers unit said the attack was carried out by “70 heavily armed non-indigenous settlers.”The area where the attack occurred, known as the Bosawas nature reserve, is set aside for indigenous groups and environmental protection. But land-hungry settlers want to clear the land to ranch and raise crops. The reserve also has been hit by illegal mining and logging.In January, Nicaraguan authorities arrested 24 settlers after they allegedly attacked an indigenous community as part of a land dispute.That was the first large-scale arrest of non-indigenous settlers after several years of invasions and attacks in the territory belonging to the Miskito, Mayangna and other indigenous groups. However, activists said the settlers in that instance had actually been detained by residents, who turned them over to police.The Mayangna and Miskito communities have been hit by a number of attacks in recent years. Ruiz has said that at least 28 indigenous leaders and community members have been killed in recent years, before the weekend killings.Indigenous activists say the government of President Daniel Ortega has not done enough to address the problems in the jungled region, something his administration denies.Activists say many of the settlers moving onto the lands are former soldiers linked to timber and illegal logging interests.The Del Río Foundation says about 60% of the Mayangnas’ territory has been invaded by about 5,000 settlers since 2015, displacing some 3,000 indigenous inhabitants.",2023/3/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834148,7 killed in capsized San Diego boats were Mexican migrants,"At least seven of eight people killed when two boats capsized in shallow but turbulent surf off the San Diego coast were Mexican migrants, Mexican officials said Monday.Preliminary identification was based on records found with people's bodies when they were recovered, the Mexican consulate in San Diego said in a news release. The nationality of the eighth person was unknown.The consulate didn't provide ages, genders or other information about the people killed in one of the deadliest maritime migrant smuggling operations off U.S. waters. Rescue authorities have said all were adults.A Spanish-speaking woman who called 911 said she was among eight people on a vessel that reached shore and that 15 people were on another boat that overturned. Authorities found two capsized boats in shallow water amid thick fog late Saturday.The Coast Guard suspended its search for remains on Sunday. Survivors may have escaped on land, including the woman who called 911. Authorities did not know her whereabouts.The Border Patrol reports hundreds of known smuggling attempts each year on the California coast. Carlos González Gutiérrez, Mexico's consul general in San Diego, on Monday warned against the perilous trip.“People planning to cross the border into the United States, either by land or sea, should know that human smugglers will take advantage of their need in order to obtain illicit money, distorting reality, creating false expectations, and exposing them to high-risk conditions where they may lose their lives,” he said.",2023/3/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834149,What's the status of the US death penalty?,"The first federal capital case tried under President Joe Biden ended with a split among jurors that means the life of an Islamic extremist who killed eight people in a New York City will be spared. It came at a rare federal death penalty trial in a state without the death penalty.That Biden's Justice Department continued to pursue the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, who used a truck to mow down pedestrians and cyclists on a popular bike path, was a surprise to many given Biden's opposition to capital punishment and his 2016 campaign pledge to end it federally.The jury's failure to reach a unanimous decision means Saipov receives an automatic sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole for the October 2017 attack.The initial decision to seek the death penalty came under then-President Donald Trump, who tweeted a day after the attack that Saipov “SHOULD GET DEATH PENALTY!”But Attorney General Merrick Garland, under Biden, gave his prosecutors the green light to continue pursuing it even though Garland has imposed a moratorium that means no federal executions are likely to happen anytime soon.The federal death penalty wasn't a high-profile issue until Trump resumed them in 2020 after a 17-year hiatus. With 13 inmates put to death in his last months in office, Trump oversaw more federal executions than any president in more than 120 years.Here is a look at the current status of the federal death penalty under Biden:_____HOW WAS THERE A CAPTIAL CASE IN A STATE WITHOUT CAPITAL PUNISHMENT?Saipov's case was a rare instance of the Department of Justice seeking the death penalty in one of the more than 20 states that does not have capital punishment, drawing on U.S. laws that allow executions by federal authorities for exceptional crimes.The death penalty was effectively abolished in New York by 2007, after years of efforts to restore it, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. Historically, over 1,000 people have been executed in New York. The last execution in the state was in 1963.Federal juries in Brooklyn twice gave a death sentence to a man who murdered two New York police detectives, once in 2007 and again in 2013, but both sentences were vacated on appeal. A judge ultimately ruled the killer was intellectually disabled.Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was sentenced to death at a 2015 federal trial in Massachusetts, which abolished capital punishment in 1984. The current Justice Department has continued to fight Tsarnaev's bid to have his death sentence tossed out.If Tsarnaev is ever executed, it would likely be at a death chamber at a U.S. prison in Terre Haute, Indiana, where federal death row is located and where the 13 prisoners executed under Trump received lethal injections of pentobarbital.WHAT HAS BIDEN DONE TO DATE?Biden himself has not issued any formal directives or policy statements on federal capital punishment. During the 2016 campaign, he vowed both to end the federal death penalty for good, and to work at ending it in all states. He has been silent on both federal and state death penalties.The lack of clear steps toward abolishing the death penalty or clearing federal death row using executive authority would leave to the door open to a future pro-death penalty president once against resuming executions by the U.S. government.Under Garland , the Justice Department hasn't sought the death penalty in any new cases. It also has withdrawn requests for capital punishment sought by prior administrations against more than two dozen defendants.The Justice Department announced in January that it would not seek the death penalty for Patrick Crusius, who is accused of fatally shooting nearly two dozen people in a racist attack at a West Texas Walmart in 2019. Crusius later pleaded guilty to federal hate crime and weapons charges.While many have praised the White House for not wanting to interfere in the Justice Department’s day-to-day decision making, capital punishment opponents say that shouldn't stop it from establishing an overall policy on executions.WHAT HAS THE WHITE HOUSE SAID?In an email to The Associated Press earlier this year, the White House said the president “has long talked about his concerns about how the death penalty is applied and whether it is consistent with the values fundamental to our sense of justice and fairness.” It added Biden supports the attorney general’s decision to impose the moratorium.“The DOJ makes decisions about prosecutions independently. It would be inappropriate for us to weigh in on specific cases underway, but we believe it’s important for victims, survivors, and their families to get justice,” it said.WHAT ABOUT THE MORITORIUM?Garland announced a halt to federal executions in 2021, meaning the Justice Department won't issue orders to execute anyone, at least while the moratorium is in place.But the moratorium doesn't stop the department from pursuing the death penalty and it doesn't stop U.S. prosecutors from continuing to fight legal action by death row inmates trying to avoid execution.The Garland moratorium is similar to one ordered in 2014 by President Barack Obama following a botched state execution in Oklahoma. That Obama didn't take more far-reaching action on the federal executions enabled Trump to restart them.Trump officials argued that carrying out the executions was a matter of complying with U.S. law and bringing long delayed justice to victims' relatives.WHAT DOES THE REVIEW DURING THE MORATORIUM ENTAIL?The Justice Department hasn't offered details, including end goals or timetables.Garland has said the review would look at protocols put in place by Trump’s attorney general, William Barr. Attorneys for death row inmates criticized the protocols, saying they allowed for hurried executions.What the review does not entail is an assessment of whether the federal death penalty should be scrapped entirely.WHAT ABOUT THE PROTOCOLS?In September, the Justice Department issued a public notice seeking comment about changes to Trump protocols, including one permitting execution methods other than lethal injection, such as firing squads.In a recent letter, Democratic U.S. Rep. Ayanna Pressley and Sen. Dick Durbin urged the Justice Department to quickly annul all the Trump protocols, including one authorizing the use of state facilities and staff in federal executions, calling the orders “irreparably tainted.""Another authorizes the use of a single drug, pentobarbital, to replace a three-drug cocktail deployed in the 2000s — the last time federal executions were carried out prior to Trump.Most critics of the death penalty responded to the moratorium and review with faint praise — calling it a first step. Any changes in protocol could easily be undone by a future administration.WHAT DO DEATH PENALTY OPPONENTS WANT DONE?They say Biden should draw on his presidential powers to commute all federal death sentences to life in prison, which would prevent those death sentences from ever being restored.There's also proposed legislation to strike the death penalty from U.S. statutes and resentence the more than 40 inmates still on federal death row to life. Biden has given no indication he supports any such measures.The issue is a sensitive one for Biden. In 1994, then-Sen. Biden shepherded legislation through Congress that added 60 additional crimes for which someone could be executed. Some inmates executed under Trump were sentenced under those provisions.Capital punishment has been a hot-button issue politically in the past but is less so now after support for capital punishment has fallen in recent decades. Backing for it currently hovers around 50%, according to most polls.___Follow Michael Tarm and Alanna Durkin Richer on Twitter at @mtarm and @aedurkinricher.",2023/3/14,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834154,Texas Republicans propose state immigration police force,"AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Republican lawmakers in Texas are proposing legislation that would make it a state felony to cross the border from Mexico illegally and create a new border police force that could deputize private citizens, the latest in the state's continued push to test the limits of the federal government's authority over immigration.Civil rights organizations, immigration advocates and Democrats immediately decried the proposals, which began drawing attention after Friday's deadline for filing bills in Texas' ongoing biennial legislative session.“I think the underlying fact that it is going to allow people to question our being American in our border communities and across Texas is unacceptable,” said Texas state Rep. Victoria Neave Criado, chairwoman of the Mexican American Legislative Caucus.Since President Joe Biden took office, illegal crossings have soared. Many migrants have turned themselves in to U.S. Border Patrol agents and were released in the U.S. to pursue their cases in federal immigration court.The Republican proposals in the Texas Legislature would continue pushing Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's massive, $4 billion border mission known as Operation Lone Star. That has included the governor heavily increasing patrols near the border with Mexico, gridlocking traffic with increased commercial truck inspections, and building more barriers along the international boundary, echoing former President Donald Trump's unfished campaign promise.The effort also has included directing officers to detain migrants who trespass on private property and bused thousands of migrants to Democrat-led cities, including New York and Washington, D.C. The moves have put a spotlight on Abbott, who aides say is weighing a run for president.Bills filed this session would allow a newly created unit of state police to arrest, detain and deter people crossing into Texas illegally, construct more and maintain existing barriers between Texas and Mexico and return immigrants to Mexico if they are seen crossing into Texas.State border officers would serve at the direction of a chief, who would be appointed by the governor. According to a draft bill, which will have to pass reviews by both of the state's Republican-controlled legislative chambers before the end of May, the chief will be able to employ licensed state and local police officers to serve on the border force, as well as “law-abiding citizens” without felony convictions.Private citizens employed by the force would be allowed to participate in “unit operations and functions” and have the same criminal and civil liability immunity on the job as the licensed officers. But, they will not have arresting power, unless trained and authorized by the governor, according to the bill’s current form.People arrested for crossing into Texas illegally would face up to 10 years in prison and up to $10,000 in fines for each violation.The proposal cites a U.S. constitutional clause on state powers when facing invasion and imminent danger and follows numerous calls from former Trump administration officials and sheriffs in several South Texas counties for Abbott to declare what they have called an “invasion” under this clause.Neave Criado said language such as “invasion” matters and has been used by individuals such as the North Texas man who drove to El Paso and killed 23 people in a racially motivated rampage.Texas House Speaker Dade Phelan, a Republican, said in a statement that “addressing our state’s border and humanitarian crisis"" was a priority. Phelan said the proposed border police as well as a proposed Legislative Border Safety Oversight Committee, which would provide border safety policy recommendations and oversight to the new policing unit and work on issues in South Texas, were a “must-pass issue.”Abbott's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Civil rights organizations and state Democrats quickly denounced the legislation. The proposal also drew comparisons to a 2017 “ban on sanctuary cities” that allowed police to ask a person’s immigration status and threatened sheriffs and police chiefs with jail time if they refused to cooperate with federal authorities to enforce immigration law.That proposal was signed into law and but was later challenged in court and is pending a resolution, according to Alexis Bay, legislative coordinator with the Beyond Borders at the Texas Civil Rights Project.Bay said the powers and immunity that would be conveyed to private citizens serving on the proposed border force is unlike anything seen in recent Texas history.“It is designed to create racial profiling,” Texas Democratic Party Chairman Gilberto Hinojosa told The Associated Press on Monday. “Something that is just horrendous.""A spokeswoman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection said the agency does not comment on pending legislation.Tensions at the border with Mexico remain high. Over the weekend, video showed hundreds of apparent Venezuelan migrants brush past Mexican National Guard members while trying to cross a bridge into El Paso, Texas, before being blocked by U.S. agents.Authorities said Sunday that at least eight people were killed when two migrant smuggling boats capsized off the coast of San Diego in one of the deadliest maritime human smuggling operations ever off of U.S. shores.__Follow Acacia Coronado on Twitter: https://twitter.com/acacia_coronado__Follow AP's full coverage of immigration:",2023/3/14,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834156,Prominent Kremlin critic goes on trial on treason charges,"MOSCOW (AP) — A Russian court on Monday opened a trial of a prominent Russian opposition activist on charges of treason and spreading “false information” about Russia’s military operation in Ukraine.The charges against Vladimir Kara-Murza Jr. stem from his critical comments about the Kremlin in public speeches that he made in several western countries.Kara-Murza pleaded innocent as the trial opened behind closed doors at the Moscow City Court. If convicted, he faces a possible prison sentence of up to 25 years.His lawyer, Vadim Prokhorov, described the case as “unconditionally political.”""In fact, this is prosecution for criticism,” he said, adding that the authorities have apparently tried to fast-track the trial.Kara-Murza has been in jail since in April on charges of spreading “false information” about the Russian military stemming from his March 15 speech to the Arizona House of Representatives in which he denounced Russia’s military action in Ukraine. The investigators added the charges of treason against him while he was in custody.Russia adopted a law criminalizing spreading “false information” about its military shortly after Russian troops rolled into Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. Authorities have used the law to stifle criticism of what the Kremlin calls “a special military operation.”Kara-Murza, a journalist, was an associate of opposition leader Boris Nemtsov, who was killed near the Kremlin in 2015. He himself survived poisonings in 2015 and 2017 that he blamed on the Kremlin. Russian officials have denied responsibility.",2023/3/14,,World

Particularly, McNally supported legislation restricting where certain drag shows can take place.Some of the posts that have sparked the most uproar include commenting on a photo of the man's backside, where he was wearing only underwear, saying “you can turn a rainy day into rainbow and sunshine.” McNally then posted a comment using only heart and fire emojis. In a separate post, McNally posted a heart emoji of the man pulling down his underwear.“While I see now that I should have been more careful about how my comments and activity would be perceived, my intent was always engagement and encouragement,” McNally said in a statement. “For this reason, I will be pausing my social media activity in order to reflect and receive more guidance on the use of social media.”McNally added while he may have made “some mistakes,"" he disagreed that he had a record of being “anti-gay"" and pointed to his opposition of a 2020 law that assured continued taxpayer funding of faith-based foster care and adoption agencies even if those organizations exclude LGBTQ families and others based on religious beliefs.Yet McNally then pointed to his support of “traditional marriage” and support of bills that “keep obscenity out of the public sphere.”“There is no contradiction here,” he said.McNally, who is from Oak Ridge, became lieutenant governor in 2017. He has been a state lawmaker since the late 1970s.",2023/3/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834171,Michigan State women's hoops coach Suzy Merchant steps down,"EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) — Suzy Merchant has stepped down as Michigan State's women's basketball coach, citing health concerns.“After much consideration and consultation with my health care providers, I have come to the difficult decision that it is in my best interest,” Merchant said in a statement released by the school on Monday.The 53-year-old Merchant had not coached the Spartans since she was in a one-car crash after a medical incident in late January. Six seasons ago, she fainted and collapsed onto the court during a game and doctors later discovered she had a heart abnormality.Associate head coach Dean Lockwood, who filled in for Merchant this season, will serve as the team's interim coach while the school searches for a new leader for the program.Merchant had a five-year rollover contract with a base salary of $700,000.The 2011 Big Ten coach of the year won two Big Ten titles, earned 10 NCAA Tournament bids and reached the Sweet 16 in 2019. She was 327-186 over 16 seasons with the Spartans and 528-306 overall, including her records at Eastern Michigan and Saginaw Valley State.Merchant, who is from Traverse City, was a four-year starter and three-time captain for Central Michigan's basketball team.“I would like to extend a special appreciation to (former athletic director) Mark Hollis and (former school president) Dr. Lou Anna Simon for giving a small-town kid from Northern Michigan the chance of a lifetime to live my dream as a Spartan,” Merchant said. “I’m eternally grateful.""___AP women’s college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/womens-college-basketball and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834172,Abortion pill hearing made public after transparency concern,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A judge is set to hear arguments this week in a lawsuit that poses a threat to the nationwide availability of medication abortion. The upcoming hearing became public Monday after reporting raised concerns that the case with major implications could unfold with little public oversight.The intensely watched lawsuit challenges the Food and Drug Administration’s approval of the drug mifepristone in 2000 and was filed by a group that helped challenge Roe v. Wade. It’s been assigned to a Texas judge who was appointed by former President Donald Trump and is known for conservative views.The ruling could affect states regardless of whether abortion is legal and comes as medication accounts for over half of abortions. The impacts of a ruling against the Food and Drug Administration could take years to play out.The hearing set for Wednesday was first revealed by the Washington Post, which reported that U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk would delay putting it on the public docket to minimize threats and possible protests. He also asked the attorneys not to publicly discuss details of the plans, the newspaper reported.There is a presumption of openness in federal court proceedings, meaning proceedings are open to the public except in rare exceptions, and transparency in the court system is a keystone of the American judicial system. Delaying public notice of a hearing is highly unusual because it would normally be quickly placed on the public court docket.Many court hearings are scheduled weeks or months in advance and quickly added to the public docket.Still, there appears to be no national policy or rules on hearing notification, and judges have a great deal of discretion over many aspects of how cases are run, according to Charles Hall, a spokesperson for the Administrative Office of the U.S Courts. The Northern District of Texas, where the case is being heard, does not have any local rules mandating deadlines for hearing notifications.The court's official webpage for Kacsmaryk indicates he’s typically inclined to openness and “heavily disfavor(s)” sealing information.A coalition of media outlets filed a motion protesting the delayed notification, saying it would amount to an indirect closure of the courtroom. The case is being heard in Amarillo, a city in the Texas Panhandle that’s hours away from major cities.The motion notes the judge has expressed concerns about security, but media lawyers argued the courthouse can be secured without closing the courtroom. The U.S. Marshals Service, which is responsible for federal judicial security, has long secured courtrooms in untold numbers of closely watched, emotionally charged and potentially dangerous cases.“Courts are supposed to be open to the public, and only in extraordinary circumstances do you seal documents or hide a hearing,” said David Cohen, a law professor at Drexel University in Philadelphia. In this case, Cohen said, “it just doesn’t seem like there’s anything here that meets those requirements.”The United States Department of Justice, which is representing the Food and Drug Administration, initially declined to provide even basic details about the high-profile hearing. That position raised questions about whether it is fulfilling a commitment by Attorney General Merrick Garland and other senior officials that it would be transparent and accountable to the American public. The White House referred questions back to the Justice Department.The admonition from the judge not to discuss the plans publicly meant confirmation could have risked his displeasure, though a contempt holding would be less likely, Cohen said.",2023/3/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834173,"Doncic, Irving out again as Mavs lose rematch with Memphis","DALLAS (AP) — Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving missed another loss to Memphis with the Dallas Mavericks getting tight on time to secure a playoff berth a year after a trip to the Western Conference finals.Doncic and Irving sat out the finale of a home-and-home with the Grizzlies, who won 104-88 on Monday night. Doncic is dealing with a left thigh strain that required an MRI, and Irving has a sore right foot.The Mavericks are a game under .500 for the first time since December — at risk of landing in the West play-in tournament or out of the postseason all together.Dallas coach Jason Kidd said he hoped Doncic could practice Tuesday before the start of a three-game trip. But he offered a vague “day-to-day” on all specific questions about the injuries to the 24-year-old star and his new sidekick, the eight-time All-Star Irving.“If we can get healthy, we feel that we can do a lot in the playoffs,” Kidd said before the game. “But first, you've got to get to the playoffs. We we've got to win some games here.”The All-Star pair of Doncic and Irving sat out a 112-108 loss in Memphis on Saturday night. They were joined on the sideline Monday by forward Christian Wood, who has a sore right foot.The Grizzlies were without star point guard Ja Morant for a fifth consecutive game because of his issues off the court.Morant is away from the team after posting a video last weekend in which he appeared to be displaying a gun at a Denver-area strip club.Doncic's MRI showed no significant damage to his thigh, which has been bothering him for two weeks. He was getting the thigh treated during games while continuing to play before finally leaving and not returning in a 113-106 loss at New Orleans last week.The injuries have slowed the process of Doncic and Irving learning to play together since the blockbuster trade that brought Irving from Brooklyn last month and gave Dallas two All-Star starters for the first time in franchise history.Phoenix has a similar scenario after acquiring Kevin Durant days after the Mavs' deal for Irving. Durant is out until late in the regular season after injuring an ankle in pregame warmups last week.“There are a lot of us in the West that are trying to figure it out, and whoever can figure it out first will be in a better place,” Kidd said. “We feel that we are one of those teams that can figure it out. But again, health is a part of this.”___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834174,"AP sources: Falcons to sign Jessie Bates, get Jonnu Smith","The Atlanta Falcons have agreed to a four-year, $64 million contract with safety Jessie Bates, a person familiar with the deal told The Associated Press.The person spoke on condition of anonymity Monday because the deal can’t be announced until Wednesday.The Falcons also agreed to acquire tight end Jonnu Smith from the New England Patriots, according to another person familiar with that deal. The Falcons are sending a seventh-round pick to New England, per NFL Network.Atlanta announced that Pro Bowl guard Chris Lindstrom has signed a five-year contract extension, reportedly making him the NFL’s highest-paid guard.ESPN reported the deal, which will keep Lindstrom with the Falcons through the 2028 season, is worth $105 million. It locks up another key member of the offensive line, with left tackle Jake Matthews under contract through 2026.Lindstrom’s average of $21 million per season surpasses Indianapolis guard Quenton Nelson’s $20.2 million annual average.Bates started 79 games in five seasons with the Cincinnati Bengals. Bates had 14 interceptions, forced three fumbles and recovered two. He was a second-team All-Pro in 2020.Smith had 27 catches for 245 yards last year. He had his best season in 2020 for Tennessee under Falcons coach Arthur Smith, who was the Titans’ offensive coordinator that season. Smith had 41 receptions for 448 yards and eight TDs that season.The 26-year-old Lindstrom, a second-team All-Pro in 2022, was Atlanta’s top pick in 2019 out of Boston College. He has started 55 games over his four-year career, only missing time when he went down with a broken foot as a rookie.Lindstrom was selected to his first Pro Bowl this past season after starting all 17 games at right guard and anchoring a line that opened up holes for the third-best rushing attack in the NFL. The Falcons averaged 159.9 yards per game on the ground.Pro Football Focus said Lindstrom led all offensive players with a 95.0 grade. He was PFF’s top-graded offensive lineman during four weeks this past season.Lindstrom has been called for only one holding penalty in his career.The contract extension for Lindstrom is expected to be part of a big spending spree by the Falcons, who went into free agency with roughly $50 million of cap space.Atlanta is looking to make a big move in 2023 after five straight losing seasons.___AP Sports Writer Paul Newberry contributed to this report.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/3/14,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834177,Audience for 95th Oscars rebounds slightly to 18.7 million,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Whether it was the lingering drama of The Slap or the prominence of blockbusters in the best picture race, a bigger audience was lured back to the Oscars this year.The 95th Academy Awards, which aired Sunday night on ABC, was viewed by an estimated 18.7 million, according to preliminary Fast National Live+Same Day numbers released Monday by ABC. That's up 12% from last year's show, but still low compared to most years.The evening’s main counterprogramming, the season finale of “The Last of Us” pulled in 8.2 million viewers across HBO and HBO Max. The show began at 9 p.m. EDT, an hour after the Oscars started.A frequent criticism of the Oscars is that the show celebrates films that don’t have wide appeal. This year was markedly different, however, with two billion-dollar blockbuster sequels in the mix: “Top: Gun Maverick” and “Avatar: The Way of Water” were both nominated for best picture. Angela Bassett was nominated for a Marvel movie, a first. Even the winning film, A24’s “Everything Everywhere All At Once,” made over $100 million at the global box office and played in theaters for months.For many years, the Oscars were often the second most-watched television program of the year behind the Super Bowl. Until 2018, the Oscar telecast had never slipped below 30 million viewers, according to Nielsen records. The high-water mark was the 55 million people who watched “Titanic” clean up in 1998.From the 43.7 million who watched in 2014, viewership declined steadily to 26.5 million in 2018, then went back up to 29.6 million in 2019, and 23.6 million in 2020. The bottom fell out with the pandemic-diminished show in 2021, seen by 9.85 million. It rebounded last year to 16.6 million, which was the second lowest-rated show ever.Jimmy Kimmel, who presided over the ceremony in 2017 and 2018, returned to host the show, parachuting on to the Dolby Theatre stage. The show also featured performances from pop stars like Rihanna and Lady Gaga.Broadcast television viewership has gone down across the board in the streaming era, and awards shows have illustrated that. The show boasted 27.4 million total social interactions across Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and YouTube and was the No. 1 worldwide trending topic on Twitter for its duration.By Monday afternoon, Ke Huy Quan’s acceptance speech had over 1.3 million views on YouTube, and Brendan Fraser’s was up to 2.6 million.The ABC broadcast also had 1.8 million views of the American Sign Language live stream.“What we wanted to do was go out and execute a show that people would really like and a show people would talk about,” Oscars producer Glenn Weiss told The Hollywood Reporter in the hours after the show. “We think we did accomplish that. I sure hope that (Monday) delivers good news in the ratings front, but either way, I think it was a successful evening.”___For more coverage of this year’s Academy Awards, visit: https://apnews.com/hub/academy-awards",2023/3/14,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834180,"Signature Bank seized to send banks a message, director says","A regulatory takeover of a New York-based bank was intended to send a message to U.S. banks to stay away from the cryptocurrency business, a former member of Congress who was on the bank’s board says.Former U.S. Rep. Barney Frank said Monday that he believes the state officials behind the action were trying to make an example of Signature Bank in takeover that he said was the wrong move. Despite a wave of withdrawals, the bank's situation was under control before regulators swooped in, he said.“This was just a way to tell people, ‘We don’t want you dealing with crypto,’” Frank said in an interview.Frank, a Democrat who served in Congress from 1981 until 2013, coauthored the Dodd-Frank act that boosted government oversight of banks following the 2008 financial crisis.He was a director at Signature Bank until the New York Division of Financial Services took it over Sunday and gave control of it to the FDIC, the federal agency that insures bank deposits, until the bank can be sold.Frank said the bank's former operators have no recourse. But he said he expects some vindication when Signature is sold eventually.“I believe they’re going to get a very good price,” Frank said, “proof that it was not a bank problem.”Signature's takeover came two days after regulators seized California-based Silicon Valley Bank. Both followed a rush of withdrawals from the banks, which catered to technology businesses.New York Gov. Kathy Hochul described the takeover as a way to avert a bigger crisis that could have affected more banks.“Our view was to make sure that the entire banking community here in New York was stable, that we can project calm,” Hochul said in a news conference Monday.Signature, which was founded more than two decades ago, has about 40 offices across the U.S. and says it focuses on banking for privately owned businesses, their owners and senior managers.The bank said it was the first FDIC-insured bank to launch a blockchain-based digital payments platform.As worries mounted about Silicon Valley Bank last week, Signature put out a statement seeking to reassure clients and investors that it was stable. The statement included a reminder that despite its efforts to cater to cryptocurrency holders, it “does not invest in, does not trade, does not hold, does not custody and does not lend against or make loans collateralized by digital assets.”But by Friday, there were more withdrawals, which Frank said were “based solely on the contagion from SVB.”He said the situation had stabilized by the time Sunday that New York regulators took it over.The bank had more than $110 billion in assets, making it the third-largest banking failure in U.S. history.Unlike Frank, Hochul did not point to cryptocurrency as a factor in the bank's shuttering over the weekend. She said withdrawals were continuing, making the action necessary.And the state regulator went even further, saying Signature wasn't a crypto bank.“This is not about a particular sector in the case of Signature Bank, but we moved quickly to make sure depositors were protected,” said New York Financial Services Superintendent Adrienne Harris.The bank's top executives were ousted and it reopened Monday under operational control of the FDIC as Signature Bridge Bank.Also Monday, the FDIC announced that those with deposits in both banks would have full access to them — even the amounts that exceed the regular $250,000 insurance limit.Frank said that if the FDIC had agreed to insure the entire deposits on Friday rather than waiting until Monday, Signature would not have been taken over. He said the insurance limit for businesses should also be raised permanently by Congress to an amount high enough to cover a few months' worth of payroll for most firms.___Mulvihill reported from Cherry Hill, New Jersey.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834181,United sees 1Q loss on cost of potential contract for pilots,"CHICAGO (AP) — United Airlines said Monday it will lose up to $1 a share in the first quarter after accounting for some of the cost of a potential new contract with pilots.Wall Street was expecting United to post a first-quarter profit on the back of strong travel demand, and United shares fell 6% in after-hours trading.United is still negotiating with its pilots, who are eager to match a recently ratified contract that will give Delta pilots cumulative raises averaging 34% over four years. United said in a regulatory filing that it will book the expense for a new agreement in the first quarter instead of the second quarter.The airline now expects to lose between 60 cents and $1 per share. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had been predicting a profit of 60 cents per share. United forecast earnings of 50 cents to $1 per share in January.The Chicago-based airline said demand for flights remains strong. It expects first-quarter operating revenue to be up 51% from a year earlier, one point higher than the previously forecast increase.",2023/3/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834182,Nicaragua pitcher signs with MLB's Tigers after 1 WBC inning,"MIAMI (AP) — Duque Hebbert turned just one inning of work in the World Baseball Classic into a contract.The 21-year-old pitcher for Nicaragua entered Monday's game against the Dominican Republic in the ninth inning and struck out All-Stars Juan Soto, Julio Rodríguez and Rafael Devers.That feat impressed the Detroit Tigers enough to offer Hebbert a minor league contract after the game.After striking out Soto and Rodríguez to start the inning, Hebbert gave up a double to Manny Machado, who also had a home run in the game. Hebbert struck out Devers on a changeup immediately after.“Extraordinary,” Nicaragua manager Sandor Guido said. ""That’s one of the positive parts of the game. That young guy is under 23. He showed what he is made of when you have will, when you have heart, you can do very good things.“He came and he faced the best players of the team. ... It’s a good experience for him, and he is going to improve.”The Dominican Republic won the game 6-1, dropping Nicaragua to 0-3 in WBC pool play.___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/14,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834184,Late Morata goal gives Atletico Madrid key win over Girona,"MADRID (AP) — It took Álvaro Morata and his Atletico Madrid teammates more than three minutes to be able to celebrate the striker's important winner against Girona in the Spanish league on Monday.Morata's goal early in second half stoppage time was confirmed only after a lengthy video review, but it finally counted to give Atletico the 1-0 win and sole possession of third place.Atletico entered the match tied on points with Real Sociedad, which on Sunday was held at Mallorca to 1-1. Diego Simeone’s team was still eight points behind second-placed Real Madrid, and 17 behind league leader Barcelona.Morata scored from close range after charging toward the far post following a corner kick cross by Antoine Griezmann from the right side. The ball was deflected inside the area before Morata could get to it near the goalline. The assistant raised the flag for offside but the goal eventually stood after being confirmed by the VAR.Morata said his teammates were initially upset with him because it appeared the ball could have gone in even if he hadn't touch it.“To me it was clear, but if they didn't confirm it I think I would have had to go back home on a bicycle,"" Morata said. ""They (my teammates) were mad at me because I touched it. But I didn't know if it was going in or not. So just in case I had to finish the play. It was hard to see the ball there and not push it in.”Morata scored twice in Atletico's 6-1 rout of Sevilla in the previous round. Until then, he'd been scoreless in five straight games.Atletico celebrated a sixth win in its last eight league games, with two draws. It next hosts relegation-threatened Valencia.It was the second loss in a row for Girona, which stayed in 12th place, four points above the relegation zone. It next visits seventh-place Rayo Vallecano.Girona's 36-year-old Uruguayan striker Cristhian Stuani came off the bench in the second half to make his 200th appearance with the Catalan club.___Tales Azzoni on Twitter: http://twitter.com/tazzoni___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/14,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834187,Sheriff: Missing Texas girl found locked in NC outbuilding,"LEXINGTON, N.C. (AP) — A missing 13-year-old Texas girl was found locked in an outbuilding near a North Carolina home, authorities said Monday.Investigators with the Dallas police and the FBI say a 34-year-old man enticed the girl to leave her home while communicating with her on social media, then picked her up in his vehicle, Sheriff Richie Simmons said at a news conference in Davidson County, North Carolina.Video cameras near the girl’s house filmed a vehicle registered to an address in Davidson County, and a special agent with the Texas FBI Violent Crimes Task Force contacted the sheriff’s office there on Friday, officials said in a news release.“Within 10 minutes our guys had eyes on that residence,” Capt. Stephanie Murphy said. ""Everything moved fairly quickly after that.”Investigators found the vehicle and conducted a traffic stop on the owner as he left the home, officials said. During the stop, they figured out that the girl was locked in an outbuilding on the property in Lexington, where she was found. She was taken for medical evaluation and eventually returned to Texas, officials said.The man, identified as Jorge Ivan Santos Camacho, was taken into custody and charged with abduction, felonious restraint, human trafficking, statutory rape, statutory sex offense and indecent liberties. He was being held on $1.25 million secure bond. Attorney Corey Buggs was appointed to represent Camacho at a hearing Monday, according to court records. Buggs did not immediately respond to a phone message seeking comment.",2023/3/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834188,AP source: Jets re-signing K Greg Zuerlein,"The New York Jets are re-signing kicker Greg Zuerlein, a person with knowledge of the deal said Monday.Zuerlein won a training camp competition last summer with Eddy Pineiro and had a solid first season with the Jets, including kicking a franchise-record 60-yard field goal.After a few years of inconsistency at the kicker spot, the Jets made re-signing the steady Zuerlein a priority in free agency. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the team hadn't announced the deal.ESPN first reported the agreement between Zuerlein and the Jets. Terms of the deal weren't immediately available.While the Jets continue to wait for quarterback Aaron Rodgers to decide on his playing future and if he would approve a trade to New York, they have begun to shore up other areas of the roster.The Jets agreed to terms on a trade with Baltimore last Thursday to acquire safety Chuck Clark. They also re-signed linebacker Quincy Williams to a three-year deal on Sunday.The 35-year-old Zuerlein, who signed a one-year contract with the Jets last March, went 30 of 37 on field goal attempts — including 6 of 11 from 50 or more yards. He was 5 for 5 at Minnesota in Week 13, including the 60-yarder. Zuerlein also converted 28 of his 29 extra-point attempts.That came after the Jets went through seven kickers in the previous three seasons.Zuerlein was a sixth-round pick of the Rams in 2012 out of Missouri Western State. He has one of the strongest kicking legs in the league and had a career-best 61-yard field goal in 2015. Zuerlein was a first-team All-Pro two years later, when he also made his only Pro Bowl while making 38 of 40 field goal tries.He was signed to a three-year deal by Dallas as a free agent in 2020, but was cut by the Cowboys last March.For his career, Zuerlein has made 82.1% of his field goals.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/3/14,,World

They are the largest drills held by the two nations in five years.North Korea views these drills as rehearsal for invasion and said on Sunday that it will embark on ""important practical"" war deterrence measures.Analysts have previoysly said that North Korea would likely use the drills as an excuse to carry out more missile launches and perhaps even a nuclear test.""More missile launches with variations in style and scope should be expected, with even a nuclear test.

It provides Australia with three US Virginia class nuclear-powered submarines.The multi-stage project would culminate with British and Australian production and operation of a new class of submarine — a ""trilaterally developed"" vessel based on Britain's next-generation design that would be built in Britain and Australia and include ""cutting edge"" US technology.Biden said it was part of the alliance's, ""shared commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific.""The agreement will also see a force of US and British submarines deployed in Australia, to help train Australian crews and bolster deterrence.Sunak says the partnership will eventually lead to the UK Royal Navy operating the same submarines as the Australian Navy, boats that will share the same components and parts as the US Navy.According to China, AUKUS violates the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).Beijing has argued the transfer of nuclear weapons materials from a nuclear-weapon state to a non-nuclear-weapon state was a ""blatant"" violation of the spirit of the pact.Currently, no party to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty other than the five countries the NPT recognizes as weapons states — the US, Russia, China, Britain and France — has nuclear submarines.Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told reporters in Beijing: ""We urge the US, the UK and Australia to abandon the Cold War mentality and zero-sum games, honor international obligations in good faith and do more things that are conducive to regional peace and stability.""Biden stressed that the submarines are ""nuclear powered, not nuclear armed.""""These boats will not have any nuclear weapons of any kind of them,"" he said. ""I don't view what we're doing as a challenge to anybody.""AUKUS would be the first time Washington has shared nuclear-propulsion technology since the 1950s, when it partnered with Britain.The Australian leader said Albanese said the agreement ""represents the biggest single investment in Australia's defense capability in all of our history.""President Xi Jinping said Monday that China should develop its security and that it needed to modernize the military to create a ""Great Wall of steel.""Xi was speaking at the closing of the annual parliament session.""We must fully promote the modernization of national defense and the armed forces, and build the people's armed forces into a 'Great Wall of steel' that effectively safeguards national sovereignty, security, and development interests,"" he said.Biden said ""yes"" when asked Monday if he would speak to Xi soon, but to another question as to whether he would tell journalists when they would talk, he replied ""no.""He last month said he expected to speak to Xi about what the so-called Chinese spy balloon spat.Ahead of Monday's meeting Sunak pledged to increase the UK's defense spending by nearly 5 billion pounds (€5.6 billion or $6 billion) over the next two years.""Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine, weaponization of energy and food supplies and irresponsible nuclear rhetoric, combined with China's more aggressive stance in the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait, are threatening to create a world defined by danger, disorder and division,"" Sunak said in a refresh of Britain's blueprint for security and international policy that was also published on Monday.Of Britain's extra defense spending, 3 billion pounds would go towards nuclear projects, including help for the AUKUS plan to build nuclear-powered submarines for Australia to counter China.""It has pursued rapid and opaque military modernization with huge new investments, militarised disputed islands in the South China Sea, and refused to renounce the use of force to achieve its objectives with regard to Taiwan,"" the UK policy document states.On the sidelines of the AUKUS meeting, Sunak invited Biden to visit Northern Ireland in April to help celebrate the 25th anniversary of its peace accord, the 1998 Good Friday agreement.""I know it's something very special and personal to you,"" Sunak said. ""We'd love to have you over.""Biden said it was his ""intention"" to go to both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.The anniversary had been overshadowed in recent months after Northern Ireland's largest unionist party boycotted the power-sharing assembly that made up part of the peace deal, to protest post-Brexit trade rules.lo/rt (AFP, AP, Reuters)",2023/3/13,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834194,North Korea launches 2 missiles to sea as allies hold drills,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea test-fired two short-range ballistic missiles in another show of force Tuesday, a day after the United States and South Korea began military drills that Pyongyang views as an invasion rehearsal.The missiles launched from the southwestern coastal town of Jangyon flew across North Korea before landing in the sea off that country’s east coast, South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement. It said both missiles traveled about 620 kilometers (385 miles).The reported flight distances suggest the missiles target South Korea, which hosts about 28,000 U.S. troops. South Korea's military called the launches “a grave provocation” that undermines stability on the Korean Peninsula.The U.S. Indo-Pacific Command said Tuesday's launches don’t pose an immediate threat to its allies. But it said the North’s recent tests highlight the “destabilizing impact” of the North’s unlawful weapons programs and that the U.S. security commitment to South Korea and Japan remains “ironclad.”Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told reporters that officials were still gathering details of the North Korean launches and there were no immediate reports of damage in Japanese waters.Pyongyang could further escalate its weapons tests over the coming days in a tit-for-tat response to the allies’ military drills, which are planned to run until March 23. Last week, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ordered his troops to be ready to repel what he called the “frantic war preparations moves” by his country’s rivals.Worries about North Korea’s nuclear program have grown sharply after the North test-fired more than 70 missiles in 2022, many of them nuclear-capable weapons, and openly threatened to use them in potential conflicts with the United States and South Korea.North Korea appears to be using long-stalled talks with Washington and the expanding U.S.-South Korean drills as a chance to enlarge its weapons arsenals to increase its leverage in future dealings with the United States.The North Korean threats, along with China’s increasing assertiveness, have pushed the U.S. to seek to reinforce its alliances with South Korea and Japan. But some experts say a solidified Washington-Seoul-Tokyo cooperation could prompt Pyongyang, Beijing and Moscow to strengthen their own trilateral ties.China and Russia, embroiled in separate confrontations with the U.S., have repeatedly blocked U.S. and its allies’ bids to toughen United Nations sanctions on North Korea.Tuesday's launches were the North's second weapons test this week. On Monday, North Korea said it had test-fired two cruise missiles from a submarine the previous day. It implied the cruise missiles were being developed to carry nuclear warheads, though outside experts debate whether Pyongyang possesses functioning nuclear-armed missiles.Submarine-launched missile systems are harder to detect and would provide the North retaliatory second attack capability. But experts say it would take years, extensive resources and major technological improvements for the heavily sanctioned nation to build a fleet of submarines that could travel quietly and reliably execute strikes.U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said Monday that North Korea has been refining its submarine-launch capabilities since its first test in 2016, and the United States was studying Sunday’s launches to assess the North’s capabilities.“But of course, we’re not going to let any steps North Korea takes deter us or constrain us from the actions that we feel are necessary to safeguard stability on the Korean Peninsula,” Sullivan said.The U.S.-South Korean joint exercises that started Monday include computer simulations involving North Korean aggression and other security scenarios and field exercises. The field exercises would return to the scale of the allies’ biggest springtime exercises that were last held in 2018, according to South Korean defense officials.The two countries have been expanding their drills as North Korean nuclear threats have been growing.U.S.-South Korea drills will proceed normally, regardless of whether “North Korea tries to disrupt them with provocations like missile launches,” Jeon Ha Gyu, spokesperson of South Korea’s Defense Ministry, said Tuesday. U.S. State Department spokesperson Ned Price said Monday the United States has made clear it harbors no hostile intent toward North Korea and that the allies’ longstanding exercises are “purely defensive in nature.”Holding telephone talks for the second consecutive day to discuss the North Korean launches, the chief South Korean and U.S. nuclear envoys stressed Tuesday that the North would face “clear consequences” for its actions, without specifying what those would be. They said the allies will maintain “firm readiness” to respond to any kind of North Korean provocation, according to Seoul’s Foreign Ministry.Later this week, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol is to visit Tokyo for a summit with Kishida, where the North Korean threat is expected to be a major topic. The shared urgency over security is pushing Seoul and Tokyo closer together following years of disputes stemming from Japan’s colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula before the end of World War II.___Associated Press writer Mari Yamaguchi in Tokyo contributed to this report.___Find more AP Asia-Pacific coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific",2023/3/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834195,Kentucky House passes tax-relief bill for bourbon industry,"FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) — Proposed tax relief for Kentucky's bourbon makers was fast-tracked Monday in advancing in the state House, but local leaders living near some of the world's best-known distilleries were in no mood to toast the industry victory.The measure aims to phase out a property tax on the value of stored bourbon barrels — a top industry priority. The phaseout would begin in 2026 and be completed by 2039.House Bill 5 cleared the House on a 59-40 vote, soon after emerging from committee. With only a few days left in this year’s 30-day legislative session, the proposal advances to the Senate, where Republicans also have a supermajority.The barrel tax — assessed only in Kentucky — hurts the state's competitiveness and threatens to chip away at the state's status as the bourbon industry epicenter, the bill's supporters said.“No other manufacturer pays taxes on its goods during production,” said Eric Gregory, president of the the Kentucky Distillers’ Association. ""Taxes aren’t levied on vehicles rolling down the assembly line, dishwashers as they are being built, or tobacco drying in the barn.""Leaders from some of the top bourbon-producing counties, however, worry that the inventory tax phaseout will take away an important revenue source for local governments.“We need the money to survive or we’re going to have to cut services,” Nelson County Judge-Executive Timothy Hutchins told a House committee earlier Monday.Kentucky produces 95% of the world’s bourbon and is home to nearly 10 million barrels of aging spirits, according to the Kentucky Distillers’ Association.The bill's leading supporters include House Speaker David Osborne, who warned that “it is not our right to be home to the bourbon industry.” Several other states have surpassed Kentucky in total number of distilleries, though Kentucky is home to the largest production plants.“Kentucky taxes alcohol more than any other state in the country,” Osborne said.The barrel tax is a barrier to bourbon production startups in Kentucky, and it's a disincentive to store bourbon in the Bluegrass State, the speaker said. Gradually removing the tax will help “cement ourselves as the bourbon capital of the world,” he said.If the revenue raised from barrel taxes gradually gets smaller, the side effects from distilling operations will remain — wear and tear on roads and the ,spread of whiskey fungus, local leaders told lawmakers. The fungus is a black mold-like growth that feeds off the “angel’s share” — the distilling industry term for the alcohol that evaporates from the wooden barrels.In the past, when distillers asked local leaders for approval of their expansions, the producers touted the benefits to local governments from the barrel tax, they said.“I’m here today asking you to honor our handshake with the bourbon industry,” said Josh Ballard, a city council member in Loretto, home of the Maker's Mark distillery.The phaseout includes efforts to create revenue sources to offset losses for the affected local governments, the bill's supporters said. It includes “hold harmless” provisions for public school districts in bourbon-production counties. City and county governments could assess a license fee on distilleries to offset future revenue reductions.Those protections weren't enough to satisfy some lawmakers from bourbon-production counties who worried about the potential revenue losses.“I'm all for cutting taxes. But I'm not for cutting taxes on a booming industry that's going to place the burden on the backs of my constituents,” said Republican Rep. Candy Massaroni.",2023/3/14,,World

(AP) — The family of a Mississippi man whose dismembered body was found in November said his newly released autopsy report shows he was murdered, and they called for a federal investigation into the case Monday.Rasheem Carter, 25, was last seen on Oct. 2 at a hotel in Laurel. On Nov. 2, his decomposing body was found in a wooded area about 21 miles (33.80 kilometers) away in Taylorsville. At a news conference Monday alongside Carter's family, Ben Crump, a prominent civil rights attorney, said the Justice Department should take up the case after local police said they had no reason to believe the man's death was the result of foul play.“One thing is for certain,” Crump said. “This was not a natural death. This represents a young man who was killed.”In a statement on social media, the Smith County Sheriff’s Department did not elaborate on why they believed there was no foul play or what led them to the wooded area where Carter's remains were found.Crump said Carter's autopsy revealed his head was severed from his body, and some of his body parts were found in different locations.“What that tells us is this was a nefarious act, an evil act,” Crump said. “Someone murdered Rasheem Carter, and we cannot let them get away with this.”His family said the day before his disappearance, Carter, who is Black, went to the Taylorsville Police Department and reported that he feared for his safety because men were after him, WAPT-TV reported. They say they believe his killing might have been racially motivated.",2023/3/14,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834199,"Joe Pepitone, flamboyant Yankees All-Star, dead at 82","NEW YORK (AP) — Joe Pepitone, an All-Star and Gold Glove first baseman on the 1960s New York Yankees who gained renown for his flamboyant personality, hairpieces and penchant for nightlife, has died. He was 82.Pepitone was living with his daughter, Cara Pepitone, at her house in Kansas City, Missouri, and was found dead Monday morning, according to BJ Pepitone, a son of the former player. The cause of death was not immediately clear, but BJ Pepitone said a heart attack was suspected.The Yankees said in a statement Pepitone's “playful and charismatic personality and on-field contributions made him a favorite of generations of Yankees fans even beyond his years with the team in the 1960s.”Born in Brooklyn, Pepitone went to Manual Training High School, signed with the Yankees in 1958 and made his big league debut in 1962. He helped the Yankees to their second straight World Series title that year, a team led by Mickey Mantle, Roger Maris and Elston Howard.Pepitone drew attention for his off-the-field conduct. In a time when most players were staid and conformist, Pepitone was thought to be the first to bring a hair dryer into the clubhouse, an artifact later given to the Baseball Reliquary and displayed at the Burbank Central Library in California during a 2004 exhibition: “The Times They Were A-Changin’: Baseball in the Age of Aquarius.”He posed nude for a January 1975 edition of Foxylady magazine.“Things were a little different back then, sure,” Pepitone told Rolling Stone in 2015. “When I brought the hair dryer into the clubhouse, they thought I was a hairdresser or something; they didn’t know what the hell was going on, you know? I’d walk in with a black Nehru jacket on, beads, my hair slicked back; it was ridiculous. I think about it now, and I laugh.”Jim Bouton, in his groundbreaking 1970 book “Ball Four” that revealed the inner working of baseball teams, recounted how “Pepitone took to wearing the hairpieces when his hair started to get thin on top. ... He carries around all kinds of equipment in a little Blue Pan Am bag.”Pepitone’s 1975 autobiography, “Joe, You Coulda Made Us Proud,” detailed nightlife with Frank Sinatra, smoking marijuana with Mantle and Whitey Ford and Pepitone's jailing at Rikers Island.Yankees owner George Steinbrenner brought Pepitone back as a minor league hitting instructor in 1980 and promoted him to the big league team two years later. Pepitone said he would even trim his wigs to comply with the Yankees' grooming policy.“This one,” he told The New York Times, holding one wig, “is my gamer. It’s got gray in it. The longer one is my going-outer.”Pepitone was jailed at Rikers Island for about four months in 1988 following two misdemeanor drug convictions, then was rehired by the Yankees to work with minor leaguers. He was arrested in 1992 at a Catskills resort for a brawl that started when a man called him a “washed up nobody” and pleaded guilty in 1995 to driving while intoxicated.He joined the Yankees at a high point in the team's history. After winning the 1962 title, New York went on to take American League pennants the following two years only to lose in the Series, and Pepitone became an All-Star in three consecutive years starting in 1963.He stayed with the Yankees through their decline and was traded to Houston after the 1969 season for Curt Blefary.Pepitone went on to play for the Chicago Cubs from 1970-73 and finished his career with Atlanta and the Yakult Atoms of Japan’s Central League in 1973. He hit .258 with 219 homers and 721 RBIs.BJ Pepitone and Cara are children from Pepitone's third marriage, to Stephanie, who died in 2021. Pepitone also is survived by son Joseph Jr. and daughters Eileen and Lisa from earlier marriages. BJ Pepitone said the family had not yet decided on funeral plans.___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834200,Biden seeks to show stability in bid to avert banking chaos,"WASHINGTON (AP) — In 2016, Vice President Joe Biden warned against efforts to unravel banking regulations that Democrats had fought to implement following the nation’s financial crisis, just as the emerging Trump administration was determined to loosen those strict banking rules.Biden argued that without the far-reaching 2010 banking overhaul known as Dodd-Frank, financial institutions would continue to gamble with consumers' cash and ultimately hurt the middle class.“We can’t go back to the days when financial companies take massive risks with the knowledge that a taxpayer bailout is around the corner when they fail,” Biden said in a speech at Georgetown University in the waning days of the Obama administration.Now there's a banking crisis on his watch as president, and Biden is moving aggressively to assure the public that it is contained, bank executives will be fired, deposits are safe and taxpayers aren't on the hook — measures also designed to calm jittery financial markets.As he contemplates an announcement for a second term, Biden's ability to avert a contagion among financial institutions will test his contention that his administration represents competence and stability in contrast to the chaos of the Donald Trump years.His call for additional regulation, though, is likely to run into stiff resistance in the Republican-controlled House and even among some moderate Democratic lawmakers who joined Republicans to loosen some rules in a 2018 law — not to mention criticism from the still-forming 2024 Republican field that has already labeled his actions a bailout by just another name.Privately, Biden has been adamant that the government's intervention would not be like that of 2008, when Congress authorized billions in taxpayer cash to rescue financial institutions that were deemed too big to fail. That's according to a senior White House official, who was not authorized to describe private discussion by name.But administration officials believe that this time they had to act substantively despite bad decision-making by bank executives, given the economic risks and the potential impact on customers who did nothing wrong.Unlike in 2008, Biden was insistent that bank executives had to pay a price, said the official, granted anonymity to discuss internal White House deliberations.“The management of these banks will be fired,” Biden declared Monday. If an institution is taken over by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., “the people running the bank should not work there anymore.”On Monday, Biden also stressed that taxpayers will not bear the cost of his administration's penalties on the two failed banks, instead tapping into an insurance fund that is paid for by bank fees. And while customers and small businesses who stashed their money with the penalized banks would be protected, Biden emphasized that investors would not.“They knowingly took a risk and when the risk didn’t pay off, investors lose their money,” Biden said. “That’s how capitalism works.”California Rep. Maxine Waters, the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, said that Biden, like others, cannot ignore the lessons of the 2008 financial collapse and that having endured it firsthand, the president was well aware of the stakes. In conversations over the weekend, the White House assured her he was on top of it.“I think that his main concern was how to, No. 1, take care of the depositors and avoid contagion so that we would not basically, seriously, disrupt the banking system in this country,"" Waters said.Regulators put Silicon Valley Bank under FDIC control on Friday afternoon after panicked depositors rushed to withdraw all their funds within a matter of hours. That's a bank run. Top administration officials including Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen stressed that they were monitoring the situation, as reports of companies struggling to figure out how to manage their finances amid the two banks' shutdown rippled throughout the media and threatened regional banks around the country.By Sunday night, Treasury, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC announced that all Silicon Valley Bank clients would be able to access their money, as would depositors from Signature Bank in New York, which similarly failed and would be taken over by state regulators. As administration officials were working behind the scenes, Biden was regularly briefed by his chief of staff, Jeff Zients, National Economic Council director Lael Brainard and Yellen throughout the weekend, according to the White House.Biden also spoke with outside economists, although the White House declined to identify them.Administration officials also worked to brief lawmakers over the weekend, although several Republicans were left off a call for senators with Treasury and FDIC officials on Sunday night. After Republicans protested publicly, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., pointed out to Treasury that GOP senators were excluded, the administration quickly convened a separate briefing for Senate Republicans on Monday afternoon.There, several GOP senators conveyed their concerns to administration officials that Silicon Valley executives were being rescued in a way that could ultimately harm community banks in their home states, according to a person with knowledge of the call who was granted anonymity to discuss a private conversation. That would be because these banks would be assessed new fees to replenish the insurance fund that the administration tapped to aid the two failed banks' depositors.Indeed, the political specter of the word “bailout” will linger over the White House for some time.Republicans angling for the 2024 presidential nomination are already arguing that customers will ultimately bear the costs of the government's actions even if taxpayer funds weren't directly used. Some economists believe more fees levied on banks will just get passed onto consumers, such as increased rates for loans.“Joe Biden is pretending this isn’t a bailout. It is,"" former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley said, arguing that depositors at other banks now are “forced to subsidize Silicon Valley Bank’s mismanagement” and that bank customers will ultimately be responsible for the costs if the insurance fund is drained.Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., the top Republican on the Senate Banking Committee who is eyeing a presidential bid, also criticized what he called a “culture of government intervention,” arguing that it incentivizes banks to continue risky behavior if they know federal agencies will ultimately rescue them.White House and other administration officials are insisting their actions are not a bailout. But Harvard University economist Kenneth Rogoff said while he agrees that the government is rightly protecting the two banks' depositors, the money spent to make them whole is “certainly a bailout.”“The government swore after the financial crisis it was not going to bail out uninsured depositors and it was not going to bail out money funds,"" Rogoff said. ""It basically, as I understand it, is guaranteeing everything. So that’s certainly a bailout.”___AP White House correspondent Zeke Miller and AP chief congressional correspondent Lisa Mascaro contributed to this report.",2023/3/14,,World

(AP) — Transgender people in Tennessee would be prevented from changing their driver's licenses and birth certificates under legislation approved by Republican senators Monday.The legislation, which still must clear the House chamber, would define male and female in state law and base people’s legal gender identities on their anatomy at birth. Legislative officials have warned that enacting the bill could cost the state millions in federal funding because the definition conflicts with federal rules.According to the fiscal review, Tennessee faces a potential loss of $1.2 billion of federal education funding and $750,000 of federal grants dedicated to help women and children. Other state and local governments could also be impacted, but the review did not detail a specific amount.LGBTQ rights advocates have long argued that having a driver’s license or birth certificate match a person’s identity is not only personally important but also beneficial to avoiding harassment.However a handful of Republican-led state, including Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas have introduced similar bills as GOP lawmakers put transgender issues at the forefront of their legislative agenda.Gov.

Hélène St-Pierre said the 38-year-old driver, a local resident, turned himself in to police and was arrested under suspicion of committing a fatal hit and run.A senior government official familiar with the matter said the incident was not terrorism or national security related. The official spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.Authorities had not mentioned any motive.St-Pierre said the two people killed were both men, one in his 60s and the other in his 70s. Among the injured, two suffered serious injuries and the other seven were being evaluated, she said.St-Pierre said investigators and accident reconstruction experts were working to establish the circumstances of the crash.“Everything indicates it was an isolated incident, and that there is no more danger in the area, and there is just one suspect,” she said.The incident happened just after 3 p.m. along St-Benoit Boulevard in Amqui, a town about 350 kilometers (220 miles) northeast of Quebec City.The regional health board confirmed that a “code orange” had been declared at the Amqui hospital, which generally indicates a situation with a high number of casualties.Alain Gilbert, a truck driver, said he was driving into Amqui when he saw several ambulances tending to about four or possibly five people spread over a distance of about 500 meters (yards).He saw a police officer performing CPR on one person lying on the ground. He said there didn’t appear to be any children in the group.Last month in Laval, Quebec, police said a man driving a city bus deliberately smashed into a daycare center, killing two children.In 2021, a man used a pickup to kill four members of an immigrant family in London, Ontario, in what Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said was a hate crime directed at Muslims.In 2018, a man in a van rampaged through pedestrians in Toronto, killing 10 people.

Really, just anything can happen.""Texas A&M-Corpus Christi (23-10) has won 12 of its last 13, including the Southland Conference tournament. This time in the First Four, they face the Redhawks of Southeast Missouri State, a team that had a losing record before winning the Ohio Valley Conference tournament for the first time in 23 years.For the Redhawks, it was the first winning season in nine years.“It's basketball Christmas. It really is,” Southeast Missouri State coach Brad Korn said. “Every time you turn the corner, you smile at something else. We had a guy playing bagpipes at the hotel today, so what else could you ask for?”The winner moves on as the 16th seed to face top-seeded Alabama in the first round at Birmingham on Thursday.THESE GUYS AGAINTexas Southern is as close to a First Four regular as the annual play-in event can claim.The Tigers return to the event for the third straight year and fifth time overall, facing off Wednesday night against Fairleigh Dickinson (17-15), the New Jersey school that won a First Four game in 2019 and is just a year removed from a 4-22 finish.Texas Southern's fifth-year coach, Johnny Jones, is 3-0 in the First Four since taking over in 2018. The Tigers come to Dayton this time with a losing record (14-20) but earned the postseason berth by sweeping through the Southwest Conference tournament, beating second-seeded Grambling State in the final.The winner of the Texas Southern-Fairleigh Dickinson game will jump on Interstate 70 for the hour's drive to Columbus, where it will slot in as the 16th seed in the East and play top-seeded Purdue on Friday.DIFFERENT STYLESMississippi State and Pitt should be an intriguing matchup because their strengths are so different.Mississippi State (21-12) is the worst 3-point shooting team in college basketball. Expect the Bulldogs, just 8-10 in the SEC, to try to get to the rim and try to clamp down on Pitt with excellent perimeter defense.The Panthers (22-11) can make the mid-range and long jumpers but don't play as well inside, and they aren't as good defensively.“One of the things that’s difficult is that we can’t simulate their size and their strength and athleticism in what we’re doing in practice,"" Pitt coach Jeff Capel said. “So we really have to be totally dialed in to the little things that add up to big things.”The winner of the late Tuesday night game advances to Midwest Regional as the 11th seed, facing sixth-seeded Iowa State on Friday.FAMILIAR FACESArizona State (22-12) beat Oregon State and USC in the Pac-12 tournament before being routed in the semifinal by No. 8 Arizona, a team the Sun Devils had bested Feb. 25.They did so in no small part because of forward Warren Washington and Desmond Cambridge Jr., a fifth-year guard who led the team with 13.7 points per game.Both players transferred from Nevada — the team Arizona State will face in Wednesday's late game.Nevada lost four of its last six games to finish 22-10 but still got picked off the bubble for the play-in game. Guard Jared Lucas leads the way, averaging 17.3 points and hitting 38% of his 3-point shots.The winner moves on as the 11th seed in the West and a Friday matchup with TCU.MOVING ONFor bracketeers looking for a Cinderella to come out of Dayton, it could happen.In fact, at least one First Four team has gone on to win another game in the tournament every year except 2019. The event has been played in Dayton every year since 2011, except for 2020, when it was canceled because of the pandemic, and 2021 when it was moved under the COVID-19 bubble in Indianapolis.In 2011, No. 11 seed VCU got on a roll and went all the way to the Final Four, beating No. 1 Kansas in the regional final.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834205,"DeSantis bills on diversity, gender pass Florida committees","TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Florida Republicans on Monday advanced two key initiatives of Gov. Ron DeSantis as he prepares for an expected presidential run — banning gender affirming care for minors and eliminating diversity programs in colleges.The proposals have cleared separate committees but must still win approval from the full House and Senate chambers.DeSantis is pursing an aggressive conservative agenda on race, gender and education ahead of his expected candidacy, continuing a stance that has made him one of the most popular Republicans in the country.The Republican supermajority in the statehouse is set to rubber stamp virtually all DeSantis' priorities during this year’s legislative session, giving the governor a platform of policy wins that could prove popular during a GOP primary.The governor has been a leading critic of diversity, equity and inclusion programs in colleges, known as DEI, as well as Critical Race Theory, which is a way of thinking about American history through the lens of racism.Ahead of Monday's committee vote, DeSantis held a roundtable discussion to criticize diversity programs as racially divisive and discriminatory. He has frequently targeted the programs in criticism of what he calls “woke” ideology in education.“In Florida, we are not going to back down to the woke mob, and we will expose the scams they are trying to push onto students across the country,” DeSantis said. “Florida students will receive an education, not a political indoctrination.”The proposal would bar colleges from using state or federal funding for diversity, equity and inclusion programs. It would prevent schools from having course curricula involving Critical Race Theory or so-called radical feminist theory, radical gender theory, queer theory, critical social justice or intersectionality.In addition, universities would be able to conduct post-tenure reviews of faculty at any time for cause, in addition to a required review every five years.Critics said the bill would disadvantage college students when they seek employment after graduation, could endanger accreditation of Florida courses and would stifle academic freedom on campuses.“It’s not the responsibility of the state to define or dictate what we can or cannot learn. That is our choice, especially as adults within higher ed institutions,” said Rep. Anna Eskamani, a Democrat. “Why are we scared of these topics? Why do we not want adults like me in public universities who choose to learn about these theories to have an opportunity to learn about it, to question it, to debate it?”Scholars developed Critical Race Theory during the 1970s and 1980s in response to what scholars viewed as a lack of racial progress following the civil rights legislation of the 1960s. The theory centers on the idea that racism is systemic in the nation’s institutions, which function to maintain the dominance of white people in society.Last year the governor signed legislation dubbed the Stop WOKE Act that restricts certain race-based conversations and analysis in schools and businesses. The law bars instruction that says members of one race are inherently racist or should feel guilt for past actions committed by others of the same race, among other things.Dozens of transgender people, parents with transgender children and their supporters gathered in a Senate committee room to speak against the bill banning gender-affirming care for minors.Opponents said it would lead to higher suicide rates, depression and anxiety and would cause far more harm than good.Democratic lawmakers said their Republican colleagues are backing government intervention in private conversations families have with their doctors and stripping those families of their rights to care for their children.Democratic Sen. Tracie Davis addressed her remarks to the people who testified against the bill.“What we've done today with this legislation is vilify who you are,"" Davis said. “There are children out there who believe they are better off dead because of the lack of support, and all you said today is say, 'Love me as I am.'”Republican Sen. Clay Yarborough said his bill is about protecting children, and told opponents he respects them.“Every person was created with extraordinary worth, incredible value and a unique purpose from the time they were created. You can't change that,"" Yarborough said. “We need to let kids be kids, and our laws need to set appropriate boundaries that respect the rights and responsibilities of parents while protecting children.”",2023/3/14,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834223,"Rangers finally see deGrom in a game, against minor leaguers","Two-time National League Cy Young Award winner Jacob deGrom finally pitched in a game for the Texas Rangers, though it was on a back field against minor leaguers.The Rangers have been cautious with their prized addition since he reported tightness in his left side before the first spring training workout just less than a month ago. His first spring start came in the more-controlled environment for Triple-A Round Rock on Monday, when he struck out five of the eight batters he faced while throwing 20 of 24 pitches for strikes over two innings against Kansas City minor leaguers at the complex the big league franchises share in Surprise, Arizona.“The first couple of batters, I didn’t locate my fastball that well,” deGrom said. “The second inning I dialed it in a little bit. Everything felt great. I threw all four pitches. I’m really happy with it. Changeup, curveball I think are going to be plus-pitches this year. I was able to mix them in quite a bit.""New Rangers manager Bruce Bochy said deGrom looked “really good” with his delivery and velocity, and got better as he went.The only hit allowed by deGrom was an inside-the-park home run by Omar Hernandez, the second batter faced. The ball ricocheted high off the batter's eye in center field and past two outfielders.After his two innings in the game, deGrom threw 23 more pitches in the bullpen. He said he anticipates being ready for opening day March 30.Texas signed deGrom to a $185 million, five-year contract in December. He spent his first nine big league seasons with the New York Mets. but injuries limited him to 156 1/3 innings in 26 starts over the past two years. The 34-year-old right-hander threw about six bullpen sessions before arriving in Arizona, but was delayed in throwing in camp after telling the team he was stiff.“The last thing I want to do is call in and say my left side is a little tight. (The Rangers) handled it great, they said let’s take four days and knock it out. Get it behind us,"" deGrom said. ""This one was interesting because if I had it during the season I would have pitched with it. We caught it early enough. We have plenty of time let’s do the smart thing here.”ALSO ON BACK FIELDS— Max Scherzer made his scheduled start Monday for the New York Mets in a minor league game.The right-hander allowed five runs (three earned) over parts of five innings. Three of the innings were cut short because of his pitch count.Tylor Megill, who could get a shot in the starting rotation due to lefty José Quintana's fractured rib, struck out three in four scoreless innings in the main game for the Mets against the Miami Marlins.— While deGrom was pitching in his minor league game, another of the Rangers' offseason additions was doing the same at the Surprise complex. Nathan Eovaldi, who has also dealt with tightness in his side, allowed two hits in two scoreless innings while pitching for Double-A Frisco. The right-hander threw 22 of his 29 pitches for strikes.QUINTANA UPDATEThe New York Mets expect to have an update this week on the status of Quintana, the free-agent addition who has a stress fracture in a rib on his left side.Mets general manager Billy Eppler said Monday that the team was still getting more information from doctors after the pitcher went from Florida to New York for further evaluation.Quintana, who signed a $26 million, two-year deal during the offseason, threw in a minor-league exhibition game March 5 before the diagnosis of the stress fracture that was revealed last week. He never made it to pitch for Colombia in the World Baseball Classic.Eppler said the team would provide an update when it has all of the information. While not denying a New York Post report Monday that the pitcher would be shut down from throwing for three months, the GM called it premature.The 34-year-old Quintana was 6-7 with a 2.93 ERA combined while pitching for Pittsburgh and St. Louis last season. He is 89-87 with a 3.75 ERA in 315 games (289 starts) over 11 big league seasons with six teams.MUSGROVE’S BIG TOESan Diego Padres All-Star pitcher Joe Musgrove on Monday threw his second bullpen session since breaking his left big toe when he dropped a kettlebell two weeks ago.“Again, it's miraculous, he didn’t feel it at all,” Padres manager Bob Melvin said. “You're watching to see his reaction on every pitch, if he’s reacting at all to the toe. And all he’s talking about is grips. ... Looks like we're on a pretty good path.”The big right-hander, who also threw a bullpen session Saturday, is now set to return to San Diego for what was a planned evaluation to monitor his progress.Melvin said he still considered it a “longshot” for Musgrove to pitch opening day March 30 against Colorado, and was unsure of the hometown pitcher's timeline. Musgrove could still avoid a stint on the injured list and pitch in the opening six-game homestand.While Musgrove is going into his third season with the Padres, this is the start of a $100 million, five-year contract he signed late last season.RIZZO'S BACKAnthony Rizzo said he felt fine after taking batting practice Monday, a day after being scratched from the New York Yankees lineup because of his back.While Rizzo didn't play again Monday, the team has said it didn't believe the problem was serious. The 33-year-old first baseman who is going into his 13th season acknowledged early in spring training that he would be crazy to say he wouldn't have a back issue this year. He received an epidural injection last season.The Yankees re-signed Rizzo in mid-November to a $40 million, two-year contract, after he hit .224 with 32 home runs and 75 RBIs in 130 games last year after spending the previous 10 seasons with the Chicago Cubs.RAYS ON BASETampa Bay won its exhibition game 9-5 over Detroit on Monday, when the Rays had all eight of their hits and all of their runs in the first three innings.The Rays sent 24 batters to the plate in the first three innings, with 15 of them reaching base (eight hits, six walks, one hit batsman) and another hitting a sacrifice fly. The other eight outs were six strikeouts and two infield popups.___AP freelance writer Gary Schatz contributed to this report.___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/14,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834226,US turns to new ways to punish Russian oligarchs for the war,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. has begun an aggressive new push to inflict pain on Russia’s economy and specifically its oligarchs with the intent of thwarting the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine.From the Treasury Department to the Justice Department, U.S. officials will focus on efforts to legally liquidate the property of Russian oligarchs, expand financial penalties on those who facilitate the evasion of sanctions, and close loopholes in the law that allow oligarchs to use shell companies to move through the U.S. financial system.Andrew Adams, who heads the U.S. government's KleptoCapture task force, designed to enforce the economic restrictions within the U.S. imposed on Russia and its billionaires, told The Associated Press that the group is prioritizing its efforts to identify those who help Russians evade sanctions and violate export controls.“These illicit procurement networks will continue to take up an ever-increasing amount of our bandwidth,” said Adams, who also serves as acting deputy assistant attorney general.So far, more than $58 billion worth of sanctioned Russians’ assets have been blocked or frozen worldwide, according to a report last week from the Treasury Department. That includes two luxury yachts each worth $300 million in San Diego and Fiji, and six New York and Florida properties worth $75 million owned by sanctioned oligarch Viktor Vekselberg.The U.S. has begun attempts to punish the associates and wealth managers of oligarchs — in Vekselberg's case, a federal court in New York indicted Vladimir Voronchenko after he helped maintain Vekselberg’s properties. He was charged in February with conspiring to violate and evade U.S. sanctions.The case was coordinated through the KleptoCapture group.“I think it can be quite effective to be sanctioning facilitators,” Adams said, calling them “professional sanctions evasion brokers.”A February study led by Dartmouth University researchers showed that targeting a few key wealth managers would cause far greater damage to Russia than sanctioning oligarchs individually.Other attempts to inflict pain on the Russian economy will come from the efforts to liquidate yachts and other property owned by Russian oligarchs and the Kremlin, turning them into cash to benefit Ukraine.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has long called for Russian assets to be transferred to Ukraine, and former Biden administration official Daleep Singh told the Senate Banking Committee on Feb. 28 that forfeiting Russia's billions in assets held by the U.S. is “something we ought to pursue.”Singh suggested the U.S. should “use the reserves that we have immobilized at the New York Fed, transfer them to Ukraine and allow them to put them up as collateral to raise money.” He ran the White House's Russia sanctions program when he was national security adviser for international economics.Adams said the KleptoCapture task force is pursuing efforts to sell Russians' yachts and other property, despite the legal difficulties of turning property whose owners' access has been blocked into forfeited assets that the government can take and sell for the benefit of Ukraine.He stressed that the U.S. will operate under the rule of law. “Part of what that means is that we will not take assets that are not fully, totally forfeited through the judicial procedures and begin confiscating them without a legal basis,” Adams said.He added that the task force has had “success in working with Congress and working with folks around the executive branch in obtaining authorization to transfer certain forfeited funds to the State Department.”The Treasury Department said on Thursday that the government is “paving the way” for $5.4 million in seized funds to be sent as foreign assistance to Ukraine.Additionally, strengthening laws that serve as loopholes for sanctions evaders will also be a priority across federal departments, officials say.The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, under Treasury, is expected to roll out rules to address the use of the U.S. real estate market to launder money, including a requirement on disclosing the true ownership of real estate.Steven Tian, director of research at the Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute, who tracks companies' disengagement from Russia, said the new real estate rule is long overdue.“I would point out that it’s not just unique to Russian oligarchs. As you know, the real estate market makes use of shell companies in the United States, period,"" Tian said.Erica Hanichak, the government affairs director at the FACT Coalition, a nonprofit that promotes corporate transparency, urged the administration to put the rule forward by late March, when the U.S. co-hosts the second Summit for Democracy with the governments of Costa Rica, Netherlands, South Korea and Zambia.“We’re viewing this as an opportunity for the United States to demonstrate leadership not only in addressing corrupt practices abroad, but looking to our own backyard and addressing the loopholes in our system that facilitate corruption internationally,"" she said.",2023/3/14,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834245,Images from Taiwan's National Palace Museum leaked onto Chinese websites,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — An assistant researcher caused images of the National Palace Museum's treasures to be leaked onto Chinese websites in June 2022, revealed Museum Deputy Director Hung Yonh-Thai (黃永泰) on Tuesday (March 14).The public can buy high-quality images of the National Palace Museum’s treasures at low prices on unauthorized Chinese websites, such as Baidu, Taobao, and Shuge. It is alleged that this leak was a result of Chinese hackers accessing the museum’s database, according to Mirror Media.However, Hung said the accident was caused by an assistant researcher, surnamed Lin, who used a public system to process 400,000 photos. While the photos underwent processing, anonymous users had access to the backend and downloaded the photos.Hung estimated that 100,000 images, including famous ones, had been leaked.At the time of the incident, Wu Mi-cha (吳密察) served as the museum's director.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834246,"Alcaraz, Fritz win; Murray, Badosa out at Indian Wells","INDIAN WELLS, Calif. (AP) — Carlos Alcaraz defeated Tallon Griekspoor 7-6 (4), 6-3 in the BNP Paribas Open on Monday, joining defending champion Taylor Fritz in the fourth round.Former NBA players Dirk Nowitzki and Steve Nash sat in the front row to see Alcaraz advance in the Southern California desert, where he was a semifinalist a year ago. The 19-year-old from Spain can return to the world's No. 1 ranking by winning the title here.The fourth-seeded Fritz routed Sebastian Baez 6-1, 6-2. Fritz served four aces and won 88% of his first-serve points against the 30th-seeded Baez from Argentina.“I’m trying to take it like it’s any other tournament, but it is pretty tough to not know that I’m defending a title,” Fritz said. “I’m getting constantly reminded of that.”Andy Murray's run ended with a 7-6 (6), 6-2 loss to 21-year-old Jack Draper.“I’ve looked up to Andy since I was so young,” Draper said. ""I watched him win Wimbledon for the first time in 2013 and then I’ve had the opportunity to get to know him and practice with him often since 2019. He’s a really special person, a great champion and a great human being, and it was a privilege to play against him on this court.”Murray has not won three consecutive matches at a Masters 1000 event since he won the title in Paris in 2016.Also advancing was Stan Wawrinka, who defeated No. 7 seed Holger Rune, 2-6, 7-6 (5), 7-5. American Tommy Paul beat ninth-seeded Hubert Hurkacz, 4-6, 6-2, 6-4.Rune saved a match point and rallied from 2-5 down to win the second-set tiebreaker. But Wawrinka recovered in the third to send his 19-year-old opponent packing.“The last 45 minutes was tough,” Wawrinka said. ""I had the match in control and was playing well. I was putting a lot of pressure — I should have won the match way before.”Wawrinka reached the fourth round at Indian Wells for the first time since 2017, when he lost in the final. He turns 38 next month.“All my career I know only one way,” Wawrinka said. ""To keep fighting, working, pushing myself and stay positive. I am super happy with the win.”No. 8 Felix Auger-Aliassime avoided the upset bug and beat Francisco Cerundolo, 7-5, 6-4.In women's action, top-ranked Iga Swiatek beat 2019 champion Bianca Andreescu, 6-3, 7-6 (1).""I’m glad that I got the chance to play under pressure a little bit more, and see how I am going to cope with that,” Swiatek said on court.No. 4 Ons Jabeur lost to Marketa Vondrousova, 7-6 (5), 6-4, and No. 5 Caroline Garcia outlasted Leylah Fernandez, 6-4, 6-7 (5), 6-1.Qualifier Varvara Gracheva knocked out No. 8 Daria Kasatkina, 6-4, 6-4.Emma Raducanu, the 2021 U.S Open champion, beat No. 13 Beatriz Haddad Maia, 6-1, 2-6, 6-4.The final set lasted more than an hour, with Raducanu breaking Haddad Maia’s serve to go up 4-3. Raducanu held the rest of the way and closed it out on her fourth match point. It was her biggest win over an opponent since her breakthrough run at the U.S. Open.Next up for Raducanu is a fourth-round match against Swiatek.“I’m pretty sure I’ll be ready tactically; my coach is good at tactics so I’m just going to trust him,” Swiatek said. ”I’m pretty sure that I got into the rhythm already, so hopefully I’m going to play better with every match.”No. 10 Elena Rybakina beat defending champion and doubles partner Paula Badosa, 6-3, 7-5.___AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834247,Haley wants entitlement program changes for younger people,"MYRTLE BEACH, S.C. (AP) — Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley is proposing changes to entitlement programs for younger generations, opening the door to potential cuts to Social Security and Medicare if elected.At a campaign rally Monday night in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, Haley promised not to touch the benefits of older people who retired with certain guarantees of a financial future.“We’re not taking it from seniors,” Haley said. “We’re not taking it to anyone who’s been promised anything. My parents are in their 80s. I don’t want anybody touching theirs.”But Haley, making her first campaign stop in South Carolina since launching her campaign last month, said her children, both of whom are in their 20s, are part of the generation for whom the benefits should be altered.“Those are the ones we tell the rules have changed — anyone new coming in this system,” said Haley, a former South Carolina governor and U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. “That’s how you do entitlement reform. You let them know, it’s not going to be there for you anyway, because Social Security goes bankrupt in 10 years, Medicare goes bankrupt in five. We have to do something.”Most leading Republicans have recently sought to signal their unwillingness to touch entitlement programs, though the GOP has a long history of threatening to slash the benefits. President Joe Biden, who has promised to “defend and strengthen” the programs, was met with boos from congressional Republicans when he said during his State of the Union address that “some Republicans want Medicare and Social Security to sunset.”Democrats have pointed to a plan by Republican Sen. Rick Scott of Florida, introduced last year, that called for all federal spending legislation to sunset in five years, subject to votes in Congress that could preserve programs. After Biden's speech, Scott amended the plan to exempt Social Security, Medicare, national security, veterans benefits, and other essential services.The programs are coming up against insolvency deadlines. Forecasters say Social Security won’t be able to pay out its promised benefits in about a dozen years, and Medicare won’t be able to do so in just five years. Economists say both programs will drive the national debt higher in the decades to come, forcing teeth-gritting choices for the next generation of lawmakers.Others in the presidential field have taken the issue head on. On Monday in Davenport, Iowa, former President Donald Trump pledged to keep the programs as they are. “I will not be cutting Medicare, and I will not be cutting Social Security,"" he declared.Speaking Sunday on Fox News, Haley proposed elevating the retirement age “so that it matches life expectancy,” an idea she has mentioned during other campaign stops without delineating a specific age.To Haley, entitlement reform should also include a move “to limit the benefits for the wealthy,"" as well as an expansion of Medicare Advantage, in which private companies offer plans that are reimbursed by the government for care.“Let’s create the competition,” Haley said. ""There are great programs — it will cause health care costs to go down. That’s how you deal with the budget. That’s what we’ll do.”For the age limits, as well as the proposals for wealthier Americans, Haley has not specified details on what she has in mind.Since opening her campaign Feb. 15, Haley has made stops in Iowa and New Hampshire, given speeches at the Conservative Political Action Conference and Americans for Prosperity gatherings and raised money in New York — although the campaign has said it won't release fundraising figures until the end of the first quarter.___Meg Kinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP",2023/3/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834248,Bill to legalize sports wagering clears Kentucky House,"FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) — A bill to legalize sports betting in Kentucky won House passage on Monday, setting up a Senate showdown on a proposal that creates divisions among the Republican supermajorities.Past efforts to legalize sports wagering in the Bluegrass State garnered House support but died in the Senate. It’s a reflection of how divisive the gambling issue is in the state that’s home to Churchill Downs in Louisville, where the Kentucky Derby is run.“This does create a regulated marketplace for sports wagering, taking sports wagering in Kentucky out of the shadows, out of the darkness and moving it into the light,” said Republican Rep. Michael Meredith, the bill’s lead sponsor.The measure cleared the House on a 63-34 vote, but its prospects in the Senate are uncertain, with a higher procedural hurdle for supporters to overcome this year. It needs a three-fifths vote in each chamber to pass, since it’s a revenue-producing bill in an odd-numbered year.Opponents dug in for the looming fight in the Senate. After the House vote, The Family Foundation said the sports wagering bill represents “a massive expansion of predatory gambling at a time when Kentuckians can least afford it.”A key supporter of the bill, Senate Majority Floor Leader Damon Thayer, said later Monday that it's ""going to be tough” to reach that higher threshold in the Senate.“But first thing’s first, I want to try to get it out of committee,” Thayer said in an interview.After several years of coming up short, supporters said it’s time for Kentucky to accept a form of wagering already available in most of Kentucky's neighboring states.“You literally just have to drive across the county line or cross the river to go take part in their programs.” Meredith said.The bill’s opponents said state-sanctioned sports wagering would create more social problems that hurt families. Republican Rep. Chris Fugate said: “This is not legislation that Kentucky can be proud of.”“This is not good for Kentucky,” he said. “It’s not good for families. It’s not good for people. And I really hope and pray we get to see some legislation that will bring jobs into east Kentucky and to the rural parts of this state.”If legalized, sports wagering in Kentucky is expected to generate about $23 million a year in tax revenue, Meredith said.House Bill 551 would allow Kentucky’s horse racing tracks to be licensed as sports betting facilities for a $500,000 upfront fee and an annual renewal fee of $50,000. Participating tracks could contract with up to three service providers to provide sports wagering services at the track itself, or through online sites and mobile applications. Service providers would have to pay $50,000 for an initial license, with a $10,000 annual renewal fee.Under the bill, the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission would regulate sports wagering operations. Revenue generated from taxing such wagering would cover those regulatory costs. A percentage of the revenue would go into a fund focused on dealing with problem gambling. The leftover revenue after that would flow into the state public pension system.",2023/3/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834249,Trevor Bauer signs with BayStars in Japanese baseball league,"TOKYO (AP) — Yokohama DeNA BayStars manager Daisuke Miura — a former pitcher with the Japan Central League team — warmly welcomed Trevor Bauer's signing with the club.The 2020 NL Cy Young Award winner was released by the Los Angeles Dodgers on Jan. 12, three weeks after an arbitrator reduced his suspension imposed by baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred from 324 to 194 games. The penalty followed an investigation into domestic violence, which the pitcher has denied.“I’m so excited, and I think the world reaction is going to be tremendous,” BayStars manager Miura said, speaking in Japanese. ""I believe a very powerful pitcher is coming who will enhance our chances for winning the championship.”In the video posted on the club website, Miura signed off with two words in English — “See you.”In a similar signing, former MLB reliever Roberto Osuna — who received a 75-game suspension for violating the major league's domestic violence policy — signed last season with the Chiba Lotte Marines.Bauer also played up his signing in a video message. Season-opening games for Japanese clubs are March 30-31.“Playing in the NPB has always been a dream of mine and I can’t think of a better organization to do it with,"" Bauer said in a statement Monday, referring to Nippon Professional Baseball.The BayStars said Bauer will wear uniform No. 96.“To all the BayStar fans out there — I am so excited for the opportunity to be part of the great team we have this year and to try to bring home a championship,” Bauer said. ""And to all the Japanese baseball fans out there — I cannot wait to see you guys out at the stadium soon. Please come say hi and help me learn more about your great country. See you guys soon!”Bauer is owed about $22.5 million from the remainder of his $102 million, three-year contract with the Dodgers. The suspension has cost him roughly $37.6 million in salary.Manfred suspended Bauer last April for violating the league’s domestic violence and sexual assault polic y, after a San Diego woman said he beat and sexually abused her in 2021. Bauer has maintained he did nothing wrong, saying that everything that happened between him and the woman was consensual.Bauer was never charged with a crime.The players’ association filed a grievance on Bauer’s behalf, and a three-person panel headed by Martin Scheinman ruled Dec. 22 that Bauer violated MLB’s policy and docked his pay for the first 50 games of 2023, covering part of the period the pitcher was on paid leave in 2021 and ’22.Bauer joined his hometown Dodgers before the 2021 season and was 8-5 with a 2.59 ERA in 17 starts before being placed on leave.In February 2022, Los Angeles prosecutors decided not to charge Bauer for allegedly beating and sexually abusing the San Diego woman because they said they were unable to prove her accusations beyond a reasonable doubt.The woman, who was 27 at the time, said Bauer choked her into unconsciousness, punched her repeatedly and sexually assaulted her during two sexual encounters.The Associated Press does not typically identify people who say they have been victims of sexual assault.Bauer said in a video posted on YouTube after the prosecutor’s decision that he and the woman engaged in rough sex at her suggestion and followed guidelines they agreed to in advance. Each encounter ended with her spending the night at his Pasadena home, he said.“The disturbing acts and conduct that she described simply did not occur,” he said at the time.The woman had sought a restraining order, but a judge denied it. The judge found that Bauer honored the woman’s boundaries when the woman set them, and could not have known about those he violated because she didn’t express them clearly.Bauer was an All-Star in 2018 and is 83-69 with a 3.79 ERA in 10 seasons for Arizona (2012), Cleveland, (2013-19), Cincinnati (2019-20) and the Dodgers. He won the NL Cy Young Award with Cincinnati during the pandemic-shortened 2020 season.___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834250,NFL will consider reviewing roughing-the-passer penalties,"The NFL’s competition committee will consider making roughing-the-passer penalties and personal-foul penalties subject to video review.The two potential rule changes were among nine the league announced Monday in its 2023 playing rules, bylaw and resolution proposals submitted by clubs.The Los Angeles Rams proposed the change that would allow teams to challenge roughing-the-passer calls. Several such calls sparked outrage last season, leaving players and coaches questioning what constitutes a legal hit on a quarterback.The Detroit Lions proposed giving teams an opportunity to challenge personal foul calls.The competition committee will consider the rule changes later this month when NFL owners gather in Arizona for their annual meeting.Other proposals include an option to try to convert a fourth-and-20 from the kicking team’s 20-yard line instead of attempting an onside kick. The Philadelphia Eagles submitted that proposal. The Eagles are also asking the competition committee to consider allowing players to wear No. 0.The Lions also proposed giving clubs more opportunities for a third challenge and expanding the replay official’s jurisdiction to allow for consultation regarding penalty assessment.The Houston Texans proposed expanding the replay official’s jurisdiction to allow for review on failed fourth down attempts.The New York Jets proposed an amendment to expand the crackback prohibition to players who go in motion and go beyond the center to block (“split-flow block”) a defender below the waist.The Los Angeles Chargers proposed adjustment of the play clock following an instant replay reversal consistent with other timing rules.Two bylaws proposals involve emergency quarterbacks and playoff seeds.The Lions proposed allowing teams to designate an emergency third quarterback from their inactive list or practice squad who would be eligible to enter a game if the first two quarterbacks on the active list are ruled out.The Chargers proposed seeding wild-card teams ahead of division champions if the division champ has a losing record (under .500 winning percentage) and the wild-card team has at least four more wins.Among the resolution proposals is one submitted by 25 teams that would establish one preseason roster reduction date instead of the current three.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/3/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834251,Wiseman's double-double helps Pistons end 11-game skid,"DETROIT (AP) — James Wiseman had 18 points and 14 rebounds as the Detroit Pistons ended an 11-game losing streak with a 117-97 win over the Indiana Pacers on Monday night.The Pistons, who hadn't won since beating San Antonio 138-131 in double overtime on Feb. 10, led by 31 points in the first half and held off an Indiana surge late in the second quarter and early in the third.“When you come in having lost 11 or 12 games in a row - whatever it was - you know you have to stay focused to win a game,” said Cory Joseph, who had a game-high 22 points. “We played extremely hard and got off to a great start.”The Pacers beat Detroit 121-115 at Little Caesars Arena on Saturday night.“The difference in the two games was obvious,” Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said. “That was the edge the Pistons played with from start to end. We simply did not match it.”Jalen Duren put up 12 points and 11 rebounds and Killian Hayes had 10 points and 11 assists.“Our guys played with a lot of grit tonight, and I think we surprised the Pacers a little bit,” Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. “This was a little like the playoffs - we made some adjustments from Saturday and they made some adjustments - but the difference was our toughness.”Jordan Nwora had 20 points off the bench for Indiana.As they had on Saturday, both teams played with shorthanded rosters. Detroit added Marvin Bagley III (ankle) to its lengthy injury list, while the Pacers were missing Tyrese Haliburton, Bennedict Mathurin, T.J. McConnell and Myles Turner.Indiana dominated Saturday's first half inside, but Detroit took control early on Monday. The Pistons had a 20-6 edge on points in the paint and a 15-7 rebounding advantage as they outscored the Pacers 38-20 in the first quarter. Eugene Omoruyi, making his third NBA start, had 11 of his 17 points in the quarter.“We got a lot of easy shots early in the game on Saturday, but the Pistons really flipped the script on that tonight,” Carlisle said. “Omoruyi starting gave them more quickness and toughness in the lineup and we didn't get a lot of good shots.”Detroit led 52-23 after four minutes of the second quarter, but Indiana was back within 67-49 at halftime.The Pacers cut the deficit to 69-57 early in the third quarter, but Detroit answered with a 13-point run to go up by 25 points.TIP INSPacers: Indiana went from 64 points in the paint and 26 second-chance points on Saturday to 44 and 14 on Monday. ... Chris Duarte was limited to 24 minutes by a sore ankle.Pistons: Detroit's win was their first against a Central Division opponent this season after twelve straight losses. ... The Pistons hadn't won by a double-digit margin since beating Portland 135-118 on Jan. 11.LOCAL HOLIDAYThe game drew 18,313 fans on for a special “3-1-3 Day” promotion. March 13 is celebrated as an unofficial holiday in Detroit as the date matches the city's area code.“The fans have stuck with us all season, and they've been great during this losing streak,” Joseph said. “I'm glad we could get them a win on 3-1-3 Day.”UP NEXTPacers: Visit the Milwaukee Bucks on Thursday.Pistons: Visit the Washington Wizards on Tuesday.___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/14,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834253,Eric Kendricks says he's agreed to terms with Chargers,"Eric Kendricks agreed to terms with the Los Angeles Chargers on Monday, giving the franchise a veteran inside linebacker on a unit that has struggled the past couple seasons.Kendricks posted about joining the Chargers on his Instagram account. He was drafted by Minnesota in the second round in 2015 and spent eight seasons with the Vikings before being released on March 6.The 31-year old linebacker has started 113 regular-season and six playoff games.Kendricks was 14th in the league this past season with 137 total tackles, including 87 solo. He also recorded eight tackles for loss, two quarterback hits, one sack and six passes defensed.According to Sportradar figures, Kendricks is second among linebackers in total tackles since 2015.Kendricks would be paired with Kenneth Murray at inside linebacker in the Chargers' 3-4 scheme with Joey Bosa and Khalil Mack lining up at the outside spots. Kendricks would likely replace Drue Tranquill, who is slated to be an unrestricted free agent when the new league year begins on Wednesday.Despite spending most of last year's offseason trying to upgrade its defense, Los Angeles finished the season ranked 20th.Kendricks grew up in Fresno and played at UCLA.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/3/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834254,Russia invited to participate in Central Asian soccer event,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Russia has been invited to participate in the inaugural Central Asian Football Association Championships in June along with seven other national teams.Russian teams have been barred from European and FIFA competitions since the invasion of Ukraine in February of last year. But the Tajikistan Football Association announced Monday that a Russian team could join the new regional tournament along with former Soviet republics Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Kyrgyzstan.Afghanistan, Iran and another country, yet to be confirmed, will complete the lineup for the games expected to be hosted in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan and Tashkent, Uzbekistan.The Central Asian Football Association was formed in 2014 as one of five regions within the Asian soccer confederation and has headquarters in Tajikistan. It held the CAFA women’s championship and junior age championships last year.According to the Tajikistan Football Association, Russia has already accepted the invitation for the men's event in June. But the Russian Football Union told state media: “We are currently in discussions about the possibility and conditions of the Russian national team’s participation in this tournament.”The move will rekindle debate about a possible Russian entry into the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) as the country seeks to return to international soccer competition.In January, Russian Football Union president Alexander Dyukov drew back from a December threat to join the AFC after meeting with European football officials.No resolution has yet been found. Dyukov last month attended the AFC Congress in Bahrain, holding talks with AFC president Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa.“We have a good relationship with the Russian federation and with the rest of the European federations, and we are always in contact with the federations on all occasions,” Salman said after the meeting. “We want the best interests of the game as we seek to keep politics away from football.”Russia's national men's team played just three international friendlies in 2022, against Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. The team is scheduled to meet Iran and Iraq later this month.Most Olympic sports have excluded athletes from Russia and its ally Belarus since shortly after Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine. The IOC initially recommended excluding them on safety grounds but now says keeping the restrictions would be discriminatory.Last month 35 countries signed a statement criticizing the IOC plans to allow Russians and Belarusians to return to competition ahead of qualifying events for the 2024 Paris Olympics as neutral athletes without national symbols.__More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/14,,World

(AP) — The Carolina Hurricanes say forward Andrei Svechnikov will be out indefinitely with a knee injury.The 22-year-old Svechnikov injured his right knee on Saturday night in a loss to Vegas. In a statement Monday night, president and general manager Don Waddell said Svechnikov had an MRI and further consultation with doctors before the decision was made.Svechnikov is tied for second among team skaters with 55 points and third with 23 games.Carolina has been outscored 7-0 in its last two games.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834260,Taiwan to start deploying low earth orbit satellite network amid war risk,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwan is expected to deploy low-earth orbit satellite ground stations at around 700 sites nationwide by the end of next year amid growing concerns about internet access in a potential cross-strait conflict.The Cabinet has approved a two-year plan to boost the country’s digital resilience, Liberty Times wrote on Sunday (March 12), focusing on proof-of-concept testing of infrastructure to ensure undisrupted communication services.The digital ministry and national security branches will select 700 out of the 6,882 infrastructure sites for the implementation of the network, including hospitals and shelters. Due to budgetary reasons, the program can not cover all locations but mobile equipment could be brought in, CNA quoted Digital Ministry Audrey Tang (唐鳳) as saying.The main objective is to ensure that when a conflict occurs, communication services, including video conferencing, internet phone calls, and live broadcasting, remain available. This will allow the president to address the nation and the country to keep the communication channels open with allies such as the U.S. and Japan, officials explained.The move follows the severing of two submarine cables connecting Taiwan and its outlying Matsu islands last month, allegedly by Chinese vessels and disrupting the islands’ communications services. Protecting undersea cables has become a priority as Chunghwa Telecom reported 27 instances of cuts in Taiwan’s undersea cables over the past five years.The importance of uninterrupted internet connectivity has also been brought to the fore by the war in Ukraine. This has helped the war-battered country convey messages and garner international support.",2023/3/14,1264,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834267,Global bank stock rout deepens as SVB collapse fans crisis fears,"March 14 (Reuters) - Shockwaves from the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SIVB.O) pounded global bank stocks further on Tuesday as assurances from President Joe Biden and other policymakers did little to calm markets and prompted a rethink on the interest rate outlook.
Biden's efforts to reassure markets and depositors came after emergency U.S. measures to shore up banks by giving them access to additional funding failed to dispel investor worries about potential contagion to other lenders worldwide.
Banking stocks in Asia extended declines, with big Australian banks ANZ (ANZ.AX), Westpac (WBC.AX) and NAB (NAB.AX) all down more than 2% and Japan's banking subindex (.IBNKS.T) falling 6.7% in early trade to its lowest since December.
A furious race to reprice interest rate expectations also sent waves through markets as investors bet the Federal Reserve will be reluctant to hike next week.
""Even if the collapse of several mid-tier banks doesn’t develop into a full-blown systemic crisis, it will more than likely trigger a credit crunch,"" said Paul Ashworth, Chief North America Economist at Capital Economics.
Traders currently see a 50% chance of no rate hike at that meeting, with rate cuts priced in for the second half of the year. Early last week, a 25 basis-point hike was fully priced in, with a 70% chance seen of 50 basis points.
With investors fearing additional failures, major U.S. banks lost around $90 billion in stock market value on Monday, bringing their loss over the past three trading sessions to nearly $190 billion.
Regional U.S. banks were hit the hardest. Shares of First Republic Bank (FRC.N) tumbled more than 60% as news of fresh financing failed to reassure investors, and so did Western Alliance Bancorp (WAL.N) and PacWest Bancorp (PACW.O).
Europe's STOXX banking index (.SX7P) closed 5.7% lower. Germany's Commerzbank (CBKG.DE) fell 12.7% and Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) slid 9.6% to a record low.
Biden said his administration's actions meant ""Americans can have confidence that the banking system is safe,"" while also promising stiffer regulation after the biggest U.S. bank failure since the 2008 financial crisis.
""Your deposits will be there when you need them,"" he said.
ACCESS TO DEPOSITS
SVB's customers will have access to all their deposits from Monday and regulators set up a new facility to give banks access to emergency funds. The Fed made it easier for banks to borrow from it in emergencies.
U.S. bank regulators sought to reassure nervous customers on Monday who lined up outside SVB's Santa Clara, California, headquarters, offering coffee and donuts.
""Feel free to transact business as usual. We just ask for a little bit of time because of the volume,"" FDIC employee Luis Mayorga told waiting customers.
Regulators also moved swiftly to close New York's Signature Bank SBNY.O, which had come under pressure in recent days.
""A serious investigation needs to be undertaken on why the regulators missed red flags ... and what needs to be overhauled,"" said Mark Sobel, a former senior Treasury official and U.S. chair of Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum, a think tank.
FALLOUT
In the money markets, indicators of credit risk in the U.S. and euro zone banking systems edged up.
Emboldened by bets the Fed may have to slow its rate hikes, the price of gold, a popular safe-haven raced above the key $1,900 level.
Companies around the globe with SVB accounts rushed to assess the impact on their finances. In Germany, the central bank convened its crisis team to assess any fallout.
After marathon weekend talks, HSBC HSBA.L said it was buying the British arm of SVB for one pound ($1.21).
While SVB UK is small, its sudden demise prompted calls for government help for Britain's startup industry, and its heavily exposed biotech sector in particular.
UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said there was no concern about systemic risk.

The victims included Kaohsiung City Councillor Huang Jie (黃捷), Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Kao Chia-yu (高嘉瑜), and influencer Ili Cheng (鄭家純).Chu was arrested in October 2021 after police discovered the content on Telegram. He and Chuang were eventually sentenced to more than five year and three year sentences respectively for violating the Personal Data Protection Act, offenses of public demeanor, and aggravated defamation.In addition to the compensation orders issued on Monday and the prison sentences already handed down, the pair were previously ordered to pay damages of NT$5 million each to five of the most high-profile figures involved in the case for the “anxiety and severe mental trauma” caused. A further 21 victims also requested compensation, with two awarded NT$1 million last year, and one other NT$500,000.Following the case, legislative amendments approved in January increased jail time for profiting from the distribution of deepfake pornographic material. Jail sentences for the recording of and blackmail involving sexually explicit images were also increased, with sentences increasing by half if profit was involved.One of the victims, a Taiwanese influencer named Zamy (奎丁) responded to the news of the additional compensation orders with contempt, saying that the amount was humiliating to the victims. “Can’t you lock him up for longer?” she wrote in an Instagram story on Monday.According to a 2019 report, non-consensual deepfake pornography accounts for 96% of the deepfake videos online, and women represent the overwhelming majority of victims of deepfaked sexually explicit material. Governments around the world are facing difficulties combatting the rise in deepfake materials on the internet, as existing legal frameworks often lack mechanisms to target deepfake porn.",2023/3/14,1208,Society

However, on Monday (March 13), the 29-year-old man disappeared at around 11 a.m. and police contacted his family and began a search, reported UDN.Wu Jui-pao (吳瑞寶), deputy warden of the Ministry of Justice Department of Correction Changhua Prison, told the news service that Chu was sentenced to four years, one month, and five days. He started serving his sentence on Dec. 24, 2019, and it was set to end on Jan. 4, 2024.In 2021, due to good behavior, he was selected to perform work outside the prison. On Monday morning, Chu went to work at a glass factory in the Changhua Binhai Industrial Zone as usual, but when others were not paying attention during his lunch break, he fled the scene.According to the court's ruling, Chu is a repeat offender, having committed multiple thefts. He has reportedly stolen bicycles, delivery vans, prizes from crane game shops, items from floral design shops, cash from stores, and merchandise from convenience stores.From Aug. 10-20, 2019, alone, Chu committed 18 acts of theft. Although he claimed he only committed the thefts due to difficulty finding work because of his lack of schooling and that he was divorced, raising a daughter, and taking care of a handicapped mother, the court ruled that he did not express adequate remorse, and he did not respect other people's property rights.However, because he did not commit any violent crimes, the court sentenced him to four years, one month, and five days in prison.On Tuesday morning (March 14), officers from the Yuanlin station of the Changhua County Police Bureau arrested Chu, reported TVBS. They have since taken him to the police station for questioning.Photo shows Chu escaping from factory on Monday. (CIB photo)",2023/3/14,1310,Society
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834276,"Eyeing China, Biden and allies unveil nuclear-powered submarine plan for Australia","SAN DIEGO, March 13 (Reuters) - The United States, Australia and Britain on Monday unveiled details of a plan to provide Australia with nuclear-powered attack submarines from the early 2030s to counter China's ambitions in the Indo-Pacific.Addressing a ceremony at the U.S. naval base in San Diego, accompanied by Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, U.S. President Joe Biden called the agreement under the 2021 AUKUS partnership part of a shared commitment to a free-and-open Indo-Pacific region with two of America's ""most stalwart and capable allies.""Sunak called it ""a powerful partnership,"" adding: ""For the first time ever it will mean three fleets of submarines working together across the Atlantic and Pacific keeping our oceans free ... for decades to come.""Under the deal, the United States intends to sell Australia three U.S. Virginia class nuclear-powered submarines, which are built by General Dynamics, in the early 2030s, with an option for Australia to buy two more if needed, a joint statement said.It said the multi-stage project would culminate with British and Australian production and operation of a new submarine class - SSN-AUKUS - a ""trilaterally developed"" vessel based on Britain's next-generation design that would be built in Britain and Australia and include ""cutting edge"" U.S. technologies.Britain would take delivery of its first SSN-AUKUS submarine in the late 2030s, and Australia would receive its first in the early 2040s. The vessels will be built by BAE Systems and Rolls-Royce.""The AUKUS agreement we confirm here in San Diego represents the biggest single investment in Australia’s defence capability in our history, strengthening Australia’s national security and stability in our region,"" Albanese said at the ceremony.An Australian defense official said the project would cost A$368 billion ($245 billion) by 2055.AUKUS will be the first time Washington has shared nuclear-propulsion technology since it did so with Britain in the 1950s.Biden stressed that the submarines would be nuclear-powered, not nuclear armed: ""These boats will not have nuclear weapons of any kind on them,"" he said.China has condemned AUKUS as an illegal act of nuclear proliferation. In launching the partnership, Australia also upset France by abruptly cancelling a deal to buy French conventional submarines.Asked if he was worried China would see the AUKUS submarine deal as aggression, Biden replied ""no."" He said he expected to speak to Chinese leader Xi Jinping soon, but would not say when.U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan pointed on Friday to Beijing's own military buildup, including nuclear-powered submarines, saying: ""We have communicated with them about AUKUS and sought more information from them about their intentions.""Australia offered China a briefing on the submarine deal but was not aware of any response from Beijing, Australian Defence Minister Richard Marles said.The agreement will see U.S. and British submarines deployed in Western Australia as soon as 2027 to help train Australian crews and bolster deterrence. U.S. officials said this would involve four U.S. submarines and one British in a few years.This first phase of the plan is already underway with the U.S. Virginia-class nuclear-powered attack submarine Asheville visiting Perth in Western Australia, officials said.BIG QUESTIONS AND HUGE INVESTMENTA senior U.S. official said AUKUS reflected mounting Indo-Pacific threats, not just from China towards self-ruled Taiwan and in the contested South China Sea, but also from Russia, which has conducted joint exercises with China, and North Korea as well.Big questions remain about AUKUS, not least over strict U.S. curbs on the extensive technology sharing needed for the project and about how long it will take to deliver the submarines, even as the perceived threat posed by China mounts.In a reflection of stretched U.S. production capacity, a second senior U.S. official told Reuters it was ""very likely"" one or two of the Virginia-class submarines sold to Australia would be vessels that had been in U.S. service, something that would require congressional approval.Analysts said that given China's growing power and threats to reunify with Taiwan by force if necessary, it was vital to advance the second stage of AUKUS, which involves hypersonics and other weaponry that can be deployed more quickly.British and Australian officials said this month work was still needed to break down bureaucratic barriers to technology sharing and Monday's announcement did not cover this second stage.The second U.S. official said Australia would contribute to boosting U.S. and British submarine production and maintenance capacity.He said Washington was looking at ""double digit billion"" investment in its submarine industrial base on top of $4.6 billion already committed for 2023-29 and that the Australian contribution would be less than 15 percent of the total.Albanese said he expected AUKUS would result in A$6 billion invested in Australia’s industrial capability over the next four years and create around 20,000 direct jobs over the next 30. He said it would require funding amounting to around 0.15% of GDP per year.Britain, which left the European Union in 2020, says AUKUS will help boost its economy's low growth rate. Sunak said AUKUS was ""binding ties to our closest allies and delivering security, new technology and economic advantage at home.""",2023/3/14,245,World

Irving has right foot soreness.With all three absent just as they were in Memphis' 112-108 victory Saturday to start the home-and-home, rookie David Roddy played a big role for the Grizzlies again.The 23rd overall draft pick scored 19 points on 8-of-11 shooting two nights after getting 17 of his career-high 24 points in the fourth quarter, when Memphis erased an 11-point deficit.There was no need for a late rally in the rematch after the Grizzlies opened the second half with a 12-0 run and outscored Dallas 36-21 in the third quarter, when the Mavs shot 31%.“I challenged the guys at halftime to understand we had just beaten this team two days ago,” Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said. “They were going to come in with a reinvigorated spirit to try to beat us on their home floor.”Rookie Jaden Hardy scored 28 points for the Mavericks, who dropped under .500 for the first time since December. Josh Green was the only other Dallas player in double figures with 23.The Mavs, who paired Irving with Doncic by giving up two starters and a first-round pick in the blockbuster trade with Brooklyn, are currently in the play-in tournament with 13 games remaining a year after reaching the Western Conference finals.“We’ve got to play with the cards we had tonight, and we played a good half of basketball with a young backcourt that’s learning how to play the NBA game,” Dallas coach Jason Kidd said. “It's just a matter of can we be healthy in time to make a stretch run. And if we’re not, that’s just the season. No one’s dying.”The Grizzlies, comfortably in the top six in the West, won a third consecutive game after losing the first two of Morant's sabbatical.Morant is away from the team after posting a video recently in which the 23-year-old two-time All-Star appeared to be displaying a gun at a Denver-area strip club.“We've had internal dialogue for sure,” Bane said. “We knew roles would be different and guys that maybe didn't have an opportunity before we're going to get one. Guys have been staying ready all year long.”MORE MISSING PIECESBoth teams also were missing a key frontcourt player, with Memphis' Steven Adams out with a right knee sprain and Dallas' Christian Wood scratched before the game because of right foot soreness.ROLLING RODDYRoddy, who played three seasons at Colorado State, now has the two highest-scoring games of his career in consecutive outings. He was a 42% shooter before making 18 of 24 from the field in these two games.“He made some big ones in Memphis and maybe we should have run him off, but understanding running him of puts us in a bind,” Kidd said.TIP-INSGrizzlies: Dillon Brooks scored 19 points, and Santi Aldama had 10 points and nine rebounds. ... Memphis ended a three-game road losing streak and won for just the second time in 13 games away from home.Mavericks: Hardy's 16-point first quarter was the highest-scoring opening quarter for a rookie in the NBA this season, surpassing Jeremy Sochan's 15 points for San Antonio in 127-106 loss to Washington in January. ... Tim Hardaway Jr., who had 23 points with Doncic and Irving sidelined in the first meeting, scored just five points on 2-of-10 shooting.UP NEXTGrizzlies: At Miami on Wednesday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834305,Puerto Rico pitchers perfect in 8-inning WBC win vs Israel,"MIAMI (AP) — José De León and three relievers combined on a perfect pitching performance as Puerto Rico routed Israel 10-0 in a World Baseball Classic matchup called after eight innings Monday night because of the tournament’s 10-run mercy rule.Yacksel Ríos, Edwin Díaz and Duane Underwood Jr. closed out the win for Puerto Rico, which did not permit a baserunner. But it will not count as a perfect game in official WBC records because the game didn't go a full nine innings.That's the standard established by the Elias Sports Bureau, the official statistician for Major League Baseball.Still, it was a dominant bounce-back victory for Puerto Rico, a day after its late rally fell short in a disappointing 9-6 loss to Venezuela.""Very happy for the guys, especially after what happened Sunday,” Puerto Rico manager Yadier Molina said in Spanish. “To come out aggressively and win the game the way we did makes me very proud.”De León tied a WBC record with 10 strikeouts in 5 2/3 innings, earning the win. The right-hander was lifted after he fanned Spencer Horwitz on his 64th pitch, one under the tournament limit for starting pitchers in the first round. He exited to a huge ovation from the prohibitive Puerto Rico crowd of 27,813.Afterward, he got the game ball and had it signed by his teammates.“I dreamt about a moment like this,"" De León said. “After all the setbacks I faced, I deserved this type of moment. I wanted to let the public know I am here to stay and also show the world that José De León still can compete.”De León represented Puerto Rico in the 2017 WBC but has struggled with injuries since. In 2018, he had Tommy John surgery to repair a torn ulnar collateral ligament in his right elbow after he got hurt in spring training with Tampa Bay.“It is a great moment for all of us but especially for him,” Molina said, “with his family being here and what he has gone through in his career. I’m very happy with his outing. I know José very well and have worked with him. He deserves all of this.”Ríos relieved De León and struck out his only batter to end the sixth.With his team up 9-0 in the seventh, Molina turned to Díaz, the New York Mets' star closer, and he fanned one hitter in a 1-2-3 inning. Underwood retired Israel in order on 10 pitches in the eighth.Javier Báez doubled twice and Francisco Lindor tripled and singled for Puerto Rico, which finished with 11 hits and improved to 2-1.Puerto Rico struck quickly against Israel starter Colton Gordon with a three-run first. Báez hit a two-run double and scored on Eddie Rosario’s double.The extra-base hits continued for Puerto Rico in the second, resulting in another three runs. Kiké Hernández made it 5-0 with a two-run double and raced home on Emmanuel Rivera’s triple.Lindor’s two-run triple keyed a three-run fifth.In the eighth, Hernández’s single to left field drove in Martin Maldonado and ended the game.“My first perfect game.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834306,"Edwards scores 32, Timberwolves beat Hawks 136-115","ATLANTA (AP) — Anthony Edwards scored 32 points in his hometown, Kyle Anderson had his third career triple-double and the Minnesota Timberwolves cruised to a 136-115 victory over the Atlanta Hawks on Monday night.“It’s the first time I’ve beaten Atlanta, and it’s in Atlanta, so I’m super happy,” Edwards said. “I’m at a loss for words.”Trae Young finished with 41 points for the Hawks, who dropped to 3-5 under new coach Quin Snyder and have lost four of six. Atlanta went 4 for 22 beyond the arc and handed out 17 assists compared to 39 for Minnesota.Edwards, a former No. 1 overall draft pick who starred at Georgia and grew up in Atlanta, dazzled with several dunks, one of which put the Timberwolves up 91-67 midway through the third quarter. The lead soon swelled to a game-high 28 on a layup by Mike Conley, who finished with 21 points.Anderson scored 12 of his 14 points in the third and had 12 assists and 10 rebounds for Minnesota, which snapped a two-game skid. Jaden McDaniels scored 19 points.Edwards praised Anderson's awareness.“Every time that they made a run, he’d do something,” Edwards said. “He just knows the game. He makes it look so easy. Basketball, he knows the ins and outs.”Atlanta went on a 19-7 run to trim the lead to 13 with 7 minutes to go, but Edwards hit an alley-oop layup to push the lead back to 17 at the 6:19 mark, and the Hawks never closed within single digits.Edwards had a pair of 3s late in the fourth quarter to close out his third straight 30-point game.“They kept making runs,” he said. “In the third quarter they made a run at the end and the beginning of the fourth they made a run, so I knew I was going to have to check back in.”This matchup of teams that entered at 34-34 was all but decided early as the Timberwolves went on a 19-4 run to take a 31-17 lead in the first on Edwards’ layup at the 3:33 mark. Due in part to six Atlanta turnovers, Minnesota had a 13-0 advantage in fast-break points that early in the game. The Hawks gave up 40 points in the first quarter and trailed 51-31 on Jordan McLaughlin’s 3 early in the second.“We started the game out wrong,” Young said. “I think that just set the tone. I’ve got to do better to start the game.”The Timberwolves led 76-52 at halftime after the Hawks let the shot clock expire on their last offensive possession and Edwards hit two of three free throws with 1 second to go.Edwards said he had ''no idea"" how many family members and friends came to watch him play. He was grateful to put on a good show and come out with a win.“It’s dope. I play for the Minnesota Timberwolves and to come back to Atlanta and they still cheer for me,” the All-Star guard said. “I mean I was getting booed at the free throw line, but other than that it was dope to be around a lot of my family.""TIP-INSTimberwolves: Rudy Gobert was a game-time decision with a left ankle sprain. He entered averaging 16.7 points on 66.1% shooting, 11.2 rebounds and 1.2 blocks since the All-Star break. He finished with 14 points, eight rebounds and three blocks. ...

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834307,"Jimmy Butler scores 24, Heat hold off Jazz 119-115","MIAMI (AP) — Another night, another close game for Miami.Jimmy Butler scored 24 points to lead seven Miami players in double figures, Tyler Herro and Gabe Vincent each scored 18 and the Heat held off the Utah Jazz 119-115 on Monday night.It was Miami's 24th win by five points or less this season.“When it gets into those moments of truth, I’ve said this before, at least we understand what our package is and what we’re trying to do, how we want to execute,” Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. “We’ve had so many reps and film sessions and walkthroughs and teaching points ... I think we’ve all gotten better from that, including the coaching staff.”Bam Adebayo scored 16 for Miami, while Victor Oladipo and Kevin Love each had 11 and Caleb Martin scored 10.Lauri Markkanen scored 38 for Utah, which got 23 from Simone Fontecchio and 14 from Ochai Agbaji. Miami was 31 for 36 from the foul line, compared with 13 for 18 for the Jazz.“We can still get better,"" Markkanen said. “Obviously, they made some good shots too, so credit to them.”Talen Horton-Tucker put Utah on top with a short jumper with 1:16 left, and Herro gave Miami the lead right back on a 3-pointer with 55.3 seconds remaining. It stayed a two-point game until the final seconds; Agbaji missed a short shot in the lane that was blocked by Adebayo, who got the rebound, then was fouled and made two free throws with six seconds left to seal the win.Clutch games are defined by the NBA as those within five points with five minutes remaining in regulation, and nobody has played more of them this season than Miami and Utah. This was the 50th for the Heat, the 46th for the Jazz.And this was so on brand for both teams.There were 13 lead changes in the fourth quarter alone, after there were only five of them — and five ties — in the first 36 minutes. Miami is now 28-22 in clutch games, Utah 20-26.""As long as it's a close game and we end up winning in the end, I'm happy, I'm content with that,"" Butler said. “We've just got to string together some wins, now more than ever, which we are capable of. So let's make it happen.”The win also gave Miami a bit of breathing room over Atlanta in the race for the No. 7 spot in the Eastern Conference. The Hawks (34-35) lost to Minnesota while Miami (37-33) moved 2 1/2 games ahead of Atlanta — and Miami also owns the tiebreaker if necessary.TIP-INSJazz: Former Miami forward Kelly Olynyk, a starter for the Jazz, got the traditionally warm introduction reserved for past Heat players — instead of a far-more-subdued announcement that most everyone else gets when lineups were announced. ... Utah now has four full days off — a rarity in the NBA outside of the All-Star break — then resumes play Saturday against Boston.Heat: Cody Zeller (broken nose) did not play. He got hurt Saturday at Orlando. ... Caleb Martin (left knee soreness) played after sitting out Saturday. ... Vincent remained in the starting lineup, with Kyle Lowry coming off the bench at point guard.2 WITH 20Markkanen (21) and Fontecchio (20) were the first Jazz teammates to have at least 20 points by halftime since Donovan Mitchell and Jordan Clarkson did it against the Los Angeles Clippers on June 18, 2021, in a playoff contest.MORE POINTSMiami was last in the NBA in scoring (108.3 points per game) at the All-Star break and remains last. But since the break, there has been improvement; the Heat are 22nd in the league in scoring (110.7 ppg) since All-Star weekend. “We’re slowly starting to put more points on the board, which is a good thing,” Spoelstra said. But Butler noted that Miami now needs to tighten up on defense — while keeping the additional scoring.UP NEXTJazz: Host Boston on Saturday.Heat: Host Memphis on Wednesday.___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834308,AP source: Seahawks reach deal with DL Dre'Mont Jones,"RENTON, Wash. (AP) — Traditionally quiet during the initial days of free agency, the Seattle Seahawks made a big splash on Monday, agreeing to a contract with defensive lineman Dre’Mont Jones, according to a person with knowledge of the deal.The person confirmed the agreement to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because it can’t be announced until Wednesday.NFL Network and The Score reported the deal is for three years and up to $51 million.Seattle has often been a passive observer to the initial days of the free agency frenzy. But the chance to get Jones appeared to change the Seahawks' approach.The 26-year-old Jones is the first piece of what could end up being an overhaul of the interior of Seattle's defensive line.Jones had a career-high 47 tackles and matched his career high with 6 1/2 sacks despite missing four games last season for Denver. Jones has recorded 18 1/3 sacks in 42 games over the past three seasons, and getting more production and pressure from the interior of the defensive line was an offseason priority for Seattle.Jones was a third-round pick by the Broncos out of Ohio State in 2019 and progressively got better during his four seasons in Denver. He should be a major contributor for Seattle, especially with the Seahawks using a similar defensive system.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/3/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834309,Lehkonen scores 2 as Avalanche beat Canadiens 8-4,"MONTREAL (AP) — Artturi Lehkonen scored twice in Colorado's four-goal first period, and the Avalanche beat the Montreal Canadiens 8-4 Monday night.Valeri Nichushkin had a goal and two assists, Mikko Rantanen had a goal and an assist, and Nathan MacKinnon, J.T. Compher, Matt Nieto and Bowen Byram also scored for the Avalanche, who won for the third time in four games.Cale Makar had three assists, and Devon Toews and Logan O'Connor each had two. Alexandar Georgiev finished with 15 saves.“I thought the pace that we played with in the first period and the execution was phenomenal,” Avalanche coach Jared Bednar said. “Not that we created a ton of chances but the chances that we did create were good ones and our guys did a nice job capitalizing on some nice moves and some good shots.”Josh Anderson had a goal and an assist, and Chris Wideman, Mike Matheson and Denis Gurianov also scored as the Canadiens lost their seventh straight (0-5-2). Nick Suzuki had two assists.Jake Allen started in goal and was pulled early in the second quarter after giving up six goals on 15 shots. Sam Montembault came on and finished with 16 saves.“I think our group has played very hard in a very hard, heavy schedule and they’ve been engaged,” Canadiens coach Martin St. Louis said. “Tonight wasn’t our best but I’m just going to move on and focus on (Tuesday’s game against Pittsburgh).”Lehkonen, Byram and Nieto scored 5:06 apart to give the Avalanche a 3-0 lead a little more than eight minutes into the game. Lehkonen converted on a power play for his second of the night and 20th of the season with four minutes left in the first to make it 4-0.It was also the 100th career goal for the forward traded from Montreal to Colorado a year ago.“One hundred goals for him, that’s a big accolade to have,” O’Connor said. “Two (goals) in front of the net tonight, coming back to Montreal for the first time, it’s definitely a special night for him so it’s awesome to see.”His first goal came moments after a video tribute, and Canadiens fans erupted in response.“Everybody loves him. He’s such an awesome dude and a great friend,” Makar said. “I don’t know if I’ve ever heard a fan base cheer for one guy on another team when he scores. So that was a pretty cool experience.”Anderson deflected Johnathan Kovacevic's shot past Georgiev to get Montreal on the scoreboard with 1:02 left in the opening period. It was his 20th.“The good thing about the first is we stopped the bleeding at the end,” St. Louis said. “We got a late one, it gave us a little life and we showed them a couple of things that can help us and why we were hurting ourselves.”Rantanen scored his 43 and Compher had his 14th to push Colorado's lead to 6-1 at 3:58 of the second, ending Allen's night.Gurianov had a power-play goal with 42 seconds left in the middle period to pull the Canadiens within four.MacKinnon scored his 29th for the Avalanche's second of three power-play goals of the game to make it 7-2 at 8:09 of the third.Wideman scored his first of the season 39 seconds later and Matheson got his sixth with 9:25 left to cut Montreal's deficit to three.Nichushkin deflected Makar's point shot from between the circles down out of the air and past Montembault with 6:51 remaining.LEHKONEN INJUREDLehkonen’s night came to a bitter end when he left 12:57 into the second period.Bednar said the forward broke a finger while taking a shot to the hand.“He’ll leave (Tuesday) from Toronto to head back and then follow up with surgery the next day,” Bednar said.UP NEXTAvalanche: At Toronto on Wednesday night in the second of a four-game trip.Canadiens: At Pittsburgh on Tuesday night in the opener of a three-game trip.___AP NHL: https://www.apnews.com/hub/NHL and https://www.twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/14,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834317,"Jalen Green scores 28, Rockets outlast Celtics 111-109","HOUSTON (AP) — Jalen Green scored 28 points and rookie Jabari Smith Jr. added 24 as the Houston Rockets withstood a late charge to beat the Boston Celtics 111-109 on Monday night.The Rockets, who are tied with Detroit for the NBA’s fewest wins with 16, snapped a three-game skid despite allowing the Celtics' Jaylen Brown to score a season-high 43 points.“My biggest thing that we were saying was we need to stay together, calm down, slow down, stay under control,” Green said. “So I think we did that and it paid off.”Boston, which is second in the Eastern Conference, trailed by 11 with about 4 1/2 minutes to go before using a late run to get within striking distance. Brown made two free throws to cut Houston’s lead to one with less than a minute left.Kenyon Martin Jr. missed a 3-point attempt after that but grabbed his own rebound. Green was fouled with 10 seconds to go and made both free throws.Brown made a layup to get Boston within one again. Smith then made one of two free throws. The Celtics had a chance to tie it at the buzzer, but Jayson Tatum missed a layup.“I thought it was a good, well-executed play,” Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla said. “Just couldn't make a tough layup.”Rockets coach Stephen Silas said his young team showed progress after some recent losses in which it let things get away late.“We’re a work in progress, but when we understand the moment, it’s gratifying as a coach for sure,” he said. “We’re constantly teaching them, but they need to feel it. And as much as we can watch film and as much as we can talk about it ... there’s no better teaching method than going through it and finding some success at the end of it.”Tatum scored 22 points for Boston and Malcolm Brogdon added 20.Martin had 20 points and eight rebounds for Houston and Kevin Porter Jr. had 14 points and 13 assists.The Celtics made four free throws before getting a three-point play from Brogdon to get within two with less than two minutes remaining. Jae’Sean Tate fouled Marcus Smart on the free throw by Brogdon and Smart made a free throw to cut the lead to 106-105.A layup by Sam Hauser after a steal by Brogdon got the Celtics within a basket early in the fourth quarter. But the Rockets got consecutive 3s from Usman Garuba to start a 9-2 run that extended their advantage to 98-89 with about seven minutes to go.The Rockets led by seven at halftime and used a 7-0 run to make it 71-58 with about 8 1/2 minutes left in the third. Later in the period, Boston cut the lead to 75-68 thanks to an 8-2 spurt in which Tatum scored all the Celtics' points.TIP-INSCeltics: Robert Williams was out for a fifth straight game with a strained left hamstring. ... Payton Pritchard was inactive for a third consecutive game with left heel pain. … Boston made 12 of 42 3-pointers.Rockets: Porter hobbled off the court in the fourth quarter but returned a couple minutes later. ... Alperen Sengun missed the game with a left groin strain. Silas said the injury wasn’t serious and he expects Sengun to return for the next game. ... Houston outrebounded Boston 48-38.SMITH'S PROGRESSSmith, who was the third overall pick in the 2022 draft, has scored at least 20 points in three straight games after doing so just seven times in his first 62 games.“He's going crazy right now,” Green said. “He's in that mode. I'm happy for him because we know the real Jabari and he's showing it right now to everybody, everyone who doubted him.”UP NEXTCeltics: Continue a six-game trip with a visit to Minnesota on Wednesday night.Rockets: Host the Los Angeles Lakers on Wednesday night.___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834318,Tuch scores 2 as Sabres rally to beat Maple Leafs 4-3,"TORONTO (AP) — Alex Tuch had two goals in his return from injury and the Buffalo Sabres rallied from two goals down to beat the Toronto Maple Leafs 4-3 on Monday night.Jack Quinn and Dylan Cozens also scored for Buffalo, and Owen Power and JJ Peterka each had two assists for Buffalo. Craig Anderson had 25 saves as the Sabres won for just the second time in eight games (2-5-1).“Stayed patient,” said Tuch, who missed eight games with a lower-body injury, but has six goals and three assists in his last six appearances dating back to Feb. 15. “We just stuck to it.”Auston Matthews had a goal and two assists, and William Nylander and Calle Jarnkrok also scored for Toronto. Mitch Marner had two assists and Matt Murray stopped 25 shots.The Maple Leafs are all but assure of finishing second in the Atlantic Division, while the Sabres are trying to stay in contention for a wild card in the Eastern Conference.“There’s enough to play for here, right?” Maple Leafs coach Sheldon Keefe said. “It’s still tight enough (in the standings) that if you let your foot off the gas, not only are you now losing home ice, but you’ve got other teams (chasing).”After falling behind 2-0 early in the second period, the Sabres scored four consecutive goals over a 27-minute stretch.“We’ve made defending a greater focal point,” Sabres coach Don Granato said. “Our guys recognized tonight ways they could impact it more and more as the game went along.”Quinn batting the puck past Murray for the rookie forward’s 13th to get the Sabres on the scoreboard with 5:02 left in the second.Anderson made a nice breakaway stop on Nylander on Toronto’s next shot early in the third — the Leafs went over 17 minutes without testing the Sabres’ goalie — before Tuch tied things at 3:39.Murray denied Tage Thompson on a break to keep Toronto level, but Cozens gave Buffalo a 3-2 lead near the midpoint of the period for his 26th.With the Sabres on a power play, Tuch converted a pass from Jeff Skinner with 8:41 left for his second of the night and first 30-goal season.The Maple Leafs finally woke up as the period wore on, but Anderson stopped Michael Bunting on a 2-on-0 with John Tavares. Nylander scored his 35th from a tight angle with 1:01 remaining, but that’s as close as Toronto would come despite a wild final few seconds.“I think 50/50 battles, just a little bit careless with the puck,” Matthews said about where things turned for Toronto. “They tilted the ice their way and now we’re just kind of chasing from that point.”Playing his 38th career game against the Maple Leafs, Anderson was also sharp in a first period that included a couple of good looks for Matthews, who came in with 13 goals in 16 contests against the 41-year-old.But Matthews eventually connected early in the second. After Marner and Alexander Kerfoot moved in on a 2-on-1, the latter booted the puck with his skate into the path of Matthews for him to chip his 31st upstairs.Jarnkrok then doubled the advantage just over three minutes later whenANTHEM AUDIBLEA sound issue at Scotiabank Arena meant there was no audio for the playing of “The Star-Spangled Banner” prior to puck drop, but fans stepped in a cappella-style and belted out the U.S. national anthem before the problem was fixed in time for “O Canada.”TUCH’S RETURNTuch was back in the lineup after an eight-game absence with a lower-body injury.“Not great timing,” Tuch said following the morning skating of being on the shelf with Buffalo desperately trying to stay in the playoff chase.UP NEXTSabres: At Washington on Wednesday night in the middle game of a three-game series.Maple Leafs: Host Colorado on Wednesday night in the third of a four-game homestand.___AP NHL: https://www.apnews.com/hub/NHL and https://www.twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/14,,World

Beijing stopped quarantine requirements for visitors, but visa restrictions were still kept in place.It also then resumed issuing Chinese passports for ""tourism"" or ""overseas visits of friends.""According to figures from the UN's World Tourism Organization, China had 65.7 million international travelers in 2019, before the pandemic.

Parliamentarians from Kosovo (in Taiwan for the first trip of its kind), North Macedonia and Romania were in attendance.You said that throughout history, Taiwan’s people have “hardly ever been their own masters,” referencing the country’s long history of colonial rule. “The freedom and democracy enjoyed by Taiwanese people now… has come from oppression and massacres, and it was watered by the blood and tears of the martyrs and those who came before,” adding that Taiwan’s democracy “promises to help people under the rule of other authoritarian countries enjoy freedom.”Chairman of Citizen Congress Watch Tseng Chien-yuan said his group’s 15-year history will come together with other groups in attendance to share more than a century's worth of expertise in developing sustainable democratic mechanisms. Tseng said that the main challenges to Asia’s democratic institutions were authoritarian rise, digital misinformation, and geopolitical influences.Panel discussions held over the two-day event will feature former Kosovo Prime Minister Avdullah Hoti, member of the Romanian House of Representatives Catalin D.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834364,"Former Rep. Pat Schroeder, pioneer for women's rights, dies","WASHINGTON (AP) — Former U.S. Rep. Pat Schroeder, a pioneer for women’s and family rights in Congress, has died. She was 82.Schroeder's former press secretary, Andrea Camp, said Schroeder suffered a stroke recently and died Monday night at a hospital in Celebration, Florida, the city where she had been residing in recent years.Schroeder took on the powerful elite with her rapier wit and antics for 24 years, shaking up stodgy government institutions by forcing them to acknowledge that women had a role in government.Her unorthodox methods cost her important committee posts, but Schroeder said she wasn’t willing to join what she called “the good old boys’ club” just to score political points. Unafraid of embarrassing her congressional colleagues in public, she became an icon for the feminist movement.President Joe Biden paid tribute in a statement Tuesday, saying: “On issue after issue, Pat stood up for basic fairness, sensible policy, and women’s equal humanity. The result was a legislative record that changed millions of women’s lives — and men’s lives — for the better.”Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the former House speaker, said, “Her courage and persistence leave behind an indelible legacy of progress and have inspired countless women in public service to follow in her footsteps.”Schroeder was elected to Congress in Colorado in 1972 and became one of its most influential Democrats as she won easy reelection 11 times from her safe district in Denver. Despite her seniority, she was never appointed to head a committee.Schroeder helped forge several Democratic majorities before deciding in 1997 it was time to leave. Her parting shot in 1998 was a book titled “24 Years of Housework ... and the Place is Still a Mess. My Life in Politics,″ which chronicled her frustration with male domination and the slow pace of change in federal institutions.In 1987, Schroeder tested the waters for the presidency, mounting a fundraising drive after fellow Coloradan Gary Hart pulled out of the race. She announced three months later that she would not run and said her “tears signify compassion, not weakness.” Her heart was not in it, she said, and she thought fundraising was demeaning.She was the first woman on the House Armed Services Committee but was forced to share a chair with U.S. Rep. Ron Dellums, D-Calif., the first African American, when committee chairman F. Edward Hebert, D-La., organized the panel. Schroeder said Hebert thought the committee was no place for a woman or an African American and they were each worth only half a seat.Republicans were livid after Schroeder and others filed an ethics complaint over House Speaker Newt Gingrich’s televised college lecture series, charging that free cable time he received amounted to an illegal gift under House rules. Gingrich became the first speaker reprimanded by Congress. Gingrich said later he regretted not taking Schroeder and her colleagues more seriously.Earlier, she had blasted Gingrich for suggesting women shouldn’t serve in combat because they could get infections from being in a ditch for 30 days. According to her official House biography, she once told Pentagon officials that if they were women, they would always be pregnant because they never said “no.″Asked by one congressman how she could be a mother of two small children and a member of Congress at the same time, she replied, “I have a brain and a uterus, and I use both.""It was Schroeder who branded President Ronald Reagan the Teflon president for his ability to avoid blame for major policy decisions, and the name stuck.One of Schroeder’s biggest victories was the signing of a family leave bill in 1993, providing job protection for care of a newborn, a sick child or a parent.“Pat Schroeder blazed the trail. Every woman in this house is walking in her footsteps,” said Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., who took over from Schroeder as Democratic chair of the bipartisan congressional caucus on women’s issues.Schroeder said legislators spent too much attention on contributors and special interests. When House Republicans gathered on the U.S. Capitol steps to celebrate their first 100 days in power in 1994, she and several aides clambered to the building’s dome and hung a 15-foot red banner reading, “Sold.”A pilot, Schroeder earned her way through Harvard Law School with her own flying service. Schroeder became a professor at Princeton University after leaving Congress but said politics was in her blood and she would continue working for candidates she supported.For a while, she taught a graduate-level course titled “The Politics of Poverty.” She also headed the Association of American Publishers.Schroeder continued working in politics after moving to Florida, going door to door, speaking to groups and mentoring candidates. She was politically active for issues and candidates across the country and campaigned for Hillary Clinton in 2016. Among other activities she served on the board of the Marguerite Casey Foundation.Schroeder was born in Portland, Oregon, on July 30, 1940. She graduated from the University of Minnesota before earning her law degree in 1964. From 1964 to 1966, she was a field attorney for the National Labor Relations Board.She is survived by her husband, James W. Schroeder, whom she married in 1962. Also surviving are their two children, Scott and Jamie, and her brother, Mike Scott, as well as four grandchildren.___Former Associated Press writer Steven K.

Sam Darnold is heading out West, where he'll replace Garoppolo and join Trey Lance and Brock Purdy with the 49ers. Mike White, Case Keenum and Jarrett Stidham have new teams, too.Deshaun Watson is staying in Cleveland, but with a restructured deal with the Browns.As for Aaron Rodgers, who is not a free agent but whose name has widely been circulated in trade rumors, his future remains unclear because, well, he's Aaron Rodgers.Quarterbacks took center stage on Monday as NFL free agency began with teams allowed to negotiate — and agree to deals — with unrestricted free agents. The deals can't be announced until Wednesday and therefore were confirmed to The Associated Press by people speaking on condition of anonymity.Garoppolo was the highest-profile QB to change teams.He agreed to a three-year, $67.5 million contract with Las Vegas, where he'll replace Derek Carr, who signed with the New Orleans Saints earlier this offseason after being cut by the Raiders. Garoppolo’s contract includes $34 million in guaranteed money.White is staying within the AFC East, leaving the New York Jets for the Miami Dolphins to back up Tua Tagovailoa. Keenum is rejoining the Houston Texans, where he went 0-8 as a starter back in 2013. Stidham is going to Denver to back up Russell Wilson.The Browns restructured Watson's record-setting guaranteed $230 million contract to create salary cap space.But the day wasn't just about quarterbacks. Several other big-name players agreed to join new franchises.The Broncos were among the big spenders on Monday, addressing their offensive line by agreeing on a five-year, $87.5 million control with tackle Mike McGlinchey from the 49ers and a four-year, $52 million deal with guard Ben Powers from the Baltimore Ravens. Denver later agreed with former Arizona Cardinals defensive end Zach Allen on a $45.75 million, three-year deal.But the Broncos couldn't keep everyone.The Seattle Seahawks agreed to terms with former Broncos defensive lineman Dre’Mont Jones, a deal reported to be worth $51 million over three years.As usual, the first day of free agency negotiations meant some players cashed in.Defensive tackle Javon Hargrave got a four-year, $84 million contract from the 49ers, adding more talent to what was already considered one of the best defenses in the league, and Jawaan Taylor will become Patrick Mahomes' new blindside protector after agreeing to an $80 million, four-year contract with the Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs.Former Cincinnati Bengals safety Jessie Bates got a four-year, $64 million deal from the Atlanta Falcons. Bates, an All-Pro in 2020, started 79 games in five seasons with the Bengals and had 14 interceptions, forced three fumbles and recovered two.The Bengals' other free agent safety, Vonn Bell, signed with the Panthers.The Chicago Bears made two big additions at linebacker, agreeing to contracts with two-time Buffalo Bills Pro Bowler Tremaine Edmunds and former Philadelphia Eagle T.J. Edwards. Edmunds’ deal is worth $72 million over four years with $50 million guaranteed.The New York Giants agreed on a four-year, $40 million contract with linebacker Bobby Okereke. Okereke spent his first four season in Indianapolis, where he started 49 games and had a career-high 151 tackles with six tackles for loss, five pass breakups, two forced fumbles and two fumble recoveries last season.And the Pittsburgh Steelers landed cornerback Patrick Peterson.Even some kickers got paid, with Greg Zuerlein agreeing to re-sign with the New York Jets.Plenty of quality unrestricted free agents remain unsigned, including wide receivers Odell Beckham Jr., Jakobi Meyers and JuJu Smith-Schuster, offensive tackle Orlando Brown, cornerback James Bradberry and linebackers Bobby Wagner and Lavonte David.___AP Pro Football Writers Rob Maaddi, Josh Dubow and Dennis Waszak Jr., and AP Sports Writers Mark Anderson, Alanis Thames, Tom Withers, Dave Skretta and Andrew Seligman contributed to this report.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/3/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834371,"AP sources: Vikings reach deals with DE Davenport, TE Oliver","MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The Minnesota Vikings ramped up their pass rush and run blocking on Monday by agreeing to terms with former New Orleans defensive end Marcus Davenport and former Baltimore tight end Josh Oliver, according to two different people with direct knowledge of each deal.The people confirmed the agreements to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because free agent contracts can't be finalized until the new league year begins on Wednesday.Davenport agreed to a one-year, $13 million contract, the person with knowledge of his deal said. Oliver agreed to a three-year, $21 million contract with $10.75 million in guaranteed money and attainable incentives that would push the total value to $24 million, the person with knowledge of his deal said.The 26-year-old Davenport was the 14th overall pick in the 2018 draft by the Saints, but he had trouble staying healthy. The 6-foot-6, 265-pound Davenport had a career-high nine sacks in just 11 games in 2021, but he only had a half-sack last season. He spent the 2022 offseason recovering from shoulder surgery and multiple procedures on his pinky finger, which was partially amputated.The addition of Davenport has put the status of edge rusher Za'Darius Smith further in doubt. Smith had 10 sacks and made the Pro Bowl in his Vikings debut in 2022, but he's carrying a salary cap hit of more than $15.9 million.Oliver was the highest-ranked tight end in run blocking in 2022 by Pro Football Focus. The Vikings ranked 26th in the NFL last season with an average of 4.1 yards per rush and tied for 27th in total rushing yards.Oliver was a third-round draft pick by Jacksonville out of San Jose State in 2019, but he played in only four games in two seasons for the Jaguars. He suffered a severe hamstring injury in his first training camp and, after a brief return, saw his rookie season end with a back injury.The following year, he broke a bone in his foot in camp and was again placed on season-ending injured reserve. The Jaguars traded him the next spring to the Ravens, for whom he had a limited role in 14 games in 2021.Oliver flourished as a run blocker last season, playing in all 17 games and 47% of the snaps on offense. He had 14 receptions for 149 yards and two touchdowns.The move was the first made by Minnesota after the market opened for formal free agent negotiations. The Vikings still needed to clear more than $7 million in salary cap charges when Monday began, even after releasing linebacker Eric Kendricks and wide receiver Adam Thielen last week. Talks can take place over the first two days and agreements in principle can be reached, but contracts cannot be signed until Wednesday.The deal with Oliver all but assures the Vikings will not re-sign tight end Irv Smith Jr., whose injury-limited four years with Minnesota ended with him in a complementary role to Pro Bowl acquisition T.J. Hockenson. Hockenson was sixth overall in the Pro Football Focus tight end rankings for 2022, and Oliver was eighth. The Vikings also have Johnny Mundt under contract at tight end. He primarily is a run blocker as well.___AP Pro Football Writer Rob Maaddi contributed to this report.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/3/14,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834373,Silicon Valley Bank's demise disrupts the disruptors in tech,"Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse rattled the technology industry that had been the bank's backbone, leaving shell-shocked entrepreneurs thankful for the government reprieve that saved their money while they mourned the loss of a place that served as a chummy club of innovation.“They were the gold standard, it almost seemed weird if you were in tech and didn’t have a Silicon Valley Bank account,” Stefan Kalb, CEO of Seattle startup Shelf Engine, said during a Monday interview as he started the process of transferring millions of dollars to other banks.The Biden administration's move guaranteeing all Silicon Valley Bank’s deposits above the insured limit of $250,000 per account resulted in a “palpable sigh of relief” in Israel, where its booming tech sector is “connected with an umbilical cord to Silicon Valley,” said Jon Medved, founder of the Israeli venture capital crowdfunding platform OurCrowd.But the gratitude for the deposit guarantees that will allow thousands of tech startups to continue to pay their workers and other bills was mixed with moments of reflection among entrepreneurs and venture capital partners rattled by Silicon Valley Bank’s downfall.The crisis “has forced every company to reassess their banking arrangements and the companies that they work with,” said Rajeeb Dey, CEO of London-based startup Learnerbly, a platform for workplace learning.Entrepreneurs who had deposited all their startups' money in Silicon Valley Bank are now realizing it makes more sense to spread their funds across several institutions, with the biggest banks considered safer harbors.Kalb started off Monday by opening an account at the largest bank in the U.S., JP Morgan Chase, which has about $2.4 trillion in deposits. That’s 13 times more than the deposits at Silicon Valley Bank, the 16th largest in the U.S.Bank of America is getting some of the money that Electric Era had deposited at Silicon Valley Bank, and the Seattle startup's CEO, Quincy Lee, expects having no difficulty finding other candidates to keep the rest of his company's money as part of its diversification plan.“Any bank is happy to take a startup’s money,” Lee said.Even so, there are fears it will be more difficult to finance the inherently risky ideas underlying tech startups that became a specialty of Silicon Valley Bank since its founding over a poker game in 1983, just as the advent of the personal computer and faster microprocessors unleashed more innovation.Silicon Valley quickly established itself as the “go-to” spot for venture capitalists looking for financial partners more open to unconventional business proposals than its bigger, more established peers who still didn’t have a good grasp of technology.“They understood startups, they understood venture capital,” said Leah Ellis, CEO and co-founder of Sublime Systems, a company in Somerville, Massachusetts, commercializing a process to make low-carbon cement. “They were woven into the fabric of the startup community that I’m part of, so banking with SVB was a no brainer.”Venture capitalists set up their accounts at Silicon Valley Bank just as the tech industry started its boom and then advised the entrepreneurs that they funded to do the same.That cozy relationship came to an end when the bank disclosed a $1.8 billion loss on low-yielding bonds that were purchased before interest rates began to spike last year, raising alarms among its financially savvy customer base who used the fruits of technology to spread warnings that turned into a calamitous run on deposits.Bob Ackerman, founder and managing director of venture funder AllegisCyber Capital, likened last week's flood of withdrawal demands from Silicon Valley Bank to a self-inflicted wound by “a circular firing squad” intent on “shooting your best friend.""Many of Silicon Valley Bank's roughly 8,500 employees now find themselves hanging in limbo, too, even though government regulators now overseeing the operations have told them they will be offered jobs at 1.5 times their salaries for 45 days, said Rob McMillan, who had worked there for 32 years.“We don’t know who’s going to pay us when,” McMillan said. “I think we all missed a paycheck. We don’t know if we have benefits.""Even though all of Silicon Valley Bank's depositors are being made whole, its demise is expected to leave a void in the technology sector that may be difficult to fill. In an essay that he posted on his LinkedIn page, prominent venture capitalist Michael Moritz compared Silicon Valley Bank to a “cherished local market where people behind the counters know the names of their customers, have a ready smile but still charge the going price when they sell a cut of meat.""Silicon Valley Bank is fading away at a time when startups were already having a tougher go at raising money, with a downturn in technology stock values and a steady rise in interest rates causing venture capitalists to retrench. The bank often helped fill the financial gaps with one of its specialties — loans known as “venture debt” because it was woven into the funding provided by its venture capitalist customers.“There’s going to be a lot of great ideas, a lot of great teams that don’t get funding because the barriers to entry are too high or because there are not enough people who are willing to invest,” said William Lin, an investor in the cybersecurity startup Symmetry Systems and a venture partner at ForgePoint, a venture capital firm.With Silicon Valley Bank gone and venture capitalists pulling in their reins, Lin expects there will be fewer startups getting money to pursue ideas in the same fields of technology. If that happens, he foresees a winnowing of competition that will eventually make the biggest tech companies even stronger than they already are.“There’s a real day of reckoning coming in the startup world,"" predicted Amit Yoran, CEO of the cybersecurity firm Tenable.That may be true, but entrepreneurs like Lee and Kalb already feel like they had been through an emotional wringer after spending the weekend worrying that all their hard work would go down a drain if they couldn't get their money out of Silicon Valley Bank.""It was like being stuck inside a doomsday loop,"" Lee said.Even as he focuses on growing Shelf Engine's business of helping grocers managing their food orders, he vowed not to forget “a very hard lesson.”“I obviously now know banks aren't as safe as I used to think they were,” he said.___Associated Press writers Ilan Ben Zion in Jerusalem; Ami Bentov in Tel Aviv; Kelvin Chan in London; Jennifer McDermott in Providence, Rhode Island; Frank Bajak in Boston and Cathy Bussewitz and Cora Lewis in New York contributed to this story.___This story has been updated to correct William Lin's title.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834374,AP PHOTOS: Hong Kong's 'villain hitting' ritual draws crowds,"HONG KONG (AP) — People holding a grudge may have found a way to release it in Hong Kong’s “villain hitting” ritual.To relieve themselves from a bad mood, customers paid ritual practitioners who work underneath the Canal Road Flyover in Causeway Bay, one of the city's shopping districts, and watched them bashing an image of their target with a shoe. It could be anyone — rival lovers and unfriendly colleagues, or horrible bosses and unlikeable public figures.The ritual is particularly popular in March because some people believe that the best day to perform it falls on “ging zat,” as pronounced in Cantonese, a day on the Chinese lunar calendar that literally means “awakening of insects.""This year, “ging zat” fell on March 6. The tradition, mostly run by elderly women, attracted crowds of customers after the lifting of major COVID-19 restrictions, including the mask mandate.“I’m hoping to cut out all the gossip around me and wish that the bad people would stay away from me,” said tourist Edison Chan, who traveled from neighboring Guangdong province.Ho Pan-yong, one of the practitioners, said she wanted to help her customers whack the bad people away from their lives. She charged 50 Hong Kong dollars ($6.40) for the five-minute act, which includes lighting incense offering to gods followed by whacking the target and concludes by ritual blessing.The ritual, which does not hurt anyone physically, could help bring hopes to those who are distressed, said Dr. Beatrice Ng-Kessler, a registered clinical psychologist in Hong Kong and in the U.K.",2023/3/14,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834381,Photo of the Day: Magical mini mushroom spotted in Taipei,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Photos of a tiny, otherworldly mushroom collected in Taipei have gone viral.On Nov. 17, 2022, 32-year-old Eric Cho (卓霆宇), who works as a pharmacist, spotted this species of mushroom near 150, Section 3, Zhishan Road, in Taipei City's Shilin District. The mysterious mushroom is believed to be Mycena subcyanocephala (近藍蓋小菇).When asked how he found the fungi, Cho said his friend Chiang Pei-ying (蔣珮瑩) informed him that Bixi Trail in Shilin District has a ""special tiny mushroom"" worth investigating. Cho said that he found one on a piece of wood and took it home.However, he was disappointed to find that it was a rather drab grayish-white color. Hoping that it might glow, he then tried turning off all the lights at night, but to no avail.Cho said that he dutifully sprayed the fungi every day to keep it moist. After more than three months, Cho noticed that on March 7, a new spawn had appeared on the wood with a spectacular blue color.He said that according to a research paper titled, ""Two new species of Mycena in Taiwan,"" the blue color only appears in the young stage and fades to light-blue or whitish when it reaches maturation.On March 12, Cho submitted photos of the fungus to iNaturalist and on March 13, the website posted the images on its Twitter account. As of publication, the post has garnered 8,422 likes, 2,219 retweets, and 307 quote retweets.Mushroom Eric Cho spotted in the wild. (Eric Cho photo)Mushroom spawn that appeared after three months.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834416,"Lula meets with Indigenous in Brazil's Amazon, pledges lands","RAPOSA SERRA DO SOL INDIGENOUS TERRITORY, Brazil (AP) — On his first trip to Indigenous land in the Amazon rainforest since taking office, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva expressed support for creating new territories for those communities, but stopped short of announcing any demarcations.Wearing white cap and dark shirt in the heat, Lula addressed some 2,000 Indigenous people who painted their faces, wore traditional feather headdresses and sang songs to welcome him Monday to the Raposa Serra do Sol region bordering Venezuela and Guyana.He said he wants quick demarcation of their lands “before other people take over, invent false documents” to claim ownership rights. That has been a common occurence throughout Brazil's history, which prompted the start of demarcation processes over a half century ago.“We need to quickly try to legalize every land whose (demarcation) studies are almost finished so the Indigenous can take the land that is theirs,” Lula said at the 52nd general assembly of the Indigenous peoples of the State of Roraima.Yet Lula stopped short of actually announcing any new designations that are much anticipated by Indigenous people and rights activists. Many already had their hopes dashed that new demarcations would take place in the first 30 days of his administration, which began Jan. 1.Their movement has pressured Lula to demarcate 13 new Indigenous territories that have cleared all regulatory steps and require nothing more than presidential approval to be official. Doing so would mark a sharp change in policy from the previous administration of Jair Bolsonaro, who did not demarcate any land for them during his presidency.Some of the territories pending a presidential authorization began their demarcation processes decades ago.Lula authorized the demarcation of Raposa Serra do Sol in 2005, during his first term as president. Different from other reserves in the Brazilian Amazon, Raposa Serra do Sol is mostly tropical savannah. It is home to 26,000 people from five different ethnicities.Since receiving its protected status, it has been a scene of conflict between rice farmers and Indigenous people and has had sporadic violence, making the territory something of a case study in the challenges of protecting land that is increasingly under pressure from without.Bolsonaro's relentless push to legalize mining on Indigenous territories rekindled long-standing divisions among Raposa Serra do Sol's local communities about the best path forward for their collective well-being. He visited an illegal gold mining camp in the same Indigenous territory in October 2021 and openly encouraged the activity, despite criticism from local Indigenous leaders.Preparations for Lula’s arrival at Raposa Serra do Sol began shortly before dayreak in the Amazon, with Indigenous people of different groups waking early to gather at a community center for their final rehearsal of songs and dances for the president. People of different ages wearing straw skirts lurched backward and forward as drums and chants resounded. Other Indigenous people were back at their tents preparing breakfast for the members of their groups.Indigenous leaders, including Osmar Lima Batista of the Macuxi people, Letícia Monteiro da Silva of the Taurepang people, and Adailton Waiwai of the Waiwai people, told The Associated Press at the meeting that they expect better days compared with the prior four years, when they believed they did not have a friend in the presidential palace.All agreed that Lula's first visit to the region since 2010 was not enough, however.Davi Kopenawa, leader of the Yanomami people, took the microphone during the gathering to tell Lula that his people's needs are greater than those of four years ago.“After we take the gold miners out, we need to recover our Indigenous health care system, which was destroyed,” Kopenawa said. “We need to save the children we have left. I don't want more children dying. We need hospitals in our community. Disease is still strong in the Amazon.”“I don't want mining on Yanomami lands and in the Raposa Serra do Sol territory,” he added. “Mining kills us, it kills people in the city, the river, the water of the forest. We don't need heavy mining at our home.”Lula said in his speech that his administration will definitively expel gold miners from Indigenous lands — as it has already begun working to do in the Yanomami territory.""That gold doesn’t belong to anyone. It’s there because nature placed it there. It’s on Indigenous land,” Lula said.The president was accompanied by Sonia Guajajara, his minister of Indigenous peoples, and Joenia Wapichana, who heads the Indigenous affairs agency.Lula said there will be a meeting involving leaders of countries of the Amazon rainforest — Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela.___Savarese reported from Sao Paulo.",2023/3/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834417,Grizzlies stay mum on return of Morant beyond next game,"DALLAS (AP) — The Memphis Grizzlies aren't saying when star point guard Ja Morant will return with one game remaining in a four-game sabbatical the team said he needed to deal with personal issues.Morant was away from the team for a fifth consecutive game on Monday night, a 104-88 victory over Dallas that gave the Grizzlies a sweep of a home-and-home set with the Mavericks.Citing unidentified sources, ESPN reported during the game that Morant has entered a counseling program in Florida. Coach Taylor Jenkins declined to comment on that report.“Outside of what I’ve said in the past, respectful to the nature of the situation and stuff, I think I said on the outset he was taking time and responsibility to get better himself so he could be better for our team,” Jenkins said. “I’m not going to really comment further until there’s more updates necessary.”Morant is away from the team after posting a video recently in which the 23-year-old two-time All-Star appeared to be displaying a gun at a Denver-area strip club.The sixth game of Morant's absence will be Wednesday night at Miami, but Jenkins said the club isn't ready to indicate what will happen after that.“There are a lot of internal dialogues going on,” Jenkins said before the game. “There are still things going on at the league level that we’re in communication with. Ja’s fully engaged in this process and whatever comes next after these two games.”The Grizzlies are in a tight race for the No. 2 seed in the Western Conference with Sacramento, with those teams about three games clear of a tightly packed group trying to stay in the top six and avoid the West play-in tournament.“We're focused on winning basketball games,” said guard Desmond Bane, who led the Grizzlies with 23 points in Monday's victory over Dallas. “Obviously, Ja's getting help. Whenever he's ready to return to the team, we're going to welcome him with open arms.”Memphis won its third consecutive game without Morant after losing the first two he missed. The Grizzlies were 20-5 without him last year, when they finished second in the West.“I think it’s a lot of factors,” Jenkins said of the success without Morant last season. “It’s not about doing more. It’s just about, in your opportunity, play better, just seek the opportunities.”___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/14,,World

(AP) — Giannis Antetokounmpo had 46 points and 12 rebounds as the Milwaukee Bucks beat the Sacramento Kings 133-124 on Monday night.Khris Middleton scored 31 points and Brook Lopez added 23 for the Bucks, who are on the verge of becoming the first team to clinch a playoff berth this season. They came in needing a win and a Miami loss, but the Heat beat Utah.“It was a really fun environment to play in,” Lopez said. ""Sacramento always has great fans, great team this year. You get the cowbells and everything like that and all stuff I remember. It was a really fun atmosphere.”Domantas Sabonis had 23 points, 17 rebounds and 15 assists for his 10th triple-double of the season for Sacramento. Sabonis has a franchise-record 54 double-doubles, which leads the NBA.“Their team is very good for us to take our foot off the accelerator,” Sabonis said. ""That’s what we did in the second half, unacceptable.”De'Aaron Fox scored 35 points to lead the Kings, and Kevin Huerter had 17 of his 28 in the fourth quarter.The Bucks scored six straight points on a 3-pointer by Brook Lopez and three free throws by Middleton to take a 106-100 lead with under eight minutes remaining in the fourth quarter. Sacramento scored the next eight points and took a two-point lead on Huerter's 3 midway through the quarter.Antetokounmpo made two free throws to cap a 7-0 run that put Milwaukee up 113-108 with five minutes to go, and the Kings got no closer than two points the rest of the way. Another 7-0 burst push the lead to 127-116 with two minutes left.“It’s unfortunate,” Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. “I think it was a great game. I was so impressed by Sacramento and they way they play. I’m not going to say anything about what did or didn’t happen.”FIGHTWith 15.4 seconds left, Sacramento's Trey Lyles and Lopez got into an altercation, which led to the ejection of both players.“I don’t know what happened, but we ain’t taking (nothing) from nobody,"" Kings coach Mike Brown said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834425,Activists urge UN Security Council to refer Myanmar to court,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Human rights activists urged the U.N. Security Council on Monday to refer Myanmar's military rulers to the International Criminal Court and urged neighboring Southeast Asian countries to support the opposition pro-democracy movement.The leaders of two women’s rights organizations spoke to reporters ahead of a closed council meeting on Myanmar. Members heard briefings by U.N. special envoy for Myanmar Noeleen Heyzer and Indonesia’s Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi, whose country chairs the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations.May Sabe Phyu, director of the Gender Equality Network, a coalition of organizations promoting women’s rights in Myanmar, accused Myanmar’s military of conducting “a terror campaign"" and committing “heinous acts” that constituted crimes against humanity. She said the Security Council should refer the junta’s actions to the International Criminal Court for prosecution.Myanmar’s military has long been accused of human rights violations, most notably during a brutal 2017 counterinsurgency campaign against Rohingya Muslims in the western state of Rakhine. International courts are considering whether that crackdown was genocide.In 2021, the military ousted Myanmar’s elected civilian government, then moved to violently suppress public opposition to the takeover. Some experts now consider the situation in Myanmar to be a civil war in which the army has conducting major offensives against widespread armed resistance.ASEAN adopted a five-step consensus on restoring peace in April 2021 to which Myanmar agreed but has not implemented, leading to Myanmar's exclusion from some top-level ASEAN meetings since then.The Security Council approved its first-ever resolution on Myanmar in December, demanding an immediate end to violence, urging its military rulers to release all “arbitrarily detained” prisoners including ousted leader Aung San Suu Kyi and to restore democratic institutions. It also reiterated a call for dialogue and reconciliation and urged all sides “to respect human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law.”The activists called for an arms embargo, for the U.N. special envoy to have public engagements with pro-democracy actors, and for accountability for crimes perpetrated by the military.Phyu, who left Myanmar after the takeover and is now based in the United States, asked the Security Council to pressure Myanmar’s neighbors not to support the government but to publicly support democratic forces, including the National Unity Government, which she said has the support of the people of Myanmar.And she criticized U.N. envoy Heyzer for meeting Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing but not meeting publicly with pro-democracy groups including the National Unity Government, which operates underground and calls itself the country’s legitimate government.Naw Hser Hser, head of the Women’s League of Burma, said supporters of democracy feel forgotten by the international community.Before Monday’s council meeting, Britain’s U.N. Ambassador Barbara Woodward said the Security Council fully supports ASEAN and the five-point council, but stressed that it’s time for progress now.“The people of Myanmar have been suffering for too long,"" Woodward said. ""Myanmar is the second deadliest place in the world for civilians and the people of Myanmar really can’t wait.”France’s deputy U.N. ambassador Nathalie Broadhurst told The Associated Press after the council meeting that Marsudi presented the implementation plan which calls for action on all five points in parallel, not sequentially.“They say they don’t want megaphone diplomacy,” Broadhurst added, expressing hope that the ASEAN effort will eventually lead to a national inclusive effort and end the “desperate situation” in Myanmar.Brazil’s U.N. Ambassador Ronaldo Costa Filho told AP that council members supported ASEAN, and some said the Security Council should be prepared for further action, but no new council action is expected “for the time being.”The Security Council in New York has been increasingly divided due to a major rift among its five permanent members: China and Russia on one side, Britain, France and the United States on the other.",2023/3/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834426,Warriors beat Suns 123-112 for 8th straight home victory,"SAN FRANCSICO (AP) — The Golden State Warriors were tired of losing to the division-rival Suns this season and set their mind on defending against Phoenix just as they did against the talented Bucks last game.Klay Thompson scored 33 of his 38 points in the first half, Stephen Curry added 23 points, seven rebounds and five assists, and the Warriors beat the Suns 123-112 on Monday night.“There's always a little bit of extra motivation when you got smacked a couple times against a certain team but it's more so about our own focus,” Curry said.Thompson made eight 3-pointers and shot 14 of 23 overall.“We knew how big a game it was and Klay knew how big it was and came out and set the tone,” coach Steve Kerr said.Jordan Poole had 20 points and six assists off the bench for the defending champions. Kevon Looney helped the Warriors win their eighth straight home game and 12th of 13 with nine points, 10 rebounds and five assists. Golden State is 29-7 at home but 7-26 on the road.Devin Booker scored 32 points and Deandre Ayton had 27 points and 12 rebounds for the Suns, who roared back after halftime to make it interesting.Josh Okogie's 3 with 4:59 left in the third pulled Phoenix within 85-81 and his putback a minute later made it 87-84 before Curry and Co. came on again.Things got heated in the closing minutes when JaMychal Green and ex-Warriors guard Damion Lee received a double technical with 1:12 left. Curry's mom, Sonya, hopped out of her seat and became emotional yelling and making sure son-in-law Lee was OK.“That was like old-school AAU back in the day where parents get involved,” Curry said. “Family over everything at times.”Kevin Durant again missed facing his former team with fans present in San Francisco, sitting out a third straight game for the Suns because of a sprained left ankle. Golden State's Chase Center crowd has still not been able to acknowledge the star who led the Warriors to a pair of titles and captured NBA Finals MVP honors in 2017 and '18.Durant played for Brooklyn at Chase Center in February 2021 during the pandemic period when no spectators were allowed.“It's nuts. It's insane,” Kerr said of Durant not yet being greeted by the San Francisco crowd.Chris Paul contributed 11 points and 11 assists for Phoenix, coming off a 128-119 loss to division-leading Sacramento at home Saturday that snapped a four-game winning streak.The Suns won the previous four meetings with Golden State, including three straight in the season series, missing a chance to sweep all four matchups for the first time since 2010-11.“Every game now is critical,” Kerr said.Draymond Green played 30 minutes and delivered a timely two-handed slam early in the fourth after rolling his right ankle during Saturday's overtime win against the Bucks. He had three blocks and a pair of steals to go with six rebounds, four points and four assists.Golden State went ahead 43-21 after shooting 72.7% in the first quarter with Thompson and Curry shooting a combined 7 of 9 on 3s.Phoenix fell behind in a hurry to the hot-shooting Warriors, who raced ahead 29-12 before a Suns timeout with 3:21 left in the first. JaMychal Green scored seven points in the period.“Their shot-making in the first quarter in general put us in the hole,” Suns coach Monty Williams said. “There were a few breakdowns because of their pace but I didn't think it was a failing grade.”TIP-INSSuns: Ayton has consecutive double-doubles. ... Other than Booker beginning 3 of 5, the rest of the Suns shot 5 for 16 in the cold opening period. The Warriors scored eight points off six Phoenix turnovers. ... The Suns lost for the first time in five road games vs. the Pacific Division.Warriors: G Gary Payton II, acquired from Portland at last month's trade deadline but yet to play in his return to the Warriors, was re-evaluated and shown to be making progress from a right thigh injury stemming from offseason core muscle surgery. He has begun on-court work and will continue to do more in the coming days with another evaluation set for 10 days. “There’s definitely hope and optimism that he’ll be able to play at some point,” Kerr said. ... F Andrew Wiggins missed his 12th straight game dealing with a family matter. ... F Jonathan Kuminga was out a third straight game with a sprained right ankle. ... G Lester Quinones' 10-day contract expired Sunday but Kerr expects a decision on his status soon.UP NEXTSuns: Host the Bucks on Tuesday night to complete.Warriors: Open a five-game trip at the Clippers on Wednesday night, trying to end an eight-game road skid.___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834427,Robertson's 39th goal helps Stars roll Kraken 5-2,"SEATTLE (AP) — Two games in three days against the same opponent in the same town gave the Dallas Stars a little taste of what could be coming in the playoffs.The Stars look more than ready for the postseason to arrive, especially after an impressive sweep in Seattle that kept Dallas on top in the Central Division.Jason Robertson scored his 39th goal of the season, the last of three power-play goals by Dallas, and the Stars beat the Seattle Kraken 5-2 on Monday night for their sixth win in seven games.Robertson’s goal came in the opening seconds of the third period and gave Dallas a three-goal lead. Jamie Benn had a goal and two assists and Miro Heisknaen had three assists as Dallas strengthened its lead on top of the division.“I think our execution, our passes were pretty crispy,” Robertson said of the Stars' power play. “Our movement, trying to be unpredictable, they’re guys moving all around the place.”The Stars swept the two games in three days against the Kraken and moved three points in front of Minnesota with 15 games left in the regular season.“It was an important four points. You look at the standings and we’re in a fight for first in the division, first in the conference. They’re in a battle for playoff positioning. They’ve been playing great all year,” Dallas coach Peter DeBoer said. “So this was a real test for us coming in here for two games and I thought our group really responded.”Evgenii Dadonov, Joe Pavelski and Wyatt Johnston also scored for Dallas. Jake Oettinger made 26 saves for Dallas.Yanni Gourde and Eeli Tolvanen scored for Seattle, but the problem for the Kraken was their penalty kill. Seattle entered the game having killed 31 of the previous 32 power-play opportunities by its opponents, only to watch the Stars go 3 for 4 with the man advantage.“Bottom line, we didn't get job done. At the end of the day that’s what matters,” Seattle coach Dave Hakstol said. “There’s a couple there that we made mistakes on with where our positioning was, where our sticks are.”Dadonov and Benn scored inside the first six minutes to give Dallas a 2-0 lead, and Pavelski’s power-play goal early in the second period made it 3-1.The turning point came midway through the second period after Tolvanen scored his 14th of the season and 12th since joining the Kraken to pull Seattle to 3-2. Just 14 seconds after the goal, Johnston outworked Daniel Sprong for a loose puck and caught Seattle goaltender Martin Jones out of position for his 17th goal and a 4-2 Dallas lead.“I was lucky enough to get it around the goalie and get it in as I was falling,” Johnston said.Jones made 27 saves and looked uneasy at times making his first start in 11 days.Seattle lost for the fifth time in its past six home games and dropped to 16-14-4 at home on the season. While the Kraken are poised to make the playoffs in their second season, their struggles at home may end up being the deciding factor in whether Seattle enters the postseason as one of the top three in the Pacific Division or a wild card.“We’ve been a group that’s been able to turn the page and go back to the next job at hand,” Hakstol said. “This group has to be able to do that again.”NOTES: Dallas F Tyler Seguin missed his second straight game after suffering a cut on his left leg last week against Buffalo. Seguin is expected to be out for a couple of weeks. ... Seattle's Vince Dunn had two assists and extended his point streak to 10 games, the longest active streak in the league.UP NEXTStars: At Vancouver on Tuesday night.Kraken: At San Jose on Thursday night.___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/14,,World

After more than two years of pandemic, global economy began to recover, entering 2022, the Russian Federations invasion of Ukraine and its global effects on commodity markets, supply chains, inflation, and financial conditions have steepened the slowdown in global growth. In particular, the war in Ukraine is leading to soaring prices and volatility in energy markets, with improvements in activity in energy exporters more than offset by headwinds to activity in most other economies. The invasion of Ukraine has also led to a significant increase in agricultural commodity prices, which is exacerbating food insecurity and extreme poverty in many emerging market and developing economies.Numerous risks could further derail what is now a precarious recovery. Among them is, in particular, the possibility of stubbornly high global inflation accompanied by tepid growth, reminiscent of the stagflation of the 1970s. This could eventually result in a sharp tightening of monetary policy in advanced economies to rein in inflation, lead to surging borrowing costs, and possibly culminate in financial stress in some emerging market and developing economies.

After more than two years of pandemic, global economy began to recover, entering 2022, the Russian Federations invasion of Ukraine and its global effects on commodity markets, supply chains, inflation, and financial conditions have steepened the slowdown in global growth. In particular, the war in Ukraine is leading to soaring prices and volatility in energy markets, with improvements in activity in energy exporters more than offset by headwinds to activity in most other economies. The invasion of Ukraine has also led to a significant increase in agricultural commodity prices, which is exacerbating food insecurity and extreme poverty in many emerging market and developing economies.Numerous risks could further derail what is now a precarious recovery. Among them is, in particular, the possibility of stubbornly high global inflation accompanied by tepid growth, reminiscent of the stagflation of the 1970s.

After more than two years of pandemic, global economy began to recover, entering 2022, the Russian Federations invasion of Ukraine and its global effects on commodity markets, supply chains, inflation, and financial conditions have steepened the slowdown in global growth. In particular, the war in Ukraine is leading to soaring prices and volatility in energy markets, with improvements in activity in energy exporters more than offset by headwinds to activity in most other economies. The invasion of Ukraine has also led to a significant increase in agricultural commodity prices, which is exacerbating food insecurity and extreme poverty in many emerging market and developing economies.Numerous risks could further derail what is now a precarious recovery. Among them is, in particular, the possibility of stubbornly high global inflation accompanied by tepid growth, reminiscent of the stagflation of the 1970s. This could eventually result in a sharp tightening of monetary policy in advanced economies to rein in inflation, lead to surging borrowing costs, and possibly culminate in financial stress in some emerging market and developing economies. A forceful and wide-ranging policy response is required by policy makers in these economies and the global community to boost growth, bolster macroeconomic frameworks, reduce financial vulnerabilities, provide support to vulnerable population groups, and attenuate the long-term impacts of the global shocks of recent years.In this complex international situation, Report Ocean published Vaccine Shipping Box Market Status, Trends and COVID-19 Impact Report 2022, which provides a comprehensive analysis of the global market , This Report covers the manufacturer data, including: sales volume, price, revenue, gross margin, business distribution etc., these data help the consumer know about the competitors better.

Commercial greenhouses are available in several sizes and shapes with various functions. The commercial greenhouses typically deliver a controlled environment for plant production with abundant sunlight, humidity, and temperature. Also, they need exposure to light, particularly in the morning hours. Water, fuel, and electricity make environment controls possible that are essential for favorable results. Thus, greenhouse technology is a major technology of all agricultural production activities. The consumption of a commercial greenhouse is mainly expanding for the production of seasonal and non-seasonal crops, for producing high-quality fruits, vegetables and flowers, and the formulation of nursey prepared by the tissue culture. Therefore, the rising need for a commercial greenhouse for the production of high-quality crops, along with the limited availability of arable land in developed & developing countries are the few factors responsible for the CAGR of the market during the forecast period.According to the survey conducted by World Bank Group, it is estimated that Japan having 11.74% availability of arable land in 2010 but it has reduced to 11.47% by the end of the year 2016.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834513,Why Taiwan’s Pro-Crypto Stance Makes Trading Cryptocurrency in 2023 a Smart Move,"The global bitcoin market has gained more notoriety in recent years.While many nations accept cryptocurrencies to different degrees, Taiwan has emerged as a crypto-friendly country with a thriving market. This essay will explore Taiwan’s advantages and discuss why trading cryptocurrencies there in 2023 is still a wise choice.
Taiwan’s Pro-Crypto Stance
One of the main reasons why trading cryptocurrency in Taiwan is a smart move is the country’s pro-crypto stance. Unlike other countries that have been hesitant to embrace cryptocurrencies, Taiwan has taken a proactive approach in regulating the industry. In 2018, the country passed a bill that classified cryptocurrencies as virtual assets, giving them legal status.
Moreover, Taiwan has also been actively promoting the development of blockchain technology, which underpins cryptocurrencies. In 2020, the government launched a five-year plan to invest NT$ 4.5 billion (US$160 million) in the development of the blockchain industry. This initiative includes the establishment of a blockchain-based electronic voting system and the development of a blockchain-based platform for digital identification.
Growing Cryptocurrency Market in Taiwan
Another reason why trading cryptocurrency in Taiwan is still a smart move is the growing market. In recent years, the country’s crypto market has been steadily increasing in size and volume. According to a report by Chainalysis, Taiwan’s cryptocurrency adoption has grown by 97% in the last year.
Furthermore, Taiwan has become a hub for cryptocurrency mining, which has contributed to the growth of the industry. The country has abundant sources of renewable energy, making it an attractive location for mining operations. Taiwan also has a well-established technology industry, which provides a strong foundation for the development of blockchain technology.
In addition to the growing market, Taiwan also has a vibrant cryptocurrency community. The country has several active cryptocurrency exchanges, such as BitoPro and Maicoin, which provide a range of services to investors. Moreover, there are several blockchain-based startups in Taiwan that are developing innovative solutions for various industries.
Taiwanese traders interested in more aggressive investments also have the freedom to trade advanced trading instruments such as crypto binary options trading. This is a great opportunity for Taiwanese investors looking to aggressively grow their investment portfolios. But note that, this type of trading instrument is only recommended for experienced traders who regularly monitor current cryptocurrency news and market volatility.
Supportive Government Policies
Apart from its pro-crypto stance, Taiwan’s government has also implemented several policies to support the growth of the cryptocurrency industry. In 2020, the country’s National Development Council announced a plan to establish a blockchain alliance, which aims to bring together various government agencies and private enterprises to collaborate on blockchain-related initiatives.
Furthermore, the government has also provided tax incentives for cryptocurrency-related businesses. In 2018, the National Taxation Bureau announced that profits from cryptocurrency transactions would be subject to a flat tax rate of 15%, which is significantly lower than the regular tax rate for businesses.
Future Outlook for Cryptocurrency in Taiwan
Looking ahead, the future outlook for cryptocurrency in Taiwan looks promising. The government of the nation has made it obvious that it wants to lead the blockchain industry and is actively funding its growth. Moreover, Taiwan’s technology industry provides a strong foundation for the growth of the industry.
Furthermore, as the global adoption of cryptocurrencies continues to increase, Taiwan is likely to benefit from this trend.

The targets could be high-value individuals or vehicles, including ships close to the shore, according to the report.The military-run NCSIST showed 10 drones at Tuesday’s event, including the Albatross I already in production, and prototypes of the Albatross II and the Cardinal III still under development.Like the U.S. Switchblade, the latest Taiwan-made unmanned aerial vehicle has wings that flip out once the projectile has left its launch tube.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834531,Alaska oil project approval adds yet another climate concern,"JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) — The Biden administration’s approval of a massive oil development in northern Alaska commits the U.S. to yet another decadeslong crude project even as scientists urgently warn that only a halt to more fossil fuel emissions can stem climate change.ConocoPhillips’ Willow project would produce 180,000 barrels of oil a day at its peak, and using that crude would result in at least 263 million tons (239 million metric tons) of greenhouse gas emissions over 30 years.Demand for oil isn't dropping as the planet heats, and a bitter political dispute over the project, which was approved Monday, has underscored the Democratic administration’s struggle to balance economic pressures against pledges to curb fossil fuels. The proposal in the remote region north of the Arctic Circle also highlights the paradox facing the U.S. and other nations: The world’s transition to clean energy lags behind the reality of an economy still largely driven by oil consumption.“At some point, we have to leave oil and gas and coal in the ground. And for me, that some point is now — particularly in a vulnerable ecosystem like the Arctic,” said Rob Jackson, a climate scientist at Stanford University.Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, in announcing Willow's approval, stressed that the number of drill pads was reduced by 40% from ConocoPhillips' original proposal, which she said would benefit people and wildlife. But the company still is expected to get most of the oil it wanted, resulting in only an 8% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, according to government estimates.For Alaska, the project promises an economic boost after oil production dropped sharply since the late 1980s. Leaders from both parties in the state united behind it. Oil has long been the state's economic lifeblood, with revenues helping remote communities and villages on Alaska’s petroleum-rich North Slope.But the state also has felt the impacts of climate change: coastal erosion is threatening Indigenous villages, unusual wildfires are popping up, sea ice is thinning and permafrost promises to release carbon as it melts.Attorneys representing environmentalists and an Alaska Native group filed a lawsuit Tuesday asking a federal judge to block Willow's approval. The Sovereign Iñupiat for a Living Arctic, Sierra Club and other groups said Interior officials ignored the fact that every ton of greenhouse gasses emitted by the project would contribute to sea ice melt, which endangers polar bears and Alaskan villages.The International Energy Agency has said new drilling investments must be halted if nations, including the U.S., hope to reach their 2050 goal of net-zero emissions, meaning only as much planet-warming gas is released into the atmosphere as can be absorbed.The energy sector accounts for 90% of carbon dioxide emissions worldwide and three-quarters of the total human-made greenhouse gases.Yet global demand for crude is expected to continue rising, according to industry analysts and the U.S. Energy Information Administration.Instead of targeting domestic supplies of those fuels — including projects like Willow — energy expert Jim Krane said policymakers should focus on reducing demand.“If you target supply in the U.S. without any kind of measures to bring demand down, refiners are just going to pull their oil from overseas,” said Krane, of Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy.Electric vehicles offer a potential substitute for gasoline-powered cars and trucks, but so far they've barely dented fossil fuel demand. By 2030, EV is expected to displace 2.7 million barrels of oil a day, according to Enverus Intelligence Research, a data analysis firm focused on the energy industry.That’s less than 3% of global oil consumption, which in 2030 is anticipated to be about the same as current levels — roughly 100 million barrels a day, said Al Salazar, senior vice president of the research company.“Demand does not go to zero in a blink-of-the-eye,"" Salazar said. “It takes time to turn over the entire light duty vehicle fleet.”The Willow project is in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, where Republican U.S. senators have noted drilling should be expected.Greenhouse gases from Willow would equal emissions from about 1.7 million cars, or just over 0.1% of the U.S. total. Interior Department officials for years have cited such relatively small percentages as justification for approvals of coal mines and oil and gas leases.Jackson said that perspective can’t continue if the worst effects of climate change are to be avoided. The planet is “as far from zero emissions as we've ever been” despite the emphasis on renewable energy.“It’s the same as thinking, well, every new car we put on the road or coal plant we build doesn’t matter because there are millions of other cars and thousands of other coal plants around the world operating,” he said.Prior to the Willow decision, the administration already had softened its opposition to oil and gas — a departure from the early days of Biden’s presidency. During negotiations over last year’s climate bill the administration agreed to tens of millions of acres of new leasing to get the support of Democratic holdout U.S. Sen.

Consequently, the administration will offer for sale more than 73 million acres (29.5 million hectares) of oil and gas leases for sale March 29 in the Gulf of Mexico. Over several months beginning in May, it also plans to auction some 350,000 acres (141,600 hectares) of onshore oil and gas leases in Wyoming, New Mexico, Montana, Nevada and other states.Environmentalists say the Gulf sale alone could yield more than 1 billion barrels of oil over 50 years.“This administration has pledged to oversee a historic transition to clean energy, but actions speak louder than words,” said Earthjustice attorney George Torgun, who represents environmental groups trying to stop further lease sales.___Brown reported from Billings, Montana.",2023/3/15,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834533,Australia says nuclear subs needed to counter militarization,"CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — Australia's defense minister said Tuesday a deal to buy nuclear-powered attack submarines from the United States was necessary to counter the biggest conventional military buildup in the region since World War II.Australian officials said the deal will cost up to $245 billion over the next three decades and create 20,000 jobs. It comes at a time that China is rapidly building up its own military.Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles said it had made a huge diplomatic effort for months ahead of Monday's announcement of the deal, including making more than 60 calls to regional and world leaders. Australia had even offered to keep China in the loop, he said.“We offered a briefing. I have not participated in a briefing with China,"" Marles said.Asked by reporters if China had rejected the briefing or responded at all, Marles replied: “I'm not aware of that response.”Without specifically mentioning China, Marles said Australia needed to respond to the military buildup in the Pacific.“A failure to do so would see us be condemned by history,” he said.China has said the deal poses serious nuclear proliferation risks and stimulates the arms race.“We urge the U.S., Britain and Australia to abandon the Cold War mentality and zero-sum game, faithfully fulfill their international obligations and do more to contribute to regional peace and stability,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said during a daily briefing Thursday.Marles said Australia intended to increase its military capabilities and to spend more on defense in the future, something it wanted to be transparent about.“You know, our concern about other military buildups is that they happen in a manner which is opaque, and where neighbors are left uneasy as to why it is occurring,” he said. “That is why we have gone to such an effort to make clear exactly why we are taking the steps that we’re taking.”U.S. President Joe Biden announced the deal in San Diego along with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. Albanese said the agreement “represents the biggest single investment in Australia’s defense capability in all of our history.”Australia is buying three, and possibly up to five, Virginia-class boats as part of deal. Under the so-called AUKUS partnership, a future generation of submarines will be built in Britain and in Australia with U.S. technology and support.Australia estimates the deal will cost it between 268 billion and 368 billion Australian dollars ($178-$245 billion).Biden emphasized the ships would not carry nuclear weapons of any kind. Albanese has said he doesn't think the deal will sour its relationship with China, which he noted had improved in recent months.The secretly brokered AUKUS deal included the Australian government’s cancellation of a $66 billion contract for a French-built fleet of conventional submarines, which sparked a diplomatic row within the Western alliance that took months to mend.Marles on Tuesday appeared eager to move on from that.“In an operational sense, we are building our relationship with France, with a much greater tempo of military exercises, with much greater access to our bases on the Australian continent but also French bases in the Pacific and indeed in the Indian Ocean,” he said.",2023/3/14,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834572,Taiwan media see fight for survival among automakers in China,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Following the COVID pandemic, China’s automobile industry was given priority status as an industrial segment in need of economic revitalization.Few have taken the bait of government subsidy programs for new vehicle purchases, leading automakers with little choice but to slash prices further. Many automakers are now jettisoning profits for the sake of survival, per CNA.For example, a promotional poster for BMW’s new 120iM-Sport released by a distributor in Fujian, offers a promotional price of NT$574,000 (US$18,812). This is a discount of 38.2% over the auto’s suggested sticker price.BMW is one of the last automakers in China to engage in a price war. Volkswagen, Audi, and Mercedes-Benz have already cut prices by as much as NT$305,000 (US$10,000). Honda offered a price cut of only around NT$100,0000 (US$3,000).Chinese media reported that price cuts in the auto market began with Tesla and BYD slashing prices on electric vehicles (EVs). The cuts soon spilled over to traditional fossil fuel vehicles, leading to price cuts at some 30 different car brands.In addition to price cuts, consumers are also being spurred on to buy new autos through subsidy programs backed by car manufacturers, regional dealers, and even local municipalities. Many of the subsidy programs dramatically lower the purchase cost of a new car.For example, Hubei Province, where Dongfeng Motor (DFM) is located, provides a subsidy of up to NT$400,000 (US$13,125) to local consumers who purchase a DFM vehicle. This means a Citroen C6 is available to Chinese people for only NT$518,000 (US$17,000).Henan Province provides a 5% subsidy for new cars made and purchased in the province. And other provincial-level administrative regions such as Zhejiang, Henan, Sichuan, Yunnan, and Hainan have also offered a range of subsidies for new car purchases.",2023/3/14,1218,World

The announcement Tuesday came after it declared a “decisive victory” over COVID-19 in February.All types of visas will resume from Wednesday. Visa-free entry also will resume at destinations such as Hainan island as well as for cruise ships entering Shanghai that had no visa requirement before COVID-19.Foreigners holding visas issued before March 28, 2020, that are still valid will be allowed to enter China. Visa-free entry will resume for foreigners entering Guangdong in southern China from Hong Kong and Macao. The notice didn't specify whether vaccination certificates or negative COVID-19 tests would be required, but Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin told reporters Tuesday that China had “optimized measures for remote testing of people coming to China from relevant countries,"" allowing pre-boarding antigen testing instead of nucleic acid testing.“All these have been well implemented, and the epidemic risk is generally controllable,” Wang said at a daily briefing.The move would “further facilitate the exchange of Chinese and foreign personnel,” according to the notice posted on the websites of numerous Chinese missions and embassies.China had stuck to a harsh “zero-COVID” strategy involving sudden lockdowns and daily COVID-19 testing to try to stop the virus before abandoning most aspects of the policy in December amid growing opposition.The relaxation of visa rules follows China's approval of outbound group tours for Chinese citizens, the results of which have been positive, and the overall improvement in pandemic conditions, Wang said.“China will continue to make better arrangements for the safe, healthy and orderly movement of Chinese and foreign personnel on the basis of scientific assessments and in light of the situation,"" he said. “We also hope that all parties will join China in creating favorable conditions for cross-border exchanges.""",2023/3/14,,World

Oil prices regained some of the previous day's sharp losses.Wall Street's benchmark S&P 500 index rose Tuesday as bank stocks recovered some of their losses caused by worries customers might pull out deposits following the collapse of two U.S. lenders.Stocks rose despite inflation data showing prices rose 6% over a year earlier in February, down from the previous month's 6.4% but still far above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. Investors had worried the Federal Reserve might respond to enduring upward pressure on prices by speeding up the pace of interest rate increases.“The anchoring of less hawkish expectations provided some catalyst for risk sentiments to recover,” Yeap Jun Rong of IG said in a report. “There were also no new negative headlines of another bank or funds in trouble, which allows investors’ sentiments to settle down.”Market jitters about more interest rate hikes to dampen economic activity and inflation were temporarily overshadowed by anxiety about the U.S. financial system following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank on Friday and Signature Bank on Sunday. President Joe Biden and regulators tried to assure the public risks were contained and deposits in other banks were safe.Tuesday's data showed core inflation, with volatile energy and food prices stripped out to show a clearer trend, was 0.5% in February over the previous month, edging up from January's 0.4% gain. The Fed pays close attention to core inflation in making monetary policy.Signs of enduring upward pressure on prices usually add to expectations of more rate hikes, but the Fed faces a dilemma over how to respond to stress on the banking system. Many are under strain after the fastest pace of rate hikes in a decade knocked down the prices of their assets.The Shanghai Composite Index rose 0.6% to 3,263.83 and the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo advanced 0.3% to 27,306.80.

New Zealand, Singapore and Jakarta advanced while Bangkok declined.Traders rushed Monday to place bets that the Fed could keep rates steady at its next meeting, instead of accelerating to a hike of 0.50 percentage points, double last month's margin, according to data from CME Group.On Wall Street, the S&P 500 rose 1.7% to 3,920.56, reversing from a three-day string of declines.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.1% to 32,155.40.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834582,"Japan, S. Korea summit must overcome history to renew ties","TOKYO (AP) — South Korean and Japanese leaders will meet in Tokyo this week, hoping to resume regular visits after a gap of over a decade and overcome resentments that date back more than 100 years. The two major Asian economies and United States allies face increasing need to cooperate on challenges posed by China and North Korea, but previous rounds of diplomacy have foundered on unresolved issues from Japan’s 35-year occupation of the Korean Peninsula.Seoul has offered Tokyo concessions on South Korean court orders for compensation over wartime forced labor, but it remains to be seen whether the South Korean public will accept reconciliation.The AP explains what's kept the two neighbors apart, what they're expected to talk about, and why it matters for the region.WHAT ARE THE ISSUES?Japan effectively colonized the Korean Peninsula between 1910 and 1945, in a regime that imposed Japanese names and language on Koreans and conscripted many into forced labor or forced prostitution in military brothels before and during World War II. Japan gave $800 million to South Korea’s military-backed government under a 1965 accord to normalize relations, which were mainly used on economic development projects driven by major South Korean companies. A semi-government fund set up by Tokyo offered compensation to former “comfort women” when the government apologized in 1995, but many South Koreans believe that the Japanese government must take more direct responsibility for the occupation.The two sides also have a longstanding territorial dispute over a group of islands controlled by South Korea but claimed by Japan.Seoul and Tokyo have attempted to establish better ties before. In 2004, leaders began regular visits, but these ended in 2012 after then-South Korean President Lee Myung-bak visited the disputed islands. Tensions escalated over the past 10 years as conservative Japanese governments moved to rearm the country while stepping up attempts to whitewash Japan’s wartime atrocities, and in 2018 South Korea's Supreme Court ordered Japan’s Nippon Steel and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries to compensate forced labor victims. In 2019, Japan, in apparent retaliation, placed export controls against South Korea on chemicals used to make semiconductors and displays used in smartphones and other high-tech devices.WHAT'S EXPECTED AT THE SUMMIT?South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida are to hold a summit and have dinner together during Yoon’s March 16-17 visit. Though leaders have met in multilateral settings, including on the sidelines of a United Nations meeting in New York in September, this is the first formal bilateral summit since a meeting in Seoul in 2015.Kishida is expected to reaffirm Japan’s past expressions of remorse over its wartime actions.Both sides have signaled hopes that this summit will lead to a resumption of regular bilateral visits, although Kishida hasn't yet announced plans for a visit to South Korea. Tokyo is also considering an invitation to Yoon to return to Japan as an observer at the Group of Seven summit Kishida will host in Hiroshima in May.Yoon will be accompanied by high-profile business leaders who are expected to meet their Japanese counterparts. Masakazu Tokura, chair of the Japan Business Federation, said the two sides are considering establishing a separate, private fund to promote bilateral economy, culture and other key areas of cooperation.WHAT'S AT STAKE FOR THE REGION?Improved ties between South Korea and Japan could pave the way for the two U.S. allies to cooperate more closely on shared concerns related to China and North Korea.Washington is eager to get its allies on the same page, and appears to have worked intensively to bring about the summit. U.S. Ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel said his country and its two allies had about 40 trilateral meetings and he thinks cooperation in the process helped to build up trust. While Japan increasingly bolstered defense ties with the U.K., Australia, India and the Philippines, challenges in Japan-South Korea relations were obvious and their closer relationship “in the larger context of our strategic alignment … is a very big deal.”South Korean officials have denied direct pressure from the Biden administration to resolve the historical discord with Tokyo, but the plan is apparently part of South Korean efforts to strengthen security partnerships to counter North Korea, which has been expanding nuclear-capable missiles and issuing threats of preemptive nuclear strikes.While pushing to expand U.S.-South Korea joint military exercises, the Yoon government has sought Washington’s stronger reassurances to swiftly and decisively use its nuclear weapons to protect its ally from North Korea.Seoul and Tokyo last week also announced plans for talks to restore the country’s trade relations, which could relieve pressure from global high-tech supply chains. South Korean officials say stronger economic cooperation with Tokyo has become more crucial in the face of industrial supply chain disruptions and other global challenges.“The need to strengthen South Korea-Japan cooperation has never been greater in the era of complex crises, brought by uncertainties in global geopolitics, North Korea’s continued nuclear and missile testing activity and the disruption in industrial supply chains,” South Korean Vice Foreign Minister Cho Hyundong said last week.HOW ARE JAPAN AND SOUTH KOREA ADDRESSING HISTORY?Experts say that the two countries will have to find an accommodation on history if this round of diplomacy is to achieve lasting results.Choi Eun-mi, an analyst at South Korea’s Asan Institute for Policy Studies, said the summit wouldn’t change South Korean public opinion if it’s all about security and economic matters. “There must be some sort of expression of apologies and self-reflection by Japan, in particular by the Japanese government and the defendant companies,” she said.Seoul made a significant concession prior to the summit, announcing plans to use local funds to pay out compensation from the 2018 court order. South Korea will offer reparations to the plaintiffs through an existing state-run foundation that will raise the money from South Korean companies that benefited from the 1965 accord. It's a major relief for Tokyo, which fears that further South Korean court orders could impose massive compensation demands on hundreds of other Japanese companies that used wartime forced labor.The plan has met fierce opposition from surviving forced labor victims, their supporters, and opposition politicians, who have demanded compensation directly from Japanese companies and a fresh apology from Tokyo. Only three of 15 forced labor victims who won damages in 2018 are still alive, and all three refused to accept South Korean payments in written notes submitted to the foundation, said their lawyer, Lim Jae-sung.South Korean officials say the country's law allows for third-party reimbursements, and that they will do their best to persuade the victims to accept the payments.South Korean officials say they do not expect Nippon Steel or Mitsubishi to immediately contribute to funds for the forced labor victims, and Japan’s Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi said it’s up to Japanese companies to decide whether to contribute to the funds voluntarily.The future of the deal may also rest on whether Kishida’s government can win over South Korean public opinion. South Korean officials express hope that Yoon brings back a “sincere response” from Tokyo as bilateral relations improve.___Kim reported from Seoul, South Korea.___Find more of AP’s Asia-Pacific coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific",2023/3/14,,World

He was invited to deliver a keynote speech at the International Religious Freedom Summit and attend the National Prayer Breakfast.He has been tight-lipped about whom he met during the whirlwind trip except lauding it as a successful example of congressional exchanges.

In this article for our tech blog, we’ll investigate the impact of 5G on society and business.Let’s begin by exploring 5G technology and its differences from prior generations of wireless networks. 5G is the fifth generation of cellular network technology and promises faster data speeds, lower latency, and greater connectivity than its 4G predecessors. This means we’ll be able to download and upload data much more quickly with a more dependable connection.One of the greatest impacts of 5G technology on society is its potential to enhance accessibility and connectivity. With faster speeds and better reliability, more people in remote or underserved areas will have access to high-speed internet, improving their quality of life and expanding opportunities. Furthermore, 5G could enable new applications in healthcare, transportation, and education that would benefit society as a whole.5G technology is expected to have a profound impact on industries such as manufacturing, logistics, and transportation. By connecting more devices and sensors, businesses can improve efficiency and productivity – leading to cost savings and increased profitability. Furthermore, 5G could enable new applications like remote monitoring which would increase safety while decreasing downtime in oil & gas companies.However, 5G technology adoption is not without its challenges. There are potential health risks from exposure to high-frequency electromagnetic radiation – an essential component of 5G technology – as well as privacy and security worries as increased connectivity could create new vulnerabilities which could be exploited by malicious actors.Overall, 5G technology will have a profound effect on society and business. While there may be challenges and risks involved, the advantages of faster speeds, greater connectivity, and new applications cannot be overlooked. As we continue to explore its possibilities, it’s essential that we remain mindful of potential hazards and take proactive steps to mitigate them.",2023/3/14,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834597,7 Reasons To Buy Kids Electric Tractors For A Learning Experience,"Most of the toys that parents purchase for their children offer valuable lessons and an educational experience for youngsters. Of course, kids only understand the fun behind the value of every toy they’re exposed to, and most don’t understand that they’re actually learning fundamental life skills through exposure. Parents will feel at ease knowing that kids’ electric tractors are more than the next cool tech gadget— they offer a wholesome learning experience that helps children progress their skills.Ride-ons are able to help in more ways than one, but the following are the most commonly associated advantages:Most adults find fitness an unpleasant and trying experience, and as such, very few children enjoy staying physically active. One way to help kids immerse themselves in a world filled with fun and fitness combined is by purchasing an electric tractor! Most kids aren’t aware that the amount of effort they put into riding their tractors is actually helping them get their recommended daily exercise. That means parents can rest assured that their children will stay in shape while also coming indoors tired after physical activity.Learning independence from a young age is an important personality trait for growing minds. Though kids should never be left alone to use an electric tractor without adult supervision, it still helps adults keep their distance. Self-directed play is probably one of the most reliable methods for allowing children to gain independence over time. By riding their tractors at their own speed and convenience, children are exposed to the natural world outside which allows them to develop reasoning and thinking skills while drawing their own conclusions.In order for children to feel a sense of self-accomplishment, their toys need to empower them. That means over time, the toys they use should help them progress to different skills. For example, changing a pedal-powered tractor for one with electric technology gradually helps children see their own progress. It allows them to build confidence in their own abilities to master certain toys while also helping them set goals for success. Exposing kids to difficult tasks from an early age means they will have the skills later on in life that enables them to overcome difficult hurdles.Modern kids are leading a sedentary lifestyle that involves moving from bedroom to couch and simply put, spending too much time cooped up inside with electronics. Purchasing a kids’ electric tractor allows parents to hone a sense of love for the outdoors and the environment. By providing an outlet for their enthusiasm, kids are more likely to enjoy spending time outdoors in lieu of choosing to play video games or watch television. It’s also important to consider that learning to love the outdoors early on will mean that a child develops a passion for fitness or outdoor forms of physical activity. Gaining exposure to a natural environment outdoors is the first step to paving the way for good habits well into adulthood.Children have active imaginations, and without a doubt, it’s this way of thinking that enables them to get the most enjoyment out of playtime. Ride-on electric tractors for kids are possibly one of the best toys to expose kids to because they encourage them to visualise all sorts of scenarios that help them imagine an outdoor adventure. With their kid-friendly designs and vivid colours, these tractors are meant to attract growing minds while providing them a solid outlet for their creativity. Pretend play is a fantastic way to encourage children to get out more and to use their creativity in wholesome ways.Many games require children to understand the art of working together as a team and sharing. These are skills that should be taught early on and as a key part of development, collaborative life skills are a must! Purchasing a single tractor for siblings allows them to create a play schedule that helps them share their new toy while also encouraging the sharing of ideas or feelings.Much of what we see on the market today as toys for children are only entertaining for a short while. Kids seem to grow tired and bored of their toys within a short amount of time, and that means the money spent on the toy is wasted. Ride-on tractors are able to entertain for a long time while providing a classic and durable playing experience. What’s more, the adjustable nature of these toys allows kids to grow with them versus outgrowing them as they get older.Kids’ electric tractors are fun toy that enables a learning experience, hones a love of the outdoors, and teaches fundamental life skills. They allow parents to invest in a toy that creates an immersive environment for children while providing years of perfect gameplay!",2023/3/14,,

The study also includes information on manufacturing that can help consumers understand the competitive environment, such as gross margin, shipping, and trade distribution. The research also includes regional, type, and application-specific breakdowns for the global market.The Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprise (MSME) play a pivotal role in the Indian economy. In FY 2021, the MSME industry offered employment to more than 111 million people and was the second-largest employment-generating sector in India (agriculture is the largest).The sector contributes ~29% to the country’s GDP, which is expected to reach 50% by 2025. The industry’s financing needs depend upon the nature, size, customer segments, and stage of development. Financial institutions have limited their lending exposure to the Indian MSME industry due to the high cost of services, the small ticket size of loans, and the limited ability of MSMEs to offer immovable collaterals.In 2020, the overall credit gap in the MSME industry stood at ~INR 14.53 Trn.Download Sample of This Strategic Report–https://www.quadintel.com/request-sample/india-msme-financing-market/QI042Debt Demand of the MSME Sector in India:The overall debt demand by MSMEs amounted to ~ INR 105.50 Trn in 2020. In 2020, the estimated addressable debt demand was INR 44.66 Trn. Approximately 47% of the debt demand is non-addressable because of the presence of sick enterprises, MSMEs with limited operational capacities, and enterprises which voluntarily exclude themselves from formal financial services, as well as other factors.Credit Supply to the MSME Sector in India:In 2020, the overall credit supply, including both the formal and informal sectors, amounted to INR 110.40 Trn. The formal and the informal sectors contribute ~22.72% and ~77.28% to the overall credit supply, respectively.Impact of COVID-19:Small businesses are the most vulnerable to unexpected crises like COVID-19 because of their size, scale of business operations, and limited financial management resources. However, the government has announced several policy measures to minimize losses.
The announcement of a targeted long-term repo operation (TLTRO) of INR 500 Bn, a grant of INR 3 Tn collateral-free automatic loans, INR 200 Bn subordinated debt to stressed MSMEs, and a complete ban on global tenders for procurement of goods and services for up to INR 2 Bn are a few of the crucial policy mandates.Download Sample of This Strategic Report–https://www.quadintel.com/request-sample/india-msme-financing-market/QI042Report Include:Market Behavior/ Level of Risk and Opportunity

Market report information is presented in this report for the given past time frame. The study also includes information on manufacturing that can help consumers understand the competitive environment, such as gross margin, shipping, and trade distribution. The research also includes regional, type, and application-specific breakdowns for the global market.The auto ancillary market deals with the production and sale of intermediate equipment and automotive parts that are used in automobile manufacturing. It is a crucial part of the automotive industry in India. It is segmented into organized and unorganized sectors. The organized sector serves original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and deals in high-value instruments. The unorganized sector provides the aftermarket with low-value tools and parts. The business is moving toward the production of electric vehicle parts and components. It is expected that by 2025, the auto ancillary market in India will become the third-largest in the world.Market insights:The performance of the automotive industry impacts the auto ancillary market. The auto sector has been facing a slump since FY 2019, mostly due to weak consumer sentiments and tightening of liquidity in non-banking financial companies and other lending institutions. Furthermore, it was affected by strict lockdown measures in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, with the enactment of new regulatory measures and adoption of advanced technologies, the sector is expected to gain momentum from 2021 onwards.In terms of revenue, the OEM suppliers segment holds the largest market share (~55.98%), followed by exports and aftermarket. However, in terms of the number of players, the market is dominated by the aftermarket segment.Impact of COVID-19:Auto ancillary producers faced the challenge of subdued demand and manufacturing restrictions induced by COVID-19-related safety measures. The Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) reported a 14.07% reduction in automobile production in FY 2021. Following the decline in sales, automobile manufacturers curtailed orders to auto ancillary suppliers and producers. Export of auto ancillary products also dropped in FY 2021 due to international production cuts. However, the market started expanding at a robust pace after the third quarter of FY 2021 with the gradual growth of the automobile industry.Request To Download Sample of This Strategic Report: –https://www.quadintel.com/request-sample/india-auto-ancillary-market/QI042Government initiatives:The government has formulated various policies to boost the growth of the market. Auto Policy 2002, Automotive Mission Plan 2016-2026, National Automotive Testing and R&D Infrastructure Project (NATRIP), and National Electric Mobility Mission Plan 2020 (NEMMP), are a few significant programs launched by the government. Other initiatives include providing R&D incentives for industry- and private-sponsored research, granting export subsidy under the Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS), and offering incentives to players operating in Special Economic Zones.Key growth drivers of the market:The enforcement of BS-VI standards of safety and emission is anticipated to help the export market expand during the forecast period for the benefit of auto component players in India
Foreign players prefer India because it is a cost-effective location for manufacturing, which bodes well for the auto ancillary marketKey deterrents to the growth of the market:Even though annual production of the overall automotive industry has improved, consumption in recent quarters (2019 onwards) experienced a decline mainly due to a liquidity crisis for Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs)
Moreover, the lack of research and development infrastructure and quality standards is a threat to the marketCompetition analysis:The auto ancillary market is highly fragmented, the organized sector (OEMs) being dominated by leading players such as Bharat Forge Limited, Mahindra CIE Automotive Limited, Bosch Limited, and Sundram Fasteners Limited.Download Free Sample of This Strategic Report–https://www.quadintel.com/request-sample/india-auto-ancillary-market/QI042Report Include:Market Behavior/ Level of Risk and Opportunity

The research also includes regional, type, and application-specific breakdowns for the global market.Major players in the market include Opto Circuits Limited, Philips India Limited, Siemens Limited, TTK Healthcare Limited, and Appasamy Associates.Medical technology involves the application of science to develop cure-based solutions. The medical technology market comprises players supplying health devices and instruments, diagnostic equipment and reagents, bionics, implants, disposables, and consumables to the healthcare providers. India is a profitable destination to major global players, owing to increase in income levels, private sector participation in healthcare, an aging population, and growth of medical tourism. It is at a nascent stage and fragmented, mostly depending on imports, with limited capabilities for indigenous manufacturing. The rapidly evolving technology landscape, conducive financial mechanism, and governmental thrust through the Make in India initiatives are projected to expedite the business in the coming years.Impact of COVID-19In the wake of the pandemic, the market witnessed a supply-demand gap. While the demand for personal protective equipment rose steeply, the supply side was massively constrained due to lockdown measures, undertaken in 2020. The revenue fell sharply in the first quarter of FY 2021 on account of reduced sales volume of non-COVID-19 items. Firms adopted various strategies to boost production capacities, collect payment from creditors, and address the changes in demand to maintain business.Download Sample of This Strategic Report: –https://www.quadintel.com/request-sample/india-medical-technology-market/QI042Market segment insightsThe market is segmented into instruments and appliances, diagnostic imaging, consumables and implants, and patient aids and other technologies. Instruments and appliances segment dominated the market in 2020, accounting for 33.72% of the total revenue in 2020. It is estimated that patient aids and other technologies will be the fastest-growing segment during the forecast period.Key growth driversAn increase in the demand for new medical applications has led to the growth of the medical technology market. For instance, improved surgical techniques and new implant materials for joint replacement (e.g., hybrid replacement method used in hip replacement surgery) are driving the growth of the orthopaedic segment
In India, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are a major health problem. For instance, cancer, obesity, and diabetes are on the rise because of sedentary lifestyle and high stress levels. By 2025, NCDs would account for 75% of the disease burden. The significant increase in non-communicable diseases is driving demand for medical technology market.Key deterrents to the growth of the marketShortage of healthcare professionals and poor infrastructure are the major constraints. According to the World Bank, as of 2021, India has only 0.66 physicians per 1,000 patients. Indias bed density stands at 1.1 per 1,000 people, considerably lower than the World Health Organization (WHO) standards of 3.5 beds per 1,000 person.Download Free Sample of This Strategic Report –https://www.quadintel.com/request-sample/india-medical-technology-market/QI042Report Include:Market Behavior/ Level of Risk and Opportunity

The research also includes regional, type, and application-specific breakdowns for the global market.The frozen food market, which comprises chilled fruits and vegetables, snacks, meat, poultry and seafood, and ready-to-cook meals, has grown significantly in recent years. Rapid rise in the number of modern retail and online grocery stores, and proper refrigeration facilities are the primary reasons for this development. Improved shelf-life and packaging of frozen foods has further propelled growth. Some of the key players that operate in this market are Apex Frozen Foods Ltd., Godrej Agrovet Ltd., ITC Ltd., and Venky’s (India) Ltd.Market insights:Increase in the number of millennial and gen-Z consumers opting for convenience food, improved awareness, and acceptance of frozen food are some of the major factors that propelled market growth. In the wake of the pandemic, the e-commerce business has expanded, resulting in high demand for frozen food items. Development of the cold chain infrastructure and constant support from the government are further driving the market. However, inadequate cold storage and poor supply infrastructure hinder its expansion.Segment insights:Based on sales channel, the market is segmented into retailers, food service providers, and export. In terms of revenue, the export segment dominated the market, accounting for 44.62% of the overall revenue in 2020. The food service business was severely impacted due to COVID-19 in 2020, and the second and third quarter of 2021. Retailers is the fastest-growing segment because the demand for packaged French fries, burgers, and chicken snacks has picked up amid the pandemic.COVID-19 impact analysis:The COVID-19 pandemic has positively impacted the frozen food market. However, growth was interrupted during the second wave (April 2021 May 2021). Nonetheless, steady recovery of retailers and food service providers is expected to drive the market during the forecast period. Consumers’ perception toward the processed frozen food products changed positively as these items ensured better sanitization than the foods available from street-side vendors. During the pandemic, various food and grocery delivery start-ups such as Licious, iD Fresh Foods, and Grofers reported an increase in the sale of ready-to-eat and frozen food items.Download Free Sample of This Strategic Report–https://www.quadintel.com/request-sample/india-frozen-foods-market/QI042Report Include:Market Behavior/ Level of Risk and Opportunity

Teachers could not complete the syllabus, exams were postponed, and were cancelled in several cases due to the implementation of intermittent lockdowns. Private institutions completed the curriculum by offering online classes and making course materials available to students. Although schools have reopened in most parts of the country, classroom attendance remains low at around 30%. Although vaccination for 15 years to 18 years have started, most parents are afraid to send their children to school.Market drivers:
Private educational institutions are equipped with advanced facilities. Also, the advanced curriculum followed by private schools are beneficial for getting jobs. International collaborations have encouraged students to enroll in private colleges due to the exposure to exciting courses.Key deterrents to the growth of the market:
Private institutions tend to focus on providing better infrastructure than quality education.

This is because of government initiatives that propelled export possibilities.Market insights:
The pharmaceutical industry has witnessed rapid growth in the past few decades and is expected to develop further, owing to huge export possibilities.

The onslaught of COVID-19 and the nationwide lockdown severely impacted the healthcare and pharmaceutical infrastructure, and the countrys economy.

The study also includes information on manufacturing that can help consumers understand the competitive environment, such as gross margin, shipping, and trade distribution. The research also includes regional, type, and application-specific breakdowns for the global market.In India, there are approximately 562 medical colleges under the National Medical Commission (NMC). Admission to medical institutions is based on the National Eligibility Entrance Test (NEET) ranks. There are ~50.89% government medical colleges and ~49.11% private medical colleges in the country. The private medical colleges are equipped with advanced laboratories, along with highly-educated teaching faculty.Market insights:Private medical institutions have more number of seats than government medical colleges but admission charges and cost of the course are significantly high. At present there are 276 private medical colleges in India. According to an NMC data, around 37 applications were received to establish private medical colleges for the academic year 2021 2022. Around 15 private medical colleges were set up between 2020 and 2021. Increase in the number of seats in private medical colleges and growing investment opportunities for the same are some of the important factors driving the growth of the market. However, inadequate healthcare infrastructure, inappropriate doctor to patient ratio and high admission and course fees are the key challenges to the growth of the market. Moreover, Medical facilities are not equitably distributed throughout the country. Patients are sometimes required to go abroad for treatment purposes as they are unsure about the success rate of the therapy in India. Several seats in private colleges are reserved for management quota, thus, blocking the seats of some deserving candidates. Although the number of medical seats has increased, it is still not sufficient because of the vast population of the country.Download Sample of This Strategic Report: –https://www.quadintel.com/request-sample/india-private-medical-colleges-market/QI042Impact of COVID-19:Several private medical colleges were converted into COVID-19 hospitals in 2020. Most of them were used as quarantine centers for infected patients to remain isolated. The All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) issued a circular instructing the listed institutes and colleges not to insist on payment of fees, including admission charges. However, in private colleges and deemed universities, medical students, many of whom are at the forefront of India’s medical response to the COVID-19 pandemic, have received no such protection.Government initiatives:The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW) announced a centrally-sponsored scheme in 2021 to upgrade existing state/central government medical colleges to raise the number of MBBS seats. 90% of the investment is made by central government and the rest is borne by the states. Under public-private partnerships, the central government will fund the viability gap to the tune of 60% -80% of the cost of establishing medical colleges in existing district hospitals.Download Sample of This Strategic Report–https://www.quadintel.com/request-sample/india-private-medical-colleges-market/QI042Report Include:Market Behavior/ Level of Risk and Opportunity

The study also includes information on manufacturing that can help consumers understand the competitive environment, such as gross margin, shipping, and trade distribution. The research also includes regional, type, and application-specific breakdowns for the global market.Market insightsHospitals are the major stakeholders in India’s healthcare ecosystem. About 70% of the rural population and 80% of the urban residents rely on private hospitals. High disposable income, rise in population, and changes in disease profiles are driving the expansion of the market. Furthermore, the Ayushman Bharat initiative has strengthened the healthcare system, from primary to tertiary care.Segment insights:It has three segments self-pay, government payer, and corporate insurer. Initially at the beginning of 2020, the self-pay segment dominated the market, followed by government payer. However, owing to the expansion of insurance coverage by both government and corporate insurers, the corporate insurer segment is anticipated to experience noticeable growth.
Increase in purchasing power, growing demand for quality healthcare, technological advancements, and development of private hospital networks have fueled the growth of corporate medical insurance. It ensures patients entitlement to accidental hospitalization, COVID-19 insurance, daily hospital benefits, critical illness cover, and maternity coverage.Impact of COVID-19:The second wave of COVID-19 affected the private hospital sector because patient footfall, both, domestic and international, declined. High infection rates and lockdowns compelled hospitals to pause non-emergency, and outdoor patient department (OPD) and indoor patient department (IPD) services. Medical tourism also declined due to travel restrictions.Despite the initial dip in footfall, signs of recovery in patients and relaxed lockdown norms by the end of July 2021 marked an increase in hospital occupancy rate. Although the initial setback caused a nationwide crisis in India’s primary healthcare, key changes in the sector such as flexibility in operations, improved health insurance, and cost-effective medical tourism will strengthen the private hospital sector.Download Free Sample of This Strategic Report –https://www.quadintel.com/request-sample/india-private-hospital-market/QI042Report Include:Market Behavior/ Level of Risk and Opportunity

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834660,Ukraine updates: Zelenskyy says future depends on Bakhmut,"Ukraine's future depends on a victory in Bakhmut and elsewhere along the front line, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his evening address on Monday.Bakhmut has become the main focus of Russia's assault, where it has captured the eastern part of the city.""It is very tough in the east — very painful. We have to destroy the enemy's military power. And we will destroy it,"" Zelenskyy said.Russia says taking Bakhmut would allow it to capture the rest of the Donetsk region — a key war aim for the Kremlin.But in recent weeks, trench warefare has claimed a huge toll for both sides in Bakhmut.On Monday, Ukrainian soldiers said they were repelling intensified Russian attacks in the city.Zelenskyy said the front line towns are where ""the kind of future we are to have is being decided, where the future of all Ukrainians is being fought for.""Here are some of the other notable developments concerning the war on Tuesday, March 14:A deal allowing the safe export of grain from Ukraine's Black Sea ports will be extended automatically after it expires on March 18 if there are no objections from the involved parties, Russia's TASS state news agency reported.Citing an unnamed source familiar with the details of the negotiations around the agreement, TASS reported that so far none of the involved sides had indicated a withdrawal.Russia on Monday suggested renewing a deal allowing the safe export of grain from Ukraine's Black Sea ports but only for half of the 120-day term of the previous renewal, while the United Nations pledged to do everything possible to ensure the agreement's integrity remained intact.The source said that the time length of the extension did not matter. ""If the deal is extended for 60 days, it will continue to operate after March 18, and after 60 days one of the parties may raise the issue of its termination,"" the source added.German fighter jets stationed on NATO's eastern flank have been deployed 27 times since last August after being alerted to unknown aircraft in the Baltic region, according to the German air force, or Luftwaffe.During the deployments, the German forces identified Russian military aircraft above the Baltic Sea, a spokesperson told dpa in Berlin.The German Luftwaffe's Eurofighter Typhoons are alerted when unknown aircraft approach the Baltic airspace without a transponder signal or radio contact.The three Baltic republics and NATO members Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania lack their own air forces. NATO makes use of bases at Ämari and Siauliai in Lithuania to police the airspace over the Baltic region.NATO allies station the planes along with support staff at the bases in rotation. Germany has participated in the mission since 2005.Moscow has not been informed about the progress of an investigation into last year's Nord Stream pipeline blasts and has handed in a report to prove this to the United Nations, a senior Russian diplomat said.Russia has prepared an ""official document"" based on its correspondence with Denmark, Sweden and Germany and has given copies of it to the UN Security Council and the UN General Assembly, said Dmitry Polyanskiy, Russia's deputy UN ambassador.""The documents allow our colleagues at the UN to verify that the allegations that these countries have informed us of the progress of their investigations are not true,"" Polyanskiy said on the Telegram messaging platform.The September 26 explosions on the pipelines connecting Russia and Germany occurred in the exclusive economic zones of Sweden and Denmark. Denmark, Germany and Sweden told the Security Council in a joint letter in February that the ""Russian authorities have been informed regarding the ongoing investigations"" by their national authorities.Some military analysts in Ukraine have questioned Zelenskyy's decision to continue defending Bakhmut, rather than withdraw from the front line city.""As of now we have information that Ukraine is sending reserves to Bakhmut that underwent training in Western countries. And we are suffering losses among reserves that we intended to use for counter-offensives,"" Ukrainian military analyst Oleh Zhdanov said in an interview with the Reuters news agency.""We could lose here everything we wanted to use for those counter-offensives.""Ukrainian military historian Roman Ponomarenko was also concerned about the potential losses if Russia manages to encircle the city.""If we simply give up Bakhmut and withdraw our troops and equipment, nothing terrible can happen ... if they seal the ring, we will lose men and equipment,"" he told Ukrainian radio station NV.French President Emmanuel Macron had a working dinner with Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban to discuss European unity on Monday night.Unlike most European Union leaders, Orban has been openly critical of the bloc's stance towards the invasion of Ukraine, which he has previously called an ""indirect war"" against Russia. He has pledged to maintain relations with Russia but nevertheless sided with EU sanctions.During the meeting, Macron ""reaffirmed the need for the unity of European countries in their support for Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression, particularly via the strict application of sanctions,"" his office said afterwards.The two leaders also touched on the proposed accession of Finland and Sweden into NATO. Hungary is the only NATO member other than Turkey that has not ratified both countries' bids.Ukraine's military says Russia is using hypersonic missiles in attacks across the country. DW looks at what makes these missiles different to conventional missiles, and how they're able to evade interception for longer.Russian lawmakers want to crack down harder on individuals who criticize the troops fighting against Ukraine. DW investigates how these legal changes will impact Russian society.zc/rt (AP, AFP, Reuters, dpa)",2023/3/14,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834675,"Netanyahu critics urge Germany, Britain to cancel his visit","JERUSALEM (AP) — Hundreds of Israeli writers, artists and intellectuals on Tuesday called on Germany and Britain to cancel upcoming visits by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying his plan to overhaul Israel’s judicial system has put the country on a destructive course.Netanyahu’s coalition, a collection of ultranationalist and ultra-Orthodox parties, has barreled ahead with legislation that aims to weaken Israel’s Supreme Court and give them control over the appointment of the nation’s judges.They say the plan is a long-overdue measure to curb what they see as outsize influence by unelected judges. But critics say the plan will destroy Israel’s fragile system of checks and balances by concentrating power in the hands of Netanyahu and his parliamentary majority. They also say it is attempt by Netanyahu, who is on trial for corruption charges, to escape justice.Tens of thousands of Israelis have taken to the streets over the past two months to protest the sweeping overhaul. Protests last week were so large that Netanyahu was forced to take a helicopter to the airport in order to catch a flight for an official visit to Italy.High-tech leaders, Nobel-winning economists and prominent security officials have spoken out against it, military reservists have threatened to stop reporting for duty and even some of Israel’s closest allies, including the U.S., have urged Netanyahu to slow down. Repeated efforts by Israel’s figurehead president, Isaac Herzog, to broker a compromise have not yielded fruit.In a letter addressed to the German and British ambassadors in Israel, some 1,000 Israeli figures said Tuesday that Israel is in the midst of the most extreme crisis in its history and that Netanyahu is trying to turn the country into a “theocratic dictatorship.”“In the face of Mr. Netanyahu’s dangerous and destructive leadership, and in light of a vast democratic civilian resistance against the destruction of state institutions by undemocratic law-making, we are asking that Germany and Great Britain swiftly announce to the defendant Netanyahu that his planned state visits to your countries are canceled,” reads the letter. “If these visits go ahead as planned, a dark shadow will hang over them.”The letter was signed by internationally acclaimed author David Grossman, novelist Dorit Rabinyan, Oscar-nominated director Uri Barbash and scores of academics, business figures and professionals.Netanyahu is scheduled to meet German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Thursday in Berlin, where Israeli expats say they are organizing a large protest against their visiting prime minister.Netanyahu returned to power in December, following the country's fifth election in under four years, at the head of the most right-wing government in Israel's 75-year history.",2023/3/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834676,AP PHOTOS: Objects of war become new normal in Kyiv,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — There are sandbags around the statues and anti-tank obstacles by the side of the streets, trenches in the nearby forests and land mine warnings in the woods. Signs painted on walls point to the nearest shelter, while air raid sirens occasionally wail across the city, which still sometimes comes under missile attack.But against this backdrop of war, residents of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, are living their lives as normally as they can while Russia’s invasion of their country continues into its second year.Although many fled in the opening stages of the war, residents have gradually returned to their homes as Russian forces were pushed back from north of the city last year, and the conflict became centered mainly in the eastern and southern parts of Ukraine.Shops, restaurants and bars are open — even if customers have to wrap up their evenings early and rush home in time for the 11 p.m. curfew. Nobody pays attention to the angular steel anti-tank hedgehogs by the side of the road, or the occasional pile of sandbags.Outside the landmark Saint Michael’s Golden-Domed Monastery in central Kyiv, people pose for photos beside destroyed Russian tanks and armored vehicles. Nearby, yet more photos are being added to a wall with pictures of those killed in the fight against Russia.It’s a strange type of new normality, where the harsh objects of a brutal war have been incorporated into the scenery of regular city life.___Follow AP’s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",2023/3/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834677,Chinese SARS whistleblower Jiang Yanyong dies at 91,"BEIJING (AP) — Jiang Yanyong, a Chinese military doctor who revealed the full extent of the 2003 SARS outbreak and was later placed under house arrest for his political outspokenness, has died, a long-time acquaintance and a Hong Kong newspaper said Tuesday.Jiang was 91 and died of pneumonia Saturday in Beijing, according to human rights activist Hu Jia and the South China Morning Post.News of Jiang's death and even his name were censored within China, underscoring how he remained a politically sensitive figure even late in life.Jiang had been chief surgeon at the People’s Liberation Army’s main 301 hospital in Beijing when the army fought its way through the city to end weeks of student-led pro-democracy protests centered on Tiananmen Square, causing the deaths of hundreds — possibly thousands — of civilians.In April 2003, as the ruling Communist Party was suppressing news about the outbreak of the highly contagious Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, Jiang wrote an 800-word letter stating there were many more SARS cases than were being officially reported by the country's health minister.Jiang emailed the letter to state broadcaster CCTV and Hong Kong’s Beijing-friendly Phoenix Channel, both of which ignored it. The letter was then leaked to Western media outlets that published it in its entirety, along with reports on the true extent of the outbreak and official Chinese efforts to hide it.The letter, along with the death of a Finnish United Nations employee and statements by renowned physician Zhong Nanshan, forced the lifting of government suppression, leading to the resignations of both the health minister and Beijing's mayor. Strict containment measures were imposed virtually overnight, helping to restrain the spread of the virus that had already begun appearing overseas.In all, more than 8,000 people from 29 countries and territories were infected with SARS, resulting in at least 774 deaths.“Jiang had the conscience of a doctor to people the patients first. He saved so many lives with that letter, without thought for the consequences,” Hu told The Associated Press.Chinese authorities later sought to block media access to Jiang, who retired with the rank of major general. He turned down an interview with The Associated Press, saying he had been unable to obtain the necessary permission from the Ministry of Defense.From 2004, Jiang and his wife were periodically placed under house arrest for appealing to Communist leaders for a re-evaluation of the 1989 protests that remains a taboo topic. That recalled Jiang's earlier experiences when he was persecuted as a rightist under Mao Zedong during the 1950s, ’60s and ’70s.In 2004, Jiang was awarded the Ramon Magsaysay Award for Public Service from the Philippines, considered by some an Asian version of the Nobel Peace Prize. In the citation, he was praised for having broken ""China’s habit of silence and forced the truth of SARS into the open.""Jiang was prevented from leaving the country and the award was collected by his daughter on his behalf.Three years later, he won the Heinz R. Pagels Human Rights of Scientists Award given by the New York Academy of Sciences, but was again blocked from traveling.Echoes of Jiang's experience were heard in China's approach to the initial outbreak of COVID-19, first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019.A Wuhan eye doctor, Li Wenliang, was detained and threatened by police for allegedly spreading rumors on social media following an attempt to alert others about a “SARS-like” virus. Li's death on Feb. 7, 2020, sparked widespread outrage against the Chinese censorship system. Users posted criticism for hours before censors moved to delete posts.Sympathy and the outpouring of anger of the treatment of Li and other whistleblowers prompted the government to change course and declare him and 13 others martyrs.COVID-19 has killed almost 7 million people worldwide, including an estimated 1.5 million in China, whose government has been accused of massively undercounting the true number of deaths.Jiang is survived by his wife, Hua Zhongwei, a son and a daughter, according to the South China Morning Post.",2023/3/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834678,Key dates in Recep Tayyip Erdogan's 20-year rule of Turkey,"ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who is seeking a third consecutive term in office in elections in May, marks 20 years in power on Tuesday.The 69-year-old, who served as prime minister from 2003-2014 and as president thereafter, started as a reformist who expanded rights and freedoms, allowing his majority-Muslim country to start European Union membership negotiations.He later reversed course, cracking down on dissent, stifling the media and passing measures that eroded democracy.The presidential and parliamentary elections set for May 14 could be Erdogan’s most challenging yet. They will be held amid economic turmoil and high inflation, just three months after a devastating earthquake that killed tens of thousands.Here’s a look at some of the key dates during Erdogan’s rule:March 27, 1994: Erdogan is elected mayor of Istanbul, running on the pro-Islamic Welfare Party ticket.Dec. 12, 1997: Erdogan is convicted of “inciting hatred” for reading a poem that the courts deem to be in violation of Turkey’s secular principles, and sentenced to four months in prison.Aug. 14, 2001: Erdogan, who broke away from the Welfare Party with other members of its reformist wing, forms the conservative Justice and Development Party, or AKP.Nov. 3, 2002: A year after it is founded, AKP wins a parliamentary majority in general elections. Erdogan however, is barred from running due to his conviction.March 9, 2003: Erdogan is elected to parliament in a by-election after his political ban is lifted.March 14: 2003: Erdogan replaces his AKP colleague Abdullah Gul as prime minister.Oct. 3, 2005: Turkey begins accession talks with the European Union after Erdogan’s government introduces a series of reforms.July 22, 2007: Erdogan wins 46.6% of the votes in general elections.March 31, 2008: Constitutional Court accepts an indictment seeking the AKP’s closure for acts allegedly in violation of secularism. The court eventually rules not to shutter the party but cuts treasury financing for political parties.October 20, 2008: The first of a series of trials against military officers, lawmakers and public figures begins. The suspects are accused of plotting to overthrow the government, in what turn out to be sham trials based on faked evidence and designed to eliminate Erdogan’s opponents. The trials were later blamed on the network of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen.Sept. 12, 2010: Erdogan wins a referendum on constitutional changes that allow the government to appoint high court judges, curb the powers of the military and ensure presidents are elected by a national vote rather than by parliament.June 12, 2011: Erdogan wins general elections with a landslide 49.8% of the vote.May 28, 2013: Nationwide anti-government protests erupt over plans to cut down trees in Istanbul’s central Gezi Park. Turkey’s largest ever protests result in eight deaths, while the government is accused of using excessive force against protesters.Aug. 10, 2014: Erdogan wins Turkey’s first presidential election held by direct popular vote. Although the post is largely ceremonial, he is accused of exceeding his powers and meddling in the running of the country.June 7, 2015: The AKP, headed by Ahmet Davutoglu after Erdogan became president, loses its majority in parliamentary elections, and is forced to seek a coalition.Nov. 1, 2015: AKP regains a parliamentary majority in re-run elections following months of insecurity, including suicide bombings by the Islamic State group and reignition of a decades-long conflict with Kurdish militants.July 15, 2016: Erdogan’s government survives a military coup attempt blamed on followers of U.S.-based cleric Gulen, a former ally. The failed coup results in nearly 290 deaths. The government then embarks on a large-scale crackdown on Gulen’s network, arresting tens of thousands and purging more than 130,000 from government jobs. Many media and nongovernmental organizations are closed down and the crackdown then expands to critics, including Kurdish lawmakers and journalists. The EU accession talks, which had made slow progress, are frozen amid the democratic backtracking.April 16, 2017: Voters in a referendum narrowly approve switching the country’s political system from a parliamentary democracy to an executive presidential system, abolishing the post of prime minister and concentrating a vast amount of power in the hands of the president. Critics call the system a “one-man rule.”June 24, 2018: Erdogan wins presidential elections with 52.59% of the vote, becoming Turkey’s first president with executive powers, while his party’s alliance with a nationalist party secures a majority in parliament.June 22, 2019: Erdogan’s party loses re-run election for Istanbul mayor by a landslide after it contests March elections which the main opposition party’s candidate had narrowly won. It’s the first time since Erdogan’s mayoral win in 1994 that his party and its predecessors lose Turkey’s most important city.Feb. 6, 2023: A powerful earthquake devastates parts of Turkey and Syria, killing more than 48,000 people in Turkey. Erdogan’s government is criticized for its poor response to the disaster and for failing to prepare the country for a large-scale quake.___Associated Press writer Zeynep Bilginsoy contributed from Istanbul.",2023/3/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834679,Aussie rules players launch legal action over concussions,"MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — A class action has been launched on behalf of Australian rules footballers who have sustained concussion-related injuries while playing or preparing for professional games in the national league since 1985.Margalit Injury Lawyers filed the action in Victoria state’s Supreme Court on Tuesday.Outside the court, lawyer Michel Margalit said the firm was seeking about 2 million Australian dollars ($1.35million) plus medical expenses per player. More than 60 former players or the families of dead players have already joined the class action.Margalit said it could cost the AFL close to 1 billion Australian dollars ($666 million).“But we must remember that this is not about bringing down the AFL,” Margalit said in comments reported by Australian Associated Press. ""This is about compensating these injured players.”The lead plaintiff is Jarad Maxwell Rooke, who played 135 games for Geelong between 2001 and October 2010. The class action alleges Rooke sustained permanent and life-altering injuries as a result of concussion-related injuries and because of the AFL’s negligence.The identities of other players involved in the action have not been published.“Their careers are finished and years later they find these concussion-related injuries creeping in and affecting their ability to work, their ability to have a happy family life,” Margalit said.The Melbourne-based AFL is the highest-rating sport in Australia and the top-flight national league has teams in every mainland state.The AFL said it hadn't yet received formal correspondence regarding the class action, but added that it takes concussions “and the protection of the brain health of all those playing our game extremely seriously.”The AFL said it had this week updated concussion-related guidelines for the top flight, where players diagnosed with concussion must pass an 11-step return to play protocol over a minimum of 12 days before being medically cleared.The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners last month warned governments and sporting bodies that they must do more to limit the long-term impacts of concussions and repeated head trauma, and submitted a report to an Australian Senate inquiry into concussions and head trauma in contact sports.Increased reporting of athletes struggling with post-concussion syndrome and suspected chronic traumatic encephalopathy , or CTE, have given the issue wider public exposure.The death of star Australian rules football player and coach Danny Frawley was reported widely across the country. Last year, a Victoria state coroner recommended that AFL players be encouraged to donate their brains post-mortem to science to help further the understanding of CTE, a degenerative brain disease found in people with a history of repetitive brain trauma.Frawley, who’d been suffering from anxiety and depression, died at the age of 56 in a car crash in 2019 and a post-mortem examination revealed he had CTE, which can only be diagnosed by autopsy.The effects of concussions on athletes in professional contact sports is well-documented. In the United States., Boston University CTE Center has done studies which show that more than 300 National Football League players have developed chronic traumatic encephalopathy.___More AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/14,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834698,Taiwan consortium's project to develop adaptable EV architecture,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Jack Cheng (鄭顯聰) is the chief executive officer at MIH Consortium, and recently spoke to Startup Island TAIWAN Podcast about the group's work to create an open electric vehicle (EV) platform and reduce development times for new entrants to the EV market.Cheng has a long history in the automotive industry, joining Ford in the 1980s when the company was developing Taiwan as a manufacturing base for vehicles sold in the North American market. Cheng said he began working with EVs when he was asked to collaborate with Chinese companies in 2015, which led him to work on building the Nio EV brand.Cheng said Nio developed an EV to production stage in 30 months, when normally it would take a new company three to four years. He said that MIH hopes to help other EV startups develop vehicles in similarly short timeframes by developing an open architecture upon which new EV companies can build their end user product.Cheng used the example of the Jaguar X-type, built on the same platform as the Ford Mondeo, a basic family wagon. Manufacturers with very different end users were able to develop vehicles that suited their customers’ needs using the same basic platform.“There are ... a lot of new brands for EVs, they never get the components or the architecture platform to begin,"" Cheng said. “It’s such a rigid process for them to go bidding and do all this benchmarking and try to get a business where there is already a supply base for the traditional guy.”Cheng said that MIH creates a “half complete” vehicle, akin to a simple battery pack on wheels. Companies can then take this platform and build on it, adapting the form to their user base.MIH was founded by Taiwan's electronics giant Foxconn, which purchased an EV production facility in Ohio in May last year to manufacture the EV platform. In November 2022, the company broke ground on an EV production facility in Thailand, which reportedly will also be a production base for the MIH platform.",2023/3/14,730,Business
