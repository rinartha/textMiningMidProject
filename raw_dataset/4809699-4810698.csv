https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809711,Beijing eases meeting rule for US top diplomat in Hong Kong,"Hong Kong (AP) — The United States consul general no longer needs to secure China’s approval before meeting officials in the semi-autonomous Chinese city of Hong Kong, after a rule put in place during heightened tensions between Washington and Beijing was relaxed.

            Under the new requirement, which started in November, Beijing must be given prior notice, replacing a previous arrangement that required the top diplomat to seek permission from China's foreign affairs office in the city before having such meetings, the U.S. Consulate in Hong Kong told The Associated Press on Tuesday. 

            The rule relaxation would make it easier for the consul general to have direct exchanges with officials in Hong Kong as part of its normal diplomatic practice. The previous rule was introduced in 2020 during heightened tensions between the U.S. and China. 











            “Per requirements established by the People’s Republic of China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA), the Consul General currently notifies the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong of meetings with local government officials and government educational institutions five days in advance,” the consulate stated in an email. 

            Asked about the rule change, Hong Kong leader John Lee said the Hong Kong government would welcome any exchanges for improving business, cultural ties and works that can help promote the city. 

            “Hong Kong government officials, of course, will also be in contact with different people, including officials from different consulates, so as to enhance exchanges,” Lee said, and the government would act in accordance with the Vienna Convention.

            Hong Kong returned to China's rule in 1997 under the promise that the former British colony could retain its own political, social and financial institutions for 50 years. 

            In recent years, it has become a talking point between the U.S. and China as critics say the promise is becoming increasingly threadbare, especially after Beijing imposed the 2020 National Security Law, which jailed or silenced many dissidents.Hong Kong (AP) — The United States consul general no longer needs to secure China’s approval before meeting officials in the semi-autonomous Chinese city of Hong Kong, after a rule put in place during heightened tensions between Washington and Beijing was relaxed.Under the new requirement, which started in November, Beijing must be given prior notice, replacing a previous arrangement that required the top diplomat to seek permission from China's foreign affairs office in the city before having such meetings, the U.S. Consulate in Hong Kong told The Associated Press on Tuesday.The rule relaxation would make it easier for the consul general to have direct exchanges with officials in Hong Kong as part of its normal diplomatic practice.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809712,Red Wings trounce struggling Canucks 6-1,"VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) — Dylan Larkin scored twice and the Detroit Red Wings beat the struggling Vancouver Canucks 6-1 Wednesday night for their third straight win.

            Robby Fabbri and Gustav Lindstrom each had a goal and an assist, and Pius Suter and Jonatan Berggren also scored for the Red Wings. Michael Rasmussen had two assists and Ville Husso made 29 saves, including a late penalty shot.

            It was the Red Wings’ second lopsided win in the last three days against the Canucks after winning 5-2 in Detroit on Saturday.











            “It’s tough to beat anybody in this league two times in a row,” Detroit coach Derek Lalonde said. “And especially with the noon game (on Saturday), the travel, it’s a five-hour flight for us and we’ve basically been on a go for eight days in a row and we’ve had four long practices this week along with the three games.

            “You don’t know what to expect and what our legs were but our guys responded extremely well. They were great from the get-go.”

            Sheldon Dries scored for Vancouver and Collin Delia stopped 17 shots. The Canucks have given up five or more goals in 25 of 54 games this season.

            The Canucks were awarded a penalty shot with 59.4 seconds left on the clock when Husso was called for delay of game when the net came down over his back as Elias Pettersson tried to jam a shot in from the side of the net.

            Phillip Di Giuseppe skated in and sent a quick wrist shot off the goalie’s blocker.

            Detroit took a 3-1 lead into the third period after Larkin scored twice in the first and Fabbri added to the cushion midway through the second.

            The Red Wings piled on in the third, scoring three times in a 7:12 span.

            Lindstrom made it a three-goal lead just 40 seconds into the period. Rasmussen got the puck at the side of the net, tried a wraparound shot before Lindstrom finally jammed the puck in for his first goal of the season.

            Suter added to the lead at 5:19 when he blasted a shot past Delia from the low slot.

            Berggren sealed it at 7:52 a he got a slick pass from Joe Veleno and tapped it in backdoor to make it 6-1 with his 11th.

            “I think we’ve got to be better than what we showed in the third period,” Vancouver defenseman Oliver Ekman-Larsson said. “I thought we were in the game at one point there, 3-1, a shot away to be right back in it. And they came out and they (score), so we have to manage the game a little bit better in the third to kind of hang around a little bit and get our chances. But we couldn’t do that.”

            Detroit was a perfect 1-for-1 with the man advantage while Vancouver went 0-for-4.

            MSU SHOOTING REACTION

            Larkin said he and his teammates learned about the fatal shooting at Michigan State University as they walked back into the locker room after the game.

            “We’re all just pretty, pretty devastated by it and our thoughts and prayers go out to everyone involved, all the students, all the families,” he said, his voice breaking. “Just very sad … and it just hurts the heart and we feel for everyone involved.

            “I know tonight was a win but it’s kind of hard to talk about anything else. We’re all thinking about our home state right now.”

Haguida said the exchanges between young politicians in both countries have been beneficial to strengthening democracy in the region, per CNA.Hagiuda’s welcoming comments also included gratitude for condolences sent by the people of Taiwan after the assassination of former Prime Minister Abe Shinzo last year. Hagiuda also addressed the rise of China and the resulting instability in East Asia, making exchanges between countries with shared values even more important than ever.CYC Director Ger Yeong-kuang (葛永光) discussed a visit by former Taiwan president and CYC founder, Chiang Ching-kuo (蔣經國), who in 1967 met with LDP Youth Division Director Eisaku Satō. During the visit, both sides decided to strengthen youth exchanges between the two countries. Later, Eisaku Sato would go on to become Japan’s Prime Minister.Ger went on to say that in the past few years, regardless of international developments, the CYC continues to maintain exchanges and strong connections with the LDP’s Youth Division, per CNA.China Youth Corps delegation of young politicians travel to meet Japan's LDP Youth Division (CNA photo)“The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the world and interpersonal relationships in the past few years, but during this time, we have also seen the precious nature of friendship and the need to help each other. Taiwan was panicked due to lack of vaccines at the beginning of the epidemic and we are very grateful the Japanese government sent vaccines to Taiwan,” said Ger.Ger went on to add that the pandemic changed the world, and cross-strait peace is an issue that not only affects the security of East Asia but also the world. Due to cross-strait tensions, Taiwan has closer relations with Japan and the U.S.“The people of Taiwan hope for peace. The Russian-Ukraine war has made everyone see the true horror of war. Nobody wants war, but we must also prepare for what to do if war comes,” said Ger.KMT legislator Chen I-hsin (陳以信), one of the members of the CYC delegation, said his participation in this trip has helped the Legislative Yuan’s foreign diplomacy. He noted meeting a number of Japanese politicians from both ruling and opposition parties.Chen also made it known that the KMT will also send a high-level delegation to visit Japan in the near future, hoping to closely connect with the Japanese political parties to strengthen friendly relations between Taiwan and Japan.",2023/02/14,509,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809739,"Kenya seeks divine help to end crippling, ongoing drought","NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — With the prospect of a sixth consecutive failed rainy season in the east and Horn of Africa, Kenya's president is hoping the heavens will finally open with the help of a national day of mass prayer on Tuesday.

            
                William Ruto announced the plans for the country's first ever day of prayer on Sunday at a service in the drought-stricken city of Nakuru, some 100 miles (160 kilometers) from the capital Nairobi. It follows a joint call by the country's spiritual leaders to dedicate an entire day to prayer to ease drought conditions in the nation.

            Ruto’s own ambitious economic revival strategy for the country is also dependent on a successful rainy season.











            “As a government we have set out elaborate plans for food security, we have seeds, ample fertilizer, and water harvesting strategies including dams. We now need God to send us the rain,” Ruto said. “I urge all people from all faiths ... to pray for our country.""

            Kenya and other east African nations have been experiencing some of the worst drought conditions in decades, causing crop failure, loss of livestock, wildlife and biodiversity, and malnutrition. Domestic agriculture is a large part of Kenya's economy.

            The U.N. humanitarian agency has termed the ongoing drought in the region a “rapidly unfolding humanitarian catastrophe.”

            Meteorologists say human-caused climate change has been exacerbating the extreme conditions.

            “It is time we started including climate change as factor in our development plans,"" Evans Mukolwe, former director of the Kenyan and U.N. weather agencies, told The Associated Press. ""The current drought which we warned about some years ago has wider ramifications on the social economic conditions of the region including peace, security, and political stability.”

            Mukolwe added that climate change has contributed to below average rainy seasons in the region for about three decades. 

            The Intergovernmental Authority on Development's climate center said that since 2020, five rainy seasons have failed, affecting over 50 million people. The center will release its projections for the long rains season, typically from March to May, later in February. Early projections from other meteorological groups are not optimistic.

            Around the world people from different faiths have often sought divine intervention for rain or other favorable weather. Last summer Milan's Archbishop made a pilgrimage to three churches in hopes of ending the country's dry spell and Utah's governor called for citizens to pray for rain ahead of a weekend of extreme heat.

            Some Kenyans intend to heed the president’s call.

            Nairobi business owner Millicent Nyambura said she supported the idea, “even though it will affect my colleagues in the flower business who expect to boost sales on Valentine's Day.”

""The current drought which we warned about some years ago has wider ramifications on the social economic conditions of the region including peace, security, and political stability.”Mukolwe added that climate change has contributed to below average rainy seasons in the region for about three decades.The Intergovernmental Authority on Development's climate center said that since 2020, five rainy seasons have failed, affecting over 50 million people. The center will release its projections for the long rains season, typically from March to May, later in February. Early projections from other meteorological groups are not optimistic.Around the world people from different faiths have often sought divine intervention for rain or other favorable weather. Last summer Milan's Archbishop made a pilgrimage to three churches in hopes of ending the country's dry spell and Utah's governor called for citizens to pray for rain ahead of a weekend of extreme heat.Some Kenyans intend to heed the president’s call.Nairobi business owner Millicent Nyambura said she supported the idea, “even though it will affect my colleagues in the flower business who expect to boost sales on Valentine's Day.”___Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809740,Idris Elba on James Bond: 'I'm not going to be that guy',"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Actor Idris Elba says he's going to stick with being the tormented detective John Luther — not James Bond. 

            Speaking Tuesday to the World Government Summit in Dubai, Elba brought up the persistent discussions about him taking over as Ian Fleming's famed British spy. Those had grown louder after Daniel Craig's demise as Bond in the 25th film in the franchise called “No Time to Die.”

            Asked about his upcoming film based on the British series “Luther,” Elba clearly took himself out of playing 007. 











            “It's very dark,"" Elba said of the series. “We've been working on the television show for about 10 years and so the natural ambition is to take it to the big screen, and so we're here with the first movie.” 

            He added: “You know, a lot of people talk about another character that begins with ‘J’ and ends with ‘B,' but I'm not going to be that guy. I'm going to be John Luther. That's who I am.” 

            “Luther: The Fallen Sun” is due to come out in American theaters on Feb. 24, then stream on Netflix beginning March 10. It also co-stars Andy Serkis and other actors from the television series. 

            Elba, 50, is known for a variety of television and film roles, ranging from Stringer Bell on the American television series “The Wire"" and the recent movie “Beast.” 

            While on stage, Elba discussed an upcoming film he's working on with the American actor and wrestler John Cena called “The Heads of State.”

            “He plays the American president. I play the British prime minister,” Elba said. “We get into a caper. I'm very excited about doing that because leadership comes in many different forms.” 

            In recent weeks, Elba has appeared at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where he and his wife Sabrina Dhowre Elba received an award for their work on food security in Africa. Elba also has worked as an anti-crime ambassador with his “Don’t Stab Your Future” initiative in the United Kingdom, where he grew up in east London.

            During his talk, Elba urged nations to invest more in creative industries, saying it can provide an economic engine that provides jobs to their youth. In particular, he said creative jobs could greatly help countries in Africa. 

            “I believe that Africa, especially as a continent, needs to hold a narrative, change a narrative,” he said. 

            Discussing storytelling, Elba also praised Dubai for its “incredible tourism story” that it has developed over the last decades. The city-state is seeing a new real estate boom, fueled in part by Russian cash amid Moscow's war on Ukraine. 

            “I think Dubai should win an Oscar because the (place) is incredible,” Elba said to applause. “It's a very, very good job and other countries should take note.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809761,Some Ukrainian soldiers freeze sperm amid war with Russia,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — As Vitalii Khroniuk lay facedown on the ground taking cover from Russian artillery fire, the Ukrainian solider had just one regret: He had never had a child.

            Aware that he could die at any moment, the 29-year-old decided to try cryopreservation — the process of freezing sperm or eggs that some Ukrainian soldiers are turning to as they face the possibility that they might never go home.

            “It’s not scary to die, but it’s scary when you don’t leave anyone behind,” said Khroniuk, who had quickly joined the war effort, without a thought about his future, when Russia invaded Ukraine nearly a year ago.











            During a vacation home in January, he and his partner went to a private clinic in Kyiv, IVMED, that is waiving the $55 cost of cryopreservation for soldiers. The clinic has had about 100 soldiers freeze sperm since the invasion, says its chief doctor, Halyna Strelko. Assisted conception services to get pregnant currently cost $800 to $3,500.

            “We don’t know how else to help. We can only make children or help make them. We don’t have weapons, we can’t fight, but what we do is also important,” said Strelko, whose clinic had to close during the first months of the war as Kyiv was under attack but reopened after the Russian military retreated from the area.

            When Khroniuk told his partner, Anna Sokurenko, 24, what he wanted to do, she initially was unsure.

            “It was very painful to realize that there is a possibility that he will not return,” said Sokurenko, adding that it took her a night of reflection to agree.

            She and Khroniuk spoke to The Associated Press while sitting at the clinic, where posters of smiling babies, including one that reads, “Your future is securely protected,” hang in the corridor. The clinic’s lab has its own backup power supply that kicks in during frequent outages from Russian missile strikes damaging the electric infrastructure. 

            Dr. Strelko, who has been in the fertility business since 1998, said the service she is offering soldiers is particularly important now, pointing to ""a very aggressive part of this war with massive losses.”

            Russian forces have been pushing their advance on the eastern city of Bakhmut with heavy shelling and attacks that are believed to have produced massive troop losses for both Ukraine and Russia. Neither side is saying how many have died. 

            Sokurenko and Khroniuk married a few days after their clinic visit, and he is now fighting in the Chernihiv region near the border. She believes that a chance to have a child, even after a partner is killed at war, could smooth the deep pain of loss.

            “I think it’s a very important opportunity in the future if a woman loses her loved one,"" she said. “I understand that it will be difficult to recover from this, but it will give the sense to continue to fight, to continue to live.""

            Nataliia Kyrkach-Antonenko, 37, got pregnant while visiting her husband in a front-line town a few months before he was killed in battle. Her husband, Vitalii, came home to Kyiv for a short vacation 10 days before his November death and got to see an ultrasound of his unborn baby girl. He also visited a fertility clinic to freeze his sperm.

            Kyrkach-Antonenko hopes to eventually have another child using that sperm. She said being able to have her late husband’s children “is an incredible support.”

            “We have loved each other incredibly strong for 18 years,” she said.

            She also sees cryopreservation as a fight for the country's future. 

            “Their dads did everything possible to make this future happen. Now it is our turn, as women, to fight for the future of Ukraine as well, raising people with dignity. People who can continue to change the country for the better,” she said.

            Another couple who went to the IVMED clinic in December, Oles and Iryna, asked that only their first names be used because of privacy concerns. 

            Oles is in the Donetsk region, where some cities were turned into hellscapes due to fierce battles over the past months, and sees cryopreservation as an assurance. 

            Iryna spends her nights alone in their apartment on the outskirts of Kyiv, tossing between anxiety for her husband as he fights on the most intensive and deadly part of the eastern frontline and the numerous visits to the clinic where she is trying to get pregnant.

            “Yes, it is a difficult life, with worries, bombardment, with constant anxiety for relatives. But at the same time, it is what it is,” she says. “It’s better to be a parent now than to put it off until you can no longer have children.""

            “Family is what will hold our country, and children are our future,"" she said. “We fight for them.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809762,Rising toll makes quake deadliest in Turkey's modern history,"ANTAKYA, Turkey (AP) — Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced Tuesday that more than 35,000 people have died in Turkey as a result of last week’s earthquake, making it the deadliest such disaster since the country’s founding 100 years ago.

            While the death toll is almost certain to rise even further, many of the tens of thousands of survivors left homeless were still struggling to meet basic needs, like finding shelter from the bitter cold.

            Confirmed deaths in Turkey passed those recorded from the massive Erzincan earthquake in 1939 that killed around 33,000 people.











            Erdogan said 105,505 were injured as a result of the Feb. 6 quake centered around Kahramanmaras and its aftershocks. Almost 3,700 deaths have been confirmed in neighboring Syria, taking the combined toll in both countries to over 39,000.

            The Turkish president, who has referred to the quake as “the disaster of the century,” said more than 13,000 people were still being treated in hospital.

            Speaking in Ankara following a five-hour Cabinet meeting held at the headquarters of disaster agency AFAD, Erdogan said 47,000 buildings, which contained 211,000 residences, had been destroyed or were so badly damaged as to require demolition.

            “We will continue our work until we get our last citizen out of the destroyed buildings,” Erdogan said of ongoing rescue efforts.

            Aid agencies and governments were stepping up efforts to bring help to devastated parts of Turkey and Syria.

            The situation was particularly desperate in Syria, where a 12-year civil war has complicated relief efforts and meant days of wrangling over how to even move aid into the country, let alone distribute it. Some people there said they have received nothing. In Turkey, meanwhile, families huddled in train cars.

            The Syrian Health Ministry announced a final count of 1,414 deaths and 1,357 injuries in areas under government control.

            On Tuesday, the United Nations launched a $397 million appeal to provide “desperately needed, life-saving relief for nearly 5 million Syrians” for three months. It came a day after the global body announced a deal with Damascus to deliver U.N. aid through two more border crossings from Turkey to rebel-held areas of northwest Syria — but the needs remained enormous.

            Ahmed Ismail Suleiman set up a shelter of blankets outside his damaged house in the town of Jinderis, one of the worst-hit communities in northwest Syria. He was afraid to move his family back into a house that might not be structurally sound, so 18 people slept outside under the makeshift tent.

            “We sit but can’t sleep lying down here,"" he said. “We are waiting for a proper tent.”

            Mahmoud Haffar, head of the town council, said residents have been able to scrounge up about 2,500 tents so far, but some 1,500 families still remain without shelter — as nighttime temperatures fall to around minus 4 degrees Celsius (26 degrees Fahrenheit).

            “We are ... still hearing the question of when will aid get in,” said Haffar.

            While tents have been in short supply, one women said the town had a surplus of donated bread and water.

            To the southwest, in government-held Latakia, Raeefa Breemo said only those packing into shelters seemed to be getting aid.

            “We need to eat, we need to drink, we need to survive. Our jobs, our lives, everything have stopped,"" Breemo said.

            Offers of help — from rescue crews and doctors to generators and food — have come from around the world, but the needs remain immense after the magnitude 7.8 quake and powerful aftershocks toppled or damaged tens of thousands of buildings, destroyed roads and closed airports for a time. The quake affected 10 provinces in Turkey that are home to some 13.5 million people, as well as a large area in northwest Syria that is home to millions.

            Much of the water system in the quake-hit region was not working, and Turkey’s health minister said samples from dozens of points of the system showed the water was unsuitable to drink.

            In the Turkish port city of Iskenderun, displaced families have sheltered in train carriages since last week.

            While many have left in recent days for nearby camps or other parts of Turkey, dozens of people were still living in the trains on Tuesday.

            “The wagons have become our home,” 50-year-old Nida Karahan told Anadolu Agency. 

            While a first Saudi aid plane, carrying 35 tons of food, landed in Syrian government-held Aleppo on Tuesday, getting aid to the country's rebel-held Idlib has been especially complicated.

            Until Monday’s deal between the U.N. and the Syrian government of President Bashar Assad, the global body had only been allowed to deliver aid to the area through a single border crossing with Turkey, or via government territory.

            The newly opened crossings at Bab al-Salam and Al Raée are to function for an initial period of three months. Russia bristled at suggestions that the opening of the crossings might be made permanent, and its Foreign Ministry accused the West of trying to get aid “exclusively” to areas not controlled by the Syrian government.

            Major humanitarian organizations welcomed the development but cautioned that logistical problems remain, even as the first U.N. aid convoy with 11 trucks entered northwestern Syria through Bab al-Salam Tuesday.

            “This is a constant back and forth in negotiations,” said World Health Organization spokesman Christian Lindmeier. “Every party has to agree to receive convoys.”

            The death toll in both countries is nearly certain to rise as search teams turn up more bodies — and the window for finding survivors was closing.

            Nevertheless, more than 200 hours after the quake struck, teacher Emine Akgul was pulled from an apartment building in Antakya by a mining search and rescue team, Turkey's state-run Anadolu news agency reported.

            In Adiyaman province, rescuers reached 18-year-old Muhammed Cafer Cetin, and medics gave him an IV with fluids before attempting a dangerous extraction from a building that crumbled further as rescuers were working. Medics fitted him with a neck brace and he was carted away on a stretcher with an oxygen mask, Turkish TV showed. 

            Many in Turkey have blamed faulty construction for the vast devastation, and authorities continued targeting contractors allegedly linked with buildings that collapsed. Turkey has introduced construction codes that meet earthquake-engineering standards, but experts say the codes are rarely enforced.

            Erdogan announced Tuesday that the government planned to start construction of 30,000 houses in March.

            “Our aim is to complete the construction of high quality and safe buildings in a year to meet the housing need in the entire earthquake zone,” he said.

            At a temporary shelter in a sports center in Afrin in northwest Syria, 190 families were sleeping on the floor of a basketball court, lying on mats typically used for training. The families attempted to create a semblance of privacy by hanging blankets on columns or sports bars.

            Sabah el Khodr said she and her two toddlers have been sick for the last nine days. The children were wrapped in blankets and sleeping on the floor of the court.

            Local officials said the shelter is temporary, until new tents are secured.

He was afraid to move his family back into a house that might not be structurally sound, so 18 people slept outside under the makeshift tent.“We sit but can’t sleep lying down here,"" he said. “We are waiting for a proper tent.”Mahmoud Haffar, head of the town council, said residents have been able to scrounge up about 2,500 tents so far, but some 1,500 families still remain without shelter — as nighttime temperatures fall to around minus 4 degrees Celsius (26 degrees Fahrenheit).“We are ... still hearing the question of when will aid get in,” said Haffar.While tents have been in short supply, one women said the town had a surplus of donated bread and water.To the southwest, in government-held Latakia, Raeefa Breemo said only those packing into shelters seemed to be getting aid.“We need to eat, we need to drink, we need to survive. Our jobs, our lives, everything have stopped,"" Breemo said.Offers of help — from rescue crews and doctors to generators and food — have come from around the world, but the needs remain immense after the magnitude 7.8 quake and powerful aftershocks toppled or damaged tens of thousands of buildings, destroyed roads and closed airports for a time. The quake affected 10 provinces in Turkey that are home to some 13.5 million people, as well as a large area in northwest Syria that is home to millions.Much of the water system in the quake-hit region was not working, and Turkey’s health minister said samples from dozens of points of the system showed the water was unsuitable to drink.In the Turkish port city of Iskenderun, displaced families have sheltered in train carriages since last week.While many have left in recent days for nearby camps or other parts of Turkey, dozens of people were still living in the trains on Tuesday.“The wagons have become our home,” 50-year-old Nida Karahan told Anadolu Agency.While a first Saudi aid plane, carrying 35 tons of food, landed in Syrian government-held Aleppo on Tuesday, getting aid to the country's rebel-held Idlib has been especially complicated.Until Monday’s deal between the U.N. and the Syrian government of President Bashar Assad, the global body had only been allowed to deliver aid to the area through a single border crossing with Turkey, or via government territory.The newly opened crossings at Bab al-Salam and Al Raée are to function for an initial period of three months. Russia bristled at suggestions that the opening of the crossings might be made permanent, and its Foreign Ministry accused the West of trying to get aid “exclusively” to areas not controlled by the Syrian government.Major humanitarian organizations welcomed the development but cautioned that logistical problems remain, even as the first U.N. aid convoy with 11 trucks entered northwestern Syria through Bab al-Salam Tuesday.“This is a constant back and forth in negotiations,” said World Health Organization spokesman Christian Lindmeier. “Every party has to agree to receive convoys.”The death toll in both countries is nearly certain to rise as search teams turn up more bodies — and the window for finding survivors was closing.Nevertheless, more than 200 hours after the quake struck, teacher Emine Akgul was pulled from an apartment building in Antakya by a mining search and rescue team, Turkey's state-run Anadolu news agency reported.In Adiyaman province, rescuers reached 18-year-old Muhammed Cafer Cetin, and medics gave him an IV with fluids before attempting a dangerous extraction from a building that crumbled further as rescuers were working. Medics fitted him with a neck brace and he was carted away on a stretcher with an oxygen mask, Turkish TV showed.Many in Turkey have blamed faulty construction for the vast devastation, and authorities continued targeting contractors allegedly linked with buildings that collapsed. Turkey has introduced construction codes that meet earthquake-engineering standards, but experts say the codes are rarely enforced.Erdogan announced Tuesday that the government planned to start construction of 30,000 houses in March.“Our aim is to complete the construction of high quality and safe buildings in a year to meet the housing need in the entire earthquake zone,” he said.At a temporary shelter in a sports center in Afrin in northwest Syria, 190 families were sleeping on the floor of a basketball court, lying on mats typically used for training. The families attempted to create a semblance of privacy by hanging blankets on columns or sports bars.Sabah el Khodr said she and her two toddlers have been sick for the last nine days. The children were wrapped in blankets and sleeping on the floor of the court.Local officials said the shelter is temporary, until new tents are secured.___Bilginsoy and Wilks reported from Istanbul, Armangue from Antakya, Turkey; Abby Sewell and Kareem Chehayeb in Beirut, and Edith M.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809763,"For Syrian women, quake adds disaster on top of war's pain","ATAREB, Syria (AP) — Draped in a heavy wool shawl against the cold, Ayesha dragged her feet, her toddler granddaughter trailing behind her, as they made the 15-minute walk from her tent to the nearest bathroom in a nearby building, the only place they have to wash.

            Seven days after the earthquake leveled their home in the northwest Syrian town of Atareb, the 43-year-old still has no access to water, electricity or heat for her and 12 family members, all crammed into a single tent.

             “When I look at our house, I wonder how did anyone come out alive?” Ayesha said. “Maybe it would have been better if I died,"" she added. ""I came from under that rubble carrying the rubble of the whole world on my shoulders.” 











            She doesn’t know how much more she and other Syrians can take. Women in particular have shouldered the responsibility of keeping shattered families together during the past 12 years of civil war. The conflict and economic collapse left millions of people dependent on international aid. Now added to the litany of hardships is destruction from the earthquake, which killed tens of thousands and left millions homeless in southern Turkey and northern Syria.

            With hospitals swamped by quake victims, Ayesha can’t get medical services to treat and monitor her liver disease. She and her husband both lost their sources of income in the quake. His taxi was crushed, and her stock of clothes that she once sold to neighbors was destroyed. 

            They have nothing to provide for their six children and their five grandchildren, including two she took in after one of her sons was killed in the war. They have to share mattresses to sleep in their tent.

            “If hardships are a sign of the love of God, it means God really loves the Syrian people,” Ayesha said, breaking out in tears. Like most women in this conservative community, she spoke on condition her last name be withheld.

            Their tent is in a camp for quake victims in Atareb, part of the last opposition-held territory in northwest Syria, which has seen bombardment and fighting for years. Walking between rows of destroyed homes in the town, it is hard to distinguish which collapsed from the quake and which from intense military operations at the height of fighting.

            Syria’s war has loaded a particular burden and isolation on women, with so many men who were killed, detained, maimed or forced out of the country. The number of female-headed households across Syria increased by around 80% to comprise more than a fifth of households in 2020, according to the U.N. 

            Even before the quake, over 7 million women and girls across Syria needed critical health services and support against physical and sexual violence. Child marriage was on the rise, and hundreds of thousands of girls were out of school. 

            The immediate impact of the earthquake put at least 350,000 pregnancies in Syria and Turkey at risk, according to U.N. figures. 

            Women in the opposition-held northwest are especially vulnerable. Most of the territory’s population of 4 million fled there after being displaced from other parts of Syria. Health care was already stretched thin and dependent on foreign aid. Now non-emergency medical services have been suspended to deal with the earthquake. 

            “We can treat the women after trauma or after delivery, but they need to go back to a safe environment with minimum housing, nutrition and clean water. Unfortunately, this is in general lacking in northwest,” said Basel Termanini, chairman of the Syrian American Medical Society which has dozens of facilities in the northwest. 

            Throughout the war, Ayesha and her family repeatedly fled from their home in Atareb during times of bombardment to safer areas, where they would stay for months until they could return. One of her sons was killed in 2019, and she’s been taking care of his two young children since. 

            But, she said, “in 12 years of war, we never tasted terror and pain like that night” of the earthquake. 

            When the quake hit before dawn on Feb. 6, Ayesha and her family managed to get out of her building as part of it collapsed. They stood in the cold, pouring rain, looking at the destruction in disbelief.

            The building next door was completely flattened, killing many of those inside -- including a woman who had just given birth, the baby, her seven other kids and her mother, who had arrived just hours earlier to help with the newborn. 

            The building’s dead now lie in a mass grave on the far end of a neighboring piece of farmland. The owner of the plot donated the land because cemeteries have filled up with quake victims. 

            Things were already hard before the earthquake. In the opposition-held territory, 90% of the population is dependent on humanitarian assistance.

            There has been no work for the men, and many of the men were handicapped in the war, she said. Some women find jobs in community service and with aid groups. Others do household crafts like making soap or sewing clothes. There are hundreds of female civil defense volunteers, many of whom participated for the first time in the rescue and search missions. 

            But in the largely conservative community, dominated by a group once affiliated with al-Qaida, jobs for women are not easy to come by.

            Halima, a 30-year-old mother of two children, lost her husband in the early days of the war. For years, she has moved between shelters for the displaced in the northwest in search of more generous donated food baskets. The quake caused cracks in the place where she’s currently staying and she’s afraid to stay there but has nowhere else to go.

            “I pray for God’s grace. Maybe someone can take care of my children,” she said Sunday as she picked donated clothes at a Turkish Red Crescent warehouse.

            International aid has only trickled in for quake victims in the northwest, increasing anger at the United Nations. 

            The sentiment has been building for some time. Humanitarian aid to Syria, locked in one of the world’s most complex crises for years, has been among the best funded by donors. But the gap between funding and need has grown, and U.N. appeals for emergency responses have gone more than 50% unanswered. In 2021, the health sector in northwest Syria was 60% underfunded, with only $6.4 million of $23.3 million covered. 

            When the earthquake hit, hospitals were not only damaged by the tremors but also overwhelmed by the injured and casualties, with supplies of essential emergency kits running out. Maternity hospitals were flooded with early deliveries and complications in pregnancies. 

            “Mothers are still living in the streets,” said Ikram Haboush, director of the maternity hospital in Atareb. “We don’t have enough incubators for early deliveries. The situation is far from stable.”

            Over the years of conflict, Syrian women have exhausted their coping strategies. A natural disaster is the last thing they were prepared for. 

            “We are tired,” said Ayesha. 

            “For 12 years, we didn’t sleep a night from fear of bombings, from air strikes, or from displacement. Now we have eternal displacement,” she said. “We are living the tragedy of all tragedies.”ATAREB, Syria (AP) — Draped in a heavy wool shawl against the cold, Ayesha dragged her feet, her toddler granddaughter trailing behind her, as they made the 15-minute walk from her tent to the nearest bathroom in a nearby building, the only place they have to wash.Seven days after the earthquake leveled their home in the northwest Syrian town of Atareb, the 43-year-old still has no access to water, electricity or heat for her and 12 family members, all crammed into a single tent.“When I look at our house, I wonder how did anyone come out alive?” Ayesha said. “Maybe it would have been better if I died,"" she added.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809764,"AP PHOTOS: In Ukraine, searing images capture a year of war","Russia’s invasion of Ukraine a year ago brought death, destruction and hardship to the country, and awakened fears of a new Cold War.

            The Feb. 24 attack resulted in more than 8 million Ukrainians fleeing their country in what was the greatest exodus of refugees Europe has witnessed since World War II.

            Moscow’s war machine has bombarded civilian infrastructure. Missiles, rockets and artillery shells have indiscriminately hit homes, hospitals and other public buildings, killing and wounding thousands.











            In some areas, the ruins of apartment buildings and crumbled bridges are now the prominent features of Ukraine's new war-ravaged landscape. Bodies lie in the streets, in gardens, in houses. Fire-gutted cars and armored vehicles dot the roads.

            In Bucha, northwest of Kyiv, where hundreds of civilians were found dead after a Russian withdrawal from the city last March, Ukrainian officials allege atrocities. Some corpses had their hands tied. Mass graves have been found. 

            In Mariupol, attacks on hospitals, schools, residential areas and other civilian structures and sites protected under international humanitarian law became the norm. 

            Ukrainians are often confined for hours in makeshift bomb shelters. Many have been in dire need of food and other aid.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809765,Asian stocks fall after US inflation feeds rate hike fears,"BEIJING (AP) — Asian stock markets fell Wednesday after U.S. inflation edged down less than expected, fueling concern the Federal Reserve might think more interest rate hikes are needed.

            Market benchmarks in Tokyo, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Sydney declined. Oil prices retreated.

            Wall Street ended mixed Tuesday after inflation slowed to 6.4% in January from the previous month’s 6.5%. That was down from June’s three-decade high of 9.1% but hotter than the consensus expectation of 6.2%.











            Core inflation, which strips out more volatile food and energy prices to give a clearer view of the trend, rose to 0.4% over a month earlier from December’s 0.3%.

            “Disinflation trends are in danger, which could prompt the Fed to both deliver more rate hikes and for them to stay higher for longer,” said Edward Moya of Oanda in a report.

            The Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.3% to 3,283.19 and the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo gave up 0.4% to 27,491.51. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong tumbled 1.4% to 20,806.24.

            The Kospi in Seoul retreated 1.1% to 2,438.28 and Sydney's S&P-ASX 200 sank 1.2% to 7,345.70.

            New Zealand and Southeast Asian markets also declined.

            Stock prices have swung between gains and losses over the past year as traders try to figure out how far the Fed and other central banks will go to extinguish surging inflation. Some worry central bankers might be willing to tip the global economy into a recession.

            Traders expect two more U.S. rate hikes of 0.25 percentage points this year to slow business activity and hiring. Some expect cuts to start as soon the end of this year despite comments by Chair Jerome Powell and other Fed officials that borrowing costs might have to stay elevated for an extended period to get inflation to their 2% target.

            On Wall Street, the benchmark S&P 500 index edged down less than 0.1% to 4,136.13. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.5% to 34,089.27 while the Nasdaq gained 0.6% to 11,960.15.

            The Fed's benchmark lending rate stands at 4.50% to 4.75%, up from close to zero a year ago.

            Investors have been raising their forecasts for how high the Fed will take rates by the summer, and they’re now betting on a 19.2% probability that its key rate will top 5.5% in July. That’s up from just a 0.2% probability seen a month ago, according to CME Group. 

            The market’s expectations for the Fed have been driving yields higher in the bond market in particular. The two-year Treasury has shot to its highest level since November, egged on last week by a stronger-than-expected report on the U.S. jobs market.

            The two-year yield rose to 4.61% from 4.52% late Monday. It initially zig-zagged up, down and back again after the release of the inflation report. 

            The 10-year yield, which helps set rates for mortgages and other loans, rose to 3.75% from 3.70%.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809779,Make-up school days are bad for kids' development: Expert,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwan is already facing down the third make-up work and school day of the year, set for Feb. 18, amid growing opposition to the system, including from a prominent Taiwanese childcare expert.Wang Hung Che (王宏哲) is the author of over 20 parental advice and children’s books, and took to Facebook on Monday (Feb. 14) to say that the make-up days were bad for kids' learning and family dynamics. “Make-up classes will only make children’s learning worse,” he said.Wang said that the make-up classes deprive children of the chance to do physical activities, and make them more distracted the following week. “Rest and activities on the weekends stimulate kids’ memory and concentration, which improves learning,” he said.Joint U.K.-Canadian research from 2023 supports this, finding that students who are generally satisfied with their choices in learning and their ability to rest do better overall than those who aren’t.Wang also said that the make-up days allow parents to bond with their children, something that is already a challenge given many Taiwanese people's busy schedules. “Both kids and adults build up stress during the week, and you really need to take two days off to reset,” he said.The impending make-up work and class day is to bridge the gap between Feb. 26 (a Sunday) and Feb.28, a national public holiday held to mark the 228 Peace Memorial Day. There are six make-up work and class days throughout 2023, with two of them falling in February.",2023/02/14,4698,Society

The inmate was granted leave to visit relatives but failed to return to the prison.The escaped inmate, 27-year-old Lu Tsung-lung (魯宗龍), was sentenced to two years and eight months in prison by the Fuchien High Court Kinmen Branch Court for fraud and theft, reported ETtoday. However, because his household registration is in Hualien County, Lu was sent to the Hualien Zihciang Minimum-Security Prison to serve his sentence.Recently, Lu applied for permission to travel to his hometown in Kinmen County to visit his relatives on Saturday (Feb. 11). He was originally supposed to return to the prison at 8 p.m. on Monday (Feb. 13), but his flight was delayed due to fog.He took a later flight at 5 p.m. and arrived at Songshan Airport at 7 p.m. At the airport, he notified the prison that he would return to the prison facility and would go to Nangang Train Station to purchase a ticket to go back to Hualien.However, Lu never appeared that evening and prison staff contacted his family members, who claimed they were unaware of his whereabouts. The Ministry of Justice notified the CIB to issue a special warrant for his arrest.The killing of two police officers by an escapee from Mingde Minimum Security Prison in Tainan City shocked the public last year. Therefore, the CIB advised police officers to take precautions to ensure their own safety when searching for the inmate.Police then began reviewing surveillance camera footage and saw him getting off a plane at Songshan Airport and buying tickets at Nangang Station. Instead of buying a ticket to Hualien, Lu appeared to purchase a ticket to New Taipei City's Xizhi District.At 3 p.m. on Tuesday afternoon, police were able to pinpoint Lu's location to an internet cafe in Xizhi, reported UDN. Police arrested him on the spot and are escorting him back to Hualien.Lu had been allowed to go out on leave five times and had less than one year left on his sentence. He applied for parole in November last year, but was denied.His escape may affect his chances of being released from prison on parole in the future.",2023/02/14,2022,Society
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809788,"Love blossoms in Serbia between Ukrainian, Russian 'enemies'","BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — She is from Ukraine and he is from Russia. Their love blossomed online, but with their nations at war, the odds of carrying on their relationship were stacked against them. Even so, it didn't take long for the young couple to beat the odds.

            Mariia Vyhivska and Iurii Kurochkin, now both 23, fell in love while playing an online video game. But Russia's invasion of its neighbor threatened to scuttle their relationship before it even got off the ground. They boldly turned their backs on the war-engendered enmity pervading their homelands and chose to be together.

            Vyhivska was living in Zvyagel, near Ukraine's capital Kyiv, and Kurochkin in St. Petersburg in Russia. Despite the seemingly insurmountable distance, the couple didn't give up.











            “It wasn't hard,” said Vyhivska, smiling. “I wasn't afraid, not at all. I am happy. Because I am loved.”

            Kurochkin recalled how the couple started making plans to meet in person. 

            “It was a year ago ... I started to organize my international passport, to visit Mariia in Ukraine."" recalled Kurochkin. ""I finished it in January, and as you know, the war started in February and it crashed all our plans.”

            It seemed that all hope of meeting evaporated amid the Russian onslaught in Ukraine that drew global condemnation and saw millions of Ukrainian refugees stream out of the country. 

            Vyhivska and Kurochkin were at a loss. She moved to Czechia soon after the war started while he stayed at home in Russia. But they didn't give up. They started sizing up “some options to live together,"" said Kurochkin.

            The answer turned out to be Serbia, a fellow-Slavic nation in the Balkans that remained friendly with Russia, and where Russians could enter without a visa. Serbia's capital Belgrade was where Vyhivska and Kurochkin met for the first time.

            “I arrived to Serbia on 27th of April and I waited for her for several days,” he said. “She arrived from the Czech Republic and we met each other at the central bus station.""

            He was all that she imagined, said Vyhivska.

            “There was this moment of unbelievable joy,” she said. “I traveled for 16 hours and had no sleep, I couldn't sleep. So, I came out of the bus and I fell into his arms.”

            Their new life together began in that instant. A hostel served as their first abode before the couple found a small flat in a Belgrade suburb. They took up various jobs while pursing IT studies online at a St. Petersburg university. 

            Life together hasn't been without its problems. Last July pro-Russian extremists in Serbia drew a huge Z sign — a symbol of Russia’s invasion — on their building and assailants broke into their flat. They were also attacked by a group of hooligans, Kurochkin said.

            An estimated 200,000 Russians and some 20,000 Ukrainians have come to Serbia in the past year. Many Russians set up businesses in the Balkan country, which has refused to join Western sanctions against Russia despite seeking European Union membership.

            “We talk about the war sometimes but we don’t have any problems between each other,” said Kurochkin. “With other people, of course (we have), because there are a lot of people, there are a lot of points of view, so it is impossible to handle them all.”

            For Vyhivska, the biggest concern has been how she'll be perceived by fellow Ukrainians because of her relationship, even through own family has no objections at all.

            “What happens next? We'll see,” she said. “We don't know what happens tomorrow, there is danger even of nuclear war, they are frightening us with that now. I can't look too far ahead.”

            Kurochkin said they will just take things as they come: “We are happy because we are together.”

They were dogs, the focus of a parallel rescue effort underway.

            “One of the dogs clung to its owner’s corpse, and it was absolutely a miracle that it was rescued six days later,” said Csenay Tekinbas, a representative of the local HAYTAP animal welfare group.

            “I hope it holds on to life,” Tekinbas said of the dog that finally left its dead owner. “I hope we can give it a new life.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809791,Indian officials search BBC offices after Modi documentary,"NEW DELHI (AP) — India's tax officials searched BBC offices in New Delhi and Mumbai on Tuesday, weeks after it aired a documentary critical of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the U.K., the broadcaster said.

            Rights groups and opposition politicians denounced the move by India's Income Tax Department as an attempt to intimidate the media.

            Britain's publicly funded national broadcaster said it was cooperating fully with authorities and hoped ""to have this situation resolved as soon as possible.” Late in the evening, the BBC said officials were still at the two offices.











            “Many staff have now left the building but some have been asked to remain and are continuing to cooperate with the ongoing inquiries,” it said, adding: “Our output and journalism continues as normal.”

            Indian tax authorities declined to comment.

            The tax department was looking at documents related to the BBC's business operations and its Indian arm, the Press Trust of India news agency reported, citing unidentified sources.

            The Editors Guild of India denounced the move, saying it continues “a trend of using government agencies to intimidate and harass press organizations that are critical of government policies or the ruling establishment.”

            Aakar Patel, chair of Amnesty International India’s Board, said the raids were “a blatant affront to freedom of expression.”

            The Indian authorities are clearly trying to harass and intimidate the BBC over its critical coverage of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party,"" Patel said.

             The investigation is “undemocratic” and “reeks of desperation and shows that the Modi government is scared of criticism,” tweeted K.C. Venugopal, general secretary of the opposition Congress party. “We condemn these intimidation tactics in the harshest terms.” 

            Gaurav Bhatia, a spokesperson for Modi's governing Bharatiya Janata Party, said the BBC should have nothing to fear if it follows Indian laws. But he added that the broadcaster's history is “tainted” and “full of hatred” for India and called it corrupt, without offering any specifics.

            The documentary, “India: The Modi Question,” was broadcast in the U.K. last month, examining the prime minister's role in 2002 anti-Muslim riots in the western state of Gujarat, where he was chief minister at the time. More than 1,000 people were killed in the violence.

            Modi has denied allegations that authorities under his watch allowed and even encouraged the bloodshed, and the Supreme Court said it found no evidence to prosecute him. Last year, the court dismissed a petition filed by a Muslim victim questioning Modi’s exoneration.

            The second portion of the two-part documentary examined “the track record of Narendra Modi’s government following his re-election in 2019,” according to the BBC website.

            The program drew an immediate backlash from India's government, which invoked emergency powers under its information technology laws to block it from being shown in the country. Local authorities scrambled to stop screenings organized at Indian universities, and social media platforms including Twitter and YouTube complied with government requests to remove links to the documentary. 

            Critics and political opponents decried the ban as an assault on press freedom. The BBC said at the time that the documentary was “rigorously researched” and involved a wide range of voices and opinions.

            “We offered the Indian Government a right to reply to the matters raised in the series — it declined to respond,” its statement said.

            India’s Foreign Ministry called the documentary a “propaganda piece designed to push a particularly discredited narrative” that lacked objectivity. 

            Many lawmakers from Modi's party criticized it as an attack on the country's sovereignty. Last week, Hindu right-wing nationalists petitioned the Supreme Court for a complete ban on the BBC. The court dismissed their plea, calling it “absolutely meritless.” 

            Human Rights Watch has said the banning of the documentary reflects a broader crackdown on minorities under the Modi government, which the rights group said has frequently invoked draconian laws to muzzle criticism. In recent years, India’s Muslim minority has been the target of violence from Hindu nationalists emboldened by a prime minister who has said little about such attacks since he was first elected in 2014.

            Press freedom in India has been on a steady decline in recent years. The country fell eight places, to 150 out of 180 countries, in the 2022 Press Freedom Index published by Reporters Without Borders. Media watchdog groups accuse the Modi government of silencing criticism on social media under a sweeping internet law that puts digital platforms including Twitter and Facebook under direct government oversight.

            Some media outlets critical of the government have been subjected to tax searches. 

            Authorities searched the offices of the left-leaning website NewsClick and independent media portal Newslaundry on the same day in 2021. Tax officials also accused the Dainik Bhaskar newspaper of tax evasion in 2021 after it published reports of mass funeral pyres and floating corpses that challenged the government's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2017, the government's investigation bureau said it was probing cases of loan defaults when it raided the offices of New Delhi Television, known for its liberal slant.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809792,"Kempe scores for 3rd straight game, Kings beat Sabres 5-2","LOS ANGELES (AP) — Adrian Kempe scored for the third straight game, Viktor Arvidsson had a goal and two assists, and the Los Angeles Kings beat the Buffalo Sabres 5-2 on Monday night.

            Sean Walker. Arthur Kaliyev and Matt Roy also scored to help the Kings get their second straight win after the All-Star break and bye week. Phillip Danault had three assists and Pheonix Copley made 27 saves.

            “We’re just growing our game to get ready for the end,” Danault said. “I thought we played a solid 60 minutes.”











            Dylan Cozens and Peyton Krebs scored, and Craig Anderson allowed five goals on 28 shots for the Sabres, who have dropped four straight games following a five-game win streak.

            “You got to work your way through it,” Sabres coach Don Granato said. “We have to compete and work, and you saw some time in the third period where that’s how we need to play.”

            The Kings scored four times in the second period, turning the tables after allowing six goals in the third period of a 6-0 loss at Buffalo on Dec. 13.

            Kempe following up his four-goal eruption against Pittsburgh on Saturday by scoring short-handed at 9:20 of the middle period to open the scoring. It was his seventh goal in three games.

            “Goal-scorer gets hot, and just hot stick, and it goes in. I’ve been in those situations before, and it’s nice to be in that kind of groove,” Arvidsson said.

            Kaliyev hammered in a slap shot on a power play with 7:25 left for the 2-0 lead, and the edge on special teams proved to be decisive. Arvidsson poked in the puck after it took an odd bounce off the boards and ended up at Anderson’s feet 5:14 into the third for the Kings' second power-play goal in three opportunities.

            Los Angeles held Buffalo to 1-for-5 on the man-advantage, only buckling when Krebs got a consolation goal with five minutes left in the third.

            “When the five guys jump over the boards, whether it's Danault's unit or (Anze) Kopitar's unit, you have a sense that you have a chance,"" Kings coach Todd McLellan said. “Our penalty kill is starting to get to that point where when it jumps over the boards, you're not holding your breath as much.” 

            Walker and Roy scored 33 seconds apart at the end of the second to make it 4-0 with 46 seconds left and effectively put the game out of reach.

            “Overall, it was 10, 15 minutes of collapse by us that cost us the game,” said Cozens, who broke up Copley’s bid for a second straight shutout with 9:44 left in the game.

            RARE AIR

            Kempe is the third Kings player to score five straight goals for the club, joining Tomas Sandstrom (Nov. 22-24, 1990) and Luc Robitaille (Feb. 4-6, 1992).

            “I touched his stick a little bit to get some luck,” Danault joked. “We need that from him ,and he's stepping up big time.”

            Sandstorm holds the club record with eight goals in a three-game span from Nov. 20-24, 1990. 

            DIDN’T WORK

            The Sabres shuffled their forward combinations coming into the game in hopes of trying to end their skid, having Cozens center the top line between Jeff Skinner and Alex Tuch and putting Tage Thompson with Casey Mittelstadt and Kyle Okposo on the second line.

It was his first three-assist game as a King ... The Kings won their 200th game since Rob Blake took over as general manager following the 2017 season. ...

            AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsLOS ANGELES (AP) — Adrian Kempe scored for the third straight game, Viktor Arvidsson had a goal and two assists, and the Los Angeles Kings beat the Buffalo Sabres 5-2 on Monday night.Sean Walker. Arthur Kaliyev and Matt Roy also scored to help the Kings get their second straight win after the All-Star break and bye week. Phillip Danault had three assists and Pheonix Copley made 27 saves.“We’re just growing our game to get ready for the end,” Danault said. “I thought we played a solid 60 minutes.”Dylan Cozens and Peyton Krebs scored, and Craig Anderson allowed five goals on 28 shots for the Sabres, who have dropped four straight games following a five-game win streak.“You got to work your way through it,” Sabres coach Don Granato said. “We have to compete and work, and you saw some time in the third period where that’s how we need to play.”The Kings scored four times in the second period, turning the tables after allowing six goals in the third period of a 6-0 loss at Buffalo on Dec. 13.Kempe following up his four-goal eruption against Pittsburgh on Saturday by scoring short-handed at 9:20 of the middle period to open the scoring. It was his seventh goal in three games.“Goal-scorer gets hot, and just hot stick, and it goes in. I’ve been in those situations before, and it’s nice to be in that kind of groove,” Arvidsson said.Kaliyev hammered in a slap shot on a power play with 7:25 left for the 2-0 lead, and the edge on special teams proved to be decisive. Arvidsson poked in the puck after it took an odd bounce off the boards and ended up at Anderson’s feet 5:14 into the third for the Kings' second power-play goal in three opportunities.Los Angeles held Buffalo to 1-for-5 on the man-advantage, only buckling when Krebs got a consolation goal with five minutes left in the third.“When the five guys jump over the boards, whether it's Danault's unit or (Anze) Kopitar's unit, you have a sense that you have a chance,"" Kings coach Todd McLellan said. “Our penalty kill is starting to get to that point where when it jumps over the boards, you're not holding your breath as much.”Walker and Roy scored 33 seconds apart at the end of the second to make it 4-0 with 46 seconds left and effectively put the game out of reach.“Overall, it was 10, 15 minutes of collapse by us that cost us the game,” said Cozens, who broke up Copley’s bid for a second straight shutout with 9:44 left in the game.RARE AIRKempe is the third Kings player to score five straight goals for the club, joining Tomas Sandstrom (Nov. 22-24, 1990) and Luc Robitaille (Feb. 4-6, 1992).“I touched his stick a little bit to get some luck,” Danault joked. “We need that from him ,and he's stepping up big time.”Sandstorm holds the club record with eight goals in a three-game span from Nov. 20-24, 1990.DIDN’T WORKThe Sabres shuffled their forward combinations coming into the game in hopes of trying to end their skid, having Cozens center the top line between Jeff Skinner and Alex Tuch and putting Tage Thompson with Casey Mittelstadt and Kyle Okposo on the second line.WORTH NOTINGCopley won his 17th game to set a new career high.

It is projected to grow at 7.2% CAGR during the 2023-2030 forecast period.Apiculture means “honey-collecter” in Latin. Apiculture is an important part of agriculture. It pollinates approximately 100 flowering plants species and accounts for over 30% of the world’s food supply. Apiculture refers to the care and feeding bee colonies in order for them to produce various products, such as honey, propolis and flower pollen.Request for a sample report here: https://market.biz/report/global-apiculture-market-qy/522047/#requestforsampleApiculture can be used in agriculture for many purposes. It can be used to attract pollinators, insecticide, or fungicide. You can make candles, lip balm and other products with it. Apiculture is a natural product made by bees. It is made from honeycomb and protects the honeycomb from the elements.People associate all things natural with good health, while chemicals can cause side effects. These perceptions have led to a rise in demand for natural cosmetic ingredients and additives. Consumer trends will lead to the development of natural cosmetic enhancements that are more environmentally friendly and naturally derived, creating new opportunities.Increased honey adulteration, a decline in beekeepers and beehives are all limiting the apiculture market. A lack of better apiculture equipment and rising honey prices are another market constraint.Honey

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809894,Monday's Sports In Brief,"NFL

            Fox was hoping the matchup of two top teams in the Super Bowl and a close game would lead to a record night.

            Even though Sunday’s game between the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles came down to a field goal with 8 seconds remaining, Fox fell just short of its goal.











            The Chiefs’ rally to defeat the Eagles 38-35 is on pace to become the third most-watched television show in history, with an estimated 113 million people watching, according to preliminary numbers released Monday.

            Fox said the audience estimate includes the broadcasts on Fox and Fox Deportes as well as streaming on Fox and the NFL’s digital sites. The figures are via Nielsen’s Fast National data and Adobe Analytics.

            The 2015 game between New England and Seattle on NBC holds the record at 114,442,000 viewers (not including streaming), followed by Super Bowl 51 in 2017 on Fox between Atlanta and New England (113,668,000).

            COLLEGE BASKETBALL

            NEW YORK (AP) — Alabama is the new No. 1, rising to the top spot in The Associated Press Top 25 men’s college basketball poll for the first time in 20 years.

            Alabama received 38 first-place votes from a 62-person media panel Monday, moving up two spots to leapfrog No. 2 Houston. The Cougars had 22 first-place votes to remain at No. 2 and Purdue, down to No. 3, still had two first-place votes.

            UCLA and Kansas rounded out the top five.

            Alabama is No. 1 for the first time since spending two weeks atop the poll midway through the 2002-03 season. It also is the first school to be No. 1 in the AP football and basketball polls in the same season since Ohio State in 2010-11.

            No. 9 Baylor and No. 18 Creighton made the biggest moves of the week, each gaining five spots. No. 19 Iowa State had the biggest drop, losing eight places.

            NEW YORK (AP) — South Carolina beat a top opponent to remain No. 1 in The Associated Press women’s college basketball poll released Monday and now has a showdown with another one looming this weekend.

            The Gamecocks (23-0) topped then-No. 5 UConn 81-77 on Sunday to remain unbeaten and stay the unanimous choice atop the poll from the 28-member national media panel. After facing Auburn on Thursday, South Carolina will play No. 3 LSU on Sunday in a matchup of the last two unbeatens in Division I women’s college basketball.

            Indiana is making its first appearance ever at No. 2. LSU remained at No. 3 after close wins over Tennessee, Georgia and Texas A&M. UConn moved up one spot to fourth and Iowa was fifth. The Cardinal fell to sixth with Utah, Maryland, Duke and Notre Dame rounding out the top 10. 

            NBA

            DALLAS (AP) — Kyrie Irving scored 26 of his 36 points in the fourth quarter in his home debut for Dallas as he tried to rally the Mavericks from a 26-point deficit, but the Minnesota Timberwolves held on for a 124-121 victory.

            Irving had the highest-scoring fourth quarter of his career. But he made a bad pass after stepping inside the 3-point line on the final possession when Dallas had a chance to tie the game. He had exchanged passes with All-Star teammate Luka Doncic, who finished with 33 points.

            First-time All-Star guard Anthony Edwards scored 32 points and Rudy Gobert had 21 points and 14 rebounds for the Timberwolves, who had their biggest lead at 89-63 midway through the third quarter. 

            PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — Damian Lillard had 40 points, including eight 3-pointers, to lead the Portland Trail Blazers to a 127-115 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers. 

            LeBron James, the NBA’s all-time leading scorer, missed his third straight game for the Lakers with a sore left ankle. He hasn’t played since breaking Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s scoring record last Tuesday in a loss to Oklahoma City. 

            The Blazers led by as many as 27 and made a season-best 23 3-pointers, including a franchise-record 17 in the first half. 

            Anthony Davis had 19 points and 20 rebounds for the Lakers, who have lost four of five. 

            NEW YORK (AP) — Jalen Brunson scored 40 points, Josh Hart added a season-high 27 in his second game with his new team and the New York Knicks snapped a nine-game losing streak against the Brooklyn Nets with a 124-106 victory.

            Julius Randle had 18 points and 10 rebounds for the Knicks, who beat the Nets for the first time in three years. Brooklyn never lost to the Knicks when Kevin Durant or Kyrie Irving played, but they’re both gone now and perhaps so will be the Nets’ ownership of New York’s basketball rivalry.

            More importantly for the seventh-place Knicks, they pulled within two games of the Nets for fifth place in the Eastern Conference. The top six teams are guaranteed playoff spots.

            Spencer Dinwiddie scored 28 points for the Nets. 

            BASEBALL

            NEW YORK (AP) — Starting extra innings with a runner on second base during the regular season was made a permanent rules change by Major League Baseball after three seasons of use during the coronavirus pandemic.

            Known by some as the “Ghost Runner” and by others as the “Manfred Man” after baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred, the rule was unanimously adopted by the sport’s 11-person competition committee.

            Use of position players as pitchers also was tightened by the committee. They will be limited to extra innings, when a player’s team is losing by eight or more runs or is winning by 10 or more runs in the ninth inning. Last year, a position player could pitch only in extra innings or if his team was losing or winning by six or more runs.

            There were 216 extra-inning games last year, down from 233 in 2021. The longest last year was Cleveland’s 7-6, 15-inning win over Minnesota in the second game of a doubleheader on Sept. 17. That was one inning shy of the longest in the three seasons of the rule, the Los Angeles Dodgers’ 16-inning win at San Diego on Aug. 25, 2021.

            WASHINGTON (AP) — Ted Lerner, the billionaire real estate developer whose family bought the Washington Nationals in 2006, has died, the team announced Monday. He was 97.

            A Nationals spokesperson said Lerner died Sunday of complications from pneumonia at his home in Chevy Chase, Maryland.

            Lerner’s group purchased the Nationals from Major League Baseball in 2006 for $450 million after the team was moved to the U.S. capital from Montreal. He was managing principal owner until ceding that role to son Mark in 2018.

            Under the Lerners’ ownership, the Nationals went from one of baseball’s worst teams in their first several seasons in Washington to World Series champions in 2019. The Lerners also are credited with revitalizing the city’s Navy Yard area since Nationals Park opened in 2008.

            TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — New York Yankees left-hander Nestor Cortes will miss next month’s World Baseball Classic due to a strained right hamstring but hasn’t ruled out being ready for the start of the regular season.

            Cortes said the injury is low grade two strain and there is no timeframe. He will not pitch for at least a couple weeks. Cortes first felt a tweak a week ago while running sprints at home.

            Cortes went 12-4 with a 2.44 ERA in 28 starts during an All-Star season last year.

            Colorado left-hander Kyle Freeland replaced Cortes on the United States roster.NFLFox was hoping the matchup of two top teams in the Super Bowl and a close game would lead to a record night.Even though Sunday’s game between the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles came down to a field goal with 8 seconds remaining, Fox fell just short of its goal.The Chiefs’ rally to defeat the Eagles 38-35 is on pace to become the third most-watched television show in history, with an estimated 113 million people watching, according to preliminary numbers released Monday.Fox said the audience estimate includes the broadcasts on Fox and Fox Deportes as well as streaming on Fox and the NFL’s digital sites.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809904,Relics of Fo Guang Shan's Master Hsing Yun in Taiwan,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The recent death of Fo Guang Shan Master Hsing Yun (星雲) has led to the announcement of numerous relics such as milky, pearl-like beads and other colorful crystalline beads after his cremation.Buddhist masters frequently leave behind “sarira,” a Sanskrit term for relics that include sanctified human remains or their personal belongings. Common relics may include finger bones, teeth, or crystalline beads found after the cremation process. The latter was the case for Master Hsing Yun, whose cremation ceremony began on Monday (Feb. 13) at 2:22 p.m.Prior to his death, Master Hsing Yun warned devotees not to expect any relics after his death, as he referred to himself as just an ordinary monk whose wish was to be reincarnated as a monk in his next life.Dharma Drum Mountain founder, Master Sheng Yen (聖嚴), who passed away in 2005, specifically instructed his followers not to collect his relics from his cremated corpses, nor build a grave or stupa in his honor.Though Hsing Yun tried to downplay people’s obsession with popular myths surrounding Buddhist relics, Fo Guang Shan and its followers still talked about it after the cremation ceremony.Fo Guang Shan claimed on Tuesday (Feb. 14) the discovery of relics which ranged in size and color, mostly white but also red, yellow, blue, black and other glazed colors.Scientists and medical doctors have tried to explain the creation of such relics which defy logic. However, they add that crystallized substances can form following the burning of body tissue or calculus cholecystitis of the body.One physician turned Youtuber known as Bluepigeon (蒼藍鴿) was asked by netizens for his comments on the matter but was at a loss for words when asked to comment on Hsing Yun’s relics, according to a Liberty Times report.An article by Liberty Times interviewed Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital's medical team which looked after Master Hsing Yun in the latter stages of his life. Doctors said from the many CT scans that were performed on him, his body did not contain calculus, calcification of tissue, or any stones in his liver, gall bladder, or kidney.Thus, from a medical standpoint, it is impossible to explain the formation of these relics. Religious practitioners, however, claim it is quite common as relics are sanctified remains of those engaged in spiritual practice. A vegetarian diet may also be a cause, as calcium oxalate could precipitate from their bodies during cremation and form stones.According to SETN, the International Journal of Forensic Science published a report saying calcium carbonate in the bones can combine with the salts from the human body, forming crystals of different colors. If the bones are cremated at a high temperature, organic matter in the bones will begin to recombine or reorganize into crystals potentially appearing spherical, flaky, hexagonal, or other irregular shapes and colors.Treasured remains of Fo Guang Shan founder, Master Hsing Yun. (Fo Guang Shan photo)Buddhists believe the creation of relics reflects accumulated merits and virtue over the years, and is the result of mastering the precepts, Samadhi, and wisdom. As for why Hsing Yun said he would leave no relics, it has been interpreted as the late master’s hope that those pursuing Buddhism should return to fundamentals, instead of seeking tangible forms for verification and proof.

One media commentator, Huang Yang-ming (黃揚明), posted on his Facebook page his displeasure over the public revelation of Master Hsing Yun’s relics, an act that Huang said directly contradicted the late master’s wishes. Huang said, “Master Hsing Yun instructed his whole life that the Buddha does not create strange things, and it is not necessary for people to worship the relics.“Huang went on to add that Fo Guang Shan’s press release announcing the presence of relics amongst cremated ashes disregarded Master Hsing Yun’s final instructions and was a bad example for both monastics and the laity.Despite the debate over his earthly remains, Master Hsing Yun has left this realm of humankind. His parting gift may not be limited to a few milky pearls and colored crystals held in a golden bowl, but instead his teachings about loving kindness and compassion.",2023/02/14,3253,Opinion

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809939,"Balloon trials, UFOs, guardrails and Taiwan","TAICHUNG (Taiwan News) — As U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was preparing to visit Beijing to meet the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) top foreign policy official Wang Yi (王毅) on Feb. 1st, a massive Chinese spy balloon was spotted over sensitive military bases in Montana. It quickly became a media sensation.Beijing was clearly embarrassed, and after initially denying it was theirs, later claimed it was a weather balloon blown off course. The Biden administration was also embarrassed, with many wondering why they hadn’t shot it down over Alaskan waters days earlier.The press regularly described it as having a payload the size of three buses, and the Pentagon allegedly decided to wait until it was over the ocean before shooting it down to avoid risk to people on the ground. On February 4, an F-22 shot it down with a missile.All indications were that Beijing had been anticipating the Blinken visit as part of a recent shift towards dampening hostilities at least somewhat on issues like semiconductors, so questions were raised about the timing of the surveillance craft’s visit. There was considerable speculation that either someone in the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) intentionally sent it to sabotage U.S.-China relations, or that someone from a faction hostile to Secretary-General Xi Jinping (習近平) sent it to embarrass him.However, it was soon announced that there had been several previous incursions in U.S. airspace going back to the Trump administration. This meant that more likely the balloon was launched on a pre-arranged schedule unbeknownst to Wang or Xi.Since then, it has been announced that similar flights have happened over dozens of countries on several continents, making that explanation even more likely. Taiwan has spotted dozens in its airspace alone.Public anger in the U.S. meant that Blinken was obliged to cancel the trip. Initially conciliatory, the Chinese side reacted angrily to the shooting down of their aircraft and claimed the right to do so in the future if it happened over their territory.Then things got even worse. Over the last week or so, three smaller Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) have been shot down over the U.S. and Canada.Then China claimed to have also spotted a UFO over Qingdao. They also shot it down.Things have gotten so out of hand that the White House had to state ‘there is no indication of aliens or extra-terrestrial activity.’ Phew. Wouldn’t want to add interplanetary tensions to the mix.There are two concerns going forward, one short-term and the other long-term.The short-term concern is disunity and distraction. When the story broke, Republicans in the U.S. rightfully raised questions about why the administration waited to shoot down the spycraft, why previous ones hadn’t been taken down and kept secret, and how was it that data on previous sightings during the Trump administration are being unearthed now.Those were all reasonable questions that an opposition party should be pressing for answers to. The Chinese, however, do work hard to exploit political divisions for their own benefit, including in order to draw attention away from their own misdeeds.Briefly, it looked like that was going to happen, whether by Chinese design or not: There was talk by Republicans in the House of passing a partisan resolution condemning the administration over the issue (and, of course, to make Democrats look bad). Fortunately, cooler heads prevailed in keeping the focus on what mattered, and the House in the end passed a unanimous bipartisan resolution condemning the real culprit: China.As this crisis continues, keeping that focus is important. More distractions could be on the horizon.Faced with public pressure, the Biden administration decided to adopt a “shoot them all down” approach. There is a risk in that strategy, though.What if one or more of those UFOs turns out to be harmless and civilian? If they recover the wreckage and it turns out it was a high school science project, for example, the headlines attacking the administration will be merciless.That could turn into a distraction. Right now there needs to be a substantive discussion on what to do going forward, including on what to communicate to China in terms of guardrails and how to handle situations when they are violated.That discussion also needs to be had in Taiwan. The military says all options are on the table, and after embarrassing incidents involving Chinese drones over Kinmen, they started shooting those down.Now we find out that dozens of these spy balloons have been flying overhead unmolested in the past. Taiwan needs to set out clear guidelines and policies, both for clarity at home and for the PLA.This brings us to the longer-term concern.The irony in this downward spiraling of relations between the U.S. and China is that this accident derailed a meeting that Blinken had hoped would set guardrails to avoid precisely this kind of situation. His concerns have been proven justified, and they’re set to only get worse unless steps are taken.I don’t think Xi knew about this particular flight, but as chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC) he almost certainly knew about — and authorized — the program. He may have gotten caught off guard that this blew up so publicly now, but he bears responsibility for a program so egregiously in violation of sovereignty that it was bound to happen sooner or later.Worse, this is just the tip of the iceberg. The U.S. military, with a lot of experience going back to the Cold War, is very cautious now about avoiding accidents that could cause damaging international incidents.In the early days of the Cold War, the newly mighty, massive, inexperienced, and often arrogant U.S. military stumbled from incident to incident. Over time, however, it developed the experience, the protocols, and foresight to avoid such incidents as much as possible — though on the scale it operates it remains a possibility.Taiwan is operating on a much smaller scale and is very sensitive to the problem. An incident could set off internal nationalistic pressure inside China that could trigger a bigger conflict, and the Taiwanese are very well aware of the risks.As the size of the PLA balloons and grows more active, the chances for unwanted incidents will continue to grow. Like America’s early days as a superpower, the Chinese aren’t experienced, lack protocols, and are also arrogant.It is also communist in structure, with decision-making powers concentrated in the hands of a very small number of people, who will make errors in judgment. Those below them actively avoid anything that might draw attention to themselves, and only follow orders no matter how misguided they may be — questioning superiors isn’t encouraged, even if the superiors make serious errors in judgment.Worse, the PLA is almost actively courting unwanted international incidents with its activities around Taiwan and in the South China Sea. The PLA is almost in a permanent state of conducting war exercises around Taiwan, and a day without ADIZ incursions makes the news.It doesn’t help that a lot of incidents that are happening are actually clearly intentional. For example, the Philippines have been under constant harassment, so much so they have filed nearly 500 diplomatic protests since 2016, including a new one involving lasers reported hours before the time of publication.However, it is clear that Xi was embarrassed by the spy balloon incident, which damaged his interests and derailed his efforts to improve the relationship with the U.S. Beijing’s economy is still struggling post-Covid lockdown, the real estate business has frozen up, local governments are deeply in the red, debt has been mounting to unsustainable levels, and the U.S. has been increasingly cutting off key technologies.With so much on its plate domestically and economically, Beijing has recently been backing away from its previous aggressive “wolf warrior” diplomacy and has been trying to partially mend some diplomatic relationships, including with the U.S. Partially being the operative word, they have no intention of having genuinely good relations, just taking the confrontation down a notch or two, especially on the economic front.If there is a potential silver lining to this situation, it is that it underscores Blinken’s point on guardrails. This has been clearly demonstrated to Xi, whose own spy program has blown up in his face at a very unwanted and inopportune time and made the situation worse right at the moment he was trying to make it better.Hopefully, this will lead to minds being concentrated even more clearly on establishing guardrails, rules of the road, and lines of communication. If the United States and the Soviet Union could accomplish it in the Cold War, there is hope the PRC will see the value in agreeing to something similar.Establishing guardrails would be in the interests of both sides, and potentially the wider world at large, including Taiwan and the Philippines. Xi won’t give up on his imperialist aims in the region, of course, but some rules of the road may help avoid incidents that are unwelcome on all sides.",2023/02/14,1461,Opinion

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809956,"Ford to cut 3,800 jobs in Europe, mostly in Germany, UK","BERLIN (AP) — Ford said Tuesday that it will cut 3,800 jobs in Europe over the next three years in an effort to streamline its operations as it contends with economic challenges and increasing competition on electric cars.

            The automaker said 2,300 jobs will be eliminated in Germany, 1,300 in the United Kingdom and 200 elsewhere on the continent. It said its strategy to offer an all-electric fleet in Europe by 2035 has not changed and that production of its first European-built electric car is due to start later this year.

            The Dearborn, Michigan-based company said it is looking for “a leaner, more competitive cost structure for Ford in Europe.” The automaker will embark on consultations “with the intent to achieve the reductions through voluntary separation programs.”











            The job cuts come amid a sea change in the global auto industry from gas-guzzling combustion engines to electric vehicles. Governments are pushing to reduce the emissions that contribute to climate change, and a resulting race to develop electric vehicles has generated intense competition among automakers.

            It's even stirred tensions among Western allies as the U.S. rolls out big subsidies for clean technology like EVs that European governments fear could hurt homegrown industry.

            Ford aims to cut 2,800 of the European jobs in engineering by 2025 as a result of the transition to electric cars that are less complex, though it plans to keep about 3,400 engineering jobs on the continent. The remaining 1,000 jobs will be cut on the administrative side.

            “Paving the way to a sustainably profitable future for Ford in Europe requires broad-based actions and changes in the way we develop, build and sell Ford vehicles,"" Martin Sander, general manager of Ford's Model e unit in Europe, said in a statement. ""This will impact the organizational structure, talent and skills we will need in the future.” 

            “These are difficult decisions, not taken lightly,"" he added. ""We recognize the uncertainty it creates for our team, and I assure them we will be offering them our full support in the months ahead.""

            Ford also announced in August cuts of about 3,000 white-collar jobs in North America as it reduces costs to help make the long transition from internal combustion to battery-powered vehicles.

            In a step in that direction, it said Thursday that it plans to build a $3.5 billion factory in Michigan that would employ at least 2,500 people to make lower-cost batteries for new and existing EVs.

            Company officials reported that its net income fell 90% in the last three months of 2022 from a year earlier. It said costs were too high and that it contended with a global shortage of computer chips and other parts used in its vehicles.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810004,Tunisian Islamist leader arrested in crackdown on opposition,"TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) — Tunisian authorities arrested the leader of the Ennahda opposition Islamist movement in a crackdown on rival politicians and critics of the North African country's increasingly authoritarian president Kais Saied, lawyers said Tuesday. 

            Noureddine Bhiri, a senior Ennahda leader, was taken into custody by armed police at his home in the capital, Tunis, late Monday on suspicion of being part of a “conspiracy against the country’s security,” the movement’s lawyer, Ines Harrathi, said in a Facebook post.

            Lazhar Akremi, a lawyer and critic of Saied, and Noureddine Bouttar, the director general of an independent radio station, Mosaïque, were also arrested by the security forces in the early hours of Tuesday, according to Bouttar’s lawyer, Dalila Msaddek.











            Authorities have not released any information on the wave of arrests that started over the weekend.

            The crackdown — targeting Tunisian opposition figures, the president’s critics and opponents in the media, judiciary and business community — comes after a disastrous parliamentary election last month in which only 11% of the voters cast their ballots. The vote was organized by Saied, who is determined to reshape the country’s political system and replace a legislature that he had dissolved in 2021. 

            Another prominent member of Ennahda, Andelhamid Jelassi was arrested on Saturday, according to the movement’s lawyer, along with Khayam Turki, a former leader of the social-democratic Ettakatol party. Turki’s lawyers said he was taken into custody after a meeting at his home to rally the opposition against Saied and prevent him from strengthening his grip on power. 

            On the eve of the arrests Friday, Saied called on Justice Minister Leila Jaffel to swiftly clear the backlog of legal cases that the president claims “have been dragging on for years.” Those include the prosecution of “traitors,” who Saied said are sowing discontent and inciting anger in the country, leading to chaos and causing food and fuel shortages. 

            Ennahda condemned the arrests and accused Saied’s government of “abducting and prosecuting” the president’s opponents to “distract from the economic and political crisis,"" according to a statement the movement issued late Monday. It called for an immediate release of all who have been held in an “illegal detention.”

            Tunisia is going through a major economic crisis, with soaring inflation and unemployment, particularly among the country’s youth. Critics of Saied's leadership and political elites accuse them of bringing the country's economy to the brink of bankruptcy. 

            Ennahda's vice president and former Tunisian Prime Minister Ali Laraydeh has been detained since December. The movement says his arrest is part of Saied's campaign to to marginalize the popular Islamists party. ,TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) — Tunisian authorities arrested the leader of the Ennahda opposition Islamist movement in a crackdown on rival politicians and critics of the North African country's increasingly authoritarian president Kais Saied, lawyers said Tuesday.Noureddine Bhiri, a senior Ennahda leader, was taken into custody by armed police at his home in the capital, Tunis, late Monday on suspicion of being part of a “conspiracy against the country’s security,” the movement’s lawyer, Ines Harrathi, said in a Facebook post.Lazhar Akremi, a lawyer and critic of Saied, and Noureddine Bouttar, the director general of an independent radio station, Mosaïque, were also arrested by the security forces in the early hours of Tuesday, according to Bouttar’s lawyer, Dalila Msaddek.Authorities have not released any information on the wave of arrests that started over the weekend.The crackdown — targeting Tunisian opposition figures, the president’s critics and opponents in the media, judiciary and business community — comes after a disastrous parliamentary election last month in which only 11% of the voters cast their ballots.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810005,Dortmund targets big-spending Chelsea in Champions League,"DUESSELDORF, Germany (AP) — Chelsea has one of the most talented and expensive group of players ever assembled in world soccer. Now might be the ideal time to beat them.

            Borussia Dortmund is targeting an upset of big-spending Chelsea in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 meeting Wednesday. Chelsea's recent run of three straight draws in the Premier League — including 1-1 against West Ham on Saturday — should be an encouraging sign for the German team.

            Against West Ham, Chelsea looked like a group of extremely talented individuals who have just been introduced. That, of course, is exactly what they are. 











            In a starting line-up containing five January signings, João Félix, Enzo Fernández and Mykhailo Mudryk all shone in brief glimpses but didn't form a cohesive unit before West Ham leveled the score and Chelsea gradually faded away in the second half. 

            Given time, though, Chelsea's communication will improve. If the timing of Chelsea's runs had been slightly better, two goals ruled out for offside early on might have stood and the game could have become a rout. 

            Playing in front of Dortmund's deafeningly loud “Yellow Wall” of fans is never easy, and the German team will fancy its chance of an upset win. Dortmund goes into the game having won all six of its games in 2023. Chelsea's record in the new year is one win from eight, and even that was an underwhelming 1-0 at home to Crystal Palace.

            In Sébastien Haller, Dortmund has a striker who scored 11 Champions League goals last season for Ajax. Haller is in line to make his European debut for Dortmund after missing all of the first half of the season while being treated for testicular cancer. He hasn't yet played a full 90 minutes but he's integrated well into the team. 

            Any Dortmund fans still looking for two of their club's old heroes in the Chelsea team will be disappointed. Christian Pulisic has not played since early January with a knee problem, and the American may be squeezed out of the team by the new signings once he is fit. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang was cut from Chelsea's Champions League squad entirely to make way for the new arrivals. 

            Dortmund's standout at the weekend in an often-turgid 2-0 win over Werder Bremen was Jamie Bynoe-Gittens, an 18-year-old forward from London who was briefly part of Chelsea's youth system as a young child. He came off the bench to break the deadlock against Bremen with his third goal in nine league games this season, underlining his status 

            As always when Dortmund plays, and especially against English opposition, all eyes will be on Jude Bellingham. The England midfielder looks likely to be at the center of a transfer frenzy this summer, and Dortmund has admitted it can't hope to match contract offers from top European teams. 

            There was a blow Monday when 18-year-old forward Youssoufa Moukoko was ruled out of the Chelsea game with an ankle injury that's expected to need six weeks' recovery time.

            Dortmund has saved some of its best performances this season for its biggest opponents and held Manchester City to a 0-0 draw last time it hosted English opposition in October. For a team often in Bayern Munich's shadow, what could be better than beating world soccer's biggest spenders?

He came off the bench to break the deadlock against Bremen with his third goal in nine league games this season, underlining his statusAs always when Dortmund plays, and especially against English opposition, all eyes will be on Jude Bellingham. The England midfielder looks likely to be at the center of a transfer frenzy this summer, and Dortmund has admitted it can't hope to match contract offers from top European teams.There was a blow Monday when 18-year-old forward Youssoufa Moukoko was ruled out of the Chelsea game with an ankle injury that's expected to need six weeks' recovery time.Dortmund has saved some of its best performances this season for its biggest opponents and held Manchester City to a 0-0 draw last time it hosted English opposition in October.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810006,"UAE's COP28 leader: 'Fight climate change, not each other'","DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — The United Arab Emirates' pick to lead the upcoming COP28 climate talks in Dubai called on the world Tuesday to “fight climate change, not each other,” directly addressing the anger activists have felt over his selection. 

            Sultan al-Jaber, the CEO of Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., also described the upcoming United Nations negotiations as an “unprecedented opportunity to engage the energy industry in a technological revolution.” 

            His speech at the World Government Summit in Dubai sought to present his nominated presidency as a bridge between oil companies and climate activists long suspicious of the industry's influence on efforts to limit carbon emissions. Whether it will, however, remains in question. 











            “We need a major course correction,” al-Jaber said. 

            However, he added: “The strategies we pursue must leave no one behind. The policies we adopt must be pro-growth and pro-climate at the same time.”

            The speech renewed criticism among activists of al-Jaber's nomination to shepherd the climate talks.

            African youth climate activist Eric Njuguna from Kenya termed the remarks ‘’dismissive of valid and merited concerns brought forth by climate activists."" He called on the U.N. body overseeing the talks to install a conflict of interest policy that checks the influence that oil and gas firms have on the climate talks owing to their “long history of skewing and watering down important climate decisions.

            Al-Jaber, a 49-year-old longtime climate envoy, is a trusted confidant of UAE leader Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. He's been behind tens of billions of dollars spent or pledged toward renewable energy — and also leads an oil company that pumps some 4 million barrels of crude a day and hopes to expand to 5 million daily. 

            That oil money fuels the ambitions of this federation of seven sheikhdoms on the Arabian Peninsula — as well as the production of more of the heat-trapping carbon dioxide that the U.N. negotiations hope to limit.

            Activists have equated his nomination to asking “arms dealers to lead peace talks” when authorities announced his nomination in January. However, U.S. climate envoy John Kerry and France's finance minister both have backed his selection by the UAE, a key Mideast ally. The UAE also wants to be carbon neutral by 2050 — a target that remains difficult to assess and one that authorities haven’t fully explained how they’ll reach. 

            ""There are moments in history when humanity comes together to fight a common threat. Let’s prove to ourselves that we can do it once again,"" al-Jaber said. “Let’s put our differences aside. Fight climate change, not each other.”

            Al-Jaber's speech, which included portions he previously delivered in January, also acknowledged that “capital is critical to make the loss-and-damage fund real and operational.” That fund, agreed to at the COP27 talks in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, did not include a means by which to fund them. Al-Jaber's speech also didn't offer a suggestion on how to raise the money. 

            However, he did call for “real reform of international financial institutions and multilateral banks” to lower the lending risk and provide more private financing for “vulnerable communities.”

            Al-Jaber called on the world to triple its renewable energy capacity, as well as expand nuclear power, improve battery storage and provide carbon-capture technology. He also drew applause from the largely Emirati audience by defending the OPEC-member nation hosting the climate talks. 

            “We in the UAE are not shying away from the energy transition,” al-Jaber said. “We are running towards it.”

            Each year, the country hosting the U.N. negotiations known as the Conference of the Parties — where COP gets its name — nominates a person to chair the talks. Hosts typically pick a veteran diplomat as the talks can be difficult to steer between competing nations and their interests. 

            The nominee’s position as “COP president” is confirmed by delegates at the start of the talks, usually without objections. However, activists' ire over al-Jaber's selection could see a turbulent start to the negotiations.

            Amnesty International on Monday reiterated a call for al-Jaber to resign as president-designate and criticized plans by the Abu Dhabi National Oil Co.’s drilling arm to pump more oil as it saw record profits last quarter.

            “Sultan al-Jaber cannot be an honest broker for climate talks when the company he leads is planning to cause more climate damage,"" Amnesty's Marta Schaaf said in a statement. “It is obvious, despite Sultan al-Jaber’s denials, that his dual role is a glaring conflict of interest which will contribute to further climate disaster and unfolding human rights violations.”

            COP28 will be held at Dubai’s Expo City from Nov. 30 through Dec. 12.

The consolidated revenue of PCPD and its subsidiaries (together, the ""Group"") amounted to HK$ 561 million, representing an increase of 20% compared to the revenue of HK$ 467 million in 2021.   The Group's consolidated operating loss amounted to HK$ 215 million, representing a decrease of approximately 40% compared to the operating loss of HK$ 358 million in 2021.   The consolidated net loss attributable to equity holders of the Company for the year of 2022 was HK$ 598 million, compared to the net loss of HK$ 825 million in 2021.   Basic loss per share for 2022 was 29.34 Hong Kong cents compared to the loss per share of 42.46 Hong Kong cents for the previous year.   The Board of Directors has not recommended the payment of a final dividend for the year ended December 31, 2022.   As the world began to embark on the path of normality in 2022 following more than two years of COVID-19 pandemic, the Group's business remained steady during the year. In particular in Asia, where various countries and regions relaxed their travel restrictions and reopened borders progressively, we have benefited from improved market sentiment.   Park Hyatt Niseko, Hanazono, our hotel operations in Hokkaido, turned in a satisfactory performance in 2022 year-on-year, mainly because Japan opened up its borders in October. In the month of December 2022, the occupancy was 62%, an increase from 38% recorded in the same period in 2021.   In Jakarta, Indonesia, the occupancy of our premium commercial building, Pacific Century Place, Jakarta (""PCP Jakarta""), remained stable throughout the year. At the end of December 31, 2022, the office space occupancy was 81%, compared to 80% the previous year.   In Phang Nga, Thailand, visitors to the golf clubhouse and the 18-hole golf course and the number of golf rounds increased notably during the year, thanks to the Thai government's decision to ease travel restrictions progressively.   The foundation work for our property development project at 3–6 Glenealy, Central, has been progressing well since its commencement in the first quarter of 2022.   Global tourism arrivals are expected to increase further in 2023. Meanwhile, China's reopening, together with ebbing inflation and slowing interest rate hikes, is likely to help bring Asia's economic growth back on track.   Mr. Benjamin Lam, PCPD's Deputy Chairman and Group Managing Director, said: ""As the world is moving on from COVID-19, we take a cautiously optimistic outlook on the real estate sectors in Hong Kong, Japan, Thailand and Indonesia. Nonetheless, we will not lose sight of the challenges and uncertainties in 2023, such as inflation and a potential global recession. We will closely monitor market conditions and follow a prudent approach, while staying nimble in the way we operate our businesses in order to capture growth opportunities.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810048,Police seek motive of gunman who killed 3 at Michigan State,"EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) — The 43-year-old gunman who killed three students and wounded five others at Michigan State University had no apparent connection to the campus, police said Tuesday as they searched for a motive for shootings that terrified the community for hours. 

            Investigators were sorting out why Anthony McRae fired inside an academic building and the student union just before 8:30 p.m. Monday. An hourslong lockdown at the campus in East Lansing ended when he killed himself miles away while being confronted by police.

            The shooting happened the day before the fifth anniversary of the Parkland, Florida, school shooting that killed 17 and is the latest in what has become a deadly new year in the U.S.











            “We have to do something to stop the gun violence that’s ripping apart our communities,” President Joe Biden said in a speech Tuesday, mentioning Michigan State.

            Meanwhile, a school district in Ewing Township, New Jersey, closed for the day after investigators said that McRae, who lived in the area years ago, had a note in his pocket indicating a threat to schools there. But it was determined there was no credible threat, local police said later in a statement shared by the superintendent.

            The dead and injured in the gunfire at Berkey Hall and the MSU Union, a popular place to eat and study, were all Michigan State students. Five remained in critical condition at Sparrow Hospital, said Dr. Denny Martin, who fought back tears during a news conference Tuesday.

            “We have absolutely no idea what the motive was,” said Chris Rozman, deputy chief of campus police, adding that McRae, of Lansing, was not a student or Michigan State employee. 

            “This is still fluid,” Rozman said. “There are still crime scenes that are being processed, and we still are in the process of putting together the pieces to try to understand what happened.”

            The dead were all from the Detroit area. Two gradated from separate high schools in the Grosse Pointe district: Brian Fraser, president of Phi Delta Theta fraternity, and Arielle Anderson. Alexandria Verner, a graduate of Clawson High School in another Detrot suburb, also died.

            “If you knew her, you loved her and we will forever remember the lasting impact she has had on all of us,” Clawson Superintendent Billy Shellenbarger said in an email to families. 

            The shootings took place in an area of older, stately buildings on the northern edge of the Michigan State campus, one of the nation’s largest at 5,200 acres. Just across busy Grand River Avenue lies East Lansing’s downtown, teeming with restaurants, bars and shops.

            “Our Spartan community is reeling today,” Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Michigan State graduate, said at the morning briefing.

            Biden pledged his support during a phone call, she said.

            “We mourn the loss of beautiful souls today and pray for those who are continuing to fight for their lives. ... Another place that is supposed to be about community and togetherness is shattered by bullets and bloodshed,” Whitmer said.

            Michigan State has about 50,000 students, including 19,000 who live on campus. As hundreds of officers scoured the campus, about 90 miles (145 kilometers) northwest of Detroit, students hid where they could Monday night.

            At 11 p.m., police were still searching for McRae when he turned up on school security cameras, and his image was quickly released to news media. An “alert citizen” saw the picture, recognized him in the Lansing area and contacted police within minutes, Rozman said.

            “That was exactly what we were trying to achieve by releasing that picture. We had no idea where he was at that point,” the deputy chief said.

            Officers confronted McRae about 5 miles (8 kilometers) from campus in an industrial area, where he killed himself, Rozman said. 

            In 2019, McRae was accused of illegally possessing a concealed weapon, according to the state Corrections Department, but pleaded guilty to having a loaded gun in a vehicle, a misdemeanor. He completed 18 months of probation.

            A large police presence was in his Lansing neighborhood overnight. Suzanne Shook said she has lived a block away from McRae for about a year.

            ""We never spoke to him,” Shook said. ""When he would be walking or riding his bike, he was always straightforward and wouldn’t look at anybody.” 

            Students, meanwhile, recalled the previous night's terror. Dominik Molotky said he was learning about Cuban history around 8:15 p.m. when he and the other students heard a gunshot outside the classroom. He told ABC’s “Good Morning America"" that a few seconds later, the gunman entered and fired three to four more rounds.

            “I was ducking and covering, and the same with the rest of the students,"" Molotky said. 

            Claire Papoulias, a sophomore, described on NBC’s “Today” how she and other students scrambled to escape a history class through a window after the gunman entered from a back door and began firing.

            “As soon as I fell out of the window I kind of hit the ground a little. I just grabbed my backpack and my phone, and I remember I just ran for my life,” she said.

            All classes, sports and other activities were canceled for 48 hours. Interim university President Teresa Woodruff said it would be a time “to think and grieve and come together.”

            Dozens of people have died in mass shootings so far in 2023, most notably in California, where 11 people were killed as they welcomed the Lunar New Year at a dance hall popular with older Asian Americans. In 2022, more than 600 mass shootings occurred in the U.S. in which at least four people were killed or wounded, according to the Gun Violence Archive.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810049,Germany to produce ammo for air defense guns sent to Ukraine,"BERLIN (AP) — Germany has signed a deal for new ammunition for self-propelled anti-aircraft guns it provided to Ukraine to be produced at home after it ran into difficulties securing supplies from elsewhere, the defense minister said Tuesday.

            Germany has supplied 32 of the Gepard anti-aircraft guns since it first agreed to send them to Ukraine in late April, and has pledged 37 in total. The German military hasn't used them since 2012, so they came from stocks held in reserve by the defense industry.

            Securing more ammunition for the guns has been a challenge, a matter of mounting concern as defense against repeated barrages of Russian missile and drone strikes has become a top priority for Kyiv.











            Germany so far has been unsuccessful in months of efforts to persuade neutral Switzerland to approve exports to Ukraine of stockpiles in the Alpine country of Gepard ammunition, which was manufactured there by a subsidiary of German defense company Rheinmetall. 

            There are also stocks of the ammunition in Brazil, but President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva made clear when German Chancellor Olaf Scholz visited last month that his country wants no involvement of any kind in the war in Ukraine and wouldn't provide Germany with any.

            Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said as he arrived at a meeting with counterparts from other allies of Ukraine in Brussels on Tuesday that contracts have now been signed to produce new ammunition in Germany.

            “That means we will now start our own production of Gepard ammunition at Rheinmetall without delay,"" Pistorius told reporters. “I am very happy that this succeeded because it better secures our independence and faster delivery.”

            The minister said that “the negotiations with Switzerland took time, and in the end we were of the opinion that it is better to go our own way faster so as not to be dependent on them.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810051,Palestinian teen killed in Israeli army raid in West Bank,"JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli forces shot and killed a Palestinian teenager Tuesday during an army raid in a refugee camp in the northern West Bank, Palestinian officials said. 

            The death was the latest in an almost year-long surge in Israeli-Palestinian violence that shows no signs of abating.

            Meanwhile, in the southern West Bank city of Hebron, a video captured by an American journalist showing an Israeli soldier shoving a Palestinian activist to the ground and then kicking him caused an uproar online — prompting the Israeli military to jail the soldier for 10 days.











            Early on Tuesday, the Israeli military said it carried out raids across the occupied West Bank overnight. During an operation in the Faraa refugee camp near the northeastern city of Tubas, the army said it opened fire on a Palestinian who approached troops with an explosive device. The camp is home to a recently formed militant cell affiliated with Palestinian Islamic Jihad, an Islamist group.

            The Palestinian Health Ministry said that 17-year-old Mahmoud al-Aydi died from a bullet wound to the head. No militant group immediately claimed him as a member. 

            Also on Tuesday, a 25-year-old Palestinian succumbed to wounds he suffered two years ago when the Israeli army shot him in Masafer Yatta, in the southern West Bank, leaving him paralyzed from the neck down.

            Palestinian health officials identified him as Haroun Abu Aram. Footage from the incident in 2021 showed him struggling to prevent Israeli security forces from confiscating his portable generator before a shot rang out, and he collapsed.

            Tensions have mounted for months as Israel has escalated arrest raids in the West Bank, which were prompted by a spate of Palestinian attacks on Israelis last spring. Some 30 people were killed in Israel by Palestinians in 2022, and at least 12 others died in attacks so far in 2023.

            An Israeli Border Police officer died Monday after he was stabbed by a Palestinian teen in east Jerusalem. A security guard opened fire at the assailant, but police say he also wound up shooting and critically wounding 1st Sgt. Asil Su'ad. A Bedouin Arab serving in Israel's paramilitary police force, Su’ad was to be laid to rest in northern Israel on Tuesday.

            In Hebron, prominent Palestinian activist Issa Amro was giving an interview to Lawrence Wright of The New Yorker magazine on Monday when an Israeli soldier grabbed Amro by the neck as if to choke him before throwing him onto a brick sidewalk, footage posted by Wright on Twitter showed. The soldier kicked Amro as he lay on the ground and began to drag him on the concrete before another soldier intervened, pulling him away from Amro. 

            Late on Monday, the Israeli army said the soldier would serve 10 days in military prison and be suspended from active combat duty, adding, “As the video shows, the soldier did not act as expected and did not follow the (military's) code of conduct."" 

            Palestinian and human rights groups accuse the Israeli military of frequently using excessive force and say soldiers are rarely punished for violent acts. Even in the most shocking cases — and those captured on video — soldiers often get relatively light sentences.

            Yet Israel's ultranationalist National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir lambasted the punishment as a “disgrace.” He has long called for a relaxation of open-fire regulations and immunity from criminal prosecution for members of the security forces acting in combat situations in the West Bank.

            “Soldiers deserve to be backed up, not jailed,” Ben-Gvir wrote on Twitter.

            Nearly 150 Palestinians were killed last year in the West Bank and east Jerusalem, making it the deadliest year in those areas since 2004, according to figures by the Israeli rights group B’Tselem. At least 48 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli troops since the start of this year.

            Israel says that most of those killed have been militants but others — including youths protesting the incursions and other people not involved in confrontations — have also been killed.

            Israel says the military raids are meant to dismantle militant networks and thwart future attacks while the Palestinians view them as further entrenchment of Israel’s open-ended, 55-year occupation.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810053,Kyiv clamors for fighter jets as war nears ‘critical’ phase,"BRUSSELS (AP) — Ukraine on Tuesday renewed its appeal to Western countries for fighter jets to help frustrate Moscow’s almost year-long invasion, but won no assurances at a high-level defense meeting in Brussels that it would receive any combat aircraft.

            “I don’t have any announcements on aircraft to make today,” U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told reporters after chairing a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact group at NATO headquarters, where 54 countries were represented.

            Even so, Ukraine’s allies pledged more weapons, ammunition and tanks as senior defense officials at the meeting said the war with Russia is approaching a critical stage.











            “This isn’t about one single capability,” Austin told a press conference, referring to the warplanes. “It’s about delivering all the capabilities that we promised. It’s about integrating these systems together.”

            The first challenge, he said, is to make sure all the military aid is used effectively.

            “It’s a monumental task to bring all those systems together and get the troops trained on those platforms,” he said.

            As Moscow musters its forces for a potential push in eastern Ukraine, Austin said Kyiv could launch its own offensive in the spring.

            With the war set to enter its second year at the end of next week, Ukraine Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov was in Brussels to press his country's case for fighter jets, holding up an image of a warplane when asked what military aid his country is seeking.

            Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy pushed hard for combat planes last week when he visited London, Paris and Brussels on just his second foreign trip since Russia invaded on Feb. 24, 2022. His plea came days after Western allies pledged to provide Kyiv with tanks.

            Moscow’s forces have been pressing in the east of Ukraine while bolstering their defensive lines in the south. The war has been largely static during the winter months, though both sides are expected to launch offensives when the weather improves.

            Ukraine’s dogged resistance and Western weapons and intelligence have helped thwart the Kremlin’s ambitions of securing the entire eastern Donbas region. But the risk remains that in some areas Kyiv’s forces could be overwhelmed by the sheer weight of Russian troop numbers.

            Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Russian forces are “struggling mightily” and making only slow progress in the Donbas. “However, they do have numbers” to keep fighting, Milley said.

            Putin was hoping Western support for Kyiv would fizzle out, Austin, the U.S. defense secretary, said.

            “Today’s meeting comes at a critical time,” Austin said. “The Kremlin is still betting that it can wait us out.”

            NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, asked when he expects Russia’s so-called spring offensive to begin, said that “the reality is that we have seen the start already.”

            “For me, this just highlights the importance of timing. It’s urgent to provide Ukraine with more weapons,” he told reporters in Brussels. 

            Another issue occupying the minds of NATO allies is how to keep up a steady supply of ammunition to Ukraine without depleting their own stockpiles.

            According to some estimates, Ukraine is firing up to 6,000-7,000 artillery shells each day, around a third of the daily amount that Russia is using.

            Stoltenberg warned Monday that Ukraine is using up ammunition much faster than its allies can supply it.

            However, the Russians appear short on resources for any major offensive at the moment, the U.K. Ministry of Defense said.

            ""Overall, the current operational picture suggests that Russian forces are being given orders to advance in most sectors, but that they have not massed sufficient offensive combat power on any one axis to achieve a decisive effect,"" it tweeted.

            In Ukraine, the country’s presidential office said Tuesday that Russian shelling killed at least three civilians and wounded another eight over the previous 24 hours as fighting continued in the south and east.

            Russian forces shelled 17 towns and villages in the Donetsk region. Gov. Pavlo Kyrylenko said. “The Russians are destroying everything in their path,” he said. 

            Ukraine officials also reported intense shelling and air strikes in Luhansk province, while in the south Russian forces shelled the city of Kherson 13 times over 24 hours, destroying a railway and residential buildings.

He was also set to attend a US-led meeting for the coordination of weapon deliveries to Ukraine alongside around 50 countries on Tuesday morning.It is expected that Reznikov will call for the delivery of fighter jets after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appealed for the supply of planes while in Brussels last week.No decision on the fighter jets has yet been made, nor was one expected for Tuesday.Also on the agenda is how to better protect critical underwater infrastructure following alleged acts of sabotage on the Nord Stream natural gas pipelines. On Wednesday, the gathering was expected to focus on NATO's presence in eastern Europe.Finland and Sweden's potential accession to NATO, and Turkey's attempt to block the move, would also be part of the discussions.NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg called for a prompt supply of ammunition, fuel and spare parts to Ukraine on Monday.Stoltenberg reiterated that NATO had to guarantee Ukraine received the weapons it needed ""to win this war"" and that Russian President Vladimir Putin was not arranging for peace but rather ""preparing for more war.""""We see no signs that President Putin is preparing for peace, what we see is the opposite, he is preparing for more war, new offensives and new attacks,"" said Stoltenberg.""This is a grinding war of attrition, therefore a battle of logistics,"" added Stoltenberg, referring to Ukraine's calls for further weapons and fighter jets.German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said he expected the war in Ukraine to be long-lasting.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810071,"Bollywood romances: More than sarees, songs and Switzerland","""The course of true love never did run smooth,"" wrote William Shakespeare in the opening scene of ""A Midsummer Night's Dream.""It may not be appropriate advice on Valentine's Day, but has served as a template for many a romantic film that has emerged from India's Bollywood film factory.The epic romance films of the celebrated Hindi filmmaker and producer Yash Chopra (1932-2012) are a case in point. His 1995 classic ""Dilwale Duhania Le Jayenge"" (The Big-Hearted Will Take Away The Bride) remains the longest-running film in Indian cinema history — and sealed Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan's reputation as King of Romance.The award-winning director and his romance musicals is the subject of a new Netflix docuseries, ""The Romantics,"" that premieres on the streaming service on Valentine's Day.Featuring interviews with the who's who of Bollywood, the series explores Chopra's vision for expressing love on celluloid — from lavish outfits and heartfelt songs to alpine settings.In the 1990s, Yash Chopra kept the romance blockbusters coming with 1997's ""Dil Toh Pagal Hai,"" or ""The heart is crazy.""The Hindi romantic drama revolved around members of a musical troupe in which two female dancers, Pooja and Nisha — played by actors Madhuri Dixit and Karisma Kapoor — are enmeshed in a love triangle with their choreographer Rahul.With then up-and-coming Bollywood heartthrob, Shah Rukh Khan, playing Rahul, the film was packed with unsaid longings, heartbreak, confrontations, big reveals and a happy ending.These romance tropes were not confined to Bollywood: Hollywood too was churning out the romantic melodramas and comedies, from Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman to James Cameron's ""Titanic""  and Richard Curtis' ""Love, Actually.""However, as a Bollywood love story, ""Dil Toh Pagal Hai"" was distinctive for the extensive song dance numbers, and over-the-top emoting.Other Yash Chopra romance hallmarks included urbane and attractive protagonists, trendsetting fashion, stirring dialogue, and poetic song lyrics.Besides his knack for tackling complicated love stories with sensitivity, Chopra's films were set apart by their heroine-centric storytelling. His leading ladies were often strong-willed, forward-thinking characters who sometimes loved unconventionally.In ""Dil Toh Pagal Hai,"" for example, Rahul apologizes tearfully to his best friend Nisha, whose love he cannot reciprocate. As Nisha eventually moves on and the two remain friends, Chopra protrays a healthy, and equal, adult relationship.In 1981's ""Silsila"" (""Continuation""), starring Bollywood doyen Amitabh Bachchan together with his real-life wife Jaya and fellow actor Rekha, Chopra's story of an extra-marital affair avoided portraying Rekha's ""other woman"" as the stereotypical conniving vamp.Meanwhile, in ""Chandni"" (""Moonlight"") from 1989, the late actcress Sridevi played the free-spirited lead character who has to choose between two suitors — but is no pushover in making her ultimate decision.The filmmaker was known for favoring foreign locations for song and dance sequences, with Switzerland topping his list.He first became smitten by the alpine country's landscape after honeymooning there himself in 1970, eventually returning to shoot several film sequences.""At that time few of us had the disposable income to go to Switzerland and see these things. And so, we traveled vicariously through these films,"" Anupama Chopra, Indian journalist and film critic says in the Netflix documentary.The Swiss returned his love by erecting a statue in 2016 to Chopra for boosting the country's popularity among Indian tourists via his films.Chopra recalled in an interview how he responded to critics who preferred fight sequences over songs: ""If you think a fight is a highlight, I feel a song is a highlight. It's a bigger highlight because a song remains with you after you go out of the theater."" Even today, songs from Chopra's films make wedding celebration playlists.Bollywood romances may not have universal appeal, but they have been steadily gaining non-Indian and non-Hindi speaking fans for how love is perceived and expressed in other ways.Perhaps actor Abishek Bachchan best explains Bollywood's allure in the series: ""Our movies are like our food, our thali (a platter of several different dishes). There's a little bit of everything in it. Every emotion and every style.""Netflix's ""The Romantics"" begins streaming on February 14, 2023.",2023/02/14,,

In the north, in Luhansk, there were further offensive efforts through the Russian forces, however the attacks remained ""on too small a scale to achieve a significant breakthrough.""The update went on to say that Russian forces were trying to reverse the gains made by Ukraine at the end of 2022, with a ""realistic possibility""  of them advancing west to the Zherberets River. Overall, Britain's defense ministry suggested that Russian forces had not obtained ""massed sufficient offensive combat power"".A South Korean court accepted two Russian nationals' pleas to apply for refugee status after they were stuck in the Incheon airport, close to Seoul, for months.They will now be allowed to enter the country.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810074,Slow flowers: Climate-friendly Valentine's Day blooms,"Sending a bouquet of chemicals to a significant other on Valentine's Day is not exactly the epitome of romance. But on February 14, that is exactly what people all over the world often do when they gift conventionally grown flowers.During winter in the Northern Hemisphere, roses are flown in from the southern half of the planet. The sunny climate there makes for ideal growing conditions. But pesticides banned in Europe used in conventional flower farming are dangerous to the local environment and industry workers in countries like Kenya, according to German environmental group BUND.Flowers flown long distances also have a large carbon footprint, as do those grown in heated greenhouses in famous floriculture-producing nations like the Netherlands.Colorful blossoms might be scarce in colder months, but that does not mean those looking for a greener choice have to resort to presenting their significant others with a handful of sticks on Valentine's Day. There are alternatives available.Roses need not be the go-to flower on Valentine's Day, said Elke Markwort, who runs a floristry in the western German city of Münster.""Spring blossoms also make for beautiful Valentine's bouquets. For example, I planted little grape hyacinths in heart-shaped dishes and decorated them with fair-trade felt hearts.""In Markwort's shop, alongside flowers produced in conventional ways, customers will find some blossoms the florist grows herself in warmer months. She is a member of Germany's burgeoning ""Slow Flower Movement.""A mixed crew of shop owners, hobby gardeners, flower farmers, and events florists, the movement is all about promoting sustainably and regionally-grown blooms free from pesticides and chemical fertilizers.""When it comes to groceries, so many people now look at where their food comes from and how it was grown, but unfortunately that's rarely the case with flowers,"" said Jane Silburn, a flower farmer and spokesperson for the Slow Flower Movement.""We use sustainably produced seeds, try to make our own compost out of plant residue, and don't use flower foam blocks,"" explained Silburn. The foam blocks made from plastic are soaked in water and used to keep flower centerpieces fresh. But they contribute to microplastic pollution.No matter the time of year, Silburn says there are plenty of ways to get creative with flower arrangements while adhering to the movement's philosophy. In February, the first tulips start to sprout in greenhouses that are heated just by sunlight, and the branches of fruit trees can blossom when kept in in warm homes.""Even in winter, you can make exciting pieces by working with knotted branches. There's so much texture and structure there. A lot of things in winter and at the beginning of spring can be beautiful if you move away from the classic floral idea,"" said Silburn.Dried flowers are another option to brighten up winter days. They're harvested in summer, gently dried to retain as much color as possible, and stored for the winter, without the chemicals often used in conventionally dried flowers.""Everlasting flowers, sea lavender and lavender, as well as hydrangeas, dry beautifully,"" added Silburn, as do seed heads, like poppies, grasses, and leafy plants.Dried flowers are a big hit right now, said Silburn. A quick glance at flower influencers on social media would appear to confirm that. They are selling well in Elke Markwort's shop in Münster, too.""I'm really pleased that dried flowers are in demand again. In winter, we have wonderful money plants, or lunaria, that we grow ourselves, and we combine those with our own eucalyptus and branches,"" said the florist.The slow flower philosophy isn't just confined to Germany. Flowers from the Farm was founded 10 years ago in the UK, and now has 1,000 members. The USA and Italy have their own movements.In Germany, Austria, and German-speaking Switzerland, the association has about 200 members. More than three quarters work alone or with a partner, and more than half sell sustainable flowers as a side gig.Many members sell their products online, including Jane Silburn. They're conscious of the transport emissions but ""think it's a lesser evil to send sustainable flowers rather than telling people 'if you don't live near a slow flower field, you'll have to buy conventional flowers.'""They avoid plastic where possible, and GM plants are a taboo. But that does not mean the slow flower movement is fully organic. Silburn says there are organic farms among their members, but that there is no independent organic certification. The association relies on voluntary adherence to its own guidelines.Slow flowers are pricier than flowers sold en masse in supermarkets. That's because of the manual labor involved — from cultivating and tending to flowers in the field, to harvesting, Silburn explains.""Flowers are luxury products, and so they should be. People should appreciate them again and not view them as a cheap mass product,"" said Silburn.Despite the higher prices, demand for regionally and sustainably grown flowers is high, says florist Elke Markwort.

The MND held a regular press conference on Tuesday morning, during which Major General Huang Wen-chi (黃文啓), who is with the Office of Deputy Chief of the General Staff on Intelligence, said that the balloons detected by radar were divided into those for civilian use and those that pose a national security risk, and should be dealt with accordingly.Huang said most of the balloons found around Taiwan were weather balloons. These balloons are small and lightweight, and will burst once they have ascended to a certain altitude, he added.On the other hand, a reconnaissance balloon would be detected on MND radar, disputing foreign media reports that Taiwan’s military would be unable to detect such a craft, Huang added.Huang stressed that Taiwan's handling of spy balloons is similar to that of the U.S.; that is, only those posing a threat to national security and people's livelihood will be dealt with. However, so far, Taiwan has not encountered balloons that pose such a threat.",2023/02/14,1975,Politics
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810076,Analysis: Russell Westbrook could help NBA playoff contender,"Nikola Jokic and Luka Doncic are doing it. So are LeBron James, James Harden and LaMelo Ball. They are among the six players in the NBA averaging at least 15 points, six rebounds and seven assists per game this season.

            That’s two MVP front-runners, three current All-Stars and two other players who should have been, at minimum, under All-Star consideration this season.

            There’s one other member of the 15-6-7 club: Russell Westbrook.











            As the league gears up for it's All-Star festivities this weekend, Westbrook is deciding whether he wants to play out this season in Utah — a place where he said a fan made a racist taunt toward him four years ago, sparking an uproar — or accept a buyout after getting traded there by the Los Angeles Lakers and try to latch on with a playoff contender to finish the season.

            As long as he’s on another roster by March 1, he’d be playoff-eligible.

            There is a market for Westbrook. And there should be.

            “If there’s, you know, somebody out there,“ Clippers forward Paul George said a few days ago when asked about his team having an open roster spot.

            He paused for a couple of seconds and then said “Russell.” Hey, it’s not tampering if players talk about other players.

            “It would definitely improve our team if we had that traditional point guard, to kind of get us in things and make the game easy,” George said. “So, hopefully, Russell sees this and we figure something out.”

            The Clippers could use Westbrook. So could Chicago, where even Goran Dragic — the team’s backup point guard — knows the Bulls need help at that spot. So could Miami, where Kyle Lowry has been sidelined of late by knee soreness.

            George has a valid, reasonable argument when it comes to why he wants Westbrook on the Clippers. They have shooting. Shooting means spacing. Spacing means lanes to the basket. That’s where Westbrook thrives, getting to the rim, playing fast, driving-and-attacking or driving-and-kicking.

            The whole world, especially his many detractors, are very aware that Westbrook is not Stephen Curry from long range. Or Seth Curry. Or probably even Dell Curry at this point. He is not a knockdown shooter and never has been, so it’s puzzling why this is some sort of argument against Westbrook.

            At his best, Westbrook was a 34% 3-point shooter. On average, he's a 30% shooter from beyond the arc. This season, he's just under 30%.

            The $47 million salary for this season is another source of disdain, that someone averaging what Westbrook is averaging — and wasn’t even starting for a Lakers team that has spent the entire season outside of the play-in picture — isn’t playing up to the level of his paycheck. But he’s far from the only veteran in the NBA to have a bloated contract toward the end of the line, part of the final payoff for the deal that he earned when he was an All-NBA player, an MVP, a perennial star. He was paid what the market said he should be paid. And he is far from the only reason why the Lakers struggled in his year-plus with the team.

            “It's really unfair to put the last year and a half (on) one player,"" Lakers general manager Rob Pelinka said.

            The Clippers see an opportunity. The players in that locker room — and surely some in other locker rooms, too — are convinced that Westbrook would make them better.

            “He’s one of the greatest players that ever played the game,” Clippers forward Marcus Morris Sr. said.

            Look at the resume: nine All-Star appearances, part of the NBA’s 75th anniversary team, an MVP, two scoring titles, three assist titles, 198 triple-doubles. He has an edge, no question. He’s sometimes abrupt with reporters, particularly when he doesn’t like a question. He’s also the man who, quietly, left a massive tip for hotel staff inside the NBA’s restart bubble at Walt Disney World three years ago and urged other players to find ways to thank those people for making the bubble possible.

            It’s hard to find a team out there that couldn’t use another 15 points, six rebounds and seven assists per game right now. If the fit is right and a buyout happens, some team could get quite a late-season boost. 

            “Give him an opportunity to come back,"" Morris said, “and he could be dangerous.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810077,Qatar donates World Cup mobile homes to earthquake survivors,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Qatar plans to send 10,000 cabins and caravans from last year's World Cup to provide shelter for survivors of the Turkish earthquakes, officials said.

            The gas-rich Gulf nation says it had always planned to donate the mobile homes. They were needed to help house some of the 1.4 million fans who descended on the small country during soccer's biggest tournament.

            An initial batch of 350 structures was shipped out on Sunday, the Qatar Fund for Development said.











            The magnitude 7.8 and 7.5 quakes that struck nine hours apart on Feb. 6 killed more than 35,000 people in southeastern Turkey and war-torn northern Syria. The toll is expected to climb even further as search and rescue teams find more bodies.

            Tens of thousands of buildings were destroyed or severely damaged, leaving millions homeless. As shelters filled up in the days after the quake many were forced to sleep outside in wet, wintry weather.

            Qatar and other wealthy Gulf countries have joined the global effort to send rescuers and aid to the stricken region. The United Arab Emirates has pledged $100 million for relief efforts. Saudi Arabia has dispatched eight planes loaded with supplies to Turkey and Syria.

            The eighth Saudi flight landed in government-held Aleppo, in northern Syria, on Tuesday. Saudi Arabia was a strong supporter of the opposition at the height of Syria's civil war and — unlike other Arab countries — has shown little interest in any rapprochement with President Bashar Assad.DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Qatar plans to send 10,000 cabins and caravans from last year's World Cup to provide shelter for survivors of the Turkish earthquakes, officials said.The gas-rich Gulf nation says it had always planned to donate the mobile homes.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810078,DOJ giving states $231M for gun violence prevention programs,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Justice Department is sending out more than $200 million to help states and the District of Columbia administer “red-flag laws” and other crisis-intervention programs as part of the landmark bipartisan gun legislation passed by Congress over the summer, officials said Tuesday. 

            Red-flag laws, also known as extreme risk protection orders, are intended to temporarily remove guns from people with potentially violent behavior and prevent them from hurting themselves or others. Nineteen states and the District of Columbia have red-flag laws.

             “This funding will reduce gun violence and save lives,"" White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. 











            Some of the $231 million in funding announced Tuesday, the fifth anniversary of the deadly school shooting in Parkland, Florida, will also go to crisis-intervention court proceedings and other gun-violence reduction programs.

            Red-flag laws have been touted by President Joe Biden and others as a powerful tool to stop gun violence before it happens. But an Associated Press analysis found they are often underused even as shootings and gun deaths soar around the U.S. That can be due to a lack of awareness or reluctance to enforce the laws.

            The suspect in a mass shooting targeting an LGBT nightclub in Colorado Springs, Colorado, in November, for example, had allegedly threatened his mother with a homemade bomb a year and a half earlier, but there’s no public record that police or relatives tried to trigger Colorado’s law.

            The laws differ by state, but they generally allow people like family members or law enforcement to petition a court for an order removing weapons, for up to a year. Some critics fear they could be used to wrongly curtail Second Amendment rights. The Justice Department said the program has checks in place to ensure due process.

            The funding is part of the $1.4 billion from the legislation provided to the Justice Department over five years for gun violence prevention measures. 

            The legislation passed in June was the widest-ranging gun violence bill in decades. It toughened requirements for young people who seek to buy guns, denied firearms for more domestic abusers, and bolstered funding for mental health programs and schools.

            Attorney General Merrick Garland said the funding will “help protect children, families, and communities across the country from senseless acts of gun violence.”WASHINGTON (AP) — The Justice Department is sending out more than $200 million to help states and the District of Columbia administer “red-flag laws” and other crisis-intervention programs as part of the landmark bipartisan gun legislation passed by Congress over the summer, officials said Tuesday.Red-flag laws, also known as extreme risk protection orders, are intended to temporarily remove guns from people with potentially violent behavior and prevent them from hurting themselves or others.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810095,Evers wants to give Brewers nearly $300M to repair stadium,"MADISON, Wis. (AP) — Democratic Gov. Tony Evers wants to hand the Milwaukee Brewers nearly $300 million from Wisconsin's budget surplus to enact repairs and renovations at American Family Field.

            The governor's office announced Tuesday that his executive budget will include $290 million from the surplus for stadium repairs. In exchange for the money, the Brewers have agreed to extend their lease at the stadium by 13 years through 2043, the administration and the team said.

            “As governor, and also someone who happens to be a lifelong Brewers fan, I'm so excited about the historic opportunity we have today to keep Major League Baseball here in Milwaukee for another twenty years and to usher in a new generation of Brewers fans in Wisconsin who can grow up rooting for the home team just like I did,” Evers said in a statement.











            The agreement is far from a done deal, however. Evers is set to release his full 2023-25 budget on Wednesday. Republicans on the Legislature's powerful finance committee will spend the next four months revising it before sending to the full Senate and Assembly for approval. From there, the spending plan goes back to Evers, who can rewrite it using his powerful partial veto powers.

            Assembly Speaker Robin Vos said Tuesday he was upset that Evers didn't consult Republicans or work with the Legislature on plans to fund the stadium. “These are typical antics for him not being a leader, but rather dictating exactly what to do and how to do it,” Vos said.

            Vos said he hoped Democrats and Republicans could work together to keep the Brewers in Wisconsin.

            The money for the stadium repairs would be a one-time cash payment from the state surplus, which currently stands at around $7 billion. But the proposal is sure to rekindle old arguments over whether privately owned sports teams deserve public handouts to continue operating — especially the Brewers, who have benefited immensely from a sales tax that helped build the stadium.

            Rick Schlesinger, the Brewers' president of business operations, said in a statement that the stadium has had a $2.5 billion impact on the state's economy since it opened in 2001 and contributes millions of dollars each year in tax revenue to the state. 

            “The Milwaukee Brewers are committed to working with policymakers on both sides of the aisle to extend the life of American Family Field and help make Major League Baseball possible in Wisconsin for the next generation,” Schlesinger said. “As the smallest market as defined by the MLB, Milwaukee requires a premier ballpark to generate ticket sales and compete — making maintenance of the ballpark all the more critical.”

            The stadium opened in 2001 as Miller Park, replacing the Milwaukee's aging County Stadium. The construction price tag was about $392 million, funded largely through a 0.1% sales tax imposed in Milwaukee County and the four other counties surrounding the stadium. 

            Construction got off to a tough start. The tax was a lightning rod for criticism; Republican state Sen. George Petak was recalled from office in 1996 after he switched his vote from no to yes on the tax plan. And three construction workers were killed at the stadium in 1999 when a crane collapsed and struck their observation lift.

            But the park ultimately got built. Known for its distinctive fantail retractable roof, the stadium became a destination for Wisconsin baseball fans as the Brewers experienced a resurgence in the late 2000s, advancing to their first playoff appearance in 26 years in 2008. The team has made five other trips to the playoffs since then, including two appearances in the National League Championship Series.

            The tax was ultimately enacted that year and generated about $605 million before it expired in 2020. The stadium name changed to American Family Field in 2021 after the Brewers struck a 15-year naming rights deal with the insurance company.

            The Southeast Wisconsin Professional Baseball Park District essentially serves as the Brewers' landlord at the stadium. The Brewers' lease calls for the district to cover repairs, but Evers' office said the end of the sales tax has left the district short of funds, according to the governor's office and the Brewers.

            “We oppose the return of the five-county tax, and we are prepared to commit to a lease extension for the Brewers to remain at American Family Field through at least 2042,” the Brewers' Schlesinger said.

            Evers' office said the $290 million payment will go to the district, which will invest the money and collect interest on it as it disburses funds to cover repairs.

            Former Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican, signed a bill in August 2015 to contribute $250 million in taxpayer dollars to help pay for the Fiserv Forum, the Milwaukee Bucks' arena. Brown County residents approved a half-cent sales tax in 2000 to help pay for renovations at Lambeau Field, home of the Green Bay Packers. That tax expired in 2015 after generating about $310 million.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810096,Liverpool urges UEFA to ensure fans are safe at matches,"Liverpool urged European soccer’s governing body to ensure supporter safety is the top priority at matches after a report detailed how a “mass fatality catastrophe” was only narrowly avoided at last year’s Champions League final involving the English team.

            Liverpool said it welcomed the findings of an investigation panel which exonerated the club’s fans from any blame amid chaotic scenes that saw tens of thousands of supporters — including elderly people and kids — held in increasingly crushed lines for hours before biggest match in European soccer, which was held at the 75,000-capacity Stade de France.

            UEFA had initially blamed Liverpool fans, some of whom were fired on by tear gas by police, for arriving at the stadium late and using fake tickets to try to gain entry.











            Ultimately, the report found UEFA should bear “primary responsibility for failures which almost led to disaster,” which — for many Liverpool fans — had chilling echoes of the tragedy at Hillsborough Stadium in 1989 that led to the death of 97 supporters of the club. Security issues also marred the UEFA-run European Championship final at Wembley Stadium 10 months ago.

            “We call on UEFA and others at the top of the football regulation pyramid to come together and take positive and transparent action to ensure there are no more ‘near misses,’” Liverpool said.

            “We implore UEFA to fully enact the recommendations as outlined by the panel — no matter how difficult — to ensure supporter safety is the number one priority at the heart of every UEFA football fixture.”

            Liverpool said it was “shocking” that its fans were subject to such “fundamental safety failings which have had such a devastating impact on so many,” particularly in light of what happened at Hillsborough.

            “Paris has only exacerbated their suffering,” the club said.

            Liverpool chief executive Billy Hogan said the publishing of the panel's findings marked “the end of the beginning” of the changes needed to be carried by authorities.

            “This is where the hard work really needs to start now,” he said. “Again, the sense of pride that we have from the behavior of our supporters — the fact that it wasn’t (a) disaster, which is really down to the behavior of our supporters around the match itself — but now we need to look at how we make sure that nothing like this happens again.”

            UEFA has pledged to launch a special refund scheme for fans, and a law firm representing more than 600 Liverpool supporters injured or traumatized by the events at the Stade de France said Tuesday it is pushing forward with a legal claim against the governing body.

            Leigh Day said it is making the claim on the basis that UEFA “failed to ensure a safe and secure environment for those attending and could owe a legal liability to those who suffered physical and/or psychological injuries.”

            Spirit of Shankly, a Liverpool supporters’ group, also welcomed the panel’s findings that the club’s fans were not responsible for the chaos.

            “A breakdown in communication on the day, the failures of UEFA, the French police and authorities were to blame,” the group said. “The shame — beginning with the stadium billboard announcing kickoff was delayed due to fans arriving late, supporters being tear gassed and pepper sprayed, pickpocketed and attacked, people frightened they were going to die — is on them.”

            More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsLiverpool urged European soccer’s governing body to ensure supporter safety is the top priority at matches after a report detailed how a “mass fatality catastrophe” was only narrowly avoided at last year’s Champions League final involving the English team.Liverpool said it welcomed the findings of an investigation panel which exonerated the club’s fans from any blame amid chaotic scenes that saw tens of thousands of supporters — including elderly people and kids — held in increasingly crushed lines for hours before biggest match in European soccer, which was held at the 75,000-capacity Stade de France.UEFA had initially blamed Liverpool fans, some of whom were fired on by tear gas by police, for arriving at the stadium late and using fake tickets to try to gain entry.Ultimately, the report found UEFA should bear “primary responsibility for failures which almost led to disaster,” which — for many Liverpool fans — had chilling echoes of the tragedy at Hillsborough Stadium in 1989 that led to the death of 97 supporters of the club. Security issues also marred the UEFA-run European Championship final at Wembley Stadium 10 months ago.“We call on UEFA and others at the top of the football regulation pyramid to come together and take positive and transparent action to ensure there are no more ‘near misses,’” Liverpool said.“We implore UEFA to fully enact the recommendations as outlined by the panel — no matter how difficult — to ensure supporter safety is the number one priority at the heart of every UEFA football fixture.”Liverpool said it was “shocking” that its fans were subject to such “fundamental safety failings which have had such a devastating impact on so many,” particularly in light of what happened at Hillsborough.“Paris has only exacerbated their suffering,” the club said.Liverpool chief executive Billy Hogan said the publishing of the panel's findings marked “the end of the beginning” of the changes needed to be carried by authorities.“This is where the hard work really needs to start now,” he said. “Again, the sense of pride that we have from the behavior of our supporters — the fact that it wasn’t (a) disaster, which is really down to the behavior of our supporters around the match itself — but now we need to look at how we make sure that nothing like this happens again.”UEFA has pledged to launch a special refund scheme for fans, and a law firm representing more than 600 Liverpool supporters injured or traumatized by the events at the Stade de France said Tuesday it is pushing forward with a legal claim against the governing body.Leigh Day said it is making the claim on the basis that UEFA “failed to ensure a safe and secure environment for those attending and could owe a legal liability to those who suffered physical and/or psychological injuries.”Spirit of Shankly, a Liverpool supporters’ group, also welcomed the panel’s findings that the club’s fans were not responsible for the chaos.“A breakdown in communication on the day, the failures of UEFA, the French police and authorities were to blame,” the group said. “The shame — beginning with the stadium billboard announcing kickoff was delayed due to fans arriving late, supporters being tear gassed and pepper sprayed, pickpocketed and attacked, people frightened they were going to die — is on them.”___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/02/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810097,Russia denies claims it plans to destabilize Moldova,"MOSCOW (AP) — Russia on Tuesday angrily rejected the Moldovan president's claims about an alleged plot by Moscow to overthrow her government and accused Moldovan authorities of trying to distract public attention away from the country's own domestic problems.

            
                Moldova’s President Maia Sandu said Monday that the purported Russian plot envisioned attacks on government buildings, hostage-takings and other violent actions by groups of saboteurs in order to put the nation “at the disposal of Russia” and derail its hopes to join the European Union.

            Responding Tuesday, Russia's Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova dismissed Sandu's claims as “absolutely unfounded and unsubstantiated.”











            “They are built in the spirit of classical techniques that are often used by the United States, other Western countries and Ukraine,"" Zakharova said. ""First, accusations are made with reference to purportedly classified intelligence information that cannot be verified, and then they are used to justify their own illegal actions.”

            Sandu’s claim came a week after neighboring Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his country had intercepted plans by Russian secret services to destroy Moldova. Moldovan intelligence officials later said that they confirmed the allegations.

            Zakharova charged that Ukrainian authorities made up the claim about a purported Russian plan to destabilize Moldova in order to draw it into a confrontation with Russia. She argued that Moldovan authorities used “the myth about a Russian threat to distract Moldovan citizens' attention from internal problems resulting from a disastrous social-economic course of the current administration and to step up the fight against dissent and political opponents.”

            Zakharova insisted that Russia poses no threat to Moldova and hopes to develop mutually beneficial cooperation. 

            Since Russian troops rolled into Ukraine nearly a year ago, Moldova, a former Soviet republic of about 2.6 million people, has sought to forge closer ties with its Western partners. Last June, it was granted EU membership candidate status, the same day as Ukraine.

            In December, Moldova’s national intelligence agency warned that Russia could launch a new offensive with the aim of creating a land corridor through southern Ukraine to Moldova’s Moscow-backed breakaway region of Transnistria.

            Transnistria broke away after a 1992 civil war but is not recognized by most countries. It extends roughly 400 kilometers (250 miles) from the eastern bank of the Dniester River to the country’s border with Ukraine. Russia has about 1,500 troops nominally as “peacekeepers” in the breakaway region.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810098,Red Sox ballpark turns back to baseball after busy winter,"BOSTON (AP) — The hockey rink has been removed. The goalposts are gone. The obstacle course and driving range tees also were taken away to get Fenway Park ready for baseball again.

            Even without Red Sox playoffs, the major league's oldest ballpark is coming off one of the busiest winters in its 110-year history. The debut of college football's Fenway Bowl and the NHL’s Winter Classic were the most visible events, but fans have been spinning the turnstiles all offseason.

            “Baseball is obviously the core part of our business, but we’ve got this amazing venue that is world-renowned,” said Mark Lev, president of Fenway Sports Management, which includes booking the ballpark in its portfolio.











            “The ability to take advantage of that, to attract other world-class events is definitely what we want to do,"" he said. “We want to make Fenway a multi-use, versatile, year-round entertainment venue.”

            The Red Sox opened Fenway in 1912 — the same week the Titanic sank — and almost from the start they put it to use for other events. It hosted boxing, soccer and hockey in its first decade, and the forerunners of the NFL’s Washington Commanders and New England Patriots both called the ballpark home at one point.

            “It was really a community resource,” Lev said in a recent interview from one of Fenway's newest function rooms overlooking the field.

            But the schedule got much busier after the baseball team’s current owners took over in 2002.

            Bruce Springsteen played Updike’s “lyric, little ballpark” in 2003; the concert count is now 100. European soccer friendlies followed, along with ski jumping, “Crashed Ice” ice skating racing, movie nights and Shakespeare in the park.

            Fenway has hosted the Winter Classic twice, and the Fenway Bowl made its debut in December after twice being canceled because of the COVID-19 pandemic. With the football field set up, local high schools also got a chance to play on the historic sod. When the hockey rink moved in for the Jan. 2 NHL game, a slate of college and high school matchups was scheduled.

            Also stopping by the park this offseason were Top Golf and the Spartan Race. In all, the offseason events brought more than 120,000 fans into the ballpark this winter — and that's not even counting the tours that run year-round.

            “I think this year was our busiest offseason ever,” Lev said.

            The additional events bring in some revenue — though it’s not going to overtake the money earned from the baseball season, Lev said — and also help the Fenway brand. The 2008 Irish hurling matches were broadcast internationally, and events such as skiing bring the ballpark to a different crowd than the baseball fans who see it as the venerable home of the Red Sox.

            “It’s just great exposure for the ballpark,” he said. “It allows us to attract new audiences that might not otherwise come to Fenway to enjoy Fenway, have the Fenway Park experience, which hopefully will bring them back for other events.”

            The other events also bring in tourists to the city, and customers for the souvenir stands and restaurants in the neighborhood. “So it checks a lot of boxes for us,” Lev said.

            On a recent weekday, workers were taking apart the hockey rink where the Bruins had played the Pittsburgh Penguins, while the ballpark’s lights were being lowered to the field by cranes for a scheduled LED upgrade. Jackhammers echoed through the empty seating bowl.

            Cases of beer, water and Pepsi were strewn about the function room, along with equipment left over from the Winter Classic. The Green Monster in left field had been painted over, awaiting the ads that will be shown during the coming baseball season.

            Janet Marie Smith, the architect who spearheaded the Fenway renovations that have made the ancillary events possible, said using the ballpark for more than the 81-game home Red Sox schedule “just seems like the natural and responsible thing to do.”

            “When you occupy a place — physically, in the middle of a robust city, and spiritually, in the hearts and minds of the citizens of that community — that to shutter your building just is crazy,” Smith said, adding the philosophy dates back to the late 1980s with the creation of Baltimore’s Camden Yards, which sparked a new era of ballpark construction.

            “It was a feeling that there was a civic responsibility,” she said. “That if you were in the middle of a town, particularly a downtown, that you owed it to the people who lived and worked there to be a part of that year-round community.”

            Make no mistake, Lev said: At Fenway, baseball is still king. 

            Nothing is booked for October, to make sure the ballpark is available for potential Red Sox playoff games. And the offseason events end in mid-January, to give groundskeeper Dave Mellor — “our most valuable player,” Lev said — time to get the diamond in shape for the ballclub’s March 30 opening day.

            “Before we do anything, he’s part of every conversation to make sure that we’re not doing anything that’s going to compromise the field,” Lev said.

            “We need to make sure we leave time for the groundskeeper to do his thing,” he said. “Baseball is the priority, and maintaining the pristine field conditions is always paramount to any decision we make on any event that we have at the ballpark.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810099,PICK SIX: Impact transfers paying dividends at contenders,"Free agency has come to college basketball with the NCAA's determination that transfers need not sit out a year before playing.

            That has given programs with holes to fill access to players to fill those holes, but not all of them work out. Here are six that have, based not only on their production but the team's clear benefit:

            MARK SEARS, 6-foot-1, 185 pounds, junior, No. 1 Alabama











            He averaged 19.6 points at Ohio last season and is at 14.0 for the Crimson Tide. That’s good for second on a team he leads with 39 steals. Sims also is second with 53 3-pointers, which has been a key area of improvement for the Crimson Tide after they finished 300th in the nation in 3-point percentage last season, making just 30.9%.

            Sears has had several big outbursts (7 of 11 3-pointers, 24 points against North Carolina), 26 points against Arkansas and a 19-point, 4 of 6 3-point performance last week in a 97-69 win against Florida.

            “He’s been aggressive,” Alabama coach Nate Oats said after the Florida win. “We need him. ... He makes our offense go and he’s able to play some point, too. Sears can also attack the rim. He’s aggressive, gets fouled frequently because he’s a tough, physical, downhill guard.

            “But when he’s making shots like he is, he’s tough to guard.”

            
                Alabama rose to No. 1 this week for the first time in 20 years.

            SOULEY BOUM, 6-3, 175, graduate student, No. 16 Xavier

            A graduate transfer, Boum averages better than 16 points and leads the Musketeers (19-6) in 3-pointers (48), assists and minutes played after moving from UTEP. Boum scored nearly 20 per game last season.

            He led the Musketeers with 26 points in a 90-87 victory against Creighton and added five rebounds, eight assists and three blocks.

            “To play in a game that fast and have zero turnovers, is really hard to do,” Xavier coach Sean Miller said. “He’s playing like an All-American.”

            CAM SPENCER, 6-4, 207, senior, Rutgers

            His 18.9 scoring average at Loyola Maryland likely convinced him he'd undersold himself, and his transfer has proven it. He's averaging 12.9 points, second among Scarlet Knights, with a team-high 49 3-pointers, and has another year of eligibility if he chooses to use it.

            Spencer etched his name into Scarlet Knights lore on Jan. 2, capping a 14-point performance by hitting a 3-pointer with 13.3 seconds left to give Rutgers a 65-64 victory over top-ranked and unbeaten Purdue.

            “He’s been a great addition to our program,” coach Steve Pikiell said. “He’s a great kid from a great family. He’s the whole package.”

            MORRIS UDEZE, 6-8, 240, graduate student, New Mexico

            He’s third on the Lobos with an average of 15.4 points on 59.5% shooting and leads them in rebounding (8.7). At Wichita State last year, he averaged 10.2 points and 6.9 rebounds per game.

            Needing a veteran center, “we were able to target Morris and he’s been great,” coach Richard Pitino said. “Besides the fact that he’s a really good player, he’s a winner. He is a relentless worker. He’s tough, and he’s a huge reason why we’ve been able to turn this around.”

            BAYLOR SCHEIERMAN, 6-7, 2-0, senior, No. 18 Creighton

            His scoring has dropped from 16.2 ppg at South Dakota State to 13.3 ppg, but he’s shooting nearly 40% from 3-point range with a team-best 63 3s and leads the Blue Jays (17-8) with 8.3 rebounds per game.

            KENDRIC DAVIS, 6-0, 177, graduate student, Memphis

            A top scorer last season at SMU (19.4), he's been even better for the Tigers, ranking seventh nationally at 21.8 per game. He also leads Memphis (19-6) with 41 3-pointers, 51 steals and 6.1 assists per game.

            The former American Athletic Conference player of the year had 25 points, 11 assists and seven rebounds when the Tigers beat SMU on Jan. 26.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810100,California will try to enshrine right to same-sex marriage,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California, a U.S. trendsetter for progressive policies and a state where the current governor once made news issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples in San Francisco before it was legal, will attempt to enshrine marriage equality in the state constitution. 

            The effort comes 15 years after a voter-approved initiative, Proposition 8, banned the state from recognizing same-sex marriages. In 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way for same-sex marriage in California. The constitutional amendment is still on the books, however, and that worries advocates who think the high court may revisit the 2015 case that legalized gay marriage nationwide. 

            “It’s absolute poison, it is so destructive and it’s humiliating that this is in our constitution,” said Scott Wiener, a state senator who represents San Francisco. 











            Wiener and Assembly Member Evan Low of Silicon Valley, both Democrats and members of the California Legislative LGBTQ Caucus, introduced legislation Tuesday to rescind Proposition 8. The measure would need to be approved in the Legislature by a two-thirds vote, and then it will ultimately fall to voters to decide via a referendum.

            Gov. Gavin Newsom announced his support for the repeal.

            “It’s time that our laws affirm marriage equality regardless of who you are or who you love,"" the Democrat said. ""California stands with the LGBTQ+ community and their right to live freely.” 

            In the days leading up to Proposition 8′s approval, Low joined opponents of the measure outside his alma mater De Anza College in Cupertino, California, to call on voters to reject the initiative. When it passed, it felt personal to Low, who is gay.

            “Why do fellow Californians hate me?” he said. “Why do they feel that my rights should be eliminated?”

            California could follow in the footsteps of Nevada, which in 2020 became the first state to amend its constitution to ensure the right to same-sex marriage. The matter took on fresh urgency last year when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the right to an abortion established by Roe v. Wade. At the time, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas called into question other prominent cases and urged the court to reconsider them. His list included Obergefell v. Hodges, which forced states to issue and recognize same-sex marriages.

            ""In future cases, we should reconsider all of this Court’s substantive due process precedents, including Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell,"" Thomas wrote, referencing two other landmark cases involving access to birth control and a decision striking down laws against same-sex sexual activity. 

            In December, President Joe Biden signed into law the Respect for Marriage Act, which requires states to recognize same-sex marriages, but the legislation doesn’t force states to allow them if Obergefell is overturned.

            Wiener and Low, the two California lawmakers, hope to replicate the process under which state voters in November approved a constitutional change guaranteeing the right to abortion.

            Jeremy Yancey and Fabio de Andrade, who got married Tuesday at a Valentine's Day celebration at San Francisco City Hall, said Proposition 8's repeal is overdue. 

            “It's about time. Protecting our rights as human beings is very vital,” Yancey said. “It should've happened many years ago.”

            Assembly Member Greg Wallis, a Republican representing part of San Bernadino County, said in a statement that he was proud to co-author the legislation.

            “The reality is that marriage is a contract and commitment between any two people in love, and it's high time we make that clear,” Wallis said.

            The path to marriage equality in the Golden State was uneven. In 2000, voters approved a statute that banned the recognition of same-sex marriages, a measure that was overturned by the courts. Newsom, who became San Francisco's mayor in 2004, issued marriage licenses to same-sex couples in the city in a move that defied the law and ran counter to views then held by many in his party. In 2005, the California Legislature was ahead of all other states when it passed a bill to legalize same-sex marriage. But then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, vetoed it. 

            Support for marriage equality has rapidly expanded since the Obergefell ruling. While Mormon groups helped fund the Proposition 8 campaign in California, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints came out in support of the Respect for Marriage Act. 

            Tony Hoang, executive director of Equality California, is optimistic the group can help build a large supportive coalition for the proposed amendment. 

            “I know this will be a bipartisan campaign,” he said.

(AP) — California, a U.S. trendsetter for progressive policies and a state where the current governor once made news issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples in San Francisco before it was legal, will attempt to enshrine marriage equality in the state constitution.The effort comes 15 years after a voter-approved initiative, Proposition 8, banned the state from recognizing same-sex marriages. In 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way for same-sex marriage in California. The constitutional amendment is still on the books, however, and that worries advocates who think the high court may revisit the 2015 case that legalized gay marriage nationwide.“It’s absolute poison, it is so destructive and it’s humiliating that this is in our constitution,” said Scott Wiener, a state senator who represents San Francisco.Wiener and Assembly Member Evan Low of Silicon Valley, both Democrats and members of the California Legislative LGBTQ Caucus, introduced legislation Tuesday to rescind Proposition 8.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810101,Big week in the Big East for conference race,"It will be a big week in the Big East.

            The conference's top four teams are within 1 1/2 games of each other with three weeks left in the regular season and two big games could help spread things out a bit.

            The first is Tuesday, when No. 18 Creighton plays at No. 24 Providence.











            At 11-3, the Bluejays (17-8) are a half-game behind Big East-leading Marquette. Creighton has won eight straight since losing to No. 16 Xavier and had one of the biggest jumps in this week's AP Top 25, climbing five places after beating Seton Hall and No. 20 UConn.

            The Friars (18-7) are 10-4 in Big East play, but dropped four spots in this week's poll thanks to a road loss to St. John's last Saturday.

            Creighton won the first meeting 73-67 after blowing a 16-point lead, but that game was in Omaha. The Bluejays play St. John's and Providence goes against Villanova on Saturday.

            The following night, No. 11 Marquette (20-6, 12-3 Big East) faces a stiff test at No. 16 Xavier.

            The Golden Eagles lost a chance to extend their conference lead with a 15-point loss to No. 20 UConn last week, but bounced back with a win over Georgetown.

            The Musketeers (19-6, 11-3) are coming off a two-point loss to Butler that dropped them a spot in this week's poll. Xavier won the first meeting 80-76 at home in a game that went back and forth most of the afternoon.

            The Musketeers host DePaul on Saturday and Marquette doesn't play again until facing Creighton next Tuesday.

            BIG 12 BATTLES

            The Big 12 race has an even larger gathering at the top in the hunt for the regular-season title, six teams all within two games of each other.

            The marquee game this week will be No. 5 Kansas at No. 9 Baylor on Saturday.

            The past two national champions met on Jan. 23 when the Jayhawks were struggling. Baylor won that game 75-69 in Waco to send Kansas to its first three-game losing streak in 20 seasons under coach Bill Self.

            The Jayhawks (20-5) have won four of five since to remain in the Big 12 hunt at 8-4, with a game at Oklahoma on Tuesday.

            Baylor (20-6) moved to 9-4 in conference play with a 79-67 win over West Virginia on Monday night, pulling the Bears into a tie at the top of the standings after No. 6 Texas lost 74-67 to Texas Tech.

            No. 19 Iowa State (16-8, 7-5 Big 12) faces two ranked opponents this week, playing home games against No. 22 TCU on Wednesday and No. 12 Kansas State on Saturday.

            The Cyclones beat the Horned Frogs 69-67 Jan. 7 in Fort Worth when Gabe Kalscheur hit a 3-pointer with 1.3 seconds left. Iowa State also has a road win over Kansas State, pulling out an 70-76 victory on Jan. 24.

            ALABAMA BASKETBALL

            Alabama is showing that it's not just a football school.

            The Crimson Tide moved to No. 1 in the AP Top 25 for the first time in 20 years in this week's poll. With the football team earning a top ranking in the fall, Alabama is the first school to have its football and basketball teams ranked No. 1 in the same season since Ohio State in 2010-11.

            The Crimson Tide face a tough first test in their return to No. 1, playing at No. 10 Tennessee on Wednesday.

            The Vols will not only have the addition motivation of facing the country's top-ranked team, they're looking to get back on track after consecutive losses to Vanderbilt and Missouri.

            Their matchup will be strength vs. strength.

            Tennessee has the nation's third-best scoring defense, allowing 56.3 points per game. Alabama scores 83.4 points per game, sixth nationally.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810102,Analysis: NFL skids into offseason after slippery Super Bowl,"Gratitude and brotherhood were on display at the Super Bowl, where Travis and Jason Kelce tussled for the Lombardi Trophy in a classic back-and-forth clash and Damar Hamlin received a rousing ovation during a pregame ceremony honoring the men and women who saved his life.

            The feel-good vibes didn't last as long as the NFL would have liked, however.

            After the NBA encroached on the NFL's biggest week by moving its trade deadline from late March to smack dab in the middle of Super Bowl week, the Kansas City Chiefs rallied past the Philadelphia Eagles 38-35 after the game took on the flavors of both MLB and the NHL.











            The NFL's biggest stage looked too much like a hockey rink when State Farm Stadium lived up to its reputation of slippery fields with players from both teams having a hard time keeping their footing.

            The waxy grass neutralized the vaunted pass rush for both teams, helping Patrick Mahomes and Jalen Hurts rack up points like pinball wizards at a vintage arcade.

            Yet, just days after NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell declared the league's officiating better than ever, a debatable holding call just after the two-minute warning ensured there would be no chance for a fantastic finish to an otherwise scintillating Super Bowl 57.

            The flag — just the ninth penalty of the game — was akin to an umpire suddenly expanding his strike zone in the ninth inning, and it drew condemnation far and wide.

            The Chiefs faced third-and-8 at the Eagles 15-yard line with 1:54 remaining when Mahomes threw incomplete to JuJu Smith-Schuster. But officials flagged James Bradberry for defensive holding, which negated the incompletion and, more importantly, gave the Chiefs a first down.

            Replays showed that Bradberry made light contact with Smith-Schuster, though it didn’t appear to affect the play that much.

            Referee Carl Cheffers said it was a “clear case of a jersey grab"" and added that nobody on his crew disagreed with the penalty.

            There was plenty of bickering from fans and commentators. Former NFL tight end Greg Olsen wasn’t happy with the decision on the Fox broadcast and ESPN and Amazon analyst Kirk Herbstreit also was critical on social media, as were several current and former NFL players.

            ESPN commentator and former NFL QB Tim Hasselbeck said it's too much to ask officials to suddenly swallow their whistles in crucial moments because fans want to see a more climactic ending to the Super Bowl.

            “That to me, in a regular-season game on third-and-7, that's a flag. I don't want the officials calling it any differently because it's a tie game in the Super Bowl,” Hasselbeck said. ""The job is hard enough. Let's not have them all of a sudden call it differently based on, 'Hey it's a tie game, everyone at home would like a close one.”'

            Kansas City was able to essentially run out the clock after the flag, giving coach Andy Reid his second Super Bowl title, this one against the team that once fired him after he couldn't win the big one in Philadelphia.

            After Harrison Butker kicked a 27-yard field goal with 8 seconds remaining, the Eagles got the ball back with only the chance for a desperation heave from Hurts that didn't get anywhere near the end zone.

            Despite all the consternation surrounding what many considered a ticky-tack flag, Bradberry acknowledged he committed a penalty on the pivotal play.

            “It was a holding,” Bradberry said. “I tugged his jersey. I was hoping they would let it slide.”

            Sliding was the theme of the afternoon, after all.

            The Eagles' pass rushers didn't record a single sack in the Super Bowl after piling up an incredible 78 sacks on the season, including 10 in the playoffs. Hurts and Eagles tight end Dallas Goedert were among the players who changed their cleats at halftime to get better traction.

            “It’s not like we were playing on the on ice and they were playing on grass,” Eagles coach Nick Sirianni said. “We all had to play on it, we all have to figure out our shoes.”

            Indeed, the Chiefs were just as bothered by the slippery field.

            Mahomes slipped while trying to make a cut, receiver Skyy Moore lost his footing on a jet sweep and both running back Isiah Pacheco and tight end Travis Kelce slipped during touchdown celebrations.

            The grass at State Farm Stadium is on a giant tray that is rolled in and out of the retractable-roof stadium. The field sits out in the Arizona sun on warm days and is brought back inside when it gets cold.

            The Chiefs also had problems with the field in their season opener against the Arizona Cardinals at State Farm Stadium when first-round pick Trent McDuffie tore a hamstring and went on IR and Butker got hurt.

            This time, they kept their footing enough to pull out another 10-point second-half Super Bowl comeback.

            While Mahomes and Travis Kelce and Pacheco and Chris Jones were still celebrating in the confetti, running back Melvin Gordon, who never suited up for the Chiefs after signing with Kansas City's practice squad following his midseason departure from Denver, tweeted: ""talk about a long year ... y'all gave me something to smile about. Forever grateful. I'm a champion.”

            True, but it was like a kid signing his name to a group project just before it got turned in and getting full credit like his classmates who did all the work.

            Somehow that seemed like a fitting end to a Super Bowl Sunday equally filled with cringe-worthy points and memorable moments.

            Stewart, a three-time NASCAR Cup Series champion, will run a Top Alcohol Dragster for McPhillips Racing for the full 2023 NHRA season. Stewart, who turns 52 in May, will be sponsored by longtime partner Mobil 1.

            Stewart made his NHRA debut in a Top Alcohol Dragster last October at the Nevada Nationals, where he advanced to the finals and finished second by .0002-of a second. Stewart’s 5.258-second, 271.57 mph run in the finals came up just one inch short of the win.











            Stewart, who owns a sprint car team and is co-owner of Stewart-Haas Racing in NASCAR, last year started an NHRA team that fields one dragster in Top Fuel for his wife, Leah Pruett, and Funny Car for Matt Hagan.

            “We’ve been working on putting this package together with the McPhillips family to expand on what we did at Las Vegas last year and get back in the seat,"" Stewart said. “I want to keep learning about the sport and have the opportunity to go compete more this year with a team I really enjoy.

            ""It’s nerve-wracking to try and do something different, but when you have a team like what the McPhillips Racing team has, it makes everything a lot easier.”

            Stewart, who also has won championships in IndyCar and USAC, will be competing for the NHRA National Championship this year. Top Alcohol drivers are eligible to earn points at their first 10 national events. Their best six national finishes from their eligible points-earning events will constitute their championship points total.

            Stewart isn't sure a title is in reach. 

            “It’s hard to sit there and know what expectations we should have for the year,” Stewart said. “I think as long as I keep learning more and more as I go by trying to be more consistent with driving the car, keep it in the groove, trying to stay consistent on reaction times and improve reaction times, those are all goals for me. I want to keep learning and get better every weekend and every race we go to.”

            Stewart's first race as a full-time drag racer will be the Gatornationals in Gainesville, Florida, next month. In addition to the NHRA national events, Stewart will compete in select races in the Divisional Series, starting with the Baby Gators at Gainesville Raceway from March 1-5.

            “It’s been like being a little kid all over again,” Stewart said. “When I was racing go karts, I couldn’t wait for the winter to be over so I could go racing. That’s where I’m at all over again.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810128,"NATO chief unfazed if Finland, Sweden join separately","BRUSSELS (AP) — NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg played down on Tuesday the importance of Finland and Sweden joining the world’s biggest security organization at the same time as Turkey refuses to ratify their membership, mostly due to a dispute with Sweden.

            “The main question is not whether Finland and Sweden are ratified together. The main question is that they are both ratified as full members as soon as possible,” Stoltenberg told reporters. The long-held consensus at NATO has been that both the Nordic neighbors should join at the same time.

            Sweden and neighboring Finland abandoned decades of nonalignment and applied to join the 30-nation alliance in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. All NATO members except Turkey and Hungary have ratified their accession, but unanimity is required.











            Turkey has accused the government in Stockholm of being too lenient toward groups it deems as terror organizations or existential threats, including Kurdish groups. Earlier this month, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Ankara has fewer problems with Finland joining.

            He stressed, however, that it was up to the military alliance to decide whether to accept one country only or the Nordic duo together. So far, Finland has stood by Sweden and insisted they should join NATO’s ranks together.

            Stoltenberg said that he is “confident that both will be full members and are working hard to get both ratified as soon as possible.” It had been hoped that both countries would be welcomed in at NATO’s next summit in Lithuania in July.

            Turkey was rocked last week by a devastating earthquake and aftershocks that killed more than 35,000 people in the country and neighboring Syria.

            “We are all horrified by the terrible toll caused by the earthquakes” in Turkey, Stoltenberg said, adding that NATO allies are providing emergency support to the huge rescue and recovery operation.

            Turkey is in an election year, and the topic of Nordic membership of NATO is a possible vote winner. In recent weeks, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has expressed anger at a series of separate demonstrations in Stockholm. In one case a solitary anti-Islam activist burned the Quran outside the Turkish Embassy, while in an unconnected protest an effigy of Erdogan was hanged.

            In Stockholm, Swedish Foreign Minister Tobias Billström said he could see no reason why Turkey should continue to object, but that “it is a question of a Turkish decision which neither Sweden nor Finland can influence.”

            Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said it would be “unfortunate” if Finland entered NATO first, the Swedish news agency TT reported.

            Of the two countries, only Finland shares a border with Russia and would appear to be more at risk should President Vladimir Putin decide to target his neighbor. That said, some NATO allies, led by the United States, have offered security guarantees to both should they come under threat.

            Hungary has pushed back its ratification date for both countries three times so far but has not publicly raised any substantial objections to either of them joining.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810129,"Toyota founder's son, who led global growth, dies at 97","TOKYO (AP) — Shoichiro Toyoda, who as a son of the company’s founder oversaw Toyota’s expansion into international markets, has died. He was 97. 

            Toyoda, the company's honorary chairman, died Tuesday of heart failure, Toyota Motor Corp. said in a statement. 

            He was the father of Akio Toyoda, who recently announced he was stepping down as president and chief executive to become its chairman. Shoichiro was the eldest son of Kiichiro Toyoda, who founded Toyota in 1937. 











            After becoming Toyota's president in 1982, Shoichiro Toyoda helped direct Toyota’s transformation into a global automaker, especially in the vital U.S. market, where its brand became synonymous with quality, durability, cost performance and engineering finesse. 

            Both father and son experienced the difficult years of “Japan-bashing,” when powerful Japanese exporters like Toyota were blamed for taking away American blue-collar jobs. 

            The company opted to become a member of the U.S. auto community, showing that Toyota was an asset, creating jobs and value for the American people. 

            With his brother Tatsuro, Shoichiro Toyoda helped pave the way for Toyota to set up manufacturing facilities in North America. The company formed a joint venture with General Motors in 1983. It was called New United Motor Manufacturing Inc., or NUMMI, and its first vehicle rolled out in 1984 in Freemont, California. 

            The company relied on the founding family's legacy and historical charisma to tide it through times of crisis, although Toyota has had many chief executives who were not members of its founding family. 

            Shoichiro Toyoda was inducted into the U.S. Automotive Hall of Fame in 2007, honored for his achievements in cementing “Toyota’s reputation as one of the most recognized and celebrated auto manufacturers in the world.”

            He was graduated from the prestigious Nagoya University in 1947 with a degree in engineering and joined Toyota in 1952. 

            It’s said that he earned the respect of fellow employees by working right beside them in factories. That underscored Toyota’s vision of valuing the workplace, what’s on the ground, or “genba,” as critical for morale, efficient production, innovation and quality. 

            Toyota’s beginnings were humble. Shoichiro Toyoda ’s grandfather, Sakichi Toyoda, invented the automatic loom in a backyard shed, mainly because he wanted to help his mother, who often was weaving in their home. 

            People were skeptical when Kiichiro Toyoda said he wanted to start building cars in 1933. Back then, Japan only had imported cars like GMs and Fords.

            Today, “The Toyota Way,” a production method that empowers each worker for quality control, is viewed as the best in the auto industry. Toyota, which makes the Prius hybrid, Camry sedan and Lexus luxury models, is among the world’s top automakers in vehicle sales. 

            A funeral for Shoichiro Toyoda was being held for close family. A “farewell” event in his honor was being planned for a later date, according to Toyota. Details of other surviving family members were not immediately available.

Klook, an online travel agency for tours and activities, said in an interview with the media that according to the platform’s data, the traffic of Hong Kong and Macau users searching for Taiwanese products on Klook has soared by more than 2.5 times since Monday.According to Klook, the data initially showed that the top two products that Hong Kong and Macau tourists paid attention to were ""hotel accommodation"" and ""self-drive car rental."" The third popular item was the Taiwan High Speed Rail tickets and other transportation tickets. Compared to tourists from other countries, tourists from Hong Kong and Macao prefer Taiwanese food, exhibitions, and hot spring experiences.Taiwanese travel e-commerce platform KKday shared that as Taiwan is geologically close to Hong Kong and Macau, and there is no language barrier, it has always been one of the most popular overseas destinations for Hong Kong and Macau tourists.Hong Kong and Macau tourists also ranked third among KKday overseas tourists visiting Taiwan before the pandemic, and their favorite products are suburban tours, transportation tickets, one-day tours with chartered cars, special experiences, and gourmet dining, the platform said, per CNA.",2023/02/14,1023,Travel & Cuisine

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810160,What mortgage company changes mean for your home loan,"It’s been a bumpy ride for mortgage companies lately. Some lenders have gone out of business, merged with other companies or narrowed their focus. And more changes are likely in 2023.

            What does all this mean for borrowers?

            Here are answers to common questions, whether you’re shopping for a mortgage or paying off a home loan.











            WHAT’S BEHIND THE SHAKEOUT?

            A key factor: higher mortgage rates. Demand for home loans plummeted last year as the Federal Reserve raised a key interest rate to control inflation and mortgage rates spiked in turn. The average for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage doubled from near-historic lows in early January 2022 to almost 6.4% at year’s end, according to Freddie Mac, an enterprise created by Congress in 1970 to support the U.S. housing finance system.

            Higher mortgage rates shrink buying power, so elevated rates shut out some prospective homebuyers, already squeezed by eye-popping home prices.

            And for homeowners who had locked in historically low rates in prior years, the spike removed money-saving incentives to refinance their mortgages. Unless your primary aim is to cash out some home equity, it doesn’t make sense to refinance to a higher rate.

            As a result, fewer people applied for mortgages. Mortgage applications to buy homes dropped almost 40% year over year in the last few months of 2022, and refinance applications were down almost 90%, according to a December Mortgage Bankers Association forecast report.

            Higher rates also increased risk for banks and mortgage companies that buy mortgage loans from lenders.

            WHAT IF MY LENDER GOES BUST?

            Here’s what would happen:

            — If the lender that issued your loan goes out of business or goes bankrupt after the mortgage has closed, you’ll be unaffected. The loan terms will stay the same. If the mortgage company that services your loan changes, you’ll be informed of where to send your monthly payments.

            — If your lender runs into trouble and can’t fund the loan when you’re a week or two away from closing, the company will likely work with you to find another lender, says Mark Indelicato, a bankruptcy attorney and partner with Thompson Coburn Hahn & Hessen in New York. “What I’ve seen so far in the industry is the players work together to make sure that the borrowers themselves are not hurt,” he adds.

            Some mortgage companies have filed for bankruptcy or gone out of business in the past year. First Guaranty Mortgage Corp. announced June 30 that it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, for example. And some smaller lenders have simply gone out of business recently. Reali, a real estate company with an online lending arm, said in August that it was shutting down, and LenderFi said in an email in the fall that it was leaving the mortgage business.

            Indelicato, whose firm is the lead counsel for unsecured creditors in the First Guaranty Mortgage Corp. case, does not expect to see a big wave of mortgage company bankruptcies. “It’s not so bad that you’re going to see the wholesale bankruptcies like you saw of mortgage originators in 2007 and 2008,” he says.

            WHAT IF MY LENDER MERGES WITH ANOTHER COMPANY?

            A merge will have little direct impact on you. Your loan terms will stay the same if your lender merges with or is acquired by another company.

            Meanwhile, don’t be surprised to hear more about mortgage company mergers. Stratmor Group, a mortgage advisory company based in Greenwood Village, Colorado, projected in an October report that almost 50 mergers and acquisitions would be announced or closed by the end of 2022, a 50% jump from 2018, the year with the next-highest number in the past 30 years. And the consolidation trend will likely continue this year.

            WHAT HAPPENS IF MY MORTGAGE SERVICER CHANGES?

            You’ll be notified of where to send your mortgage payments. Your mortgage servicer is the company that processes payments and manages the loan. If the servicing rights are transferred to a different company, generally the old and new servicers should notify you, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The notices will tell you when the old servicer will stop accepting payments, when the new servicer will start accepting payments and the new servicer’s contact information. Read the notices and send payments to the new servicer after the transfer.

            WILL OTHER MORTGAGE BUSINESS CHANGES AFFECT ME?

            You’ll still have options if you’re seeking a mortgage. Some lenders may change the types of loans they offer or focus on different segments of consumers. Wells Fargo, for instance, said in January that it would create a “smaller, less complex” home lending business focused on bank customers, as well as people in underserved minority communities.

            The advice for shopping to get a mortgage remains the same. Look for lenders that offer the types of mortgages you’re interested in and apply with multiple lenders to compare rates and fees.

            WILL MORTGAGE COMPANY LAYOFFS COMPROMISE CUSTOMER SERVICE?

            Not necessarily. Layoffs generally correspond to lower loan volume; there’s less work to go around, so fewer employees are needed.

            Regardless of what’s happening in the industry, customer service is a key feature to consider when shopping for lenders. Many lenders offer a streamlined online application process. But even with robust digital tools available, you should be able to reach a human to help you through the process.

            Check customer service ratings online and from companies such as J.D. Power, a global data and analytics company. And when shopping for lenders, compare how quickly and helpfully they respond the first time you contact them with questions.

            ARE THESE CHANGES A SIGN OF A HOUSING CRASH OR MORTGAGE CRISIS?

            No.

            “Consumers should not be concerned about a potential crash as the one we saw during the Great Recession for a number of reasons,” Selma Hepp, chief economist at property analytics company CoreLogic, said by email in reference to the 2007-09 financial crisis.

            Lending standards have been strict in recent years, and a lot of buyers made sizable down payments, Hepp noted. In addition, most homeowners now have a lot of home equity, thanks to rising home prices.

            “That means that even if they lose a job, they are not forced into a foreclosure but can instead sell their home at a profit,” she said.

            Hepp doesn’t expect a huge wave of homes coming on the market. Many people bought their properties or refinanced when rates were low, so they have an incentive to stay put.

            Given the limited supply of homes for sale, experts generally don’t expect average home prices to fall steeply as they did in 2008 and 2009.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810161,Pakistan in bailout bid sharply raises natural gas taxes,"ISLAMABAD (AP) — Cash-strapped Pakistan sharply increased taxes on natural gas Tuesday to comply with a long-stalled financial bailout, and both industrial and everyday consumers were expected to feel the pain. 

            The government's bid to revive a $6 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund led it to hike taxes on natural gas for domestic and industrial consumers from 16% to 112%, shocking many Pakistanis who already are struggling. A similar increase in the price of electricity is expected to be announced this week. 

            “The prices of cooking oil and all food items have doubled in the past less than one year, but there has not been any increase in our income,” said Zameen Gul, 32, a father of three who works for a construction company in Peshawar. “I don’t know how we are going to survive.”











            Pakistan is struggling with instability stemming from an economic crisis, last summer's devastating floods and a recent surge in violence. A critical $1.2 billion portion of the 2019 bailout has been stalled since December, with the IMF urging Pakistan to raise more cash. 

            The tax hike on natural gas Tuesday is likely to further increase the cost of production and an increase in already spiraling inflation, experts said.

            “Pakistan's economy is currently like a rudderless ship, which is heading for a crash,"" said Ashfaq Ahmad, a Pakistani economist who has advised the government in the past. 

            Ahmad has been a critic of seeking bailouts from the IMF, but he said in these circumstances Pakistan had no other option. 

            “The government will have to impose new taxes and poor people will pay a heavy price for the bad policies of past governments which mostly relied on the IMF loans,"" he told The Associated Press. 

            Miftah Ismail, a former Pakistani finance minister, said the next six-to-eight months will be difficult for Pakistan but the country could, at some point, back away from the brink of default. 

            Pakistan agreed in 2019 to impose new taxes of 170 billion rupees in exchange for a bailout. Finance Minister Ishaq Dar this week told reporters that he expected the IMF to release the stalled $1.2 billion tranche from the deal. 

            Pakistan's foreign exchange reserves have fallen to below $3 billion, forcing the country to further tighten controls on imports of raw materials for the industrial sector. The crisis has caused some factories to close in recent weeks and others to lay off employees.

            Dar met with President Arif Alvi to brief him about his recent talks with the IMF. According to a statement from Alvi’s office Tuesday, the government wants to impose new taxes through an ordinance but he advised Dar that the government should convene parliament to discuss new taxes necessary to get IMF bailout.

            Amjad Ali, a 45-year-old rickshaw driver in Lahore, said he was unhappy with the performance of former premier Imran Khan because under his government prices skyrocketed. But things have not gotten easier or more affordable, he said.

            “The current government of Shahbaz Sharif is worse than Imran Khan's government,"" he said.

            Khan was ousted in a no-confidence vote in parliament in April, and he has blamed a U.S. plot against him — which Washington denies. Khan has also warned that Pakistan is on the brink of default.

            Sharif says the country's economy was badly hit by last summer's devastating floods that killed 1,739 people and caused billions of dollars in damage. Economists predict Pakistan’s inflation rate of 26% could jump to 40% because of the new taxes. But they fear the inflation rate will jump to more than 60% if Pakistan fails to get the IMF loan.

            Dar, the finance minister, hopes a revival of the loan will spur friendly countries to open their wallets. He insisted that the government will impose new taxes in such a way that the poor are not affected, but economists say the poor will be the hardest-hit victims.

            About 21% of Pakistan's 220 million people live in poverty, according to the Asian Development Bank. The majority are low- and middle-income, and less than 10% are wealthy elites.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810162,Coke sees slower growth ahead as price hikes moderate,"Coca-Cola said higher prices didn't hurt demand for its drinks in the fourth quarter, but it expects slower growth ahead as inflation cools and price increases moderate.

            The Atlanta company said Tuesday it expects organic revenue growth of 7% to 8% this year which would be half the 16% growth it delivered in 2022.

            Higher prices were a big contributor to Coke's revenue growth last year as it tried to compensate for rising costs of raw ingredients, labor and transportation. Pricing and mix — which includes changes in package sizes — contributed 12% to revenue growth in the fourth quarter, while concentrate sales rose 2%, Coke said. 











            Marketing costs also increased as Coke tried to grow sales in booming markets like India.

            In addition to shrinking can sizes or offering cheaper, returnable bottles in some markets, Coke has has been promoting more expensive products, like soft drinks in slimmer cans. It has high hopes for Jack and Coke, a ready-to-drink cocktail made with Jack Daniel’s whiskey, which will go on sale in the U.S. at the end of March.

            “We need to earn our pricing by delivering for consumers a value they appreciate,” Chairman and CEO James Quincey said Tuesday in a conference call.

            Quincey said Coke will continue to raise prices this year globally, but its price increases in developed markets will likely moderate along with inflation.

            Coke's revenue rose 7% to $10.1 billion in the October-December period, the company said Tuesday. That was slightly ahead of Wall Street forecasts, according to analysts polled by FactSet. 

            Demand for Coca-Cola Zero Sugar jumped 9% in the period, even as overall sales of sparkling soft drinks were flat. Coffee sales were up 11% as Coke expanded availability of its Costa brand. Sports drink sales grew 1%. Sales of juices, dairy and tea were down.

            Case volumes fell 1% globally in the fourth quarter. Coke said strong growth in various markets, including Brazil, Mexico and Great Britain, was overshadowed by the suspension of Coke's business in Russia. The company's pullout from Russia was finalized in August.

            North American case volumes were flat for the October-December period as growth in soft drinks, juices and Fairlife dairy were offset by declines in other categories. Quincey said the integration of Bodyarmor, the sports drink brand it acquired for $5.6 billion in late 2021, has been bumpier than the company would have liked.

            Case volumes fell 1% in Asia as strong growth in India and Vietnam was offset by pandemic restrictions in China. Case volumes fell 5% in Europe but rose 2% in Latin America.

            Coke's rival PepsiCo also benefited from price hikes in the fourth quarter, and last week reported better-than-expected sales. But Pepsi also warned that consumers may be less willing to accept price increases as this year progresses.

            Coke said its net income fell 16% to $2 billion for the October-December period, partly because the strong U.S. dollar impacted overseas profits. Adjusted for currency and other one-time factors, Coca-Cola earned 45 cents per share, line with analysts forecasts.

            Coke shares fell 1% in morning trading Tuesday.Coca-Cola said higher prices didn't hurt demand for its drinks in the fourth quarter, but it expects slower growth ahead as inflation cools and price increases moderate.The Atlanta company said Tuesday it expects organic revenue growth of 7% to 8% this year which would be half the 16% growth it delivered in 2022.Higher prices were a big contributor to Coke's revenue growth last year as it tried to compensate for rising costs of raw ingredients, labor and transportation.

It has high hopes for Jack and Coke, a ready-to-drink cocktail made with Jack Daniel’s whiskey, which will go on sale in the U.S. at the end of March.“We need to earn our pricing by delivering for consumers a value they appreciate,” Chairman and CEO James Quincey said Tuesday in a conference call.Quincey said Coke will continue to raise prices this year globally, but its price increases in developed markets will likely moderate along with inflation.Coke's revenue rose 7% to $10.1 billion in the October-December period, the company said Tuesday. That was slightly ahead of Wall Street forecasts, according to analysts polled by FactSet.Demand for Coca-Cola Zero Sugar jumped 9% in the period, even as overall sales of sparkling soft drinks were flat. Coffee sales were up 11% as Coke expanded availability of its Costa brand. Sports drink sales grew 1%. Sales of juices, dairy and tea were down.Case volumes fell 1% globally in the fourth quarter. Coke said strong growth in various markets, including Brazil, Mexico and Great Britain, was overshadowed by the suspension of Coke's business in Russia. The company's pullout from Russia was finalized in August.North American case volumes were flat for the October-December period as growth in soft drinks, juices and Fairlife dairy were offset by declines in other categories. Quincey said the integration of Bodyarmor, the sports drink brand it acquired for $5.6 billion in late 2021, has been bumpier than the company would have liked.Case volumes fell 1% in Asia as strong growth in India and Vietnam was offset by pandemic restrictions in China. Case volumes fell 5% in Europe but rose 2% in Latin America.Coke's rival PepsiCo also benefited from price hikes in the fourth quarter, and last week reported better-than-expected sales. But Pepsi also warned that consumers may be less willing to accept price increases as this year progresses.Coke said its net income fell 16% to $2 billion for the October-December period, partly because the strong U.S. dollar impacted overseas profits. Adjusted for currency and other one-time factors, Coca-Cola earned 45 cents per share, line with analysts forecasts.Coke shares fell 1% in morning trading Tuesday.",2023/02/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810163,"Amid ChatGPT outcry, some teachers are inviting AI to class","LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) — Under the fluorescent lights of a fifth grade classroom in Lexington, Kentucky, Donnie Piercey instructed his 23 students to try and outwit the “robot” that was churning out writing assignments. 

            The robot was the new artificial intelligence tool ChatGPT, which can generate everything from essays and haikus to term papers within seconds. The technology has panicked teachers and prompted school districts to block access to the site. But Piercey has taken another approach by embracing it as a teaching tool, saying his job is to prepare students for a world where knowledge of AI will be required.

            “This is the future,” said Piercey, who describes ChatGPT as just the latest technology in his 17 years of teaching that prompted concerns about the potential for cheating. The calculator, spellcheck, Google, Wikipedia, YouTube. Now all his students have Chromebooks on their desks. “As educators, we haven’t figured out the best way to use artificial intelligence yet. But it’s coming, whether we want it to or not.”











            One exercise in his class pitted students against the machine in a lively, interactive writing game. Piercey asked students to “Find the Bot:” Each student summarized a text about boxing champion and Kentucky icon Muhammad Ali, then tried to figure out which was written by the chatbot.

            At the elementary school level, Piercey is less worried about cheating and plagiarism than high school teachers. His district has blocked students from ChatGPT while allowing teacher access. Many educators around the country say districts need time to evaluate and figure out the chatbot but also acknowledge the futility of a ban that today’s tech-savvy students can work around.

            “To be perfectly honest, do I wish it could be uninvented? Yes. But it happened,” said Steve Darlow, the technology trainer at Florida's Santa Rosa County District Schools, which has blocked the application on school-issued devices and networks. 

            He sees the advent of AI platforms as both “revolutionary and disruptive” to education. He envisions teachers asking ChatGPT to make “amazing lesson plans for a substitute” or even for help grading papers. “I know it’s lofty talk, but this is a real game changer. You are going to have an advantage in life and business and education from using it.”

            ChatGPT quickly became a global phenomenon after its November launch, and rival companies including Google are racing to release their own versions of AI-powered chatbots. 

            The topic of AI platforms and how schools should respond drew hundreds of educators to conference rooms at the Future of Education Technology Conference in New Orleans last month, where Texas math teacher Heather Brantley gave an enthusiastic talk on the “Magic of Writing with AI for all Subjects.”

            Brantley said she was amazed at ChatGPT’s ability to make her sixth grade math lessons more creative and applicable to everyday life. 

            “I’m using ChatGPT to enhance all my lessons,” she said in an interview. The platform is blocked for students but open to teachers at her school, White Oak Intermediate. “Take any lesson you’re doing and say, ‘Give me a real-world example,’ and you’ll get examples from today — not 20 years ago when the textbooks we’re using were written.” 

            For a lesson about slope, the chatbot suggested students build ramps out of cardboard and other items found in a classroom, then measure the slope. For teaching about surface area, the chatbot noted that sixth graders would see how the concept applies to real life when wrapping gifts or building a cardboard box, said Brantley.

            She is urging districts to train staff to use the AI platform to stimulate student creativity and problem solving skills. “We have an opportunity to guide our students with the next big thing that will be part of their entire lives. Let’s not block it and shut them out.”

            Students in Piercey’s class said the novelty of working with a chatbot makes learning fun.

            After a few rounds of “Find the Bot,” Piercey asked his class what skills it helped them hone. Hands shot up. “How to properly summarize and correctly capitalize words and use commas,” said one student. A lively discussion ensued on the importance of developing a writing voice and how some of the chatbot’s sentences lacked flair or sounded stilted. 

            Trevor James Medley, 11, felt that sentences written by students “have a little more feeling. More backbone. More flavor.”

            Next, the class turned to playwriting, or as the worksheet handed out by Piercey called it: “Pl-ai Writing.” The students broke into groups and wrote down (using pencils and paper) the characters of a short play with three scenes to unfold in a plot that included a problem that needs to get solved.

            Piercey fed details from worksheets into the ChatGPT site, along with instructions to set the scenes inside a fifth grade classroom and to add a surprise ending. Line by line, it generated fully formed scripts, which the students edited, briefly rehearsed and then performed. 

            One was about a class computer that escapes, with students going on a hunt to find it. The play’s creators giggled over unexpected plot twists that the chatbot introduced, including sending the students on a time travel adventure.

            “First of all, I was impressed,” said Olivia Laksi, 10, one of the protagonists. She liked how the chatbot came up with creative ideas. But she also liked how Piercey urged them to revise any phrases or stage directions they didn’t like. “It’s helpful in the sense that it gives you a starting point. It’s a good idea generator.”

            She and classmate Katherine McCormick, 10, said they can see the pros and cons of working with chatbots. They can help students navigate writer’s block and help those who have trouble articulating their thoughts on paper. And there is no limit to the creativity it can add to classwork.

            The fifth graders seemed unaware of the hype or controversy surrounding ChatGPT. For these children, who will grow up as the world’s first native AI users, their approach is simple: Use it for suggestions, but do your own work.

            “You shouldn’t take advantage of it,” McCormick says. “You’re not learning anything if you type in what you want, and then it gives you the answer.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810164,Gunmen storm hospital of newborn saved from quake in Syria,"BEIRUT (AP) — Gunmen stormed a Syrian hospital that is caring for a baby girl who was born under the rubble of her family’s earthquake-shattered home, and the attackers beat the facility's director, a hospital official said Tuesday.

            The official denied reports on social media that the Monday night attack was an attempt to kidnap the infant named Aya — Arabic for “a sign from God.” She has been at the hospital since hours after the Feb. 6. earthquake that hit Turkey and Syria. Her parents and four siblings died in the disaster.

            Aya's story has been widely shared in news reports, and people from around the world have offered to help her.











            The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals, said the hospital’s director had suspected that a nurse who was taking pictures of Aya was planning to kidnap her and kicked him out of the hospital. The nurse returned hours later accompanied by gunmen who beat up the director, the official said.

            
                The director's wife has been breast-feeding Aya, her doctor said previously.

            Upon arrival at the hospital, the gunmen told police officers protecting the girl that they were going after the director for firing their friend and were not interested in Aya, according to the official.

            Police began guarding the girl after several people showed up falsely claiming to be her relatives, the doctor said.

            Aya may be able to leave the hospital as soon as Tuesday or Wednesday, according to her great-uncle, Saleh al-Badran. He said the baby’s paternal aunt, who recently gave birth and survived the quake, will raise her.

            Rescue workers in the northern Syrian town of Jinderis discovered the dark-haired baby girl more than 10 hours after the quake as they were digging through the wreckage of the five-story apartment building where her parents lived.

            Buried under the concrete, the baby was still connected by her umbilical cord to her mother, Afraa Abu Hadiya. She was rushed to the hospital in nearby Afrin, where she has been cared for since.

            The devastating quake reduced many communities in southeastern Turkey and northern Syria to piles of broken concrete and twisted metal. More than 35,000 people were killed, a toll expected to rise as search teams find more bodies.

            The earthquake destroyed dozens of housing units in the town of Jinderis, where Aya’s family had been living since 2018.

            Aya’s father, Abdullah Turki Mleihan, was originally from the village of Khsham in eastern Deir el-Zour province, but left in 2014 after the Islamic State group captured the village, said al-Badran, an uncle of Aya’s father.BEIRUT (AP) — Gunmen stormed a Syrian hospital that is caring for a baby girl who was born under the rubble of her family’s earthquake-shattered home, and the attackers beat the facility's director, a hospital official said Tuesday.The official denied reports on social media that the Monday night attack was an attempt to kidnap the infant named Aya — Arabic for “a sign from God.” She has been at the hospital since hours after the Feb. 6. earthquake that hit Turkey and Syria.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810166,Dutch appeals court prohibits border police ethnic profiling,"THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — An appeals court on Tuesday prohibited the Netherlands' military police from using racial profiling as a way of selecting people for identity checks at borders, marking a victory for two citizens and rights groups who sued the government.

            The Hague Court of Appeal overturned a 2021 ruling that said ethnicity could be one of the criteria for singling out passengers, but not the only one. The checks are carried out at airports and on trains and buses from European Union destinations to prevent people illegally coming and staying in the Netherlands.

            The appeal court said in a statement that it found that the police, called the Marechaussee, “makes a distinction on the basis of race. Given the serious consequences of discrimination on grounds of race, such discrimination should only be made if there are particularly compelling reasons. The State has not demonstrated such compelling reasons.""











            The court said it “therefore prohibits the State from making selection decisions that are (partly) based on race” during border checks.

            The case was brought by two citizens who argued that they were singled out for checks by officers from the country’s Marechaussee police force because of the color of their skin.

            One of the plaintiffs, Mpanzu Bamenga, a city councillor from Eindhoven who was born in Congo, said after the original ruling in 2021, every time he returned to ""my country, the Netherlands, I’m being stopped because of my ethnicity.”

            On Tuesday, he was jubilant at the court's ruling.

            “This is discrimination, it’s ethnic profiling,"" he said in a telephone interview. And it’s so wonderful to see that the higher courts basically acknowledge it. And for me, as a human being, it’s so good to see that justice has prevailed.”

            The Marechaussee said after the 2021 court case that it would change the way it works at border checks, but the appeals court said it saw “no or only limited change in working method.”

            Marechaussee spokesman Maj. Robert van Kapel said the organization would carefully study the ruling “and see what its consequences are for now.” 

            The organization has the option to appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court.

            Dionne Abdoelhafiezkhan of the Dutch rights group Controle Alt Delete said the court ruling “also makes it clear that someone’s appearance and color say nothing about someone’s nationality. That’s an important correction to the court’s earlier ruling that shocked many people of color and made us feel like second-class citizens.”THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — An appeals court on Tuesday prohibited the Netherlands' military police from using racial profiling as a way of selecting people for identity checks at borders, marking a victory for two citizens and rights groups who sued the government.The Hague Court of Appeal overturned a 2021 ruling that said ethnicity could be one of the criteria for singling out passengers, but not the only one.

(AP) — Nikki Haley, former South Carolina governor and Trump’s UN ambassador, launches 2024 Republican presidential campaign.CHARLESTON, S.C.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810168,"Nikki Haley announces run for president, challenging Trump","CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) — Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor and United Nations ambassador, announced her candidacy for president on Tuesday, becoming the first major challenger to former President Donald Trump for the 2024 Republican nomination.

            The announcement, delivered in a tweeted video, marks an about-face for the ex-Trump Cabinet official, who said two years ago that she wouldn’t challenge her former boss for the White House in 2024. But she changed her mind in recent months, citing, among other things, the country’s economic troubles and the need for “generational change,” a nod to the 76-year-old Trump’s age.

            “You should know this about me. I don't put up with bullies. And when you kick back, it hurts them more if you're wearing heels,” Haley said. “I'm Nikki Haley, and I'm running for president.”











            Haley, 51, is the first in a long line of Republicans who are expected to launch 2024 campaigns in the coming months. Among them are Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, former Vice President Mike Pence, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina.

            President Joe Biden has said he intends to seek reelection in 2024, stalling any jostling for the Democratic nomination.

            Haley has regularly boasted about her track record of defying political expectations, saying, “I’ve never lost an election, and I’m not going to start now.”

            If elected, Haley would be the nation’s first female president and the first U.S. president of Indian descent.

            The daughter of Indian immigrants, Haley grew up enduring racist taunts in a small South Carolina town and has long referenced that impact on her personal and political arc.

            In the three-and-a-half minute video, Haley referenced that past, saying she grew up “not Black, not white — I was different."" 

            Despite that, Haley insisted that America is not a racist country: “Nothing could be further from the truth.” Playing in the background of her video were images of media reports related to The New York Times Magazine’s Pulitzer Prize-winning “1619 Project” — which centered the country’s history around slavery.

            Haley never mentions Trump by name in the video, instead saying “the Washington establishment has failed us over and over and over again."" Haley leans into a call for “a new generation of leadership,” which has become the refrain of her messaging leading up to the launch.

            There appears to be openness among Republicans to new leadership, according to a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. In an open-ended question asking Republicans to choose who they want to lead their party, a majority of Republicans didn't choose either Trump or DeSantis, considered the former president's top rival. But they also didn't have a clear alternative in mind.

            Eleven other politicians, including Haley, are named by just 1% of Republicans as their preferred leader.

            In a statement, Taylor Budowich, spokesman for Trump's super PAC, said Haley was “just another career politician.”

            “She started out as a Never Trumper before resigning to serve in the Trump admin,” he said. ""She then resigned early to go rake in money on corporate boards. Now, she’s telling us she represents a ‘new generation.’ Sure just looks like more of the same, a career politician whose only fulfilled commitment is to herself.”

            Before entering politics, Haley was an accountant. She defeated the longest-serving member of the South Carolina House in 2004 in her first bid for public office. Three terms later and with little statewide recognition, Haley mounted a long-shot campaign for governor against a large field of experienced politicians.

            She racked up a number of high-profile endorsements, including from the sitting South Carolina governor, Mark Sanford, and former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, a tea party darling.

            With her 2010 victory, Haley became South Carolina’s first female and minority governor — and the nation’s youngest at 38. She earned a speaking slot at the 2012 Republican National Convention and gave the GOP response to President Barack Obama’s State of the Union in 2016.

            The defining moment of Haley’s time as governor came after the 2015 murders of nine Black parishioners in a Charleston church by a self-avowed white supremacist who had been pictured holding Confederate flags.

            For years, Haley had resisted calls to remove the Confederate flag from the Statehouse grounds, even casting a rival’s push for its removal as a desperate stunt. But after the massacre and with the support of other leading Republicans, Haley advocated for legislation to remove the flag. It came down less than a month after the murders.

            In the 2016 presidential primary, Haley was an early supporter of Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, later shifting to Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. She ultimately said she would back the party’s nominee.

            Shortly after Trump’s victory, he tapped Haley to be his U.N. ambassador, a move that rewarded Henry McMaster, the lieutenant governor who was the nation’s first statewide elected official to back Trump’s 2016 campaign. Haley’s departure cleared the way for McMaster to ascend to the governorship he had sought, since losing a bruising primary to none other than Haley seven years earlier.

            With her Senate confirmation, Haley became the first Indian American in a presidential Cabinet.

            During her nearly two-year tenure, Haley feuded at times with other administration officials while bolstering her own public persona.

            One of her most memorable moments as U.N. ambassador came in 2018 after National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow suggested Haley had suffered “momentary confusion” when she said Russian sanctions were imminent.

            “With all due respect, I don’t get confused,” she responded. The first half of the quote became the title of her 2019 memoir.

            Her departure from the job later that year fueled speculation that she would challenge Trump in 2020 or replace Pence on the ticket. She did neither.

            Instead, Haley returned to South Carolina, where she bought a home on the wealthy enclave Kiawah Island, joined the board of aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co., launched herself on the speaking circuit and wrote two books, including the memoir.

            After the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection, Haley initially cast doubts on Trump’s political future but said she wouldn’t challenge him in 2024. She later shifted course, citing inflation, crime, drugs and a “foreign policy in disarray” among her reasons for considering a White House campaign.

            During his South Carolina stop last month, Trump told WIS-TV that Haley had called to seek his opinion on running for president. Trump pointed out her earlier pledge not to run against him but said he made no attempt to stop her.

            “She said she would never run against me because I was the greatest president, but people change their opinions, and they change what’s in their hearts,” Trump said. “So I said, ‘If your heart wants to do it, you have to go do it.’”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810169,Stanford University and VinBrain - To design a state-of-the-art AI-enabled platform to advance medical diagnosis and treatments,"Stanford University and VinBrain signed a Data Use Agreement to improve the precision of Radiology interpretation using a multi-modal “RadGraph” Method

HANOI, VIETNAM -  Media OutReach - 14 February 2023 - On Jan 12 (PST Time), Mr. Steven Truong, CEO of  VinBrain, attended the Data Use Agreement Signing Ceremony at the Stanford campus (Palo Alto, USA) organized by Stanford Center for Artificial Intelligence for Medical and Imaging (AIMI). This ceremony occurred with AIMI's Director, Professor Curtis Langlotz along with other distinguished AIMI leaders, and the VinBrain leadership team.        Signing Ceremony of Data Use Agreement with Stanford University (photo: VinBrain)      To design a state-of-the-art AI-enabled platform for more accurate diagnosis and treatments, a tremendous amount of geographically distributed data, medical images, and patient medical records are required for system training.        Stanford University will share data with VinBrain for model training and testing models to boost efficiency in Radiology reports      The DUA grants Stanford University and VinBrain the collaborative power to improve efficiency in radiology reports and advance AI in healthcare by sharing relevant de-identified data for model training and testing, while tackling complexity, ambiguity, and limitations in medical image interpretation.   Starting with 240,000 anonymized medical images and report pairs provided by Stanford through this DUA, VinBrain will work to improve the accuracy of the RadGraph method through a research collaboration with Stanford to extract clinical entities and relation annotations from a large dataset of full-text radiology reports.   With this strong support from Stanford, VinBrain aims to raise the bar for research on AI solutions by collaborating beyond Vietnam to improve product quality, meanwhile, continuing to add and develop the most massive data source in Vietnam to date, with more than 2.3 million images being analyzed through the DrAid™ platform so far.   Mr. Steven Truong affirmed: ""VinBrain always strictly adheres to data security regulations according to USA standards."" He also emphasized that Stanford sharing data with VinBrain demonstrates Stanford's absolute trust in VinBrain's commitment to data privacy and security.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810178,Taiwan threatens to shoot down any Chinese balloons,"BEIJING (AP) — Amid speculation over alleged Chinese spy balloons, Taiwan’s Defense Ministry said Tuesday it would shoot down any suspected military object coming close to its shores from mainland China. 

            Maj. Gen. Huang Wen-chi, the assistant deputy chief of general staff for intelligence, told reporters that the self-governing island was on guard for any incursions, but had yet to find any that had penetrated its defenses.

            Balloons found so far around Taiwan were used for meteorological exploration, he said. They were relatively small and light and would burst after rising to an altitude that could be threatening. Taiwan has yet to find targets requiring a lethal response, he said. 











            ""We haven’t seen such sophisticated spy balloons sent by the Chinese Communist Party in the waters near Taiwan,” Huang said, referring to the balloon shot down by the U.S. earlier this month after traveling for days from above Alaska to South Carolina. 

            China, which claims Taiwan as its territory to be reunited by force if necessary, regularly sends fighter jets and other military assets into Taiwan's airspace and sea lanes.

            Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin called the U.S. downing of the Chinese balloon a “clear overreaction."" Beijing says it was an unmanned airship made for meteorological research that had been blown off course. 

            The U.S. military had engaged an “absurd and costly large-scale political performance art show. We also advise the U.S. side to be careful about overexerting itself and spraining its back,"" Wang said at a daily news briefing. 

            The White House defended the shootdowns of three unidentified objects in as many days even as it acknowledged that officials had no indication the objects were intended for surveillance in the same manner as the high-altitude Chinese balloon.BEIJING (AP) — Amid speculation over alleged Chinese spy balloons, Taiwan’s Defense Ministry said Tuesday it would shoot down any suspected military object coming close to its shores from mainland China.Maj.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810179,Israeli Cabinet ministers reject US criticism on settlements,"JERUSALEM (AP) — Two ultranationalist Israeli Cabinet ministers on Tuesday defiantly dismissed a growing chorus of global condemnation of new Israeli settlement construction in the West Bank, instead promising to double down and legalize dozens of wildcat outposts in the occupied territory.

            Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir reaffirmed their commitment to expand Israeli authority in the lands that the Palestinians seek for a future state. Their comments came after the United States expressed opposition to the move and as four European countries added their criticism.

            Smotrich, a religious settler, said he and his allies in the government — the most right-wing in Israel's history — remain “committed to removing completely the restrictions on building in Judea and Samaria,” referring to the West Bank by its biblical names. 











            “Disagreements are allowed, even between friends,” he added.

            Ben-Gvir, who also lives in a Jewish settlement in the occupied West Bank, urged the U.S. and Europe to “stop being worried.” 

            “The Land of Israel belongs to the people of Israel,"" he said emphatically. ""Nine settlements is nice. But it’s still not enough. We want many more.”

            On Tuesday, some of Europe's top diplomats joined the U.S. in censuring Israel over its plans to build 10,000 new homes in existing settlements in the West Bank and retroactively legalize nine outposts. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Cabinet announced the measure on Sunday, following a surge in violence in Jerusalem.

            We “are deeply troubled by the Israeli government's announcement,” read the joint statement from the foreign ministers of France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and the U.S. “We strongly oppose these unilateral actions which will only serve to exacerbate tensions between Israelis and Palestinians.” 

            Israel's Arab neighbors Jordan and Egypt, as well as Saudi Arabia and Norway, similarly expressed grave concern and strong opposition to the new settlement plans.

            Still, there was no mention of potential consequences. Despite years of accumulated frustration and escalating rhetoric over Israel's fast-expanding settlements that threaten the realization of the two-state solution that has been a goal of the peace process for years, the U.S. and European Union have avoided taking serious action.

            Israel's new government could nonetheless test the country's closest ties. In a contentious coalition deal, Netanyahu promised Smotrich authority over the defense body responsible for planning for both settlements and Palestinian construction in parts of the West Bank where Israel maintains civilian control.

            Once he receives those powers, Smotrich has vowed to “normalize” life for more than 500,000 Israeli settlers in the West Bank, erasing the differences between living in a settlement and within Israel’s internationally recognized border and effectively annexing West Bank territory. Such a move would draw widespread backlash.

            Israel captured the West Bank, along with east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, in the 1967 Mideast war. Most of the international community considers Israeli settlements illegal and and an obstacle to peace. Some 700,000 Israeli settlers live in the West Bank and Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem.

            Ultranationalists who oppose Palestinian statehood comprise a majority of Israel’s new government, which has declared settlement construction a top priority.JERUSALEM (AP) — Two ultranationalist Israeli Cabinet ministers on Tuesday defiantly dismissed a growing chorus of global condemnation of new Israeli settlement construction in the West Bank, instead promising to double down and legalize dozens of wildcat outposts in the occupied territory.Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir reaffirmed their commitment to expand Israeli authority in the lands that the Palestinians seek for a future state.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810193,"Air India reveals orders for 470 Boeing, Airbus jets","LONDON (AP) — Air India unveiled orders Tuesday for 470 Boeing and Airbus passenger jets as it races to tap surging demand for increasingly affordable air travel from the nation's growing ranks of middle-class consumers.

            India’s largest international airline and second-largest domestic carrier is buying 220 Boeing aircraft valued at $34 billion. It marks the U.S. plane maker's third-largest sale of all time, in dollar value, and its second of all time in quantity.

            Air India is also buying 250 passenger jets from European plane manufacturer Airbus, with the orders championed by the leaders of the U.S., France and India.











            The Boeing “purchase will support over 1 million American jobs across 44 states, and many will not require a four-year college degree,"" U.S. President Joe Biden said. “This announcement also reflects the strength of the U.S.-India economic partnership.”

            Air India is seeking to reinvent itself by expanding its operations and modernizing its fleet. The new jets will help the airline's owner, Tata Sons, compete against upstart discount rivals including India’s dominant carrier, IndiGo.

            “India is going to be the world’s third-largest market in the aviation sector,” Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a videoconference. Over the next 15 years, it’s estimated that India will need more than 2,000 aircraft, and “today’s historic announcement will help in meeting this growing demand.” 

            The Boeing order includes 190 737 Max aircraft, 20 of its 787s, and 10 of its 777Xs. The purchase includes customer options for an additional 50 737 MAXs and 20 of its 787s, which would make it 290 airplanes for a total of $45.9 billion at list price.

            Toulouse, France-based Airbus will provide Air India 40 wide-body A350 Airbus aircraft and another 210 narrow-body A320neo planes, Tata Sons Chairman Natarajan Chandrasekaran said in the call with Modi and French President Emmanuel Macron. 

            Airbus did not disclose financial terms of the deal, which could be worth tens of billions of dollars. 

            “Today is a historic moment for India, for Air India and for Airbus,” Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury said in the call. The size of the order “demonstrates the appetite for growth in the Indian aviation industry. It's the fastest growing in the world.""

            Chandrasekaran said the A350s will be used to ""fly all ultra long distance across the globe."" Single-aisle A320s are typically used on short-haul routes. He said the airline has “significant options” to increase its order. 

            “The order’s massive, but a lot of it is long overdue replacement. Air India is way behind in modernizing their fleet,” said Brendan Sobie, a Singapore-based independent aviation analyst. 

            Demand for air travel in India and elsewhere in Asia has boomed over the past decade, fueled by fast-growing economies that have raised incomes and made travel more affordable for many millions of people. 

            For Air India, “there’s a lot of catch up to do,” Sobie said. It’s competing with newer budget airlines that moved faster to tap demand on domestic services as well as foreign carriers that are formidable competitors on international routes, he added. 

            Tata Sons, India’s oldest and largest conglomerate, regained ownership of the debt-laden national carrier last year. The Tata Group pioneered commercial aviation in India when it launched the airline in 1932. It was taken over by the government in 1953.

            Modi and Macron applauded the Airbus deal, with both saying it's a sign of the strengthening “strategic partnership"" between their countries. 

            Macron called the deal a “new success” and an opportunity to “develop new areas of cooperation with India.""

            Tata is integrating Air India with Vistara, which it jointly runs with Singapore Airlines, and with Air Asia India, which it runs with Malaysian discount operator Air Asia.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810194,Thai PM candidate visits lucky locales to boost his chances,"BANGKOK (AP) — The campaign for this year’s general election in Thailand has not yet officially begun, but aspirants for the prime minister’s job are already angling for auspicious photo ops.

            If symbolism won elections, one of the main contenders, Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwan, would be a shoo-in.

            Prawit hit the campaign trail on Tuesday at a series of locations in Bangkok chosen to enlist fate on his side.











            The former general is nicknamed “Big Pom.” On a hot afternoon he visited temples in the capital’s Pom Prap Sattru Phai district, which translates as “Pom destroys all enemies,” and prayed for success.

            He ended his tour at a well-known old fort whose name can be loosely translated as “Pom of great power.”

            Superstition and the search for lucky signs play a significant part in Thai politics.

            The general election -– the first since 2019 -– is expected to be called within weeks, with voting most likely in May.

            Prawit has already declared his candidacy for the top post under the banner of Palang Pracharath, the current main governing party. Incumbent Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha has joined a new group, the United Thai Nation Party. Also expected to run, and pose a formidable challenge, is Paetongtarn Shinawatra, daughter of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted by an army coup in 2006.

            In a brief talk with reporters, Prawit noted that he had chosen to launch his push with Bangkok voters on Valentine’s Day.

            “Today is Valentine’s Day so I want love from Bangkokians. We can then love one another, move on beyond conflicts so that we can work on getting rid of poverty and drought in our country,” he said.

            A December national poll by the National Institute of Development and Administration suggests the love may be unrequited. Despite his reputation for being a wily operator, his party languished at seventh place in popularity, while Big Pom didn’t make the top 10 choices for prime minister.BANGKOK (AP) — The campaign for this year’s general election in Thailand has not yet officially begun, but aspirants for the prime minister’s job are already angling for auspicious photo ops.If symbolism won elections, one of the main contenders, Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwan, would be a shoo-in.Prawit hit the campaign trail on Tuesday at a series of locations in Bangkok chosen to enlist fate on his side.The former general is nicknamed “Big Pom.” On a hot afternoon he visited temples in the capital’s Pom Prap Sattru Phai district, which translates as “Pom destroys all enemies,” and prayed for success.He ended his tour at a well-known old fort whose name can be loosely translated as “Pom of great power.”Superstition and the search for lucky signs play a significant part in Thai politics.The general election -– the first since 2019 -– is expected to be called within weeks, with voting most likely in May.Prawit has already declared his candidacy for the top post under the banner of Palang Pracharath, the current main governing party.

We can then love one another, move on beyond conflicts so that we can work on getting rid of poverty and drought in our country,” he said.A December national poll by the National Institute of Development and Administration suggests the love may be unrequited. Despite his reputation for being a wily operator, his party languished at seventh place in popularity, while Big Pom didn’t make the top 10 choices for prime minister.",2023/02/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810195,China's Xi expresses support for Iran amid Western pressure,"BEIJING (AP) — Chinese leader Xi Jinping expressed support for Iran during a visit Tuesday by its president as Tehran tries to expand relations with Beijing and Moscow to offset Western sanctions over its nuclear development.

            The official Chinese account of Xi’s meeting with Ebrahim Raisi gave no indication whether they discussed Russia’s attack on Ukraine. Tehran supplied military drones to Russian President Vladimir Putin's government but says they were delivered before the war began.

            Xi expressed support for Raisi’s government in language Beijing uses to criticize Washington’s domination of global affairs. China and Iran portray themselves, alongside Moscow, as counterweights to American power.











            “China supports Iran in safeguarding national sovereignty” and “resisting unilateralism and bullying,” Xi said in a statement carried by Chinese state TV on its website.

            Xi and Raisi attended the signing of 20 cooperation agreements including trade and tourism, the Chinese government announced. Those add to a 25-year strategy agreement signed in 2021 to cooperate in developing oil, industry and other fields.

            China is one of the biggest buyers of Iranian oil and a source of investment.

            Iran has struggled for years under trade and financial sanctions imposed by Washington and other Western governments over what they say is Tehran’s efforts to develop nuclear weapons, an accusation the Iranian government denies. The United States government cut off Iran’s access to the network that connects global banks in 2018.

            U.S. State Department spokesperson Ned Price urged China to influence Iran and lower potential threats in the region, saying that “would be in both of our interests.”

            “The PRC has a role to play in very clearly signaling to Iran that its destabilizing activities — that its brinksmanship — is not going to be rewarded, it’s not going to be countenanced. It is not something that the international community is prepared to sit idly by and watch,” Price said Tuesday to reporters in Washington, referring to China by its official name, the People’s Republic of China.

            Xi said Beijing “opposes external forces interfering in Iran’s internal affairs and undermining Iran’s security and stability,” according to the government statement. It said Xi promised to “work together on issues involving each other’s core interests,” but gave no details.

            Raisi’s government didn’t immediately release details of the meeting, but the president called the two governments “friends in difficult situations” in a commentary published Monday by the ruling Communist Party newspaper People’s Daily.

            A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, asked whether Beijing was concerned that getting closer to Iran might complicate U.S.-Chinese ties, said their “friend relations” contribute to “promotion of peace and stability in the Middle East.”

            “Our relations do not target any third parties,” said the spokesperson, Wang Wenbin.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810214,Valencia hires former player Rubén Baraja to replace Gattuso,"MADRID (AP) — Struggling Spanish soccer club Valencia hired former player Rubén Baraja as coach on Tuesday to replace Gennaro Gattuso and help the team avoid relegation.

            Baraja, who previously coached several second-division clubs in Spain, arrives with Valencia sitting in 18th place after 21 matches, inside the relegation zone.

            Gattuso left last month after a series of poor results. Interim coach Voro González had been in charge until now, losing all three matches in which he was in command. Gattuso arrived in June on a two-year contract. The Italian coach left with the team in 14th place.











            The 47-year-old Baraja, a former Valencia and Spain midfielder, previously coached teams such as Real Zaragoza, Tenerife, Sporting Gijón, Rayo Vallecano and Elche. He also had a stint in charge of a Valencia youth squad. Baraja had not been coaching since leaving Real Zaragoza in 2020.

            As a player, Baraja helped Valencia win Spanish league titles in 2002 and 2004, in addition to a UEFA Cup, a European Super Cup and a Copa del Rey.

            Valencia said in a statement that Baraja “knows the idiosyncrasies of the club and returns home to contribute with his professionalism and commitment as a coach after forging his legendary figure in the 2000s.”

            Another former Valencia player, Carlos Marchena, will be part of Baraja’s coaching staff. He was a former teammate of Baraja at the club.

            Valencia has lost five straight games in all competitions, including four in a row in the league. It has only one league win in its last 13 matches in the competition — against Real Betis in November, before the World Cup. The team lost at home to Athletic Bilbao 2-1 on Saturday, when fans against protested against club owners.

            Several hundred Valencia fans rallied outside Mestalla Stadium against Singaporean businessman Peter Lim, who they blame for selling off Valencia’s best players year after year. Several held up fans saying “Lim Go Home.”

            Valencia's next league match is at 19th-place Getafe on Monday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810215,Tory Burch deconstructs classic style in new NYFW collection,"NEW YORK (AP) — Some think they know the Tory Burch aesthetic because of the ubiquitous iconic gold metal branding on shoes and handbags, but more recently Burch has been focusing on the unexpected.

            Her fall/winter 2023 presentation at New York Fashion Week on Monday night featured deconstructed looks in rich colors and fabrics that served as a creative surprise.

            Burch loves a dramatic backdrop and says the space at the historic Emigrant Industrial Savings Bank (built in 1909 in the Beaux-Arts style) in downtown Manhattan set a scene, with mercurial shapes and artworks twisting into themselves, projected onto the towering ornate walls and a mysterious curtain that revealed the models as they entered.











            “I just thought it was such an interesting venue to experiment with distortion,” Burch told The Associated Press in an interview following the show. “The collection is a lot about distortion and femininity, and so just even taking in Venus and having her feel distorted, and the architecture … you’re looking at something, and that’s perception versus reality.”

            The show included Burch hallmarks — neutral, classic colors like navy, tan, black and olive, but with splashes of brightness in red or metallic shoes and purses. But many looks reflected the themes of deconstruction: asymmetrical lines in skirts and belts, long blazers, exaggerated blouse cuffs, and long and slouchy sleeves and pants.

            “It was meant to be a bit undone,” Burch explained. ""I wanted to crush that idea and challenge the concept of what is femininity and what is beauty, What is perfection? To me, it was a little bit about like how to do beautiful and construction and silhouette but also allow room for interpretation.”

            The mixes of colors and fabrics were also unexpected — like a long navy wool jacket hugging the model’s shape, topping bright lime green satin pants that overflowed over pointed shoes. The jumbo-sized safety pins accenting skirts and dresses and appearing in punk-ish earrings stood out. Another themed element was the mix of casual fabrics with more luxurious ones. One look had a denim knee-length skirt paired with a navy wool peacoat with a shearling collar.

            “The satin was this old lingerie idea, looks that were something that women traditionally hide, shapewear that I wanted to expose, and make that beautiful,"" Burch said. “I twisted them and we made them different proportions and they were off kilter.”

            Burch shows often attract star power on the runway and in the audience. Models Emily Ratajkowski and Irina Shayk helped close out the show, while front row guests included actors Claire Foy, Suki Waterhouse and Lana Condor.

            Model Ashley Graham said she’s a huge fan of Burch, especially for making clothing that is accessible at almost any size. Graham said she had to contain herself when she saw her model friends strutting the runway.

            “When I’m watching the girls walk in the show, I’m like, ‘It’s OK, you’ve got this. Yes! You’re not going to fall. You’re owning it. You’re a supermodel!’ And it takes everything in me not to scream some of their names,” Graham said with a laugh.NEW YORK (AP) — Some think they know the Tory Burch aesthetic because of the ubiquitous iconic gold metal branding on shoes and handbags, but more recently Burch has been focusing on the unexpected.Her fall/winter 2023 presentation at New York Fashion Week on Monday night featured deconstructed looks in rich colors and fabrics that served as a creative surprise.Burch loves a dramatic backdrop and says the space at the historic Emigrant Industrial Savings Bank (built in 1909 in the Beaux-Arts style) in downtown Manhattan set a scene, with mercurial shapes and artworks twisting into themselves, projected onto the towering ornate walls and a mysterious curtain that revealed the models as they entered.“I just thought it was such an interesting venue to experiment with distortion,” Burch told The Associated Press in an interview following the show. “The collection is a lot about distortion and femininity, and so just even taking in Venus and having her feel distorted, and the architecture … you’re looking at something, and that’s perception versus reality.”The show included Burch hallmarks — neutral, classic colors like navy, tan, black and olive, but with splashes of brightness in red or metallic shoes and purses.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810217,"Guardiola unsure on Haaland's fitness, says sorry to Gerrard","LONDON (AP) — Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola was unsure Tuesday whether Erling Haaland will be available for the huge Premier League game against Arsenal.

            The striker was substituted at halftime in City’s 3-1 win over Aston Villa on Sunday with what Guardiola at the time described as a “knock.”

            Haaland took part in a recovery session on Monday but Guardiola could not say if the league's top scorer, with 25 goals, would be healthy enough to play at Emirates Stadium on Wednesday in a match between the top two.











            “Right now, I don't know,” Guardiola said.

            The teams are separated by three points and City could go into first place on goal difference with a win, although Arsenal has a game in hand.

            While saying it was an “important” game, Guardiola attempted to play down its significance with City, the defending champion, still having 15 more games to play.

            “I have the feeling many things are still to happen,” Guardiola said. ""The FA Cup and Champions League is a knockout and we'll try to arrive for the last 8-10 games in the Premier League being there. This is the target.

            “I would say tomorrow would help us to be there in those 8-10 games.”

            City beat Arsenal 1-0 in the FA Cup last month, though that match was at Etihad Stadium and the visitors fielded a slightly weakened lineup.

            Guardiola believes this is the strongest Arsenal team he has faced since joining City in 2016.

            “So far it’s the best team in the Premier League — they've made an incredible first (half) of the league,” he said.

            “We felt it a few weeks ago when we played the FA Cup here how committed and sharp (Arsenal was). ... It will be a big battle in all departments.""

            Before taking any questions at his pre-match news conference, Guardiola issued an apology to Steven Gerrard for what the City manager described as his “unnecessary and stupid"" comments about the Liverpool great last week.

            While launching a defiant defense of City following accusations by the Premier League that the club breached a slew of financial regulations from 2009-18, Guardiola brought up Gerrard's infamous slip during Liverpool's 2-0 loss to Chelsea in one of the final games of the 2013-14 season.

            That loss for Liverpool helped City win the league that season.

            “I don’t know if we are responsible for Steven Gerrard slipping,” Guardiola said on Friday. “You know that situation at Anfield? I didn’t want it out of respect for Steven Gerrard, but it’s our fault?”

            On Tuesday, Guardiola said he admired Gerrard and was “ashamed” of himself.

            “He doesn't deserve it,” he said. “I didn't represent my club well, putting his name in these stupid comments.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810218,Charles Leclerc feeling good in Ferrari's new SF-23 car,"Several hundred fans, a coin toss and an iconic red car already on the track — it wasn’t the usual Formula One car presentation for Ferrari on Tuesday.

            In front of a grandstand packed with about 500 passionate red-clad fans, drivers Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz Jr. did laps of Ferrari’s Fiorano track in the new SF-23 car.

            “It is extremely special. Every time we come to Italy there’s so much passion,” Leclerc said. “This is only for our team, for Ferrari. It doesn’t exist anywhere else. And that’s what makes it very, very special. And Fiorano is also a very special place to do a car reveal, it’s never been done since I’m at Ferrari.”











            Ferrari last won an F1 title in 2008, when it claimed the constructors' championship. It hasn't won the drivers’ title since Kimi Räikkönen did so the previous season.

            Leclerc went close last year, winning two of the three opening races — the team’s first Grand Prix victories since 2019 — but he ultimately finished 146 points behind champion Max Verstappen.

            “I mean, 2022 was a good step forward compared to the two difficult years that was 2020 and 2021,” Leclerc said. “But we finished second in the constructors’ championship and also finished second in the drivers’ championship.

            “So I’m really, really looking forward to this new car … the goal is to win, clearly. I mean, the feeling of winning is what motivates me, motivates all the team, too. So I’m really looking forward to get back in the car and hopefully try and win that championship.”

            Preseason testing takes place in Bahrain from Feb. 23-25 and the season starts there on March 5.

            But, in contrast to the usual static car presentations in F1, the two Ferrari drivers got a chance to drive the new car for the first time on the track on Tuesday.

            The previous day, team principal Frédéric Vasseur had tossed a coin — with Leclerc’s number on one side and Sainz’s on the other — to see which driver would go first.

            Leclerc went first but only got two laps, with Sainz getting three. Leclerc enjoyed it so much he wanted to continue.

            “I love it. Everything feels good. … Can I do one more lap?” he asked over team radio.

            Sainz responded with a laugh: “No. Box, box, box.”

            Vasseur started work at Ferrari last month after replacing Mattia Binotto, who was let go following a horrible season of botched strategy calls that cost Leclerc any chance to contend for the championship.

            “So far it’s intense, as you can imagine,” Vasseur said. “You can feel the responsibility for the team. It’s a great honor but at the end of the day, I think the most important is to be successful. We will have to deliver.""

            After Brugge won the Belgian league title for the third season in a row in May — and the 18th time overall — with an enthralling attacking brand of football, hopes were high at the club that it was just the start of a soccer dynasty as strong as Bayern Munich's in Germany. 











            Placed in a tough Champions League group that also included Porto, Bayer Leverkusen and Atletico Madrid, Brugge lived up to expectations last autumn to advance to the the last 16 of the competition for the first time in three decades.

            Led by goalkeeper Simon Mignolet's 31 saves in the group phase, Brugge produced five clean sheet while developing clinical efficiency up front as prolific striker Ferran Jutgla blossomed into the team's attacking leader. 

            But like the rest of his teammates, the up-and-coming Spanish forward got trapped in a domestic downward spiral that started in November and has yet to be stopped.

            The club has won just two of their past 13 matches in all competitions and is 20 points behind league leader Genk. Looking for a jolt, club officials sacked previous coach Carl Hoefkens at the end of December to replace him with Parker, but the move has so far failed to bring a resurgence.

            It has, however, restored stability as Parker drew five of his seven matches in charge, including an encouraging and lively 1-1 draw last week against second-place Union Saint Gilloise in a game with many scoring chances. 

            “Things are moving in the right direction,” said center-back Jack Hendry ahead of Benfica's visit to Jan Breydelstadion.

            Parker had been out of work since being fired by Bournemouth in August. His ill-fated stint at Bournemouth included a 9-0 mauling at the hands of Liverpool that led to his dismissal following his comments about a lack of depth in the squad.

            Parker seems to have left criticism behind since he settled in the “Venice of the North,"" despite mustering just one league win so far. 

            “What I can say is that I found a group disappointed with its results, but very receptive, with a great desire to progress,"" he told Le Soir newspaper. “I didn’t arrive in a club where the foundations were in sand, but it was necessary to consolidate all that, by working a lot. It takes time. At six years old, my son would have liked to learn to ride a bike in half an hour. That’s not possible.”

            The Benfica test will show whether Parker has truly reinforced the foundations. Benfica is unbeaten in its last seven games in the Champions League, with four wins and three draws. It is trying to win three games in a row in the European competition for the first time since the 2005-06 season.

            Despite losing Enzo Fernández following his high-profile move to Chelsea, German coach Roger Schmidt still can count on forward Gonçalo Guedes, and also possibly on new signings Casper Tengstedt and Andreas Schjelderup. Out injured is left back Mihailo Ristic.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810246,"$50M shrine to honor slain priest, first US Catholic martyr","OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — The birth of Stanley Francis Rother was by all accounts ordinary, aside from the weather. The Catholic farm boy came into the world during an Oklahoma dust storm.

            But in life – and in death – he was extraordinary. 

            The 46-year-old priest, shot to death in Guatemala in 1981, became the first person born in the United States to be declared a martyr by the Catholic Church.











            Now a $50 million shrine built to honor the slain missionary — killed by three masked assassins who entered his rectory during Guatemala’s civil war — is expected to draw thousands of pilgrims to his home state.

            “People from all over the world can come and know more about him and really ask for his intercession,” said María Ruiz Scaperlanda, author of “The Shepherd Who Didn’t Run,” a 2015 biography of Rother.

            A dedication Mass set for Friday will mark the official opening of the Blessed Stanley Rother Shrine in Oklahoma City. The Spanish colonial-style structure incorporates a 2,000-seat sanctuary as well as a visitor center, gift shop, museum and smaller chapel that will serve as Rother’s final resting place. 

            The shrine grounds also will feature a re-creation of Tepeyac Hill, the Mexico City site where Catholics believe the Virgin Mary appeared to an Indigenous Mexican man named Juan Diego in 1531. An artist created painted bronze statues of Our Lady of Guadalupe and St. Juan Diego — each weighing thousands of pounds — for the Oklahoma site.

            Catholic donors funded the shrine, which was constructed debt free, Oklahoma City Archbishop Paul S. Coakley said. 

            “I think there are a lot of different things that will draw people to the campus, whether to honor Mary or Juan Diego or Blessed Stanley Rother,” Coakley said. “We hope it’s an opportunity for people to experience faith and grow in their relationship with the Lord.”

            The Oklahoma complex joins nearly 120 Catholic national and diocesan shrines in 27 states and the District of Columbia, according to the National Association of Shrine and Pilgrimage Apostolate.

            Prior to becoming the Rother shrine’s executive director in 2020, Leif Arvidson oversaw the Shrine of Our Lady of Guadalupe in La Crosse, Wisconsin, for a decade. About 75,000 pilgrims visited each year, Arvidson said.

            He declined to estimate how many visitors the Rother shrine might attract.

            “We’re still somewhat of a minority here,” Arvidson said of Oklahoma’s Catholic population.

            Evangelical Protestants make up the largest share of the Bible Belt state’s adults at 47%, according to the Pew Research Center. Mainline Protestants follow at 18%. Catholics are next at 8%.

            “I think he’ll be really special not only to Catholics but to Oklahomans and just people who will recognize the beauty of the virtues that he exhibited — of service and humility and dedication to God’s call in a person’s life,"" Arvidson said. 

            Zac Craig, the Oklahoma City Convention and Visitors Bureau president and a Southern Baptist, echoed Arvidson’s assessment.

            “It really adds to the cultural mix of diverse attractions that we have. … I think it’s going to be appealing to all,” said Craig, citing the city’s new First Americans Museum as well as the national memorial for the 1995 bombing of a federal office building.

            Rother’s story begins with his 1935 birth in Okarche, a small town about 40 miles northwest of Oklahoma City. 

            While he served as an altar boy at his hometown Holy Trinity Catholic Church, Rother seemed destined for farm life. He studied vocational agriculture in high school, while his brother, Tom, took a Latin course – a language long associated with Catholicism. 

            Family members couldn’t help but chuckle when Stan — not Tom — later became a clergyman. But the road to the priesthood proved a struggle. He dropped out of his first seminary but eventually graduated from another before his ordination in 1963. 

            He served several Oklahoma parishes before volunteering for mission work in Santiago Atitlán, Guatemala, in 1968.

            During his 13 years in the Central American nation, the priest who once had trouble with Latin learned Spanish and his parishioners’ Tzʼutujil language. He worked to translate the New Testament’s Gospels into the native dialect.

            Amid political and military unrest in the late 1970s, parishioners began disappearing, their bodies found dumped on roadsides. By 1981, Rother knew he was on a “hit list,” according to the Oklahoma City archdiocese. 

            His last visit home came a few months before his July 28, 1981, murder. He accepted an invitation to watch his younger cousin, the Rev. Don Wolf, join the priesthood and celebrate his first Mass as a priest that May.

            “We talked a lot about the dangers that he faced,” recalled Wolf, now 67.

            But Rother insisted on returning to Guatemala, telling loved ones, “The shepherd cannot run.”

            Rother became one of at least 13 Catholic priests killed during the war, branded as communists in collusion with left-wing revolutionary guerrillas.

            Now his cousin will serve as the shrine’s first rector. Besides welcoming pilgrims, the new church will become the worship place for two of the city’s growing Hispanic parishes. They will combine into one — relieving crowding at existing facilities.

            Wolf said it’s an exciting time — both for the memory of his cousin and the chance to grow the church in a state with a rising Latino population.

            “Stan has become this incredible character,” Wolf said of the stories told about Rother. “I’ve always been proud to be a part of his family. But I’ve always felt more closely connected to Stan because I’m a priest of the Archdiocese of Oklahoma City than because he has the same last name as my mother.”

            In December 2016, Pope Francis officially recognized Rother as a martyr. In September 2017, in the final step before sainthood, Rother was beatified at a special Mass that drew about 20,000 people, making him the first U.S. priest to be beatified.

            For Rother to become a saint, a miracle involving his intercession must be verified.

            “It’s a very rigorous process,"" Coakley said. “The church tends to be very skeptical about claims of miraculous healings, until they can be proven that they’re not attributable to science or anything else.”

            “It could be a long while,” the archbishop added. “It may never happen, for all we know, because we can’t predict how God is going to act.”

            Scaperlanda, Rother’s biographer and an Oklahoma City Catholic, said she loves that a boy reared in humble circumstances in Middle America has a shrine named after him.

            “He’s ordinary in that sense, and I think that’s one of the invaluable gifts he gives us,” she said. “If he can do it, then I can live out my best life that God put me here to do. I mean, I don’t have to be martyred like he was, but to give myself so fully to something, that’s a value that I want. 

            “I can ask Father Stan to help me live as he did.”

The AP is solely responsible for this content.OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — The birth of Stanley Francis Rother was by all accounts ordinary, aside from the weather. The Catholic farm boy came into the world during an Oklahoma dust storm.But in life – and in death – he was extraordinary.The 46-year-old priest, shot to death in Guatemala in 1981, became the first person born in the United States to be declared a martyr by the Catholic Church.Now a $50 million shrine built to honor the slain missionary — killed by three masked assassins who entered his rectory during Guatemala’s civil war — is expected to draw thousands of pilgrims to his home state.“People from all over the world can come and know more about him and really ask for his intercession,” said María Ruiz Scaperlanda, author of “The Shepherd Who Didn’t Run,” a 2015 biography of Rother.A dedication Mass set for Friday will mark the official opening of the Blessed Stanley Rother Shrine in Oklahoma City. The Spanish colonial-style structure incorporates a 2,000-seat sanctuary as well as a visitor center, gift shop, museum and smaller chapel that will serve as Rother’s final resting place.The shrine grounds also will feature a re-creation of Tepeyac Hill, the Mexico City site where Catholics believe the Virgin Mary appeared to an Indigenous Mexican man named Juan Diego in 1531. An artist created painted bronze statues of Our Lady of Guadalupe and St. Juan Diego — each weighing thousands of pounds — for the Oklahoma site.Catholic donors funded the shrine, which was constructed debt free, Oklahoma City Archbishop Paul S. Coakley said.“I think there are a lot of different things that will draw people to the campus, whether to honor Mary or Juan Diego or Blessed Stanley Rother,” Coakley said. “We hope it’s an opportunity for people to experience faith and grow in their relationship with the Lord.”The Oklahoma complex joins nearly 120 Catholic national and diocesan shrines in 27 states and the District of Columbia, according to the National Association of Shrine and Pilgrimage Apostolate.Prior to becoming the Rother shrine’s executive director in 2020, Leif Arvidson oversaw the Shrine of Our Lady of Guadalupe in La Crosse, Wisconsin, for a decade. About 75,000 pilgrims visited each year, Arvidson said.He declined to estimate how many visitors the Rother shrine might attract.“We’re still somewhat of a minority here,” Arvidson said of Oklahoma’s Catholic population.Evangelical Protestants make up the largest share of the Bible Belt state’s adults at 47%, according to the Pew Research Center. Mainline Protestants follow at 18%. Catholics are next at 8%.“I think he’ll be really special not only to Catholics but to Oklahomans and just people who will recognize the beauty of the virtues that he exhibited — of service and humility and dedication to God’s call in a person’s life,"" Arvidson said.Zac Craig, the Oklahoma City Convention and Visitors Bureau president and a Southern Baptist, echoed Arvidson’s assessment.“It really adds to the cultural mix of diverse attractions that we have. … I think it’s going to be appealing to all,” said Craig, citing the city’s new First Americans Museum as well as the national memorial for the 1995 bombing of a federal office building.Rother’s story begins with his 1935 birth in Okarche, a small town about 40 miles northwest of Oklahoma City.While he served as an altar boy at his hometown Holy Trinity Catholic Church, Rother seemed destined for farm life.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810247,"Post-Roe, Native Americans face even more abortion hurdles","A few months after South Dakota banned abortion last year, April Matson drove more than nine hours to take a friend to a Colorado clinic to get the procedure.

            The trip brought back difficult memories of Matson’s own abortion at the same clinic in 2016. The former grocery store worker and parent of two couldn’t afford a hotel and slept in a tent near a horse pasture — bleeding and in pain.

            Getting an abortion has long been extremely difficult for Native Americans like Matson. It has become even tougher since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. 











            New, restrictive state laws add to existing hurdles: a decades-old ban on most abortions at clinics and hospitals run by the federal Indian Health Service, fewer nearby health centers offering abortions, vast rural expanses for many to travel, and poverty afflicting more than a quarter of the Native population.

            “That’s a lot of barriers,” said Matson, who lives in Sioux Falls and is Sicangu Lakota. “We’re already an oppressed community, and then we have this oppression on top of that oppression.”

            Among the six states with the highest proportion of Native American and Alaska Native residents, four – South Dakota, Oklahoma, Montana and North Dakota – have moved or are poised to further restrict abortion. South Dakota and Oklahoma ban it with few exceptions.

            In some communities, the distance to the nearest abortion provider has increased by hundreds of miles, said Lauren van Schilfgaarde, a member of Cochiti Pueblo in New Mexico who directs the tribal legal development clinic at the University of California-Los Angeles.

            “Native people are having to cross massive, massive distances and absorb all of the travel costs and child care,” she said.

            Experts say the issue should be seen within the larger context of the tortured history between Indigenous people and white society that began with the taking of Native lands and includes coerced sterilization of Native women lasting into the 1970s. Native Americans on both sides of the abortion debate invoke this history — some arguing the procedure reduces the number of potential citizens in a population that has been threatened for centuries, and others saying new restrictions are another attack on Native women's rights.

            Many advocates worry that reduced abortion access will make things even worse for women already facing maternal death rates twice as high as their white peers, teen birth rates more than twice as high as whites, and the worst rates of sexual violence. 

            “Indigenous women don’t have access to reproductive justice in any form, and that includes abortion,” said Natalie Stites Means, a member of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe who serves on the board of the Justice Empowerment Network, an abortion fund. “Any limitation on our health care and any limitation on abortion is going to impact our health and well-being.”

            DECADES OF RESTRICTIONS

            For centuries, experts said, Indigenous people had their own systems of health care, which in some cases included natural abortive practices.

            Today, the main source of care for many is the Indian Health Service, which serves 2.6 million American Indians and Alaska Natives who belong to 574 federally recognized tribes in 37 states. Its clinics and hospitals operate under the Hyde Amendment, which bars them from using federal funds for abortions except in cases of rape, incest or threats to a mother’s life. 

            Even when an IHS patient falls under one of those exceptions, many facilities ""don’t have the materials or staff or the expertise to provide that abortion care,"" van Schilfgaarde said.

            Matson uses the pronoun they and is two-spirit, a term used to describe those who combine traits of both men and women. Matson, who lived in Rapid City at the time, said IHS staff didn't discuss abortion as an option for their unplanned pregnancy. After getting the procedure at 13 weeks in Colorado, they felt uncomfortable returning to IHS despite ongoing bleeding.

            While IHS staff can refer people to places that provide abortions, federal funds can only be used for “Hyde-permitted” procedures and related patient travel, agency officials said in a statement. And a federal report shows nearly 1 in 5 American Indians and Alaska Natives are uninsured.

            Also, there are often no abortion providers nearby. One reason? The proportion of Catholic health systems, which generally prohibit abortion, has grown significantly. A 2020 report by Community Catalyst, a nonprofit health advocacy organization, found that 1 in 6 acute care hospital beds in the U.S. is in a Catholic system. The share is 40% in South Dakota and 32% in Oklahoma.

            SEEKING SOLUTIONS

            After Roe fell, restrictive “trigger” laws took effect in more than a dozen states, including South Dakota and Oklahoma, which already had stopped providing most abortions. North Dakota's abortion ban has been blocked in court. 

            Some Native women were inspired to organize.

            Cherokee women in Tahlequah, Oklahoma, gathered over the summer to discuss a possible amendment to the tribe’s constitution protecting reproductive health access for its citizens. They were frustrated that leaders of this tribe with around 450,000 citizens hadn’t addressed the issue.

            “Fear was just kind of palpable,” said group leader Alissa Baker, who teaches psychology at Northeastern State University. “We felt a need to protect our community ... and really in some ways reclaim some of those traditional roles of a Cherokee woman, which is effectively being the voice of the community.”

            But the effort stalled as the school year approached, with members spread across a rural area, busy with jobs and children.

            Other activist efforts panned out. D’Arlyn Bell, a doctoral student at the University of Kansas and another member of the Cherokee Nation, joined with other Native activists to help defeat a proposed amendment to the Kansas state constitution that would have cleared the way for tougher abortion restrictions.

            “We were doing it not only for the Native women in our own states but Native women from our own home territories, especially Oklahoma,” she said.

            Experts stress that abortion views vary among tribal leaders and members – something echoed in a statement from the Cherokee Nation, the only one of the five largest tribes in South Dakota and Oklahoma to respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press.

            Opening a clinic on tribal land would be legally challenging, experts said. The Cherokee Nation said it wouldn’t set one up, and there have been no announcements from other tribes since Roe was overturned. History shows the issue is fraught: The first woman president of the Oglala Sioux Tribe in South Dakota was impeached in 2006 after publicly proposing an abortion clinic on the reservation.

            Post-Roe, Native Americans on both sides of the issue are taking personal and collective action.

            Elizabeth Terrill, a board member for the anti-abortion Native American nonprofit Life is Sacred, said she’s a foster parent, does post-abortion counseling and supports moms. She said extended families on tribal lands historically have banded together when there is an unplanned pregnancy, and most women choose to continue them. 

            “I think there’s just a different cultural understanding of what life is and when life begins and why life is so sacred,” said Terrill, a mental health therapist near the Navajo Nation in New Mexico and member of the Osage Nation of Oklahoma.

            Matson, executive director of the summer camp “Rock the Rez,” said they share their experience, donate money to those in need and tell others about resources like the Justice Empowerment Network, which covered most of their friend’s abortion and travel costs.

            “Every time someone is going through this, I offer support,” said Matson, 32. “I’ve helped, I hope, in every way that I can.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810248,LaQuan Smith brings showstopping Hollywood glamour to NYFW,"NEW YORK (AP) — Looking down on the New York Fashion Week crowd, model Frida Aasen dramatically flung her LaQuan Smith shearling coat from the balcony of the ritzy Rockefeller Center Rainbow Room and emerged down the cascading staircase following the infamous words of “Dynasty"" actress Joan Collins:

            “I now own this house.""

            While the display was intended to evoke the ’80s Hollywood glamour inspiration behind Smith’s Monday night show, it was also a subtle reminder to his attendees that this was a house that LaQuan Smith has built from the ground up into a global luxury brand launching with Bergdorf Goodman and Neiman Marcus. 











            As Aasen descended with a briefcase, fashion week attendees got a close-up look at the artful tailoring of the neckline of her little black mini dress. Smith told The Associated Press that his collection was inspired by the nostalgia of the “Dynasty"" television series and James Bond films. 

            “I wanted to create a collection that really focused on tailoring menswear suits, sharp clean lines that still create a sense of edge, sophistication and sex appeal,” Smith said after the show. 

            One by one, models descended the staircase in his beautifully impressive designs — from the black sheer dress with a plunging neckline and black satin bottom that rose at the hips and dipped below the belly button to the dazzling dress draped with black fringe. 

            It was only fitting that as Smith displayed his menswear pieces that rapper and red carpet style star Lil Nas X was sitting in the front row. In a refreshing take on menswear, Smith’s latest pieces included a double-breasted men’s suit jacket that was cropped at the hips while another look featured a sheer black button down with a neck tie under a black suit jacket. 

            Smith departed from his use of bright colors last season to incorporate warmer rich tones, from the body-hugging, velvety eggplant-colored evening wear dress to the olive full-length bodysuit and ivory trousers paired with a sheer blouse. Smith mixed in some patterns, including a sheer chiffon polka-dot dress and a form-fitting, nude-and-black striped dress. 

            “This collection is really rich in texture, and it screams luxury quality,” Smith said. 

            When asked what’s next for the brand, Smith said he plans on debuting his accessories line soon. At the show Monday, models donned large heart-shaped pendants and futuristic oversized sunglasses. 

            The significance of Smith’s rise to success and his latest show at the Rainbow Room was not lost on his guests. 

            “I don’t think people really understand how big of a deal that they expect someone to come and have a show here because the Rainbow Room is very exclusive and that is historical in many movies and parties we might have seen in the good old days,” supermodel Coco Rocha said. 

            Along with Rocha, front row celebrities at the event included singer Teyana Taylor, actor and fashion muse Julia Fox and Ashley Biden, daughter of U.S. President Joe Biden. 

            “Fashion designers are like the vanguards of innovation, and I love his clothes,” Biden said.

            Other confirmed candidates have been quiet, though that is likely to change after Friday.

            Merchant bank Raine Group is handling the process a year after overseeing the sale of Chelsea, which commanded the biggest ever price for a soccer team when bought for $3 billion by a consortium led by Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital.

            That price was driven up by interest from around the world, with U.S.-based bidders particularly eager to take control of one of the biggest clubs in the world and gain a stake in soccer’s most popular league.

            Chicago Cubs owner the Ricketts family, Boston Celtics part-owner Steve Pagliuca and New York Jets owner Woody Johnson were all in contention, while there was also a reported bid from Saudi Arabia, as well as British-based interest.

            With United anticipated to command double the price of Chelsea, the shortlist of serious buyers is likely to be even more exclusive.

            Ratcliffe declared himself a contender despite stating last year that he had dropped all interest in owning a Premier League club after missing out on Chelsea and being given little encouragement from the Glazer family, the current American owners.

            That all changed, however, when the Glazers, who also own the NFL's Tampa Bay Buccaneers, announced in November that it was pursuing outside funding. While that has led to speculation about who could afford to buy out the family, 18 years after late patriarch Malcolm Glazer bought United, partial investment has also been explored.

            It is uncertain, however, if investors would be willing to inject the sort of funds that may be required to build a new stadium without having overall control of the club.

            The cost of redeveloping or rebuilding United’s iconic Old Trafford stadium is widely considered to be a key reason why the Glazers are willing to sell after long-resisting campaigns from fans to drive them out. It could cost in excess of $1 billion to build a new stadium.

            The club’s training ground could also require investment, as well as a squad that has been unable to keep pace with rival Manchester City, which is owned by Abu Dhabi’s ruling family.

            A sovereign wealth fund has long-been considered a likely bidder and reported interest from Qatar has gathered pace in recent weeks. The Gulf country already backs Paris Saint-Germain through Qatar Sports Investments and any bid for United would have to come from a separate entity to meet UEFA ownership rules on teams competing in the same tournament.

            According to reports, a buyout of United would come from the Qatar Investment Authority.

            If a bid comes from Qatar, then Ratcliffe, a boyhood United fan and said to be worth $15.1 billion, would face a considerable challenge to compete.

            It's a different story for Musk, however, who is said to be worth $187.2 billion. Fresh from buying Twitter for $44 billion last year, a move for United would be relative small change.

            He sent the social media platform into a frenzy last August when he tweeted: “I’m buying Manchester United ur welcome.”

            He quickly added that it was a “long-running joke on Twitter,” but rumors have persisted.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810267,Cambodia's ties with West threatened by media clampdown,"Attacks on opposition and activists are escalating in Cambodia, with the forced closure of Voice of Democracy (VOD) this week coming as Prime Minister Hun Sen is hosting German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier.Hun Sen has been in power since 1985. The 70-year-old is expected to lead his ruling party through a largely-uncontested general election in July, with some speculating that he would later hand over power to his eldest son Hun Manet, the country's de-facto military chief.Many analysts believe that the clampdown on Voice of Democracy (VOD) was an attempt to silence one of the country's last remaining independent voices.Amnesty International's Hana Young  decried the affair as ""a blatant attempt to slam the door on what's left of independent media in the country"" and urged the prime minister to ""withdraw this heavy-handed and disproportionate order.""The ban was announced the same day that Germany's Steinmeier arrived in the capital Phnom Penh to start his Asian tour and the move is likely to raise questions about recent European rapprochement with Cambodia. The German president's itinerary includes a meeting with Hun Sen.A spokesperson for the German Foreign Ministry told DW they are ""deeply concerned"" about the closure of VOD.""Cambodia is losing an important independent voice,"" they added. ""This is bad news for press freedom and democracy. We hope that Voice of Democracy can resume its work soon.""The media ban followed a VOD report on February 9 which quoted government spokesperson Phay Siphan saying that Hun Sen's son and nominated successor, Hun Manet, had approved a government decision to donate around €93,000 ($100,000) in aid to Turkey after its recent earthquake.The government denied that Hun Manet made this decision, with Hun Sen insisting that only he, and not his son, has the authority to decide on foreign aid. The prime minister demanded an apology. Manet, who is deputy commander-in-chief of the Cambodian military and not an elected official, also rejected the narrative.VOD admitted to making a mistake, which was apparently due to the radio station erroneously quoting the spokesperson who was speaking about a separate matter.The Cambodian Center for Independent Media, an NGO which oversees VOD and receives EU funding, issued a statement expressing its ""regret"" for the confusion. But this was not enough for the government. Following the ban, Cambodia's Information Minister Kanharith Khieu wrote on Facebook that VOD's demise should be ""a lesson for other media outlets.""Clamping down on government opponents is not rare in Cambodia. In 2017, the government forcibly dissolved the Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP), the largest opposition force at the time, on spurious accusations that it was plotting a US-backed coup. Several news outlets were also closed in the run-up to the 2018 elections. In recent months, there was increased pressure on  another anti-government faction, the Candlelight Party. This included defamation suits ending in heavy fines.Hun Sen, a former Khmer Rouge commander, has threatened to dissolve any political challenger that he deems a threat to peace and which is deemed to ""slander"" the ruling party.The EU was strident in its criticism of Cambodia's democratic deterioration after 2017, which included the forced closure of other independent newspapers, including the outspoken Cambodia Daily that was shuttered on tax allegations. Brussels also suspended funding for Cambodia's general election in 2018 and eventually revoked some of the country's trading privileges in 2020.The US has also criticized Cambodia, although its remarks were focused more on its ties with China. Washington believes Phnom Penh will allow the Chinese military access to its large naval base on the Gulf of Thailand. Hun Sen's government has consistently denied that it has any secret naval base agreement with China.And yet, Cambodia's relations with Western democracies improved somewhat over the past 12 months. Hun Sen received praise for backing Western condemnations of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and Cambodia even co-sponsored a UN General Assembly resolution against Moscow.On the economic front, Cambodia's exports to the EU rose by 25% to around €3.7 billion last year, according to a recent statement by Cambodia's Commerce Ministry. The Asian country has also recently been the recipient of several funding packages from the European Investment Bank.The ban on VOD has prompted criticism from the EU delegation in Cambodia and the embassies of a dozen EU member states. In a joint statement, European diplomats said the closure ""seriously undermines media freedom and pluralism, which are essential for any open and free society.""In response, a Cambodian Foreign Ministry spokesman was quoted by local media as saying such comments from foreign embassies express ""politically-driven, prejudiced and biased concerns.""It is not yet clear if the escalating clampdown would affect the gradual rapprochement between Cambodia and the West. Most analysts expect the EU to wait and see the conduct of July's general election before reassessing their options.At the very least, the closure of a leading news outlet is likely to color the EU's opinion ahead of the ballot.""The presence of free media is part of the environment in which the elections will be held and judged upon,"" a senior European official told DW.Edited by: Darko Janjevic",2023/02/14,,

We are still learning about its magnitude. Its true cost is not known yet,"" WHO regional director for Europe, Hans Kluge said at a press conference.The comments come as the hopes of finding more survivors from the earthquakes, which struck over a week ago, fade.Turkey is among the 53 countries listed in the WHO's European Region, while neighboring Syria is in the Eastern Mediterranean region.Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD) on Tuesday said that the number of dead has risen to 31,974.Volunteer rescue group Syria Civil Defense — also known has The White Helmets — said the death toll had reached 2,166 in opposition-held areas, while the Syrian Health Ministry in Damascus said 1,414 people have died in government-held areas.The latest figures bring the total number killed in the disaster to over 35,000.Here are other updates from Tuesday, February 14, on the aftermath of the deadly earthquakes:The AFP news agency reported that the first UN delegation to visit rebel-held northwestern Syria since last week's earthquake, crossed over from Turkey.""A multi-agency mission has gone this morning from the Turkey side across the border crossing... It's largely an assessment mission,"" the World Food Programme's Syria director, Kenn Crossley, told AFP in Geneva.On Monday, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres welcomed Syrian President Bashar Assad's decision to open two further crossings on the border with Turkey, allowing more aid into the region following the deadly earthquakes in the region.The UN, meanwhile, has been under pressure to act over the slow pace of aid to the quake-stricken region.UN children's agency UNICEF said that more than 7 million children have been affected by the Turkey-Syria earthquake and expressed fear over the thousands who have died.""In Turkey, the total number of children living in the 10 provinces hit by the two earthquakes was 4.6 million children. In Syria, 2.5 million children are affected,"" UNICEF spokesperson James Elder told reporters in Geneva.""UNICEF fears many thousands of children have been killed,"" Elder said, warning that ""even without verified numbers, it is tragically clear that numbers will continue grow.""Given the rising death toll, Elder said it was clear that ""many, many children will have lost parents in these devastating earthquakes.""""It will be a terrifying figure,"" he added.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said that Syrian President Bashar Assad had agreed to allow UN aid deliveries to opposition-held northwest Syria through two additional border crossings from Turkey for three months.Turkey's presidential office said the earthquakes has left 1.2 million people in southern Turkey homeless.The German government said it wants to temporarily ease visa restrictions for survivors of the earthquake in Turkey and Syria. The easing of rules would apply to those who have close family ties to Germany if they are facing homelessness or were injured.kb/rs (AFP, AP, Reuters, dpa)",2023/02/14,,

But for all the wrong reasons. Real Madrid's win over Liverpool in Paris became a side show to scenes around the stadium, with Liverpool fans crushed, mugged and attacked, legitimate tickets rejected and innocent fans pepper sprayed by aggressive French riot police.""The panel has concluded that UEFA, as event owner, bears primary responsibility for failures which almost led to disaster,'' said a report officially released by UEFA's own investigators on Monday. ""It is remarkable that no one lost their life,"" it continued.UEFA, which also oversaw chaotic finals of the Europa League in Seville in 2022 and the Euros final in London the previous year, eventually delayed the kickoff but blamed Liverpool fans in a public announcement shown on stadium screens. In reality, thousands had been forced into a crush outside the stadium despite arriving hours before kickoff.Many fans were fired upon with tear gas by police before the game, which was eventually delayed by nearly 40 minutes. After Madrid's 1-0 win, many were robbed and attacked leaving the stadium by local residents in the Paris suburb of Saint-Denis, where the stadium is located.On Monday, UEFA General Secretary Theodore Theodoridis apologized to the English club's fans for UEFA having laid the blame on them initially then doubling down by reporting that about 40,000 Liverpool fans were using fake tickets. This was not the case and no evidence was ever presented suggesting it could have been.The panel, appointed seven months ago by UEFA, also laid blame at the door of UEFA's commercial subsidiary UEFA Events and French public authorities, including the police. UEFA delegated many security matters to local authorities but French riot police are notoriously tough on football fans, with few fans allowed to travel to away games in the country.""UEFA's lack of oversight upon delegation of private safety and security matters, deference of all such matters in the public space to policing authorities, and simply not following its own safety, security and service requirements, was a recipe for the failures that occurred,'' read the report. ""Senior officials at the top of UEFA allowed this to happen, even though the shortcomings of its model were widely known at senior management level.''Paris Police Chief Didier Lallement apologized weeks after the final for the heavy-handed and sometimes brutal actions of the French police, still Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin remains in place despite heavy criticism of his part in the fiasco.The report also said ""key stakeholders"" had been slow to take the blame, which is particularly concerning given the Stade de France will be a key venue at this year's rugby World Cup and next year's Paris Olympics.Liverpool play Real Madrid again in the Champions League next Tuesday and a law firm representing more than 600 Liverpool fans say they should be entitled to compensation.""Liverpool fans have waited eight months for answers as to how and why the horrific events they experienced on May 28, 2022, unfolded,"" Clare Campbell and Jill Paterson, partners at Leigh Day, said. ""At this stage, we still strongly believe that UEFA need to compensate Liverpool fans for their experience.""Fan group Spirit of Shankly welcomed the findings of the report of a night they described as a ""maelstrom of chaos and alarm that led to some fans fearing for their lives.""""The fans have been exonerated,"" their statement continued. ""A breakdown in communication on the day, the failures of UEFA, the French police and authorities were to blame. The shame — beginning with the stadium billboard announcing kick-off was delayed due to fans arriving late, supporters being tear gassed and pepper sprayed, pick-pocketed and attacked, people frightened they were going to die — is on them.""While France's issues with policing football are significant, Germany also has problems. In recent years, supporters have often faced difficulties entering football grounds and have dealt with various questionable security measures, mostly affecting away fans.In one case, hundreds of Werder Bremen supporters were held by police as they made way to their club's away game in Wolfsburg in August 2022, with police demanding they show personal documents despite not having committed any crimes.  According to Wolfsburg Police, the step was taken to ""prevent clashes between fan groups."" As a result, many Werder fans went home in protest. Both clubs criticized police handling of the supporters.Indeed, German Police measures have sometimes resulted in violence against supporters. Ahead of the Hamburg derby last October, footage of a police officer emerged in which he could be seen repeatedly hitting a St. Pauli fan who had been lying on the ground unable to move.  This came after police said they had stopped fans of the two clubs from clashing. In another case, a police officer was taken to court after he had kicked a Borussia Dortmund supporter while he was lying on the ground at the city’s main train station after the club's away derby against archrivals Schalke.In recent years, fan representatives in Germany have often called for authorities to stop placing football supporters under “general suspicion."" This was also a contributory factor in Paris last year, with a report from the French Ministry of Sports  wrongly linking hooliganism with the Hillsborough stadium disaster of 1989, in which nearly 100 people died as a result of inadequate policing. A cover-up of the events that led to the deaths has gone on for decades and is still unravelling.""It is shocking that more than 30 years after the Hillsborough disaster any club and our group of fans would be subject to such fundamental safety failings which have had such a devastating impact on so many,"" said Liverpool in a statement, which also called upon UEFA to enact the 21 recommendations of the report. ""But even more concerning is the realization that for families, friends and survivors of Hillsborough, Paris has only exacerbated their suffering.""Unlike at Hillsborough, many of the events of last May were captured on camera phones by fans and journalists, possibly forcing UEFA's hand.Edited by: Chuck Penfold",2023/02/14,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810273,Saint Vincent and the Grenadines embassy in Taiwan unveils reading room,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The Saint Vincent and Grenadines embassy on Tuesday (Feb. 14) held a ribbon-cutting ceremony for its newly opened reading room.

            The space is intended to “present and to attract a catalog of significant, informative and entertaining reading material in English for the Taiwanese and the English-speaking community in Taiwan,” Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Ambassador Andrea Bowman said in a speech.

            “The more one reads, the better one writes. The more one reads, the more one is able to compare, contrast and critically assess perspectives,” Bowman explained. “Active reading promotes deeper thought and reflection, which should then lead to more thoughtful actions,” she added.

            Occasionally, English language teachers can use the room to share selected readings with elementary to university-level students, Bowman said. She mentioned that the embassy is also open to other creative ways the space can be used.











            Anyone who would like to access the room can make an appointment with the embassy secretary and clear security on the first floor, she said.

            The reading room is part of the embassy’s efforts to help Taiwan achieve its 2030 bilingual goal, the ambassador said.

            Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Foreign Minister Keisal Peters praised Bowman and her staff for their hard work and said education “is a very important cornerstone” for the Caribbean nation. She mentioned the “education revolution” that is currently being promoted by Prime Minister Ralph Goncalves and said that one of the keys to this revolution is reading.

            Peters, who is in Taiwan for the Empower Women! Empower LAC! Forum on Feb. 15, told reporters after the ceremony that her goal for the meeting would be “presenting from the Vincentian perspective.”

            “What I hope to learn are new initiatives that other countries may have dabbled in and tried and whether they were successful, and to see if there can be a similar fit for SVG,” she said.

            She said that Saint Vincent and the Grenadines partnered with Taiwan for different initiatives for the empowerment of women. This includes training women to repair electronics and how to improve their small and medium enterprises.

            The foreign minister described Vincentians as resilient and hardworking people. She encouraged her fellow nationals in Taiwan to “continue to put (their) best foot forwards” and to continue to love and cooperate with the Taiwanese. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines has demonstrated its commitment to the government and people of Taiwan “at every step,” she said.

            When asked to give bilateral relations with Taiwan a letter grade, Peters immediately responded, “A+”

            Bowman said “there is a real genuineness” between Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and Taiwan. She noted that the two countries have had diplomatic relations for 42 years, which is “rare.”

            “We have a home away from home here,” she added.

            The reading room currently has a collection of 47 literary works all written by Vincentians, including Prime Minister Gonsalves.TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The Saint Vincent and Grenadines embassy on Tuesday (Feb. 14) held a ribbon-cutting ceremony for its newly opened reading room.The space is intended to “present and to attract a catalog of significant, informative and entertaining reading material in English for the Taiwanese and the English-speaking community in Taiwan,” Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Ambassador Andrea Bowman said in a speech.“The more one reads, the better one writes.

She mentioned that the embassy is also open to other creative ways the space can be used.Anyone who would like to access the room can make an appointment with the embassy secretary and clear security on the first floor, she said.The reading room is part of the embassy’s efforts to help Taiwan achieve its 2030 bilingual goal, the ambassador said.Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Foreign Minister Keisal Peters praised Bowman and her staff for their hard work and said education “is a very important cornerstone” for the Caribbean nation. She mentioned the “education revolution” that is currently being promoted by Prime Minister Ralph Goncalves and said that one of the keys to this revolution is reading.(Taiwan News, Kelvin Chen photo)Peters, who is in Taiwan for the Empower Women! Empower LAC! Forum on Feb. 15, told reporters after the ceremony that her goal for the meeting would be “presenting from the Vincentian perspective.”“What I hope to learn are new initiatives that other countries may have dabbled in and tried and whether they were successful, and to see if there can be a similar fit for SVG,” she said.She said that Saint Vincent and the Grenadines partnered with Taiwan for different initiatives for the empowerment of women. This includes training women to repair electronics and how to improve their small and medium enterprises.The foreign minister described Vincentians as resilient and hardworking people. She encouraged her fellow nationals in Taiwan to “continue to put (their) best foot forwards” and to continue to love and cooperate with the Taiwanese. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines has demonstrated its commitment to the government and people of Taiwan “at every step,” she said.When asked to give bilateral relations with Taiwan a letter grade, Peters immediately responded, “A+”Bowman said “there is a real genuineness” between Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and Taiwan. She noted that the two countries have had diplomatic relations for 42 years, which is “rare.”“We have a home away from home here,” she added.The reading room currently has a collection of 47 literary works all written by Vincentians, including Prime Minister Gonsalves.",2023/02/15,606,Culture

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810276,Cambodian leader says radio station closure is permanent,"PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) — A day after one of Cambodia’s few independent media outlets was shut at his order, Prime Minister Hun Sen declared Tuesday that Voice of Democracy radio will not be allowed to reopen despite pleas and protests from around the world.

            Voice of Democracy, better known as VoD, was closed on Monday after Hun Sen said it had not properly apologized for a story that he claimed had slandered his son, Lt. Gen. Hun Manet. The story said his son had signed a document on his father’s behalf authorizing a $100,000 donation for quake relief for Turkey.

            Hun Sen said the article misrepresented the facts and that only the prime minister has the authority to make decisions on foreign aid. VoD acknowledged it had made a mistake, but Hun Sen said its statement was unsatisfactory.











            Cambodia’s Information Ministry said Monday that VoD’s license was being revoked “because it has seriously violated the ethics of professional journalism and did not make a correction according to the press law, affecting the honor and prestige of the government.”

            Hun Sen has led Cambodia with an iron fist for 38 years, and has declared that he wants Hun Manet, who also is army commander, to succeed him.

            VoD has reported extensively on sensitive issues such as land grabbing and criminal gangs that operate with near impunity in carrying out internet scams using employees, especially foreigners, who are tricked into working under conditions of near slavery.

            The closing of VoD triggered a torrent of criticism from rights groups and some Western governments.

            Many noted that the action came ahead of a general election scheduled for July. There was a similar crackdown on the media ahead of the last election in 2018. At that time, a controversial court ruling before the polls also dissolved the only credible opposition force, the Cambodia National Rescue Party. Hun Sen’s Cambodian Peoples Party ended up winning all the seats in the National Assembly.

            “This is a blatant attempt to slam the door on what’s left of independent media in the country, and a clear warning to other critical voices months before national elections. The prime minister should immediately withdraw this heavy-handed and disproportionate order,"" said Amnesty International’s deputy regional director, Hana Young.

            U.S. State Department spokesperson Ned Price, speaking Monday to reporters in Washington, said the closure was “particularly troubling given the chilling impact it will have on freedom of expression and on access to information ahead of the national elections in July.”

            U.N. Human Rights chief Volker Türk likewise expressed alarm that VoD’s license had been revoked.

            “I call on the government of Cambodia to rescind this very troubling decision, to protect the civil and political rights of all, and to ensure an enabling environment for civil society, including independent media outlets,” he said in a statement.

            Hun Sen, in a statement posted Tuesday on the Telegram social messaging platform, warned foreign countries not to interfere in the internal affairs of Cambodia. He said he would not change his mind about closing VoD.

            “Shutting down one unprofessional radio station will not kill the freedom of expression in Cambodia, but moreover, it will help strengthen the professional journalism sector in Cambodia,” he said.

            Hun Sen said he was concerned that VoD staff members had lost their jobs because of what he described as the mistake of their leader, and that they will be given the chance to apply for jobs as civil servants in various government ministries according to their abilities.PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) — A day after one of Cambodia’s few independent media outlets was shut at his order, Prime Minister Hun Sen declared Tuesday that Voice of Democracy radio will not be allowed to reopen despite pleas and protests from around the world.Voice of Democracy, better known as VoD, was closed on Monday after Hun Sen said it had not properly apologized for a story that he claimed had slandered his son, Lt.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810283,Colts hire Eagles OC Shane Steichen as their head coach,"INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Shane Steichen accepted his dream job on Tuesday.

            Now, he's waiting to see if he gets to rebuild the Indianapolis Colts around the quarterback of his dreams.

            Team owner Jim Irsay ended a monthlong search that included interviews with more than a dozen candidates by hiring the 37-year-old, first-time head coach who has a penchant for turning promising young quarterbacks into stars.











            “We felt Shane had a lot of that offensive magic that can be hard to find, knowing we’re going to have a young quarterback to develop,” Irsay said. “He had a presence and boy did it come through. Also his mind, thinking multiple things at once, disseminating those things quickly, I think he has a special mind for football.”

            Indy certainly needs a new perspective — and some stability — after missing the playoffs each of the past two seasons.

            Steichen becomes the Colts' fourth coach since 2017 and they're likely to be starting yet another different quarterback on opening day, extending their streak to seven straight seasons.

            Irsay and general manager Chris Ballard are now pinning their hopes on a gruff-looking, tough-talking coach who worked previously with Philip Rivers and helped mentor Justin Herbert of the Los Angeles Chargers and Jalen Hurts in Philadelphia.

            But for a few minutes during his introductory news conference, Steichen couldn't hide his emotions. His wife and two young children, along with a handful of current Indy players, watched Steichen choke back tears while offering thanks to everyone from family members to former players and coaching colleagues to team officials who employed him.

            “Right now, I’m a little emotional because this is a big day for me and my family,” Steichen said. “We want to get a lot of things done here and we’ve got to grind it every single day.”

            Steichen becomes the second straight former Eagles offensive coordinator to make a Super Bowl run and then leave days later for Indianapolis. Frank Reich took the same path in 2018 after Philadelphia won its first championship since 1960.

            Reich was fired in October as the Colts' season started to unravel and was replaced by interim coach Jeff Saturday, who won his first game but lost the final seven.

            The unusual decision to bring Saturday out of the broadcast studio to replace Reich was widely panned by critics who contended more qualified candidates already were on Indy’s staff and those who thought Irsay skirted NFL rules to include minority candidates in the hiring process.

            While those rules don’t apply to midseason changes, Ballard and Irsay promised to conduct an exhaustive, inclusive search that did meet the Rooney Rule requirements.

            Yet in a candidate pool that included former NFL head coach Raheem Morris, former Raiders interim coach Rich Bisaccia and two internal candidates — Saturday and special teams coordinator Bubba Ventrone — Steichen was hired for one obvious reason.

            Most draft analysts expect Indy to use the No. 4 overall draft pick on a quarterback, which drew some banter between Irsay and Ballard about their trading options and ended with a possible hint about Irsay's intention.

            “He (Ballard) likes picks, although the Alabama guy doesn’t look bad,” Irsay said, referring to Bryce Young.

            Indy has drafted only two quarterbacks in the first round over the past 25 years — Peyton Manning in 1998 and Andrew Luck in 2012, both with the top overall pick.

            There are also striking similarities between Steichen and Reich.

            Both progressed through the coaching ranks in similar ways, working together in San Diego with Rivers, and both were college quarterbacks though Steichen, unlike Reich, never took a snap in the NFL. They even seem to have similar philosophies.

            “I’m a gut-feeling guy especially on game day as a play-caller,” Steichen said. “We're going to be aggressive, but my philosophy on offense is we’re going to throw to score points and run to win. That may look different from week to week; flow is going to dictate that.”

            Still, Irsay wants different results.

            Steichen takes over a team that went 4-12-1 and used three starting quarterbacks, two play-callers and two head coaches. He becomes the third 37-year-old head coach in the NFL, the youngest being Sean McVay, who won last year's Super Bowl with the Los Angeles Rams.

            The most immediate priority, though, is putting together a staff. Steichen declined to say whether he would keep Gus Bradley as defensive coordinator or Ventrone.

            Steichen must figure out how to revamp an offensive line that had been among the league’s top units from 2018-21 but struggled mightily in 2022. Plus, Indy must decide what to do with veteran quarterbacks Matt Ryan and Nick Foles, who struggled last season.

            Ryan is just six days younger than Steichen and would count $35.2 million against the salary cap if he returns. Indy could save about $17 million by releasing him. Cutting Foles, the Super Bowl 52 MVP, would save the Colts about $2 million off his $3.6 million cap charge in 2023.

            Neither has said whether he plans to retire.

            But the Colts believe in Steichen.

            “High integrity, high character, brilliant football mind and philosophy,” Ballard said. “We see the game the same way and I think that’s important. We’re not going to always agree, we didn’t always agree in the interview, but we see the game the same way.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810284,18% drop since 2020 in people with reported medical debt,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The number of people with medical debt on their credit reports fell by 8.2 million — or 17.9% — between 2020 and 2022, according to a report Tuesday from the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. 

            White House officials said in a separate draft report that the two-year drop likely stems from their policies. Among the programs they say contributed to less debt was an expansion of the Obama-era healthcare law that added 4.2 million people with some form of health insurance. Also, local governments are leveraging $16 million in coronavirus relief funds to wipe out $1.5 billion worth of medical debt.

            There has also been a persistent effort by the CFPB to reduce medical debt. The major credit rating agencies said last year that they will no longer include in their reports medical debts under $500 or debts that were already repaid. The agencies will also extend the time it takes to add medical debt to reports from six months to one year, possibly giving families more time to repay before being penalized with lower credit scores.











            White House officials said the decline in debt could reduce fears about medical bills that can prevent people from making needed doctor appointments and filling pharmaceutical prescriptions.

            White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters at Tuesday's briefing that Biden's policies played “a critical role in reducing the burden of medical debt for millions of American families.”

            While economic measures such as the unemployment rate and inflation can swing up and down, the decline in medical debt shows that steady progress is being made. Some 13.5% of the 279 million people with credit reports had at least one medical debt, down from 16.4% in 2020 and 19.4% in 2014.

            Still, unpaid medical bills account for more than half of all debt in collections, according to the White House report. As a result, medical debt exceeds credit cards, personal loans and utilities and phone bills combined. 

            There is also evidence that the decline predates the Biden presidency. The amount of medical debt on credit reports fell to $111 billion from $143 billion between 2018 and the first half of 2021, according to a March 2022 report by the CFPB.

            But communities such as Chicago, New Orleans, Pittsburgh and Toledo, Ohio, are using $16 million in funds from the 2021 coronavirus relief to buy medical debt and forgive it. So far, the spending plans are eliminating $1.5 billion in medical debt, a ratio of about 100-to-1 for the expenditures by the local governments.WASHINGTON (AP) — The number of people with medical debt on their credit reports fell by 8.2 million — or 17.9% — between 2020 and 2022, according to a report Tuesday from the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.White House officials said in a separate draft report that the two-year drop likely stems from their policies.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810285,Biden names Fed vice chair Brainard to head Economic Council,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden on Tuesday named Federal Reserve Vice Chair Lael Brainard as the new director of his National Economic Council, making the Ph.D. economist a key point person for coordinating policy, talking with business leaders and negotiating with Congress.

            Biden also nominated longtime adviser Jared Bernstein to be chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers. Brainard and Bernstein would be moving into top spots at a crucial juncture for the U.S. economy. Unemployment is at 3.4%, near a 54-year low, but inflation remains persistently high at 6.4% and has contributed to fears of a coming recession.

            Brainard will succeed Brian Deese, who helped handle several key legislative wins for Biden, including coronavirus relief, infrastructure spending and investments in computer chip production. Her resignation from the Fed takes effect Feb. 20. 











            Brainard, 61, holds a doctoral degree in economics from Harvard University. During the Clinton administration, she worked as a deputy director for the National Economic Council. She was also under secretary for international affairs at Treasury during Barack Obama's presidency. Brainard joined the Fed in 2014 as a governor and Biden nominated her to become vice chair.

            She also forms half of an administration power couple, with her husband, Kurt Campbell, serving on the National Security Council as the administration's “Asian czar.”

            Bernstein, 67, is already a member of the Council of Economic Advisers, where he would succeed current chair Cecilia Rouse, who is returning to Princeton University. With an interest in labor markets and income inequality, Bernstein worked as a vice presidential aide for Biden during Obama's presidency. He received his doctoral degree in social welfare from Columbia University.

            Biden said Brainard “brings an extraordinary depth of domestic and international economic expertise” to the role and hailed Bernstein as a “brilliant thinker and one of my closest and longest-serving economic advisers.”

            Bernstein must be confirmed by the Senate. Brainard does not need to be confirmed.

            The president also expanded the role of Bharat Ramamurti, a deputy director at the National Economic Council who will become an adviser for strategic economic communications. Heather Boushey, a member of the Council of Economic Advisers, will also serve as chief economist to Biden's recently formed cabinet of advisers focused on investing in America. Joelle Gamble, chief economist at the Labor Department, will become a deputy director of the National Economic Council.

            Brainard’s departure from the Fed comes at a fraught time, as the central bank seeks to balance its fight against inflation without going so far as to cause a worse recession than necessary. Brainard has been a leading “dovish” voice, meaning she typically supports lower interest rates to bolster employment. (“Hawks” are more likely to push for higher rates to combat inflation). 

            She has worked closely with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, and comments from her speeches often find their way into subsequent formal statements by the Fed.

            In a speech last month, Brainard argued that taming inflation might not require the job market “pain,” in the form of widespread layoffs, that other Fed officials, including Powell, have warned about. Instead, she said that companies may be forced to reduce prices and cut their profit margins as consumer demand slows, which would help bring down inflation.

            However, Biden has appointed three other members of the Fed’s governing board, so Brainard’s departure will not deprive the central bank of dovish voices. 

            Brainard has also supported tougher financial regulations than Powell. When Randal Quarles was the Fed’s top financial regulator -- appointed by President Donald Trump -- Brainard cast about 20 dissenting votes on regulatory issues. 

            She has also expressed support for the idea that the Fed could do more to push banks to consider the risks posed by climate change to their financial health. Climate activists warn that increased damage to homes, commercial buildings, and other property will impose greater financial losses on banks and should be considered when evaluating their safety and soundness.

            Under Powell, who is not a trained economist, the Fed vice chair has typically been someone with a deep background in monetary economics, such as Richard Clarida, Brainard’s predecessor. Clarida was an economics professor at Columbia University and an adviser to PIMCO, a bond trading firm. 

            Bloomberg News first reported Monday that Brainard and Bernstein were set to become Biden’s top economic aides.WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden on Tuesday named Federal Reserve Vice Chair Lael Brainard as the new director of his National Economic Council, making the Ph.D. economist a key point person for coordinating policy, talking with business leaders and negotiating with Congress.Biden also nominated longtime adviser Jared Bernstein to be chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers.

            Course: Riviera CC. Yardage: 7,322. Par: 71.

            Prize money: $20 million. Winner's share: $3.6 million.

            Television: Thursday-Friday, 4-8 p.m. (Golf Channel); Saturday, 1-3 p.m. (Golf Channel), 3-7 p.m. (CBS); Sunday, 1-3 p.m. (Golf Channel), 3-6 p.m. (CBS).

            Previous winner: Joaquin Niemann.

            FedEx Cup leader: Jon Rahm.

            Last week: Scottie Scheffler won the WM Phoenix Open.

            Notes: Tournament host Tiger Woods is playing for the first time since the British Open. It's his first time competing in a regular PGA Tour event since the Zozo Championship in October 2020. ... This is the second straight elevated event with a $20 million purse and features everyone available from the top 20 in the world. Cameron Smith, now with LIV Golf and No. 4 in the world, is the only one missing. ... Scottie Scheffler is back to No. 1 in the world. That means for the 14th consecutive year, no one who starts a year at No. 1 will stay there for the entire year. Woods in 2009 was the last to do it. ... This is the third time in seven tournaments this year the previous winner is not back to defend his title. Joaquin Niemann, now with LIV Golf, won last year. ... Lanny Wadkins holds the 72-hole record at Riviera set in 1985 at 264. It's the oldest tournament scoring record on the PGA Tour. ... Riviera is the course Woods has played the most times (11 as a pro) without ever winning. His best finish was a tie for second in 1999.

            Next week: Honda Classic.

He leads the Schwab Cup by $500 over Steve Stricker, who won the season opener in Hawaii last month. Stricker is playing this week. ... Bernhard Langer has another chance this week to tie the PGA Tour Champions career victory record of 45 held by Hale Irwin. The 65-year-old German last won in November for his 44th win. ... Chubb is in its 25th year as title sponsor, the longest continuous title sponsor on the PGA Tour Champions. It announced an extension through 2025. ... This is the first Champions event on the U.S. mainland. After a week off, the circuit moves to the West Coast for three tournaments. ... Padraig Harrington makes his PGA Tour Champions debut in 2023. He spent the early part of the year on the European tour.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810289,Zambia grants bail to 8 Croatians on trafficking charges,"LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) — Eight Croatians facing charges of child trafficking have been granted bail of about $1,000 each by a court in Ndola in central Zambia.

            The charges allege that on December 7 last year the four couples acted together with a Zambian immigration official to try to traffic four children from the neighboring country of Congo, who are aged between one and three years old.

            The immigration official is also facing trafficking charges and had already been released on bail.











            The Croatians and the Zambian have all pleaded not guilty to the charges.

            The eight Croatians — four married couples — are eligible for bail and pose no flight risk as Zambian officials hold their passports, Magistrate Jennifer Bwalya said in the court Tuesday. 

            The child trafficking case is scheduled to begin on March 1, said the magistrate.

            The eight Croatians were first arrested and charged with child trafficking in January. The charges against them were dropped on Feb. 6 and they were ordered to leave Zambia within 48 hours. But when they were about to board a plane to leave the country, they were rearrested on fresh charges. They were were held in custody since they were rearrested on Feb. 7. 

            The Croatians facing charges include Zoran Subosic, 52, a guitarist in a well-known band Hladno Pivo, or Cold Beer, Immovic Subosic, 41, an administrator, Damir Magic, 44, an electrical technician, Nadic Magic, 45, a technician, Ladislav Persic, 42, a medical doctor, Aleksandra Persic, 43, a hair salon attendant, Noah Kraljevic, 40, a program director, and Uvona Kraljevic, 36, a dog handler.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810296,Bus in northern South Africa crashes with van; 20 dead,"JOHANNESBURG (AP) — A crash between a passenger bus and a van armored to carry cash in the northern province of Limpopo, South Africa has killed at least 20 people and injured 68, officials have reported.

            The two vehicles collided head-on along the N1 freeway in the Makhado area on Monday evening, according to paramedics who responded to the crash.

            The bus reportedly rolled down a slope to a river and some passengers were found trapped underneath.











            Three people by the highway were confirmed dead while 16 other bodies were found by the river where the bus had rolled, according to ER24 paramedics spokesman Ross Campbell.

            “Most of the fatalities down the river had been trapped under the bus,” said Campbell.

            One more person died after being taken to a hospital, he said. Others injured received treatment at the site with some being transported to nearby health facilities for further care, he said.

            While exact details surrounding the collision are unknown, heavy rains have been falling in the area, according to Campbell.

            Police investigators were still on the scene on Tuesday morning, said Campbell.JOHANNESBURG (AP) — A crash between a passenger bus and a van armored to carry cash in the northern province of Limpopo, South Africa has killed at least 20 people and injured 68, officials have reported.The two vehicles collided head-on along the N1 freeway in the Makhado area on Monday evening, according to paramedics who responded to the crash.The bus reportedly rolled down a slope to a river and some passengers were found trapped underneath.Three people by the highway were confirmed dead while 16 other bodies were found by the river where the bus had rolled, according to ER24 paramedics spokesman Ross Campbell.“Most of the fatalities down the river had been trapped under the bus,” said Campbell.One more person died after being taken to a hospital, he said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810299,Bill Gates joins 26 newcomers on list of 50 biggest donors,"As the ranks of America’s super wealthy grow, the roster of major philanthropists is expanding to include not-so-typical megadonors — among them, a professional clarinetist, a Ph.D. in meat science, and a lawyer who regularly argues before the U.S. Supreme Court.

            That’s according to a Chronicle of Philanthropy analysis of giving by the country’s 50 biggest donors in 2022. Twenty-six of the 50 are new to the Chronicle’s annual ranking, which dates to 2000. They include big names from business such as Airbnb’s Brian Chesky (who gave $100 million to the Obama Foundation), FedEx’s Fred Smith ($65 million to the Marine Corps Scholarship Foundation), and Roku founder Anthony Wood ($71.5 million to several charitable giving vehicles).

            Also, Jacklyn Bezos, mother of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, made her debut on the list with her husband, Miguel. The two gave $710.5 million to the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center.











            Other Philanthropy 50 first-timers, however, lack the national profile, the Silicon Valley address, or Wall Street credentials that are commonplace in today’s philanthropy world, where such tech and finance titans as Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and Warren Buffett set the tone. (The full list is here.)

            The ranking’s newcomers include:

            — Edward Avedisian, a retired Boston Pops clarinetist who amassed a fortune trading stocks on the side. Avedisian gave $100 million to Boston University before his death in December.

            — David Frederick and his wife, Sophia Lynn, who made gifts totaling $40 million to the University of Pittsburgh and Oxford University in England. Frederick is an appellate attorney who’s argued dozens of cases before the Supreme Court.

            — Sisters Mary Bastian and Emily Markham, the last members of a multigenerational Utah farming and ranching family, who donated 100 acres of land worth $41.3 million to Utah State University.

            — Gordon and Joyce Davis, who gave $44 million to Texas Tech, where Gordon — who holds a doctorate in meat science — once taught and coached the university’s meat-judging team to a national championship.

            The ranking’s changing composition reflects in part the country’s skyrocketing wealth. More than 141,000 Americans have a net worth of $50 million or higher — nearly four times more than just a decade ago, according to the finance company Credit Suisse. Growth accelerated during the pandemic, with the number climbing 75% in just two years.

            The rise of the super wealthy coincides with and fuels another trend: greater fundraising sophistication and the ambition to snare big gifts. Top-tier, high-profile institutions such as Boston University, the Obama Foundation, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art received individual donations of at least $10 million from Philanthropy 50 donors in 2022. But so did the Air Force Academy; McPherson, a small liberal-arts college in Kansas; and Samford, a Christian university in Alabama.

            Altogether, half of the Philanthropy 50 made contributions to organizations that reported the donation as the largest in their history. Also, while big philanthropy is often criticized as being too focused on the coasts and urban areas, half of the 34 gifts to U.S. higher education went to institutions in the country’s interior, some to land-grant universities such as Oregon State, Purdue, and Utah State. The University of Pennsylvania was the lone Ivy League recipient.

            The donors at the ranking’s pinnacle are fixtures in philanthropy. Gates tops the list in his 13th Philanthropy 50 appearance; the Microsoft mogul gave away $5.1 billion in 2022, more than a third of the $14 billion donated by the Philanthropy 50 collectively. The bulk of his gift was a transfer of stock to the foundation he runs with his former wife, Melinda French Gates. Michael Bloomberg — founder of the Bloomberg financial-news empire, a former mayor of New York, and an 18-time veteran of the ranking — finished second; he gave away $1.7 billion to causes that include the arts, education, environment, public health, and programs aimed at improving city governments globally.

            As in years past, men dominate the list of the biggest donors. There’s also only one person of color: Taiwanese American Jen-Hsun Huang, who debuted on the list with his wife, Lori, in a tie for No. 40.

            (Novelist and high-profile philanthropist MacKenzie Scott is not in the ranking, though she has donated some $14 billion to charities since 2020. It’s likely that Scott made gifts to her donor-advised funds that would have earned her a spot in the ranking, but she and her representatives declined to provide information to the Chronicle. French Gates, another big-name donor, also did not share such information.)

            Despite the new blood in the top tier of philanthropists, last year’s biggest donors hewed closely to decades-old conventions of charitable giving. At least 14 earmarked contributions to scholarships for high-school or college students — a type of gift that dates back at least 1,000 years.

            Ten made donations of at least $10 million to support research on cancer, Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and other diseases that have stymied medicine — and attracted philanthropists hunting answers — for decades.

            Some philanthropy observers see in these gifts a focus on the future born of the suddenness with which the pandemic and racial reckoning turned society upside down. “We had to throw away our strategic plan because none of it works anymore,” says Trista Harris, a former foundation leader who now runs FutureGood, a consultancy. Donors recognized “that there might be even bigger change around the corner, and it’s my responsibility to understand what those possibilities are.”

            Others worry that the donors are not addressing the country’s biggest problems. Contributions by last year’s 50 biggest donors toward climate change mitigation and solutions, for instance, reached only $195 million — one-tenth of the more than $2 billion directed to scholarships and disease prevention. Only a handful of gifts aimed to close racial disparities.

            “The default setting for the biggest donors still seems to be to steer away from addressing some of the thorniest societal challenges related, for example, to inequity, racism, and the future of our planet,” says Phil Buchanan, president of the Center for Effective Philanthropy.

            After the police murder of George Floyd in 2020 and resulting nationwide protests, a number of major philanthropists stepped forward to learn about racial justice and understand what they could do, says Crystal Hayling, executive director of the Libra Foundation, which is leading a $45 million effort to support small, Black-led racial justice organizations.

            Now, Hayling says, there’s a reversion to the mean. “Conversation is moving back to a place that’s a little bit more comfortable for people of wealth. They say, ‘Let’s just talk about equal opportunity, job pipelines, and improving schools.’ Those things are important, but they can be slightly evasive of really addressing the issue of racial justice.”

For all of AP’s philanthropy coverage, visit https://apnews.com/hub/philanthropy.As the ranks of America’s super wealthy grow, the roster of major philanthropists is expanding to include not-so-typical megadonors — among them, a professional clarinetist, a Ph.D. in meat science, and a lawyer who regularly argues before the U.S. Supreme Court.That’s according to a Chronicle of Philanthropy analysis of giving by the country’s 50 biggest donors in 2022. Twenty-six of the 50 are new to the Chronicle’s annual ranking, which dates to 2000. They include big names from business such as Airbnb’s Brian Chesky (who gave $100 million to the Obama Foundation), FedEx’s Fred Smith ($65 million to the Marine Corps Scholarship Foundation), and Roku founder Anthony Wood ($71.5 million to several charitable giving vehicles).Also, Jacklyn Bezos, mother of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, made her debut on the list with her husband, Miguel. The two gave $710.5 million to the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center.Other Philanthropy 50 first-timers, however, lack the national profile, the Silicon Valley address, or Wall Street credentials that are commonplace in today’s philanthropy world, where such tech and finance titans as Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and Warren Buffett set the tone. (The full list is here.)The ranking’s newcomers include:— Edward Avedisian, a retired Boston Pops clarinetist who amassed a fortune trading stocks on the side. Avedisian gave $100 million to Boston University before his death in December.— David Frederick and his wife, Sophia Lynn, who made gifts totaling $40 million to the University of Pittsburgh and Oxford University in England.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810301,Ohio proposal: Get parents' OK for kids to use social media,"COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Ohio's governor wants the state to require parental consent for kids under 16 to get new accounts on TikTok, Snapchat and other social media platforms.

            Republican Gov. Mike DeWine's two-year budget proposal would create a law that social media companies must obtain a parent's permission for children to sign up for social media and gaming apps. The proposal also names YouTube, Facebook and Instagram, but the proposal would apply broadly, to “any online web site, online service, online product, or online feature that requires consumer consent to register, sign up, or otherwise create a unique username."" 

            Lt. Gov. Jon Husted, who is driving the initiative, said it would not apply to “e-commerce” or “online shopping.”











            “Social media companies produce a product that is intentionally addictive to our children and has been proven harmful to kids,” Husted said. “Parents should know about it before it happens and social media companies should be held accountable.”

            Companies subject to the regulations would have to produce methods to determine if a user is under 16 and send written confirmation to parents to verify their consent is legitimate. If parents do not sign off on the companies' terms of service, their children couldn't use the platforms. The restrictions would apply only to new account creation.

            Social media companies also would have to create an introductory screen known as a “splash page” for age verification. If the user indicates they're under 16, a parent could verify consent by signing a digital form, providing government identification, connecting with “trained personnel” over video chat, using a credit or debit card or other online payment system, or calling a toll-free number. 

            A similar bill has received bipartisan support in the Democratic-majority Connecticut Legislature but hasn't yet gone to a vote.COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Ohio's governor wants the state to require parental consent for kids under 16 to get new accounts on TikTok, Snapchat and other social media platforms.Republican Gov.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810305,"Hope, robots and Billy Crudup power series 'Hello Tomorrow!'","NEW YORK (AP) — Blink and you might miss it, but a man wearing a business suit and a jetpack casually blasts off in the first episode of the new series “Hello Tomorrow!” 

            He waves to his wife outside his suburban home and soars into the sky. Below him is a fascinating mix of '50s-era cars with tail fins that hover over the ground and robots that do everything from walk the dog to deliver mail. 

            If seems like the utopia we always dreamed about until we see a driverless truck accidentally smash into a homeowner. Not all is perfect in this futuristic world — and the creators want it that way, studded with misery and human quirks.











            “Utopias terrify us,” said Lucas Jansen, who co-created the show with Amit Bhalla. “The 'bots can do a lot for you, but they can’t relieve you of your human burden. And we’re ever so grateful and would hope that that continues to be the case as our society progresses.”

            The Apple TV+ series taps into the alternate-reality, retro-cool of the ’50s that's so popular right now — see the film “Don’t Worry Darling” and the streaming series “For All Mankind” — as it explores the American dream.

            At its heart is Jack, a traveling salesman played by Billy Crudup who sells condos on the moon — sorry, “lunar residencies” — to those disappointed with life on Earth. “We’re not just selling. We’re changing lives,” he tells his selling team.

            It's a scam, of course, one that only he knows is happening and it requires him and his hoodwinked team to occasionally hit the road before suckers wise up and want their money back. 

            The series explores the American fantasy that there’s something on the horizon — a medicine, a new product, a lottery win, any kind of Hail Mary — that will make our lives full. “We imagine that has a lot to do with the American experience right now,” said Bhalla. 

            While some viewers may see Crudup’s character as a con man like Bernie Madoff or a character straight out of “The Music Man,” the actor himself sees him more like a preacher, painting a better future for his flock.

            “In Jack’s mind, providing that hope is proselytizing. That is the good word,” he said. “The good word is the future because the present is so mundane, it’s so boring. It doesn’t have any of the American promise. It just has the reality of living.”

            Bhalla and Jansen dreamed up a carefully curated world for this morality tale, one that can be called “retro-future” or an “an atomic age vision of the future.” It pulls from a familiar collective consciousness — old-school diners, fedoras, leafy suburbs, apple-cheeked boys and girls — and adds tons of cheery robots. Enough is the same — like that customer service is still terrible — and enough is different — baseball involves something called “home zone” — to keep you off-balance.

            The music team was tapped to find songs that were nostalgic but yet unfamiliar. So they used deep cuts of Louis Prima or The Dreamliners instead of their hits. Composer Mark Mothersbaugh, formerly of the band Devo, dug out his collection of vintage synthesizers and instruments to re-create period sounds.

            It took some time for all parts of the creative team to find the right gear. At first, the designers proposed sleek, scary robots, but Bhalla and Jansen told them they wanted something more warm and rusted. 

            “We wanted the technology to feel lived in. To feel like our phones do — scratched and cracked and whatever. They’re not what comes out of the advertisement,” said Bhalla. 

            Bhalla and Jansen cut their teeth in TV under David Milch, the visionary creator of such shows as “Hill Street Blues,” ""NYPD Blue"" and “Deadwood.” They met while writing for Milch's show “Luck” and teamed up again for “Bloodline.” 

            The new series was inspired in part by the training videos made for car salesmen in the ’50s that Bhalla and Jansen — together with producer Ryan Kalil — became fascinated by. “They were like these holy texts of capitalism,” said Jansen.

            They soon became interested in the idea of a salesman who begins to believe his own pitch. ""This could be a very powerful, very engaging and charismatic salesman who also lived sort of poised over a chasm of crazy, disastrous possibilities,” said Jansen. 

            Life for Crudup’s salesman gets more complicated when he is forced to confront the reality of his duplicity and the wreckage he's made of his life. Years of traveling has left him alone and estranged from his family. 

            “What you see is this guy being ripped apart,” said Crudup. “It’s a great contrast for somebody who has to live with the things that they’ve done while still trying to maintain the optimism that is at their core.” 

            The cast also includes Hank Azaria, Haneefah Wood, Jacki Weaver, Alison Pill, Dewshane Williams, Matthew Maher and Nicholas Podany. 

            Crudup gives one of his career-best performances as a man barely keeping it together, with just a big smile and some slogans covering his hurt. “The experience was everything I had hoped acting might ever be,” he said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810306,Top goal scorer Driussi signs new deal with Austin FC,"AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Austin FC signed forward Sebastian Driussi, one of the top goal scorers in Major League Soccer, to a new contract that keeps him with the club through the 2025 season with an option for 2026, the team announced Tuesday.

            The 27-year-old Argentinian ranked second in MLS with 22 goals in 2022 as Austin advanced to the Western Conference final in just its second season. He scored three goals in the playoffs and finished second in voting for the league's most valuable player award.

            “This club and community have made Austin feel like home for my family and me,"" Driussi said in a statement. “I have big ambitions here both personally and for the team.”











            Driussi already was one of the club's designated player signings and has 30 total goals and 12 assists since joining the team in August 2021.

            Financial terms of the deal were not released, but the Driussi contract is the club's biggest move since former Sporting Director Claudio Reyna moved into a technical adviser role. That left coach Josh Wolff and interim Sporting Director Sean Rubio, the team's director of player personnel, to manage the roster.

            “Sebastian is one of the most gifted and talented players in Major League Soccer,” Wolff said. “He’s a top-quality player and leader in our locker room. This contract extension is well-deserved, and we’re thrilled that he’s decided to make Austin his home for the foreseeable future.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810307,"Q&A: Craig Newmark focuses gifts on journalism, cyberdefense","NEW YORK (AP) — Craig Newmark talks about getting focused, even as he is momentarily distracted by his beloved birds flying away from the numerous feeders in his courtyard to go visit some of his Manhattan neighbors.

            “I’m trying to be a bit more focused, because a lot of what I do has to do with defending the country,” said Newmark, best known as the founder of Craigslist, though, since 2016, his philanthropic work has stretched his influence well beyond expanding the world of classified ads onto the internet with his pioneering website.

            “Better journalism is part of that,” he continued. “I learned in high school history that a trustworthy press is the immune system of democracy. Supporting vets and active service members and their families -- that protects the country. Cybersecurity protects the country and is actually something I know a little bit about.”











            Newmark donated $81 million to those causes through the Craig Newmark Foundation and Craig Newmark Philanthropic Fund in 2022, returning him to The Chronicle of Philanthropy’s list of biggest donors, The Philanthropy 50, released Tuesday.

            “The only exception,” Newmark, 70, says with a nod to a painting of his beloved pigeon Ghostface Killah on his mantle, “is pigeon rescue. But again, I love birds, have a sense of humor, and I suspect that pigeons may become our replacement species.”

            The Associated Press spoke with Newmark last week about what inspires his philanthropy and why he feels the need to give so urgently. The interview was edited for clarity and length.

            ____

            Q: Does it mean something to you to be on The Philanthropy 50, to be one of the 50 biggest donors in the country?

            A: It’s nice to be noticed and then it’s back to work. I’m pretty much a one-man shop. I coordinate a bunch of people helping me out so there’s always more to do.

            Q: Can you talk about your donations from last year?

            A: A lot of it was me stepping up in cybersecurity. Our nation is under threat from people who wish us harm. They’re attacking our systems. And it’s incumbent upon everyone, if they can, to play a role and fight back.

            ____

            Q: You do a lot of your fighting back through the City University of New York, especially the journalism school.

            A: CUNY, in general, I like a lot because it helped a lot of New Yorkers to get from lives with no money into the middle class and even better. That matters a lot. America, in a lot of ways, is about a strong middle class. The journalism school is about getting people of all sorts to represent what they’re about, to be fair in the news. The news needs to talk about everyone and usually it’s done best by people who represent one group or another. This is my clumsy way of saying it should be about fairness.

            ____

            Q: Is that why you made a major donation to CUNY’s Center for Community Media, which includes the Black Media Initiative that supports outlets serving minorities?

            A: I see need. And my contributions are money, influence and, perhaps the most difficult of contributions, getting out of people’s way. Very often, I don’t know what I’m doing, but I do know that it’s really important to get out of the way.

            ____

            Q: Why is it so important to you to support veterans and their families?

            A: Fifteen years ago, I’m at a lunch sitting next to a volunteer from the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America. He talks a little bit about it and suddenly it all clicks in: There are people giving up our great deal to protect me and my family -- going overseas, maybe risk taking a bullet -- to protect me, so I should give back. And so I started doing so, focusing at first with Iraq and Afghanistan veterans and then doing more in specific areas.

            ____

            Q: In what way?

            A: For example, in tech, I’m supporting programs which train vets and military spouses in cybersecurity. I’m just going to keep pushing in that area. But only as long as I live. After that, it’s over.

            ____

            Q: You don’t expect Craig Newmark Philanthropies to continue after your death?

            A: If you saw the latest Bob Woodruff Foundation fundraiser, they introduced their Hologram Craig and I’m currently in the process of uploading into that. But that’s mostly a joke. The need is enormous in the here and now, so I plan to spend everything during my lifetime and get a lot of good things in motion because I think our species and our civilization need to get through the next 20 years or so in good shape. So that’s where I’m spending my energies.

            ____

            Q: In 2022, there was high inflation and recession worries, which caused some people to curb their giving. You were not one of those people. How come?

            A: Because the country and the planet needs it. I’m focusing on areas where I see a great need. This is an “all hands on deck” situation. It is like World War II where everyone was expected to play a role. That’s what I will do… Any success I’ve had in my life has been by accidentally being in the right time and place. That makes me the Forrest Gump of the internet.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810309,"Latest downed objects could well be 'benign,' US says","WASHINGTON (AP) — The three still-unidentified aerial objects shot down by the U.S. in the past week likely had merely a ""benign purpose,” the White House acknowledged Tuesday, drawing a distinction between them and the massive Chinese balloon that earlier traversed the U.S. with a suspected goal of surveillance.

            “The intelligence community is considering as a leading explanation that these could just be balloons tied to some commercial or benign purpose,” said White House national security spokesman John Kirby.

            Officials also disclosed that a missile fired at one of the three objects, over Lake Huron on Sunday, missed its intended target and landed in the water before a second one successfully hit.











            The new details came as the Biden’s administration’s actions over the past two weeks faced fresh scrutiny in Congress.

            First, U.S. fighter jets didn't shoot down what officials described as a Chinese spy balloon until after had crossed much of the United States, citing safety concerns. Then the military deployed F-22 fighters with heat-seeking missiles to quickly shoot down what likely were harmless objects.

            Taken together, the actions raised political as well as security questions, about whether the Biden administration overreacted after facing Republican criticism for reacting too slowly to the big balloon. 

            Even as more information about the three objects emerges, questions remain about what they were, who sent them and how the U.S. might respond to unidentified airborne objects in the future. 

            Still unaddressed are questions about the original balloon, including what spying capabilities it had and whether it was transmitting signals as it flew over sensitive military sites in the United States. It was believed by American intelligence to have initially been on a track toward the U.S. territory of Guam, according to a U.S. official.

            The U.S. tracked it for several days after it left China, said the official, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence. It appears to have been blown off its initial trajectory and ultimately flew over the continental U.S., the official said.

            Balloons and other unidentified objects have been previously spotted over Guam, a strategic hub for the U.S. Navy and Air Force in the western Pacific.

            It’s unclear how much control China retained over the balloon once it veered from its original trajectory. A second U.S. official said the balloon could have been externally maneuvered or directed to loiter over a specific target, but it’s unclear whether Chinese forces did so.

            Even less is known about the three objects shot down over three successive days, from Friday to Sunday, in part because it's been challenging to recover debris from remote locations in the Canadian Yukon, off northern Alaska and near the Upper Peninsula of Michigan on Lake Huron. So far, officials have no indication they were part of a bigger surveillance operation along with the balloon that that was shot down off the South Carolina coast on Feb. 4.

            “We don’t see anything that points right now to being part of the PRC spy balloon program,” Kirby told reporters, referring to the People's Republic of China. It’s also not likely the objects were “intelligence collection against the United States of any kind — that’s the indication now.”

            No country or private company has come forward to claim any of the objects, Kirby said. They do not appear to have been operated by the U.S. government.

            Kirby had hinted Monday that the three objects were different in substantive ways from the balloon, including in their size. And his comments Tuesday marked a clear effort by the White House to draw a line between the balloon, which officials believe was part of a Chinese military program that has operated over five continents, and objects that the administration thinks could simply be part of some research or commercial effort.

            In Washington, Pentagon officials met with senators for a classified briefing on the shootdowns. Lawmakers conveyed concerns from their constituents about a need to keep them informed and came away assured the objects were not extraterrestrial in nature but wanting many more details.

            Still, Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., said the successful recent interceptions were likely to have a “calming influence” and make future shootdowns less likely. 

            Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told reporters after the briefing that he didn’t think the objects posed a threat.

            “They’re trying to figure out — you know there’s a bunch of junk up there. So you got to figure out what’s the threat, what’s not. You see something, you shouldn’t always have to shoot it down,"" Graham said. 

            Biden has ordered National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan to form an interagency team to study the detection, analysis and “disposition of unidentified aerial objects” that could pose either safety or security risks.

            The recent objects have also drawn the attention of world leaders including in Canada, where one was shot down on Saturday, and in the United Kingdom, where the prime minister has ordered a security review.

            Japan’s Defense Ministry said Tuesday that at least three flying objects spotted in Japanese airspace since 2019 are strongly believed to have been Chinese spy balloons.

            Meanwhile, U.S. officials confirmed that a first missile aimed at the object over Lake Huron landed instead in the water, but that a second one hit the target.

            Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the military went to “great lengths” to make sure none of the strikes put civilians at risk, including identifying what the debris field size was likely to be and the maximum effective range of the missiles used. 

            “We’re very, very careful to make sure that those shots are in fact safe,” Milley said. “And that’s the guidance from the president. Shoot it down, but make sure we minimize collateral damage and we preserve the safety of the American people.""

            The object taken down Sunday was the third in as many days to be shot from the skies. The White House has said the objects differed in size and maneuverability from the Chinese surveillance balloon that U.S. fighter jets shot down earlier this month, but that their altitude was low enough to pose a risk to civilian air traffic.

            Weather challenges and the remote locations of where the three objects were shot down over Alaska, Canada and Lake Huron have impeded recovery efforts so far.

            Milley was in Brussels with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to meet with members of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group on additional weapons and defense needs for Kyiv in advance of Russia's anticipated spring offensive.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810310,N Ireland politics stay stuck as organ-donor law bid fails,"LONDON (AP) — Northern Ireland’s main British unionist party scuttled an attempt to restore the collapsed Belfast-based Assembly on Tuesday, refusing to budge on a Brexit-related boycott that has kept the legislature on ice for a year.

            Politicians remain deadlocked despite signs of progress in talks between the U.K. and the European Union on ending the post-Brexit trade dispute behind Northern Ireland’s political crisis.

            Lawmakers were called to the Stormont assembly building in an attempt to pass a new organ-donation law. The bid failed when the Democratic Unionist Party used its veto to block the election of a speaker — a prerequisite for any business to be done.











            Under Northern Ireland’s political system, power is shared between Irish nationalists and British unionists, and neither side can govern without the other.

            The DUP veto scuttled an attempt to pass “Daithi’s Law,” which would replace an opt-in organ donation system with one that presumes most adults to be potential donors unless they opt out. The bill is named for Daithi MacGabhann, a 6-year-old boy awaiting a heart transplant.

            DUP legislator Paul Givan said his party supported the opt-out organ law but would not budge on its boycott. He said the U.K. government in London could step in and pass the necessary regulations while the assembly was suspended.

            Daithi’s father, Mairtin MacGabhann, said it was “a very disappointing day.”

            Northern Ireland is the only part of the U.K. that shares a border with an EU member nation, Ireland. When the U.K. left the bloc in 2020, the British government and the EU agreed to keep the Irish border free of customs posts and other checks to preserve the open border that is a key pillar of Northern Ireland's peace process.

            Instead, there are checks on some goods entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the U.K. Unionist politicians say the new trade border undermines Northern Ireland’s place in the United Kingdom. They are refusing to return to government until the trade barriers are removed.

            The political impasse has left Northern Ireland's 1.8 million people with no functioning government and facing a new election that almost no one wants. Last week the U.K. government extended the deadline for forming a new government by a year in an attempt to buy breathing time to find a solution.

            The U.K. government hopes to resolve the EU trade dispute and break the political impasse before the 25th anniversary in April of Northern Ireland’s 1998 Good Friday peace accord. It is pinning its hopes on striking a deal with the EU that would ease the checks and coax unionists back into the government.

            Achieving that long looked unlikely, as Britain threatened to unilaterally rip up parts of the Brexit agreement, and the EU accused the U.K. of failing to honor the legally binding treaty.

            But the mood has improved since Prime Minister Rishi Sunak took office in late October, and the two sides have held constructive talks. However, any compromise by Sunak will be a hard sell to the DUP and is sure to anger staunch Brexiteers who form a powerful faction inside the governing Conservative Party.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810312,Alex Ovechkin away from Capitals to attend to family matter,"ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) — Alex Ovechkin will be away from the Washington Capitals to attend to a family matter and the health of a loved one and is expected to be gone for at least the rest of the week, if not longer.

            General manager Brian MacLellan announced Ovechkin's absence before the team's morning skate Tuesday. No further details were released, though it appears Washington is preparing to be without its longtime captain and face of the franchise for an extended period.

            Coach Peter Laviolette said he doesn't envision Ovechkin will be back “in the foreseeable future.”











            “When it comes to your family and parents, that’s what matters,” Laviolette said. ""He’s going to deal with some things right now and we’re going to be supportive.""

            Further complicating matters if Ovechkin needs to go home to Russia, where his parents and other family members live, are travel restrictions in place amid the country's war in Ukraine. There are no direct flights between North America and Moscow.

            The Capitals play two home games this week before facing the Carolina Hurricanes in the NHL’s Stadium Series outdoors in Raleigh on Saturday night.

            “Sending positive thoughts on behalf of the organization,” the Hurricanes posted on Twitter before the team played at the Capitals on Tuesday night. “There is nothing more important than those we love. We are wishing the best for Alex and his family.”

            Ovechkin, 37, leads Washington with 32 goals and 54 points. He has missed only 48 games throughout his 18-year NHL career, and the Capitals have lost 25 of them.

            “We’ve been playing without key guys all season and last year and the year before. We’re going to miss him,” center Lars Eller said. “We’re a better team when he’s in our lineup, but other guys will have to fill the gap in the meantime and we can do that.”

            The Capitals have been playing without top defenseman John Carlson since he took a puck to the head on Dec. 23. Also missing are first-line right winger Tom Wilson, fourth-line center Nic Dowd and now Ovechkin, so the team recalled winger Joe Snively from Hershey of the American Hockey League.

            In all aspects of the game, Washington looks different without Ovechkin, who is the league's career leader in power-play goals thanks to his signature spot in the left faceoff circle.

            “Obviously teams are used to seeing (Ovechkin in) his office, so we all know what he’s capable of there, how he can score from there,” longtime teammate Nicklas Backstrom said. ""Definitely going to miss him, but at the same time we have to find other ways to create chances and try to capitalize there.”

            The Capitals enter an important stretch in a precarious position: holding on to one of two wild-card spots in the Eastern Conference and in danger of falling out of playoff position by the end of the week. Even before Ovechkin's absence, they have averaged 2.27 goals over their past 14 games.

            “You've got to score goals to win games,” Backstrom said. “You’re not going to win games with just one goal. I think we got to be a little more urgent out there we got to be a little more hungrier around the net.”

            Ovechkin met with teammates Tuesday before leaving the Capitals' practice facility. That gave players a chance to offer their support before preparing to take the ice without him.

            “It’s nice to get to see him and give him a hug and let him know that we’re here for him in person rather than over text,” winger T.J. Oshie said. “We’re thinking about him and we’re missing him and wishing him all the best.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810313,IRS nominee faces herculean challenge of modernizing agency,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Even in the best of times, the IRS is the agency Americans love to hate. And these are hardly the best of times. 

            The nation’s tax-collecting agency is a villain to many a taxpayer. It’s a magnet for GOP criticism. It's woefully understaffed, and the new Republican House would like to claw back a big infusion of money meant to help fix things.

            So why would a business consultant who earned a $6.6 million paycheck last year possibly want to take charge? It turns out Danny Werfel has a serial relationship with the federal bureaucracy.











            The 51-year-old, whose Senate confirmation hearing is set for Wednesday, has already held multiple thankless jobs in government, in both Republican and Democratic administrations. 

            He led the cross-government effort under President Barack Obama to dole out $700 billion in stimulus money following the economic meltdown of 2008. He played a key role in the George W. Bush administration's effort to purchase toxic assets from banks as the subprime mortgage crisis grew. 

            And he was temporarily put in charge of the IRS in 2013 to clean up a controversy involving allegations that the agency improperly targeted certain groups applying for tax-exempt status. 

            Werfel even hosts a podcast called “Gov Actually,” a play on the rom-com “Love Actually.” 

            IRS commissioner is historically a hard post to fill, in part because of the skill set needed to head an agency of roughly 80,000 employees responsible for collecting the revenue that funds the federal government. Werfel would replace Charles Rettig, who was appointed by President Donald Trump. An acting commissioner has been filling the job since Rettig’s five-year term ended in November. 

            Dan Tangherlini, a former senior official at the Treasury Department and now podcast co-host, says Werfel's experience with past IRS controversies will be an asset as the agency faces continual threats.

            “He’s seen divided government and deeply divisive views, and has been able to successfully navigate through them,” Tangherlini said. “He understands the challenge it faces and saw that the first time around. If he would’ve had enough then, he wouldn’t be up for the job now.”

            Ahead of the hearing, GOP criticism seems more directed at Biden administration plans to bolster funding for the agency than at Werfel himself. 

            “Under Democrat administrations, the IRS has become a partisan weapon used to target conservatives and treat law abiding business owners like criminals,"" Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said in a statement. ""The Democrats want to use the IRS to go after hardworking Americans who just want to earn a living and put food on their tables.”

            In 2013, as acting director of the IRS, Werfel told members of Congress that taxpayers had lost faith in the agency and pledged that he was “committed to restoring that trust.” A decade later, he's positioned to take another run at fulfilling that pledge.

            When President Joe Biden nominated Werfel, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen praised his “deep commitment to fairness” and said his background made him “uniquely qualified to lead the agency at this critical juncture.”

            Max Stier, founding president and CEO of the Partnership for Public Service, said Werfel’s work outside government is a big asset. 

            ″He’s seen not only in our country but around the world, the attempts to reform public sector entities,"" Stier said. ""He’s going to come to the table with experience and a knowledge base that makes him the best choice.” 

            Werfel, who lives in Washington with his wife and two children, has a law degree from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and a master's degree in public policy from Duke. He declined to comment for this story.

            He's spent the last nine years at Boston Consulting Group, where he helped launch its U.S. public sector practice, working on organizational change, risk management, IT modernization and business process improvements both in the U.S. and internationally, according to the group's website. 

            Last year alone he took in $6.6 million, according to a financial disclosure document he submitted to Treasury in November. At the IRS, the top salary is roughly $255,000.

            If confirmed, Werfel will manage the $80 billion infusion of funds to the IRS approved in the Democrats’ flagship climate and healthcare law. Roughly $46 billion was allocated for enforcing tax laws and the remainder will go toward taxpayer services, operations support and updating business systems.

            He'll have to modernize, boost morale and improve hiring, among other major tasks. 

            Tony Reardon, president of the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents IRS workers, said he has already spoken with Werfel about a need to retain current employees, improve hiring and maintain open lines of communication between management and the union.

            “It is my hope,” Reardon said, that “the next commissioner will be focused on investing in the workforce and rebuilding the agency in a way that ensures the tax code is enforced fully and fairly and Americans can get their tax questions answered in a timely manner.”

            House Republicans' first move as a majority was to vote to take back nearly 90% of the new funding. Republicans have suggested without evidence that the agency would use the new money to hire an army of tax agents with weapons. 

            “The last thing (Americans) need is more IRS agents knocking on doors to conduct audits, yet this IRS funding is part of the broad Biden administration strategy to tax, audit exponentially more Americans,” Rep. Adrian Smith, R-Neb., said in his speech introducing the bill.

            The measure is likely to die in the Democrat-led Senate, and Biden has said he’d veto it if it reached his desk. 

            Werfel is used to political controversy. In 2013, he was named the acting head of the agency, tasked with cleanup of a controversy under the Obama administration when the IRS was found to have used inappropriate criteria to review tea party groups and other organizations applying for tax-exempt status. A subsequent report found that both conservative and liberal groups were scrutinized. 

            Nina Olson, a former head of the Office of the Taxpayer Advocate, said that when Werfel came into the IRS in the summer of 2013, ”he walked into a hornet's nest.”

            “He was under fire even though he had nothing to do with the controversy and he handled the barrage of questions extraordinarily well,” Olson said. 

            In the Bush administration, Werfel oversaw the efforts of the Office of Financial Stability to achieve a clean financial statement audit in its first year of existence, a key role in the efforts to ease the subprime mortgage crisis. He was later named Obama's Office of Management and Budget controller, tasked with implementing the $787 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.WASHINGTON (AP) — Even in the best of times, the IRS is the agency Americans love to hate. And these are hardly the best of times.The nation’s tax-collecting agency is a villain to many a taxpayer. It’s a magnet for GOP criticism. It's woefully understaffed, and the new Republican House would like to claw back a big infusion of money meant to help fix things.So why would a business consultant who earned a $6.6 million paycheck last year possibly want to take charge? It turns out Danny Werfel has a serial relationship with the federal bureaucracy.The 51-year-old, whose Senate confirmation hearing is set for Wednesday, has already held multiple thankless jobs in government, in both Republican and Democratic administrations.He led the cross-government effort under President Barack Obama to dole out $700 billion in stimulus money following the economic meltdown of 2008. He played a key role in the George W. Bush administration's effort to purchase toxic assets from banks as the subprime mortgage crisis grew.And he was temporarily put in charge of the IRS in 2013 to clean up a controversy involving allegations that the agency improperly targeted certain groups applying for tax-exempt status.Werfel even hosts a podcast called “Gov Actually,” a play on the rom-com “Love Actually.”IRS commissioner is historically a hard post to fill, in part because of the skill set needed to head an agency of roughly 80,000 employees responsible for collecting the revenue that funds the federal government. Werfel would replace Charles Rettig, who was appointed by President Donald Trump. An acting commissioner has been filling the job since Rettig’s five-year term ended in November.Dan Tangherlini, a former senior official at the Treasury Department and now podcast co-host, says Werfel's experience with past IRS controversies will be an asset as the agency faces continual threats.“He’s seen divided government and deeply divisive views, and has been able to successfully navigate through them,” Tangherlini said. “He understands the challenge it faces and saw that the first time around. If he would’ve had enough then, he wouldn’t be up for the job now.”Ahead of the hearing, GOP criticism seems more directed at Biden administration plans to bolster funding for the agency than at Werfel himself.“Under Democrat administrations, the IRS has become a partisan weapon used to target conservatives and treat law abiding business owners like criminals,"" Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said in a statement. ""The Democrats want to use the IRS to go after hardworking Americans who just want to earn a living and put food on their tables.”In 2013, as acting director of the IRS, Werfel told members of Congress that taxpayers had lost faith in the agency and pledged that he was “committed to restoring that trust.” A decade later, he's positioned to take another run at fulfilling that pledge.When President Joe Biden nominated Werfel, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen praised his “deep commitment to fairness” and said his background made him “uniquely qualified to lead the agency at this critical juncture.”Max Stier, founding president and CEO of the Partnership for Public Service, said Werfel’s work outside government is a big asset.″He’s seen not only in our country but around the world, the attempts to reform public sector entities,"" Stier said. ""He’s going to come to the table with experience and a knowledge base that makes him the best choice.”Werfel, who lives in Washington with his wife and two children, has a law degree from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and a master's degree in public policy from Duke. He declined to comment for this story.He's spent the last nine years at Boston Consulting Group, where he helped launch its U.S. public sector practice, working on organizational change, risk management, IT modernization and business process improvements both in the U.S. and internationally, according to the group's website.Last year alone he took in $6.6 million, according to a financial disclosure document he submitted to Treasury in November. At the IRS, the top salary is roughly $255,000.If confirmed, Werfel will manage the $80 billion infusion of funds to the IRS approved in the Democrats’ flagship climate and healthcare law. Roughly $46 billion was allocated for enforcing tax laws and the remainder will go toward taxpayer services, operations support and updating business systems.He'll have to modernize, boost morale and improve hiring, among other major tasks.Tony Reardon, president of the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents IRS workers, said he has already spoken with Werfel about a need to retain current employees, improve hiring and maintain open lines of communication between management and the union.“It is my hope,” Reardon said, that “the next commissioner will be focused on investing in the workforce and rebuilding the agency in a way that ensures the tax code is enforced fully and fairly and Americans can get their tax questions answered in a timely manner.”House Republicans' first move as a majority was to vote to take back nearly 90% of the new funding.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810330,"At least 32 civilians killed in eastern Congo, says the U.N.","DAKAR, Senegal (AP) — At least 32 civilians have been killed by rebel groups in eastern Congo's Ituri province, said a spokesman for the United Nations.

            Twenty people were killed by the militia group CODECO and a dozen were killed by the Allied Democratic Forces, which is allied to the Islamic State group, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said in a press conference on Monday. 

            Calling the situation “confusing,” Dujarric said it is hard for the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Congo to get more information due to restricted movement in the area.











            Fighting between CODECO, a loose association of various ethnic Lendu militia groups, and Zaire, a mainly ethnic Hema self-defense group, has been ongoing since 2017 but has worsened recently. At least 32 civilians were killed by CODECO last month, say local officials. In December, the United Nations said the insurgent group was expanding its areas of control, attacking civilians and Congo's military, and taxing communities in the areas that it holds.

            The killings come amid surging violence across eastern Congo, where conflict has been simmering for decades as more than 120 armed groups are fighting in the region, most for land and control of mines with valuable minerals, while some groups are trying to protect their communities.

            In neighboring North Kivu province, the situation is deteriorating as the M23 rebel group, which was dormant for nearly a decade and resurfaced at the end of 2021, continues to seize swaths of territory and killing civilians. 

            The M23 first rose to prominence 10 years ago when its fighters seized Goma, the largest city in Congo’s east, which sits on the border with Rwanda. The group derives its name from a peace agreement signed on March 23, 2009 which called for the rebels to be integrated into the Congo army. The M23 accuse the government of not implementing the accord. The group is believed to have backing from Rwanda, findings supported by the U.N. 

            A peace agreement last year made during a summit in Angola was supposed to see the M23 withdraw from areas it had captured, however that is not being implemented, according to local residents. 

            Last week M23 fighters advanced toward Sake town in the Masisi area, displacing more than 65,000 people, according to an internal report for aid groups seen by The Associated Press. The rebels' advance increases the risk of isolating Goma and cutting off humanitarian access, say aid agencies. 

            The U.N. peacekeeping mission in Congo, known as MONUSCO, has also been attacked amid the volatility. 

            Earlier this month one of the U.N. mission's helicopters came under fire in North Kivu province, killing a South African peacekeeper and injuring another, said the U.N. No one has claimed responsibility for the attack. The United Nations Security Council said the deliberate targeting of peacekeepers could constitute war crimes.

He had spent 846 days in jail.Kappan was arrested in October 2020, when he was on his way to Hathras district in Uttar Pradesh state to report on a gang rape and murder case of a young Dalit woman that sparked protests in India.He had been charged with sedition, money laundering and criminal conspiracy.Kappan was one of the journalists to be detained under sections of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) — a stringent anti-terror law in India.""I found out that I was booked under UAPA only when I read a newspaper in jail. I immediately resigned myself to the fact that I was going to remain in jail for a minimum of five years,"" he told DW.While granting bail to Kappan, the Supreme Court of India noted the length of the reporter's incarceration and pointed out that ""every person has a right to free expression.""UAPA was first introduced in 2008 with the aim of preventing organizations from engaging in unlawful activities.In 2019, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government amended the law, giving law enforcement authorities absolute power to designate individuals as ""terrorists"" even before their crime is proven in court.The stringent nature of the law rests in the fact that — if charged under UAPA — obtaining bail becomes nearly impossible. This makes the process of getting to a trial a punishment in itself.The law has been severely criticized by activists, lawyers, journalists, and even former Supreme Court judges for weakening the fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression.There have been multiple demands from rights groups to amend UAPA.Supreme Court Senior Advocate Rebecca John told DW ""the act is draconian and goes against the spirit of the Indian constitution"" and especially against the essence of journalism which is to ""never be silent.""In 2021, after the arrest of Kashmiri rights activist Khurram Parvez, the UN said that India's usage of anti-terror laws was ""worrying"" and ""hundreds of people remain in detention for exercising their right to the freedom of expression.""Despite much pressure, the Ministry of Home Affairs has made it clear that no amendments to UAPA are being considered.Since 2013, Kappan's coverage focused on the cases, stories and families of those who had been charged under UAPA.Kappan said he was ""not shocked"" to find out that he himself had been charged under this law.""I am a journalist and I am a Muslim. I am the perfect target for UAPA. This law is a political tool,"" he said.However, he added, he was surprised that he was able to walk out on bail ""so soon.""""I cannot believe that despite being charged under UAPA, I managed to secure bail. This was only because of media pressure, advocacy, and yes, I still have faith in our Supreme Court.""The day Kappan left prison he told reporters, ""journalism is in danger in India.""In recent years, several other journalists have been charged under UAPA, including Kashmiri journalists Fahad Shah and Asif Sultan, photojournalist Masrat Zahra and journalist Shyam Meera Singh, among others.In the World Press Freedom Index 2022 compiled by rights organization Reporters Without Borders (RSF), India ranked 150th among 180 countries — the South Asian nation's lowest ranking ever.Indian tax authorities on Tuesday also raided the BBC's offices in New Delhi and Mumbai, weeks after the broadcaster released a documentary critical of Prime Minister Modi.Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) said Indian institutions worked independently and the tax department was ""within the law in looking into tax compliance.""""India is a vibrant democracy where no one is above the law,"" BJP National Spokesman Gopal Krishna Agarwal said.The government has criticized the BBC documentary as an attempt to push a ""discredited narrative"" and slammed the broadcaster as biased, lacking objectivity and showing a ""continuing colonial mindset.""The BBC has stood by its reporting for the documentary.Neha Dixit, a freelance journalist, said in the past journalists were charged with criminal defamation but ""since 2014, the political dispensation has actually started filing law and order-related cases against journalists. Such cases take a lot of time and resources when they go to court.""Dixit also pointed out that when UAPA charges are levelled against journalists, ""it [press freedom] becomes worse, because then the state is setting a precedent for a lot of journalists — that if you continue to do your work, you will be put behind bars and stay there for many years.""In the long run, she explained, use of anti-terror laws like UAPA results in the ""eroding of our democratic structures because if one can't even talk about what is happening on the ground, how do you even fix them [democratic structures]?""New Delhi-based reporter Asmita Nandy said the increased use of anti-terror laws to target the press has created an atmosphere of fear among journalists.Once a reporter is charged with UAPA, she pointed out, ""it doesn't matter if the person is found to be absolutely innocent later, the headlines are made, the damage is done. You will live with the tag of terrorist for the rest of your life.""Abhinandan Sekhri, co-founder of the media outlet Newslaundry, told DW that the increased use of anti-terror laws ""to completely intimidate or spook journalists and the press in general"" has been successful in creating a ""chilling effect.""""In an age where you could be arrested for a tweet or have the most draconian laws activated for benign speeches, it keeps people on edge,"" he said.Edited by: Srinivas Mazumdaru",2023/02/14,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810336,Former Wilmington Trust executive drafts settlement with SEC,"DOVER, Del. (AP) — A former executive of the only financial institution to be criminally charged in connection with the federal bank bailout program in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis has reached a settlement with federal securities regulators in a related civil action.

            In a court filing Tuesday, attorneys for William North and the Securities and Exchange Commission asked a federal judge in Delaware to suspend activity in the SEC's lawsuit against North pending commission authorization of the proposed consent judgment. The commission's review is expected to take six to eight weeks. Details of the proposed settlement were not included in the court filing.

            North is the former chief credit officer for Wilmington Trust. He, along with former bank president Robert Harra, former chief financial officer David Gibson and former controller Kevyn Rakowski, were convicted in 2018 on criminal charges of fraud, conspiracy and making false statements regarding the bank’s troubled commercial loan portfolio.











            The bank itself also was criminally charged but reached a $60 million settlement with prosecutors just as a trial was set to start. 

            The executives received prison sentences ranging from three to six years, but a federal appeals court panel reversed their convictions for making false statements and ordered that judgments of acquittals be entered. The panel also ordered a retrial of the conspiracy and securities fraud charges, but prosecutors later opted to drop the case altogether.

            Meanwhile, the SEC filed a civil lawsuit claiming that the executives knowingly or recklessly made false disclosures regarding the bank’s loan portfolio. 

            Gibson and Rakowski finalized settlements with the SEC in 2019, agreeing to pay more than $70,000 and $44,000, respectively, to the agency. Harra agreed last year to pay a civil penalty of $100,000 to resolve the claims against him.

            An attorney for North deferred comment Tuesday, noting that the commission has not yet approved the settlement.

            In a separate civil action, Wilmington Trust agreed to pay $200 million cash to settle a shareholder lawsuit alleging fraudulent concealment of billions of dollars in bad loans. Auditing firm KPMG agreed to pay an additional $10 million as part of the settlement.

            In the criminal case, prosecutors alleged that the executives misled regulators and investors about Wilmington Trust’s massive amount of past-due commercial real estate loans before the bank was hastily sold in 2011 while bordering on collapse. 

            Founded by members of the DuPont family in 1903, the bank imploded despite receiving $330 million from the federal Troubled Asset Relief Program.

            Prosecutors said bank officials waived millions of dollars in matured loans from reporting requirements if they were designated as “current for interest” and in the process of being extended. To ensure that loans well past their repayment dates were purportedly exempt from reporting requirements, the bank lent even more money to struggling developers just to make the interest payments.

            In the fourth quarter of 2009, bank officials reported only $10.8 million in commercial loans as 90 days or more past due, concealing more than $316 million in past-due loans subject to the waiver practice, according to prosecutors. 

            In one email to Harra, North referred to certain loans as “credit turds.”

            Meanwhile, before its 2011 fire sale to M&T Bank, Wilmington Trust raised $287 million in a 2010 stock offering, intended partly to help repay the TARP funds, while hiding the truth about its shaky financial condition from investors, prosecutors said.

            Defense attorneys argued that the waiver practice had been in place for decades and was no secret. They also maintained that instructions for filing reports with the Federal Reserve and for disclosing financial information in SEC filings were ambiguous, and that the term “past due” was not clearly defined. 

            The appeals court agreed that the reporting requirements were ambiguous.DOVER, Del. (AP) — A former executive of the only financial institution to be criminally charged in connection with the federal bank bailout program in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis has reached a settlement with federal securities regulators in a related civil action.In a court filing Tuesday, attorneys for William North and the Securities and Exchange Commission asked a federal judge in Delaware to suspend activity in the SEC's lawsuit against North pending commission authorization of the proposed consent judgment. The commission's review is expected to take six to eight weeks. Details of the proposed settlement were not included in the court filing.North is the former chief credit officer for Wilmington Trust. He, along with former bank president Robert Harra, former chief financial officer David Gibson and former controller Kevyn Rakowski, were convicted in 2018 on criminal charges of fraud, conspiracy and making false statements regarding the bank’s troubled commercial loan portfolio.The bank itself also was criminally charged but reached a $60 million settlement with prosecutors just as a trial was set to start.The executives received prison sentences ranging from three to six years, but a federal appeals court panel reversed their convictions for making false statements and ordered that judgments of acquittals be entered. The panel also ordered a retrial of the conspiracy and securities fraud charges, but prosecutors later opted to drop the case altogether.Meanwhile, the SEC filed a civil lawsuit claiming that the executives knowingly or recklessly made false disclosures regarding the bank’s loan portfolio.Gibson and Rakowski finalized settlements with the SEC in 2019, agreeing to pay more than $70,000 and $44,000, respectively, to the agency. Harra agreed last year to pay a civil penalty of $100,000 to resolve the claims against him.An attorney for North deferred comment Tuesday, noting that the commission has not yet approved the settlement.In a separate civil action, Wilmington Trust agreed to pay $200 million cash to settle a shareholder lawsuit alleging fraudulent concealment of billions of dollars in bad loans. Auditing firm KPMG agreed to pay an additional $10 million as part of the settlement.In the criminal case, prosecutors alleged that the executives misled regulators and investors about Wilmington Trust’s massive amount of past-due commercial real estate loans before the bank was hastily sold in 2011 while bordering on collapse.Founded by members of the DuPont family in 1903, the bank imploded despite receiving $330 million from the federal Troubled Asset Relief Program.Prosecutors said bank officials waived millions of dollars in matured loans from reporting requirements if they were designated as “current for interest” and in the process of being extended. To ensure that loans well past their repayment dates were purportedly exempt from reporting requirements, the bank lent even more money to struggling developers just to make the interest payments.In the fourth quarter of 2009, bank officials reported only $10.8 million in commercial loans as 90 days or more past due, concealing more than $316 million in past-due loans subject to the waiver practice, according to prosecutors.In one email to Harra, North referred to certain loans as “credit turds.”Meanwhile, before its 2011 fire sale to M&T Bank, Wilmington Trust raised $287 million in a 2010 stock offering, intended partly to help repay the TARP funds, while hiding the truth about its shaky financial condition from investors, prosecutors said.Defense attorneys argued that the waiver practice had been in place for decades and was no secret. They also maintained that instructions for filing reports with the Federal Reserve and for disclosing financial information in SEC filings were ambiguous, and that the term “past due” was not clearly defined.The appeals court agreed that the reporting requirements were ambiguous.",2023/02/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810337,GOP leaders start laying groundwork for more Ukraine aid,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Testimony on Russian war crimes. Monthly classified briefings. High-profile hearings, TV appearances and even op-eds in conservative media outlets.

            Leading Republicans in Congress are not waiting for the next debate over assistance to Ukraine, instead launching an early and aggressive effort to make the case for why the U.S. should continue spending billions of dollars on the war effort.

            One of their main challenges: winning over skeptical Republican colleagues.











            “I’m very much focused on the dissension within my own party on this,” Republican Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told The Associated Press. 

            McCaul plans to hold a hearing in the spring focused on Russian atrocities against Ukrainian civilians, to try to bring home the war’s terrible toll. 

            “I find that moves the dial, when they see these horrific killings of children,” McCaul said.

            The task ahead is challenging, particularly in the House. While Republicans have often been the nation’s leading defense hawks, eager for the U.S. to defend its interests through foreign action, former President Donald Trump’s “America First” approach has emboldened a noninterventionist wing that is ascendant. They are clamoring for the Ukraine aid to come to an end.

            The top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Rep. Gregory Meeks of New York, said of the Republicans across the aisle: “There are some that I’ve talked to, they don’t realize the interest the United States has in it.”

            Last week, a group of 11 House Republicans led by Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida unveiled a “Ukraine Fatigue” resolution. It stated that the U.S. “must end its military and financial aid to Ukraine” and urged the combatants to “reach a peace agreement.”

            “America is in a state of managed decline, and it will exacerbate if we continue to hemorrhage taxpayer dollars toward a foreign war,"" Gaetz said. 

            The U.S. has provided four rounds of aid to Ukraine in response to Russia’s invasion, totaling about $113 billion, with some of the money going toward replenishment of U.S. military equipment that was sent to the frontlines. 

            Congress approved the latest round of aid in December. While the package was designed to last through the end of the fiscal year in September, much depends upon events on the ground. Officials in Kyiv anticipate a new Russian offensive in coming weeks around the anniversary of the Feb. 24 invasion, which could hasten Ukraine’s need for more military and economic assistance.

            But another funding request is certain to face heavy resistance from lawmakers closely aligned with Trump and budget hawks worried about the nation's $31 trillion in government debt.

            “We’ve got to get our financial house in order in the United States before we put any more dollars overseas for things like that,” said Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C. “We’ve met our goal for Ukraine.”

            McCaul, as the new Republican chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, is now a key player in U.S. funding decisions. He is working to bring in Ukrainian Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin to testify about the violence being inflicted on civilians. 

            A team of experts commissioned by the U.N.’s top human rights body found last year that Russian forces are responsible for the vast majority of war crimes and human rights violations in Ukraine. The commission documented patterns of summary executions, unlawful confinement, torture, rape and other sexual violence. 

            McCaul said he wants his colleagues and the public to see clearly what is happening in Ukraine and why U.S. aid is so vital.

            “It’s not a question of either or,” McCaul said. “We’re a great country. We can secure our border and protect freedom and democracy around the world, which is what Ukraine is all about.”

            With opponents of Ukraine spending warning of fraud and corruption, the House Armed Services Committee is planning to hold monthly classified briefings for lawmakers to detail, dollar by dollar, how the U.S. security aid is being allocated. 

            The briefings will be every two weeks for key staff, said Armed Services Chairman Mike Rogers of Alabama, and a public hearing is in the works “to try to get more visibility for the public into the tracking that we’re doing.”

            One of the challenges in ensuring accountability is the sheer number of activities that U.S. dollars are supporting. 

            U.S. dollars not only go to Stinger missiles to take out Russian aircraft, Javelin missiles to take out tanks, but also for food, water and shelter for refugees whose homes have been destroyed. The money also supports basic government services, such as medical care, firefighting and utilities.

            The inspectors general for the Defense and State departments and the U.S. Agency for International Development are the lead offices tracking Ukraine spending. Rogers said he is encouraging NATO to bring in a third party to track U.S. weapons to assure the public they don’t end up in the wrong hands.

            “We know it’s going to where it is supposed to, but how we know is classified,” Rogers said. “We’ve got to find a way to let the world know from somebody that they have confidence in.""

            Recent polling from Gallup found that about two-thirds of Americans support aid for Ukraine to help it regain its territory, even if it means a prolonged conflict. But that support varied depending upon political party. Nearly half of Republicans, or 47%, say the U.S. is doing too much compared with 35% of independents and just 10% of Democrats.

            In the Senate, Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky has consistently pressed the Biden administration for more robust action to help Ukraine win the war. He wore a bright blue and yellow tie to the State of the Union address last week — the colors of Ukraine’s flag — to trumpet his support.

            The ranking Republican on the Senate's Armed Services panel, Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, is using the bully pulpit as well. He spoke at length on the Senate floor about Ukraine and followed up with an op-ed in the National Review, a conservative outlet.

            “It is a relatively modest amount that we are contributing without being asked to risk life and limb,” Wicker told the AP. “The Ukrainians are willing to fight the fight for us if the West will give them the provisions. It’s a pretty good deal.” 

            ""And what we’ve done is expose Russia’s very soft, vulnerable underbelly and we’ve made it less likely that any of our NATO allies will be attacked.”

            But there are skeptics in the Senate, too. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said China is the U.S.’s top foreign adversary and that’s where Congress should be focusing its attention.

            “We need to tell our European friends they need to carry the burden of the conventional defense in Ukraine,” Hawley said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810338,FIFA targets 2030 World Cup host vote in September next year,"GENEVA (AP) — The 2030 World Cup hosts are expected to be picked in September next year, FIFA said Tuesday.

            FIFA's ruling council confirmed a timetable for bidding and a vote to be held in the third quarter of next year by around 200 member federations. FIFA has long targeted a decision in 2024 for the tournament that is currently scheduled to have 48 teams.

            A separate election meeting will be held earlier in 2024 to pick a host for the 2027 Women's World Cup, soccer's governing body said.











            The three 2026 hosts of the men's World Cup — the United States, Canada and Mexico — all had their expected automatic entries in the 48-team finals tournament confirmed Tuesday. It will be the first edition expanded from the 32-team tournament that was introduced in 1998.

            FIFA also picked Saudi Arabia — a potential candidate in the 2030 contest — to host the next Club World Cup from Dec. 12-22 in the latest addition to the kingdom's sports hosting ambitions.

            In the 2030 hosting race, co-hosting bids from South America and Europe have been the expected favorites, with Morocco also in the picture and speculation about a Saudi-led and unprecedented three-continent project.

            The inaugural 1930 World Cup host, Uruguay, is part of a centenary bid with Argentina, Chile and Paraguay.

            Spain and Portugal were joined last October for their longstanding European candidacy by Ukraine.

            Morocco committed to taking part in the 2030 contest more than four years ago immediately after losing the vote for the 2026 tournament to the North Americans.

            At the World Cup in Qatar in December, Moroccan soccer federation leader Fouzi Lekjaa was still open to reviving an old idea of Morocco joining its near-neighbors Spain and Portugal in an intercontinental bid.

            Saudi Arabia’s ambitions to host more soccer events have led to unconfirmed speculation of a 2030 bid with Egypt in Africa and Greece in Europe. It is unclear how European soccer body UEFA would deal with a member federation joining a rival bid.

            Such a bid also would require sending the tournament back to Asia and the Persian Gulf only eight years after Qatar hosted, so a Saudi bid for 2034 could be more realistic.

            The Saudi-hosted Club World Cup in December should be the last in the current seven-team format of continental champions plus the host nation’s domestic league winner.

            FIFA has set a June 2025 target to launch a tournament of 32 teams with European teams taking 12 entries.

            Continental allocations for the tournament were confirmed Tuesday with South America to get six teams, and four each going to Asia, Africa and the CONCACAF region, plus one to Oceania. The host nation will get the last slot.

            The United States is a potential host for the 2025 Club World Cup as a test event for the following year's World Cup.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810339,"Panthers add former Colts, Lions coach Caldwell as assistant","CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — The Carolina Panthers added even more experience to new coach Frank Reich’s staff on Tuesday, hiring Jim Caldwell as a senior assistant. 

            The 68-year-old Caldwell brings a wealth of NFL experience, having coached the Detroit Lions and Indianapolis Colts. His hire comes just days after the Panthers added 72-year-old Dom Capers, a former head coach with Carolina and the Houston Texans, to their staff as a defensive assistant.

            Caldwell will report directly to Reich and will help the team on offense, defense and special teams.











            The Panthers also named Duce Staley their running backs coach and assistant head coach. Staley worked together with Reich in Philadelphia, where they helped the Eagles to a Super Bowl title five years ago. He previously served as assistant head coach for the Eagles (2018-20) and the Detroit Lions (2021-22).

            Caldwell was one of nine candidates to interview for the coaching vacancy and the second — along with new defensive coordinator Ejiro Evero — to ultimately join the team despite not getting the job.

            Caldwell and Reich have worked together before: Caldwell was assistant head coach and quarterbacks coach under Tony Dungy when Reich broke into the coaching ranks in 2006. The Colts won Super Bowl that year. When Dungy retired, Caldwell was promoted to head coach and Reich was named quarterbacks coach.

            Caldwell spent seven seasons as an NFL head coach — three with the Colts and four with the Lions. He compiled a 62-50 record and reached the playoffs four times, including a trip to the Super Bowl in 2009.

            He also won a Super Bowl ring as offensive coordinator with the Baltimore Ravens.

            Panthers owner David Tepper talked at Reich's introductory news conference about the importance of building a quality coaching staff.

            The Panthers still have holes to fill on Reich's staff, including naming an offensive coordinator. Regardless of who they add, Reich is still expected to be the play caller on offense.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810341,Pence to fight special counsel subpoena on 2020 election,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Former Vice President Mike Pence is planning to fight a subpoena by the special counsel overseeing investigations into efforts by former President Donald Trump and his allies to overturn the results of the 2020 election, according to people familiar with his thinking.

            Pence and his attorneys are planning to cite constitutional grounds as they prepare to resist special counsel Jack Smith's efforts to compel his testimony before a grand jury. They argue that because Pence was serving in his role as president of the Senate on Jan. 6, 2021 as he presided over a joint session of Congress to certify the election results, he is protected from being forced to address his actions under the Constitution's “speech-or-debate” clause that shields members of Congress.

            “I think he views it as essential protection of his Constitutional role,"" said Marc Short, a close adviser to Pence who served as his White House chief of staff. 











            Short compared Pence’s position to the one he took on Jan. 6 when he refused to go along with Trump’s unconstitutional scheme to try to overturn the results of the 2020 election, as well as Pence's rejection of using the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office in the aftermath.

            “The vice president of the United State is the president of the Senate and the fact is the functions of Jan. 6 were specific to that role,"" he said of Pence, who has been laying the groundwork for a likely presidential campaign that would put him in direct competition against his former boss. 

            Whether Pence's arguments will succeed in limiting or altogether avoiding grand jury testimony is unclear, but the Justice Department is expected to oppose those efforts and to make the case that the former vice president's cooperation is essential for a probe focused on Trump's actions.

            The decision to try to fight the subpoena, which was first reported by Politico, marks a change in posture from Pence, who has cooperated with the Justice Department as it investigates how documents with classified markings ended up at his Indiana home after the end of the Trump administration. He permitted the FBI to search the property last week.

            Even if his objection is ultimately rebuffed from the courts, an antagonistic posture could allow Pence to argue that he tried to fight the Justice Department — a potentially useful position in a GOP primary, as many in the Republican base have grown distrustful of federal law enforcement, in part due to Trump's drumbeat of criticism. And it could delay the special counsel probe, which Smith is working to rapidly advance.

            Pence has spoken extensively about Trump’s pressure campaign urging him to reject President Joe Biden's victory in the days leading up to Jan. 6, including in his book, “So Help Me God.” Pence, as vice president, had a ceremonial role overseeing the counting of the Electoral College vote, but did not have the power to impact the results.

            Pence's decision to resist the subpoena also came after extensive back-and-forth between his lawyers and the special counsel's office, according to a person familiar with the discussions who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door negotiations.

            The Justice Department declined to comment Tuesday on Pence's plans.

            Pence is expected to address the issue in more detail during a visit to Iowa Wednesday as he inches closer to a likely presidential run.

            Richard Levy, a constitutional law professor at the University of Kansas, said it is true that the vice president is in a unique position as the technical presiding officer of the Senate, making the officeholder in some respects a member of the chamber.

            But he said that not everything a member does is protected by the speech-or-debate clause and it is debatable whether the vice president’s role in certifying the election, which involves a mix of constitutional and senatorial functions, would be protected.

            In any event, Pence’s argument would likely serve to limit the scope of his testimony rather than to block it altogether, he said.

            “I don’t think the speech or debate clause would be a basis for quashing the subpoena altogether. It would be a basis for objecting to particular questions,” he said.

            The subpoena has been an aggressive step from Smith as he continues to investigate efforts by Trump and his allies to remain in power, including the storming of the Capitol building on Jan. 6.

            Trump supporters, driven by the lie that the election was stolen, brutally pushed past the police and smashed through the windows and doors while Pence was presiding over the certification of Biden’s victory. The vice president was steered to safety with his staff and family as some in the mob chanted, “Hang Mike Pence!”

            While the mob was in the Capitol, Trump tweeted, “Mike Pence didn’t have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution.”

            A House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack recommended that the Justice Department bring criminal charges against Trump and others over his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss.WASHINGTON (AP) — Former Vice President Mike Pence is planning to fight a subpoena by the special counsel overseeing investigations into efforts by former President Donald Trump and his allies to overturn the results of the 2020 election, according to people familiar with his thinking.Pence and his attorneys are planning to cite constitutional grounds as they prepare to resist special counsel Jack Smith's efforts to compel his testimony before a grand jury. They argue that because Pence was serving in his role as president of the Senate on Jan. 6, 2021 as he presided over a joint session of Congress to certify the election results, he is protected from being forced to address his actions under the Constitution's “speech-or-debate” clause that shields members of Congress.“I think he views it as essential protection of his Constitutional role,"" said Marc Short, a close adviser to Pence who served as his White House chief of staff.Short compared Pence’s position to the one he took on Jan. 6 when he refused to go along with Trump’s unconstitutional scheme to try to overturn the results of the 2020 election, as well as Pence's rejection of using the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office in the aftermath.“The vice president of the United State is the president of the Senate and the fact is the functions of Jan. 6 were specific to that role,"" he said of Pence, who has been laying the groundwork for a likely presidential campaign that would put him in direct competition against his former boss.Whether Pence's arguments will succeed in limiting or altogether avoiding grand jury testimony is unclear, but the Justice Department is expected to oppose those efforts and to make the case that the former vice president's cooperation is essential for a probe focused on Trump's actions.The decision to try to fight the subpoena, which was first reported by Politico, marks a change in posture from Pence, who has cooperated with the Justice Department as it investigates how documents with classified markings ended up at his Indiana home after the end of the Trump administration.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810343,German ballet director issues apology over feces attack,"BERLIN (AP) — A German ballet director issued a public apology on Tuesday for smearing dog feces on the face of a newspaper critic whose reviews he had taken exception to.

            Marco Goecke was suspended from his post as ballet chief at the Hannover state opera following the weekend incident. T he theater's management called on him Monday to apologize “comprehensively” and explain himself.

            According to the daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Goecke approached its dance critic, Wiebke Huester, during the interval of a premiere at the opera house on Saturday and asked what she was doing there.











            The newspaper said that Goecke, who apparently felt provoked by a recent review she wrote of a production he staged in the Netherlands, threatened to ban her from the ballet and accused her of being responsible for people canceling season tickets in Hannover. He then pulled out a paper bag with the feces and smeared her face with the contents.

            “I would like to apologize sincerely to all concerned, first and foremost to Ms. Huester, for my absolutely unacceptable act,” Goecke said in a written statement. “In retrospect, I am clearly aware that this was a disgraceful act in the heat of the moment and an overreaction,” he added.

            However, he added that it's time for media to “rethink a certain form of destructive and hurtful reporting that damages the whole cultural sector” and criticized Huester for what he said were “often nasty reviews.”

            Goecke pointed to the “nervous strain” resulting from two premieres in quick succession as a reason for his actions.

            “I apologize for the fact that I finally blew my top, but I also ask for a certain understanding at least for the reasons why this happened,” he wrote.

            Huester filed a criminal complaint after the incident. Goecke faces an investigation on suspicion of bodily harm and slander.

            Goecke has said his elderly dachshund had defecated earlier, and he had packed the mess into a bag and had been planning to dispose of it. While he says he then acted in the heat of the moment, the critic has contended that it was a premeditated attack.

            Huester said she was shocked by Goecke’s statement on Tuesday.

            “What kind of an apology is this supposed to be?” she asked on 3sat television, describing it as an attempted justification of his actions, German news agency dpa reported.BERLIN (AP) — A German ballet director issued a public apology on Tuesday for smearing dog feces on the face of a newspaper critic whose reviews he had taken exception to.Marco Goecke was suspended from his post as ballet chief at the Hannover state opera following the weekend incident.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810344,Autopsy: Death of ex-state NAACP president ruled a suicide,"A civil rights advocate and former president of the North Carolina branch of the NAACP died by suicide in his Greensboro home last summer, according to an autopsy report released Tuesday. 

            The Rev. T. Anthony Spearman, 71, who also served as president of the N.C. Council of Churches, was found on a basement couch on July 19, 2022, according to a report by the North Carolina Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. 

            The report stated that family had discovered Spearman while conducting a welfare check. 











            Spearman was “last seen alive the night before on a Zoom meeting and reported to be in good spirits during the meeting,” the report stated. 

            ___

            EDITOR’S NOTE — This story includes discussion of suicide. If you or someone you know needs help, please dial 988 to reach the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.

            ___

            Spearman's death had drawn widespread attention, with his work as an activist being praised by the likes of Bishop William J. Barber, who preceded Spearman as the state's NAACP president. But few details about Spearman's death had been released until Tuesday, nearly seven months after his passing. The autopsy states that Spearman died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

            
                A 911 call that was placed about a week before Spearman’s death indicated an armed robbery took place at his house. 

            Spearman alleged that a man asked for $2,000, which Spearman said he didn’t have, according to audio from a 911 call on July 13 and a magistrate’s order. The man is alleged to have taken Spearman’s cellphone and tried to use an app to transfer money to his account.

            Spearman said the man pulled a gun and when Spearman grabbed it, a shot was fired. Spearman said he wasn’t hurt.

            Records also show that the man hit Spearman with the gun before he fled with his cellphone, according to a magistrate’s order. The man was arrested and charged the same day with robbery with a dangerous weapon and assault with intent to kill. He was later released on a $15,000 bond.

            That incident was acknowledged in the investigative report released Tuesday with Spearman's autopsy. 

            Spearman was elected North Carolina NAACP president in 2017 and served one four-year term.

            Spearman’s family issued a statement following his death last year, calling him “a man of strong conviction who loved his family with every ounce of his being.”

            Barber, who is now president of the national, not-for-profit organization Repairers of the Breach, said last year that he had ""lost a true brother in the struggle.”

            “We have lost a scholar, a preacher, a voting rights defender, an advocate for prison reform and for the wrongfully accused and a stalwart soldier in the cause of love and justice for all humankind,” Barber said. “This great man’s efforts and commitment should be cherished.”A civil rights advocate and former president of the North Carolina branch of the NAACP died by suicide in his Greensboro home last summer, according to an autopsy report released Tuesday.The Rev.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810345,"Hyundai, Kia update security after TikTok challenge thefts","Hyundai and Kia are rolling out software updates to stem a raft of auto thefts related to a TikTok challenge that authorities believe has led to at least 14 reported crashes and eight fatalities. 

            The updates are free for millions of vehicles that are missing a key anti-theft device, an issue that was exploited on social media and led to rampant theft of the cars.

            The software being released updates the theft alarm software logic to extend the length of the alarm sound from 30 seconds to one minute and requires the key to be in the ignition switch to turn the vehicle on.











            About 3.8 million Hyundais and 4.5 million Kias are eligible for the software update, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Tuesday. 

            Hyundai said updates begin Tuesday for nearly 4 million vehicles beginning with a million model year 2017-2020 Elantra, 2015-2019 Sonata and 2020-2021 Venue vehicles. The software upgrade is scheduled to be available for the remaining eligible vehicles by June. 

            “We have prioritized the upgrade’s availability for owners and lessees of our highest selling vehicles and those most targeted by thieves in order for dealers to service them first,"" said Randy Parker, CEO of Hyundai Motor America. 

            Kia said it had already begun to update the software for some vehicles. 

            In September the Highway Loss Data Institute, a unit of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, found that Hyundais and Kias without immobilizers had a vehicle theft claim rate of 2.18 per 1,000 insured vehicle years. The rest of the industry combined had a rate of 1.21. An insured vehicle year is equal to one vehicle insured for one year.

            The institute compared vehicles from the 2015 through 2019 model years. It studied vehicle theft claims from 2021.

            Hyundai says all models produced after Nov. 1, 2021 have immobilizers as standard equipment.

            A TikTok social media challenge put a spotlight on the vehicles' lack of an immobilizer and resulted in at least 14 reported crashes and eight fatalities, according to the NHTSA. The challenge shows TikTok viewers how to hot-wire Kia and Hyundai cars with a USB cord and a screwdriver. 

            In October a police commissioner said that a car crash in Buffalo, New York that left four teenagers dead may have been linked to the TikTok challenge. In the incident, a total of six teenagers were in a speeding Kia that crashed, Buffalo police said. The car had been reported stolen.

            Hyundai and Kia will start software updates later this month, with subsequent phases over the next several months. Hyundai will also provide window stickers to vehicle owners that alert would-be thieves that the vehicle has anti-theft protection.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810346,Separatist rebels in Papua say kidnapped NZ pilot is safe,"JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — Separatist rebels in Indonesia’s restive Papua province released photos and videos Tuesday of a man they said is the pilot from New Zealand whom they took hostage last week.

            Phillip Mark Mehrtens of Christchurch, a pilot for Indonesian aviation company Susi Air, was abducted by independence fighters from the West Papua Liberation Army, the armed wing of the Free Papua Movement, who stormed his single-engine plane shortly after it landed on a small runway in Paro in remote Nduga district.

            The plane, carrying five passengers, was scheduled to pick up 15 construction workers who had been building a health center in Paro after a group of separatist rebels led by Egianus Kogoya threatened to kill them, said Nduga district chief Namia Gwijangge.











            “Our plan to evacuate the workers angered the rebels, who responded by setting fire to the plane and seizing the pilot,” said Gwijangge, who was one of the passengers. “We deeply regret this incident.”

            Flying is the only practical way of accessing many parts of the mountainous area.

            The rebels released all five passengers because they are indigenous Papuans, rebel spokesperson Sebby Sambom said earlier.

            Sambom sent videos and photos Tuesday to The Associated Press that showed a group of gunmen, led by Kogoya, setting fire to the plane on the runway. Sitting in the plane’s cockpit, Kogoya said he took the pilot hostage as part of their struggle “to free Papua” from Indonesia.

            Another video showed a man identified as Mehrtens standing in a forest surrounded by a group of people armed with rifles, spears and bows and arrows. In a third video, the man was ordered by the rebels to say, “Indonesia must recognize Papua is independent.”

            “I took him hostage for Papua independence, not for food or drinks,” Kogoya said in the video with the man standing next to him. “He will be safe with me as long as Indonesia does not use its arms, either from the air or on the ground.”

            Coordinating Minister for Political, Security and Legal Affairs Mohammad Mahfud said the government was making every effort to persuade the rebels to release Mehrtens “because the priority is the safety of the hostage.”

            “Taking civilians hostage for any reason is unacceptable,” Mahfud said in a video statement late Tuesday. He said persuasion is the best method to ensure hostage safety, but “the government does not rule out other efforts.”

            He emphasized the government’s view that Papua is part of Indonesia.

            “Papua will forever remain a legitimate part of the unitary state of the Republic of Indonesia,” Mahfud said.

            New Zealand's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade said Wednesday in a statement: “We are aware of the photos and video circulating but won’t be commenting further at this stage.”

            Papua police chief Mathius Fakhiri told reporters in Jayapura, the provincial capital, that they are seeking to obtain the pilot’s freedom by involving several community leaders, including tribal and church figures, to build communication and negotiate with the rebels.

            Conflicts between Indigenous Papuans and Indonesian security forces are common in the impoverished Papua region, a former Dutch colony in the western part of New Guinea that is ethnically and culturally distinct from much of Indonesia. Papua was incorporated into Indonesia in 1969 after a U.N.-sponsored ballot that was widely seen as a sham. Since then, a low-level insurgency has simmered in the mineral-rich region.

            The 15 construction workers, who were rescued Feb. 8 by security forces, came from other Indonesian islands to build the health center in Paro. They had taken refuge in a priest’s house in the village for several days after rebels threatened to kill them.

            Separatists consider civilian workers to be outsiders who sometimes spy for the Indonesian government.

            Conflict in the region has risen in the past year, with dozens of rebels, security forces and civilians killed.JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — Separatist rebels in Indonesia’s restive Papua province released photos and videos Tuesday of a man they said is the pilot from New Zealand whom they took hostage last week.Phillip Mark Mehrtens of Christchurch, a pilot for Indonesian aviation company Susi Air, was abducted by independence fighters from the West Papua Liberation Army, the armed wing of the Free Papua Movement, who stormed his single-engine plane shortly after it landed on a small runway in Paro in remote Nduga district.The plane, carrying five passengers, was scheduled to pick up 15 construction workers who had been building a health center in Paro after a group of separatist rebels led by Egianus Kogoya threatened to kill them, said Nduga district chief Namia Gwijangge.“Our plan to evacuate the workers angered the rebels, who responded by setting fire to the plane and seizing the pilot,” said Gwijangge, who was one of the passengers. “We deeply regret this incident.”Flying is the only practical way of accessing many parts of the mountainous area.The rebels released all five passengers because they are indigenous Papuans, rebel spokesperson Sebby Sambom said earlier.Sambom sent videos and photos Tuesday to The Associated Press that showed a group of gunmen, led by Kogoya, setting fire to the plane on the runway.

He said persuasion is the best method to ensure hostage safety, but “the government does not rule out other efforts.”He emphasized the government’s view that Papua is part of Indonesia.“Papua will forever remain a legitimate part of the unitary state of the Republic of Indonesia,” Mahfud said.New Zealand's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade said Wednesday in a statement: “We are aware of the photos and video circulating but won’t be commenting further at this stage.”Papua police chief Mathius Fakhiri told reporters in Jayapura, the provincial capital, that they are seeking to obtain the pilot’s freedom by involving several community leaders, including tribal and church figures, to build communication and negotiate with the rebels.Conflicts between Indigenous Papuans and Indonesian security forces are common in the impoverished Papua region, a former Dutch colony in the western part of New Guinea that is ethnically and culturally distinct from much of Indonesia. Papua was incorporated into Indonesia in 1969 after a U.N.-sponsored ballot that was widely seen as a sham. Since then, a low-level insurgency has simmered in the mineral-rich region.The 15 construction workers, who were rescued Feb. 8 by security forces, came from other Indonesian islands to build the health center in Paro. They had taken refuge in a priest’s house in the village for several days after rebels threatened to kill them.Separatists consider civilian workers to be outsiders who sometimes spy for the Indonesian government.Conflict in the region has risen in the past year, with dozens of rebels, security forces and civilians killed.",2023/02/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810347,West Indies beats Zimbabwe inside 3 days to clinch series,"BULAWAYO, Zimbabwe (AP) — Left-arm spinner Gudakesh Motie's six wickets helped West Indies defeat Zimbabwe by an innings and four runs inside three days to clinch the two-match test series 1-0 Tuesday. 

            Motie, who took seven wickets in Zimbabwe’s first innings, was again the chief tormentor with 6-62 as the hosts collapsed to 173 all out in a wobbly effort to make West Indies bat again. The first test ended in a draw last week.

            West Indies put up a lead of 177 runs at the Queens Sports Club after Zimbabwe had been skittled for 115 before the Caribbean side finished 292 all out on day three.











            The touring side added just two runs to its overnight score, allowing Zimbabwe seamer Victor Nyauchi (5-56) to remove Jason Holder (3) and Gudakesh Motie for 12 to complete his maiden test cricket five-for.

            Roston Chase (70) held together West Indies’ innings with a well measured knock to put the tourists in command on the second day.

            Right-hander Chase had put on 60 for the fifth wicket with Kyle Mayers (30), and then shared a partnership of 85 for the sixth wicket alongside wicketkeeper Joshua Silva (44). Raymon Reifer (53) was the other West Indies batsman in the runs with a workmanlike half-century of his own.

            Zimbabwe was then unable to make West Indies bat again, falling four runs short of the target to bring the West Indies back to the crease. 

            West Indies captain Kraigg Brathwaite said the success in Zimbabwe is crucial for momentum when his team crosses into South Africa for a multiple format tour, beginning with two tests starting on Feb. 28 at SuperSport Park.

            “It’s a good feeling, I think winning any game is always a habit, winning is a habit,” Brathwaite told reporters. ""So this is very important. It will be a tougher South Africa team, and we will see when we get there. ... The more test cricket you play, the better. It’s good to have these two back-to-back series, we don’t take it lightly.”

            Craig Ervine, Zimbabwe’s stand-in captain, acknowledged it was frustrating that Zimbabwe’s in-form players haven’t been able to convert their promising starts to put the African side in good positions.

            Ervine himself top-scored with 72 for Zimbabwe in a relatively comfortable innings before being trapped lbw by Motie.

            The second highest scorer, opener Innocent Kaia (43) was out when he had looked well set, faintly edging to the keeper a Motie delivery that moved through the air.

            “It could be a number of factors, it could be a question of lack of application,” Ervine said. “And as you know in test cricket, 50s, 60s don’t win you matches. And as you saw Gary (Ballance) in that first test, getting a big hundred. Those hundreds make a big difference. That partnership between himself and Brandon Mavuta (who scored a maiden half-century) got us back into the game. So guys really need to work on their application.”

            Monken arrives after three seasons in the same role at Georgia, which last month won its second consecutive national championship. Baltimore coach John Harbaugh said the team conducted 21 interviews with 14 candidates.

            “Todd's leadership and coaching acumen were evident from the beginning,” Harbaugh said. “He has a proven track record for designing and teaching offensive systems that allow players to succeed at the highest level. We're excited to get to work and begin building an offense that will help us compete for championships.""











            The 57-year-old Monken does have NFL experience as well, serving as the offensive coordinator for the Cleveland Browns in 2019 and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for three seasons before that. He was the head coach at Southern Mississippi from 2013-15.

            Monken replaces Greg Roman, whose tenure with the Ravens ended after the team averaged just 13.6 points over its final six games before losing in the wild-card round to Cincinnati. Star quarterback Lamar Jackson was injured down the stretch — and his future is uncertain because he does not have a contract for next season.

            Incorporating singles known for their catchy rhythms, like 2021's “Bunny is a Rider"" and last summer's “Sunset,” into a swath of eerie meditations, like “Crude Drawing of an Angel"" and “Hopedrunk Everasking,"" Polachek imbues pastoral harmonies and vocal flares into her romanticism, primeval drifting into the future.

Brìghde Chaimbeul’s earthy bagpipe flourishes in multiple songs, and fellow artists Dido and Grimes collaborate in the fluttery “Fly to You.” While instrumental sharpness singles her album out, Polachek's lyrics the elevate the romantic effect, either with magical realism, cheeky puns or plain desire.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810352,AP source: Shannon Dawson to Miami as offensive coordinator,"Miami is hiring Houston assistant Shannon Dawson to be its offensive coordinator, a person with knowledge of the decision told The Associated Press on Tuesday.

            The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the deal was still being finalized and needed approval from the university.

            Dawson has spent the last four years with Houston, the last three of those as its offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach. In those three years, Houston has thrown 87 touchdown passes, which is 13th-most among all FBS programs.











            The Cougars also have completed 65.2% of their passes in that span and thrown for 10,010 yards — both of those stats ranking 21st nationally over the last three years.

            Dawson previously was an offensive coordinator at Southern Miss, Kentucky, West Virginia, Stephen F. Austin and Millsaps. Dawson has coached in eight bowl games — including an Orange Bowl with West Virginia — along with the FCS playoffs and the Division III playoffs.

            At Miami, Dawson will replace Josh Gattis, who was fired last month after the Hurricanes went 5-7 in his only season at the school.

            Miami’s offense failed to meet expectations in 2022. Part of that was injuries: Starting quarterback Tyler Van Dyke battled a shoulder injury, and the Hurricanes turned to Jake Garcia — who has since transferred — and Jacurri Brown for much of the season.

            Miami scored 100 points in its first two games last fall, overpowering Bethune-Cookman and Southern Miss. The Hurricanes averaged only 18.3 points the rest of the way, and finished the year 5-0 in games where the defense allowed no more than 14 points — but 0-7 when opponents scored more than 14.

            Miami was 86th nationally in total offense last season, averaging 367.1 yards per game, and 97th in scoring offense.

            Dawson is the second coordinator Miami coach Mario Cristobal has hired this month. He also landed Lance Guidry, who was defensive coordinator at Marshall last season and had accepted the same position at Tulane. Guidry is replacing Kevin Steele, who left the Hurricanes for Alabama.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810353,UN appeals for $397 million to help Syrian quake survivors,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The United Nations chief launched a $397 million appeal Tuesday to help nearly 5 million survivors of last week’s devastating earthquake in rebel-held northwest Syria who have received very little assistance because of deep divisions exacerbated by the country’s 12-year war.

            Secretary-General Antonio Guterres announced the appeal a day after he welcomed an agreement between the U.N. and Syrian President Bashar Assad to open two new crossing points from Turkey for an initial period of three months. The U.N. has only been allowed to deliver aid to the northwest Idlib area through a single crossing at Bab Al-Hawa -- at Syrian ally Russia’s insistence. Since the quake, the U.N. says 84 trucks have gone through Bab Al-Hawa.

            Guterres said the devastation from the magnitude 7.8 earthquake that ravaged southern Turkey and northwestern Syria on Feb. 6 “is one of the worst in recent memory,” and “we all know that lifesaving aid has not been getting in at the speed and scale needed.”











            He said the $397 million will provide “desperately needed, life-saving relief for nearly 5 million Syrians — including shelter, health care, food and protection” for three months.

            Guterres said the U.N. is in the final stages of preparing an emergency appeal for quake-ravaged southern Turkey. U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said the appeal will be launched “probably in the coming days.”

            He urged the international community to provide the emergency funding without delay, saying: “The human suffering from this epic natural disaster should not be made even worse by manmade obstacles — access, funding, supplies.”

            The secretary-general said aid to Syria must get through by all routes to all areas without restrictions.

            A senior U.N. World Food Program official warned that food insecurity in afflicted parts of Syria had been rising drastically even before the earthquake struck.

            “It was very bad before. Now it’s dramatic,” said Corinne Fleischer, the agency’s Middle East Director.

            “Half of the population faces hunger. And that’s the worst that we’ve seen since the beginning of the crisis in Syria. Even at the height of the war, we didn’t have 12 million people food insecure,” she said in an interview with the Associated Press.

            Guterres announced that an 11-truck convoy was on the move to go through one of the newly opened crossings at Bab Al-Salam, “with many more to come.” He said the second new crossing at Al Raée is also open, “and goods are flowing.”

            Dujarric said the convoy went through the crossing without any obstacles and “we’re very optimistic that things will move quickly.” He noted that the two crossings have been used by relief organizations not affiliated with the U.N. and the roads are in better condition than those leading to Bab Al-Hawa.

            The announcement of the two additional crossings from Turkey came as the U.N. Security Council was meeting for the first time Monday afternoon on the difficulties of getting aid to northwest Syria.

            The U.N. has also been trying to send a convoy to the northwest across conflict lines within Syria, but it hasn’t gotten a green light from all parties. The convoy has reportedly been blocked by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a rebel group with ties to al-Qaida that controls part of the northwest.

            France’s U.N. ambassador, Nicolas De Riviere, told reporters before Monday’s council meeting that there were two options — either the Syrian government grant additional access to the northwest or the council would try to adopt a resolution authorizing additional crossing points to the region.

            After the meeting and the announcement of the two new crossings, De Riviere said there should be no “obstacles” to delivering aid through the three crossings. If there are, he said, the Security Council should look into adopting a resolution under Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter, which means it can be enforced militarily, to authorize the crossings and get aid to the millions in need.

            U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said the United States will be watching closely to see if aid is getting to Syrians in need and will push for a U.N. resolution if it isn’t. “It took seven days to get this decision to allow the borders to be open -- that decision should have been made on day one,” she said. 

            Secretary-General Guterres, asked about a possible meeting with president Assad, said what’s needed now is not high-level visits that divert resources but stepped-up relief efforts.

            “I am following that very, very closely,” he said, “and whenever it would be useful and positive, I am ready to do whatever is needed.”

            As for whether a Security Council resolution is needed, he reiterated that the two new crossings are open, “and we will see, of course, if the situation would change, we would adopt the necessary measures.”

            Casert contributed from Brussels.UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The United Nations chief launched a $397 million appeal Tuesday to help nearly 5 million survivors of last week’s devastating earthquake in rebel-held northwest Syria who have received very little assistance because of deep divisions exacerbated by the country’s 12-year war.Secretary-General Antonio Guterres announced the appeal a day after he welcomed an agreement between the U.N. and Syrian President Bashar Assad to open two new crossing points from Turkey for an initial period of three months. The U.N. has only been allowed to deliver aid to the northwest Idlib area through a single crossing at Bab Al-Hawa -- at Syrian ally Russia’s insistence. Since the quake, the U.N. says 84 trucks have gone through Bab Al-Hawa.Guterres said the devastation from the magnitude 7.8 earthquake that ravaged southern Turkey and northwestern Syria on Feb. 6 “is one of the worst in recent memory,” and “we all know that lifesaving aid has not been getting in at the speed and scale needed.”He said the $397 million will provide “desperately needed, life-saving relief for nearly 5 million Syrians — including shelter, health care, food and protection” for three months.Guterres said the U.N. is in the final stages of preparing an emergency appeal for quake-ravaged southern Turkey. U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said the appeal will be launched “probably in the coming days.”He urged the international community to provide the emergency funding without delay, saying: “The human suffering from this epic natural disaster should not be made even worse by manmade obstacles — access, funding, supplies.”The secretary-general said aid to Syria must get through by all routes to all areas without restrictions.A senior U.N. World Food Program official warned that food insecurity in afflicted parts of Syria had been rising drastically even before the earthquake struck.“It was very bad before. Now it’s dramatic,” said Corinne Fleischer, the agency’s Middle East Director.“Half of the population faces hunger. And that’s the worst that we’ve seen since the beginning of the crisis in Syria. Even at the height of the war, we didn’t have 12 million people food insecure,” she said in an interview with the Associated Press.Guterres announced that an 11-truck convoy was on the move to go through one of the newly opened crossings at Bab Al-Salam, “with many more to come.” He said the second new crossing at Al Raée is also open, “and goods are flowing.”Dujarric said the convoy went through the crossing without any obstacles and “we’re very optimistic that things will move quickly.” He noted that the two crossings have been used by relief organizations not affiliated with the U.N. and the roads are in better condition than those leading to Bab Al-Hawa.The announcement of the two additional crossings from Turkey came as the U.N. Security Council was meeting for the first time Monday afternoon on the difficulties of getting aid to northwest Syria.The U.N. has also been trying to send a convoy to the northwest across conflict lines within Syria, but it hasn’t gotten a green light from all parties. The convoy has reportedly been blocked by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a rebel group with ties to al-Qaida that controls part of the northwest.France’s U.N. ambassador, Nicolas De Riviere, told reporters before Monday’s council meeting that there were two options — either the Syrian government grant additional access to the northwest or the council would try to adopt a resolution authorizing additional crossing points to the region.After the meeting and the announcement of the two new crossings, De Riviere said there should be no “obstacles” to delivering aid through the three crossings.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810355,Girls teams get their own division in peewee hockey tourney,"QUEBEC CITY (AP) — The autograph session over and her Olympic medal safely packed away, Charline Labonte acknowledged feeling a pang of jealousy during her latest visit to the International Peewee Hockey Tournament, where she played in net on a boys team in the early 1990s.

            The three-time Canadian gold medalist, who also appeared in 28 games for Quebec Major Junior Hockey League’s Acadie-Bathurst, wouldn’t change a thing about her past nor the challenges she and her trailblazing female contemporaries overcame in pursuing their dreams to play hockey.

            And yet, the 40-year-old experienced a sense of wonder in looking around Quebec City’s Videotron Centre, seeing collections of girls wearing their team uniforms in the hallways, stands and, most importantly, on the ice.











            “I wish I would have had those opportunities when I was younger,” Labonte said over the weekend. “To have the opportunity for young girls to compete against other girls, it shows that women’s hockey has grown so much over years ago. I think this is very exciting for them.”

            Though the 63-year-old tournament has been open to girls competing on boys teams or as all-girl teams in boys divisions, this year’s 11-day event was distinctly different: It launched its first girls peewee division, made up of 12 teams representing Canada, the United States, Switzerland, England and France. The three U.S.-based teams are from Connecticut, North Carolina and Florida.

            “The demand was there. So we said, ‘Now it’s time to stop celebrating the girls/women’s hockey once every four years. Now it’s time to celebrate every year,’” tournament general manager Patrick Dom said, referring to the four-year Olympic cycle. “It was time.”

            Because the tournament places an emphasis on international competition, the continued growth of girls hockey outside of North America was the tipping point. The 2022 Beijing Winter Games featured 10 nations, up from eight in 2018 and six when the sport was first introduced in 1998. There's also been a steady rise in the number of women’s pro leagues on both sides of the Atlantic.

            Twelve teams competed in Quebec City this year, and about 28 more were turned down, opening the possibility of the girls division expanding by four next year — even at the expense of reducing the number of boys teams.

            “If you take four more girls teams, you’re going to get four more calls from the boys teams saying, ‘Hey, the girls are taking our place.’ Well, you know what, this is what it is,"" Dom said. ""Women’s hockey needs to play, and it needs to be in the tournament.”

            The boys side features four divisions, and 108 teams, including the all-girl Etoiles Du Quebec, which opened the tournament with a 7-0 win over France’s Rouen Dragons in Class BB boys play Saturday.

            The cover of the tournament program features a girl holding up a hockey stick. Janes, a Canadian-based frozen food company, has signed on as the girls’ division sponsor. On Sunday, the tournament dedicated its prime early-afternoon ice times to a four-game stretch of girls division action, which included a woman as the public-address announcer and one game featuring an all-women crew of officials. 

            Another priority was ensuring girls games were played in the NHL-sized Videotron Centre instead of a smaller, secondary rink. 

            “It was very important to make sure that they get invited in the big door as the boys ... to make sure that they feel like they are not outsiders, but that they are part of it,” Dom said.

            Florida Alliance girls coach Shawn Ray is no stranger to the tournament. His previous trips to Quebec City came coaching boys teams from Long Island, New York, whose members included Boston Bruins defenseman Charlie McAvoy and his daughter, who is now playing in college.

            “Man, I wish my daughter was 12 years old again,” Ray said, noting she addressed his team by Facetime before its first game. “I don’t think people realize the effect that this is going to have on them until years down the road.”

            Florida Alliance player Cheyenne Friesen already has an inkling.

            “As soon as we stepped in here, everything was like so professional. So that’s when I realized how big of a deal it is to come here,” Friesen said. “I completely appreciate it. I think it’s really fun for all the girls, and it’s a fair game.”

            England defender Grace Reilly was so in awe of having the opportunity to size up the competition in playing her first international game that a 6-0 loss to Florida Alliance didn’t bother her.

            “This was our first proper game as a team, and I think from the start to the end, our team’s already improved massively,” Reilly said. “So by the end of this tournament, we’re going to be at another level. It’s crazy.”

            Developing the game in England is important, but so are the experiences coach Josie Lamey said her players are enjoying.

            “When they look back 20 years and say ‘I played in the first female tournament over here,’ it doesn’t matter that they lost six-nil in the first game,” Lamey said. “It’s about coming here and being involved and making memories forever.”

            Former U.S. national team defender and two-time Olympian Megan Bozek competed on both girls and boys teams in Quebec City, and made it a point of returning last weekend.

            “To have the 12 teams that have really pioneered this tournament, and to see where it grows in five to 10 years, is just incredible,” said Bozek, who addressed several girls teams. “To see girls get the same treatment, the same thing as boys, finally, finally. Yeah, it’s about time.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810357,Witnesses begin testifying in Guinea stadium massacre trial,"CONAKRY, Guinea (AP) — Oury Bailo Bah was on the phone with his brother when he heard crackling, gunshots and screams in the background at the stadium where protesters had gathered in 2009.

            He urged El Hadj Hassane Bah to stay on the line as he attempted to flee the gunfire from members of the presidential guard known as the red berets.

            “He was running and all of a sudden, apparently, the phone dropped because I could hear the surrounding noises, but not my brother,” Oury Bailo Bah said Tuesday. “He didn’t answer anymore.”











            Witnesses and victims' relatives, including Oury Bailo Bah, began giving testimony Tuesday in the trial of 11 defendants charged with murder over the Sept. 28, 2009 massacre that left at least 157 protesters dead and dozens of women raped. As many as 400 people are expected to testify in the coming weeks.

            Among those charged is former coup leader Moussa “Dadis” Camara, who testified in December that he had been asleep as the massacre unfolded.

            The demonstrators at the stadium that day were protesting Camara’s plans to run for president. The junta said “uncontrolled” elements of the army carried out the rapes and killings. But a Human Rights Watch investigation found that Camara’s top aides were at the stadium and did nothing to stop the violence.

            Several months later Camara survived an assassination attempt and fled to Burkina Faso where he lived in exile for more than a decade before returning to stand trial in Guinea.

            During his testimony Tuesday, Oury Bailo Bah described the chaos and heartbreak that confronted victims' families that day. After learning about the massacre on television, he went from hospital to hospital visiting morgues in hope of finding his brother's body.

            “Trucks came, three trucks full of bodies and wounded. I had never seen so much blood from a human being. Human blood was flowing as if we were at a butcher shop,” he recalled.

            It would take five more days before the families would be allowed to come and collect the bodies, he said. Dozens of corpses, though, were not there.

            Oury Bailo Bah says he knows his brother died that day — he held up a picture of his body in court on Tuesday that was taken in the aftermath of the violence at the stadium. But the family was never able to locate his remains.

            Oury Bailo Bah said he had tried to conceal that detail from his mother, hoping to spare her further grief by saying instead that his body was too decomposed to be buried.

            “She said to me: ‘Even if he is a mess, you have to put him in a bag and send him to me. I want to see it.’” he testified. “It was at that precise moment that I was forced to admit to her that the body had not been found.""

            “We don’t have a grave to gather at,” he said. “What we have left of him is his memory.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810359,Review: A Marvel villain comes into focus in ‘Ant-Man 3’,"Peyton Reed’s “Ant-Man” films have generally served as a kind of palate cleanser to the world-ending stakes of the larger Marvel Cinematic Universe. Paul Rudd’s Scott Lang is just an ordinary dude, or so they keep telling us, who still can’t really believe that he’s part of the Avengers at all. He gets to be the wide-eyed middle-aged fanboy of the group in those films. In his own films, he’s just living a blue-sky life in San Francisco as an affable single dad and ex-con who was once fired from Baskin Robbins and who has occasional enemies to defeat. 

            In this third film, “ Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania,” in theaters Thursday, he’s coasting on his own post-Blip celebrity with a best-selling memoir out, lots of fans around town and a generally sunny disposition — when he’s not breaking his teenage daughter Cassie (now played by Kathryn Newton, always an enjoyable presence) out of jail for civil disobedience. 

            There is a fun, light, sitcom-y touch to these early scenes in which he and his makeshift family, Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) sit around the table for takeout pizza. They use their particle technology to blow up the tiny pie. 











            “I just saved us $8,” Pym declares proudly. 

            But Ant-Man is part of the larger chess board of the MCU, so naturally he’s doomed to be sucked into the multiverse mess, setting up pieces for more Avengers films to come with the introduction of a new villain, Kang (played with a maniacal sorrow by the great Jonathan Majors). And the results are mixed. Reed has returned to direct with a new writer, Jeff Loveness, who has also been tapped to write “Avengers: The Kang Dynasty” and it’s hard not to empathize with both for the logic gymnastics required to back Ant-Man and his gang into this conflict. 

            Loveness, who cut his teeth in comedy and has an affinity for comic book and B-movie absurdities, gives Ant-Man his own “Star Wars”-adjacent adventure. There’s quite a bit of unrest in the Quantum Realm, with scrappy rebels battling against a powerful ruler with an army of faceless soldiers. But he takes that conceit further and gives the rebels some personality and humor, including William Jackson Harper as the mind-reading Quaz. The villain's a killing machine, M.O.D.O.K., that looks (knowingly) straight out of a “Mystery Science Theater 3000” movie and it is quite entertaining. It’s both a nod to the fun of the ridiculousness in sci-fi and a reminder that Serious Superhero Films are sometimes just one crazy special effect away from being Silly Superhero Films. 

            “Quantumania” also gives Pfeiffer a lot more to do as we, and Hank and Hope, learn a little bit more about Janet’s 30 years in the Quantum Realm and the various compromises and allegiances she made to stay alive. Pfeiffer is an unambiguous delight and the real center of the movie despite what the title might claim. Ant-Man just finds himself in the middle of the mess, which starts to drag on in a muddle of sci-fi furnishings that individually are probably quite inspired and interesting but together just blend into a dreary mess. 

            It’s a shame because Reed’s films are generally so crisp and styled and are best when focused on characters, not worlds and Quantum Realms. “Quantumania” shines when it is keeping things light and quippy. 

            But Kang, for what we can assume are bigger story needs, needs to be more serious. Majors is certainly chilling and captivating, but Kang seems like a mismatched foe for a standalone Ant-Man film and the result is a “Quantumania” that is trying to be too many things. One thing it is not is a Wasp movie, though. Lilly gets a lot to do but not a lot of — or any — character development. 

            “Quantumania” sticks the ending, however. Without giving anything away, we'll just say that Reed and Rudd get to return to their sweet spot, with a bit of a twist.

            “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,” a Walt Disney release in theaters Thursday, is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for “some sci-fi action violence.” Running time: 122 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810360,Winner of California's $2B lottery gets largest U.S. jackpot,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — The winner of the largest U.S. lottery jackpot in history is a former student in the California public school system who wants to mostly stay out of the spotlight.

            California lottery officials on Tuesday said Edwin Castro won the record-breaking $2.04 billion Powerball prize in November. But they couldn't say anything else about him. State law says Castro's name is in the public record, but nothing else is — including his age and where he lives.

            The winning ticket was sold at Joe’s Service Center in Altadena, an unincorporated community in the foothills northeast of Los Angeles. But California Lottery winners aren't required to live in the state to win. Joe Chahayed, the owner of Joe's Service Center, got a $1 million bonus for selling the winning ticket. 











            Castro declined an invitation from state officials to speak to reporters on Tuesday. Instead, he sent a written statement that said he was “shocked and ecstatic” to have won the lottery. California's lottery benefits public schools, and Castro's statement identified himself as “being educated in the California public education system.""

            “It's gratifying to hear that, as a result of my win, the California school system greatly benefits as well,"" he said.

            Winners can choose to receive their winnings over 30 annual payments or as a lump sum. State officials said Castro chose the lump sum of $997.6 million.

            Most people who win big lottery jackpots try to keep a low profile and avoid publicity, California Lottery Deputy Director Carolyn Becker said. But some states like to announce winners publicly to “humanize” the lottery by reminding the public that real people win real prizes.

            The lottery that Castro won was the largest in U.S. history because it took so long or someone to choose the correct combination of six numbers to win the prize. The Powerball jackpot starts at $20 million and increases each time there is no winner. There were more than 40 consecutive drawings before Castro's numbers were called: 10, 33, 41, 47 and 56, plus the red Powerball was 10.

            Becker said all of those drawings raised $156.3 million for California public schools, the most ever from a single jackpot. Altogether, the California Lottery collected $2 billion for public schools in their most recent fiscal year.

            “These numbers represent promises kept since voters created the lottery in 1984 with the explicit purpose and intent to raise supplemental funding for public education,” California Lottery Director Alva Johnson said.

            Castro's win means that three of the 10 largest lottery jackpots in U.S. history have come from tickets sold in California. The second-largest jackpot — $1.586 billion in 2016 — matched three tickets sold in California, Florida and Tennessee. A $699.8 million ticket, good enough for the ninth largest jackpot ever, was sold in California in 2021.

            State officials have Castro's winning ticket. Becker said they're considering putting it on display at the lottery's headquarters.SACRAMENTO, Calif.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810361,"Biden, Yellen warn of 'catastrophe' if debt limit not raised","WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned Tuesday of a potential economic crisis if a deal isn't reached to increase the federal debt ceiling. 

            They raised the alarm during speeches to the National Association of Counties, which was holding a conference in Washington.

            Biden said many local governments have recovered from the pandemic, but ""some in Congress are putting that progress at risk by threatening to have America default on its debt, which would be catastrophic for counties and the country. Even coming close to default would raise borrowing costs, making it harder to finance key projects in your communities.""











            The concern over the debt ceiling is the result of a political showdown between House Republicans, who are demanding spending cuts, and the Democratic president, who insists on raising the limit without conditions. 

            Yellen similarly warned of a “catastrophe” in her own speech. 

            “In the longer term, a default would raise the cost of borrowing into perpetuity. Future investments, including public investments, would become substantially more costly,” she said. 

            “Household payments on mortgages, auto loans, and credit cards would rise, and American businesses would see credit markets deteriorate,"" she said. “On top of that, it is unlikely that the federal government would be able to issue payments to millions of Americans, including our military families and seniors who rely on Social Security.”

            Yellen notified Congress last month that the U.S. Treasury Department has resorted to “extraordinary measures” to avoid default on the nation’s $31.4 trillion borrowing authority. But the extraordinary measures would likely run out — and put the U.S. at risk of default — sometime around early June. 

            In a Jan. 13 letter to House and Senate leaders, Yellen said her actions will buy time until Congress can pass legislation that will either raise or suspend the limit, but she said it’s “critical that Congress act in a timely manner.”

            Her latest comments come ahead of the Congressional Budget Office’s projections to be released Wednesday, which updates the office’s expectation about when Treasury will no longer be able to pay its obligations fully if the debt limit is not raised.

            “Let’s not wait until the last minute,” Yellen said. ”I believe it is a basic responsibility of our nation’s leaders to get this done.”

            Biden and Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy met at the White House this month to discuss the issue. McCarthy told the president he would not raise the debt ceiling without concessions from Democrats.

            “No agreement, no promises except we will continue this conversation,” McCarthy told reporters outside the White House after the meeting. 

            During his State of the Union address last week, Biden chided Republicans over the debt ceiling — suggesting that Republicans want to slash Medicare and Social Security. 

            Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday continued trying to distance his party from those on the GOP’s right flank who have proposed ways to reel in spending on the popular programs. 

            “Let me say one more time: There is no agenda on the part of Senate Republicans to revisit Medicare or Social Security. Period,” McConnell said.

            McConnell did indicate his support for McCarthy’s efforts to negotiate with Biden over spending cuts elsewhere in the federal budget as part of any deal with Congress to vote on raising the debt limit. But he also insisted the debt limit would be raised to avert what could be a fiscally dangerous default.

            “America’s never going to default,” McConnell said.

            Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said it was time for McCarthy to “show us” his plan.

            “He said he wants to make cuts, he has an obligation to show what those cuts are,” Schumer said.

            Schumer said he was doubtful McCarthy would be able to corral his Republican majority in the House behind any plan because of the deep divisions between the hard-right and more traditional conservatives. He said some Republicans still back changes to the Social Security and Medicare programs.

            “He’s going to have a rough time,” Schumer said of the House speaker. “The hard-right people want the deepest kind of cuts.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810362,US proposes removing wood stork from endangered species list,"ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) — The ungainly yet graceful wood stork, which was on the brink of extinction in 1984, has recovered sufficiently in Florida and other Southern states that U.S. wildlife officials on Tuesday proposed removing the wading bird from the endangered species list.

            The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said in a news release that restoration of the wood stork's habitat, especially in the Florida Everglades and adjacent Big Cypress National Preserve, led to a sharp increase in breeding pairs. Those numbers had shrunk to just 5,000 pairs in 1984, whereas there are more than 10,000 pairs today.

            “This iconic species has rebounded because dedicated partners in the southeast have worked tirelessly to restore ecosystems, such as the Everglades, that support it,” said Shannon Estenoz, assistant Interior secretary for fish, wildlife and parks.











            In addition, the wood stork has increased its range in coastal areas of Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and the Carolinas, officials said. The birds have adapted to new nesting areas in those states, tripling the number of colonies across their range from 29 to 99 in recent years.

            Credit goes mainly to the wildlife protections provided by the Endangered Species Act, which marks its 50th anniversary this year, said Stephanie Kurose, a senior policy specialist at environmental group the Center for Biological Diversity. The act can impose restrictions on a variety of activities in areas where such species are located, such as development, mining and oil drilling.

            “The act saved the wood stork and it helped preserve and rebuild vital habitats throughout the southeast, which has improved water quality and benefited countless other species who call the area home,"" Kurose said by email.

            Wood storks have a distinctive scaly, featherless gray head and a bright white feathered body with long skinny legs. They are fairly large, standing up to four feet (1.2 meters) tall and with a wingspan of up to 5 feet (1.5 meters). The nesting pairs lay three to five eggs per year, although the eggs are frequently targeted by predators such as raccoons and other birds.

            Their bald heads give wood storks an almost prehistoric appearance, leading to nicknames such as “stonehead” and “flinthead.” Wood storks feed in shallow waters on fish, insects, frogs and crabs depending on whether it's wet or dry season. They are the only stork native to North America.

            In Florida, federal and state governments are spending tens of billions of dollars for ongoing projects to restore natural water flows in the Everglades and Big Cypress and reduce harmful nutrients from fertilizer runoff and other sources that promote unhealthy plant growth.

            The Endangered Species Act has saved 99% of the species that have been on the list since 1973, with 100 types of plants and animals delisted because they have recovered or are at least stable, according to the Interior Department.

            “The proposed delisting of the wood stork is a significant milestone and a testament to the hard work by federal agencies, state and local governments, tribes, conservation organizations, and private citizens in protecting and restoring our most at-risk species,” Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said.

            The Fish and Wildlife Service will take comments on the proposal through April 17 from other government agencies, scientists, environmental groups and anyone else interested in the welfare of the wood stork. After that, the service will publish a final decision on whether to remove the bird from the endangered species list.

            If the wood stork is delisted, officials said it would remain protected by other laws including the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Clean Water Act. A monitoring plan would be put in place for at least five years to ensure the stork population remains stable.ST. PETERSBURG, Fla.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810363,Murphy says New Jersey will expand AP Black history classes,"TRENTON, N.J. (AP) — Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy said Tuesday that his administration is expanding Advanced Placement African American Studies courses next year from one school to 26 in New Jersey after Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis blocked the course from being taught in public schools in Florida. 

            Murphy's move comes about a month after the administration of DeSantis, a potential presidential candidate, declared without citing any evidence that the course violates state law and isn't historically accurate. 

            Murphy cited Florida as he unveiled the course expansion Tuesday during a visit to a Newark high school alongside state education officials and Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, saying DeSantis is prioritizing “political culture wars” over academics. 











            ""New Jersey will proudly teach our kids that Black History is American History,"" Murphy said in a statement. “While the DeSantis Administration stated that AP African American Studies ‘significantly lacks educational value’, New Jersey will stand on the side of teaching our full history.” 

            A message seeking comment was left with DeSantis' spokespeople. 

            The courses have begun in 60 schools nationwide as part of a two-year pilot phase and are set to expand to hundreds next year. 

            Florida's move stirred a debate over the courses. 

            DeSantis said the course seeks to push an agenda and violates the Stop WOKE Act he signed last year, which prohibits instruction that defines people as necessarily oppressed or privileged based on their race.

            Critics say DeSantis is sending a message that Black history doesn't count in Florida. 

            The College Board, which administers the Advanced Placement program, released course curriculum details this month, which show that topics including Black Lives Matter, slavery reparations and queer life are not part of the course's exam, but are still included as potential research topics, along with “Black conservatism.” The board said course revisions were mostly complete before DeSantis objected.

            Newark Schools Superintendent Roger Leon embraced the expansion. Six schools in his district will teach the course in the 2023-2024 school year. 

            “The study of African American History, as a discrete field, is important to gaining a deeper, fuller understanding of United States History,"" Leon said. 

            New Jersey's statewide learning standards already required some diversity education in lessons, requirements that were expanded in 2021 under a state law requiring districts to incorporate instruction on diversity and inclusion.

            Murphy also targeted DeSantis during his January state of the state address, criticizing his comments that Florida is where “woke goes to die.”

            As for Murphy's own presidential ambitions, he has said he'll back President Joe Biden if he runs for reelection, leaving open the possibility he could consider running if not.TRENTON, N.J. (AP) — Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy said Tuesday that his administration is expanding Advanced Placement African American Studies courses next year from one school to 26 in New Jersey after Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis blocked the course from being taught in public schools in Florida.Murphy's move comes about a month after the administration of DeSantis, a potential presidential candidate, declared without citing any evidence that the course violates state law and isn't historically accurate.Murphy cited Florida as he unveiled the course expansion Tuesday during a visit to a Newark high school alongside state education officials and Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, saying DeSantis is prioritizing “political culture wars” over academics.""New Jersey will proudly teach our kids that Black History is American History,"" Murphy said in a statement. “While the DeSantis Administration stated that AP African American Studies ‘significantly lacks educational value’, New Jersey will stand on the side of teaching our full history.”A message seeking comment was left with DeSantis' spokespeople.The courses have begun in 60 schools nationwide as part of a two-year pilot phase and are set to expand to hundreds next year.Florida's move stirred a debate over the courses.DeSantis said the course seeks to push an agenda and violates the Stop WOKE Act he signed last year, which prohibits instruction that defines people as necessarily oppressed or privileged based on their race.Critics say DeSantis is sending a message that Black history doesn't count in Florida.The College Board, which administers the Advanced Placement program, released course curriculum details this month, which show that topics including Black Lives Matter, slavery reparations and queer life are not part of the course's exam, but are still included as potential research topics, along with “Black conservatism.” The board said course revisions were mostly complete before DeSantis objected.Newark Schools Superintendent Roger Leon embraced the expansion.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810364,Fans barred from European soccer game amid Russian plot fear,"NYON, Switzerland (AP) — A European soccer game in Moldova will be played in an empty stadium on Thursday amid concerns about alleged Russian-backed attempts to overthrow the national government.

            UEFA said Tuesday no fans will be allowed in the stadium when Sheriff hosts Serbian club Partizan in the first leg of a Europa Conference League knockout playoff.

            The behind-closed-doors order was “due to the decision of the authorities in Moldova,” UEFA said in a statement.











            It came one day after the president of Moldova, Maia Sandu, described an alleged Russian plot against her country’s government using external saboteurs.

            Moldova, a former Soviet republic of about 2.6 million people, has sought to build stronger ties with the European Union since its neighbor Ukraine was invaded by Russia one year ago.

            Serbia is a traditional ally of Russia and fans of Partizan from Belgrade were expected at the game in the Moldovan capital Chisinau.

            Sheriff is from Tiraspol in the separatist region of Transnistria and its games in UEFA competitions have already subject to a political decision this season because of the war.

            UEFA required Sheriff to play home games away from Tiraspol, which is about 90 kilometers (55 miles) from the Ukrainian city of Odesa.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810365,"Chiefs revel in Super Bowl win, then get into offseason work","KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — Andy Reid isn't done yet. Patrick Mahomes isn't going anywhere, either.

            Chad Henne is heading off in retirement but otherwise the Kansas City Chiefs have very few holes to address heading into the offseason, which is why they already have been tabbed the favorites to defend their Super Bowl title next year.

            It's also bringing up the subject of dynasty.











            The Chiefs are the first franchise to host five consecutive championship games, winning the AFC three times and now twice hoisting the Lombardi Trophy. Their latest performance may have been their best: They played a near-perfect second half Sunday night to rally from a 10-point deficit for a 38-35 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles.

            “I'm not going to say dynasty yet,” Mahomes said, but only because, “we're not done.”

            As the Chiefs enjoy a parade through downtown Kansas City on Wednesday, then head into the offseason, here are some of the biggest decisions that general manager Brett Veach and Reid are facing:

            FRANCHISE TACKLE

            The Chiefs tried last offseason to reach an agreement with left tackle Orlando Brown Jr. on a long-term deal, and he wound up playing this season on the franchise tag for about $16.6 million. Brown was excellent most of the season, too, posting a pass-block win rate of nearly 92% while helping Mahomes set a career high for yards passing.

            The Chiefs will try to get that long-term deal done this offseason, but the pressure is squarely on their side of the ledger, because while the option of tagging Brown a second time exists, it would be prohibitively expensive.

            “I was brought here to win championships and year after year that’s the plan,” Brown said. ""I’m so blessed and so fortunate to have the opportunity to do these things with this group of men. It’s what I was brought here for, to win championships.”

            OTHER FREE AGENTS

            The Chiefs gave wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster what amounted to a one-year prove-it deal worth a paltry $3.76 million for this season, and he massively outplayed it. Smith-Schuster would like to remain in Kansas City, and the Chiefs would prefer not to completely rebuild their wide receiver corps, but his play this season likely warrants a significant deal.

            “I’m not the type of guy who cares about stats, catches, who gets the ball or whatnot,” Smith-Schuster said. ""All I care about is winning and when you win everyone is so happy.”

            Defensive tackles Derrick Nnadi and Khalen Saunders, running back Jerick McKinnon, wide receiver Mecole Hardman, right tackle Andrew Wylie and safety Juan Thornhill also are free agents. The Chiefs have some tough decisions to make when it comes to pursing any of them, but don't be surprised to see a couple take club-friendly deals to keep winning.

            KEEPING OTHERS HAPPY

            Chris Jones, a finalist for defensive MVP, has one year left on his four-year, $80 million contract, and the Chiefs would be wise to begin negotiating a deal now. Jones piled up 15 1/2 sacks this season to match the best year of his career, and he had two more sacks in the AFC title game, before helping put just enough pressure on Jalen Hurts in the Super Bowl.

            Versatile cornerback L'Jarius Sneed and linebacker Willie Gay Jr. also have one year left on their rookie deals, and the Chiefs would like to keep both of them around if the price is right. Both have become staples in the defense.

            COME ON DOWN

            The Chiefs are hosting the NFL draft for the first time in April and they'll be hard-pressed to fare better than they did last year. They added long-term starters in cornerback Trent McDuffie and defensive end George Karlaftis, and role players in wide receiver Skyy Moore, linebacker Leo Chenal and defensive backs Jaylen Watson, Josh Williams and Bryan Cook.

            Their first pick is No. 31 with additional selections in the second and third rounds. They have two fourth-round picks thanks to their trade last year of Tyreek Hill along with one in the fifth, one in the sixth and two in the seventh.

            The Chiefs could use more help at wide receiver, regardless of whether Smith-Schuster signs elsewhere. They also could use another offensive tackle given Brown's contract status and with Wylie becoming a free agent.

            AS FOR COACH

            There were reports surfacing before the Super Bowl that the 64-year-old Reid, now a two-time champion, would contemplate retiring after the game. But he wasted no time brushing them off.

            “I look in the mirror and I’m old. My heart, though, is young,"" he said. ""I’m good with what I’m doing right now.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810366,US arrests 4 tied to assassination of Haitian president,"MIAMI (AP) — U.S. authorities have arrested four more people in the slaying of Haitian President Jovenel Moïse, including the owner of a Miami-area security company that hired ex-Colombian soldiers for the mission, prosecutors announced Tuesday.

            The squad of former Colombian soldiers are among dozens of suspects who carried out the July 2021 attack that authorities say originally was envisioned to be a coup rather than an assassination. The plotters had hoped to reap lucrative contracts under a new administration once Moïse was out of the way, investigators allege.

            “This was both a human tragedy and an assault on core democratic principles,” said Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew G. Olsen.











            Antonio “Tony” Intriago, 59, a Venezuelan-American who owned CTU Security that hired the Colombians, is charged with conspiracy to kill or kidnap a person outside the U.S. among other charges. CTU company representative Arcangel Pretel Ortiz, 50, a Colombian-born resident of the U.S., faces the same charges. 

            Florida-based U.S. financier Walter Veintemilla, 54, of Weston, Fla., is accused of funding the operation. A fourth suspect, Frederick Joseph Bergmann Jr., 64, of Tampa, is accused of smuggling goods including 20 CTU-branded ballistic vests disguised as medical X-ray vests and school supplies.

            Intriago was known among plotters as “The General” and Pretel as “Colonel Gabriel,” according to authorities.

            Tama Kudman, Veintemilla's attorney, told The Associated Press that he would plead not guilty to both charges.

            Claude Joseph, who was serving as prime minister when Moïse was killed, cheered the announcement. “Justice must prevail,” he tweeted.

            A total of 11 suspects are now in U.S. custody, including key players like James Solages and Joseph Vincent, two Haitian-Americans who were among the first arrested after Moïse was shot 12 times at his private home in July 2021. Other suspects include Christian Emmanuel Sanon, a pastor and failed businessman whose associates have suggested was duped by the plotters.

            A power vacuum following the assassination has allowed gangs in Haiti to gain more power and control more territory, with experts estimating that they control 60% of Port-au-Prince. A spike in kidnappings, rapes and killings have prompted Prime Minister Ariel Henry to demand the immediate deployment of foreign troops. But the request in October has gone unheeded by the U.N. Security Council, which has opted to implement sanctions so far.

            Federal authorities said that in April 2021, Veintemilla’s company, Worldwide Capital Lending Group, provided CTU with a $175,000 line of credit.

            “By that time, the men planned to foment a public uprising aimed at ousting President Moise and installing Sanon as president,” charging documents say.

            Authorities said that Intriago, Ortiz and Veintemilla expected to “reap significant financial benefits” if Sanon became president via anticipated contracts for infrastructure, military equipment and the provision of security forces.

            Also in April, Ortiz and others met with the FBI and unsuccessfully tried to draw them into “a discussion about regime change in Haiti.” 

            Around that time, Ortiz told Solages that “the current president is the thief...delete the messages that could compromise you in case of being captured.” Ortiz also sent a text message to another suspect, Colombian citizen Germán Rivera García, with a photo of a whiteboard sketch of an assault plan including “snipers” and “10 warrior-neutralizers,"" according to court documents.

            The suspects had used coded language like “screws” and “nails” for ammunition and “tools” or “instruments” for firearms, with Veintemilla providing $15,000 to Solages to buy ammunition and $250,000 for armored vests, authorities said.

            Authorities have said that the original plan was to detain Moïse, force him onto a plane and whisk him to an unidentified location, but that plot crumbled when suspects couldn’t find a plane or sufficient weapons, according to court documents.

            Sanon, who envisioned himself as Haiti's new leader, was supposed to seize power, but some suspects soon favored a former Haitian Supreme Court judge to take over instead. Ortiz, Intriago, Veintemilla and others realized that “Sanon had neither the constitutional qualifications nor the popular support of the Haitian people to become president,"" according to court documents.

            Police say the judge remains a fugitive.

            A day before the killing, Solages falsely told other suspects that it was a CIA operation and that the real mission was to kill the president. Shortly before Moïse was killed, Solages yelled that it was supposedly a DEA operation so that the president’s security detail would comply.

            Also detained are former Haitian Sen. John Joël Joseph, who had fled to Jamaica, and former U.S. government informant and Haitian businessman Rodolphe Jaar, who was extradited from the Dominican Republic.

            As the U.S. investigation pushes forward, the probe in Haiti is nearly idle. Three judges have stepped down from the case amid fears of reprisals and a fourth one was dismissed. Meanwhile, no court hearings have been held yet for the more than 40 suspects arrested in Haiti, with many of them including 18 Colombian soldiers languishing in a severely overcrowded jail in Port-au-Prince that often lacks food and water.

            The situation has angered and frustrated the president's widow, Martine Moïse, who lashed out in a 13-minute video she posted earlier this month, noting that things have worsened in Haiti since the assassination.

            “It's a huge crime that happened against the nation,” she said. “Where is the mother law of the country, where are the people, where is the democracy?”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810368,Man who used stun gun on cop in Jan. 6 riot pleads guilty,"A California man pleaded guilty on Tuesday to using a stun gun to attack a Washington, D.C., police officer who was brutally injured while trying to defend the U.S. Capitol from the angry mob of President Donald Trump's supporters on Jan. 6, 2021. 

            Daniel Rodriguez, 40, of Fontana, admitted to taking part in the violent assault on former Metropolitan Police Officer Michael Fanone after another rioter dragged the officer into the crowd outside the tunnel where police were trying to beat back the mob. Fanone, who at one point lost consciousness and suffered a heart attack, was heard on camera screaming that he has kids in a desperate appeal for his life as other rioters beat him. 

            Rodriguez's guilty plea comes about two weeks before jury selection was supposed to begin in his trial in Washington's federal court. He pleaded guilty in Washington's federal court to four felony charges including conspiracy and assaulting a law enforcement officer with a deadly or dangerous weapon. 











            An email seeking comment was sent to his lawyers on Tuesday. He's scheduled to be sentenced in May. Federal sentencing guidelines call for about seven to 10 years in prison, according to court papers. 

            Rodriguez admitted in an interview with FBI agents after his arrest in March 2021 that he drove a stun gun into Fanone's neck. Rodriguez told agents that he had believed that he was doing the “right thing” on Jan. 6 and that he had been prepared to die to “save the country.” He cried as he spoke to the agents, saying he was “stupid” and ashamed by his actions. 

            Rodriguez's attorneys had tried unsuccessfully to block prosecutors from using his FBI interview at trial, arguing that the agents used “psychologically coercive tactics"" to get him to talk. 

            Authorities say Rodriguez and others were part of a Telegram group chat called “PATRIOTS 45 MAGA Gang"" in the run-up to Jan. 6 in which they advocated violence and discussed what they viewed as a stolen election. In one post on Dec. 29, 2020, Rodriguez wrote in the chat: “Congress can hang. I’ll do it. Please let us get these people dear God,"" according to charging papers. 

            At the Capitol, Rodriguez was part of the mob that pushed into the tunnel where officers were trying to fend off the rioters, prosecutors said. Inside the tunnel, another rioter handed him the stun gun that he would later apply to the back of Fanone's neck, according to court papers. After assaulting Fanone, Rodriguez entered the Capitol through a broken window. Later, he texted his friends: “Tazzed the (expletive) out of the blue,"" they said. 

            Others charged with assaulting Fanone include Albuquerque Cosper Head, who wrapped his arms around Fanone’s neck and dragged him into the crowd outside the tunnel. Head restrained Fanone while other rioters attacked him. Head was sentenced in October to more than seven years in prison after pleading guilty to an assault charge.

            Fanone said at Head’s sentencing that he suffered a heart attack and a traumatic brain injury and that his injuries ultimately cost him his career. He has written a book about his Jan. 6 experience and testified at a hearing held by the House committee investigating the insurrection.

            Another man, Kyle Young, who helped in the sustained assault on the officer, was sentenced in September to seven years and two months in prison. Young grabbed the officer by the wrist while others yelled, “Kill him!” and “Get his gun!” 

            They are among the longest sentences that have been handed down so far in the riot. 

            Nearly 1,000 people have been charged with federal crimes related to the Jan. 6 riot. More than 500 of them have pleaded guilty, mostly to misdemeanors. Approximately 400 have been sentenced, with over half getting terms of imprisonment ranging from seven days to 10 years.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810369,Amazon unit Zoox tests robotaxi on California city's streets,"NEW YORK (AP) — Zoox, a self-driving vehicle company owned by Amazon, says it has successfully carried passengers on public roads — a development that helps the California company inch closer to bringing the vehicle to the general public. 

            The company conducted the first run of its four-person “robotaxi” with employees on board Saturday, the Amazon subsidiary said Monday. 

            The vehicle, which doesn’t have a steering wheel or pedals, ran a mile-long (1.6-kilometer) route between two Zoox buildings at the company’s headquarters in Foster City, California. The carriage-style interior of the vehicle has two benches that face each other. It measures just under 12 feet (3.7 meters) long, about a foot (a third of a meter) shorter than a standard Mini Cooper and can travel up to 35 miles per hour (56 kph). 











            Zoox, which was founded in 2014 and bought by Seattle-based Amazon six years later, says its vehicle can navigate roads and avoid collisions. Before Saturday's test, the company said it completed testing on private roads and got necessary approvals from California’s Department of Motor Vehicles. 

            With the test now completed, Zoox says its planning to launch a shuttle service exclusively for its employees.NEW YORK (AP) — Zoox, a self-driving vehicle company owned by Amazon, says it has successfully carried passengers on public roads — a development that helps the California company inch closer to bringing the vehicle to the general public.The company conducted the first run of its four-person “robotaxi” with employees on board Saturday, the Amazon subsidiary said Monday.The vehicle, which doesn’t have a steering wheel or pedals, ran a mile-long (1.6-kilometer) route between two Zoox buildings at the company’s headquarters in Foster City, California.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810370,Column: Bringing together the best should include the rest,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Tiger Woods is back among the modern stars in the game, this time with his golf clubs, still wearing more than one hat.

            He is a player at the Genesis Invitational. It already has the strongest field of the year, but Woods brings a buzz that only he can generate. Never mind that he has never won at Riviera even when Woods was at the zenith of his game.

            When he plays, everyone watches.











            Woods also is the tournament host who hands out the trophy. For so many players who grew up idolizing him — which is practically all of them — it can make winning feel even greater than the $3.6 million payoff. “Tiger Woods is handing us a trophy — that's a pretty crazy thought,” Max Homa said when he won two years ago.

            Equally important is the voice Woods brings to the private meetings, like the one scheduled for Tuesday afternoon at Riviera, as the leading players try to map out the best way forward for the PGA Tour amid the Saudi-funded threat of LIV Golf.

            Woods last showed up at an “actual PGA Tour event” — his words when he announced on Twitter he was playing at Riviera — last August in Delaware. He flew up to lead the first such meeting when the main objective was to bring golf's best together more often. The next step is deciding how elite these tournaments should be, not just prize money but how many players get to compete.

            If he speaks from experience — and no one can like Woods — he would do well to mention a few names that illustrate what makes golf the ultimate meritocracy.

            Bob May.

            He was the journeyman from California who challenged Woods like no one else could in the summer of 2000. May was leading the PGA Championship by one shot with two to play until Woods birdied the last two holes and beat him in a three-hole playoff. Woods said then it was “probably one of the greatest duels I've ever had in my life.”

            Grant Waite.

            The Kiwi with one PGA Tour victory and a world ranking of No. 242 matched Woods shot for shot on the back nine in the 2000 Canadian Open. Waite trailed by one when he hit 5-iron to 40 feet for an eagle attempt on Glen Abbey's par-5 closing hole. That forced Woods to play boldly, and he did. In one of the more famous shots of a career filled with them, Woods hit 6-iron from 218 yards out of a fairway bunker, over the water and right at the flag to set up a two-putt birdie and another win.

            Rocco Mediate.

            He had to go through 36-hole qualifying just to get to Torrey Pines for the 2008 U.S. Open. A five-time winner, Mediate was 45 and ranked No. 157 in the world. And then he pushed Woods to the limits, rallying from two behind in the final round to force a playoff. Mediate dressed in black pants and a red shirt — no one else is that audacious — and Woods had to go 19 holes to beat him.

            There were plenty of other occasions where Woods battled the best — Ernie Els at Kapalua and Disney (yes, Disney), Phil Mickelson at Doral and Bay Hill, Vijay Singh at The Players Championship, David Duval at the Masters.

            Those were the best.

            But it was the rest who provided theater just as great, all because they had a tee time. That's all anyone needs. And even as the PGA Tour works toward an elite league, it would do well to remember that.

            Having a 36-hole cut is imperative, no matter the size of the field. Otherwise, it becomes nothing more than a World Golf Championship series that grew stale. Even the best have to prove themselves every week. That's what sets golf apart.

            No matter the size of the field for the elevated events in 2024 and beyond — 70 seems like a base number, and it could go higher — there has to be room for players to earn a shot at the best.

            Look what's happened just two months into a dynamic year.

            Jon Rahm won The American Express after a great battle on the back nine in the California desert with PGA Tour rookie Davis Thompson. A week later, Sam Ryder was on the verge of a wire-to-wire victory until the rough ate up his tee shot on the 15th and Homa delivered a brilliant birdie ahead of him to cap off a five-shot rally.

            The most recent example was the WM Phoenix Open, where Scottie Scheffler defended his title and returned to No. 1 in the world. He battled over the weekend against Rahm and Xander Schauffele, with Jordan Spieth lurking. The one player who never went away was Nick Taylor, who stayed with him until the final few holes.

            It was just three years ago that Taylor faced Mickelson in the final group at Pebble Beach with a one-shot lead as Lefty was going for a sixth title at Pebble. Instead, Taylor put five shots between them at the turn and won going away.

            This is nothing new, of course.

            Think back to 1913. The U.S. Open was delayed until September to accommodate British stalwarts Harry Vardon and Ted Ray, who were barnstorming across America for a series of golf exhibitions. When they got to Brookline, 20-year-old amateur Francis Ouimet beat them in a playoff in a U.S. Open that put golf on the front pages.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810371,SEC implements new rules to speed up league baseball games,"BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) — The Southeastern Conference is implementing new rules in an effort to speed up league games.

            The SEC will put batters and pitchers on a 30-second timer after the conclusion of each play. The batter must be in the box and ready at the 10-second mark and the pitcher has to begin his motion before the 30 seconds expire.

            The rules apply only to SEC games, which start in March, and include the league tournament. 











            Coaches also will be placed on a 30-second timer for mound visits, starting when the coach leaves the dugout or a defensive player leaves his position to walk to the mound. After that, the NCAA's 20-second pitch clock will start.

            Visits that include a doctor or trainer evaluating a potential medical issue won't have to abide by the 30-second clock.

            New pitchers coming into the game either at the start of an inning or mid-inning have two minutes and 30 seconds after leaving the bullpen. Then the 20-second pitch clock starts. 

            SEC games will also now operate with a 10-run mercy rule that takes effect after the seventh inning.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810386,"Lawyer: Pamela Smart, serving life sentence, asks for hope","CONCORD, N.H. (AP) — A lawyer for Pamela Smart, who is serving a life-without-parole sentence for plotting with her teenage lover to kill her husband in 1990, argued Tuesday that a state council “brushed aside"" her request for a chance at freedom, and asked New Hampshire's highest court to order the panel to reconsider it. 

            Smart's longtime attorney, Mark Sisti, argued the five-member council did not spend any time poring over Smart's voluminous petition — which included many letters of support from inmates, supervisors and others — or even discuss it before rejecting her sentence reduction request in less than three minutes in March. 

            “I'm asking the only place I can go — the only place Pam can go — to say ‘Just Do Your Job,'"" Sisti said.











            Associate Justice James Bassett asked “And what does that mean? What are we going to say?” 

            To which Sisti replied: “A meaningful, minimal due process hearing that we even get at the Department of Motor Vehicles.""

            Last year was the third time that Smart, who has served over 30 years in prison, had asked the Executive Council for a hearing. Now 55, she has exhausted all of her judicial appeal options and has to go through the council for a sentence change. Previous petitions were rejected in 2005 and in 2019. 

            Smart was 22 and working as a high school media coordinator when she began an affair with a 15-year-old student who later shot and killed her husband, Gregory Smart, in 1990. Though she denied knowledge of the plot, she was convicted of conspiracy to commit murder and other crimes and sentenced to life without parole. 

            The teen, William Flynn, and three other teens, cooperated with prosecutors, served shorter sentences and have been released.

            The trial was a media circus and one of the first high-profile cases about a sexual affair between a school staff member and a student. Joyce Maynard wrote “To Die For” in 1992, drawing from the Smart case. That inspired a 1995 film of the same name, starring Nicole Kidman and Joaquin Phoenix.

            The attorney general's office opposed Smart's commutation requests, saying she has never accepted full responsibility for the crimes. 

            Laura Lombardi, senior assistant attorney general, argued Tuesday that Smart “has no protectable constitutional interest in receiving commutation of her sentence"" and that the case should not be before the court. 

            “This is a matter of mercy and grace, held by the executive branch,"" she said.

             Gov. Chris Sununu had the option of putting the commutation request on the council's agenda, and did so, she said. She said there is no requirement for the governor and council to create rules regarding the process. 

            Sisti said a life-without-parole sentence should hitch onto something: hope. 

            “I'm asking that you give Pam Smart that little inkling, that little crack in the door where she can have hope,"" he said. 

            In addition to earning two master’s degrees in a Bedford Hills, New York, prison, Smart has tutored fellow inmates, has been ordained as a minister and is part of an inmate liaison committee. In her last petition, she said she is remorseful and and has been rehabilitated. She apologized to Gregory Smart's family.CONCORD, N.H.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810388,"Russian businessman guilty in hacking, insider trade scheme","BOSTON (AP) — A Russian millionaire with ties to the Kremlin was convicted Tuesday of participating in an elaborate $90 million insider trading scheme using secret earnings information from companies such as Microsoft that was stolen from U.S. computer networks. 

            Vladislav Klyushin, 42, who ran a Moscow-based information technology company associated with the Russian government, was found guilty on all charges against him, including wire fraud and securities fraud, after a two-week trial in federal court in Boston.

            “The jury saw Mr. Klyushin for exactly what he is — a cybercriminal and a cheat. He repeatedly gamed the system and finally got caught. Now he is a convicted felon. For nearly three years, he and his co-conspirators repeatedly hacked into U.S. computer networks to obtain tomorrow’s headlines today,” Massachusetts U.S. Attorney Rachael Rollins said in an email statement. 











            Klyushin was arrested in 2021 in Switzerland after he arrived on a private jet and just before he and his party were about to board a helicopter to whisk them to a nearby ski resort. Four alleged co-conspirators — including a Russian military intelligence officer who’s also been charged with meddling in the 2016 presidential election — remain at large. 

            Klyushin’s attorney, Maksim Nemtsev, said in an email that he and his client are disappointed but respect the jury’s verdict. He said they intend to appeal, adding that the case included “novel theories” that have never before been reviewed or adopted by higher courts. 

            Klyushin was owner of a Moscow-based information technology company that purported to provide services to detect vulnerabilities in computer systems. It counted among its clients the administration of Russian President Vladimir Putin and other government entities, according to prosecutors. 

            Klyushin was also close friends with a Russian military officer who was among 12 Russians charged in 2018 with hacking into key Democratic Party email accounts, including those belonging to Hilary Clinton's presidential campaign chairman, John Podesta, the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Ivan Ermakov, who worked for Klyushin's company, was a hacker in the alleged insider trading scheme, alleged prosecutors. They haven't alleged that Klyushin was involved in the election interference.

            Prosecutors say hackers stole employees’ usernames and passwords for two U.S.-based vendors that publicly traded companies use to make filings through the Securities and Exchange Commission. They then broke into the vendors’ computer systems to get financial disclosures for hundreds of companies — including Microsoft, Tesla and Kohls, Ulta Beauty and Sketchers — before the were filed to the SEC and became public, prosecutors said. Many of the earnings reports were downloaded via a computer server located in Boston, according to prosecutors. 

            Armed with this insider information, they were able to cheat the stock market, alleged prosecutors, who said Klyushin personally turned a $2 million investment into nearly $21 million, and altogether, the group turned about $9 million into nearly $90 million. 

            Klyushin’s attorney denied that his client was involved in the scheme, telling jurors in his opening statement that the government’s case was filled with “gaping holes” and “inferences.”BOSTON (AP) — A Russian millionaire with ties to the Kremlin was convicted Tuesday of participating in an elaborate $90 million insider trading scheme using secret earnings information from companies such as Microsoft that was stolen from U.S. computer networks.Vladislav Klyushin, 42, who ran a Moscow-based information technology company associated with the Russian government, was found guilty on all charges against him, including wire fraud and securities fraud, after a two-week trial in federal court in Boston.“The jury saw Mr. Klyushin for exactly what he is — a cybercriminal and a cheat.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810389,"Mike Bobo returns to run Georgia offense, Monken goes to NFL","Mike Bobo reclaimed the offensive coordinator job at Georgia on Tuesday, with Todd Monken leaving the two-time defending national champions for the NFL.

            Bobo, a former Bulldogs quarterback and longtime assistant coach at his alma mater, also served as offensive coordinator under former coach Mark Richt.

            The 48-year-old Bobo has some big shoes to fill. Monken accepted the offensive coordinator job with the Baltimore Ravens after serving on a staff that guided Georgia to back-to-back national titles.











            The Bulldogs averaged 38.6 points per game in 2021 and 41.1 this past season while finishing 15-0, capped by a record-breaking 65-7 blowout of TCU in the national championship game.

            Monken's three-season stint with the Bulldogs will be remembered for the stunning rise of quarterback Stetson Bennett from walk-on to Heisman Trophy finalist.

            “We are extremely thankful and appreciative of the three years Todd and his wife, Terri, have spent with our UGA family,” Georgia coach Kirby Smart said in a statement. “We wish them the best as he moves on to the Ravens organization.”

            Bobo, who had head coaching stints at Colorado State and South Carolina after leaving Georgia following the 2014 season, returned to his alma mater a year ago as a quality control analyst for the offense.

            “Mike was an excellent addition to our staff last year as an analyst, and we are looking forward to his expanded leadership on the offensive side of the ball,” Smart said.

            Bobo takes over an offense with some major holes to fill, most notably at quarterback with Bennett's departure. Carson Beck, who got limited playing time the last two years as a backup, is expected to take over the job. But he'll have to beat out Brock Vandagriff, one of the top-rated QBs in the 2021 recruiting class, and Gunner Stockton, another touted prospect who has yet to play at the college level.

            Whoever wins the job, the focus will be on Bobo to produce the same sort of development that Monken got from Bennett.

            Smart said he's confident that Bobo can handle the role. The two were teammates at Georgia in the 1990s and coached together in 2005 when Smart was an assistant on Richt's staff.

            Bobo worked under Richt for 14 seasons, starting out as the quarterback coach before his promotion to offensive coordinator, a tenure that included two SEC titles. 

            At Colorado State, Bobo's team went 7-6 and played in a bowl game each of his first three seasons, but he was let go in 2019 after the Rams slumped to 7-17 over his final two years. He then returned to the Southeastern Conference, joining Will Muschamp's staff as offensive coordinator for the 2020 season. When Muschamp was fired with three games left in the campaign, Bobo took over as interim coach. The Gamecocks lost all three contests to finish 2-8.

            Bobo moved to Auburn in 2021 to serve as offensive coordinator for new coach Bryan Harsin, only to be fired after a four-overtime loss to Alabama in the regular-season finale; Harsin lasted less than two seasons. 

            Smart pointed to Bobo having a “decade of experience as a successful SEC play-caller and over 20 years spent at UGA, both as a player and coach.”

            Georgia averaged 458.6 yards and 41.3 points per game in the final year of Bobo's previous stint as offensive coordinator. The Bulldogs will be looking to get that same sort of production in 2023 as they go for a third straight national title.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810396,Court overturns ban against former Haitian soccer president,"LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) — A lifetime ban against former Haitian soccer federation president Yves Jean-Bart over allegations he sexually abused female players was overturned Tuesday by the Court of Arbitration for Sport.

            The court upheld Jean-Bart's appeal after noting “inconsistencies and inaccuracies in the statements of the victims and witnesses presented by FIFA.""

            A FIFA ethics committee in November 2020 had found Jean-Bart guilty of having “abused his position and sexually harassed and abused various female players, including minors” over several years.











            The 75-year-old Jean-Bart had also been fined 1 million Swiss francs ($1.1 million).

            Jean-Bart had denied the allegations, which involved national team players, including minors.

            The CAS ruling said information submitted by third parties including Human Rights Watch and world players’ union FIFPro was not “sufficiently evidentiary.”

            “In conclusion, the Panel of Arbitrators considers that the evidence against Yves Jean-Bart regarding the allegations of sexual abuse is inconsistent, unclear and contradictory and that, as a result, it is not sufficient to establish a violation of (FIFA's ethics code),” the CAS ruling said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810397,US officials point to Russia using Iranian drones in Ukraine,"LONDON (AP) — American defense officials on Tuesday sought to dispel any doubt that Iran is supplying drones for Russia’s war in Ukraine, releasing photos and analysis of unmanned aircraft deployed in the conflict to demonstrate Tehran’s involvement.

            During a briefing in London, analysts from the Defense Intelligence Agency displayed photos of drones that attacked Ukraine alongside images of those previously traced to Iran. A comparison of design details such as tail fins, nose cones and landing gear shows that the weapons used in Ukraine are “indistinguishable” from Shahed-131 and -136 attack drones and Mohajer 6 unmanned aerial vehicles used in the Middle East.

            The effort to “show the homework’’ is intended to help persuade governments or international agencies of Tehran’s involvement. Iran has said it supplied a “small number” of drones to Russia before the invasion of Ukraine but has denied providing any more since troops crossed the border last February.











            The evidence proves otherwise, an official from the Defense Intelligence Agency said while speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the information. 

            “Iran is a partner in the conflict with Russia,’’ the official said.

            U.S. officials also suggested that Iran was gleaning valuable information by deploying its technology in Ukraine, including how the drones perform in different weather conditions, seeing how they can be used under different scenarios and getting real life feedback that allows them to make the weapons more effective.

            For example, after learning that civilians were able to flee because they could hear the drones approaching, weapons designers are likely to make future models quieter, the official said.

            “They are getting to see it used on a mass level,’’ the official said. “It’s a process for them. Iran is able to see this feedback and make adjustments.’’

            The war in Ukraine also allows Iran to demonstrate the capabilities of its technology to other potential buyers.

            “Iran sees this as a great marketing opportunity,’’ the official added.

            The analysis was released a day after Britain presented evidence that Iran is supplying advanced weapons to the Houthi rebels in Yemen. 

            Britain presented drones and missiles seized from vessels in the Gulf of Oman to the United Nations as evidence that Iran is violating Security Council resolutions barring weapons shipments to the Houthis.

            The timing of the release suggests Western powers are hardening their stance on Iran, said Tobias Borck, a research fellow for Middle East security studies at the Royal United Services Institute. 

            For the last 20 years, Iran policy has been focused on limiting Iran’s nuclear program. But efforts to resuscitate talks on a nuclear deal are stalled, and officials in Washington, London and Brussels have begun to shift their messaging. 

            The idea that an agreement could be a confidence building measure paving the way to resolving other issues in the region is vanishing.

            “We’re headed in a direction where the West writ large, the U.S. and Europe, will identify Iran as a bad actor,″ Borck said. “And the focus has to be on deterring and containing. And so that’s where the policy is headed.”LONDON (AP) — American defense officials on Tuesday sought to dispel any doubt that Iran is supplying drones for Russia’s war in Ukraine, releasing photos and analysis of unmanned aircraft deployed in the conflict to demonstrate Tehran’s involvement.During a briefing in London, analysts from the Defense Intelligence Agency displayed photos of drones that attacked Ukraine alongside images of those previously traced to Iran.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810398,China praises 'solidarity' with Iran during Raisi visit,"Chinese leader Xi Jinping lavished praise on Iran Monday, as Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi began his three-day visit to China.The meeting in Beijing comes as both Iran and China face increasingly strained ties with Western governments and is the first state visit by an Iranian president to China in more than 20 years.""In the face of the current complex changes in the world, times, and history, China and Iran have supported each other (and) worked together in solidarity and cooperation,"" Xi said in remarks cited by Chinese state-run news outlet CCTV.According to Iran's state-owned Islamic Republic News Agency, Raisi described ""Iran and China as two friends in hard times.""Raisi's three-day visit to China comes as both countries have been condemned and sanctioned by the West on various issues.Western countries such as the US and Germany, for example, have criticized Iran's nuclear ambitions and its crackdown on anti-government protesters, with Washington and Berlin also critical of China's drills near Taiwan and its treatment of the Muslim Uyghur minority in Xinjiang.In addition, Iran and China have been criticized by the West for not condemning Russia's war on Ukraine. Russia has even used Iranian drones to carry out attacks on Ukrainian cities, with the Iranian government rejecting it supplied the weapons.On the issue of Tehran's nuclear program, Xi told Raisi that Iran has a right to safeguard its interests. Xi said Beijing will continue to ""participate constructively"" on international negotiations regarding the 2015 Iran nuclear deal.US President Donald Trump pulled out of the Iran nuclear agreement in 2018, saying the Iranian government was not holding up its end of the bargain. The agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, lifted sanctions on Iran in return for Tehran's promises that it won't develop a nuclear weapon.""No matter how the international and regional situation changes, China will unswervingly develop friendly cooperation with Iran,"" Xi remarked.Iran and China also deepened their economic ties during the visit. China is Iran's biggest trading partner.Iranian media reported that China and Iran signed 20 cooperation documents during the visit, in areas such as tourism, international commerce, and technology.Raisi is accompanied on the China trip by a large trade and finance delegation.Xi previously held talks with Raisi at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in Uzbekistan last September.wd/rs (AFP, Reuters)",2023/02/14,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810401,U-Haul driver blames 'invisible object' for deadly rampage,"NEW YORK (AP) — A man who went on a deadly rampage with a U-Haul truck Monday in New York City was suffering from an apparent mental health crisis and said he started mowing people down after seeing an “invisible object” coming toward him, police said Tuesday.

            Weng Sor, 62, was charged Tuesday with murder and attempted murder in the attack, which unfolded over a harrowing 48 minutes over a large swath of Brooklyn’s bustling Bay Ridge neighborhood. Police eventually pinned the truck against a building after a miles-long chase.

            One person was killed and eight people were injured as the U-Haul truck veered onto sidewalks and plowed into bicyclists, moped riders and at least one pedestrian, hitting people at various points along a circuitous route. The truck also rammed a police car, and the officer inside was among the injured.











            The scope and length of the destruction led to questions about the NYPD's response and whether the pursuit — which at one point involved a police car speeding after the U-Haul up onto the sidewalk as a man dove to safety — put more people in harm's way.

            Sor, a troubled man with a history of violence and mental illness, told police that seeing an ""invisible object"" set him off, Chief of Detectives James Essig told reporters Tuesday. Sor's family said he'd stopped taking his medication, Essig said.

            “He states when he’s driving his van he sees an ‘invisible object’ come towards the car. At that point, he says, ‘I’ve had enough’ and he goes on his rampage,"" Essig said. “There was no object.”

            Sor, who lived in Las Vegas with his mother, came to New York last week after spending time in Florida and was pulled over twice in the U-Haul in the days prior to the attack, police said. He was walked out of a police station and was expected to be arraigned late Tuesday or Wednesday. Court records did not list a lawyer who could comment on his behalf. 

            The U-Haul struck three people on mopeds, three people on bicycles, one person on an e-bike and one person who was on foot as the truck moved through a busy section of Brooklyn, just north of the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge along New York Harbor, police said. The victims ranged in age from 30 to 66.

            A 44-year-old man riding a moped died from a head injury after he was hit by the truck roughly a half hour after it struck the first victim. Mayor Eric Adams said the man, whose name has not been made public, was a single father “raising those children on his own.”

            Mohammed Zakaria Salah Rakchi, 36, a delivery worker who emigrated from Algeria three years ago, was hit while running errands after dropping his 7-year-old daughter off at school. He suffered broken bones, including ribs, as well as other injuries and remained in a medically induced coma Tuesday. 

            A lawyer for Rakchi's family, Derek Sells, questioned whether being chased by police ""was a triggering event for this driver and what might have led him to do the things that he did.”

            NYPD policy requires officers to stop chasing vehicles when the risks to police and the public “outweigh the danger to the community.”

            Police Commissioner Keechant Sewell said Tuesday that the department is reviewing its response. The NYPD later posted body camera video images to social media showing officers urgently clearing a street full of elementary school children near where the U-Haul was wreaking havoc.

            Sor rented the U-Haul truck in West Palm Beach, Florida on Feb. 1, paying in advance for a 30-day rental. He remained there until Feb. 4, when he began driving north to Brooklyn, where his son and ex-wife live, Essig said.

            On Feb. 5, Sor was pulled over in South Carolina and cited for reckless driving and marijuana possession. He arrived in Brooklyn the next day, surprising his son when he showed up at his door in the middle of the night.

            Weng Sor’s son, Stephen Sor, 30, told The Associated Press that his father had a history of mental illness. Records show he was convicted and served time for multiple acts of violence, including stabbing his own brother.

            “Very frequently he’ll choose to skip out on his medications and do something like this,” Stephen Sor said in an interview outside his Brooklyn home. “This isn’t the first time he’s been arrested. It’s not the first time he’s gone to jail.”

            On Feb. 8, Essig said, police stopped Sor for speeding in the U-Haul on a Brooklyn highway where trucks and other commercial vehicles are prohibited. He was then spotted in New Jersey on Sunday, a day before the mayhem in Brooklyn, Essig said.

            The chase with police ended Monday when a police cruiser cut off the winding route and blocked the truck against a building near the entrance to a tunnel leading from Brooklyn to Manhattan, more than 3 miles (5 kilometers) from where the chase began.

            After Sor was stopped, Essig said he told police: “You should have shot me.”

            Sor's criminal history includes arrests for driving while intoxicated and evading a police officer in 2002 and multiple instances of battery.

            In 2015, Weng Sor stabbed his brother in Las Vegas and served about 17 months in a Nevada prison, according to court and prison records. In 2020, he stabbed someone in the arm and chest with a knife and was sentenced to 364 days in county jail.

            Before pleading guilty in that case, Sor was evaluated for several months at state psychiatric facilities before being found competent to face charges, court records show. The records don’t list any diagnosis, but note that Sor was placed on medications.

            In an earlier Nevada case, he was ordered to undergo counseling and perform community service after pleading guilty to misdemeanor battery in 2005. The judge noted at the time that Sor was moving to New York and ordered him to submit to a mental health evaluation once he arrived.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810402,EPA outlines $27B 'green bank' for clean energy projects,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration on Tuesday outlined how states and nonprofit groups can apply for $27 billion in funding from a “green bank” that will provide low-cost financing for projects intended to cut planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.

            The so-called Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, created by Congress in the landmark climate law approved last year, will invest in clean energy projects nationwide, with a focus on low-income and disadvantaged communities.

            The Environmental Protection Agency expects to award $20 billion in competitive grants to as many 15 nonprofit groups that will work with local banks and other financial institutions to invest in projects that reduce pollution and lower energy costs for families.











            Another $7 billion will be awarded to states, tribes and municipalities to deploy a range of solar energy projects, including residential rooftop solar, community solar and solar storage.

            EPA Administrator Michael Regan said the green bank — modeled after similar banks established in states such as Connecticut, New York and California — will unlock billions of dollars in private investment to enable neighborhoods and communities ""that have never participated in the clean-energy economy to participate in full force'' in creating green jobs.

            Low-income and disadvantaged communities ""who pay the largest percent of their income toward energy bills have been left out of the investment game (and) have not seen the infusion of private capital to help them realize opportunities ... for lots of reasons,'' said Regan, the first Black man to head the EPA.

            “What we are focused on here is ensuring that this $27 billion opportunity is thought-out in a way that allows for that community, that population, to be along for the ride,'' he added. ”Obviously, if this had been done before, there would be no reason for the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. We are charged with bringing private capital off the sideline.''

            The program expects to begin making grant awards this summer and has already received nearly 400 responses to preliminary inquiries, said Jahi Wise, the program's acting director.

            Even before the grants are awarded, Republicans in Congress have taken aim at the green bank, calling it a taxpayer-funded “slush fund” ripe for abuse.

            Rep. Gary Palmer, R-Ala., said he will sponsor a bill to repeal the fund, which he said will likely benefit Wall Street firms but ""doesn’t help the American people with their utility bills. 

            ""Will this $27 billion slush fund lower the cost of heating for these American families?” Palmer asked. 

            A spokesman for House Energy and Commerce Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., said the fund “allocates an incredible amount of authority and resources"" to the EPA, yet lacks measures to ensure accountability or transparency in how the resources are used.

            “In other words, this provision creates a taxpayer-funded slush fund for Wall Street and heightens the risk for overspending, fraud and abuse,” spokesman Sean Kelly said in a statement. 

            Democrats were much more optimistic, calling the fund a historic opportunity to cut greenhouse gas emissions, protect public health and create economic opportunity in disadvantaged and under-resourced communities.

            “For years, we’ve fought to take the idea of a national climate bank from a vision to a reality. With today’s action from the EPA, we’re one step closer,'' said Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., who pushed for the green bank along with Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey and other Democrats.

            Markey and Van Hollen said in a statement that they will work with EPA to ensure the new fund is national in scope, has a substantial “multiplier effect” with private investment and includes diverse stakeholders, including ""communities that have been historically underserved” by banks and other financial institutions.

            The EPA's announcement surprised some observers, who had considered the Coalition for Green Capital, a Washington-based non profit, as the likely choice to become the nation's de facto green bank, parceling out grants on behalf of the EPA. The politically influential group works with Connecticut and other states to accelerate investment in clean energy technologies.

            Instead, the EPA will issue grants directly to anywhere from two to 15 nonprofits, Regan said.

            Reed Hundt, chairman and CEO of the green capital group, applauded the EPA's announcement, saying the new fund will help fight climate change and create good-paying jobs. 

            Hundt, a lawyer and longtime ally of former Vice President Al Gore, said in a statement Tuesday that the coalition and its partners “appreciate the attention and care given to this program by the EPA.'' The group welcomes the opportunity to participate in the next steps outlined by the agency, he said.WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration on Tuesday outlined how states and nonprofit groups can apply for $27 billion in funding from a “green bank” that will provide low-cost financing for projects intended to cut planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.The so-called Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, created by Congress in the landmark climate law approved last year, will invest in clean energy projects nationwide, with a focus on low-income and disadvantaged communities.The Environmental Protection Agency expects to award $20 billion in competitive grants to as many 15 nonprofit groups that will work with local banks and other financial institutions to invest in projects that reduce pollution and lower energy costs for families.Another $7 billion will be awarded to states, tribes and municipalities to deploy a range of solar energy projects, including residential rooftop solar, community solar and solar storage.EPA Administrator Michael Regan said the green bank — modeled after similar banks established in states such as Connecticut, New York and California — will unlock billions of dollars in private investment to enable neighborhoods and communities ""that have never participated in the clean-energy economy to participate in full force'' in creating green jobs.Low-income and disadvantaged communities ""who pay the largest percent of their income toward energy bills have been left out of the investment game (and) have not seen the infusion of private capital to help them realize opportunities ... for lots of reasons,'' said Regan, the first Black man to head the EPA.“What we are focused on here is ensuring that this $27 billion opportunity is thought-out in a way that allows for that community, that population, to be along for the ride,'' he added. ”Obviously, if this had been done before, there would be no reason for the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. We are charged with bringing private capital off the sideline.''The program expects to begin making grant awards this summer and has already received nearly 400 responses to preliminary inquiries, said Jahi Wise, the program's acting director.Even before the grants are awarded, Republicans in Congress have taken aim at the green bank, calling it a taxpayer-funded “slush fund” ripe for abuse.Rep. Gary Palmer, R-Ala., said he will sponsor a bill to repeal the fund, which he said will likely benefit Wall Street firms but ""doesn’t help the American people with their utility bills.""Will this $27 billion slush fund lower the cost of heating for these American families?” Palmer asked.A spokesman for House Energy and Commerce Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., said the fund “allocates an incredible amount of authority and resources"" to the EPA, yet lacks measures to ensure accountability or transparency in how the resources are used.“In other words, this provision creates a taxpayer-funded slush fund for Wall Street and heightens the risk for overspending, fraud and abuse,” spokesman Sean Kelly said in a statement.Democrats were much more optimistic, calling the fund a historic opportunity to cut greenhouse gas emissions, protect public health and create economic opportunity in disadvantaged and under-resourced communities.“For years, we’ve fought to take the idea of a national climate bank from a vision to a reality. With today’s action from the EPA, we’re one step closer,'' said Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., who pushed for the green bank along with Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey and other Democrats.Markey and Van Hollen said in a statement that they will work with EPA to ensure the new fund is national in scope, has a substantial “multiplier effect” with private investment and includes diverse stakeholders, including ""communities that have been historically underserved” by banks and other financial institutions.The EPA's announcement surprised some observers, who had considered the Coalition for Green Capital, a Washington-based non profit, as the likely choice to become the nation's de facto green bank, parceling out grants on behalf of the EPA. The politically influential group works with Connecticut and other states to accelerate investment in clean energy technologies.Instead, the EPA will issue grants directly to anywhere from two to 15 nonprofits, Regan said.Reed Hundt, chairman and CEO of the green capital group, applauded the EPA's announcement, saying the new fund will help fight climate change and create good-paying jobs.Hundt, a lawyer and longtime ally of former Vice President Al Gore, said in a statement Tuesday that the coalition and its partners “appreciate the attention and care given to this program by the EPA.''

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810404,Tesla workers in NY launch campaign to organize a union,"NEW YORK (AP) — Tesla workers at a factory in New York are launching a campaign to organize a union in New York. 

            In a letter to management Tuesday, the Tesla Workers United organizing committee said that the employees are seeking a voice on the job at the plant in Buffalo and want to “build an even more collaborative environment that will strengthen the company.”

            Tesla CEO Elon Musk has taken a hard line against organized labor, despite an invitation to the United Auto Workers union to hold an organizing vote at Tesla’s factory in Fremont, California. In 2021 Tesla was ordered by the National Labor Relations Board to make Musk delete a 2018 tweet in which it said that he unlawfully threatened employees with loss of stock options if they chose to be represented by the UAW. 











            The tweet had said: ""“Nothing stopping Tesla team at our car plant from voting union. Could do so tmrw if they wanted. But why pay union dues and give up stock options for nothing? Our safety record is 2X better than when plant was UAW & everybody already gets healthcare.”

            In August 2022 the National Labor Relations Board reversed a Trump-era decision by finding that Tesla can’t stop factory employees from wearing clothing with union insignia while on the job. It ordered Tesla to stop enforcing an “overly broad” uniform policy that effectively stops production workers at Tesla’s Fremont, California, factory from wearing black shirts with the United Auto Workers union’s logo.

            Tesla labor organizers wrote Tuesday that they are seeking a union as innovative as the electric car company. 

            “We believe that by having a union at Tesla, we will further the mission of sustainability and foster a progressive environment for us all,” the letter said.

            It went on to say, in a story first reported by Bloomberg, that the union would further Tesla’s principles and objectives, including by helping to serve as the conscience of the organization.

            If successful, it would be the first union at the electric vehicle maker.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810405,Corbin Burnes and Brady Singer go to salary arbitration,"ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) — Two-time All-Star Corbin Burnes went to salary arbitration with the Milwaukee Brewers on Tuesday and Brady Singer had a hearing with the Kansas City Royals.

            Burnes asked for a raise from $6.55 million to $10.75 million and the Brewers argued for $10.01 million during a hearing before Melinda Gordon, Jules Bloch and Keith Greenberg.

            Singer requested a raise from $726,250 to $3,325,000 and the Royals pushed for $2.95 million during a hearing in front of Howard Edelman, Walt De Treux and Brian Keller.











            Decisions are expected Wednesday.

            Burnes, a 28-year-old right-hander, was 12-8 with a 2.94 ERA in 2022 and made a career-best 33 starts, which tied for most in the major leagues. He led the National League with 243 strikeouts, second in the big leagues behind New York Yankees ace Gerrit Cole at 257.

            Burnes won the 2021 NL Cy Young Award after leading the majors with a 2.43 ERA. He went 11-5 for the Brewers that year.

            A five-year veteran, Burnes is 35-19 with a 3.21 ERA. He is eligible for free agency after the 2024 World Series.

            Singer, a 26-year-old right-hander, was 10-5 with a 3.23 ERA in 24 starts and three relief appearances last year. He was optioned to Triple-A Omaha on April 28 and recalled on May 17.

            Singer was eligible for arbitration for the first time.

            Seven players remain scheduled for hearings, which run through Friday. In addition to Burnes and Singer, five have pending decisions: Los Angeles Angels outfielder Hunter Renfroe ($11.9 million vs. $11.25 million) and infielder Luis Rengifo ($2.3 million vs. $2 million), Tampa Bay relievers Ryan Thompson ($1.2 million vs. $1 million) and Colin Poche ($1.3 million vs. $1,175,000), and Rays outfielder Harold Ramirez ($2.2 million vs. $1.9 million).

            Players and teams have split six decisions.

            All-Star pitcher Max Fried ($13.5 million) lost to Atlanta, outfielder Kyle Tucker ($5 million) was beaten by Houston and reliever Diego Castillo ($2.95 million) was defeated by Seattle.

            Left-handed pitcher Jesús Luzardo ($2.45 million) and AL batting champion Luis Arraez ($6.1 million) both beat Miami, and reliever Jason Adam ($1,775,000) defeated Tampa Bay.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810406,Syria's Assad could reap rewards from aid crossing deal,"BEIRUT (AP) — A convoy of 11 trucks from a United Nations agency crossed into northern Syria from Turkey on Tuesday, just hours after the U.N. and Syrian government reached an agreement to temporarily authorize two new border crossings into the rebel enclave, devastated by the region's deadly earthquake.

            Syrian officials in Damascus said the decision, seven days after the 7.8 magnitude earthquake killed thousands, shows their commitment to supporting victims on both sides of the front line.

            The increased flow of help was desperately needed. But some critics say the deal is also a political victory for embattled Syrian President Bashar Assad, who permitted the U.N. to open new crossings and gave the impression that he ultimately called the shots on territory under opposition forces.











            The U.N. is normally authorized to deliver aid from Turkey to northwest Syria — an area already devastated by 12 years of conflict — through only one border crossing, Bab al-Hawa. Renewing that authorization is a regular battle at the Security Council, where Assad’s ally, Russia, has advocated for all aid to be routed through Damascus.

            The delay in opening new crossings stalled immediate relief and search and rescue efforts when the “time for effective search and rescue is tragically running out,” the International Rescue Committee said in statement.

            Asked why it took so long to increase aid access to the northwest, Syria’s U.N. ambassador Bassam Sabbagh told reporters, “Why are you asking me? We don’t control these borders.”

            The move by Damascus to open additional border crossings a week after the quake was more political than humanitarian, said Joseph Daher, a Swiss-Syrian researcher and professor at the European University Institute in Florence, Italy.

            “It’s a way for the regime to reaffirm its sovereignty, its centrality, and to instrumentalize this tragedy for its own political purposes,” he said.

            Before the deal with Damascus, advocates had been pushing for the Security Council to vote to permanently open more border crossings to aid deliveries — a move almost certain to be vetoed by Russia.

            Others argue that no Security Council resolution is needed for the U.N. to send aid across borders in an emergency. Daher pointed out that the U.N. had airdropped aid into the Syrian city of Deir Ezzor when it was besieged by Islamic State militants.

            Russia's foreign ministry Tuesday issued a statement condemning attempts to “push through” a permanent expansion of the authorized crossings.

            It said Western nations “continue to strangle"" Syria with sanctions that it said have caused a fuel crisis and ""prohibited the import of vital goods and equipment.”

            The United States, United Kingdom and European Union have imposed sanctions on Assad and oppose funneling aid to the northwest through his government, believing it would divert aid to its supporters. 

            A State Department spokesperson told the AP Tuesday that Washington will push for a U.N. resolution authorizing additional crossings as soon as possible. The U.S. last week issued a license to allow earthquake-related relief to bypass sanctions.

            The U.K. welcomed the temporary opening of new crossings, but said “sufficient access needs to be secured in the longer term.”

            When the earthquake hit, the U.N. could not immediately access Bab al-Hawa because of infrastructure damage, leaving the shattered enclave without significant aid for 72 hours.

            Northwest Syria’s civil defense organization, the White Helmets, said the delay in aid and the U.N.’s failure to take unorthodox measures those first few days cost lives, as they struggled with limited equipment and manpower to rescue thousands of people trapped under the rubble.

            The U.N. tried to send a delivery of aid to rebel-held Idlib through government-held territory on Sunday, but the shipment was halted after Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the al-Qaida-linked organization that controls the area, refused to accept aid coming from Assad-controlled areas.

            That standoff was “good politically ... for both sides,” Daher said, allowing the rebels “to say, ‘I’m not collaborating with the regime’ and for the regime to say, ’Look, we tried to send assistance.”

            Meanwhile, cargo planes loaded with aid have reached government-held territory, including from the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Egypt — countries that once shunned Assad and have slowly been reviving ties in recent years.

            Agreeing to the temporary additional crossings is to Assad’s political advantage,says Charles Lister, Director of the Syria program at Washington-based think thank Middle East Institute.

            The decision ""goes against everything that the regime has publicly stood by for the past 10-plus years when it comes to cross border aid delivery,” Lister said, referring to Syria and Russia’s attempts at ending the U.N. cross-border aid mechanism.

            But with the deal, the Syrian government ""knows it has proved to the world that the United Nations is unwilling to do anything in Syria without the regime’s permission.”

            Saria Akkad, partnerships and advocacy manager with the Ataa Humanitarian Relief Association, which works in Turkey and northwest Syria, said that Syrians like him now feel that their advocacy to the U.N. was pointless. “We should maybe go back to Assad, we should discuss with the person who killed his people, how he can support the people in northwest Syria,"" he said. 

            Lister said the current crisis has allowed Assad to “bait the international community into normalization"", though he doesn't expect a total end of his political isolation without major shifts form Washington and London.

            Syrian officials have urged the U.N. to fund reconstruction, and Lister believes that this, in addition to the lifting of Western sanctions, is what Damascus hopes to get.

            The temporary authorization ends in three months, around the time negotiations take place before the U.N. Security Council meets in July to review the cross-border resolution. Lister believes that Assad’s agreement with the U.N. could allow him to ask for more in return in exchange for allowing the resolution to continue without a Russian veto.

            “I think what we frankly saw yesterday was the U.N. politicizing aid delivery by going to the regime to secure access to a border crossing they don’t have control over,” he said. “It put all its eggs into the regime’s basket.”BEIRUT (AP) — A convoy of 11 trucks from a United Nations agency crossed into northern Syria from Turkey on Tuesday, just hours after the U.N. and Syrian government reached an agreement to temporarily authorize two new border crossings into the rebel enclave, devastated by the region's deadly earthquake.Syrian officials in Damascus said the decision, seven days after the 7.8 magnitude earthquake killed thousands, shows their commitment to supporting victims on both sides of the front line.The increased flow of help was desperately needed.

            The senator, who turns 90 in June, is the oldest member of Congress and has faced questions in recent years about her cognitive health and memory, though she has defended her effectiveness representing a state that is home to nearly 40 million people.

            The announcement came after several prominent California Democrats, including U.S. Reps. Katie Porter and Adam Schiff, already had declared Senate campaigns. With Feinstein a now 30-year veteran of the Senate, there hasn’t been a wide open competition for her seat in decades. 











            Feinstein plans to remain in Congress through the end of her current term. Speaking to reporters in Washington on Tuesday, she said “there's times for all things under the sun.”

            “I think that will be the right time, towards the end of next year,"" she said.

            Feinstein is one of the Senate's few remaining veterans of the so-called Year of the Woman, referring to several women who were elected to the male-dominated chamber during the 1992 election. But even before she moved to Washington, Feinstein was one of the most prominent women in American politics.

            She was the first woman to serve as president of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in the 1970s and the first female mayor of San Francisco. She ascended to that post after the November 1978 assassinations of then-Mayor George Moscone and City Supervisor Harvey Milk by a former supervisor, Dan White. Feinstein found Milk’s body.

            In the Senate, she was the first woman to head the Senate Intelligence Committee and the first woman to serve as the Judiciary Committee’s top Democrat. She gained a reputation as a pragmatic centrist who left a mark on political battles over issues ranging from reproductive rights to environmental protection.

            Feinstein is particularly closely associated with efforts to broaden gun restrictions. Early in her career, the Senate approved her amendment to ban manufacturing and sales of certain types of assault weapons as part of a crime bill that President Bill Clinton signed into law in 1994. The ban expired 10 years later and was never replaced, but it remained a trademark issue in a career that was molded by gun violence.

            “Through force of will, she led the fight to get the assault weapons ban passed. Like so many who have been touched by gun violence, that victory was personal for her,” President Joe Biden said in a statement. “I’ve served with more U.S. senators than just about anyone. I can honestly say that Dianne Feinstein is one of the very best.”

            She was also known for reaching out to Republicans to find middle ground. While that may have helped her notch legislative accomplishments in Washington, it chafed some in a Democratic Party that has moved increasingly to the left in recent years.

            That frustration was on display during her last reelection campaign in 2018. The California Democratic Party endorsed a liberal rival for the seat over her, with some delegates complaining Feinstein had been in Washington too long and hadn’t stood strong enough for immigrants.

            She infuriated liberals in 2020 when she closed out confirmation hearings for Justice Amy Coney Barrett with an embrace of Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Lindsey Graham, a Republican, and a public thanks to him for a job well done.

            Liberal advocacy groups that had fiercely opposed Barrett’s nomination to replace the late liberal icon Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg were furious and called for her to step down from the committee leadership. A month later, she announced she would remain on the Judiciary Committee but step down as the top Democrat.

            But such tension was forgotten on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, where Democrats praised Feinstein's career. At a closed door lunch of Democratic senators, the lawmakers broke into rounds of applause for Feinstein after Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced her decision.

            “She’s a legend,” Schumer later told reporters. “A legend in California as the first woman senator; a legend in this Senate. She was the leader on so many different issues, assault weapons, environment, women’s rights, and so much else. She approached everything studiously and carefully.”

            At the lunch, Feinstein told her colleagues how hard her husband’s death was and that she would be ready to step away from public life after finishing this term, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said afterward. Feinstein's husband, Richard Blum, died last year.

            “Senator Feinstein made history,” said Warren. “She changed this country and she was a woman on the front lines in fights, like access to assault weapons, and national security and intelligence.”

            Warren added: “Every other woman in public office owes a special debt to Dianne Feinstein.” 

            In her home state, where Feinstein is the longest serving U.S. senator, she was lionized for her historic tenure in public service. 

            Democratic U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the former House speaker, called her San Francisco neighbor “a titan” of the Senate who, among her accomplishments, steered billions of federal dollars to California for environmental protection. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom called Feinstein a mentor and credited her with “blazing a trail for a new generation of female lawmakers.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810410,Clarence Thomas statue backed by Republicans in Georgia,"ATLANTA (AP) — Republican Georgia lawmakers are again trying to erect a statue of U.S. Supreme Court Justice and Georgia native Clarence Thomas on the state Capitol grounds in Atlanta, in what many Democrats, particularly Black ones, see as an insensitive display of partisan power.

            The Georgia state Senate voted 32-20 along party lines on Tuesday to mandate a statue of the Pin Point, Georgia, native. Minority Democrats had proposed amending the measure to also mandate a statue of the late Georgia congressman and civil rights icon John Lewis, but then pulled back the amendment.

            
                Senate Bill 69 moves to the state House for more debate.











            Sen. Ben Watson, a Savannah Republican, said he represents Thomas' birthplace near the coastal city and had known Thomas' mother.

            “This native son of Georgia deserves a place of honor and recognition on our Capitol grounds, a place where future generations of Georgians can learn valuable lessons from his legacy and gain inspiration and belief that their lofty dreams are obtainable too in America, regardless of the circumstances into which they are born,"" Watson told senators.

            Democrats, though, recoiled. They cited not only Thomas' confirmation to the court in 1991 amid Anita Hill's testimony that he had sexually harassed her, but also Thomas' rulings on the Supreme Court. 

            “His service is problematic,” said Sen. Nan Orrock of Atlanta. “There’s a cloud over his service … and that cloud continues today.”

            Republicans countered that the Georgia Capitol grounds has a statue of former Democratic Gov. and President Jimmy Carter.

            “There are citizens, probably members of this body, that take issue with his policies when he was governor or president, but we respect history,” said Sen. Jason Anavitarte, a Republican from Dallas.

            The debate came on the same day that Republican senators also pushed through a resolution honoring former U.S. Sen. Kelly Loeffler, who was defeated by Democrat Raphael Warnock in 2020, giving his party a Senate majority. As part of the Republican's continuing political activity, Loeffler spearheaded an effort last year to elect Republicans to the state Senate, where they now have a 33-23 majority.

            Opponents of the statue pointed to Thomas' concurring opinion last year to overturn the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that established nationwide access to abortion. In that opinion, he called on his fellow justices to revisit other Supreme Court precedents that legalized same-sex marriage and access to contraception.

            Sen. Emanuel Jones, a Decatur Democrat who is Black, called Thomas an “Uncle Tom,” saying the justice is like someone who has “sold his soul to the slave master.”

            “There’s a whole laundry list of positions that Justice Thomas has taken that I find offensive,"" Jones said. ""Sometimes, when I talk to the majority party, I say, ‘Y’all just don’t get it.’” 

            Democrats also criticized Thomas' wife, Virginia “Ginni” Thomas, noting records show she texted then-White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows after the 2020 election, urging him to stand with then-President Donald Trump as he falsely claimed there was widespread fraud in the election. 

            Ginni Thomas later told the House Jan. 6 committee that she regrets the texts and told investigators that her activity after the election was minimal. But Georgia Democrats said Tuesday that they are not yet convinced that Ginni Thomas bore no blame.

            “His wife actually encouraged this coup of violence in an attempt to stop the peaceful transfer of power for the first time in our country’s history,"" said Sen. Nikki Merritt, a Lawrenceville Democrat.

            Republicans passed a measure approving a Clarence Thomas statue last year in the state Senate, but it never came to a vote in the state House. This year's bill says the statue would be paid for with private money.

            Democrats had proposed an amendment to the bill to also mandate a statue of Lewis, but pulled the proposal back before it could get a vote. If Republicans had voted for the amendment, Democrats would have been forced to either vote for the Thomas statue or against a Lewis statue.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810411,Murdaugh's sister-in-law saw odd behavior after killings,"Alex Murdaugh's sister-in-law testified Tuesday in his double murder trial that she thought it was odd that he didn't seem scared in the weeks after his son Paul and wife Maggie were killed at their South Carolina home.

            Marian Proctor told jurors her family was distraught after the killings. She said Alex Murdaugh was devastated too, but that he said a few odd things about the deaths of his wife and son.

            “He did not know who it was, but he thought whoever had done it had thought about it a really long time,” Proctor said.











            Alex Murdaugh, 54, faces 30 years to life in prison if convicted of killing his 52-year-old wife and their 22-year-old son, whose bodies were found June 7, 2021, near the kennels at the hunting lodge where the disgraced attorney lived with his family.

            Proctor said Tuesday she had a great relationship with her nephew and her brother-in-law. Alex Murdaugh spent time with his in-laws after the killings as they all sorted through their grief.

            But Proctor said that as time went on, there were some nagging doubts that entered her mind, especially Alex Murdaugh's focus on Paul Murdaugh's role in a 2019 boat crash where a teenager died. Investigators said Paul Murdaugh was driving the boat and charged him with boating under the influence.

            “He said that his number one goal was clearing Paul's name,” Proctor said. “And I thought that was so strange because my number one goal was to find out who killed my sister and Paul.” 

            During cross-examination, Proctor said Maggie Murdaugh was adamant that her son wasn't driving the boat and wanted to clear his name too.

            Proctor testified that Alex and Maggie Murdaugh had a special relationship with only occasional and typical disagreements.

            “It was good,” Proctor said. “It wasn't perfect. But Maggie was happy.”

            Prosecutors wanted to ask Proctor about Maggie Murdaugh's suspicions 15 years ago that her husband was having an affair, but the judge ruled that was too far in the past to be relevant.

            Proctor testified her opinion of her brother-in-law started to change in September 2021 when police said Alex Murdaugh asked a friend to kill him on the side of the road so his surviving son could get a $10 million life insurance policy, but the shot just grazed his head. 

            At the same time, news started to emerge the investigators thought Alex Murdaugh stole from his family law firm and clients. Murdaugh is facing about 100 other charges outside of murder.

            Prosecutors have said Murdaugh killed his family to gain sympathy and then stall to try to cover up most of those crimes. The defense has said it is absurd to think a seasoned attorney like Murdaugh would believe scrutiny about his life would diminish if his wife and son were brutally killed.

            Earlier Tuesday, prosecutors called their 53rd witness of their case. Dale Davis lived down the road and fed and took care of the family dogs at their kennels.

            Davis detailed where he kept each dog in the kennel, how and where water would pool when he washed out the kennels, and how he made sure the water didn't pool near the feed room, because it was rotting the wood.

            “I’m very particular about how I roll that hose up,"" Davis testified as he examined a picture taken by police after the killings. ""It's kinked up. There's pressure on that hose ... somebody used that hose after I did.”

            Prosecutors have suggested, but haven't directly said or presented evidence, that the lack of items connecting Alex Murdaugh to the killings — such as weapons that haven't been found and blood found only near the bodies and not on clothes — indicate Murdaugh cleaned up the crime scene before heading to visit his ailing mother that night. Murdaugh called 911 saying he found the bodies after returning home from that trip.

            In cross examination, defense attorney Jim Griffin showed Davis a video from the kennels that prosecutors have said Paul Murdaugh took minutes before the killings. Prosecutors have used it with other witnesses to identify Alex Murdaugh’s voice along with the voices of his son and wife, to show he was at the kennels even though he told police he wasn’t there.

            Griffin stopped the video about two-thirds of the way in and asked Davis what he could see in the background. It was the hose, in a haphazard pile.

            Griffin also asked Davis about a time a hunting dog got gravely injured in a kennel and needed to be put out of its misery.

            “Mr. Alex couldn’t shoot that dog; he asked you to do it, didn't he?"" Griffin asked.

            “Yup,” Davis said.

            Later, prosecutor David Fernandez asked, “Did Alex do a lot of hunting?” and Davis agreed. 

            Court began Tuesday with a pathologist sticking to her findings that Maggie Murdaugh was shot four or five times with a rifle while Paul Murdaugh was shot twice with a shotgun.

            Dr. Ellen Riemer said the last shots on each victim appeared to be to their heads. She said both victims appeared to have their arms and hands by their sides, with no injuries indicating they tried to protect themselves, Riemer said.

            As he did Monday, Alex Murdaugh cried during much of Riemer's testimony, especially as she detailed the injuries to his wife and son. Murdaugh smiled and laughed when Davis testified that he went home after caring for the dogs, took a shower and “was in my recliner the rest of the night.”

            There was no mention of COVID-19 in court Tuesday. On Monday, two jurors were dismissed after testing positive for the virus and the clerk of court also has COVID, leading to worries that the virus has been spreading through the courtroom and could cause a delay or a mistrial.Alex Murdaugh's sister-in-law testified Tuesday in his double murder trial that she thought it was odd that he didn't seem scared in the weeks after his son Paul and wife Maggie were killed at their South Carolina home.Marian Proctor told jurors her family was distraught after the killings.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810412,Koh-i-noor diamond not part of King Charles III’s coronation,"LONDON (AP) — The Koh-i-noor diamond won’t be used during King Charles III’s coronation, allowing Buckingham Palace to sidestep the controversy surrounding a gem acquired during the age of Empire.

            Camilla, the queen consort, will not to use the diamond in her coronation crown. Rather than commission a new crown, as is customary, Camilla will modify Queen Mary’s crown using diamonds from Queen Elizabeth II’s personal collection, the palace said in a statement Tuesday.

            Seized by the East India Company after its victory in the Second Anglo-Sikh War of 1849, the gem was given to Queen Victoria and has remained part of the Crown Jewels ever since.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810413,Mets head into spring training knowing expectations are high,"PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. (AP) — Heading into a season with a record payroll projected at $370 million, the New York Mets realize the expectations.

            “Is our season a failure if we win 90 — whatever number you want to come up with?” manager Buck Showalter said Tuesday, a day ahead of the team's reporting day. “It’s about the endgame.”

            Justin Verlander, the AL Cy Young Award winner signed to an $86.7 million, two-year contract, threw his first bullpen session for the Mets. 











            “Just like all pitchers, regardless of their background and their success, you’re trying to serve their needs and create an atmosphere that they can be as good as they can be,” Showalter said. 

            Max Scherzer or Verlander figures to start the March 30 opener at Miami with baseball buzzing about the team's record spending under owner Steve Cohen.

            New York won 101 games last year, second-most in franchise history but was unable to hold off Atlanta in the NL East after sitting atop the division for all but six days. The Mets were eliminated by San Diego in a three-game Wild Card Series.

            “You don’t talk about it,” Showalter said. “It’s kind of those looks, without saying anything. They know, believe me. Like, who in here likes talking about unpleasant times?” 

            While losing Jacob deGrom, Taijuan Walker and Chris Bassitt in free agency, the Mets added Verlander, José Quintana and Kodai Senga to join Scherzer and Carlos Carrasco in the rotation. New York re-signed closer Edwin Díaz and outfielder Brandon Nimmo and replaced catcher James McCann with Omar Narváez.

            All the spending increased the Mets' projected payroll to $370 million for 2023 and $390 million for purposes of the luxury tax — which would result in a tax of about $115 million.

            “Our expectation is to win the championship,” Díaz said. “We are looking forward to start winning games and trying to be in the World Series.”

            Showalter is pleased with the switch to a balanced schedule.

            “We played the 79 games in our division last year. Almost half our season was played in our division last year,” Showalter said. “We’re playing 52 this year. Do the math that’s 27 less.”

            Showalter said the Mets are hopeful outfielder Starling Marte will be ready for opening day following core muscle surgery on Nov.. 1.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810415,Court nixes Fox News' bid to end voting tech firm's suit,"NEW YORK (AP) — Fox News lost an attempt Tuesday to shut down a multibillion-dollar defamation lawsuit that accuses the network of spreading lies that a voting-technology company helped “steal” the 2020 election from then-U.S. President Donald Trump. 

            New York's Supreme Court Appellate Division, a mid-level appeals court, ruled against the network, which wanted judges to dismiss the $2.7 billion defamation case.

            The company that brought the case, Smartmatic, has said it played a valid and small role in the election. It hailed the ruling as a step toward holding Fox News accountable for amplifying unsupported and damaging claims from Trump's lawyers. 











            Fox News cast the case as an attempt to chill journalism, expressing confidence the network ultimately would prevail.

            Tuesday's decision means Smartmatic's suit continues against Fox News, hosts Maria Bartiromo and Jeanine Pirro, former host Lou Dobbs, and Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani. A claim against Trump lawyer Sidney Powell was dismissed earlier because she doesn't have ties to New York, where the case was filed. 

            The five-judge ruling concluded there were “significant allegations” that Giuliani and Powell defamed the company. 

            “The complaint alleges in detailed fashion that in their coverage and commentary, Fox News, Dobbs, and Bartiromo effectively endorsed and participated in the statements with reckless disregard for, or serious doubts about” whether there was any reliable evidence for them, five judges wrote in a unanimous opinion. Citing “the same reasoning,” they also reinstated Smartmatic's claims against Pirro, which a lower court had thrown out.

            
                Federal and state election officials, exhaustive reviews in battleground states and Trump’s own attorney general found no widespread fraud that could have changed the outcome of the 2020 election. Nor did they uncover any credible evidence that the vote was tainted. Trump’s allegations of fraud also were roundly rejected by dozens of courts, including by judges whom he had appointed.

            The ruling comes as Fox News fights a separate, $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit from Denver-based Dominion Voting Systems, with a trial date in April. The network also is fighting lawsuit from a Venezuelan businessman who said he was wrongly accused of trying to corrupt the election.

            Florida-based Smartmatic said that in the 2020 presidential election, its technology and software were used only in California’s Los Angeles County. The Democratic bastion went, as expected, for Democratic nominee and now-President Joe Biden.

            But Smartmatic says Fox News and the three hosts repeatedly allowed Trump's lawyers to falsely portray Smartmatic as a foreign company involved in a sprawling, multi-state operation to “flip” votes to Biden from the Republican incumbent.

            During a series of post-Election Day appearances, Giuliani asserted that the company had been “formed in order to fix elections.” Powell called it a “huge criminal conspiracy,” and the two claimed that proof would be forthcoming.

            After Smartmatic’s lawyers demanded a retraction, Fox News aired an interview with an election technology expert who said there was no evidence that the company's technology had monkeyed with the election results. He refuted various claims that Giuliani and Powell made. 

            “Fox News, its news anchors and guests knowingly and falsely published lies,” Smartmatic lawyer J. Erik Connolly said in a statement Tuesday. The company maintains that the network can’t claim free speech protections for its conduct. 

            Fox News argues that it can, saying it was informing the public about newsworthy, if controversial, claims from an important figure about a matter of public concern.

            “There is nothing more newsworthy than covering the president of the United States and his lawyers making allegations of voter fraud,"" the network said, adding that it was confident it would be vindicated. Fox News called the damages claim “outrageous” and ""nothing more than a flagrant attempt to deter our journalists from doing their jobs.” 

            A message seeking comment on Tuesday's ruling was sent to Giuliani’s lawyers. They have said Giuliani's statements were protected by the First Amendment and other laws and principles.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810417,5 German police officers charged over Senegal teen's death,"Prosecutors in Germany said Tuesday that five police officers have been charged over the death of a Senegalese teenager who was shot dead last year.

            Police had been called to an incident at a foster home in the western city of Dortmund on Aug. 8, 2022, because the 16-year-old refugee had allegedly threatened to harm himself with a knife.

            Officers claimed the teen, identified as Mouhamed Dramé, had run toward them with a knife, whereupon they used pepper spray and two tasers before shooting him with an automatic pistol.











            German news agency dpa reported that the officer who fired the shots was being charged with manslaughter, while his superior officer was being charged with incitement to dangerous bodily harm. Three other officers were charged with dangerous bodily harm, dpa reported.

            Public broadcaster WDR quoted Dortmund prosecutors saying they believe the operation was “disproportionate from the start.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810429,Virginians face terrorism charges years after Pakistan trial,"ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) — It was almost 15 years ago when five young men from northern Virginia left the U.S. to pursue dreams of jihad in Afghanistan, only to find themselves under arrest in Pakistan when their farewell video prompted family members to contact the FBI.

            Now, after the five served a decade in a Pakistani prison, U.S. prosecutors are moving forward with plans to put them on trial again for terrorism charges.

            At a status hearing Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Alexandria, however, a judge gave strong indications that she plans to toss out charges against one of the men on grounds that torture and solitary confinement he allegedly endured in Pakistan have rendered him mentally incompetent.











            In fact, U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema has questioned the utility of bringing charges against any of the five, given the fact that they were convicted and punished already in Pakistan.

            “If these men have been prosecuted in Pakistan and served significant periods of incarceration in a Pakistani prison, and now the United States government is trying to charge them for essentially the same conduct in this country, you’ve got to think about whether that makes sense,” Brinkema said during a December status hearing on the case.

            The five men — Waqar Khan, Ahmed Minni, Ramy Zamzam, Aman Yemer, and Umar Farooq — originally came to the FBI's attention only after family reported them missing. 

            In late 2009, the five left the U.S. for Pakistan, leaving behind an 11-minute video espousing the need to engage in holy war to defend Muslim lands under attack. Family members sought to stop them from making the trip once they learned of the plans, reaching out to a Muslim civil rights group, the Council on American-Islamic Relations, and eventually to lawyer Nina Ginsberg and the FBI.

            But the five had already made it to Pakistan and began looking for people who could help them get to Afghanistan. They were frequently turned away by those they sought out, according to a recently unsealed FBI affidavit, although one man suggested he could help if one of the five's extended family in Pakistan could vouch for them.

            They were arrested in Sargodha, a city in the eastern province of Punjab, on Dec. 9, 2009, about nine days after the FBI learned they left the U.S., according to the affidavit. 

            Several members of the group admitted to FBI agents that their goal was to fight against American troops if they got to Afghanistan.

            The five were charged in Pakistan, where they say they were tortured during their detention — allegations denied by Pakistani authorities. All five were convicted and received 10-year terms. 

            After serving their sentences, the U.S. government has sought to bring them to the U.S. to face charges here. So far, though, only three of the defendants — Zamzam, Yemer and Minni — have been deported back to the U.S. A fourth remains in Pakistani custody, and a fifth is at large there.

            Yemer, who was just 18 when he was arrested and is the youngest of the five, faces serious mental health problems. Ginsberg, his lawyer, said in court that Yemer's faculties eroded after mistreatment and solitary confinement in Pakistan. As she described it, Yemer sits in a chair all day, nonresponsive. He only eats if he is fed, and he only goes to the bathroom if someone takes him to a toilet. 

            Months in a hospital, including electroshock treatment, were largely unsuccessful, she said. 

            “They just totally incapacitated him,” Ginsberg said after Tuesday's hearing, in which her client appeared dressed in a gray tracksuit, his face blank. 

            Ginsberg said during the hearing that she was hopeful the U.S. would drop the charges against her client. Brinkema gave clear indication she will dismiss the charges against Yemer as soon as Ginsberg files a motion seeking dismissal regardless of whether the Justice Department agrees.

            As for the other defendants, prosecutor John Gibbs expressed optimism that a plea deal will be reached and circumvent the need for a trial. Lawyers for Zamzam and Minni have said that if a deal can't be reached, they plan to seek dismissal on grounds that their clients were denied the right to a speedy trial, among other potential issues. 

            At a hearing in December, Brinkema raised the question of whether a U.S. trial would amount to double jeopardy, although it was not immediately clear whether the trial in Pakistan would allow the defendants to claim double jeopardy protection in the U.S.

            Ginsberg, for her part, said she doesn't believe the men deserve any further incarceration in the U.S.

            “Ten years in a Pakistani prison is like 30 years in the U.S.,” she said. “They've had enough.”ALEXANDRIA, Va.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810430,GOP's intraparty power battle roiling lawmaking in Ohio,"COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — A battle for political control of the Ohio House has laid bare the risks the Republican Party faces as factions of its legislative supermajority square off more over tactics and the willingness to thwart long held institutional norms than policy.

            Six weeks ago, Republican Jason Stephens, a second-term representative from rural southern Ohio, scored a surprise bipartisan win for speaker over Rep. Derek Merrin. Since then, Stephens' detractors have grabbed headline after headline for their maneuvers — even as a single piece of legislation is yet to be introduced. That includes the crucial and time-sensitive state budget. 

            And the clashes appear far from over. With Stephens preparing finally to unveil Republicans' session priorities Wednesday, a group of GOP lawmakers lined up against him — calling themselves “the Republican Majority Caucus” — have not ruled out suing him for control of the caucus campaign fund. 











            The faction wants a judge to clarify whether the House speaker and the head of the caucus need necessarily be the same person. While Ohio law does not seem to require it, Stephens has asserted he is both.

            “I’m the speaker of the House, the head of the Republican caucus, and I’m excited for us to get ready and move forward,” Stephens told reporters after successfully passing House rules Jan. 24 during a typically boring procedural session-turned-raucous. 

            “We now have our House in order,” he declared, even as Merrin backers stood nearby alleging constitutional and rules violations. Those included that Stephens had failed to let them speak on the floor — a time-honored tool of speakers everywhere — and begun the session at 2:05 p.m. rather than 2 p.m.

            It's all part of a growing line of attacks against Stephens and the Republican representatives who supported him that is roiling lawmaking in a state where the GOP rules every branch of state government and twice chose Republican Donald Trump for president by wide margins. 

            The fight has included a declared takeover of the GOP caucus by Merrin's camp, a call for Stephens' resignation, censure of Stephens and his GOP supporters by the Ohio Republican Party's central committee and attack ads by one of several same-party PACs that are starting now to fight their reelections. 

            ""There’s a lot of people right now who don’t feel like they have a voice, because the Democrats elected the speaker of the House,” Merrin told reporters the day he declared himself in charge of the caucus and its fundraising operation, despite Stephens' election. The Associated Press has not yet received records on that closed-door vote in response to its requests. 

            Fracturing is a known risk of supermajority rule. 

            Aristotle Hutras, who served as executive secretary to the late Democratic Ohio House Speaker Vernal Riffe, who led the chamber from 1975 to 1995, recalled the legendary Ohio politician worrying aloud after his party won 62 of 99 seats in 1982: “It might be too many, boys.” Republicans this year have 67. 

            “Even Vern Riffe, historically the longest serving speaker in Ohio history, knew it could be difficult governing with too much of a majority,” said Hutras, who was a young caucus staffer in 1982. “When there are too many in a caucus, every man is a king.”

            Hutras said Riffe resolved conflict quickly by getting straight to work.

            Merrin's group believes math is on their side. Forty-three of 67 House Republicans supported him for speaker, a clear majority of the caucus. But 22 broke off and supported Stephens, defying results of an informal speaker vote in November and teaming with all 32 House Democrats. 

            Clearly perplexed, angry and stung, the Merrin camp went on the attack. Though Merrin is term-limited in two years, many of his allies are new lawmakers whose ability to make their marks could depend on caucus financial support. 

            They asked the state party's central committee to condemn Stephens and those who voted for him, including withholding future party endorsements and campaign cash. The panel didn't go quite that far, but they did vote to censure the 22 lawmakers — as they had after then-U.S. Rep. Anthony Gonzalez voted in favor of Trump's impeachment.

            Their resolution cast Democrats as the enemy, with a “dangerous and perverse” agenda that Stephens and the others had now prevented Republicans from blocking. 

            Targeted lawmakers pushed back. State Rep. Bill Seitz, a long-serving Cincinnati Republican, said his record as a conservative was clear. State Rep. Sara Carruthers chided Merrin in a Dayton Daily News interview, calling him a crybaby who couldn't stand being outmaneuvered.

            State Rep. Jon Cross quipped to the USA Today Network’s Ohio bureau, “What you're telling me is I'm a Republican that voted for a Republican speaker and the state Republican party is censuring me? Sounds like the dipsh--s are running the insane asylum.”

            The Ironton Tribune, located in the seat of the county where Stephens is a former commissioner and auditor, called the censure “juvenile” and “politics at its worst.” 

            “(T)here seems to be no interest in turning down the outlandish rhetoric and acting like the adults in the room,” they wrote. 

            The paper called on Republican Gov. Mike DeWine to speak out and urge the party to “move toward actually getting things done in Columbus.” 

            DeWine, an establishment Republican whose support for Trump has been tepid, has faced his own share of run-ins with the state central committee — where opponents of his aggressive early response to the coronavirus have grown in their numbers. He said he was staying out of it.

            His budget bill, a $57.5 billion blueprint for state spending over the two years beginning July 1, is among House bills that are yet to materialize — though some committee activity has begun on the proposal. 

            Stephens' and Merrin's differences appear largely to surround stylistic decisions, including how quickly a measure to the ballot that would make it harder to amend Ohio's constitution should be pushed and whether to fully eliminate Ohio's income tax, for example. 

            A key exception is with regard to unions. Stephens questions a so-called “backpack bill” that would extend Ohio's vouchers to every schoolchild, including those attending private schools, and appears to have rejected bringing an anti-union “right to work” bill this session, which had been a Merrin priority.

            Groups touting parents' rights, a burgeoning Republican priority nationally, have used union donations to try to link Stephens and his leadership team to former Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder, who's on trial for corruption in Cincinnati. They cast the group as in the pocket of “Big Labor,” including the same teachers' unions that supported Householder and have opposed the backpack bill.

            “Conservatives in Ohio are aghast at the backroom deal-making that led to the speakership of Jason Stephens,"" said former U.S. Senate candidate and Ohio Strong Action PAC Chair Mike Gibbons. ""Because we have seen time and again, these deals end up sacrificing principled conservative policy.”

            He said he represents a group of conservative leaders, and groups that have a clear agenda. They are pushing to retire Ohio's income tax and for a suite of bills that died last session, including the backpack bill, a ban on transgender student-athletes in girls sports and one prohibiting gender affirming surgeries to minors. 

            They also back a ballot proposal that would raise the threshold for changing Ohio’s constitution from 50% to 60%. That idea arose suddenly during last year's lameduck session, just as issues guaranteeing abortion rights, reforming redistricting and legalizing recreational marijuana were being contemplated. Then-Speaker Bob Cupp, also a Republican, declined to bring the issue to the floor for a lack of votes. Under Stephens, the House missed a Feb. 1 cutoff for getting it on the spring ballot. 

            Gibbons said his coalition will be bringing its issues “straight to the voters of Ohio, making the case” in the coming weeks.

            Samantha Hendrickson is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative. Report for America is a nonprofit national service program that places journalists in local newsrooms to report on undercovered issues.COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — A battle for political control of the Ohio House has laid bare the risks the Republican Party faces as factions of its legislative supermajority square off more over tactics and the willingness to thwart long held institutional norms than policy.Six weeks ago, Republican Jason Stephens, a second-term representative from rural southern Ohio, scored a surprise bipartisan win for speaker over Rep. Derek Merrin. Since then, Stephens' detractors have grabbed headline after headline for their maneuvers — even as a single piece of legislation is yet to be introduced. That includes the crucial and time-sensitive state budget.And the clashes appear far from over. With Stephens preparing finally to unveil Republicans' session priorities Wednesday, a group of GOP lawmakers lined up against him — calling themselves “the Republican Majority Caucus” — have not ruled out suing him for control of the caucus campaign fund.The faction wants a judge to clarify whether the House speaker and the head of the caucus need necessarily be the same person. While Ohio law does not seem to require it, Stephens has asserted he is both.“I’m the speaker of the House, the head of the Republican caucus, and I’m excited for us to get ready and move forward,” Stephens told reporters after successfully passing House rules Jan. 24 during a typically boring procedural session-turned-raucous.“We now have our House in order,” he declared, even as Merrin backers stood nearby alleging constitutional and rules violations. Those included that Stephens had failed to let them speak on the floor — a time-honored tool of speakers everywhere — and begun the session at 2:05 p.m. rather than 2 p.m.It's all part of a growing line of attacks against Stephens and the Republican representatives who supported him that is roiling lawmaking in a state where the GOP rules every branch of state government and twice chose Republican Donald Trump for president by wide margins.The fight has included a declared takeover of the GOP caucus by Merrin's camp, a call for Stephens' resignation, censure of Stephens and his GOP supporters by the Ohio Republican Party's central committee and attack ads by one of several same-party PACs that are starting now to fight their reelections.""There’s a lot of people right now who don’t feel like they have a voice, because the Democrats elected the speaker of the House,” Merrin told reporters the day he declared himself in charge of the caucus and its fundraising operation, despite Stephens' election.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810431,Judge vacates conviction of man imprisoned nearly 3 decades,"ST. LOUIS (AP) — A Missouri judge on Tuesday overturned the conviction of a man who has served nearly 28 years of a life sentence for a killing that he has always said he didn't commit.

            Lamar Johnson, 50, closed his eyes and shook his head slightly as a member of his legal team patted him on the back when Circuit Judge David Mason issued his ruling. In coming to his decision, Mason explained that there had to be “reliable evidence of actual innocence — evidence so reliable that it actually passes the standard of clear and convincing.”

            Johnson walked free after he was processed out at the courthouse. Beaming, he walked up to reporters in the courthouse lobby about two hours after the ruling and thanked everyone who worked on his case, as well as the judge.











            “This is unbelievable,” said Johnson, who didn't take any questions.

            St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner, who filed a motion in August seeking Johnson's release after an investigation her office conducted with help from the Innocence Project convinced her he was telling the truth, applauded the ruling.

            “Mr. Lamar Johnson. Thank you. You’re free,” she said before the gathered press. 

            Gardner said this is a time for Johnson to spend with his attorneys and family.

             “This is Valentine’s Day and this is historical,” she said.

            The Republican-led state attorney general's office fought to keep Johnson locked up. A spokeswoman for the office, Madeline Sieren, said in an email that the office will take no further action in the case. She again defended the office's push to keep Johnson behind bars.

            “As he stated when he was sworn in, Attorney General (Andrew) Bailey is committed to enforcing the laws as written,” Sieren wrote. “Our office defended the rule of law and worked to uphold the original verdict that a jury of Johnson’s peers deemed to be appropriate based on the facts presented at trial.”

            Johnson's attorneys blasted the state attorney general's office after the hearing, saying it “never stopped claiming Lamar was guilty and was comfortable to have him languish and die in prison.”

            “Yet, when this State’s highest law enforcement office could hide from a courtroom no more, it presented nothing to challenge the overwhelming body of evidence that the circuit attorney and Lamar Johnson had amassed,” they said in a statement.

            Johnson plans to reconnect with his family and enjoy experiences he was denied for most of his adult life while locked up, his lawyers said.

            “While today brings joy, nothing can restore all that the state stole from him. Nothing will give him back the nearly three decades he lost while separated from his daughters and family,” they said. “The evidence that proved his innocence was available at his trial, but it was kept hidden or ignored by those who saw no value in the lives of two young Black men from the South Side.”

            Johnson was convicted of murder for the October 1994 killing of Marcus Boyd, who was shot to death on his front porch by two masked men. Police and prosecutors blamed the killing on a dispute over drug money. Johnson maintained his innocence from the outset, saying he was with his girlfriend miles (kilometers) away when the crime occurred.

            While Johnson was convicted and sentenced to life, a second suspect, Phil Campbell, pleaded guilty to a reduced charge in exchange for a seven-year prison term.

            Johnson testified at a December hearing that he was with his girlfriend on the night of the crime, except for a few minutes when he stepped outside of the home of a friend to sell drugs on a corner several blocks from where the victim was killed.

            Johnson’s girlfriend at the time, Erika Barrow, testified that she was with Johnson that entire night, except for about a five-minute span when he left to make the drug sale. She said the distance between the friend's home and Boyd’s home would have made it impossible for Johnson to get there and back in five minutes.

            The case for Johnson's release was centered around a key witness who recanted his testimony and a prison inmate who says it was he — not Johnson — who joined Campbell in the killing.

            James Howard, 46, is serving a life sentence for murder and several other crimes that happened three years after Boyd was killed. He testified at the hearing that he and Campbell decided to rob Boyd, who owed one of their friends money from the sale of drugs. He also said Johnson wasn't there.

            Howard testified that he shot Boyd in the back of the head and neck, and that Campbell shot Boyd in the side.

            Howard and Campbell years ago signed affidavits admitting to the crime and claiming Johnson was not involved. Campbell has since died.

            James Gregory Elking testified in December that he was on the front porch with Boyd, trying to buy crack cocaine, when the two gunmen wearing black ski masks came around the house and began the attack. Elking, who later spent several years in prison for bank robbery, initially told police he couldn’t identify the gunmen.

            He agreed to view a lineup anyway. Elking testified that when he was unable to name anyone from the lineup as a shooter, Detective Joseph Nickerson told him, “I know you know who it is,” and urged him to “help get these guys off the street.”

            Saying he felt “bullied” and “pressured,” Elking named Johnson as one of the shooters. Gardner’s office said Elking was also paid at least $4,000 after agreeing to testify.

            “It’s been haunting me,” he said of his role in sending Johnson to prison.

            Nickerson denied coercing Elking. He testified in December that Elking’s identification of Johnson was based on all that he could see of the shooter’s face — his eyes. Johnson has one eye that looks different than the other, Nickerson said. “You can clearly see it.”

            Dwight Warren, who prosecuted Johnson in 1995, said that beyond Elking’s testimony, the main evidence against Johnson was an overheard jail cell conversation. A jailhouse informant, William Mock, told investigators at the time that he heard Campbell and Johnson talking when one of them said, “We should have shot that white boy,” apparently referring to Elking.

            Warren acknowledged that convicting Johnson would have been “iffy” without Mock’s testimony.

            In March 2021, the Missouri Supreme Court denied Johnson’s request for a new trial after then-Attorney General Eric Schmitt’s office argued successfully that Gardner lacked the authority to seek one so many years after the case was adjudicated.

            The case led to the passage of a state law that makes it easier for prosecutors to get new hearings in cases where there is fresh evidence of a wrongful conviction. That law freed another longtime inmate, Kevin Strickland, last year. He had served more than 40 years for a Kansas City triple killing.ST.

            In one Dec. 2022 tweet, deleted as the Algemeiner article was being readied for publication, Cavallaro used language viewed by many Jews as layered with anti-Semitic tropes to accuse House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York, of being in the pocket of pro-Israel lobbyists.

            “Bought. Purchased. Controlled,” Cavallaro wrote alongside a link to an article about Jeffries' donations from AIPAC and other pro-Israel groups.

            State Department spokesman Ned Price said Tuesday that the Biden administration was unaware of Cavallaro's past comments on Israel prior to announcing his candidacy.

            “They are not a reflection of what we believe and they are inappropriate to say the least,” Price said.

            Cavallaro, who served previously on the commission from 2014 to 2017, pushed back at the notion he was being insensitive. He said that his views on Israel are entirely consistent with international human rights organizations and international bodies and in no way would impact his work advancing human rights in the Americas. 

            ““It’s clear I hit a raw nerve,” he said in an interview Tuesday following a meeting with the State Department. 

            He also pointed out that elected commissioners serve in a personal capacity and are not supposed to represent the foreign policy views of the governments backing their candidacy. He said that he discussed with the State Department his active social media presence prior to his candidacy being announced, if not specific tweets, and committed to cleaning up his timeline and rigorously refraining from speaking out if elected to serve on the commission.

            Cavallaro's shortlived candidacy recalls the blow-up over Harvard University's decision to rescind a fellowship that it had offered another human rights activist for similar criticisms of Israel. 

            Kenneth Roth, who was the executive director of Human Rights Watch until last year, was recruited by the Harvard Kennedy School to become a fellow. But the offer was rescinded a few weeks later over what Roth said was HRW's longstanding record of criticizing Israel for possible war crimes against Palestinians. Amid a public outcry over infringement on academic freedom, Harvard reversed course, the offer was reinstated and Roth started the fellowship this month.

            Cavallaro, a co-founder and Executive Director of the University Network for Human Rights who previously taught at Harvard, Stanford and Yale law schools, has also accused Israel of committing “atrocities,” according to the Algemeiner’s scan of Cavallaro’s now deleted social media activity. 

            His candidacy to serve on the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights was to be voted on by the OAS’ 34 member states at a meeting this summer.WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration has withdrawn its pick of a human rights activist for a post at the Organization of American States for calling Israel an “apartheid state” and blasting a top House Democrat as being “Bought.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810435,Pharrell named new Louis Vuitton menswear creative director,"NEW YORK (AP) — Louis Vuitton has named multitalented singer-songwriter-philanthropist Pharrell Williams creative director of its menswear division, replacing the late Virgil Abloh, the company said Tuesday.

            “Pharrell Williams is a visionary whose creative universes expand from music, to art and to fashion — establishing himself as a cultural, global icon over the past 20 years,” the luxury house said in a statement. 

            Word on the appointment first broke in The Wall Street Journal and Le Figaro.











            The “Happy” singer is a 13-time Grammy winner and two-time Oscar nominee with experience working with luxury brands and designers like the late Karl Lagerfeld.

            The appointment is effective immediately. Williams' first collection is scheduled to be shown during Paris Men’s Fashion Week in June.

            The position had been left vacant since November 2021, when Abloh died of cancer at age 41. He was a groundbreaking designer and tastemaker known for merging streetwear and high fashion. 

            Abloh's ubiquitous, consumer-friendly presence in culture was wide-ranging and dynamic. Some compared him to Jeff Koons. Others hailed him as his generation’s Lagerfeld, Chanel's longtime creative director who died in 2019. Abloh was the first Black director of menswear at Louis Vuitton, one of France's most storied fashion houses.

            After Abloh's death, the brand carried on with splashy men's shows, largely without a creative director. Abloh, a DJ and founder of the brand Off-White, turned the job at Louis Vuitton into that of “curator,” rather than simply “designer,” as he expanded his interests into housewares, art, jewelry, industrial design and architecture.

            Williams collaborated with the luxury group LVMH (Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy) in 2004 and 2008. He had a massively popular sneaker collaboration with Chanel in 2017 and a unisex clothing collection in 2019 that he designed with Lagerfeld. He also has his own fashion brands, including Billionaire Boys Club and Icecream.

            “His creative vision beyond fashion will undoubtedly lead Louis Vuitton towards a new and very exciting chapter,” the brand's new chairman and CEO, Pietro Beccari, said in the statement.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810436,Cardinals hire Eagles coordinator Gannon as next coach,"TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) — The Arizona Cardinals hired Philadelphia Eagles defensive coordinator Jonathan Gannon on Tuesday to be their next head coach. 

            Gannon replaces Kliff Kingsbury, who was fired last month after going 4-13 in his fourth season. Gannon becomes Arizona's fourth coach in seven years and the second Eagles coordinator to become a head coach after Shane Steichen was hired by Indianapolis on Tuesday.

            The 40-year-old Gannon has been Philadelphia's defensive coordinator the past two seasons, helping rebuild a defense that helped the Eagles reach the Super Bowl last Sunday. The Eagles lost to Kansas City 38-35 at State Farm Stadium, home of the Cardinals.











            The Eagles had the NFL's No. 2 defense this season and the third-most sacks in NFL history with 78 under Gannon in 2022. Philadelphia led the NFL with 70 sacks this season — 15 more than any other team.

            Gannon's resume took a bit of a hit during the Super Bowl. The Eagles coughed up a 10-point halftime lead and couldn't stop Kansas City's Patrick Mahomes, even though the MVP wasn't moving at his best because of a sprained ankle.

            That hiccup wasn't enough to deter Cardinals owner Michael Bidwill, who is trying to find a leader who can help the franchise win its first NFL championship since 1947.

            Gannon's hiring is the first major move by general manager Monti Ossenfort, who was hired last month after Steve Keim and the team parted ways.

            Gannon inherits a defense spearheaded by Pro Bowl safety Budda Baker and young linebackers Isaiah Simmons and Zaven Collins. Arizona also is potentially looking at a roster overhaul with roughly 30 unrestricted free agents and the retirement of three-time NFL defensive player of the year J.J. Watt.

            The Cardinals also have the No. 3 overall pick in the upcoming draft.

            One of Gannon's first tasks will be connecting with franchise quarterback Kyler Murray, who tore the ACL in his right knee late last season and is expected to miss at least a few games next fall.

            The two-time Pro Bowl selection regressed some during his fourth season, though the former No. 1 overall pick was still productive when healthy. He signed a $230.5 million deal during last year's offseason that could keep him with the franchise through 2028.

            Before being hired by the Eagles, Gannon served as the defensive backs coach for the Colts from 2018-20. He also worked as an assistant defensive backs/quality control coach for the Minnesota Vikings from 2014-17 and held the same position with the Tennessee Titans from 2012-13.

            Gannon began his coaching career as a defensive assistant with the Atlanta Falcons in 2007 and worked as a scout for the Rams from 2009-10. He played defensive back at Louisville in 2002 before sustaining a career-ending hip injury and served as a graduate assistant at his alma mater.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810437,Bellingham back in spotlight ahead of potential transfer,"MANCHESTER, England (AP) — Perhaps no club was happier to see Enzo Fernandez join Chelsea for a British record $131.4 million than Borussia Dortmund.

            The benchmark has been set for prodigiously talented midfielders, and ahead of a summer when Jude Bellingham is expected to be on the market it should drive up the value of the German club's 19-year-old star.

            “He’s a fantastic all-round modern midfield player. He’s got a touch of everything. He plays like a 23-, 24-year-old because of what he’s done at Dortmund and the amount of football he’s played,” former England coach Glenn Hoddle told The Associated Press. “He plays above his age.""











            Dortmund has a habit of selling a rising star every year and Bellingham looks set to be the next one.

            The England international can further enhance his reputation Wednesday when Dortmund hosts Chelsea in a Champions League round-of-16 match that puts him head-to-head against Fernandez.

            Bellingham was one of the standout performers at the World Cup until England was eliminated by France in the quarterfinals. He has suitors from across Europe, with Manchester United, Manchester City and Liverpool all admirers.

            He has also been linked with Real Madrid, while Paris Saint-Germain president Nasser Al-Khelaifi said in December, “Everybody wants him.”

            And while it was Fernandez who commanded a record-breaking move to Chelsea from Benfica during the January transfer window, Dortmund could expect similar offers for Bellingham at the end of the season.

            Dortmund's first leg against Chelsea will be Bellingham’s first game of widespread international interest since the World Cup.

            How he copes with Fernandez is likely to be closely monitored by those readying summer bids.

            The teenager already showed his single-mindedness by resisting United's overtures to join Dortmund in 2020. He was a starter for England at the World Cup in Qatar and has already captained his club.

            “You can’t look at him as inexperienced,” said Hoddle, a BT Sport analyst who will be covering Wednesday's match. “Don’t look at experience by age or grey hairs because you can be experienced but doing the wrong thing all your life.

            “We know he’s technically good, we know he’s got a good engine, he gets forward, can defend, all of those attributes, but for me it’s the mentality that’s the reason why he’s ahead of all these players.”

            Dortmund sold Jadon Sancho to United and Erling Haaland to City in recent seasons. Both clubs are expected to be in the running for Bellingham.

            “He’s already gone abroad, so he’s not scared of going abroad and living abroad, so Real Madrid would be a club that would be very difficult to turn down,” Hoddle said. “If he’s going to come to England for me it would be City or Liverpool where he ends up. Liverpool is an interesting one. I think they need him more than any of the other four clubs at the top (of the Premier League).

            “Whoever goes that extra mile, I think will get him. If he went to Real Madrid, I’d have no qualms about that. I could understand why the kid would do that.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810438,"After nearly upsetting Boebert in 2022, Frisch to run again","DENVER (AP) — Democrat Adam Frisch, who nearly unseated Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert in Colorado's 3rd Congressional District in last year's midterm elections, announced Tuesday he will run against her again in 2024. 

            
                Frisch, a former city council member from the posh skiing town of Aspen, said in a news release that his surprisingly strong showing revealed that “Boebert is weak and will be defeated.”

            He fell short of Boebert by 546 votes in November's election, which had to go to a recount because of the close margin. The thin margin stirred discussion of the far-right Republican's electoral vulnerability after pollsters and pundits thought she was a lock for reelection in the district, which covers the largely rural, conservative-leaning western half the state. 











            In a statement Tuesday, the congresswoman's spokesperson Ben Stout said Boebert “looks forward to continuing to serve Colorado's 3rd Congressional District, regardless of whoever runs against her.” 

            As a freshman lawmaker in the U.S. Capitol, Boebert built a national profile with a pugilistic political style. She most recently helped lead an obstinate group of Republicans who defied the party line and held up Rep. Kevin McCarthy's rise to House speaker.

            In the last election, Frisch targeted Boebert's political style, dubbing it ‘angertainment,' and ran as a Democrat on a largely conservative platform. Frisch, downplaying his party affiliation, often introduced himself as a ‘conservative businessman' hoping to entice disaffected Republicans and build a bipartisan political coalition. 

            He touted using the private sector to work out kinks in health care, promoted some natural gas and oil production in the district and the nation, and supported the removal of Nancy Pelosi as speaker of the House in favor of “the next generation of leaders.” 

            “It was the honor of a lifetime building a coalition of Democrats, Republicans, and unaffiliated voters who rejected Boebert’s extremism with their vote in 2022,” Frisch said in a news release.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810442,"Slain students were 'incredibly loved,' 'tremendous' leaders","EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) — One student was a fraternity chapter president. Another was a science student with fond memories of her days as a high-school athlete — and the third was a frequent volunteer who wanted to become a surgeon.

            Family and friends mourned the deaths of three Michigan State University students killed in a Monday night shooting that critically wounded five others. The 43-year-old gunman fatally shot himself hours later when police, alerted by a tipster who recognized the suspect in photos, confronted him about 5 miles (8 kilometers) away from the East Lansing campus.

            All three students who were killed came from the suburban Detroit area. The names of the five who were injured have not been released.











            Among those killed was Alexandria Verner, a junior from Clawson, whose LinkedIn profile said she was studying integrated biology and anthropology.

            A 2020 graduate of Clawson High School, Verner “was and is incredibly loved by everyone,” district Superintendent Billy Shellenbarger said in a statement Tuesday. “She was a tremendous student, athlete, leader and exemplified kindness every day of her life.

            “If you knew her, you loved her and we will forever remember the lasting impact she has had on all of us,” Shellenbarger said, adding that Verner’s parents, sister and brother were “grieving but are certainly already feeling the uplifting support of this tremendous community. ”

            Verner’s Twitter bio says, “Can’t stop dreaming,” and features photos and videos from Clawson basketball and volleyball games.

            Hundreds of mourners flowed onto a suburban Detroit high school football field Tuesday night to light candles and reminisce about Verner in a vigil led by Shellenbarger.

            Those in attendance also observed a 24-second moment of silence in honor of Verner, who wore jersey No. 24 while she was a basketball player at Clawson High.

            “While you are silent,” Shellenbarger said over the public-address system, “think about her smile, think about that hero that was among us for 20 years.”

            Also killed was Brian Fraser, a sophomore who attended Grosse Pointe South High School.

            Fraser was president of Michigan State's chapter of Phi Delta Theta fraternity, which said in a statement Tuesday that its members were “heartbroken.""

            “Brian was our leader, and we loved him,"" the fraternity said. ""He cared deeply about his Phi Delt brothers, his family, Michigan State University, and Phi Delta Theta. We will greatly miss Brian and mourn his death deeply as our chapter supports each other during this difficult time.”

            University police identified the third victim as Arielle Anderson, a junior who graduated from Grosse Pointe North High School.

            “As much as we loved her, she loved us and others even more,” her family said in a statement. “She was passionate about helping her friends and family, assisting children and serving people.” They described her as “sweet and loving,” with an “infectious smile.”

            Anderson was pushing to graduate early from Michigan State, hoping to become a surgeon as quickly as possible, the statement said.

            “We are absolutely devastated by this heinous act of violence upon her and many other innocent victims,"" her family said.

            Jon Dean, superintendent of the Grosse Pointe schools, mourned the loss of his district's former students in an open letter.

            “I can’t even process what I just wrote,” Dean said. “It is with a great deal of sadness that I bring this news to you and my thoughts go out to the many families that are suffering from another senseless act of violence.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810444,Egypt releases former anti-graft chief after serving 5 years,"CAIRO (AP) — Egyptian authorities Tuesday released the country’s former anti-graft chief after he served a five-year prison term for allegedly insulting and disseminating false news about the military, his lawyers said.

            Hesham Genena, a former judge, walked free from a police station and returned to his home in Cairo’s eastern New Cairo district, lawyer Hossam Lotfy said.

            His daughter, Shorouk Genena, posted images in Facebook showing her father hugging his family. “Baba is out, finally,” she wrote.











            Genena was taken Tuesday to the country’s Supreme State Security Prosecution following his release from a prison, where he was questioned over separate allegations of disseminating false news, said another lawyer Naser Amin.

            The allegations are related to comments he made in 2016 on the scale of government corruption, Amin said. Prosecutors ordered his release pending an investigation, he added.

            Genena, who was arrested in February 2018, served a five-year sentence on a conviction of insulting the military. The conviction was related to incendiary comments in which he claimed that the military's former chief-of-staff, Sami Annan, was in possession of documents incriminating the country’s leadership. He said the documents were kept abroad.

            Annan was arrested shortly after he announced his intention to challenge President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi in the 2018 election. The president won with 97% of the vote in a race that saw no real challenger.

            Annan was sentenced to nine years in prison on charges of fraudulently registering to vote, of breaching regulations, and incitement against the armed forces over a video he released declaring his candidacy. He was released in December 2019 for health reasons, Amin said at the time.

            Genena led Egypt’s top watchdog agency until el-Sissi fired him in 2016 following an investigation that concluded he had misled the public on the scale of government corruption. Genena said corruption had cost the country billions of dollars in 2015 alone. He later said he was misquoted by a local news outlet.

            Genena had long been the target of criticism from pro-government media, well-connected businessmen and senior officials since being appointed in 2012, but his massive corruption allegations sparked a particular furor, with media branding him a traitor and closet supporter of the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood.

            El-Sissi appointed a commission that eventually accused Genena of misleading the public with support from unnamed “foreign” parties.CAIRO (AP) — Egyptian authorities Tuesday released the country’s former anti-graft chief after he served a five-year prison term for allegedly insulting and disseminating false news about the military, his lawyers said.Hesham Genena, a former judge, walked free from a police station and returned to his home in Cairo’s eastern New Cairo district, lawyer Hossam Lotfy said.His daughter, Shorouk Genena, posted images in Facebook showing her father hugging his family. “Baba is out, finally,” she wrote.Genena was taken Tuesday to the country’s Supreme State Security Prosecution following his release from a prison, where he was questioned over separate allegations of disseminating false news, said another lawyer Naser Amin.The allegations are related to comments he made in 2016 on the scale of government corruption, Amin said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810445,"Romania, Moldova both report strange objects in their skies","BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) — Romania briefly scrambled military jets and neighboring Moldova temporarily closed its air space Tuesday after authorities in both countries reported mysterious weather balloon-like objects traversing their skies.

            The incidents occurred at around midday local time and briefly raised concerns in the two Eastern European countries, both which border Ukraine and have been affected by Russia’s war.

            Romania’s defense ministry said it deployed two jets that are under NATO command to its southeastern skies to seek an aerial object it described as being small with “characteristics similar to a weather balloon.” It had been detected initially by radar systems in Romanian airspace at an altitude of about 11,000 meters (36,000 feet).











            “The crews of the two aircraft did not confirm the presence of the aerial target, neither visually nor on the onboard radars,” a ministry statement said, adding that the two MiG-21 LanceR aircraft stayed in the vicinity for about 30 minutes before returning to base.

            Romanian Foreign Minister Bogdan Aurescu told reporters at U.N. headquarters in New York that “the Romanian fighter jets did not find any object, even if it was spotted on the radar … so no threat for the Romanian airspace.” 

            It was unclear whether the two incidents were related, and neither country said where they believed the objects had come from.

            The events follow a string of comparable incidents this month in the U.S., in which objects detected and shot down by warplanes included a high-altitude Chinese balloon that traversed American airspace. China said it was a weather balloon that had accidentally drifted off course.

            The incident in Moldova triggered widespread travel disruption and brief panic when authorities temporarily closed the country's airspace over what they later described as an object “similar to a weather balloon” spotted near the northern border with Ukraine.

            Scores of flights in the country of about 2.6 million people, one of Europe’s poorest, were canceled or rescheduled. Some were diverted to Romania. 

            “Given the weather conditions and the impossibility of monitoring and identifying the object as well as its flight path … the decision was taken to temporarily close the airspace,” Moldova's aviation authority said in a statement.

            Romania has been a NATO member since 2004 and a European Union member since 2007. Moldova is militarily neutral and thus not a potential NATO member. It's looking to forge closer ties with the west and was granted EU candidate status last June, the same day as Ukraine.

            On Monday, Moldovan President Maia Sandu accused Russia of plotting to overthrow her country's government and derail it from its EU accession path.

            Russia’s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova dismissed Sandu’s claims on Tuesday as “absolutely unfounded and unsubstantiated.”BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) — Romania briefly scrambled military jets and neighboring Moldova temporarily closed its air space Tuesday after authorities in both countries reported mysterious weather balloon-like objects traversing their skies.The incidents occurred at around midday local time and briefly raised concerns in the two Eastern European countries, both which border Ukraine and have been affected by Russia’s war.Romania’s defense ministry said it deployed two jets that are under NATO command to its southeastern skies to seek an aerial object it described as being small with “characteristics similar to a weather balloon.” It had been detected initially by radar systems in Romanian airspace at an altitude of about 11,000 meters (36,000 feet).“The crews of the two aircraft did not confirm the presence of the aerial target, neither visually nor on the onboard radars,” a ministry statement said, adding that the two MiG-21 LanceR aircraft stayed in the vicinity for about 30 minutes before returning to base.Romanian Foreign Minister Bogdan Aurescu told reporters at U.N. headquarters in New York that “the Romanian fighter jets did not find any object, even if it was spotted on the radar … so no threat for the Romanian airspace.”It was unclear whether the two incidents were related, and neither country said where they believed the objects had come from.The events follow a string of comparable incidents this month in the U.S., in which objects detected and shot down by warplanes included a high-altitude Chinese balloon that traversed American airspace.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810446,Australia cruises past Bangladesh at Women's T20 World Cup,"CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — Australia legspinner Georgia Wareham made the most of her first international match in more than a year, taking 3-20 as the defending champions eased to victory over Bangladesh by eight wickets at the Women's T20 World Cup on Tuesday.

            Australia joined Sri Lanka with two wins from two in Group 1 and went back to the top on net run rate.

            Wareham, whose last international was in October 2021, was pivotal as Australia limited Bangladesh to 107-7, where only captain Nigar Sultana's 57 from 50 balls stood out.











            The Aussies were untroubled in their chase, cruising to 111-2 in 18.2 overs and led home by captain Meg Lanning, who barely got out of second gear in her 48 not out.

            Opener Alyssa Healy hit 37 from 36 at the top to put the world's top-ranked team on the way to another impressive win. Australia beat New Zealand by a whopping 97 runs in the first game of its title defense.

            Australia is the dominant force in women's cricket and has won five of the seven T20 World Cups and is seeking a third straight title.

            Wareham had a long road back to international cricket after rupturing a ligament in her left knee more than a year ago.

            On her comeback, the 23-year-old spinner picked up the wickets of Sobhana Mostary (7), Shorna Akter (12) and Rumana Ahmed (4) in Bangladesh's middle order as Australia took control and never relinquished it in the first game of the World Cup in Gqeberha, the city formerly known as Port Elizabeth.

            “It’s pretty special any time to play for your country,” Wareham said. “To do that at the World Cup and get a few wickets, it’s pretty cool.”

            India is back in action Wednesday against West Indies and could join England with two wins from two in Group 2.

            India is also expected to be boosted by the return of star batter Smriti Mandhana, who is set to come back into the team after missing the opening win over Pakistan with a finger injury.

            Mandhana is likely to be in good spirits after she was the most expensive player to be bought at the Women's Premier League auction in India on Monday.

            The top two teams from each of the two preliminary groups advance straight to the semifinals of the T20 World Cup. The teams currently in position to progress are Australia, Sri Lanka, England and India.

Australia beat New Zealand by a whopping 97 runs in the first game of its title defense.Australia is the dominant force in women's cricket and has won five of the seven T20 World Cups and is seeking a third straight title.Wareham had a long road back to international cricket after rupturing a ligament in her left knee more than a year ago.On her comeback, the 23-year-old spinner picked up the wickets of Sobhana Mostary (7), Shorna Akter (12) and Rumana Ahmed (4) in Bangladesh's middle order as Australia took control and never relinquished it in the first game of the World Cup in Gqeberha, the city formerly known as Port Elizabeth.“It’s pretty special any time to play for your country,” Wareham said. “To do that at the World Cup and get a few wickets, it’s pretty cool.”India is back in action Wednesday against West Indies and could join England with two wins from two in Group 2.India is also expected to be boosted by the return of star batter Smriti Mandhana, who is set to come back into the team after missing the opening win over Pakistan with a finger injury.Mandhana is likely to be in good spirits after she was the most expensive player to be bought at the Women's Premier League auction in India on Monday.The top two teams from each of the two preliminary groups advance straight to the semifinals of the T20 World Cup.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810447,Prosecutor ousted by DeSantis filing appeal to get job back,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — The elected state prosecutor suspended by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is filing an appeal in his federal lawsuit against the governor in a renewed bid to get his job back.

            Andrew Warren, a twice-elected Democratic state attorney in Hillsborough County, filed a notice of appeal in the case Tuesday, seeking to bring it to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit in Atlanta. 

            DeSantis suspended Warren last year over the prosecutor’s signing of statements that said he would not pursue criminal charges against seekers or providers of abortion or gender transition treatments, as well as policies about not charging people with some minor crimes. 











            The notice of appeal comes a month after a federal judge in Tallahassee dismissed Warren’s lawsuit against DeSantis. 

            In that ruling, U.S. District Judge Robert Hinkle said federal law prevents him from returning Warren to office though a lawsuit that centered on state law, but that DeSantis violated the First Amendment and the Florida Constitution by removing the prosecutor. 

            “The idea that the Governor can get away with breaking federal and state law should offend anyone who believes in freedom — free speech, free elections, and that no one is above the law,” Warren said in a statement Tuesday. “We’ve proven that DeSantis broke the law, and I’ll keep fighting until I’m back doing the work that the people elected me to do.”TALLAHASSEE, Fla.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810454,Peshawar records thrilling 2-run win over Karachi in PSL,"KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) — Babar Azam led Peshawar Zalmi to a two-run win over his former team Karachi Kings on Tuesday in yet another last-over thriller in the Pakistan Super League.

            New Karachi skipper Imad Wasim nearly shepherded a brave run-chase with an unbeaten 80 off 47 balls that included a last-ball six to carry his team to 197-5.

            Babar, who was traded to Peshawar from Karachi for this season’s T20 competition, made 68 but it was Tom Kohler-Cadmore's belligerent 92 off 52 balls that motored Peshawar to 199-5.











            New Zealand’s James Neesham (2-26) picked up two early wickets and Karachi had slumped to 46-4 inside the first seven overs before Wasim and veteran Shoaib Malik (52) combined in a meticulous 131-run stand and raised the home team's hopes.

            Peshawar were scratchy in the field in the death overs when Wahab Riaz dropped a regulation catch of Malik on 38 at wide mid-on and Neesham couldn’t judge a skier of Ben Cutting before the Australian had scored.

            Left-arm fast bowler Riaz (2-34) made amends for his fielding lapse when he had Malik caught behind in the penultimate over and inexperienced fast bowler Khurram Shahzad (0-47) held his nerves in the final over with 16 runs to defend.

            Earlier, Kohler-Cadmore and Babar raised an electrifying 131-run partnership after Peshawar lost two wickets in the second over and stuttered to 16-2. Pakistan international Mir Hamza had Mohammad Haris lbw off a sharp inswinger, and Saim Ayub was run out after Babar’s hard drive flicked the fingers of Hamza’s hand and went onto hit the stumps at the non-striker’s end.

            Kohler-Cadmore showed a lot of aggression against both spin and pace and smashed three consecutive sixes against left-arm spinner Wasim’s (0-42) one over in the batting powerplay. Karachi’s ace fast bowler Mohammad Amir (0-42) also couldn’t get a wicket as Kohler-Cadmore and Babar kept on pushing the scoring rate.

            Babar finally holed out at long-on while going for a big hit against Imran Tahir (1-40) while Kohler-Cadmore was caught at deep backward square leg with three balls left in the innings as he looked for first century in this season’s PSL.

            Defending champions Lahore Qalandars edged Multan Sultans by one run in a sensational opening PSL game on Monday.

            The 2019 winners Quetta Gladiators will open their PSL campaign against Multan on Wednesday.

            The Orange County Register reports Tuesday about 50 performers and stable hands have gone on strike at Medieval Times about 30 miles (48 kilometers) southeast of Los Angeles in Buena Park, California.

            The dinner theater — where audience members feast on chicken with their hands while watching jousts in a ring — has been flying in actors from its other locations to cover staffing gaps, said Erin Zapcic, who plays a queen at the theater and is among those walking off the job since Saturday.











            The actors, who are part of the American Guild of Variety Artists, said the company has blocked efforts to raise wages and improve safety. Julia McCurdie, who also plays a queen, said actors have been injured on the job.

            “I’ve seen a lot of knights get carried away in an ambulance,” McCurdie said. “These people could go work at In-N-Out and make $25 without hurting their bodies.”

            Daniel J. Sobol, the company's lawyer, told the newspaper there were only two meetings with the union before its members went on strike and that the show will go on.

            “We have a team of original Medieval Times knights and squires in place, and we look forward to hosting our guests at our already scheduled performances,” Sobol said in a statement.

Chelsea has drawn its last three games and has only one win in 2023. Dortmund could give a European debut to striker Sébastien Haller, who joined the club from Ajax at the start of the season but didn't play until January because he was undergoing treatment for testicular cancer. However, Dortmund is without forward Youssoufa Moukoko because of an ankle injury.

            CLUB BRUGGE VS. BENFICA

            Brugge has not won a single match at home since coach Scott Parker was appointed at the end of December. The Belgian champions have been struggling domestically after qualifying for the knocking stage of the Champions League for the first time in three decades. That poor run of matches led to the firing of previous coach Carl Hoefkens. Striker Ferran Jutgla and winger Tajon Buchanan are doubtful with injuries for the first leg of Brugge's round of 16 match against Benfica. The Portuguese powerhouse returns to the Champions League without Enzo Fernández following his transfer to Chelsea. Benfica is unbeaten in its last seven games in the Champions League, with four wins and three draws. It will try to win three in a row in the European competition for the first time since the 2005-06 season.

            ENGLAND

            Arsenal and Manchester City — the Premier League's top two — meet for the first time in league play this season with three points separating the teams in an increasingly fascinating tussle for the title. Arsenal is winless in its last two games. It's the first time this season that Mikel Arteta's team has gone back-to-back games without a victory. City, the defending champion seeking a fifth title in the last six seasons, might be sensing that this is the moment to strike. A win at Emirates Stadium would lift City into first place on goal difference though Arsenal has a game in hand. Erling Haaland is a doubt for City after coming off at halftime in the 3-1 win over Aston Villa on Sunday with what manager Pep Guardiola called a “kick.” Leandro Trossard, a scorer off the bench against Brentford, is pushing for a spot in Arsenal's starting lineup at the expense of Gabriel Martinelli.

            SPAIN

            Coming off a trip to Morocco where it won another Club World Cup, Real Madrid hosts last-place Elche in the Spanish league looking to cut Barcelona’s lead to eight points. The defending league champion Madrid has one win from its last three matches in the competition. It lost 1-0 at Mallorca in its last league game. Forward Vinícius Júnior won’t play because of a suspension on accumulation of yellow cards. Coach Carlo Ancelotti said Rodrygo, another Brazilian forward, will replace him. Elche is 12 points from safety but is boosted by its first league win of the season against Villarreal on Saturday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810463,Court to reconsider Connecticut's transgender athlete policy,"HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — A federal appeals court has reinstated a challenge to Connecticut’s policy of allowing transgender girls to compete in girls high school sports, two months after a three-judge panel upheld the rules.

            The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York City said the full court will rehear the appeal of four cisgender runners who said they were unfairly forced to race against transgender athletes in high school competitions.

            The court said in a decision Monday that a majority of its judges voted in favor of rehearing the appeal, a rare move by the court. The court did not say why it voted on whether to rehear the case, and none of the parties to the lawsuit requested a rehearing.











            The court has become more conservative in recent years, with five of its 13 judges — excluding several senior judges — having been appointed by former President Donald Trump.

            Christiana Kiefer, a lawyer with the conservative Alliance Defending Freedom, which represented the four Connecticut cisgender athletes, said the group was pleased by the court's decision.

            “Every woman deserves the respect and dignity that comes with having an equal opportunity to excel and win in athletics, and ADF remains committed to protecting the future of women’s sports,” Kiefer said in a statement.

            Transgender athletes’ ability to compete in sports is the subject of a continuing national debate. Eighteen states have passed laws banning transgender women or girls in sports based on the premise it gives them an unfair competitive advantage.

            The four cisgender runners filed a lawsuit in 2020 against the Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference, the state's high school sports governing body, as well as several local school districts. 

            They sought injunctions to bar enforcement of the state policy on transgender athletes and to remove records set by transgender athletes from the books between 2017 and 2020. They also sought money damages. All the student athletes involved in the lawsuit have since graduated.

            In December, a three-judge panel said the four cisgender athletes lacked standing to sue — in part because their claims that they were deprived of wins, state titles and athletic scholarship opportunities were speculative.

            CIAC officials declined to comment Tuesday. The organization has said its policy is designed to comply with a state law that requires all high school students be treated according to their gender identity. It also said the policy is in accordance with Title IX, the federal law that allows girls equal educational opportunities, including in athletics.

            Two transgender sprinters at the center of the lawsuit — Terry Miller and Andraya Yearwood, from Bloomfield and Cromwell, respectively — frequently outperformed their cisgender competitors. 

            They were defended in the lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union, which said Tuesday that it looked forward to defending the state's policy again. 

            “As the initial ruling found, cisgender girls lose nothing from the participation of transgender girls and Connecticut’s policy simply recognizes the right of all student athletes to equal participation and protection under Title IX,” Joshua Block, an attorney for the ACLU, said in a statement.HARTFORD, Conn.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810464,Judge upholds Maine law allowing older sex abuse lawsuits,"AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) — A state judge on Tuesday upheld a Maine law that eliminated the statute of limitations for child sexual abuse, allowing survivors to pursue lawsuits for sex crimes that happened decades ago.

            An attorney for more than a dozen plaintiffs who have brought civil lawsuits since the law went into effect praised the decision. 

            “Survivors have suffered a lifetime of pain that has affected their relationships at home, at work, and in the world. Now survivors are empowered to face those who allowed such heinous abuse and hold them accountable,” attorney Michael Bigos said in a statement.











            The judge ruled in a motion in the first of the new civil lawsuits, but the decision is expected to be appealed.

            A lawyer for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Portland contended that the 2021 law was unconstitutional because it made retroactive changes that violated both vested rights and due process rights.

            But Justice Thomas McKeon sided with the plaintiff in the case, saying vested rights generally apply to property rights, not statutes of limitations, and that the law can apply to institutions as well as individuals accused of abuse.

            But the judge also wrote that it was a “close case” and that attorneys for the diocese had raised “serious” constitutional concerns. 

            McKeon halted proceedings in the lawsuit until attorneys for the church have an opportunity to appeal to the Maine Supreme Judicial Court. An attorney for the Diocese of Portland didn't immediately return a message seeking comment.

            Maine removed its statute of limitations for childhood sexual abuse cases in 2000, but that change wasn’t retroactive, so victims couldn’t sue for older crimes. Changes to state law in 2021 made it possible for people to seek legal action for older claims that previously expired.

            The diocese unsuccessfully fought against the law. The legislative sponsor said the goal was to give survivors a voice — not big settlements. 

            An attorney for the diocese contended survivors already had ample time to sue and that new litigation could lead to requests for damages in the “tens of millions of dollars.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810465,Man's leap saves him during Brooklyn U-Haul rampage,"NEW YORK (AP) — A 66-year-old man who saved himself from a rampaging U-Haul truck driver with a frantic leap on a Brooklyn sidewalk said he doesn’t know how he managed to escape.

            Mohamed Abdelmagid, a car service driver, was strolling to his dispatch office Monday morning when he looked up from his phone just in time to see the truck barrel onto the sidewalk.

            His reaction was caught on surveillance video — an attempt to sidestep the rushing truck and then a desperate dive to the concrete that sent him to the hospital with cracked ribs and a fractured ankle. The truck passed so close, Abdelmagid said it clipped his foot as he dove.











            Then, the prone Abdelmagid was nearly run over by a police car flying up the sidewalk in pursuit of the U-Haul.

            “I don’t know what happened,” Abdelmagid told The Associated Press by phone Tuesday as he was waiting to be discharged from the hospital. “I go to (the) right. After that I go to (the) left and I jumped.”

            He joked that it was his physical education training from growing up in Egypt that served him well.

            “That’s why I’m still young,” he said. “I’m 66, but I look like 46.”

            Abdelmagid was lucky to survive. The truck, driven by a man with a history of violence and mental illness, hit at least nine people as it wove through the streets of Brooklyn’s Bay Ridge section. 

            One man, age 44, died from a head injury as the truck veered into scooters and cyclists and drove onto sidewalks.

            The man driving the U-Haul, identified by his son as Weng Sor, 62, was arrested after police were able to corner the truck near the entrance to a highway tunnel leading from Brooklyn to Manhattan. Authorities were still considering what charges to file.

            Sor’s son told The Associated Press his father has a history of mental illness and had been living in Las Vegas until recently. According to records, he served time for multiple acts of violence, including stabbing his brother.

            Mayor Eric Adams said the man who died was a single father “raising those children on his own.”

            “Just a terrible tragedy, and I just want to thank the New York City Police Department for taking appropriate actions to apprehend the driver,” the Democrat said Tuesday.

            Abdelmagid is grateful to be alive. He has seen the video of him jumping for his life.

            “I don’t believe it,” he said. “This is me.”NEW YORK (AP) — A 66-year-old man who saved himself from a rampaging U-Haul truck driver with a frantic leap on a Brooklyn sidewalk said he doesn’t know how he managed to escape.Mohamed Abdelmagid, a car service driver, was strolling to his dispatch office Monday morning when he looked up from his phone just in time to see the truck barrel onto the sidewalk.His reaction was caught on surveillance video — an attempt to sidestep the rushing truck and then a desperate dive to the concrete that sent him to the hospital with cracked ribs and a fractured ankle.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810468,"Report: 8,468 perished trying to reach Europe since 2019","CAIRO (AP) — More than 8,400 Europe-bound migrants perished at sea while attempting to cross the Mediterranean over the past four years, a charity said Tuesday. 

            Save the Children said in a report that about a half million people crossed or attempted to cross the Mediterranean to Europe since 2019. Of those, 8,468 people died or went missing in the Mediterranean, the charity added. 

            Analyzing data from the U.N. refugee agency, the charity said deaths at European borders were partly blamed on ""the increasing trend of European governments forcibly, illegally and often violently stopping refugees from entering their territory and even abducting and expelling those who have arrived.”











            The 40-page report cited a 2021 warning by the U.N. refugee agency that “asylum was under attack at Europe’s borders” and that pushbacks were being “carried out in a violent and apparently systematic way.” 

            The report mentioned pushbacks of migrants trying to reach Spain from Morocco; Greece from Turkey; and Italy from Libya and Tunisia.

            Pushbacks are unlawful under international and European Union law, as they violate the right to seek asylum and the legal principle that prohibits the return of anyone to a place where they would risk persecution, torture or deadly threat.

            In its report titled “Safe for Some,"" the charity accused European countries of having “double standards” in dealing with Middle Eastern and African migrants and those who fled Ukraine over the past year.

            Save the Children said over 8 million migrants — 40% of them children — from Ukraine were allowed into Europe since Russia’s invasion of the country last February. 

            “It doesn’t need to be this way,” said Daniel Gorevan, senior advocacy advider at the charity and the report's author. “A new European approach — one which puts the rights of all children at the heart of asylum policies — is possible.”

            Tens of thousands have attempted to cross the Mediterranean to Europe from North African countries that have become hubs for migrants fleeing poverty and wars in Arica and the Middle East, seeking better lives in Europe.

            Libya has been a major transit point for migrants since the country descended into chaos following a NATO-backed uprising toppled and killed longtime leader Moammar Gadhafi in 2011.

            Human traffickers have benefited from the chaos in Libya, smuggling in migrants across the country’s lengthy borders with six nations. The migrants are then packed into ill-equipped rubber boats and other vessels and set off on risky sea voyages.

            European countries have in recent years pushed Libyan authorities and the coast guard to detain and intercept migrants attempting to cross to European shores.

            More than 24,680 were intercepted and returned to Libya, where they were held in detention centers rife with abuses, according to the U.N. migration agency. Such abuses include forced labor, beatings, rapes and torture — practices that amount to crimes against humanity, according to U.N.-commissioned investigators.CAIRO (AP) — More than 8,400 Europe-bound migrants perished at sea while attempting to cross the Mediterranean over the past four years, a charity said Tuesday.Save the Children said in a report that about a half million people crossed or attempted to cross the Mediterranean to Europe since 2019. Of those, 8,468 people died or went missing in the Mediterranean, the charity added.Analyzing data from the U.N. refugee agency, the charity said deaths at European borders were partly blamed on ""the increasing trend of European governments forcibly, illegally and often violently stopping refugees from entering their territory and even abducting and expelling those who have arrived.”The 40-page report cited a 2021 warning by the U.N. refugee agency that “asylum was under attack at Europe’s borders” and that pushbacks were being “carried out in a violent and apparently systematic way.”The report mentioned pushbacks of migrants trying to reach Spain from Morocco; Greece from Turkey; and Italy from Libya and Tunisia.Pushbacks are unlawful under international and European Union law, as they violate the right to seek asylum and the legal principle that prohibits the return of anyone to a place where they would risk persecution, torture or deadly threat.In its report titled “Safe for Some,"" the charity accused European countries of having “double standards” in dealing with Middle Eastern and African migrants and those who fled Ukraine over the past year.Save the Children said over 8 million migrants — 40% of them children — from Ukraine were allowed into Europe since Russia’s invasion of the country last February.“It doesn’t need to be this way,” said Daniel Gorevan, senior advocacy advider at the charity and the report's author. “A new European approach — one which puts the rights of all children at the heart of asylum policies — is possible.”Tens of thousands have attempted to cross the Mediterranean to Europe from North African countries that have become hubs for migrants fleeing poverty and wars in Arica and the Middle East, seeking better lives in Europe.Libya has been a major transit point for migrants since the country descended into chaos following a NATO-backed uprising toppled and killed longtime leader Moammar Gadhafi in 2011.Human traffickers have benefited from the chaos in Libya, smuggling in migrants across the country’s lengthy borders with six nations. The migrants are then packed into ill-equipped rubber boats and other vessels and set off on risky sea voyages.European countries have in recent years pushed Libyan authorities and the coast guard to detain and intercept migrants attempting to cross to European shores.More than 24,680 were intercepted and returned to Libya, where they were held in detention centers rife with abuses, according to the U.N. migration agency. Such abuses include forced labor, beatings, rapes and torture — practices that amount to crimes against humanity, according to U.N.-commissioned investigators.",2023/02/15,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810470,"Walmart to close 3 tech hubs, asks staff to return to office","NEW YORK (AP) — Walmart is closing three tech hubs and asking hundreds of employees to relocate to keep their jobs.

            The closures will affect staff working at locations in Austin, Texas; Carlsbad, California; and Portland, Oregon, Walmart spokesperson Mischa Dunton said Tuesday. Dunton declined to say how many employees will be affected. 

            The company said in a prepared statement that it hopes to relocate or allow remote-work for employees affected by the closures. 











            Dunton described the move as a “location strategy” and said decisions on where to move will be managed individually. Before the closures, the company operated 17 tech hubs worldwide — six of which were based abroad, according to its website. 

            Walmart is also cutting back on remote work and asking its tech teams to plan regular in-office work days. Dunton declined to say how many days tech staff will be required to be in the office. Other corporate staffers were asked to return to the office in late 2021. 

            “Our decision to be together more frequently anchors to Walmart’s fundamental belief that our people make the difference, our culture matters and we build stronger partnerships when we are physically together,” the company said. 

            Walmart is the largest employer in the country, with nearly 1.6 million workers in the U.S. Its technology teams employ 20,000 and grew rapidly during the pandemic. 

            In March of last year, the company, which is based in Bentonville, Arkansas, announced it would hire 5,000 more tech workers and add hubs in Atlanta and Toronto. It laid off 200 corporate staff in the summer after warning consumers had pulled back on discretionary purchases amid high inflation. Dunton said the cuts related to organizational changes. 

            The company said last month it would raise its hourly wages from $12 to $14, a move that will help it attract more front-line workers in a still-tight labor market.NEW YORK (AP) — Walmart is closing three tech hubs and asking hundreds of employees to relocate to keep their jobs.The closures will affect staff working at locations in Austin, Texas; Carlsbad, California; and Portland, Oregon, Walmart spokesperson Mischa Dunton said Tuesday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810471,Sam Bankman-Fried summoned to NYC by judge over bail rules,"NEW YORK (AP) — FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was ordered to return to a New York courtroom this week after the federal judge assigned to his fraud case said he's communicating with others in ways the government can’t monitor. His lawyers, however, say he was merely accessing postseason NFL football games.

            Judge Lewis A. Kaplan on Tuesday scheduled a hearing for Thursday to review Bankman-Fried's bail conditions for the second week in a row. The judge also immediately altered the bail package to ensure Bankman-Fried no longer accesses the internet in ways that can't be traced.

            Bankman-Fried is accused of cheating investors and looting customer deposits on FTX, his cryptocurrency trading platform. It's allegedly one of the biggest frauds in U.S. history.











            Prosecutors notified the judge Monday that Bankman-Fried used a virtual private network, or VPN, to access the internet twice in the last two weeks, including once after last Thursday's hearing, which focused on restricting his communications.

            Prosecutors said in a letter to the judge that a VPN blocks third parties like the government from seeing his online activity, including what websites he visits or what data is sent and received online.

            They noted that defense lawyers had correctly pointed out that many people use VPNs for benign purposes.

            But prosecutors said a VPN can also be used to disguise the use of international cryptocurrency exchanges, to transfer data without detection and to access the dark web.

            On Tuesday, Bankman-Fried's attorneys — Mark Cohen and Christian Everdell — wrote to the judge to say their client will not use the VPN until the questions about it are resolved.

            They defended his use of it, saying he accessed the VPN on Jan. 29 to watch NFL championship games that determine which teams go to the Super Bowl and again on Sunday for the Super Bowl.

            The lawyers said Bankman-Fried's use of the network was not for any of the reasons that the government said were concerns.

            Bankman-Fried, 30, has pleaded not guilty to charges lodged against him in December, when he was brought from the Bahamas to the United States. FTX filed for bankruptcy on Nov. 11 after it ran out of money in the cryptocurrency equivalent of a bank run.

            He has been confined with electronic monitoring to his parents’ home in Palo Alto, California, after his release on a $250 million personal recognizance bond. A trial has been tentatively set for early October.

            Besides cheating investors, he's also charged with using money he stole from investors to finance political donations as well as risky trades at Alameda Research, his cryptocurrency hedge fund trading firm.NEW YORK (AP) — FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was ordered to return to a New York courtroom this week after the federal judge assigned to his fraud case said he's communicating with others in ways the government can’t monitor.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810472,Derek Carr hits open market after release from Raiders,"HENDERSON, Nev. (AP) — Quarterback Derek Carr was released by the Las Vegas Raiders on Tuesday as the club evaluates its future at the position.

            The move was expected after Carr was benched with two games remaining this season because the Raiders would have owed him $40.4 million in guaranteed money over the next two years if he remained on the roster beyond Tuesday. By releasing Carr, the Raiders' salary dead cap hit will be $5.6 million next season.

            “We have a lot of respect for Derek Carr and what he has meant to the Raiders organization for the last nine years,"" Raiders coach Josh McDaniels and general manager Dave Ziegler said in a statement. “Derek has done great things in this league and we’re thankful to have been able to work with him this past year. He is a true professional and we appreciate his hard work in striving to produce the results we all desire.”











            Carr’s agent, Tim Younger, posted on Twitter that they wish the Raiders “the best of luck.”

            “This is the tough part of this business,"" Younger wrote. ""That’s the point; it’s just business. Time now to reset for both sides. Derek chooses to hold on to many good memories and friendships, without any ill will. That’s who he is. Onward and upward.”

            Las Vegas tried to work out a trade with the New Orleans Saints, and Carr visited the team last week. He exercised his no-trade clause and turned down the deal Sunday because Carr didn't want to take a pay reduction, a person with knowledge of the situation said at the time. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to comment publicly.

            Now Carr, who turns 32 on March 28, will see what he's worth on the open market, and there is little doubt there will be interest in the nine-year veteran given how many teams need to upgrade at quarterback.

            Carr might still be able to work out a deal with the Saints, but New Orleans is nearly $60 million over the salary cap, according to overthecap.com. The Saints would need Carr to restructure his contract, but he already turned down that option last weekend.

            Other teams Carr could consider include the Carolina Panthers, Indianapolis Colts, New York Jets, Tampa Bay Buccaneers or Washington Commanders. Another team also could jump into the mix.

            Over nine seasons with the Raiders, Carr became the team's career leader in passing yards (35,222) and touchdown passes (217).

            The knock on Carr was that he led the Raiders to just two playoff appearances and still is looking for his first postseason victory. How much of that was on Carr and how much on the Raiders is debatable, but Carr will have the opportunity to show elsewhere he wasn’t the problem.

            He indicated the week of the Pro Bowl that free agency was his preference over a trade, saying Peyton Manning was encouraging during a discussion they had. The Colts released Manning in 2012 and he went on to win a Super Bowl with the Denver Broncos after the 2015 season.

            “I’m just looking for teams that have made that decision consistently that they’ll do whatever it takes to put a winning program out there,” Carr said Feb. 2. “So for me, that’s just to win, win a championship. That’s at the forefront of the mind. It’s not money.”

            As for the Raiders, Ziegler and McDaniels will have to determine the best path forward at quarterback.

            They could try to land a veteran such as Aaron Rodgers or Jimmy Garoppolo.

            A trade for Rodgers would reunite him with wide receiver Davante Adams and create buzz around the organization, but the Packers likely would demand a lot in return. Sending draft picks and/or players to Green Bay could make it difficult for Raiders management to build around Rodgers and improve on their 6-11 record.

            The San Francisco 49ers have let it be known Garoppolo won’t be back, and he was in the New England Patriots’ organization when Ziegler and McDaniels were there. His injury history would be a concern, but Garoppolo is 40-17 in his career with a Super Bowl appearance.

            Signing a veteran would show the Raiders are trying to win big now, and with a group of targets that includes Adams, Hunter Renfrow and tight end Darren Waller, Las Vegas could be an attractive destination for a veteran. The Raiders also hope to bring back Josh Jacobs, who led the NFL with 1,653 yards rushing.

            Las Vegas could also try to draft its quarterback of the future, and with the No. 7 overall pick, the Raiders might be able to land one of three QBs projected to go in the top 10. The Raiders could even try to move up in the draft to try to secure Alabama’s Bryce Young, Ohio State’s C.J. Stroud or Kentucky’s Will Levis.

It’s not money.”As for the Raiders, Ziegler and McDaniels will have to determine the best path forward at quarterback.They could try to land a veteran such as Aaron Rodgers or Jimmy Garoppolo.A trade for Rodgers would reunite him with wide receiver Davante Adams and create buzz around the organization, but the Packers likely would demand a lot in return. Sending draft picks and/or players to Green Bay could make it difficult for Raiders management to build around Rodgers and improve on their 6-11 record.The San Francisco 49ers have let it be known Garoppolo won’t be back, and he was in the New England Patriots’ organization when Ziegler and McDaniels were there. His injury history would be a concern, but Garoppolo is 40-17 in his career with a Super Bowl appearance.Signing a veteran would show the Raiders are trying to win big now, and with a group of targets that includes Adams, Hunter Renfrow and tight end Darren Waller, Las Vegas could be an attractive destination for a veteran. The Raiders also hope to bring back Josh Jacobs, who led the NFL with 1,653 yards rushing.Las Vegas could also try to draft its quarterback of the future, and with the No. 7 overall pick, the Raiders might be able to land one of three QBs projected to go in the top 10. The Raiders could even try to move up in the draft to try to secure Alabama’s Bryce Young, Ohio State’s C.J. Stroud or Kentucky’s Will Levis.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/02/15,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810474,Brandon Maxwell goes back to basics on Valentine's Day,"NEW YORK (AP) — Brandon Maxwell went back to the basics and hit on the vintage revival trends while challenging silhouettes in his fall/winter collection debut at New York Fashion Week.

            Tuesday’s show was held in an industrial building on Valentine’s Day. Heart-shaped chocolate boxes were laid across the benches before the start of the show, setting the loving atmosphere.

            Maxwell played with neutrals and ’90s silhouettes, really homing in on comfort and versatility while also elevating classic trends like oversized blazers and coats and textured loungewear.











            The opening look was a modern take on suits — the model wore a structured blazer with a matching pair of baggy shorts that were hemmed above the knee. The look was accentuated with gaudy silver cuff bracelets, long black socks and trappy short black mini heels.

            Maxwell stuck with different shades of tan, black, burgundy, brown and white for a subdued but chic ’90s aesthetic that accentuated the tailoring of these effortless clothes. 

            “While the color palette may suggest that it’s dark and the music was quite bombastic, it’s deeply rooted in joy for me,” Maxwell said in a backstage interview.

            One of the best looks from the show was a two-piece cropped suit ensemble with a skinny belt around the waist. Other looks varied from long, slouchy textured knitwear in brown and white, cozy enough to sleep in, and a three-piece leathery burgundy look that hung off the model.

            Celebrities in attendance on Tuesday morning included Lea Michele, Natalia Bryant, Ashley Biden, Bethann Hardison and Huma Abedin.

            During the final walk, the models held hands in solidarity and strutted down the runway together. But then something else happened, too: A handful of Maxwell’s garment sewers also walked out to roaring applause.

            Maxwell said acknowledging the team behind the clothes is important because some members have been part of the brand since the beginning and he’s proud of the work they’ve done together.

            “I think that New York fashion is not just the designers that you see,” he said. So many people behind the scenes “are really the real stars of it.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810475,Ohio derailment aftermath: How worried should people be?,"Plumes of smoke, questions about dead animals, worries about the drinking water. A train derailment in Ohio and subsequent burning of some of the hazardous chemicals has people asking: How worried should they be?

            It’s been more than a week since about 50 cars of a freight train derailed in a fiery, mangled mess on the outskirts of East Palestine near the Pennsylvania state line, apparently because of a mechanical issue with a rail car axle. No one was injured in that wreck. But concerns about air quality and the hazardous chemicals on board the train prompted some village residents to leave, and officials later ordered the evacuation of the immediate area as fears grew about a potential explosion of smoldering wreckage.

            Officials seeking to avoid the danger of an uncontrolled blast chose to intentionally release and burn toxic vinyl chloride from five rail cars, sending flames and black smoke again billowing high into the sky. The jarring scene left people questioning the potential health impacts for residents in the area and beyond, even as authorities maintained they were doing their best to protect people.











            In the days since, residents' concerns and questions have only abounded — amplified, in part, by misinformation spreading online. 

            More on what we know: 

            WAS THE CONTROLLED BURN SAFE?

            Vinyl chloride is associated with increased risk of certain cancers, and officials at the time warned burning it would release two concerning gases — hydrogen chloride and phosgene, the latter of which was used as a weapon in World War I. 

            Environmental officials say that monitors detected toxins in the air at the site during the controlled burn and that officials kept people away until that dissipated. They say continuing air monitoring done for the railroad and by government agencies — including testing inside nearly 400 homes — hasn’t detected dangerous levels in the area since residents were allowed to return. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has shared air monitoring results online.

            WHAT ARE THE CONTINUING CONCERNS?

            Even in communities beyond East Palestine, some residents say they worry about long-term effects of even low-grade exposure to contaminants from the site. The village has scheduled a town hall at the local high school Wednesday evening to hear questions from residents, whose concerns have included lingering smells, how to ensure accountability for the cleanup, and what to make of pets and livestock that have appeared ill or died since the derailment.

            The risk to such animals is low, according to the Ohio Department of Agriculture, which recommended that people contact a local veterinarian for any concerns about their livestock or pets’ health. The department hasn’t received any official reports about livestock or pet illnesses or deaths directly related to the incident, though making such a determination would require a necropsy and lab work, ODA said.

            Ohio Health Department Director Bruce Vanderhoff cautioned at a news conference Tuesday that residents who were worried about lingering odors or headaches since the derailment should know that those can be triggered by contaminant levels in the air that are well below what’s unsafe. 

            The derailment also highlighted questions about railroad safety, though federal data show accidents involving hazardous materials at this scale are very rare. Trains were rolling past East Palestine again soon after the evacuation order was lifted. 

            WHAT ABOUT THE GROUND AND WATER? 

            Contaminants from derailed cars spilled into some waterways and were toxic to fish, but officials have said drinking water in the area has remained protected. 

            In addition to vinyl chloride, at least three other substances — butyl acrylate, ethylhexyl acrylate, and ethylene glycol monobutyl ether — were released into the air, soil or water, according to a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency letter putting rail operator Norfolk Southern on notice about its potential liability for cleanup costs. 

            Norfolk Southern's response has included efforts to remove spilled contaminants from the ground surface and nearby streams, as well as air quality monitoring, soil sampling and residential water well surveys, according to its preliminary remediation plan. 

            The Ohio Department of Natural Resources estimates the spill affected more than 7 miles (11.2 kilometers) of streams and killed some 3,500 fish, mostly small ones such as minnows and darters.

            A plume of contaminants that includes butyl acrylate formed in the Ohio River in the first days after the derailment and on Tuesday was flowing slowly, nearing Huntington, West Virginia, Ohio Environmental Protection Agency officials said. 

            The contaminant amounts found so far don't pose a risk for cities that rely on the river for its drinking water and the plume is continuing to be diluted as it moves farther along, the state EPA said. 

            In response, some water companies have shut off their intakes or increased treatment processes as a precaution. 

            ARE SOCIAL MEDIA CLAIMS ABOUT THIS SITUATION ACCURATE?

            As with any developing situation, misinformation and hyperbole have spread online about the derailment in recent days.

            Social media users, for example, falsely claimed that drinking water is contaminated throughout the entire Ohio River basin when many areas in the multistate region are not affected by the chemical release.

            Footage of dark, ominous clouds has also spread with claims it showed East Palestine post-burn, despite the fact that the footage appeared online as early as November 2022.

            As information continues to develop, disinformation experts emphasize that people should exercise caution before sharing unverified claims.

            WHAT MAY HAVE CAUSED THE ACCIDENT?

            Investigators examined the rail car that initiated the derailment and have surveillance video from a home showing “what appears to be a wheel bearing in the final stage of overheat failure moments before the derailment,” the National Transportation Safety Board said Tuesday. Its preliminary report is expected in two weeks.

            Rail operator Norfolk Southern and the NTSB haven’t publicly answered one of the big questions about the Feb. 3 derailment, however: Exactly when was the crew alerted to a mechanical issue with a rail car axle — the suspected cause — and did they respond appropriately?

            A wayside defect detector alerted the crew to a mechanical issue “shortly before the derailment,” and emergency braking was initiated, a National Transportation Safety Board member said that weekend.

            Security video from two businesses in Salem, Ohio, shows the underside of one rail car glowing brightly from an apparent fiery axle, indicating the train might have traveled more than 20 miles (32.1 kilometers) with that malfunction before the derailment, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported. The NTSB says it’s reviewing that video, too.

            Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said on Tuesday that Norfolk Southern had mismanaged the disaster from the outset and that its actions hampered the response from local and state agencies. He also said the company had been unwilling to look at alternatives to intentionally releasing and burning the five cars filled with vinyl chloride. 

            “Prioritizing an accelerated and arbitrary timeline to reopen the rail line injected unnecessary risk and created confusion,” Shapiro said in a letter to Norfolk Southern CEO Alan Shaw. A message seeking comment was left with the company.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810476,"NJ groups fight power plants, wait for environmental law","NEWARK, N.J. (AP) — Residents of largely minority areas in New Jersey are fighting three proposed gas-fired power plants as they wait for the state's environmental justice law — signed with great fanfare nearly three years ago — to take full effect.

            And the waiting is not easy in communities like Newark, where pollution can be part of everyday life.

            Two new gas-fired backup power plants are proposed for the Newark area. Both aim to provide emergency power in the event of severe storms like Superstorm Sandy, which knocked out electricity in 2012, caused nearly a billion gallons of raw sewage to flow into area waterways, and flooded trains and equipment in a rail yard.











            The backup power plants for the Passaic Valley Sewerage Commission's treatment plant in Newark, and for NJ Transit, the state transportation agency in nearby Kearny, are particular targets for residents of Newark's Ironbound neighborhood. 

            That neighborhood suffers from multiple sources of pollution from nearby power plants, an international airport, numerous highways and heavy truck traffic through residential neighborhoods.

            Ironbound ""is already one of the worst polluted neighborhoods in the entire country,” said Maria Lopez-Nuñez, a leader of the Ironbound Community Corporation neighborhood group.

            “The community of Newark has repeatedly voiced that this plant is not wanted, despite the attempts to threaten us with more flooding,"" she said. “We know that this plant won’t stop us from flooding but will guarantee more health issues in our community.”

            On Monday, Newark's mayor and over 20 state lawmakers wrote to Gov. Phil Murphy asking him to reject the proposal in favor of one powered by renewable clean energy.

            “This plant does not symbolize progress, nor does it address the need to strengthen the state’s commitment to remediate the disproportionate pollution minority communities find themselves burdened with,” Mayor Ras Baraka said. 

            Underlying the debate over whether the three projects should be built — and where they should go — is an environmental justice law New Jersey's Democratic governor signed in 2020. The measure is designed to protect already overburdened communities, many of them inhabited largely by minorities, from having to accept additional sources of pollution.

            Murphy called it ""the strongest environmental justice law in the nation.”

            But the law still has not taken full effect, and won't do so for several months, leaving its potential impact on the proposals uncertain.

            Larry Hajna, a spokesman for the state Department of Environmental Protection, said the state developed regulations informed by 18 months of outreach efforts to affected communities and entities that would be regulated by the law. He said the proposed regulations are in their final stages of review.

            “The Murphy administration is committed to furthering the promise of environmental justice for all New Jerseyans, efforts of which include the implementation of the state’s landmark environmental justice law, in addition to other programs that improve conditions and health outcomes for residents in underserved and overburdened communities,” he said.

            The gap between the law's signing and when it may take effect is frustrating to many residents.

            “Newark residents need action, not lip service,"" said Kim Gaddy, founder of Newark's South Ward Environmental Alliance. “Whatever the intentions, PVSC’s plan unavoidably poisons our already too-poisoned lungs and adds to the climate emergency.”

            Residents in and around Newark and Jersey City also have been fighting a proposed backup power station in nearby Kearny, which also was proposed as a storm resiliency project designed to ensure train service during major storms. During a board meeting earlier this month, the agency put off a decision until April 2024.

            Liz Ndoye, a Hoboken activist fighting the plant, said residents are ""calling on Gov. Murphy to fulfill his promise to reverse decades of environmental injustice by stopping NJ Transit’s proposal for a new power plant and instead invest in a clean, renewable alternative.”

            NJ Transit did not respond Tuesday to a request for comment made that day. The Associated Press erroneously reported that the request was made Monday.

            On Wednesday, NJ Transit issued a statement saying it “has re-imagined this project to maximize the project’s renewables and clean energy components” and is awaiting proposals from various companies. The project “will provide uninterrupted power to key segments of our rail system when power to the existing grid is unavailable.” 

            And in Woodbridge, about 22 miles (35 kilometers) south of Newark, the proposed construction of a new gas-fired power plant by a company that already operates one there is drawing opposition from organizations including the local NAACP chapter. That group accuses the DEP of “cutting corners” in its environmental justice review of the proposal.

            “This plant would go against environmental justice,” said Rev. Donna Stewart, the president of the group's chapter in Perth Amboy, next door to Woodbridge. “The NAACP is a civil rights organization, and environmental justice falls under civil rights of our people.”

            Competitive Power Ventures, the Silver Spring, Maryland-based company proposing the plant, did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday. Its website describes the proposal as an upgraded use of an abandoned chemical plant.

He said the proposed regulations are in their final stages of review.“The Murphy administration is committed to furthering the promise of environmental justice for all New Jerseyans, efforts of which include the implementation of the state’s landmark environmental justice law, in addition to other programs that improve conditions and health outcomes for residents in underserved and overburdened communities,” he said.The gap between the law's signing and when it may take effect is frustrating to many residents.“Newark residents need action, not lip service,"" said Kim Gaddy, founder of Newark's South Ward Environmental Alliance. “Whatever the intentions, PVSC’s plan unavoidably poisons our already too-poisoned lungs and adds to the climate emergency.”Residents in and around Newark and Jersey City also have been fighting a proposed backup power station in nearby Kearny, which also was proposed as a storm resiliency project designed to ensure train service during major storms. During a board meeting earlier this month, the agency put off a decision until April 2024.Liz Ndoye, a Hoboken activist fighting the plant, said residents are ""calling on Gov. Murphy to fulfill his promise to reverse decades of environmental injustice by stopping NJ Transit’s proposal for a new power plant and instead invest in a clean, renewable alternative.”NJ Transit did not respond Tuesday to a request for comment made that day. The Associated Press erroneously reported that the request was made Monday.On Wednesday, NJ Transit issued a statement saying it “has re-imagined this project to maximize the project’s renewables and clean energy components” and is awaiting proposals from various companies. The project “will provide uninterrupted power to key segments of our rail system when power to the existing grid is unavailable.”And in Woodbridge, about 22 miles (35 kilometers) south of Newark, the proposed construction of a new gas-fired power plant by a company that already operates one there is drawing opposition from organizations including the local NAACP chapter. That group accuses the DEP of “cutting corners” in its environmental justice review of the proposal.“This plant would go against environmental justice,” said Rev. Donna Stewart, the president of the group's chapter in Perth Amboy, next door to Woodbridge. “The NAACP is a civil rights organization, and environmental justice falls under civil rights of our people.”Competitive Power Ventures, the Silver Spring, Maryland-based company proposing the plant, did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday. Its website describes the proposal as an upgraded use of an abandoned chemical plant.___This story has been corrected to show that the request to NJ Transit was made Tuesday, not Monday.___Follow Wayne Parry on Twitter at www.twitter.com/WayneParryAC",2023/02/16,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810489,"Daytona 500: A rich, storied history on the Fun Coast","DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Daytona Beach became the unofficial ""birthplace of speed” in 1903 when two men argued over who had the fastest horseless carriage and decided things in a race on the white, hardpacked sand along the Atlantic Ocean.

            Since then, the community of 72,000-plus in the heart of Florida's Fun Coast region has become a motorsports mecca, with a long, storied history it shares with nearby Ormond Beach that is filled with thrills, glory and tragedy. 

            STOCK CARS ARRIVE











            The speed competitions along the beach by 1958 had graduated to stock cars, which used a 3.2-mile course that combined both the beach and the city of Daytona. Bill France, then a local mechanic, entered the inaugural race on March 8, 1936, and finished fifth. France dabbled in racing for 10 years, became a promoter and founded NASCAR in 1947. 

            By 1953, France recognized that development was going to make it nearly impossible to continue racing a course that utilized the city and the beach so he began plans on a permanent speedway. He signed a $2.5 million agreement a year later for what he decided would be a 2.5-mile tri-oval circuit with 31-degree banking.

            It was a wildly ambitious plan. 

            “The World Center of Racing” was completed in 1959 and hosted the first Daytona 500 on Feb. 22. A crowd of more than 41,000 watched a field of 59 cars race for a purse of less than $70,000. The finish was so close it took three days to determine Lee Petty had edged Johnny Beauchamp. 

            The Daytona 200 motorcycle race continued to run on the beach until it moved to the speedway in 1961. The next year the venue hosted the inaugural running of the Rolex 24 at Daytona endurance sports car race, which this year launched its hybrid era.

            EARLY HEYDEY

             In 1961, during a pair of Daytona 500 qualifying races, both Lee Petty and his son, Richard Petty, were injured in separate accidents in which both went over the guardrail. Oddly, both incidents happened on Lap 37 of their respective races. Lee Petty suffered serious injuries in the second qualifying race, while Richard Petty suffered minor scrapes and a sprained ankle in the opener. 

            The next year, local star Glenn “Fireball” Roberts finally won a major event in his hometown when he captured his only Daytona 500. 

            The first shortened Daytona 500 came in 1965 when rain gave Fred Lorenzen the victory after 133 of the 200 laps. 

            Mario Andretti earned his only Daytona 500 win in 1967 and became the first open-wheel driver to do so. In 1972, A.J. Foyt joined Andretti in the winner's club by dominating in a car fielded by Wood Brothers. Foyt won his only Daytona 500 by more than two laps. 

            Richard Petty became the first driver to win consecutive Daytona 500s in 1974, while David Pearson that July won a record third consecutive Firecracker 400. 

            In 1976, Pearson and Petty crashed battling for the lead coming out of the fourth turn on the last lap of the Daytona 500. When both cars came to a rest, they had still not crossed the start/finish line. Petty’s car wouldn’t start but Pearson dumped the clutch and kept the car in neutral to slowly cross the finish line to capture the only Daytona 500 of his career. The finish was the slowest under green flag conditions in race history. 

            Janet Guthrie in 1976 became the first female driver to compete in the Daytona 500, and finished 12th. Three years later, the race was televised live for the first time in event history by CBS Sports and Cale Yarborough and Donnie Allison crashed on the final lap while battling for the lead. Yarborough and Allison then began to fight, and Allison's brother, Bobby, joined the brawl. 

            Cale Yarborough in 1984 was the first driver to win the pole at Daytona at more than 200 mph (201.848). In July for the Firecracker 400, President Ronald Reagan was grand marshal and gave the command to start the engines. Reagan witnessed Richard Petty’s historic 200th NASCAR win and it marked the first time a sitting president attended a race.

            The first restrictor-plate Daytona 500 was in 1988 when Bobby Allison held off his son, Davey, in the race’s only father-son, one-two finish. Allison became the oldest Daytona 500 winner, too, at 50 years, two months, 11 days.

            Dale Earnhardt suffered one of the greatest upsets in Daytona 500 history in 1990 when he cut a tire in the third turn of the final lap and Derrike Cope stole the win. In 1998, in his 20th attempt, Earnhardt finally earned his first and only Daytona 500 victory. 

            TRAGEDY STRIKES

            Three years later, Earnhardt was killed in a crash on the final lap of the race The event was won by Michael Waltrip, his first career victory in his 463rd career Cup start. Waltrip was driving for Earnhardt. 

            NASCAR returned to Daytona that July still reeling from Earnhardt's death and the 400-mile night race was won by Dale Earnhardt Jr.. It was his first career Daytona victory and came 11 years to the day that his father got his first NASCAR Cup Series win at Daytona. 

            NEW ERA

            Ryan Newman in 2008 won the 50th running of the Daytona 500, passing Tony Stewart on the last lap and give motorsports titan Roger Penske his first Daytona 500 trophy. 

            Danica Patrick's eighth-place finish in 2013 made her the highest-finishing woman in the Daytona 500 and the first to lead laps under a green flag. 

            Later that year, International Speedway Corp. announced a $400 million renovation to modernize the speedway. The massive project broke ground in July 2013 and the venue was completed in January 2016 for the 54th running of the Rolex 24. The redesign included five expanded and redesigned entrances, while three different concourse levels featured social areas, or “neighborhoods.” 

            In 2019, the speedway hosted its final July Fourth race, ending a long, sporadic tradition as the event was moved to August. From 1959 through 1987, the race ran on July 4 before being moved to the Saturday of the closest weekend to the holiday. It was a daytime race until 1998.

            In 2023, NASCAR marked its 75th anniversary, a year that will be marked with plenty of reflection on the industry's memorable moments, greatest drivers and fantastic finishes. It's the future that seems most exciting. NASCAR will run its first street course race in Chicago, the latest creative jolt to the schedule that has seen a race inside the LA Coliseum each of the last two years. Rappers and athletes and drivers are in the ownership mix and NASCAR is set to negotiate a new TV contract that could dwarf the $8.2 billion deal that ends next year.

            It all kicks off Sunday where it all began another running of the ""Great American Race.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810490,In which Winnie the Pooh stars in an R-rated slasher movie,"NEW YORK (AP) — The Hundred Acre Wood has seen some pretty unsettling things over the years. A honey jar shortage. Rather blustery days. The omnipresent threat of a Heffalump.

            But in “Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey,” a new microbudget R-rated horror film, Pooh wades into far darker territory than even Eeyore could have ever imagined. After 95 years of saying things like “A hug is always the right size,” Pooh — newly freed from copyright — is now violently terrorizing a remote house of young women.

            Countless cherished characters have passed into public domain before, but perhaps never so abruptly and savagely as Pooh.











            Pooh, Piglet, Kanga, Roo, Owl, Eeyore and Christopher Robin all became public domain on January 1 last year when the copyright on A.A. Milne’s 1926 book, “Winnie-the-Pooh,” with illustrations by E.H. Shepard, expired. Just a year later, Pooh and Piglet can now be found on a murderous rampage in nationwide movie theaters — a head-spinning development that's happened faster than a bear could say “Oh, bother.”

            Depending on how you look at it, “Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey” is either a crass way to capitalize on a beloved bear or an ingenious bit of independent filmmaking foresight. Either way, it’s probably a harbinger of what’s to come.

            In the next 10 years, some of the most iconic characters in pop culture — including Bugs Bunny, Batman and Superman — will pass into public domain, or at least their most early incarnations. Some elements of Pooh are still off-limits, like his red shirt, since they apply to later interpretations. Tigger, who debuted in 1928’s “The House at Pooh Corner,” isn’t public until 2024.

            Many have next Jan. 1 circled. That’s when the original version of Mickey Mouse, from “Steamboat Willie,” becomes public domain. It will be open on season on the face of the Walt Disney Co. — or at least that early whistling variety of Mickey.

            Pop culture, as a concept, was born in the 1920s, meaning many of the most indelible — and still very culturally present — works will fall into public domain in the coming years. There will be all kinds of new and unlikely contexts for some of these characters. Some could be wonderful, some schlocky. But “Winnie Pooh: Blood and Honey” may just be a taste of what's in store.

            “When Superman and Batman fall into the public domain, there’s going to be some wild films, I’m sure of it,” says “Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey” writer, director and co-producer Rhys Waterfield. “There’s going to be so many different and cool unique iterations coming off that. I might do one.”

            Though made for less than $100,000, “Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey” will open Friday on some 1,500 screens in North America, an unusually wide release for such a little-funded movie. It’s already made $1 million in Mexico and has many more international territories booked. For Waterfield, a British film producer of direct-to-DVD titles (credits include “Dinosaur Hotel” and “Easter Killing”), it’s already a hit way beyond expectation.

            “I kind of thought this could do a small theatrical run in some places and do quite well commercially,"" says Waterfield. ""But it's blown up way beyond that to a scale that's absolutely insane.”

            In a 2021 tally of media franchises by Statista, Winnie the Pooh, with $80.3 billion in worldwide revenue, tied Mickey Mouse for No. 3, trailing only Pokémon and Hello Kitty. But unlike them, Pooh accounts for a veritable religion for his kind-hearted witticisms and contented spiritual outlook. Pooh is as much a gentle sage as he is a round-tummied toon. When Waterfield realized Pooh was entering public domain, “I had a spark in my eye,” he says.

            Here was much-coveted intellectual property that could sell just about any film. “I’ve never met anyone that doesn’t know who Winnie the Pooh is,” Waterfield said in a recent phone interview speaking from Amsterdam.

            But certainly, not everyone has been so happy about the idea of one of the most benevolent bears turning feral monster. Waterfield says he receives daily messages telling him he's evil, and even some death threats. One person said they were calling the police.

            “You've got to be pretty thick-skinned to do a movie like this,” Waterfield says. “It baffles me. People think making an alternative version of him is somehow infiltrating their mind and destroying their memories. When I get claims that I ruined people’s childhoods, I’m genuinely confused. I just kind of brush it off and carry on making more of them.""

            Waterfield is already planning sequels with Peter Pan, Bambi and many more. (The Felix Salten book “Bambi, A Life in the Woods” also became public domain last year.)

            Jennifer Jenkins, a professor of law and director of Duke's Center for the Study of Public Domain, is used to operating in a relatively quiet and byzantine realm of copyright law and thorny rights issues. She writes an annual Jan. 1 column for “Public Domain Day.” But nothing has caused her phone to ring off the hook quite like “Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey.”

            The movie has clearly touched a nerve; millions have watched its trailer online. (Typical comment: “I can't believe that this movie is real.”) And Jenkins, a firm believer in the long-range benefits of public domain, has been somewhat bemused by the storm kicked up by a movie like “Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey."" She compares public domain issues like these to the way free speech is a right, regardless of whether you agree with what's said.

            “Some uses of public domain material will be welcome to some and disturbing to others,” Jenkins says. ""But I don’t think new content uniformly saps the value of the original work. I have the original books. I adore them. The fact that this slasher film is out there has no effect whatsoever on how I feel about A.A. Milne’s original creation or E.H. Shepard’s pencil sketches.""

            It's worth noting that much of the Disney empire was, itself, built on public domain. “Beauty and the Beast” comes from Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont’s 1756 version of the fairy tale. “Sleeping Beauty” came from Charles Perrault’s 1697 fairy tale. “Aladdin” comes from the folk tale collection “The Book of One Thousand and One Nights.”

            Though Jenkins can't think of too many characters who had such a jarring entry to public domain as Pooh, films like “Pride and Prejudice and Zombies” (2016) and the 2021 book “The Great Gatsby Undead” are reference points.

            “People love adding zombies to public domain works,” says Jenkins.

            To her, “Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey"" may not be the most glorious example of the effects of public domain, but it's part of a process that human creativity depends upon and thrives on. “Blood and Honey” may not make a lasting mark in the Hundred Acre Woods, but something, someday will. Chalk it up to growing pains.

            “The fact that some people may be disturbed or revolted by this particular re-use of some of the characters from Winnie the Pooh doesn’t detract from the value of the public domain,"" says Jenkins. ""This is how people throughout history have created. They’ve always drawn on or been inspired by earlier works. Time will tell with this movie or any other reuse of Winnie the Pooh and Piglet whether movies like this will be rewarded in the marketplace or have any enduring appeal. 

            “My thing is always: Time will tell.”

One person said they were calling the police.“You've got to be pretty thick-skinned to do a movie like this,” Waterfield says. “It baffles me. People think making an alternative version of him is somehow infiltrating their mind and destroying their memories. When I get claims that I ruined people’s childhoods, I’m genuinely confused. I just kind of brush it off and carry on making more of them.""Waterfield is already planning sequels with Peter Pan, Bambi and many more. (The Felix Salten book “Bambi, A Life in the Woods” also became public domain last year.)Jennifer Jenkins, a professor of law and director of Duke's Center for the Study of Public Domain, is used to operating in a relatively quiet and byzantine realm of copyright law and thorny rights issues. She writes an annual Jan. 1 column for “Public Domain Day.” But nothing has caused her phone to ring off the hook quite like “Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey.”The movie has clearly touched a nerve; millions have watched its trailer online. (Typical comment: “I can't believe that this movie is real.”) And Jenkins, a firm believer in the long-range benefits of public domain, has been somewhat bemused by the storm kicked up by a movie like “Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey."" She compares public domain issues like these to the way free speech is a right, regardless of whether you agree with what's said.“Some uses of public domain material will be welcome to some and disturbing to others,” Jenkins says. ""But I don’t think new content uniformly saps the value of the original work. I have the original books. I adore them. The fact that this slasher film is out there has no effect whatsoever on how I feel about A.A. Milne’s original creation or E.H. Shepard’s pencil sketches.""It's worth noting that much of the Disney empire was, itself, built on public domain. “Beauty and the Beast” comes from Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont’s 1756 version of the fairy tale. “Sleeping Beauty” came from Charles Perrault’s 1697 fairy tale. “Aladdin” comes from the folk tale collection “The Book of One Thousand and One Nights.”Though Jenkins can't think of too many characters who had such a jarring entry to public domain as Pooh, films like “Pride and Prejudice and Zombies” (2016) and the 2021 book “The Great Gatsby Undead” are reference points.“People love adding zombies to public domain works,” says Jenkins.To her, “Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey"" may not be the most glorious example of the effects of public domain, but it's part of a process that human creativity depends upon and thrives on. “Blood and Honey” may not make a lasting mark in the Hundred Acre Woods, but something, someday will. Chalk it up to growing pains.“The fact that some people may be disturbed or revolted by this particular re-use of some of the characters from Winnie the Pooh doesn’t detract from the value of the public domain,"" says Jenkins. ""This is how people throughout history have created. They’ve always drawn on or been inspired by earlier works. Time will tell with this movie or any other reuse of Winnie the Pooh and Piglet whether movies like this will be rewarded in the marketplace or have any enduring appeal.“My thing is always: Time will tell.”___Follow AP Film Writer Jake Coyle on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/jakecoyleAP",2023/02/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810491,"Airbnb 4Q profit and revenue rise on bookings, higher rates","DALLAS (AP) — Airbnb said Tuesday it enjoyed a record 2022, including its first annual profit, and it continues to see strong demand for travel carry over into the new year despite economic uncertainty and high inflation.

            The San Francisco-based company said it earned $319 million in the fourth quarter, up from $55 million a year earlier, and $1.89 billion for the full year.

            Spurred by an increase in bookings, fourth-quarter revenue rose 24% from a year earlier.











            The company predicted that first-quarter revenue will be between $1.75 billion and $1.82 billion, which would beat Wall Street expectations. It said more people are considering international trips and going back to cities, which many travelers avoided at the peak of the pandemic.

            “We are already seeing some really strong demand in Q1. No matter what happens in the world, people want to travel” because they are stuck at home more often, CEO Brian Chesky said on a call with analysts. “The office is now Zoom, the mall is now Amazon, the theater is now Netflix.”

            Airbnb outperformed hotels when travel began to recover from pandemic-era lows, as some people seemed to prefer the relative isolation of staying in a house rather than a hotel. Chesky said Airbnb can keep that advantage if it provides value to consumers.

            However, complaints about high cleaning fees and other charges pushed Airbnb to be more upfront about the total price when listings are displayed.

            Chesky said the company began including all fees in advertised prices in December and the change hasn't affect bookings. He said, however, that it could lead to lower average daily rental rates in the short run.

            To take advantage of the rising trend in travel, Airbnb has been expanding its listings by trying to lure more people to post their homes on the platform. The company said that excluding China, it added 900,000 listings last year, pushing its total to 6.6 million. However, that strategy has alienated hosts, who complain about fewer rentals.

            Chief Financial Officer Dave Stephenson said the company tries to strike a balance.

            “If we get too much supply too quickly, then hosts aren't happy because they're not getting enough bookings,” he said. “If we don't get enough supply early enough, then guests are not happy because they don't get the kind of selection they want.”

            Airbnb's fourth-quarter profit worked out to 48 cents per share. That topped the mean forecast of 26 cents per share among analysts surveyed by FactSet. Revenue was $1.9 billion, beating Wall Street's forecast of $1.86 billion.

            Average daily rates fell 1% but rose 5% after excluding currency effects. Cancellation rates remained above 2019 levels, but declined from last year, the company said.

            Airbnb's shares rose about 9% in after-market trading. The stock has been surging: At Tuesday's closing price, the shares had gained 41% this year, compared with an 8% rise in the Standard & Poor's 500 index.DALLAS (AP) — Airbnb said Tuesday it enjoyed a record 2022, including its first annual profit, and it continues to see strong demand for travel carry over into the new year despite economic uncertainty and high inflation.The San Francisco-based company said it earned $319 million in the fourth quarter, up from $55 million a year earlier, and $1.89 billion for the full year.Spurred by an increase in bookings, fourth-quarter revenue rose 24% from a year earlier.The company predicted that first-quarter revenue will be between $1.75 billion and $1.82 billion, which would beat Wall Street expectations.

            Charles appeared emotional as he visited a temporary “Syria House” set up in central London's Trafalgar Square for the Syrian community in the UK to organize vigils and pay their respects to lost relatives. 

            The monarch heard from those grieving for their families back home, including Salah Al-Asmar, who told the king he lost his parents, brother and other relatives to the earthquake in Antakya, Turkey.











            “For seven days, my family were under the rubble. There was no rescue team. No one could support them in this moment. I haven’t been able to sleep for days,"" Al-Asmar said after meeting with Charles.

            “The king was showing his support and was saying, ‘I can’t imagine how hard it has been for you’,"" said Yazan Douedari, who also attended the event. 

            Earlier Tuesday, Charles and Umit Yalcin, Turkey's ambassador to Britain, visited a west London charity organizing shipments of tents, blankets, winter clothes and toiletries to help those left homeless by the quake in Turkey.

            “He said he was deeply sorry, deeply sad, and he will pray for Turkey, for Syria and the people under that devastating earthquake,"" Yalcin told reporters. 

            Charles and his wife, Camilla, the queen consort, have donated to an emergency earthquake appeal jointly organized by British aid groups that has raised more than 74 million pounds ($90 million) in the past few days.Britain's King Charles III met with Turkish and Syrian communities in London on Tuesday, showing support to those sending aid to their homeland and expressing sorrow for those affected by last week's devastating earthquake.Charles appeared emotional as he visited a temporary “Syria House” set up in central London's Trafalgar Square for the Syrian community in the UK to organize vigils and pay their respects to lost relatives.The monarch heard from those grieving for their families back home, including Salah Al-Asmar, who told the king he lost his parents, brother and other relatives to the earthquake in Antakya, Turkey.“For seven days, my family were under the rubble.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810493,MLB's spring training a test run for new rule changes,"SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) — Spring training games might be a little ugly this year, particularly during the first few weeks.

            For Major League Baseball, that's a feature, not a bug. 

            The Grapefruit and Cactus League games in Florida and Arizona over the next month will be used as a petri dish for the sport's rule changes, including a pitch clock, bigger bases and limits to infield shifts. The idea is that the worst kinks will be worked out before opening day on March 30.











            Though there's multiple innovations, one stands above the rest.

            “The pitch timer is — by far — the biggest change that's coming this season,” said MLB executive vice president Morgan Sword said Tuesday. “Frankly, it's probably the biggest change that's been made to baseball in most of our lifetimes.”

            The pitch clock has been tested for a few years at the minor league level. Pitchers will have 15 seconds to deliver their pitch with no runners on base and 20 seconds when runners are on base. There will be 30 seconds between batters and 2 minutes, 15 seconds between innings.

            
                MLB games averaged 3 hours, 4 minutes last season following the introduction of the PitchCom electronic device to signal pitches, down from a record 3:10 in 2021. Sword said MLB's research indicates fans prefer games that are around 2:30.

            The pitch clock's effect on minor league games in 2022 was substantial. Games that used the clock were, on average, 25 minutes shorter than those that did not.

            “Fans want a crisper pace,” Sword said.

            Sword said umpires will be watching for more balks when runners are on base. Some pitchers — particularly relievers — have funky idiosyncrasies in their deliveries and never come to a complete stop before delievering a pitch. That’s technically a balk, but umpires usually let those tics slide.

            A complete stop with no movement becomes more significant because the pitch clock operator turns off the clock once the pitcher’s motion toward the plate begins.

            
                Balks rose to 924 during a 1988 crackdown from 356 the previous year, then declined to 407 in 1989 and 288 in 1990. The total has been under 200 annually since 1989 and was 122 last year.

            Sword said many MLB players who spent time in the minors during 2022 grew to appreciate the clock, even though there was an adjustment period. He said most players needed a few weeks to a month to get used to the changes, which is about the length of spring training's game schedule.

            Sword said the rule changes will be “full go” from the first day of spring training. That might lead to some irritated players and awkward moments during late February's spring training games.

            Former big league pitcher Joe Martinez, who is MLB's vice president for on-field strategy, demonstrated some of the logistics on Tuesday at Talking Stick Field, spring training home of the Arizona Diamondbacks and Colorado Rockies.

            He also detailed some of the technology that will be used to make the new pitch clock system happen, including buzzers for umpires, which vibrate when a pitcher has run out of time.

            Here are some other updates as MLB camps get going in Florida and Arizona.

            __ MLB said it's looking forward to a season without COVID-19 as a main concern. The past three seasons have at least been partially affected by the virus, which shut down spring training during March 2020.

            No fans were allowed to attend games during the shortened 2020 regular season and attendance was severely curtailed at many parks through much of 2021, when the average crowd was 18,901. Last year's average of 26,843 was down 5.3% from 2019's 28,339.

            MLB said it was encouraged by a few trends toward the end of 2022. In September, attendance numbers were the highest they had been since 2014. 

            “We feel like we’ve got a lot of momentum,” said Chris Marinak, MLB's chief operations and strategy officer.

            __ MLB introduced balanced schedule for its 162-game regular season schedule that focuses less on division rivals and more on making sure all teams play against each other every season.

            Teams will play their division rivals 13 times this season as opposed to 19 times under the unbalanced schedule that had been used since 2001. Most of those division games are being shifted to the interleague schedule, which pits teams from the National League against the American League.

            “It brings more teams and more players to more markets,” Marinak said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810494,"Eagles face an offseason of new coaches, free-agent moves","PHILADELPHIA (AP) — The Philadelphia Eagles' makeover is already underway. Only two days after a crushing Super Bowl loss to Kansas City, some Eagles are ready to move on — especially the coaching staff.

            Offensive coordinator Shane Steichen was named head coach of the Indianapolis Colts and defensive coordinator Jonathan Gannon became the man in charge of the Arizona Cardinals on the same day the team — which has 19 free agents — gathered to clean out its lockers.

            Jalen Hurts isn't going anywhere. But the franchise quarterback who threw for 304 yards and a touchdown and ran for 70 yards and three scores against the Chiefs can start talking about a new contract. Just not yet.











            “I kind of dread this,” wide receiver A.J. Brown told Philadelphia reporters inside the locker room. “It’s tough, it’s tough right now.”

            The first order of business for general manager Howie Roseman and coach Nick Sirianni will be replacing Steichen and Gannon. The obvious move would be to elevate quarterback coach Brian Johnson to offensive coordinator with Sirianni perhaps taking back the play-calling duties that he handed to Steichen midway through the 2021 season. On defense, Dennard Wilson has been touted as a potential replacement-in-waiting.

            The main question the Eagles had coming into the season was answered by Hurts' emergence as an MVP finalist and bona fide star quarterback. His contract expires at the end of the 2023 season and the organization has signaled it's ready to talk about a long-term deal.

            Hurts, however, wasn't ready to talk about it to reporters Tuesday.

            “The thing that I’m most focused on is winning and ultimately winning a championship. There will be a day where that conversation can be had, but today isn’t that day,” he said.

            The eventual contract extension could have a trickle-down effect for other free agents in Philadelphia. At the top of the list is cornerback James Bradberry, who signed a one-year contract worth $7.5 million after being released by the Giants last offseason. Bradberry’s expected value on the open market may be too much for an Eagles team already carrying Darius Slay’s $26 million cap hit for 2023.

            
                “I don’t know what they got planning on over there and I didn’t want to ask about it because I just wanted my mind to be on football,” Bradberry told reporters Tuesday when asked if he talked to Roseman about a new deal. “But we’ll talk about it soon.”

            The same could hold true for C.J. Gardner-Johnson, who was acquired during training camp in a trade with the Saints and solidified the middle of the Eagles' defense in the postseason.

            Two franchise defensive stalwarts from Philadelphia’s Super Bowl team in 2017 are also on the list in Fletcher Cox, who had a $14 million price tag this season on a one-year deal, and Brandon Graham, who recorded his first double-digit sacks season in 2022.

            The offensive side of the ball has its share of questions, as well, starting with Jason Kelce, the 35-year-old All-Pro center who has considered retirement the last two years. Kelce said he would give an answer before March about a possible return.

            His colleague, right tackle Lane Johnson, was scheduled to have surgery this week to repair an abdominal injury that he played through during the postseason. Running back Miles Sanders is scheduled to become a free agent after rushing for over 1,200 yards this year — but the Eagles do not have a history of overpaying for running backs since Jeffrey Lurie bought the franchise in 1994. 

            Philadelphia has other avenues to fill holes on the offensive and defensive lines, as well as the secondary. The Eagles have the No. 10 pick in the first round of April’s draft, acquired in a deal swap last year with New Orleans, and the 30th spot.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810495,"Estimated 300,000 Oklahomans to lose Medicaid coverage","OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — Nearly one-quarter of Oklahomans receiving health care through Medicaid, about 300,000 people, will no longer be eligible by the end of this year, mostly because they or a parent earn too much to qualify, state health officials said Tuesday.

            Oklahoma Health Care Authority CEO Kevin Corbett outlined the state's plan to notify people who are losing coverage over the next nine months. Corbett says most of those people, including children, will be phased out because they or a caregiver earn more than 138% of the federal poverty level, which is the income threshold to qualify for the program called SoonerCare in Oklahoma. The threshold translates to about $18,000 a year for an individual or about $39,000 for a family of four. 

            At the start of the pandemic in March 2020, the federal government agreed to allow people to stay on Medicaid even if they started to make more money than usually allowed. That ended in December when Congress passed a bill that included ending the COVID-19 public health emergency.











            Nationwide, millions are expected to be bumped from Medicaid, which provides health care coverage to nearly 80 million low-income people. The federal government also will wind down extra funds given to states for the added enrollees over the next year.

            In Oklahoma, roughly one-third of the population, or 1.3 million people, receive health coverage through Medicaid, said Corbett, who also is Gov. Kevin Stitt's cabinet secretary of health and mental health. He estimated about 300,000 of those recipients would lose coverage, about 60% of whom are adults ages 19 to 64, and the rest being children.

            The first group of people losing coverage will be out of SoonerCare by April 30, and consist of those earning more than the income threshold, who have no children and already have other health coverage, Corbett said. Roughly a month later, more people without children will be cut off, even if they have no other coverage. That group will be limited to people with few or no health care claims over the last six months.

            “We’ve thought long and hard about how to do this with a level of compassion and making sure we don’t impact our most vulnerable,” Corbett said.

            Health officials are hopeful most of those who lose coverage will be able to enroll in a plan through the federal marketplace, which offers tax subsidies to help low- and moderate-income people purchase health insurance. Some who have found jobs may be able to join employer-sponsored plans.OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — Nearly one-quarter of Oklahomans receiving health care through Medicaid, about 300,000 people, will no longer be eligible by the end of this year, mostly because they or a parent earn too much to qualify, state health officials said Tuesday.Oklahoma Health Care Authority CEO Kevin Corbett outlined the state's plan to notify people who are losing coverage over the next nine months. Corbett says most of those people, including children, will be phased out because they or a caregiver earn more than 138% of the federal poverty level, which is the income threshold to qualify for the program called SoonerCare in Oklahoma. The threshold translates to about $18,000 a year for an individual or about $39,000 for a family of four.At the start of the pandemic in March 2020, the federal government agreed to allow people to stay on Medicaid even if they started to make more money than usually allowed.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810496,Tiger Woods returns to golf with the same belief he can win,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Tiger Woods feels good enough to play at Riviera, his first tournament with a cut and without a cart since the British Open last July. He already is looking ahead to the Masters. And yes, he thinks he can win.

            “I would not have put myself out here if I didn't think I could beat these guys,” Woods said Tuesday ahead of the Genesis Invitational, which has attracted 19 of the top 20 players in the world.

            He also is well aware that he has not won since October 2019, and that at age 47 and with more surgeries than major titles (15), time is running out. He knows that. He's just not quite ready to accept it.











            He marvels at how long Tom Brady lasted. He remembers when John Elway retired from the Denver Broncos because his body could no longer recover the way it once did. Golf is not a contact sport, but it has become a young man's game. Only two of the top 10 players in golf are in their 30s. The oldest is Rory McIlroy at 33.

            Woods can play. The question is whether he can compete, whether he can win. He remains at 82 career PGA Tour titles, a record he shares with Sam Snead, who was 67 when he made the cut at a PGA Championship.

            Part of Woods was annoyed that he was celebrated for making the cut in the Masters last year, his first competition since a February 2021 car crash outside Los Angeles shattered bones in his right leg and ankle.

            “I'm there to get a W, OK? So I don't understand that making the cut is a great thing,” Woods said. “If I entered the event, it’s always to get a W. There will come a point in time when my body will not allow me to do that anymore, and it’s probably sooner rather than later. But wrapping my ahead around that transition and being the ambassador role and just trying to be out here with the guys, no, that’s not in my DNA.”

            He played that ambassador role last year at the Genesis Invitational as the tournament host. He also is leading the private player meetings geared toward building a new PGA Tour model of elite tournaments as a response to Saudi-funded LIV Golf.

            His announcement Friday that he was playing led to a scramble for media credentials. The back of the press room in the Riviera clubhouse was lined with some two dozen photographers waiting for him to show up for his news conference.

            Justin Rose watched in December as Woods played with his son at the PNC Championship, riding in a cart. Woods has been saying he can hit all the shots, that it's walking to them that makes it difficult.

            “In terms of the important part of can you hit a golf ball, can you get a ball in the hole, all of that seemed to be really in order,” Rose said. ""But we know that’s definitely not the thing he struggles with, right? It’s obviously the physical side of putting together four rounds of golf. (It's) a really good sign to see him in the field and feeling willing and able to get out here.”

            Woods had planned to play in his Hero World Challenge in the Bahamas the first week of December, but in accelerating his practice he developed plantar fasciitis that kept him from walking. He said he still copes with plantar fasciitis, only it has become manageable. The ankle is what gives him problems.

            He prepared for Riviera — and the Masters, and whatever else can follow — with a more graduated practice of hitting golf balls, walking the course until he became tired, and then walking a little more until he could get in 18 holes.

            What to expect? Not even Woods knows.

            Expectations have run the gamut during his incomparable career. He once went two whole months in 2001 without winning, and the cover of a golf magazine said, ""What's wrong with Tiger?"" He went on to win his next three starts, including the Masters.

            Now it's whether he's kidding himself about winning.

            Woods no longer is motivated by naysayers, a product of age and maturity, with a dose of reality. He knows his last win was the Zozo Championship in Japan in 2019, which was six months after he won the Masters.

            Before his back fusion surgery in 2017, when it was a struggle just to walk, Woods had reason to wonder if he would ever play. He thinks he can beat McIlroy and Scottie Scheffler, the new No. 1 in golf. But there is more gratitude about simply playing.

            “Those back operations were tough,” he said. “That proved to myself more than anything that I could still do it. ... Ultimately, it's within me and whether or not I believe I can do it. It's not the motivating factor of outside.”

            As for the rest of the year, Woods only knows it will be a limited schedule of the majors and maybe a few more. That's a good forecast. He was at Los Angeles Country Club on Monday riding around in a cart to look at the North course ahead of the U.S. Open.

            The end is sooner rather than later, but it's not now.

            MAUI AHUNA, TENNESSEE

            One of the top defensive shortstops in the country steps into the spotlight after playing his first two seasons for a Kansas team at the bottom of the Big 12. He batted .357 with 75 runs scored, 27 doubles, seven triples, nine homers, 73 RBIs and 21 steals in 103 games for the Jayhawks.











            ENRIQUE BRADFORD, VANDERBILT

            The most exciting player in college baseball stole 46 bases without getting caught last season and is 93 for 96 in his career. The Commodores’ leadoff man batted .317 with eight homers and 36 RBIs and an SEC-leading five triples.

            MICHAEL CARICO, DAVIDSON

            Carico led the country with a .559 on-base percentage, set set a school record with 21 home runs and was Davidson’s first Atlantic 10 player of the year. The catcher also slugged .843, scored 71 runs and had 43 extra-base hits.

            DYLAN CREWS, LSU

            He's the face of college baseball in 2023 and on track to be the No. 1 pick in the MLB draft in July. He was LSU's first SEC player of the year since 2012 after batting .349 with 11 doubles, four triples, 22 homers and 72 RBIs. His home run total was LSU's highest since 2009. He made on error in 175 chances.

            CHASE DOLLANDER, TENNESSEE

            Dollander is considered the best pitching prospect in years and figures to be a top-five draft pick after his dominant first season with the Volunteers following his transfer from Georgia Southern. He went 10-0, led the country with a 0.80 WHIP, had an SEC-0best 2.39 ERA and struck out 108 in 79 innings.

            WYATT LANGFORD, FLORIDA

            Langford turned in one of the best offensive seasons in program history while starting all 66 games in left field. He led the SEC and tied Matt LaPorta’s school record with 26 homers, batted .355, scored 73 runs and drove in 63. He also was error-free in 125 total chances.

            PAUL SKENES, LSU

            The big right-hander won 10 games and hit 13 homers on his way to winning the John Olerud Two-Way Player of the Year for Air Force. Skenes left the academy to pursue pro baseball. He already has established himself as the Tigers’ Friday night starter. He can play the field, but Tigers probably will use him as a DH.

            CAM SMITH, FLORIDA STATE

            The 6-foot-3, 221-pound freshman projects as the Seminoles’ third baseman after being ranked the No. 1 shortstop in Florida and No. 53 overall prospect nationally by Perfect Game. He batted .435 with 18 extra-base hits as a senior at Palm Beach (Florida) Central.

            GAVIN TURLEY, OREGON STATE

            Keep an eye on this freshman, who elected to go to school after the Arizona Diamondbacks drafted him in the 19th round last year. D1Baseball.com projects Turley as the Beavers’ opening day right fielder and future center fielder. He hit 15 homers in 33 games as a senior at Hamilton High in Chandler, Arizona.

            JACOB WILSON, GRAND CANYON

            Wilson has quietly developed into one of the nation's best shortstops playing in the Western Athletic Conference. He batted .358, was the nation's toughest player to strike out (7 in 246 at-bats) and had 11 games with at least three hits.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810498,Milan tops Tottenham for winning return to CL knockout stage,"MILAN (AP) — An early goal was enough for troubled AC Milan to edge Tottenham 1-0 on Tuesday in its first Champions League knockout match in nearly 10 years.

            Brahim Díaz netted in the seventh minute to give Milan a slender advantage to take to London when the teams meet again in the second leg of the round of 16 on March 8.

            But the Rossoneri could be left counting the cost of two late missed opportunities that their coach thought were going to end up in the back of the net.











            “The two chances for Charles (De Ketelaere) and Malick (Thiaw) were important, I was already celebrating on the bench,” Milan coach Stefano Pioli said. ""2-0 would have been a better result clearly because we are sure that the return match will be as close, as difficult.

            “But I can’t be anything but happy with the team’s performance today.”

            It was a miserable return to San Siro for Tottenham manager Antonio Conte, who endured only his second loss against Milan in 15 matches as coach. The former Inter Milan and Juventus coach had engineered 10 victories over the Rossoneri.

            “I’m not disappointed with the performance,” Conte said. ""Some of the players need to find their belief again. But there was a lot of commitment and desire from them all. My job is to show the players that I have a lot of belief in them.”

            It was also Tottenham’s second straight defeat since Conte returned to the dugout following gallbladder surgery. Spurs lost 4-1 at Leicester in the Premier League on Saturday.

            For Milan, it is a further sign that things might be turning around after a tough run. Milan was winless in its past seven matches, including losing its previous four matches, before Friday’s 1-0 win over Torino.

            That run had seen the defending Serie A champion fall 18 points behind league leader Napoli, get knocked out of the Italian Cup and lose the Italian Super Cup to bitter rival Inter.

            “Progressing to the next stage would give our season a lot more sense and positivity,” Pioli said.

            The match at San Siro was Milan’s first in the Champions League knockout stage since 2014. It hasn’t reached the quarterfinals since 2012.

            And the Rossoneri got their return off to the perfect start. Théo Hernandez saw his shot parried by Fraser Forster and Tottenham's goalkeeper then did brilliantly to claw away Diaz’s effort from the rebound but the Milan midfielder bundled in from point-blank range on the second attempt.

            In a tight match, there were few goalscoring opportunities and neither goalkeeper was really tested.

            Ciprian Tătărușanu, who faced criticism during Milan’s dismal run, pulled off a fantastic double save on the stroke of halftime. He did well to deny Son Heung-min then even better to clear the danger after Harry Kane’s follow-up came off the underside of the crossbar. However, it wouldn’t have counted anyway as Son had been offside.

            Milan should have wrapped up the win in the final 12 minutes but first substitute Charles De Ketelaere saw his close-range header cleared by Spurs midfielder Ivan Perišić and shortly afterward Malick Thiaw headed narrowly wide of the left post from six yards out.

            Bayern Munich won 1-0 at Paris Saint-Germain in the night's other Champions League match.

            US inflation slows to 6.4%, but price pressures re-emerge

            WASHINGTON (AP) — The pace of consumer price increases eased again in January compared with a year earlier, the latest sign that the high inflation that has gripped Americans for nearly two years is slowing. At the same time, Tuesday’s consumer price report showed that inflationary pressures in the U.S. economy remain stubborn and are likely to fuel price spikes well into this year. Consumer prices rose 6.4% in January from 12 months earlier, down from 6.5% in December. It was the seventh straight year-over-year slowdown and well below a recent peak of 9.1% in June. On a monthly basis, though, consumer prices increased 0.5% from December to January, much higher than the 0.1% rise from November to December.

            Amid ChatGPT outcry, some teachers invite AI to class

            LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) — The unveiling of ChatGPT has panicked educators around the country who fear students will use the artificial intelligence powered chatbot it to write their essays and cheat on homework. But some teachers are embracing it. They say it’s becoming a tool their students will need in the future. One fifth grade teacher in Lexington, Kentucky, has students compete with what they call “the robot” in writing exercises and work alongside the chatbot to write skits to perform for the class. In Texas, one math teacher says she’s using the chatbot to enhance lessons and infuse them with real world examples.

            Biden, Yellen warn of ‘catastrophe’ if debt limit not raised

            WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen are warning of a potential economic crisis if Congress and the White House fail to raise the federal debt ceiling. They made the remarks during speeches Tuesday at the National Association of Counties. Yellen notified Congress last month that the U.S. Treasury Department has resorted to “extraordinary measures” to avoid default on the nation’s $31.4 trillion borrowing authority. But the extraordinary measures would likely run out — and put the U.S. at risk of default — sometime around early June. House Republicans are demanding spending cuts as a condition for raising the debt limit. Biden wants the limit increased without conditions.

            WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden has named Federal Reserve Vice Chair Lael Brainard as the new director of his National Economic Council. That makes the Ph.D. economist a key point person for coordinating policy, talking with business leaders and negotiating with Congress. Biden has also nominated longtime adviser Jared Bernstein to be chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers. Brainard and Bernstein would be moving into top spots at a crucial juncture for the U.S. economy. Unemployment is near a 54-year low, but inflation remains persistently high and has contributed to fears of a coming recession.

            EPA outlines $27B ‘green bank’ for clean energy projects

            WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration on Tuesday outlined how states and nonprofit groups can apply for $27 billion in funding from a “green bank” that will provide low-cost financing for projects that cut greenhouse gas emissions. The so-called Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, created by Congress in the landmark climate law approved last year, will invest in clean energy projects nationwide, with a focus on low-income and disadvantaged communities. The Environmental Protection Agency expects to award $20 billion in competitive grants to as many as 15 nonprofit groups that will work with local banks and other financial institutions to invest in projects. Another $7 billion will be awarded to states, tribes and municipalities.

            Airbnb 4Q profit and revenue rise on bookings, higher rates

            SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Airbnb has reported fourth-quarter profit and revenue that exceed Wall Street expectations. The company is still riding the recovery in travel from the pandemic-era lows of a couple years ago. Airbnb said Tuesday that it earned $319 million, or 48 cents per share, in the fourth quarter. Thanks to more bookings and higher rates, revenue rose 24% to $1.9 billion. According to a FactSet poll, both the per-share earnings and the revenue topped analysts’ expectations. San Francisco-based Airbnb says it’s seeing strength in all regions of the world. Most of its U.S. business is domestic, but it’s seeing a pickup in cross-border travel too.

            NY court nixes Fox News’ bid to end voting tech firm’s suit

            NEW YORK (AP) — A New York appeals court has rejected Fox News’ bid to shut down a multibillion-dollar defamation lawsuit accusing the network of spreading lies that a voting-technology company helped “steal” the 2020 election from then-U.S. President Donald Trump. A five-judge panel ruled unanimously against the network. Fox News says it was simply reporting the news when it broadcast unsupported — and ultimately false — claims about Smartmatic USA. The company says the network can’t claim free speech protections for inviting guests to circulate damning falsehoods, without evidence. There’s no immediate comment from Fox News or Smartmatic.

            Sam Bankman-Fried summoned to NYC by judge over bail rules

            NEW YORK (AP) — FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried has been ordered to return to a New York courtroom Thursday after the judge assigned to his fraud case said he’s communicating with others in ways the government can’t monitor. Federal Judge Lewis A. Kaplan on Tuesday ordered a hearing for the second week in a row. Prosecutors notified him Monday that the man accused of cheating investors and looting customer deposits on his cryptocurrency trading platform had used a “Virtual Private Network” to access the internet twice in the last two weeks. Prosecutors said the network blocks third parties like the government from seeing his online activity.

Yellen notified Congress last month that the U.S. Treasury Department has resorted to “extraordinary measures” to avoid default on the nation’s $31.4 trillion borrowing authority.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810500,Verlander throws 1st bullpen with Mets; Padres' Tatis in OF,"There were some familiar faces in new places Tuesday as teams picked up the pace on the second day of spring training.

            Justin Verlander threw his first bullpen session for the New York Mets in Port St. Lucie, Florida, six days before he turns 40. Verlander helped Houston win the World Series for the second time in six seasons and won his third AL Cy Young Award before signing an $86.7 million, two-year contract with the free-spending Mets. 

            In Peoria, Arizona, suspended San Diego Padres star Fernando Tatis Jr. went through outfield drills alongside Juan Soto. Manager Bob Melvin said Soto will move from right field to left field, where he started his career with Washington in 2018. That presumably means Tatis, an All-Star at shortstop in 2021, will play right field when his 80-game drug suspension ends April 20, although the Padres haven't committed to that. 











            Verlander agreed to a free agent deal with the Mets in December, replacing Jacob deGrom and reuniting with his former Detroit Tigers teammate and fellow three-time Cy Young Award winner Max Scherzer. 

            Scherzer or Verlander figure to start the March 30 opener at Miami, when baseball gets its first official look at the team that has baseball buzzing after owner Steve Cohen's record spending spree. Verlander and Scherzer were teammates with Detroit from 2010-14, when they each won one Cy Young Award. Scherzer won two NL Cy Youngs with Washington while Verlander went on to win two AL Cy Youngs with Houston.

            “Just like all pitchers, regardless of their background and their success, you’re trying to serve their needs and create an atmosphere that they can be as good as they can be,” manager Buck Showalter said a day ahead of the team's reporting date.

            Verlander was 18-4 with a 1.75 ERA and 185 strikeouts in 2022 and helped the Astros beat Philadelphia in the World Series. 

            The Mets are hoping for a deeper postseason run than last year when, after winning 101 games and finishing behind Atlanta in the NL East, they were eliminated by San Diego in a three-game Wild Card Series.

            Now they'll carry the heavy expectations that come with a record payroll projected at $370 million.

            “Is our season a failure if we win 90 — whatever number you want to come up with?” Showalter said. “It’s about the endgame.”

            Showalter doesn't need to remind his team about last year's disappointment.

            “You don’t talk about it,” Showalter said. “It’s kind of those looks, without saying anything. They know, believe me. Like, who in here likes talking about unpleasant times?”

            LARGE PEPPERONI TO GO

            Boston Red Sox manager Alex Cora put MLB’s new, larger bases in perspective.

            “The bases, they’re the bases. Wait ’til you see them -- they look like a pizza box, to be honest with you,” Cora said in Fort Myers, Florida.

            MLB is increasing the bases from 15 square inches to 18 square inches in the interest of safety and more stolen base attempts.

            ZERO IS IN IN NEW YORK 

            New York Yankees right-hander Domingo Germán is on track to become the third player in team history to wear No. 0.

            The team released its spring training roster on Tuesday night and Germán is listed as 0 after wearing No. 55 from 2019 through last year. Adam Ottavino and Jordy Mercer are the only two Yankees to use the number in a regular season game.

            Ottavino is wearing No. 0 this year for the crosstown New York Mets.

            Nos. 1 through 9 are retired by the Yankees.

            PADRES OUTFIELD

            Soto, who came over from Washington in an Aug. 2 trade, will be moving back to left field after playing right field the last three seasons. 

            “Left is what we’re going to work on with him, and we’re going to try to keep him in that one spot,” Melvin said. The Padres haven't committed to Tatis in right, but that makes the most sense since he has a strong arm and center fielder Trent Grisham is coming off his second Gold Glove Award in three seasons. 

            The Padres don't need to rush into a decision on Tatis since he won't be active until April 20. He's a full participant in spring training after surgery on his troublesome left shoulder in early September, not quite a month after being suspended following a positive test for a performance-enhancing drug. Tatis made 16 starts in right field and seven starts in center field in 2021, when the Padres temporarily moved him from shortstop after he injured his shoulder.

            Tatis missed all of 2022. He was on the cusp of returning from left wrist surgery when he was suspended. 

            “From where he's come from, he just wants to play and contribute and get out on the field,"" Melvin said. ""He does a lot of his damage with the bat in his hand.”

            Xander Bogaerts will play shortstop after signing a $280 million, 11-year deal in December. That pushes Kim Ha-seong to second base and Jake Cronenworth to first. 

            PADRES ADDING WACHA

            Right-hander Michael Wacha has agreed in principle to a contract with the Padres, according to two people with knowledge of the deal. The people spoke with The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because the deal is still being finalized and pending Wacha passing a physical. The addition of the 31-year-old Wacha will allow the Padres to start the season with a six-man rotation.

            CARDS EXTEND MOZELIAK

            The St. Louis Cardinals extended the contract of president of baseball operations John Mozeliak through the 2025 season. Mozeliak is the longest tenured head of baseball operations in the National League. Cardinals chairman Bill DeWitt Jr. had said last month that he was pleased with Mozeliak and wanted to retain him. The Cardinals won the NL Central last year and matched a franchise record with their 15th consecutive winning season.

            RAYS GOOD UP THE MIDDLE 

            Tampa Bay manager Kevin Cash said second baseman Brandon Lowe looks ready after being limited to 65 games last season due to a lower back injury. Lowe had 39 homers and 99 RBIs in 2021,

            “He has gone through the last month of normal batting practice, machine batting practice, just full-go and not having any setbacks,“Cash said. “So we’re really, really encouraged by that.”

            Shortstop Wander Franco also looks good after playing in just 83 games in 2022 due a right quadriceps injury and a broken right hamate bone.

            “Wander is in a good spot,” Cash said. “He’s actually worked really hard this offseason to get his body as lean and probably as flexible as he has ever been. So, good for him.”

            JUDGE CHANGES GLOVE

            Could Yankees outfielder Aaron Judge provide first base depth behind starter Anthony Rizzo?

            Judge worked out at the positiion Tuesday during a pre-spring training workout at the Yankees minor league complex in Tampa, Florida.

            Ace Gerrit Cole arrived and shagged batting practice in right field.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810501,NASCAR 75: France family built US racing at Daytona Beach,"DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) — The France family love affair with racing began when Bill France was a teen willing to skip school to catch events in suburban Washington, D.C. He taught himself mechanics, even tried racing a bit himself. 

            He was supposed to be a businessman, perhaps follow his father into banking. Instead, France opened a garage, got married and had a son, Bill Jr., then packed up his car in the early 1930s and headed South to escape the East Coast winters. 

            “My Dad used to say he moved to Florida to get out of the weather in Washington; he always said, ‘I got tired of shoveling snow,’” Jim France, his youngest son, told The Associated Press. ""He likes to say that the car broke down in Daytona. He was a mechanic. If it had broke down, he’d have fixed it and gone on down to Miami if that’s where he wanted to be.” 











            Nope, France had his sights set on Daytona Beach from the beginning. It was the place to be. Still is.

            
                Bootleggers and mechanics, car enthusiasts and good ol’ boys looking for a good time, they all showed up at the beach to race their stock cars. In 1927, the “world famous Daytona Beach” hosted the world land speed record, 203.79 miles per hour (327.97 kilometres per hour) set by Major Henry Segrave in a Sunbeam Mystery. 

            This was paradise for a young France, who worked at a car dealership as a mechanic and eventually opened a service station on Main Street. He participated in racing as a promoter and grew his business and his family. There was no racing during World War II, and France went to work at the Daytona boatyards building submarine chasers. 

            When the war ended, racing resumed and France wanted something official, bothered by the question: What kind of championship were the racers chasing? 

            France gathered the big players from the local racing scene at the Streamline Hotel in Daytona Beach for the pivotal Feb. 21, 1948, meeting that officially created the National Association for Stock Car Racing, a series that grew into the most popular form of motorsports in U.S. history.

            NASCAR now is celebrating its 75th anniversary, starting with Sunday’s season-opening Daytona 500, and France — a member of NASCAR’s first Hall of Fame class — is regarded as one of the most pivotal figures in domestic racing history long after his death in 1992. 

            It started small – summers were spent in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, running events at Bowman-Gray Stadium, with France’s wife ensuring the books remained balanced and the racers got paid. It’s now an entire ecosystem that spans generations, and NASCAR is the only thing they’ve ever known. 

            “When I was a kid, my dad used to be gone all the time, and I didn’t really understand,” Len Wood, son of Hall of Famer Glenn Wood, told The AP. “He would come home from Daytona with trophies and grapefruits and oranges. Well, where’s he been? They said he’d been racing.” 

            Len and his brother Eddie now run The Wood Brothers Racing team, which entered its first race in 1953. The team has always competed with the Ford badge. The Woods have never left Stuart, Virginia, just a short drive from historic Martinsville Speedway, and nobody has any idea what they’d do if not for NASCAR. The brothers got paid $1 an hour to sweep the shop as kids; Eddie spent nine months washing dishes at a hospital, but back to NASCAR he returned. 

            “We’re in our 73rd year, still with the France family, still getting goosebumps at the start of every race,"" Len Wood said. ""It’s a complete life. We know nothing else.” 

            NASCAR, as it grew beyond the beach and exploded in popularity, now races on 38 weekends from upstate New York to California. The bulk of the competitors are based in North Carolina, a state full of universities offering motorsports management or engineering programs tailored for racing. 

            NASCAR's footprint has expanded in North Carolina to two offices and its glistening NASCAR headquarters in Daytona Beach is LEED Gold certified with a balcony view inside of Daytona International Speedway. 

            The Daytona offices are part of “One Daytona” a 390,000-square foot entertainment and restaurant space in which NASCAR, primarily behind France granddaughter Lesa France Kennedy, donated $107 million to the attraction that has revitalized the beach town. 

            One Daytona sits across from the famous speedway, which the France family also built and then spent $400 million on a renovation completed in 2016. All 105,000 seats for Sunday’s race have been sold. 

            “I tend to think, ‘No, the France family is not appreciated,’ but I think part of that is their style,” said Steve Phelps, just the third non-France family member to serve as NASCAR president in 75 years.

            “They are not flashy. They are not headline grabbers. But if you look at the history of what they have done for Daytona Beach, and what they have done for motorsports, they keep it moving. They doubled down on this sport in 2018 when they didn’t have to.”

            Back then, NASCAR was led by absentee CEO Brian France, who succeeded his father, the late Bill France Jr., and is the grandson of NASCAR’s founder. Lesa France Kennedy, his sister, ran International Speedway Corp., the arm of the family that owned racetracks. 

            Few were happy with Brian France’s leadership style, and when he was arrested for driving under the influence in 2018, his family leaned in rather than stepping out of NASCAR. 

            The sport is now run by Jim France – “Jimmy” to those who have been around long enough. Born in 1944, NASCAR has existed since Jim France was four. 

            He replaced his nephew as CEO in August 2018, and Lesa France Kennedy merged ISC into NASCAR. Phelps said NASCAR would not have otherwise withstood the pandemic.

            Ben Kennedy, Lesa’s 31-year-old son and the great-grandson of NASCAR’s founder, i s now being groomed to lead the company.

            AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsDAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) — The France family love affair with racing began when Bill France was a teen willing to skip school to catch events in suburban Washington, D.C. He taught himself mechanics, even tried racing a bit himself.He was supposed to be a businessman, perhaps follow his father into banking. Instead, France opened a garage, got married and had a son, Bill Jr., then packed up his car in the early 1930s and headed South to escape the East Coast winters.“My Dad used to say he moved to Florida to get out of the weather in Washington; he always said, ‘I got tired of shoveling snow,’” Jim France, his youngest son, told The Associated Press. ""He likes to say that the car broke down in Daytona. He was a mechanic. If it had broke down, he’d have fixed it and gone on down to Miami if that’s where he wanted to be.”Nope, France had his sights set on Daytona Beach from the beginning. It was the place to be. Still is.Bootleggers and mechanics, car enthusiasts and good ol’ boys looking for a good time, they all showed up at the beach to race their stock cars. In 1927, the “world famous Daytona Beach” hosted the world land speed record, 203.79 miles per hour (327.97 kilometres per hour) set by Major Henry Segrave in a Sunbeam Mystery.This was paradise for a young France, who worked at a car dealership as a mechanic and eventually opened a service station on Main Street. He participated in racing as a promoter and grew his business and his family. There was no racing during World War II, and France went to work at the Daytona boatyards building submarine chasers.When the war ended, racing resumed and France wanted something official, bothered by the question: What kind of championship were the racers chasing?France gathered the big players from the local racing scene at the Streamline Hotel in Daytona Beach for the pivotal Feb. 21, 1948, meeting that officially created the National Association for Stock Car Racing, a series that grew into the most popular form of motorsports in U.S. history.NASCAR now is celebrating its 75th anniversary, starting with Sunday’s season-opening Daytona 500, and France — a member of NASCAR’s first Hall of Fame class — is regarded as one of the most pivotal figures in domestic racing history long after his death in 1992.It started small – summers were spent in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, running events at Bowman-Gray Stadium, with France’s wife ensuring the books remained balanced and the racers got paid. It’s now an entire ecosystem that spans generations, and NASCAR is the only thing they’ve ever known.“When I was a kid, my dad used to be gone all the time, and I didn’t really understand,” Len Wood, son of Hall of Famer Glenn Wood, told The AP. “He would come home from Daytona with trophies and grapefruits and oranges. Well, where’s he been? They said he’d been racing.”Len and his brother Eddie now run The Wood Brothers Racing team, which entered its first race in 1953. The team has always competed with the Ford badge. The Woods have never left Stuart, Virginia, just a short drive from historic Martinsville Speedway, and nobody has any idea what they’d do if not for NASCAR. The brothers got paid $1 an hour to sweep the shop as kids; Eddie spent nine months washing dishes at a hospital, but back to NASCAR he returned.“We’re in our 73rd year, still with the France family, still getting goosebumps at the start of every race,"" Len Wood said. ""It’s a complete life. We know nothing else.”NASCAR, as it grew beyond the beach and exploded in popularity, now races on 38 weekends from upstate New York to California. The bulk of the competitors are based in North Carolina, a state full of universities offering motorsports management or engineering programs tailored for racing.NASCAR's footprint has expanded in North Carolina to two offices and its glistening NASCAR headquarters in Daytona Beach is LEED Gold certified with a balcony view inside of Daytona International Speedway.The Daytona offices are part of “One Daytona” a 390,000-square foot entertainment and restaurant space in which NASCAR, primarily behind France granddaughter Lesa France Kennedy, donated $107 million to the attraction that has revitalized the beach town.One Daytona sits across from the famous speedway, which the France family also built and then spent $400 million on a renovation completed in 2016. All 105,000 seats for Sunday’s race have been sold.“I tend to think, ‘No, the France family is not appreciated,’ but I think part of that is their style,” said Steve Phelps, just the third non-France family member to serve as NASCAR president in 75 years.“They are not flashy. They are not headline grabbers. But if you look at the history of what they have done for Daytona Beach, and what they have done for motorsports, they keep it moving. They doubled down on this sport in 2018 when they didn’t have to.”Back then, NASCAR was led by absentee CEO Brian France, who succeeded his father, the late Bill France Jr., and is the grandson of NASCAR’s founder. Lesa France Kennedy, his sister, ran International Speedway Corp., the arm of the family that owned racetracks.Few were happy with Brian France’s leadership style, and when he was arrested for driving under the influence in 2018, his family leaned in rather than stepping out of NASCAR.The sport is now run by Jim France – “Jimmy” to those who have been around long enough. Born in 1944, NASCAR has existed since Jim France was four.He replaced his nephew as CEO in August 2018, and Lesa France Kennedy merged ISC into NASCAR. Phelps said NASCAR would not have otherwise withstood the pandemic.Ben Kennedy, Lesa’s 31-year-old son and the great-grandson of NASCAR’s founder, i s now being groomed to lead the company. He’s the architect of overhauled recent Cup schedules, took the exhibition Busch Light preseason Clash to the Coliseum in Los Angeles, and this year hopes to pull off NASCAR’s first street course race when the stock cars go to downtown Chicago.But first comes the Daytona 500, the 65th running of “The Great American Race” and NASCAR's biggest event of the year.

            Milford, Connecticut-based Subway has been privately owned since its founding in 1965. It’s now one of the world’s largest restaurant chains, with 37,000 outlets in more than 100 countries.

            In a statement posted on its website, Subway said there is no timetable for a sale or even assurance that a sale will go through. J.P. Morgan is advising the company and will conduct the sale exploration process.











            Subway has been losing market share in recent years to fast-growing rivals like Panera and Firehouse Subs, which feature more varied menus and newer stores. Subway took notice, and began a program to modernize its stores in 2017. In 2021, it refreshed its menu and upgraded ingredients; last year it introduced a line of chef-developed sandwiches.

            Subway said 2022 was a record year for the brand, which has now posted eight consecutive quarters of same-store sales growth.Subway said Tuesday that it's exploring a possible sale of the sandwich company.Milford, Connecticut-based Subway has been privately owned since its founding in 1965.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810503,"Healthy, happy Gragson eager to win in debut for Johnson","DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Noah Gragson shotgunned his beer in a NASCAR victory celebration at Martinsville and chucked the empty can into the stands. This is the same driver who admits his gut felt like junk last season because he binged White Claws every day for weeks during the pandemic. 

            He blamed the lingering effects of the booze as a reason why he puked at times last season while still behind the wheel. NASCAR’s good-times guy also once used the tip of a Gladiator sword gifted to the Bristol winner to pierce open yet another beer can.

            So it might seem his new boss -- a driver with a bit of a tame reputation in victory lane -- could suggest to Gragson he cool it on the sword-swinging, beer-chugging, hold-your-breath-until-you-vomit ways as he starts his first full season in the Cup Series.











            Jimmie Johnson’s advice to the Legacy Motor Club driver ahead of Sunday's Daytona 500 was simple: “Be you, man.”

            “He’s like, ‘I’m vanilla during my time and that’s just who I was,’” Gragson said of his conversation with the seven-time NASCAR champion. “'You’ve got to be you and I really think you’ve got a bright future ahead of you if you keep everything going. We haven’t really seen anything like you from the personality side.' He doesn’t want to hold me back from that. I’m going continue to be myself and have fun.”

            The 24-year-old Gragson, though, is keen on making serious changes without surrendering all the fun.

            The pivotal adjustment is the full-time ride in Cup this season after he made 18 starts a year ago, including five for Hendrick Motorsports and the injured Alex Bowman, before he signed with what was Petty GMS Racing. Johnson came aboard in the offseason and rebranded the team. His arrival brought instant credibility to the longtime middling organization and Johnson became a fast mentor to both Gragson and 26-year-old driver Erik Jones.

            Johnson took the team in January to New York for a news conference, nice meals out and a little sightseeing. The trio even recreated the Beatles’ “Abbey Road” album cover — only trading the zebra crossing in London for New York.

            The trip helped the 47-year-old Johnson — who will try to qualify for the Daytona 500 after a two-season dalliance in IndyCar — get to know Gragson beyond his gregarious personality.

            “I am really impressed with his commitment to going racing,” Johnson said. “I know from watching on television, he has a big personality. I didn’t realize his attention to detail. Truly a student of the sport.”

            Wins help, too.

            Gragson won eight times last season in the Xfinity Series and 13 times overall over the last three seasons. He had one top-five finish in 18 Cup starts that included a 31st-place finish in the Daytona 500. Gragson raced his way into the Daytona 500 last season as an open entry driving for Beard Motorsports. He suffered three failed inspections in qualifying for Beard in 2021 and then wrecked in the Duel. 

            Legacy M.C has a charter and a guaranteed spot in the field Sunday. That should somewhat steel his nerves.

            “I was really nervous last year about making it in just because in 2021 we had a bunch of problems with tech,” Gragson said. “They’re pretty stressful.” 

            Gragson had a troubling habit of throwing up at times after races — sometimes in his car — that he blamed on everything from nerves to alcohol to even holding his breath in the final, frantic laps of a race. So he decided to clean up his act and turn to a more healthy lifestyle. While he’ll never be a fitness freak like Johnson, Gragson gave up his favorite fried foods and snacks and worked more chicken, salmon and other healthier foods into his diet. 

            Gragson said Tuesday he hasn’t had a drink in about two months. He still had just as much fun in the offseason with his buddies at the bar without mood-changing alcoholic drinks.

            “I don’t want to have take a Tums to sleep,” he said. “It doesn’t feel like I’m giving up anything. I’m not saying I’ve cleaned up everything, exactly, but I don’t feel like it’s that hard. You’ve just got to commit to do it.”

            Johnson believed Gragson was serious in his commitment to winning and dumping some bad habits.

            “He can certainly adapt to any situation,"" Johnson said. ""He’s a free spirit. I think that shows through on television. But at the same time, he’s been on pro status, as well. I think he’s good a good ability to balance both sides of it.”

            Still, bills have to be paid and Gragson wore a fast-food hamburger chain hat as part of a racing sponsorship deal. No one said Gragson had to go cold turkey on a hot burger all season. Some things are just better in moderation — except winning.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810504,Mbappé can't save slumping PSG in CL loss to Bayern Munich,"PARIS (AP) — Not even Kylian Mbappé's substitute appearance could end Paris Saint-Germain's slump, as it lost 1-0 at home to Bayern Munich on Tuesday in the first leg of their round-of-16 Champions League clash.

            A third straight loss made it five defeats in 11 games this year for PSG coach Christophe Galtier's team.

            Bayern winger Kingsley Coman volleyed home inside the penalty area from Alphonso Davies’ left-wing cross in the 53rd minute.











            The Paris-raised Coman, who PSG sold to Juventus when he was 18, held his hands up to show he wasn't celebrating scoring against his former club — again.

            “It’s the city where I was born and raised so it was difficult to celebrate here,” Coman said. “Given our performance we could have done more, but at the end it was a bit difficult so we’re satisfied with the win.”

            When Bayern won the last of its six Champions League titles in 2020, it beat PSG 1-0 with Coman heading home the winner.

            
                The World Cup superstar Mbappé made an unexpectedly quick recovery from injury and had two would-be goals disallowed for offside after coming on in the second half.

            “It was difficult, unpredictable. I wasn’t supposed to play but I wanted to play and help my mates. We did everything, we worked night and day to get me some game time,” Mbappé said. “I wanted to (start the game). But sometimes you have to be satisfied with what you can do, and that’s all I could do.""

            The return leg is on March 8.

            PSG was eliminated by Real Madrid in the last 16 last season and may need Mbappé at this best to avoid another early exit.

            “When we have our players ready and we can play our attacking game, they (Bayern) are not comfortable,” Mbappé said. “We have to retain how we finished the game. We saw that we can cause them problems.”

            Mbappé showed no ill effects of the thigh tear he sustained two weeks ago.

            He had a shot saved by Yann Sommer in the 73rd after racing through down the left. Sommer saved Neymar’s follow-up and the ball fell to Mbappé near the line, but he was well offside.

            Mbappé peeled away in delight after volleying Nuno Mendes’ cross from close range with 10 minutes left, but it was chalked off following a quick video review.

            “That’s the new soccer, there’s VAR. If it’s offside, it’s offside, you just have to switch quickly,” Mbappé said. “The important thing is to go over there and qualify, and from what I saw that's possible.”

            Bayern’s defense held firm under some late pressure, although defender Benjamin Pavard received a second yellow card was sent off for a late tackle on Lionel Messi in stoppage time.

            Bayern immediately generated pressure from the start against a nervous-looking PSG by closing down high up the field. PSG hadn’t lost three straight games since late 2011, which was only months into the new reign of Qatari owners QSI.

            “Bayern really got on top of us and we struggled to hold the ball high up the pitch. The first half was very difficult for us,” Galtier said. “I knew we could use Kylian in the second half, but unfortunately we conceded this goal just before I was going to bring him on.”

            The dominance of Julian Nagelsmann’s team in midfield was so complete that it forced Messi to drop deep to get the ball, and Neymar was anonymous for most of the match.

            “We were a bit surprised by how much of the ball we had. We didn’t expect Paris to be so passive; it was a good first half,” Nagelsmann said. ""The two times they really threatened it was offside.”

            Midway through the first half, Neymar lay face-first on the field after a shoulder barge from a defender. English referee Michael Oliver waved play on and Sommer — although nearby — didn’t check on Neymar, who at the 2018 World Cup in Russia earned an unwelcome reputation for diving and play-acting.

            Bayern’s possession didn’t lead to clear chances, however, and midfielder Joshua Kimmich’s 20-meter drive was easily captured by goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma in the 43rd.

            Nagelsmann showed shrewd tactical sense by bringing on Davies and switching Coman from the left to the right flank with seamless efficiency. Bayern came close to 2-0 when former PSG striker Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting had a shot tipped onto the post by Donnarumma.

            PSG midfielder Warren Zaïre-Emery became the youngest player to start a Champions League knockout match at the age of 16 years, 343 days.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810506,"With Correa short, Twins prospects not sweating blocked path","MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — When the Minnesota Twins committed at least $200 million and six years to Carlos Correa, outlasting two other teams he initially agreed with, their outlook sure brightened up.

            The path to becoming a major league regular also grew murkier for the organization's top prospects, Brooks Lee and Royce Lewis.

            Correa is entrenched at shortstop for the foreseeable future. That happens to be the natural position for Lee and Lewis. They'll both likely be ready for full-time action long before a switch for Correa would be broached.











            Concern and frustration were the furthest feelings from their minds when they found out Correa was coming back. They were too focused on the excitement of the continued opportunity to learn from one of the game's best leaders.

            “This is my favorite player and someone that's taught me so much in the two months I was able to be with him,” Lewis said recently. “I was glad he signed. I tell people, ‘Dude, this is my friend.’”

            Lewis, the first overall pick in the 2017 amateur draft, made his debut last May 6 after Correa injured his finger. Lewis thrived for 11 games, getting at least one hit in nine of them while recording his first career grand slam and injecting his infectious energy into the lineup and the infield.

            Sent back to Triple-A when Correa returned, Lewis was called up again less than two weeks later to help in the injury-affected outfield. He caught the bug himself just three innings into his second stint, crashing into the center field wall as he made a leaping catch. For the second straight year, Lewis tore the ACL in his right knee. His first such injury delayed his debut and kept him sidelined for the entire 2021 season.

            Lewis likely won't be ready to play again until midsummer, all but certain to start in Triple-A as he returns from yet another long layoff. 

            The Twins will make sure to find room for him, again, once he's cleared. General manager Thad Levine called the 23-year-old Lewis after the Correa signing to assure him as much.

            “He told me I’m a championship-type player and we don’t look at you as just like a shortstop or a certain position. It’s just, ‘You’re a champion, and you’ll play wherever you need to play,'” Lewis said at the team's annual fan festival at Target Field. “And I said, ‘Yeah, absolutely.’”

            The Twins hold their first formal session of spring training for pitchers and catchers on Thursday in Fort Myers, Florida, and their first full-squad workout on Monday.

            “I’d love to be playing tomorrow, but I also know that’s not realistic so we’ll see,” Lewis said. “I’m just kind of here for the ride and just going with the flow for now.”

            Lewis was ranked by MLB as the 45th-best prospect in the game. Lee, the eighth overall pick in the 2022 draft, was pegged 31st. The product of Cal Poly was impressive enough in his pro debut last summer that he finished the season at Double-A Wichita, and he'll be one of the non-roster players in big league camp — closely watching Correa as much as he can.

            “He’s my idol right now. To have him on the field with me and teach me and talk through some things, that’s all I can ask for,” Lee said at TwinsFest on Jan. 28. ""I’m as lucky as anybody is in professional baseball. Right when he re-signed, it was, ‘This was probably the best thing that could have happened to me.’

            Just like Lewis, Lee doesn't consider Correa to be blocking him. Perhaps all three of them will be stationed around the diamond sometime in the future, or one of them finds his way to the outfield.

            “I’ll do whatever the team asks me to do. That’s just the type of player I was made to be. Whatever I need to do, it will be done,” said Lee, who turned 22 on Tuesday. 

            Correa was set to move to third base had his deal with the New York Mets not fallen through. That could eventually happen in Minnesota. For now, he's focused on investing in the development of both Lee and Lewis like he did in Houston with Jeremy Peña, who took over at shortstop as a rookie last year for the World Series champion Astros.

            “When these guys come up to the big leagues, it helps. Eventually if they become superstars, it’s just going to make us better,” Correa said. We draft based on talent, not positions, and their talent is good enough to play anywhere in the infield or the outfield. That excites me.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810509,Advantage Bayern Munich as Kingsley Coman haunts PSG again,"In the 2020 Champions League final in Lisbon, it was Joshua Kimmich who provided the cross from the right. On Tuesday night in Paris, it was Alphonso Davies from the left. But the result was the same: a Kingsley Coman winner for Bayern Munich against Paris Saint-Germain.Three years ago, Coman's header won Bayern a sixth European Cup. The 26-year-old's cushioned right-footed volley against his former club and in the city of his birth on Tuesday didn't have quite the same glorious consequence, but was just cause for celebration nonetheless, putting Bayern in the driving seat at the half-way stage of this last-16 tie.""I was born here and this is my home, so I'm very happy – even if I didn't want to celebrate the goal,"" Coman told broadcaster Amazon post-match. ""If we play like that [in the second leg], and if we have a bit of luck, we'll be on the right path.""Coman's 53rd-minute strike was just reward for Bayern's performance in the preceding first half, which began with an Eric-Maxim Choupo-Moting chance and continued largely with Bavarian dominance.PSG goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma kept the hosts in the tie with a series of top-quality saves in the next ten minutes, tipping a Choupo-Moting drive onto the crossbar and parrying a Benjamin Pavard header from the subsequent corner.Ultimately, however, Bayern will feel fortunate to be leaving the French capital with a first-leg lead after substitute Kylian Mbappé inspired a second-half Parisian powerplay.The 24-year-old was a pre-match doubt after pulling his hamstring earlier this month but was passed fit enough to provide ""a glimmer of light on the bench"" – in the words of French sports newspaper L'Équipe.But his entry just before the hour-mark was more like a bolt of lightning, immediately injecting pace into PSG's attacks and forcing a vital save from Yann Sommer when one-on-one. He then thought he had drawn his team level in the 82nd minute but Nuno Mendes was judged marginally offside in the build-up.""You could feel the euphoria in the stadium when he came on,"" said Bayern's Choupo-Moting of Mbappé. ""He's so fast, technically strong and was immediately dangerous. He's one of the best in the world.""Bayern were reduced to ten men in injury time when Pavard was shown a second yellow for hacking down the otherwise quiet Lionel Messi, but held on.""We were in a wobbly position, it was on a knife-edge,"" admitted head coach Nagelsmann. ""They're not easy opponents, but we've taken the first step, so I'm satisfied.""",2023/02/14,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810510,Pharrell Williams named head of menswear at Louis Vuitton,"Pharrell Williams was appointed the head of menswear at Louis Vuitton Tuesday.In a tweet, the label announced, ""Louis Vuitton is delighted to welcome @Pharrell as its new Men's Creative Director.""Prior to the company's tweet, The Wall Street Journal and French newspaper Le Figaro had both reported the selection was imminent.As head of menswear design at Louis Vuitton he will be taking over after the late Virgil Abloh, who died of cancer in November 2021, at the helm of one of French fashion's most recognizable global luxury brands.Prior to his death, Abloh made history as the first Black head at the fashion house. He brought a signature streetwear style infused with skateboard and youth culture combined with graffiti art and a rough touch of deconstructivism.While Williams had not been rumored to succeed Abloh, his front row spot at fashion shows over the years combined with his pop culture status cemented the selection. His streetwear sensibilities drove the brand to opt for the 49-year-old musical megastar.When Abloh died, Williams wrote: ""Virgil you were a kind, generous, thoughtful creative genius. Your work as a human and your work as a spiritual being will live forever.""Thw new head of Louis Vuitton, Pietro Beccari, praised Williams' ""creative vision beyond fashion,"" and said that he would lead the label ""towards a new and very exciting chapter.""The songwriter, producer and performer has partnered with Louis Vuitton in the past, though that line, which focused solely on jewelry and sunglasses, was 15 years ago. He has previously worked with brands including Adidas, Diesel, Chanel and Moncler.Pharrell became co-owner of the denim brand G-Star Raw in 2016 and co-founded the Billionaire Boys Club brand with Japanese designer Nigo in 2003.His wife is fashion designer Helen Lasichanh. They married in 2013.As a musician, Williams has worked with artists including Daft Punk, Gwen Stefani, Jay-Z, Justin Timberlake, Madonna, Shakira and Snoop Dogg. With Daft Punk the artist responsible for ""Happy"" collaborated on ""Get Lucky"" and ""Lose Yourself to Dance.""The two-time Oscar nominee has won 13 Grammy Awards.His first collection for Louis Vuitton will debut in June during Paris' men's fashion week, the company said.ar/jsi (AFP, Reuters)",2023/02/14,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810511,Moldova bars fans from football match amid coup worries,"Moldova has banned fans from attending a football match against a Serbian team, the country's football authority said on Tuesday, a day after the Moldovan president warned that saboteurs from Serbia could be part of an alleged Kremlin plot to overthrow the government.The Moldovan Football Federation said it was ""informed by the authorities of the Republic of Moldova about the impossibility"" of allowing fans to attend a February 16 match in Chisinau between FC Sheriff of Tiraspol and FK Partizan of Belgrade.UEFA required FC Sheriff to play home games away from Tiraspol, which is about 90 kilometers (55 miles) from the Ukrainian city of Odesa.The federation said in a statement it would allow fans to receive refunds on tickets purchased, but did not give an explanation for the move. ""We apologize to football fans for the inconvenience caused,"" it said.The football federation's decision comes a day after Moldova's President Maia Sandu described an alleged Russian conspiracy against her country's government using external saboteurs from Montenegro, Belarus and Serbia.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said last week that Kyiv had ""intercepted the plan for the destruction of Moldova by Russian intelligence.""Russia's plan aims to derail country's bid to join the European Union and to use its strategic location bordering Ukraine in the war there, Sandu said. Moldova, a country of 2.6 million people neighboring Romania and Ukraine, received EU candidate status in the summer of 2022.Sandu has repeatedly expressed concern about Moscow's intentions towards the former Soviet republic and about the presence of Russian troops in the breakaway Trans-Dniester region, where FC Sheriff is based.Meanwhile, Russia denied ""completely unfounded"" accusations from Moldova that Moscow was plotting to violently overthrow the country's pro-European leadership with the help of saboteurs.""Such claims are completely unfounded and unsubstantiated,"" the Russian Foreign Ministry said.It also accused Kyiv of seeking to pit Moldova against Russia and accused Moldovan authorities of Russophobia.dh/rs (AP, AFP, Reuters)",2023/02/14,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810512,"EU: Commission aims to slash truck, bus emissions by 90%","The EU's executive body, the European Commission, aims to slash emissions for heavy-duty vehicles by 90% by 2040 as compared to 2019 in a new proposal announced Tuesday.The Commission also proposed mandating that new city buses from 2030 be emissions-free vehicles.The proposal came the same day as lawmakers in the European Parliament passed a new law banning sales of fossil fuel vehicles in the bloc after 2035.Frans Timmermans, the EU's Climate Commissioner, said ""all parts of the transport sector have to actively contribute"" towards reaching the bloc's climate goals.""In 2050, nearly all of the vehicles on our roads have to be zero emission, our climate law requires it,"" he said while presenting the plans in Strasbourg.By 2050, the 27-nation bloc aspires to be fully climate neutral.The EU has interim targets set to stay on track to meet its ambitious climate goals.By 2030, the European Commission wants heavy vehicles to emit 45% less greenhouse gases compared to 2019. By 2035, this number should decrease by 65% until the target 90% is achieved in 2040.The proposal will now be subjected to scrutiny by EU member states and the European Parliament.The European Automobile Manufacturers' Association called for a similarly ambitious plan to plug in more charging stations and expand hydrogen filling stations on the continent among the 27 nations that form the bloc.As a technical matter, the industry group said that if the target of a reduction of 45% by 2030 is to be met, 400,000 zero-emission trucks would have to be operational, and a minimum 100,000 new zero-emissions trucks would have to be registered each year.The association further quantified the practical measures that would need to come into place.More than 50,000 publicly accessible chargers for trucks would need to be installed in the next seven years, with 35,000 of them being high-performance charging systems.  An additional 700 hydrogen refilling stations would also be needed.Opponents of the EU's plans have suggested neither consumers nor industry is prepared to make the change from the combustible engine to electric vehicles so fast. Tens of thousands of jobs are also at risk.Jens Gieseke, a member of parliament in the center-right European People's Party, said, ""Let the market decide what technology is best to reach our goals.""ar/rs (AFP, dpa)",2023/02/14,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810513,Fact check: Russia's disinformation campaign targets NATO,"Since Ukraine's Maidan protest movement and the annexation of Crimea in 2014, Russia has tried to influence public opinion with targeted disinformation campaigns. While the extent of these efforts both at home and abroad has been hard to quantify since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine nearly one year ago, experts tell DW that their intensity and scope have increased.One narrative, begun even before the war, has been particularly persistent: That the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) — the 30-member European and North American military alliance established after World War II — is not only threatening Russia, but may even wish to invade it.Long before the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, experts said that Russia spread such stories to justify the war.""I would say that we probably could start this [the false claims] from the Maidan revolution in 2014. Since then, Russians have been claiming that the West is meddling with Ukraine,"" said Roman Osadchuk, a research associate at the Atlantic Council, an international affairs think tank based in the United States.In many Russian narratives, cause and effect are inverted, said Lutz Güllner, head of strategic communications at the EU's diplomatic service, the European External Action Service. ""It's always about portraying how much Russia is actually threatened, is under siege, is threatened by Ukraine, and therefore must defend itself, making the war nothing more than deterrence.""For example, in a televised address a few days before the invasion, Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed that NATO was ""expanding more and more,"" with its military infrastructure encroaching upon the country's borders.There is some truth to this. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, 14 Eastern European countries have joined NATO, four of them bordering Russia. Ukraine requested the chance to join via NATO's Membership Action Plan in 2008, and the country's initiative to join has only intensified since Russia's invasion.It is also true that NATO has made logistical preparations in its Eastern European member states, in addition to preparing airfields for the rapid reinforcement of troops. However, this was also in response to Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, which was illegal under international law. The NATO alliance continues to respect the 1997 NATO-Russia Founding Act, which prohibits the additional permanent deployment of substantial combat forces in NATO accession countries. But that has not deterred Putin from his claim that NATO is threatening Russia.Putin has also alleged that Ukrainians have perpetrated genocide against Russian-speaking people in the illegally annexed ""republics"" of Donetsk and Luhansk for years, and that these areas must be ""denazified.""Such false claims have been aimed primarily at a domestic audience. But the narrative has also had some impact in the West.In an October 2022 study by the Germany-based Center for Monitoring, Analysis and Strategy, 19% of respondents in Germany agreed with the statement that Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine was an unavoidable response to NATO provocation. Some 21% partially agreed with this statement. That makes 40% of Germans who at least partially believe NATO is at fault in the Ukraine conflict.""That's a pretty high number, and that's presumably a result of both disinformation campaigns and existing beliefs and attitudes toward NATO,"" said Julia Smirnova, senior analyst at the London-based Institute for Strategic Dialogue, which has also been studying the spread of disinformation during the war.At the beginning of the invasion, there were also reports of US-funded bioweapons laboratories in Ukraine, claims that later turned out to be fake. The story about the alleged preparation of a so-called ""dirty bomb"" was circulated by the Russian Foreign Ministry. ""Evidence"" for the claim was debunked; it turned out to be old images of Russian nuclear power plants and Slovenian smoke detectors.The support of Ukraine by its Western partners — through financial aid, arms supplies and sanctions — has also been used to back Putin's primary claim that Ukraine is ""fully under external control"" and is ""strengthened by armed forces of NATO countries and pumped up with the most modern weapons.""Russian state media also claimed that NATO troops were actively involved in the war, with some military units secretly under the command of Western officers or instructors. Photos and videos of foreign volunteers fighting alongside Ukrainians were often used as evidence.""In fact, fighting against us is the NATO bloc, whose members supply the Kyiv regime with heavy weapons, ammunition and intelligence, and train military specialists,"" Nikolai Patrushev, a Putin confidant and secretary of Russia's Security Council, said late last year.In May 2022, social media users falsely claimed that EU member states were about to join the conflict.A video with a BBC news logo claimed that a Polish military general had signed an order to put army detachments on ""full alert."" But the video was a fake. The BBC denied producing it, and said that its logo had been imitated to create the fake video. Polish government officials accused Moscow of launching disinformation attacks against the country.Germany's recent decision to supply tanks to Ukraine was also immediately interpreted on social media as an admission by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz that NATO is at war with Russia.Even before the announcement, videos purporting to show the delivery of German Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine were circulating online. For Roman Osadchuk of the Atlantic Council, it's no coincidence that such videos on the topic of tank deliveries are spreading far and wide.""So for Russia, it might serve as an example. [They say] 'look, Europe is already prepared to fight us',"" he said.This article was originally published in German.",2023/02/13,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810514,"Johnson proved himself in West, now is out to be SEC's best","Jay Johnson is among the few college baseball coaches from the West Coast who have entered the cauldron that is the Southeastern Conference.

            In his first season at LSU, he smashed any notion he would be overmatched in a league that has produced three straight national champions and eight of the last 13.

            The Tigers won 40 games, had their first top-four finish in the SEC since 2017 and reached an NCAA regional final.











            Johnson was just getting started.

            LSU signed the nation's best recruiting class, brought in the top-rated group of transfers and has back the favorite to be the No. 1 overall pick in the 2023 MLB draft in center fielder Dylan Crews.

            The Tigers will open the season at home Friday night against Western Michigan as the consensus No. 1 team in the polls, the first time since 2019 they've had a top preseason ranking. 

            Any season not ending with LSU among the eight teams playing in the College World Series in Omaha, Nebraska, is a disappointment to the Tigers' passionate fans. That's the minimum expectation this year. 

            “I’m not a betting man, but if you want to bet, I would imagine they’re going to be one of those eight hot teams in Omaha and if they stay hot they’ll win the whole darn thing,"" said Andy Lopez, a College Baseball Hall of Fame coach and Pac-12 Network analyst who was Johnson’s predecessor at Arizona.

            
                Johnson made two CWS appearances in six seasons at Arizona before he became the third coach to move from the West Coast to the SEC. The first two were Lopez and Dave Serrano.

            Lopez was hired by Florida three years after he won the 1992 national title at Pepperdine. He led the Gators to two CWS appearances over seven seasons. He spent the last 14 years of his career at Arizona, winning the 2012 national championship before he retired in 2015. Johnson succeeded him in Tucson and the two are friends.

            Serrano left Cal State Fullerton after the 2011 season and coached Tennessee six years, never finishing higher than fifth in the SEC East or making an NCAA Tournament.

            The 45-year-old Johnson grew up in the Northern California town of Oroville, played at Point Loma Nazarene in San Diego and worked his way up the coaching ranks from assistant at San Diego to head coach at Nevada and Arizona.

            “I was very content at Arizona and really believed that was going to be my lifetime job,” Johnson said. “I loved those players and what we accomplished there and was very comfortable.”

            As a player and young coach, Johnson followed the Tigers and iconic coach Skip Bertman from afar as they won five national titles from 1991 to 2000.

            “For me, a lot is made out of the West Coast-to-the-South thing,"" Johnson said. ""In reality, coaching is coaching, recruiting is recruiting, and so I just wanted to test myself against the best players, the best coaches, the best programs in college baseball right now.”

            Johnson, who will earn $1.25 million in the second year of his five-year contract, said his plan was to build for 2023. He used year one to identify the program's greatest needs and addressed them in recruiting and through the transfer portal.

            Starting pitching was the first concern. Johnson said the 2022 rotation, by metrics he and his staff use, ranked 11th out of 14 in the SEC. 

            Johnson hired pitching coach Wes Johnson away from the Minnesota Twins and signed elite transfers in Paul Skenes (Air Force), Thatcher Hurd (UCLA) and Christian Little (Vanderbilt). Right-handers Chase Shores and Aiden Moffett and lefty Griffin Herring are the top freshman arms.

            The portal also yielded Tommy White, who hit 27 homers as a freshman for North Carolina State and will take over at third for first-round draft pick Jacob Berry.

            Johnson ackowledged his biggest adjustment in the move to LSU was dealing with the intense fan and media interest. Shortly after he took the job, he asked Lopez about the SEC culture.

            Lopez said the anecdote he offered Johnson applies today as much as it did 30 years ago.

            Lopez told of the reception his Gators received as they got off the bus for the first game of a three-game series at LSU. To get to the clubhouse, the visitors had to walk through a gantlet of fans in purple and gold holding brooms and warning the Gators they were going to get swept.

            “And this is Friday at 3 in the afternoon,” Lopez said. “Dang, these people are serious here. For a kid who wants to be in that environement and thrives in it, it kind of gets you juiced. I think a guy like Jay Johnson thrives in it.”

            Prosecutors said Tuesday that Joby Pool, 32, used a metal grinder to break through a gate at an industrial park in Telford, central England, on Saturday, then used a stolen semi truck to tow away a trailer loaded with Cadbury Creme Eggs and other chocolate goods worth more than 31,000 pounds ($38,000).

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810516,Naeem Khan marks two decades of sparkle and glitz at NYFW,"NEW YORK (AP) — Surrounded by long-time friends and his dog, Naeem Khan marked 20 years of glamorous designs at his New York Fashion Week show.

            The designer, recognized by his eveningwear that has graced the covers of magazines and worn by celebrities on red carpets, has no plans of stopping the momentum that got him where he is today. If anything, he’s expanding his brand with more stores, hotels and a painting exhibition.

            Khan delivered nearly 50 looks Tuesday, all of which took about five months and 600 people to complete. A model wearing a hand-sewn antique gold metal fringe cocoon dress opened the show as attendees held roses in their hands as a Valentine's Day gift from Khan. The cocoon dress sparkled and danced as the model cat walked down the runway. Each of Khan’s looks had an air of sophistication with his alluring and refined touch.











            For Khan, he still has something to prove even after 20 years.

            “I just want to show you that we in America can make couture like Paris,” he said. “It’s all about craftsmanship.” 

            After two decades the extensiveness of Khan’s repertoire is proof of his craft and it showed Tuesday as models walked in threes and fours, each wearing a similar style of glitzy sheer fabric but each with their own individual yet cohesive look. With a black and gold glittering floral sheer fabric, Khan created a tea-length dress, a cocoon caftan and a sexy embroidered slip dress. The collection was a trove of gems to pick from for any formal occasion. 

            Pat Cleveland, a model and former Halston muse, cheered some of the models on as they strutted down the runway. (Khan worked alongside legendary designer Halston at the start of his career.)

            “In fashion the decades give you so much gravitas it’s like the history of you, and where he’s been and what he has brought to the profession,” Cleveland said. “Decades of sparkle.”

            Ubah Hassan, who has been cast in the remake of “Real Housewives of New York,” said each piece of Khan’s collection was better than the other.

            “This man works,” she said. “He literally sent an army of people.”

            While Khan played with geometric beading, he also had fun with feathers and needle pointing. A red and green floral needlepoint design gave the flowers on a long-sleeve dress and jumpsuit an almost 3D like quality, and ostrich feathers that lined the hem of a dress or were formed to make a stunning blue feather cape offered a youthful touch.

            “In fashion, to sustain yourself for 20 years and to have a business that can be successful for 20 years is not an easy task,” Khan said. “To have all my ladies who love my stuff it is so meaningful to me, and it just keeps me going.”NEW YORK (AP) — Surrounded by long-time friends and his dog, Naeem Khan marked 20 years of glamorous designs at his New York Fashion Week show.The designer, recognized by his eveningwear that has graced the covers of magazines and worn by celebrities on red carpets, has no plans of stopping the momentum that got him where he is today.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810517,Vermont ice fishing deaths highlight safety protocols,"SOUTH HERO, Vt. (AP) — Vermont authorities could not have done anything more to prevent the deaths of three ice fishermen who fell through the ice on Lake Champlain in two separate incidents within days of each other, the head of the Vermont Fish and Wildlife Department said Tuesday.

            The men fell through the ice and died this past week, prompting safety warnings from the state. 

            Ice conditions are typically good at this time of year for ice fishing, but it has been unusually warm, according to Chris Herrick, commissioner of the Vermont Department of Fish and Wildlife. The department always recommends checking the ice — with a metal pole or an auger — and never recommends taking a vehicle onto the ice, Herrick said.











            “All along, like we always do, we tell people to check the ice conditions, talk to the bait shops and find out what people were saying about the thickness. And so I feel our messaging was right on target,"" he said. 

            The department had put out a news release on Jan. 3 about recommended ice thickness, followed by a social media post. It also supplied ice fishing safety tips and other information online. 

            Wayne Alexander, 62, of Grand Isle, fell through the ice on Feb. 9 in Grand Isle State Park and was pronounced dead the following day. 

            John Fleury, 71, of Williamstown, and Wayne Fleury, 88, of East Montpelier, fell through the ice and died on Feb. 11 in Keeler Bay, South Hero.

            Vermont State Police said following the deaths that state authorities were advising “the public to stay off the ice on Lake Champlain while the current warm weather persists.”

            State leaders have identified warming temperatures as a concern, especially in recreation. The rate of warming “has increased through the last 120 years, and is currently around +0.5°F a decade,” according to the Initial Vermont Climate Action Plan released in 2021.

            The 43rd annual Islands Ice Fishing Derby was also canceled as a result of ice conditions. And organizers of the Biff Ice Fishing Derby scheduled for Feb. 24 to 26 on Lake Champlain have already called off this year’s event because of the poor ice conditions.

            “It was definitely a hard decision but definitely the right decision,” said Alaina Mobbs, president of the derby created in memory of her brother-in-law, John Fay, an avid ice fisherman who died unexpectedly several years ago.

            Although organizers were not asked to cancel the event, they took note of state warnings about thin ice. She said she would not want to put anyone else through the pain that the families of the three men who died are going through.

            “I would feel horrible if somebody got hurt,” Mobbs said. “I do not want to promote that.”

            Money raised by the derby is donated to local charities. Last year, about 300 people participated, raising nearly $4,000.

            An Arctic snap a few weeks ago brought ice to the lake, but temperatures then warmed, and that caused the ice to deteriorate, Herrick said. The poor ice conditions can be deceptive because ice can be thinner further into the lake where there is a current, he said.

            “It’s a bigger body of water. Believe it or not the lake has a lot of currents in it,"" Herrick said. “If you’re moving around a lot, you need to be careful.”SOUTH HERO, Vt.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810518,COLLEGE BASEBALL '23: 10 teams to watch,"Ten teams to watch in college baseball this season, listed in alphabetical order with 2022 records:

            ARKANSAS (46-21)

            Dave Van Horn has led the Razorbacks to the College World Series in seven of his 20 seasons and is still looking for the program's first national championship. Arkansas made it to its CWS bracket final last season and is the only team in the country with at least 45 wins in each of the last five seasons, excluding the pandemic-shortened 2020. 











            LSU (40-22)

            The consensus No. 1 team in the preseason rankings won the offseason with second-year coach Jay Johnson upgrading his pitching staff through recruiting and the transfer portal and adding one of the top power hitters in the country in Tommy White from North Carolina State. Dylan Crews remains the star and is on track to be the top overall pick in the Major League Baseball draft.

            MARYLAND (48-14)

            Defending Big Ten champion Terrapins set program records with 48 wins and 137 homers and hosted a regional for the first time. They bring back their batting leader in Luke Schliger and Jason Savacool, an eight-game winner who went at least six innings in 15 of 16 starts. Big additions are Northeast Conference player of the year Matt Woods (Bryant) and Elijah Lambros (South Carolina).

            MISSISSIPPI (42-23)

            The Rebels rebounded from a midseason funk to win their first national championship as the last at-large team selected for the NCAA Tournament. SS Jacob Gonzalez is a projected top-10 draft pick and fully healthy after injuring a knee last fall. Five of the starting nine players are back in addition to pitchers who threw half of the innings at the College World Series.

            OKLAHOMA STATE (42-22)

            Six everyday players return, and transfer Juaron Watts-Brown is conference preseason newcomer and pitcher of the year. Watts-Brown threw the first complete game no-hitter in Long Beach State history, and his 13.62 strikeouts per nine innings were a program record and fifth nationally. Nolan McLean hit a team-leading 19 homers.

            TENNESSEE (57-9)

            The Volunteers set a program record for wins and won SEC regular-season and tournament titles for the first time since 1995, but losing a three-game super regional to Notre Dame still smarts after Tennessee spent most of the season atop the polls. The foundation is set with the core of a pitching staff that led the nation in ERA and held opponents to a .199 batting average. 

            TCU (38-22)

            The Horned Frogs' expectations are high even though they lost their entire weekend rotation. Cam Parker split time between starting and relieving and likely will be the Friday night starter. Big 12 preseason player of the year Brayden Taylor had 28 extra-base hits and 50 RBIs.

            STANFORD (47-18)

            The Cardinal looks to rebound after going two-games-and-out at the CWS for the first time in 18 appearances. Carter Graham led the Pac-12 with 22 homers and Tommy Troy batted .500 with five homers in postseason. Quinn Matthews went from starter to closer and was only pitcher in country with nine wins and nine saves.

            UCLA (40-24)

            Like many years, the Bruins' biggest question mark is offense. They hit only 47 homers and were in the bottom half of the Pac-12 in homers, slugging and scoring. The pitching seems to replenish itself each season. One of the intriguing arms is Alonzo Treadwell, a 6-foot-8, 230-pounder who goes from closer to weekend starter.

            WAKE FOREST (41-19-1)

            The Demon Deacons made the biggest one-year improvement in program history after going 20-27 in 2021, and the ceiling is extremely high with the return of ACC pitcher of the year Rhett Lowder and the rest of the weekend rotation. Run support won't be an issue. Wake batted .319 and averaged 9.2 runs per game. Brock Wilken, who had 23 homers and 77 RBIs, is one of the top offensive players in the country.

Dylan Crews remains the star and is on track to be the top overall pick in the Major League Baseball draft.MARYLAND (48-14)Defending Big Ten champion Terrapins set program records with 48 wins and 137 homers and hosted a regional for the first time. They bring back their batting leader in Luke Schliger and Jason Savacool, an eight-game winner who went at least six innings in 15 of 16 starts. Big additions are Northeast Conference player of the year Matt Woods (Bryant) and Elijah Lambros (South Carolina).MISSISSIPPI (42-23)The Rebels rebounded from a midseason funk to win their first national championship as the last at-large team selected for the NCAA Tournament. SS Jacob Gonzalez is a projected top-10 draft pick and fully healthy after injuring a knee last fall. Five of the starting nine players are back in addition to pitchers who threw half of the innings at the College World Series.OKLAHOMA STATE (42-22)Six everyday players return, and transfer Juaron Watts-Brown is conference preseason newcomer and pitcher of the year. Watts-Brown threw the first complete game no-hitter in Long Beach State history, and his 13.62 strikeouts per nine innings were a program record and fifth nationally. Nolan McLean hit a team-leading 19 homers.TENNESSEE (57-9)The Volunteers set a program record for wins and won SEC regular-season and tournament titles for the first time since 1995, but losing a three-game super regional to Notre Dame still smarts after Tennessee spent most of the season atop the polls. The foundation is set with the core of a pitching staff that led the nation in ERA and held opponents to a .199 batting average.TCU (38-22)The Horned Frogs' expectations are high even though they lost their entire weekend rotation. Cam Parker split time between starting and relieving and likely will be the Friday night starter. Big 12 preseason player of the year Brayden Taylor had 28 extra-base hits and 50 RBIs.STANFORD (47-18)The Cardinal looks to rebound after going two-games-and-out at the CWS for the first time in 18 appearances. Carter Graham led the Pac-12 with 22 homers and Tommy Troy batted .500 with five homers in postseason. Quinn Matthews went from starter to closer and was only pitcher in country with nine wins and nine saves.UCLA (40-24)Like many years, the Bruins' biggest question mark is offense. They hit only 47 homers and were in the bottom half of the Pac-12 in homers, slugging and scoring. The pitching seems to replenish itself each season. One of the intriguing arms is Alonzo Treadwell, a 6-foot-8, 230-pounder who goes from closer to weekend starter.WAKE FOREST (41-19-1)The Demon Deacons made the biggest one-year improvement in program history after going 20-27 in 2021, and the ceiling is extremely high with the return of ACC pitcher of the year Rhett Lowder and the rest of the weekend rotation. Run support won't be an issue. Wake batted .319 and averaged 9.2 runs per game. Brock Wilken, who had 23 homers and 77 RBIs, is one of the top offensive players in the country.___AP college sports: https://apnews.com/hub/college-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/02/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810519,UN chief: Rising seas risk 'death sentence' for some nations,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The United Nations chief warned Tuesday that global sea levels have risen faster since 1900 and their relentless increase puts countries like Bangladesh, China, India and the Netherlands at risk and acutely endangers nearly 900 million people living in low-lying coastal areas.

            In a grim speech to the Security Council’s first-ever meeting on the threat to international peace and security from rising sea levels, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres declared that sea levels will rise significantly even if global warming is “miraculously” limited to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), the elusive international goal.

            He warned the Earth is more likely on a path to warming that amounts to “a death sentence” for countries vulnerable to that rise, including many small island nations.











            In addition to threatened countries, Guterres said, “mega-cities on every continent will face serious effects, including Cairo, Lagos, Maputo, Bangkok, Dhaka, Jakarta, Mumbai, Shanghai, Copenhagen, London, Los Angeles, New York, Buenos Aires and Santiago.”

            The U.N. chief stressed that every fraction of a degree in global warming counts, since sea level rise could double if temperatures rise by 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), and could increase exponentially with further temperature increases.

            The World Meteorological Organization released data Tuesday spelling out the grave danger of rising seas, Guterres said.

            “Global average sea levels have risen faster since 1900 than over any preceding century in the last 3,000 years,” he said. “The global ocean has warmed faster over the past century than at any time in the past 11,000 years.”

            According to the data cited by Guterres, the global mean sea level will rise by about 2 to 3 meters (about 6.5 to 9.8 feet) over the next 2,000 years if warming is limited to 1.5 degrees Celsius. With a 2-degree Celsius increase, seas could rise up to 6 meters (19.7 feet), and with a 5-degree Celsius increase, seas could rise up to 22 meters (72 feet), according to the WMO. 

            “Our world is hurtling past the 1.5-degree warming limit that a livable future requires, and with present policies, is careening towards 2.8 degrees — a death sentence for vulnerable countries,” Guterres said.

            The consequences are unthinkable, Guterres said. Low-lying communities and entire countries could disappear, the world would witness a mass exodus of entire populations on a biblical scale, and competition would become ever fiercer for fresh water, land and other resources.

            Guterres has been trying to call the world’s attention to the dangers posed by climate change, to spur action.

            In October, he warned that the world is in “a life-or-death struggle” for survival as “climate chaos gallops ahead” and accused the world’s 20 wealthiest countries of failing to do enough to stop the planet from overheating. In November, he said the planet is heading toward irreversible “climate chaos” and urged global leaders to put the world back on track to cut emissions, keep promises on climate financing and help developing countries speed their transition to renewable energy.

            The landmark Paris agreement adopted in 2015 to address climate change called for global temperatures to rise a maximum of 2 degrees Celsius by the end of the century compared to pre-industrial times, and as close as possible to 1.5 degrees Celsius.

            Guterres said the world must address the climate crisis as the root cause of rising seas, and the Security Council has a critical role to play in building the political will required.

            The Security Council meeting, organized by Malta, which holds the council presidency this month, heard speakers from some 75 countries, large and small, endangered and landlocked, all voicing concern about the impact of the contining rising seas on the future of the world — and for some, the survival of their own countries.

            Samoa’s U.N. ambassador, Fatumanava-o-Upolu III Pa’olelei Luteru, speaking on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States which he chairs, told the council: “There is a litany of new examples of the sudden and slow onset impact of climate change on small islands, from king tides, to super hurricanes to the unstoppable and unprecedented rise in sea levels.”

            The impact on people and the economies of the islands “will continue to be extraordinary,” he said, raising issues of their survival and continuation as states.

            Alliance members “are among the lowest emitters of greenhouse gases that drive climate change and sea level rise. Yet, we face some of the most severe consequences of rising sea levels,” Lutero said. “To expect small island state to shoulder the burden of sea level rise, without assistance from the international community will be the pinnacle of inequities.”

            He said that cooperation to address rising seas is “a legal obligation” for every country, and that there is an urgent need for nations to fulfill their international commitments on climate change and finance.

            Ambassador Amatlain Kabua of the Marshall Islands said many of the tools to address climate change and rising seas are already in from of the Security Council, and “more focused action from the international system can be invited.” But she said, “What is needed most in the political will to start the job, supported by a U.N. special representative” to spur global action.

            U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said that “the threat of sea level rise is real, it is a direct result of our climate crisis, and it is a matter of international peace and security.”

            “The council must take action,” she said, pointing to the threat of hundreds of millions in low-lying coastal areas losing their homes, livelihoods and communities. 

            “Fortunately, the worst impacts can be avoided, but we have to act now, and we have to act together,"" Thomas-Greenfield said.

            General Assembly President Csaba Kőrösi said, “At the current rate, sea levels will be 1 to 1.6 meters higher by 2100, according to the World Climate Research Program.”

            “In the Nile and Mekong Deltas — some of the richest agricultural regions in the world — ten to twenty percent of arable land will sink beneath the waves,” he said. 

            “Climate induced sea-level rise is also provoking new legal questions that are at the very core of national and state identity. What happens to a nation’s sovereignty — including U.N. membership — if it sinks beneath the sea?” he asked.

            “Science tells us that whether cities or countries disappear depends on whether we as humans counteract the threat,” Kőrösi said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810520,NASCAR 75: Earnhardt Jr. says NASCAR 'is family',"With NASCAR celebrating its 75th anniversary in 2023, The Associated Press asked retired Hall of Fame driver and NBC Sports analyst Dale Earnhardt Jr. to write an essay on the series and its role in his life. Earnhardt is a third-generation North Carolina racer, two-time Daytona 500 winner and has an important voice in the direction of NASCAR: 

            What does NASCAR mean to me? 

            Besides bent sheet metal and burnt motor oil? NASCAR is an ever-evolving machine. Looking back over the decades of change is overwhelming. But there is one constant that was always dependable.











            NASCAR is family. 

            My earliest memory of being at a NASCAR event was 1981. Dad was grinding it out in the back of the top 10 almost every week. I was too young to understand that he was one season removed from winning the championship, and his career was now wandering off course. 

            I just remember running up and down the roads, all of us in a custom passenger van, going to every race. I raced Matchbox cars in the floorboard on those trips. Once we got close to the house, Kelley would often get to sit in dad’s lap and steer us the rest of the way home. Today, I won’t put the truck in drive unless each of my girls is buckled in tight.

            Gatherings at my grandfather Robert Gee’s highlighted Charlotte race weekends. I eagerly analyzed all the various race cars that would come through his backyard garage. Short track, dirt and asphalt cars, big buck NASCAR Cup machines, his own Busch Grand National cars he polished and shined. The Gee family would gather on the back deck for steaks grilled by Robert. 

            Days at the track as a kid were spent with friends like Brad Means, whose dad Jimmy raced as an independent. There was Scott Williams, whose dad Doug was a mechanic and crew chief. I still talk to Mike Whitcomb, whose dad was a car owner back then. Everyone had kids our age, it seemed. We all got along for the most part unless our dads wrecked each other. We would go up and down pit road begging teams to let us wax their cars. We never missed a pay-to-ride go-kart track in any town on the series schedule. We huddled in motel rooms building model cars at 2 a.m. and laid washers on the Darlington railroad tracks for the 1 a.m. train. 

            All of this happened before I ever drove a lap in what would be an 18-year Cup career. But those early days shaped my perception of racing and my perception of NASCAR. NASCAR is family. There are the blood relatives who are part of the journey. But there are also the friends who become family – many of them, you put your life in their hands. 

            NASCAR is community. It’s relationships. It’s people. The cars are constantly changing. The rules change, as do the facilities. But the constant is that people are the most critical ingredient. You race your entire life with family and friends, and that bond you create during the long days at the track is as durable as the anvil dad used to hammer out a homemade drive shaft hoop in 1984 for his Nova that now sits on the shop floor at JRM.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810521,"Dave Hollis, Disney exec turned self-help author, dies at 47","DALLAS (AP) — Dave Hollis, who left his post as a Disney executive to help his wife run a successful lifestyle empire, has died at his home in Texas. He was 47. 

            Hollis, whose ex-wife Rachel Hollis wrote the bestseller “Girl, Wash Your Face,” was pronounced dead Sunday afternoon at his home in Dripping Springs, a city on the outskirts of Austin, according to Hays County Justice of the Peace Andrew Cable. 

            An autopsy will be performed to determine the cause of death since Hollis, who was last seen the evening before, was “youthful and didn't have a long medical history,” Cable said.











            In an Instagram post on Tuesday, Rachel Hollis asked for prayers as the family tries to “navigate through the unthinkable.”

            “We are devastated,” she wrote. “I have no words and my heart is too broken.”

            Dave Hollis worked for Disney for 17 years and had been head of distribution for the company for seven years when he left in 2018 to join his wife's venture. The parents of four moved from Los Angeles to the Austin area, collaborated on livestreams, podcasts and organized life-affirming conferences. In their podcast, “Rise Together,” they focused on marriage.

            When Rachel Hollis announced on Instagram in 2020 that they were getting divorced, she said they had worked “endlessly” over the prior three years to make their marriage work but came to the conclusion that “it is healthier and more respectful for us to choose this as the end of our journey as a married couple.”

            During his tenure at Disney, Hollis oversaw the release of blockbusters including “Black Panther” and films in the the “Star Wars” franchise. He told The Associated Press in 2018 that he joined his wife’s enterprise after realizing he was in a corporate rut. He said his new life felt “like a calling.”

            Hollis also wrote motivational books. His book “Get Out of Your Own Way: A Skeptic’s Guide to Growth and Fulfillment” was published in 2020 and he released “Built Through Courage: Face Your Fears to Live the Life You Were Meant For” in 2021.

            Fitness trainer Heidi Powell, who dated Dave Hollis after his divorce, called his death “a nightmare” in an Instagram post Tuesday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810522,NASCAR 75: Caruth reflects on sport he calls 'my everything',"With NASCAR celebrating its 75th anniversary in 2023, The Associated Press asked Rajah Caruth, a 20-year-old graduate of the “Drive for Diversity” program and a student at Winston-Salem State, to write an essay on the series and its role in his life:

            What does NASCAR mean to me? 

            To some, NASCAR is people from the South driving in circles. To some, it may be something cool to catch on television. For others, it is something that they were born into, were groomed for or something that they just happen to be good at. 











            For me, it is none of those. NASCAR is my everything.

            What stemmed from my first viewing of Pixar’s “Cars” film in 2006 has become part of my identity and soul. Even before I fortunately got my start as a driver, racing was the first thing I thought about in the morning, the last thing I thought about when I went to sleep, and a majority of what was in between. 

            As a result of my relatively late start at driving compared to my competitors, I became more than a student of the sport — I became obsessed. I collected all the diecast that my family could afford, I watched every single Truck, Nationwide, and Cup practice, qualifying and race, and watched 2014 onboard videos in class all throughout high school. From the quintessential close finishes and eye-catching liveries, to the fascinating facilities and interesting personalities, I consumed all things NASCAR. 

            From “NASCAR: The Complete History” by Greg Fielden (to) shows like “NASCAR Now” on ESPN with Dr. Jerry Punch and Ricky Craven and “WindTunnel” by Dave Despain, and even NASCAR stop motions and video game content on YouTube. I grew to love this sport the more I learned and the more I’ve gotten to know the individuals that make it happen.

            To have the opportunity to a) race FULL-TIME in the Craftsman Truck Series, and b) drive a Chevrolet Silverado RST with the Wendell Scott Foundation on it is truly special to me. At nearly every opportunity I had in school, I did projects on Wendell and his family. From Black History Month to National History Day projects, I’ve known and learned about the legacy of his endeavors on and off the racetrack for years. 

            The fact that I am the young Black man who gets to add to that prolific legacy and start my own is tremendous to me, and I cannot wait to show what I’ve got on the racetrack. I welcome the chance to represent the Scott family, my blood family, those who have supported me up to this point and those who look like me, share my background and ambitions. With great power comes great responsibility. 

            Nowadays, I am — hopefully and God-willingly — on a trajectory that could place me competing against the men that I grew up idolizing on Saturdays and Sundays, and that potential drives me every single day. 

            The realities, hardships and obstacles of being Black in a predominately white sport all perish in comparison to my adoration, passion and love for it. NASCAR has been all I’ve ever wanted to be apart of since I can remember, and I’m going to do whatever it takes to be one of the best ever.

For others, it is something that they were born into, were groomed for or something that they just happen to be good at.For me, it is none of those. NASCAR is my everything.What stemmed from my first viewing of Pixar’s “Cars” film in 2006 has become part of my identity and soul. Even before I fortunately got my start as a driver, racing was the first thing I thought about in the morning, the last thing I thought about when I went to sleep, and a majority of what was in between.As a result of my relatively late start at driving compared to my competitors, I became more than a student of the sport — I became obsessed. I collected all the diecast that my family could afford, I watched every single Truck, Nationwide, and Cup practice, qualifying and race, and watched 2014 onboard videos in class all throughout high school. From the quintessential close finishes and eye-catching liveries, to the fascinating facilities and interesting personalities, I consumed all things NASCAR.From “NASCAR: The Complete History” by Greg Fielden (to) shows like “NASCAR Now” on ESPN with Dr. Jerry Punch and Ricky Craven and “WindTunnel” by Dave Despain, and even NASCAR stop motions and video game content on YouTube. I grew to love this sport the more I learned and the more I’ve gotten to know the individuals that make it happen.To have the opportunity to a) race FULL-TIME in the Craftsman Truck Series, and b) drive a Chevrolet Silverado RST with the Wendell Scott Foundation on it is truly special to me. At nearly every opportunity I had in school, I did projects on Wendell and his family. From Black History Month to National History Day projects, I’ve known and learned about the legacy of his endeavors on and off the racetrack for years.The fact that I am the young Black man who gets to add to that prolific legacy and start my own is tremendous to me, and I cannot wait to show what I’ve got on the racetrack. I welcome the chance to represent the Scott family, my blood family, those who have supported me up to this point and those who look like me, share my background and ambitions. With great power comes great responsibility.Nowadays, I am — hopefully and God-willingly — on a trajectory that could place me competing against the men that I grew up idolizing on Saturdays and Sundays, and that potential drives me every single day.The realities, hardships and obstacles of being Black in a predominately white sport all perish in comparison to my adoration, passion and love for it. NASCAR has been all I’ve ever wanted to be apart of since I can remember, and I’m going to do whatever it takes to be one of the best ever.— RKC___AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/apf-AutoRacing and https://apnews.com/hub/daytona-500",2023/02/15,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810528,Missouri man accused of confining woman faces new charges,"LIBERTY, Mo. (AP) — A Missouri man accused of keeping a woman hidden in his basement while repeatedly sexually assaulting her was indicted by a grand jury on nine new charges, prosecutors announced Tuesday.

            Timothy M. Haslett, of Excelsior Springs, was indicted on one count of rape, four counts of sodomy, two counts of second-degree assault and one count each of kidnapping and endangering the welfare of a child, Clay County Prosecutor Zachary Thompson said.

            Haslett, 40, is being held in the Clay County Detention Center on $3 million bond. If found guilty, he faces up to five life sentences and another 36 years in prison.











            The charges supersede charges of rape, kidnapping and assault filed after Haslett was arrested in October when a woman told investigators she was raped repeatedly while being held captive in his basement for about a month. 

            “We would not be here today if not for the bravery of one woman and the tireless efforts of 16 different agencies,” Thompson said. 

            He said law enforcement officers have followed more than 100 leads and spent more than 1,200 hours on the case, but he said the investigation continues.

            Court documents say the child endangerment charge stems from leaving unsecured weapons accessible to the child, KSHB-TV reported.

            Thompson declined to comment on whether detectives are investigating the possibility of other possible victims. 

            Haslett's public defender, Tiffany Leuty, did not return a call seeking comment. Haslett's next court hearing is scheduled for Friday. 

            The woman, who has not been named, said she escaped when Haslett left the house to take his child to school and then ran to a neighbor's home for help. 

            At the time, the victim was wearing latex lingerie and a metal collar with what appeared to be a padlock on the front, according to court documents. 

            In January, the Excelsior Springs Police Department said it was looking for 36-year-old Jaynie M. Crosdale as a potential witness in case.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810529,Vermont advances nonresident medically assisted suicide bill,"MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) — A bill that would make Vermont the second state in the country to allow terminally ill nonresidents to seek medically assisted suicide was approved by a state legislative committee on Tuesday.

            The House Human Services Committee unanimously approved removing the residency requirement. A similar bill is in committee in the Senate. 

            The full Legislature must consider the proposal, and then, if it is passed, it would need to be signed by Republican Gov. Phil Scott to become law.











            Eight states, including California, Colorado, Hawaii, Maine and New Jersey, and Washington, D.C., also have medically assisted suicide laws. In Montana, the state Supreme Court ruled that state law does not prohibit medical aid in dying.

            If removal of the residency requirement is approved, Vermont would join Oregon, which no longer requires people to be residents of the state to use its law allowing terminally ill people to receive lethal medication. 

            Democratic Rep. Jessica Brumsted, vice chair of the Vermont committee, said she was pleased that the panel took this step, so that if her parents who live out of state, or children, became terminally ill she might be able to offer them that option. 

            “If someone was that sick in my family ... living out of state, I'd like to think that they could come back and be in my home and go through this process with someone in my family,” Brumsted said. 

            Before the vote, the committee heard additional testimony.

            Mary Hahn Beerworth, executive director of the Vermont Right to Life Committee, said assisted suicide “was and remains a matter of contention.”

            “To be clear, Vermont Right to Life opposed the underlying concept behind assisted suicide and opposes the move to remove the residency requirement as there are still no safeguards that protect vulnerable terminally ill people in Vermont from coercion,” she said. 

            David Englander, the state Health Department’s senior policy and legal advisor, said no complaints have been reported to the department or the attorney general’s office regarding the use of medically assisted suicide.

            “It's important that we move to normalize this kind of care because it is both exceptional but also everyday,” he said. 

            
                In a settlement filed in federal court last year, the Oregon Health Authority and the Oregon Medical Board agreed to stop enforcing the residency requirement and to ask the Legislature to remove it from the law.

            At the time, advocates said they would use the settlement to press the other states and Washington, D.C. that have medically assisted suicide laws, to drop their residency requirements as well. 

            In August of last year, a Connecticut woman with cancer sued Vermont for allowing only its own residents to take advantage of a state's assisted suicide law.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810534,"Buffett's firm buys Apple, slashes chipmaker and bank stakes","OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Billionaire Warren Buffett's company added to its already substantial Apple investment at the end of last year while slashing a new investment in computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor and two longtime bank holdings.

            Berkshire Hathaway Inc. revealed several changes to its stock portfolio in documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission Tuesday. Many investors follow the company's moves closely because of Buffett's remarkably successful investing record over the decades.

            Berkshire picked up nearly 21 million more shares in the iPhone maker during the final three months of last year to give it 915.6 million shares at the end of 2022.











            Buffett has called Apple one of the four giants that drive Berkshire's results even though it is only a stock investment. Berkshire's other main drivers are companies that it owns outright: its insurance unit that includes Geico, its energy company that owns several major utilities, and BNSF railroad.

            During the quarter, Berkshire slashed its investments in Taiwan Semiconductor, US Bancorp and Bank of New York Mellon.

            Just three months after revealing a 60 million-share stake in the chipmaker, Berkshire cut its Taiwan Semiconductor investment down to 8.3 million shares.

            Berkshire also cut its US Bancorp investment drastically from 52.5 million shares to 6.7 million by the end of the year.

            Berkshire Hathaway cut its investment in Bank of New York Mellon again and sold off more than 37 million shares during the quarter to leave it with just over 25 million shares of the bank.

            The quarterly filings Berkshire submitted Tuesday don't make clear which investments Buffett is responsible for and which ones were made by the company's two other investment managers, but Buffett generally handles all of Berkshire's biggest investments worth $1 billion or more. Buffett doesn't regularly comment on these stock filings.

            Berkshire also added to one of its smaller investments that it first revealed three months ago when it picked up more than 1.2 million Louisiana Pacific shares to give it control of nearly 10% of that maker of building products.

            During the quarter, Buffett continued to trim Berkshire's investment in Activision Blizzard to 52.7 million shares. He has said that he bought that stock as a way to bet that Microsoft's acquisition of the video game maker will ultimately go through.

            The Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate Buffett leads also trimmed its investments in the grocer Kroger and Ally Financial.

            Buffett's biggest investment over the past year in oil producer Occidental Petroleum remained unchanged during the quarter. Berkshire held 194.4 million Occidental shares and warrants to buy another 83.9 million shares at the end of the year.

            Berkshire did pick up nearly 2 million more Chevron shares during the quarter to give it control of 8.7% of the oil giant.

            One of the biggest changes in Berkshire's portfolio isn't reflected in the SEC filings because its investment in Chinese electric car maker BYD is held on the Hong Kong stock exchange. Since August, Berkshire has sold off 95 million of the 225 million BYD shares it bought back in 2008.

            Besides stocks, Berkshire owns an eclectic mix of dozens of different manufacturing, retail and service businesses.OMAHA, Neb.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810535,Eagles coordinators' consolation prize: head coaching jobs,"The coordinators for the Super Bowl runner-up Philadelphia Eagles both landed first-time head coaching gigs 48 hours after their loss to the Kansas City Chiefs.

            DC Jonathan Gannon replaced Kliff Kingsbury in Arizona on Tuesday and OC Shane Steichen was hired in Indianapolis, succeeding interim head coach Jeff Saturday.

            That completes this year's protracted hiring cycle that featured just five openings. 











            First-timer DeMeco Ryans was hired by the Houston Texans and Sean Payton (Denver) and Frank Reich (Carolina) both were hired for their second head coaching jobs. Payton had stepped down in New Orleans a year ago before spending last season in the broadcast booth and Reich was fired by the Colts in October when their season started to unravel.

            Payton succeeds Nathaniel Hackett, who became just the fifth head coach in NFL history not to make it through his first NFL season when he was fired in December. Hackett landed in New York as the Jets' offensive coordinator. 

            Hackett's college buddy, Ejiro Evero, who did a stellar job as Denver's defensive coordinator, interviewed for all five head coach openings. When he didn't land any of them, he sought out of his contract with the Broncos so he could start fresh as the Carolina Panthers' defensive coordinator. 

            Left out again was Kansas City offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy, who has now been interviewed 16 times by 15 teams over the last five hiring cycles.

            Bieniemy won his second ring with Andy Reid on Sunday when Patrick Mahomes led the Chiefs to a 38-35 come-from-behind victory over the Eagles in Super Bowl 57.

            Bieniemy has been instrumental in the Chiefs' success but he's also been overshadowed by Reid, a master play designer and play caller who is among the most successful head coaches in league history.

            Reid has long hoped for Bieniemy to get his shot as a head coach, saying recently, ""Eric Bieniemy has been tremendous for us and I think tremendous for the National Football League. I’m hoping he has an opportunity to go somewhere and do his thing where he can run the show and be Eric Bieniemy.”

            Bieniemy, who was among more than a dozen candidates for the Colts' head coaching job, might need to get out of Reid's shadow and gain full control of an offense to change his chronic runner-up status.

            The Washington Commanders have requested permission to speak with him about their vacant offensive coordinator job. 

            Saturday was a stunning midseason hire as interim head coach in Indianapolis because he had no coaching experience at any level. He was considered for the permanent position, but the Colts decided to make Steichen the league's third 37-year-old head coach instead.

            “We felt Shane had a lot of that offensive magic that can be hard to find, knowing we’re going to have a young quarterback to develop,” Colts owner Jim Irsay said. “He had a presence and boy did it come through. Also his mind, thinking multiple things at once, disseminating those things quickly, I think he has a special mind for football.”

            Steichen's resume includes working with Philip Rivers and helping to mentor Justin Herbert and Jalen Hurts.

            The Colts have had almost as much instability at head coach and under center as have the Broncos, who have had a different starting quarterback every opener since 2016 and are on their fifth head coach since winning Super Bowl 50 seven years ago.

            The Colts now have their fourth head coach since 2017 and are likely to have a new starting QB for the seventh straight season as most draft analysts expect them to select a quarterback with the fourth overall pick in the draft.

            Steichen takes over a team that went 4-12-1 and used three starting quarterbacks, two play-callers and two head coaches last year. 

            Gannon, 40, takes over an Arizona team that went 4-13.

            His smothering defenses piled up sacks the last two seasons but his resume took a bit of a hit in the Super Bowl when the Eagles coughed up a double-digit halftime lead and couldn't stop a limping Mahomes from leading the Chiefs to scores on all four of their second-half drives. 

            That didn't faze Cardinals owner Michael Bidwill, who is trying to find a leader who can help the franchise win its first NFL championship since 1947. Helping in that cause is the No. 3 overall pick in the upcoming draft.

            AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFLThe coordinators for the Super Bowl runner-up Philadelphia Eagles both landed first-time head coaching gigs 48 hours after their loss to the Kansas City Chiefs.DC Jonathan Gannon replaced Kliff Kingsbury in Arizona on Tuesday and OC Shane Steichen was hired in Indianapolis, succeeding interim head coach Jeff Saturday.That completes this year's protracted hiring cycle that featured just five openings.First-timer DeMeco Ryans was hired by the Houston Texans and Sean Payton (Denver) and Frank Reich (Carolina) both were hired for their second head coaching jobs. Payton had stepped down in New Orleans a year ago before spending last season in the broadcast booth and Reich was fired by the Colts in October when their season started to unravel.Payton succeeds Nathaniel Hackett, who became just the fifth head coach in NFL history not to make it through his first NFL season when he was fired in December. Hackett landed in New York as the Jets' offensive coordinator.Hackett's college buddy, Ejiro Evero, who did a stellar job as Denver's defensive coordinator, interviewed for all five head coach openings. When he didn't land any of them, he sought out of his contract with the Broncos so he could start fresh as the Carolina Panthers' defensive coordinator.Left out again was Kansas City offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy, who has now been interviewed 16 times by 15 teams over the last five hiring cycles.Bieniemy won his second ring with Andy Reid on Sunday when Patrick Mahomes led the Chiefs to a 38-35 come-from-behind victory over the Eagles in Super Bowl 57.Bieniemy has been instrumental in the Chiefs' success but he's also been overshadowed by Reid, a master play designer and play caller who is among the most successful head coaches in league history.Reid has long hoped for Bieniemy to get his shot as a head coach, saying recently, ""Eric Bieniemy has been tremendous for us and I think tremendous for the National Football League. I’m hoping he has an opportunity to go somewhere and do his thing where he can run the show and be Eric Bieniemy.”Bieniemy, who was among more than a dozen candidates for the Colts' head coaching job, might need to get out of Reid's shadow and gain full control of an offense to change his chronic runner-up status.The Washington Commanders have requested permission to speak with him about their vacant offensive coordinator job.Saturday was a stunning midseason hire as interim head coach in Indianapolis because he had no coaching experience at any level. He was considered for the permanent position, but the Colts decided to make Steichen the league's third 37-year-old head coach instead.“We felt Shane had a lot of that offensive magic that can be hard to find, knowing we’re going to have a young quarterback to develop,” Colts owner Jim Irsay said. “He had a presence and boy did it come through. Also his mind, thinking multiple things at once, disseminating those things quickly, I think he has a special mind for football.”Steichen's resume includes working with Philip Rivers and helping to mentor Justin Herbert and Jalen Hurts.The Colts have had almost as much instability at head coach and under center as have the Broncos, who have had a different starting quarterback every opener since 2016 and are on their fifth head coach since winning Super Bowl 50 seven years ago.The Colts now have their fourth head coach since 2017 and are likely to have a new starting QB for the seventh straight season as most draft analysts expect them to select a quarterback with the fourth overall pick in the draft.Steichen takes over a team that went 4-12-1 and used three starting quarterbacks, two play-callers and two head coaches last year.Gannon, 40, takes over an Arizona team that went 4-13.His smothering defenses piled up sacks the last two seasons but his resume took a bit of a hit in the Super Bowl when the Eagles coughed up a double-digit halftime lead and couldn't stop a limping Mahomes from leading the Chiefs to scores on all four of their second-half drives.That didn't faze Cardinals owner Michael Bidwill, who is trying to find a leader who can help the franchise win its first NFL championship since 1947. Helping in that cause is the No. 3 overall pick in the upcoming draft.Unlike Steichen, Gannon doesn't need a quarterback even though Kyler Murray is expected to miss the start of next season as he recovers from a torn right ACL.With the head coaching positions all filled, the league turns its attention to the annual quarterback carousel — Derek Carr hit the open market Tuesday with his release from the Las Vegas Raiders — and several teams are looking for a replacement or an upgrade at the position,Tom Brady called it a career last month, insisting he means it this time.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810536,Man hurt in NYC bike path attack says he wanted death too,"NEW YORK (AP) — A Belgian man whose wife lost her legs in a deadly terrorist attack on a New York City bike path said he contemplated suicide after he had largely recovered from his physical wounds. He testified Tuesday as a jury considers the death penalty for the militant Islamic attacker.

            Aristide Melissas testified in a federal court in Manhattan to aid the government’s push for a death sentence for Sayfullo Saipov. If all 12 jurors do not agree to end his life, the 35-year-old will automatically spend life in prison.

            Melissas said he was undergoing 22 months of rehabilitation from physical wounds that included a fractured skull when he hit an 18-month stretch of mental lows “where I thought of ending my life.”











            “Then I said: ‘Don’t do it. You have family. You're strong. Seek help,'” he said.

            Saipov was convicted in late January of charges in the Oct. 31, 2017, attack. He drove a rental truck on a lower Manhattan bike path along the Hudson River at high speed, boasting hours afterward to FBI agents that he had hoped to kill more people. Prosecutors say he had become immersed online in Islamic State group propaganda.

            As part of a weeklong presentation of evidence meant to persuade jurors to elect the death penalty, prosecutors have called survivors like Melissas to describe their continuing pain.

            They also have argued that Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, remains dangerous and committed to terrorism, even while incarcerated.

            Two women who worked at federal jails where Saipov has been held since his arrest say he scared them with his antics after he got angry.

            One said he was so angry about his encounter with a guard the night before that he said he wouldn't remove a covering he had placed over the cell's video camera until the guard's head was cut off.

            Another jail employee who works as a guard testified that Saipov once became so angry that he kicked his cell door repeatedly and struck a window so hard that it cracked as he threatened to cut her head off. 

            Melissas, who testified earlier in the trial as did his wife, returned to the witness stand as prosecutors tried to demonstrate the continuing pain felt by a dozen and a half individuals seriously injured in the attack.

            Melissas said he was riding bikes with his wife, his youngest son and a nephew when he heard loud screeching and crashing noises behind him before he was knocked out, only to regain consciousness in a pool of his own blood as a stranger's voice told him an ambulance would arrive soon.

            The one-time chief executive of his family's business said he can no longer work a full day. And each night, he misses cuddling up to his wife's feet so much that he seeks comfort by holding the socks she wore the night before she lost her legs.

            “It doesn't change anything,” he said, alluding to what was lost. “I still love her so much.”NEW YORK (AP) — A Belgian man whose wife lost her legs in a deadly terrorist attack on a New York City bike path said he contemplated suicide after he had largely recovered from his physical wounds.

There could be further people alive still to find, said one rescuer.But U.N. authorities have said the rescue phase is coming to a close, with the focus turning to shelter, food and schooling.""People are suffering a lot. We applied to receive a tent, aid, or something, but up to now we didn't receive anything,"" said Hassan Saimoua, a refugee staying with his family in a playground in Turkey's southeastern city of Gaziantep.Saimoua and other Syrians who had found refuge in Gaziantep from the war at home but were made homeless by the quake used plastic sheets, blankets and cardboard to erect makeshift tents in the playground.""The needs are huge, increasing by the hour,"" said Hans Henri P. Kluge, the World Health Organization's director for Europe. ""Some 26 million people across both countries need humanitarian assistance.""""There are also growing concerns over emerging health issues linked to the cold weather, hygiene and sanitation, and the spread of infectious diseases - with vulnerable people especially at risk.""'DAD, AFTERSHOCK!'At a Turkish field hospital in the southern city of Iskenderun, Indian Army Major Beena Tiwari said patients had initially arrived with physical injuries but that was changing.""Now more of the patients are coming with post-traumatic stress disorder, following all the shock that they've gone through during the earthquake,"" she said.Families in both Turkey and Syria said they and their children were dealing with the psychological aftermath of the quake.""Whenever he forgets, he hears a loud sound and then remembers again,"" Hassan Moaz said of his 9-year-old in Aleppo, Syria. ""When he's sleeping at night and hears a sound, he wakes up and tells me: 'Dad, aftershock!'""A first convoy of U.N. aid entered rebel-held northwest Syria from Turkey via the newly-opened Bab al-Salam crossing.Syrian President Bashar al-Assad agreed on Monday to allow U.N. aid to enter from Turkey via two more border crossings, marking a shift for Damascus which has long opposed cross-border aid deliveries to the rebel enclave.Nearly 9 million people in Syria were affected by the earthquake, the United Nations said, as it launched a $400 million funding appeal.SURVIVORS' EXODUSThe search for survivors was about to end in the north west of Syria, said the head of the White Helmets main rescue group, Raed al Saleh.Russia also said it was wrapping up its search and rescue work in Turkey and Syria and preparing to withdraw.The Turkish toll was 35,3418 killed, Erdogan said. More than 5,814 have died in Syria, according to a Reuters tally of reports from Syrian state media and a U.N. agency.Survivors joined a mass exodus from earthquake-hit zones, leaving their homes and unsure if they can ever come back.""It's very hard ... We will start from zero, without belongings, without a job,"" said 22-year-old Hamza Bekry, a Syrian originally from Idlib who has lived in Antakya, in southern Turkey, for 12 years but prepared to follow his family to Isparta in southern Turkey.More than 2.2 million people have left the worst-hit areas already, Erdogan said, and hundreds of thousands of buildings have become uninhabitable.",2023/02/15,182,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810553,"Alaska Native leaders, US senators back major oil project","JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) — Alaska's Republican U.S. senators and several Alaska Native leaders on Tuesday urged the federal government to approve a major oil project on the petroleum-rich North Slope, casting the project as economically critical for Indigenous communities in the region and important for the nation's energy security. 

            The Biden administration ""damn well better not kill the project, period,” Sen. Lisa Murkowski told reporters on a video conference.

            The U.S. Bureau of Land Management earlier this month released an environmental review for ConocoPhillips Alaska's Willow project that listed as a preferred alternative an option calling for up to three drill sites initially, compared to the five that had been favored by the company. It is an option project proponents, including Alaska's bipartisan congressional delegation, have expressed support for. But Murkowski and Sen. Dan Sullivan said any further limiting of the project could kill it.











            The Bureau of Land Management noted its listing of a preferred alternative “does not constitute a commitment or decision."" The U.S. Interior Department said separately that it had “substantial concerns” about the project and the report’s preferred alternative, “including direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions and impacts to wildlife and Alaska Native subsistence.” The Bureau of Land Management falls under Interior.

            There is disagreement about the project. Leaders in Nuiqsut, about 36 miles (58 kilometers) from the Willow project, have expressed concerns. So have environmentalists, who say approval would lead to further development and be inconsistent with President Joe Biden’s climate goals. 

            Sullivan has said Willow could be “one of the biggest, most important resource development projects in our state’s history.” He last week urged state lawmakers in Alaska’s capital to pass a resolution expressing support for the project and to get involved in litigation that is likely to arise from whatever decision is rendered by the federal government. A decision could come in early March.

            Taqulik Hepa, director of the Department of Wildlife Management for the North Slope Borough, said taxes levied on oil and gas infrastructure have enabled the borough to invest in public infrastructure, support local schools and provide police, fire and other services. 

            Hepa said the borough and its residents are “keenly aware of the need to balance responsible oil development and the subsistence lifestyle that has sustained us.” She said the borough has demanded this balance be achieved in its dealings with government agencies and oil companies for decades. 

            Nagruk Harcharek, president of the group Voice of the Arctic Iñupiat, whose members include leaders from across much of the North Slope, said there is “majority consensus” in the region in favor of the project, calling Willow a “lifeline” for residents. He said there are limited economic development opportunities in the region, which makes approval of the Willow project important.

            Sullivan, in a speech on the U.S. Senate floor last week, said the voices of those who support the project aren't being given enough attention. He complained that national media outlets find “the one who's against it and quote her.”

            City of Nuiqsut Mayor Rosemary Ahtuangaruak said there are “many who would like to say everybody in Alaska supports oil and gas development. Well, for our village, this development is in the wrong area.” 

            “Our concerns are real. It’s about our way of life, the life, health and safety of our village,” she said.

            Biden earlier this month said the U.S. would need oil “for at least another decade.″ Murkowski said there is a move to transition toward a “different energy future” but said Biden needs to “recheck his facts, respectfully.""

            “We are decades, decades away from a time that we would be beyond oil resources,"" she said. ""The need is very, very much still there.”

            She and Sullivan have said resource development should be done in places with environmental standards like Alaska. 

            The proposed Willow project is in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska. ConocoPhillips Alaska has said it could produce up to 180,000 barrels of oil a day at its peak. It is expected to create up to 2,500 jobs during construction and an estimated 300 permanent jobs, along with generating billions of dollars in revenues for federal, state and local governments, the company has said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810554,NYC Mayor Adams gets split decision in battle against rats,"NEW YORK (AP) — In his battle against rats, New York City Mayor Eric Adams scored a split decision Tuesday when a hearing officer dismissed one summons while upholding another issued by a city inspector citing him for not doing enough to keep rodents at bay from his Brooklyn townhouse.

            In a city where some residents consider rats Public Enemy No. 1, the mayor's own troubles with rodents has been the source of amusement among those keeping score of the city's mostly losing battle against the vermin.

            The hearing officer, noting the thousands of dollars Adams has invested in addressing his rat problems, credited the mayor for taking “credible” steps to control the rat population at his rental property.











            But the hearing officer admonished the mayor for not sufficiently heeding his health department's advice for the proper disposal of trash and recyclables, saying that “the presence of several bags on the ground could provide shelter or protection for rodents, which amounts to a harborage condition.”

            For that offense, the hearing officer ordered Adams to pay a $300 fine.

            The mayor's spokesperson, Fabien Levy, said in a statement the mayor was “grateful” that one of the summonses was dismissed. The mayor would consider his options about the second decision, Levy said, adding: “One decision is clear, however: The mayor still hates rats.”

            Last week, Adams via telephone contested the two summonses he got on Dec. 7, just a day after another hearing officer dismissed an earlier $300 ticket for failing to control the rat population at the same property.

            Participating via telephone, Adams contested the findings of an inspector who found rat burrows along a fence line and “fresh rat droppings” in front of the mayor’s garbage bins.

            Adams denied he has a rat problem, telling the hearing officer last week that his own inspections produced no signs of rodents.

            The hearing officer was swayed by the the mayor's arguments that he's made good efforts to address rodents at his property, which he rents out.

            Adams said he pays an exterminator monthly and spent $7,000 a year ago to keep the property rodent-free and produced receipts showing that he continued to rely on outside expertise to assure the his property would remain free of rats.

            Before he became mayor, Adams, as the Brooklyn borough president, was known for his dislike of rats. He famously turned stomachs when he demonstrated a trap for reporters that relied on a bucket filled with a vinegary, toxic soup to drown rats lured by the scent of food.

            The trap wasn’t very effective, nor was every other attempt by previous mayors to vanquish the city’s rat population.

            Adams has often professed his dislike for rats. Last fall, he began looking for a rat czar to help him control the city's rat population.

            “Let’s be clear: I hate rats, and we have too many of them and we have to get rid of them,” he said in June while announcing a proposed city spending plan.NEW YORK (AP) — In his battle against rats, New York City Mayor Eric Adams scored a split decision Tuesday when a hearing officer dismissed one summons while upholding another issued by a city inspector citing him for not doing enough to keep rodents at bay from his Brooklyn townhouse.In a city where some residents consider rats Public Enemy No. 1, the mayor's own troubles with rodents has been the source of amusement among those keeping score of the city's mostly losing battle against the vermin.The hearing officer, noting the thousands of dollars Adams has invested in addressing his rat problems, credited the mayor for taking “credible” steps to control the rat population at his rental property.But the hearing officer admonished the mayor for not sufficiently heeding his health department's advice for the proper disposal of trash and recyclables, saying that “the presence of several bags on the ground could provide shelter or protection for rodents, which amounts to a harborage condition.”For that offense, the hearing officer ordered Adams to pay a $300 fine.The mayor's spokesperson, Fabien Levy, said in a statement the mayor was “grateful” that one of the summonses was dismissed.

He famously turned stomachs when he demonstrated a trap for reporters that relied on a bucket filled with a vinegary, toxic soup to drown rats lured by the scent of food.The trap wasn’t very effective, nor was every other attempt by previous mayors to vanquish the city’s rat population.Adams has often professed his dislike for rats. Last fall, he began looking for a rat czar to help him control the city's rat population.“Let’s be clear: I hate rats, and we have too many of them and we have to get rid of them,” he said in June while announcing a proposed city spending plan.",2023/02/15,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810559,Zelenskiy urges speedy help from allies as Russia pounds Ukraine's east,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged allies to be speedy in sending more military help as NATO defence ministers met on Wednesday and Russia bombarded the eastern front line in what appeared to be the early salvoes of a new offensive.Much of Russia's artillery fire was focused on Bakhmut, a bombed-out city in Donetsk province and a principal target for President Vladimir Putin. Ukrainian troops there have fortified positions in anticipation of street fighting.Bakhmut's capture would provide a stepping stone for Russia to advance on two bigger Donetsk cities, Kramatorsk and Sloviansk, and give Moscow momentum after months of battlefield setbacks following its invasion last February.NATO defence ministers were meeting in Brussels to discuss the war and stockpiles. Zelenskiy said Russia was in a hurry to achieve as much as it could with its latest push before Ukraine and its allies could gather strength.""That is why speed is of the essence,"" he said in an evening video address.""Speed in everything - adopting decisions, carrying out decisions, shipping supplies, training. Speed saves people's lives, speed brings back security, and I thank all our partners who realize that speed is important.""Ukraine is using shells faster than the West can make them.U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said he expected Ukraine to launch its own offensive against Russia in the spring and Kyiv's allies were working to ensure they had the armour, firepower and logistics to make it effective.""Ukraine has urgent requirements to help it meet this crucial moment in the course of the war. We believe there'll be a window of opportunity for them to exercise initiative,"" Austin told the meeting of defence ministers.NATO Chief Jens Stoltenberg said Putin was ""preparing for more war, for new offensives and new attacks.""With the first anniversary of Russia's invasion nearing, the Kremlin has intensified operations across a broad swathe of southern and eastern Ukraine, and a major new offensive has been widely anticipated.In its evening report, the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces said Russian forces trained mortar and artillery fire on more than 20 towns and villages in the Bakhmut part of the front line, including the city itself.They also launched missile strikes on the industrial cities Kostyantynivka and Kramatorsk in Donetsk, it said.Russian forces had made incremental progress in their assault on Bahkmut, White House spokesperson John Kirby said.Britain said on Tuesday mercenaries from the Wagner Group, who have spearheaded the Russian assault on Bakhmut, had made small gains in its northern outskirts in the past three days.Wagner head Yevgeny Prigozhin said Russian forces would not be able to capture the town anytime soon. In a post on the Telegram platform, Prigozhin said Ukraine was reinforcing with up to 500 new fighters a day.MORE MILITARY AID?Promised battle tanks last month, Ukraine is also desperate for fighter jets and longer-range missiles to nip any significant new Russian offensive in the bud and help turn the tide against Moscow's far superior firepower.Germany appeared to quash Kyiv's hopes for fighter jets now when its defence minister said that was not a focus at the moment but would certainly be discussed.""Only when the skies over Ukraine remain safe over the next three, four months, then you can talk about all other further steps,"" he said on Tuesday.The Kremlin, which calls the invasion a ""special military operation"" to eliminate security threats, said NATO was demonstrating its hostility towards Russia every day and was becoming more and more involved in the conflict.Kyiv and its allies call Russia's actions an unprovoked land grab.Ukrainian officials also said the Russians had suffered big losses around Vuhledar, a town 150 km (90 miles) southwest of Bakhmut, including tanks, armoured vehicles and personnel.Reuters was unable to independently verify battlefield reports.On the snowbound Ukrainian front line between Vuhledar and Marinka 30 km to the northeast, and 400 metres (1,300 feet) from Russian positions, two officers said Kyiv's forces were holding firm against intensifying Russian artillery and mortar fire.Russia now holds swathes of the southern regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, including its nuclear plant, nearly all of Luhansk and over half of Donetsk, including the regional capital.A U.S.-backed report published on Tuesday said Russia has held at least 6,000 Ukrainian children - likely many more - in sites in Crimea and Russia whose primary purpose appears to be political re-education.Russia's embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.(Reporting by Caleb Davis, Sabine Siebold, Pavel Polityuk, Ron Popeski, Lydia Kelly, Aleksandar Vasovic, Tassilo Hummel, Steve Holland, Doina Chiacu, Ron Popeski and David Ljunggren; Writing by Costas Pitas; Editing by Caitlin Webber)",2023/02/15,141,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810564,NBA announces All-Star Saturday night participants,"Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo is teaming up with his brothers once again on All-Star Saturday. Portland's Damian Lillard is taking a third shot at the 3-point title, Indiana's Buddy Hield will aim to win that one again and Philadelphia's Mac McClung now can be a slam-dunk champion at the NBA and high school levels.

            The NBA released the full list of participants for All-Star Saturday's events in Salt Lake City — the Skills Competition, the 3-point contest and the dunk contest. It'll be a particularly busy weekend for 11 players who are now slotted to be in multiple events during the three days of action in Utah.

            3-POINT CONTEST











            Hield, the 2020 winner, is back to try to become the eighth player with multiple 3-point crowns. He'll face his Indiana teammate Tyrese Haliburton, the Portland duo of Lillard and Anfernee Simons, Miami's Tyler Herro, Sacramento's Kevin Huerter, Utah's Lauri Markkanen and Boston's Jayson Tatum.

            Huerter is one of four Kings picked to be part of the weekend.

            “It's exciting to be part of it and to help represent the Kings at All-Star weekend,"" Huerter said. “We're off to a great start, we can't wait to see what this weekend is about and then we can't wait to get back to work.""

            Herro said he's eager to get to Salt Lake City.

            “I'm excited. I'm going to try to win it,"" the Heat guard said. “I'm just going to be me and I'll be good. Shooters shoot.""

            SKILLS CHALLENGE

            Antetokounmpo is an All-Star captain, and will choose a team to oppose the squad that will be picked Sunday night by fellow captain LeBron James.

            But first, he'll be teaming up with his brothers — Thanasis and Alex — in the Skills Challenge, just as he did in last year's event at Cleveland. They'll face two other teams, one from the host Utah Jazz and the other composed of three top picks in last year's draft.

            The Jazz will be represented by Jordan Clarkson, Walker Kessler and Collin Sexton. And Team Rooks is composed of No. 1 pick Paolo Banchero of Orlando, No. 3 pick Jabari Smith Jr. of Houston and No. 5 pick Jaden Ivey of Detroit.

            It's a four-round competition, the first three involve shooting, passing and a relay. The top two teams after those events will then shoot half-court shots to decide a winner.

            DUNK CONTEST

            McClung won an All-American high school dunk contest in 2018, and will be joined in the NBA dunk field by Houston's Kenyon Martin Jr., New Orleans' Trey Murphy III and New York's Jericho Sims.

            BUSY WEEKENDS

            Giannis Antetokounmpo will be in two events at the All-Star weekend, with the skills event followed by the All-Star Game itself the next night.

            Also in both All-Star Saturday and the All-Star Game: Tatum, Haliburton, Lillard and Markkanen.

            It’ll be a doubleheader weekend for six other players scheduled to take part in both Friday’s Rising Stars games and the All-Star Saturday events: Ivey, Smith, Murphy, McClung, Banchero and Kessler.

            REFEREES

            John Goble, Mark Lindsay and Michael Smith were announced Tuesday as referees for Sunday’s All-Star Game.

            The tasks of officiating the Rising Stars games and the All-Star Saturday events will be handled by Brandon Adair, Ashley Moyer-Gleich and CJ Washington.

            SNUBBED

            Brooklyn, Charlotte and Washington have no representatives heading to All-Star weekend. For the Nets, it's a technicality — Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant were both selected as All-Stars this year while they played for the Nets, and both have subsequently been traded.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810565,New Mexico State fires coach in wake of hazing allegations,"New Mexico State fired basketball coach Greg Heiar on Tuesday in the wake of hazing allegations within the team that shut down the program for the rest of the season. 

            Chancellor Dan Arvizu announced the firing of the first-year coach and said “hazing has no place on our campus, and those found responsible will be held accountable for their actions.”

            The chancellor said decisions about the rest of the coaching staff will be made after further investigation.











            Arvizu shut down the program for the season on Sunday, after reviewing a campus police report in which an Aggies player said three teammates ganged up on him and attacked him. The report, which redacted the names of the players, included allegations of false imprisonment, harassment and criminal sexual contact.

            The 47-year-old Heiar spent time earlier in his career as an assistant for former Aggies coach Chris Jans, who left after last season to coach Mississippi State. Last season, Heiar was at Northwest Florida State, where he helped the Raiders win the junior college national title.

            He brought two highly ranked players with him from the juco ranks, Issa Muhammad and Deshawndre Washington (another player, Marchelus Avery, had moved over from Northwest Florida the season before), but the Aggies were riddled with problems almost from the start of their season.

            It started unraveling when some basketball players were involved in a fight with New Mexico students at an Aggies football game in October.

            A month later, the night before New Mexico State basketball was scheduled to play at New Mexico in Albuquerque, forward Mike Peake went to the apartment complex of one of the students involved in the fight. Security cameras at the apartment complex shows the student pulling a gun, then Peake brandishing own gun and shooting the student, inflicting fatal wounds. Peake was taken to the hospital with leg wounds.

            Peake has been suspended from the team but not charged with a crime while authorities in Albuquerque investigate. New Mexico State has hired an independent investigator to look into the circumstances surrounding the killing. 

            The hazing allegations came less than three months after the shooting in Albuquerque. The police report says the hazing victim described teammates removing “his clothing exposing his buttocks and began to slap his (buttocks). He also went on to state that they also touched his scrotum.”

            The Aggies were 9-15 when the season was first put on hold before a scheduled game last Saturday at California Baptist.

            The Western Athletic Conference is counting New Mexico State's final six games as forfeits. The team is supposed to move into the bigger, more high-profile Conference USA next season — a move that seemed like a good fit for a program that has a long tradition of strong basketball teams. New Mexico State has made 26 trips to the NCAA Tournament and reached the Sweet 16 five times.

            But there have also been problems checkered throughout the history of a program that has long depended on juco transfers and players looking for second chances. An academic scandal in the 1990s brought about the quick end to the otherwise successful tenure of coach Neil McCarthy. It led to relative stability during the second of two long tenures in Las Cruces by coaching stalwart Lou Henson. 

            Most of Henson's successors, including Marvin Menzies, Reggie Theus and Jans, enjoyed success before leaving for bigger opportunities. 

            There has been similar turnover in the administration. Just over the past 14 months, the university provost and president have resigned or been removed from their positions. And Arivzu, the chancellor, is on his way out in June after the regents declined to renew his contract. He said the school will investigate the hazing allegations. 

            “We will work to ensure we fully understand what happened here, and that those found responsible are held accountable,” he said. “We will also ensure that support systems are in place to prevent this from happening again.”

(AP) — The deadly crash of a commercial tanker truck caused hazardous material to leak onto Interstate 10 outside Tucson on Tuesday, shutting down the key highway through Arizona and forcing evacuations near the accident.

            Residents within a half mile (800 meters) were ordered to leave and those within a mile (1.6 kilometers) were told to shelter in place for several hours after liquid nitric acid was determined to be leaking from the tanker, the Arizona Department of Public Safety said.

            The Tuesday afternoon accident happened on a stretch of I-10 southeast of downtown Tucson.











            The shelter-in-place order was lifted Tuesday night but “those who have already been evacuated will remain evacuated,” the agency said.

            The driver of the truck was killed, the department said, but few other details were released. 

            The agency warned motorists in the Tucson area should anticipate impacts on their Wednesday morning commute in and around I-10.

            “This will be an extended closure,” it said in a tweet Tuesday evening.

            The University of Arizona Tech Park was among the areas evacuated. Some schoolchildren in Rita Ranch were among those who sheltered in place, the Arizona Daily Star reported.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810578,Police: Texas not alerted when Nevada stabbing suspect moved,"LAS VEGAS (AP) — Texas authorities claim Nevada law enforcement failed to inform them when a woman accused of stabbing a man inside a Las Vegas-area hotel room in an apparent act of revenge relocated to Dallas.

            Nika Nikoubin, 22, has been on house arrest in Texas since at least June 2022 after posting bond and being released from a Las Vegas jail, court records show. She has pleaded not guilty to attempted murder and battery in connection with the March 5, 2022, stabbing at a casino-hotel southeast of Las Vegas.

            Nikoubin told detectives at the time of her arrest that she stabbed a man she met on a dating app to avenge the death of an Iranian military leader who died in an American drone strike two years earlier, police have said. The man survived.











            A judge in Henderson, on the outskirts of Las Vegas, imposed a curfew for Nikoubin and said she could leave home only for work, counseling, medical appointments and school if she was released from jail. Nikoubin moved to Dallas. 

            At a status hearing Monday in Clark County District Court, a police detective for the University of Texas at Dallas revealed that law enforcement agencies in Dallas were not made aware of Nikoubin's pending criminal case in Nevada, KLAS-TV reported.

            “That has sparked immediate concerns for the safety of the campus along with the community,” the detective, Rod Bishop, said.

            Judge Carli Kierny questioned whether Nikoubin, an aspiring music artist, has been properly monitored since she was released from jail in Las Vegas. 

            KLAS-TV reported that Nikoubin, while under house arrest, has left her home to record music videos and perform.

            Bishop said that campus police learned Nikoubin was under house arrest in Dallas only when a reporter reached out for comment regarding the community's safety after Nikoubin booked “a singing event,” according to court records.

            Nikoubin’s attorney, Alanna Bondy, asked the judge on Monday to release her client from house arrest, saying she has not violated any of the conditions of her release from jail. Bondy also said her performances are considered work, KLAS-TV reported.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810579,New Zealand fears more fatalities after cyclone kills 4,"WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — A cyclone that left a devastating wake of extensive flooding and landslides in New Zealand has claimed at least four lives and police have “grave concerns” for other residents who remain unaccounted for, the prime minister said on Wednesday.

            
                Cyclone Gabrielle struck the country’s north on Monday and has brought more destruction to this nation of 5 million than any weather event in decades.

            Police said at least four people had been confirmed killed by the storm, including a child caught in rising water on Tuesday at Eskdale on Hawke’s Bay. All four fatalities occurred near the same North Island east coast bay, two in landslides and two by drowning.











            A weather station in the Hawke’s Bay region recorded three times more rain over Monday night than usually falls for the entire month of February, authorities said.

            Prime Minister Chris Hipkins said it was unclear how many people remained unaccounted for, with several communities still isolated by floodwaters, landslides and telecommunications outages.

            Police said 1,442 people had been reported uncontactable in the North Island as of Wednesday afternoon. 

            “We expect the vast majority of these people will be accounted for. However, there are several people missing for whom police do hold grave concerns,” Hipkins told reporters.

            Hipkins said he could not put a figure on how many missing person reports were of grave concern.

            He said 1,111 people had been reported found by Wednesday, which would cancel out some of those reported uncontactable. Around 9,000 people have been forced from their homes since Monday.

            More than 300 people were rescued Tuesday from the Hawke’s Bay area, including 60 stranded on a single roof, an official said. The final 25 rescues of individuals and family groups were expected to be completed on Wednesday.

            Hipkins said seven rescues had yet to be completed by late Wednesday. He did not say how many people had yet to be retrieved, but said none was in danger.

            “The feedback that we’ve had is that those seven that are still outstanding, all of the people concerned are safe,” Hipkins said.

            “The people who were on rooftops and precarious positions have been rescued,” he added.

            Along with rescues, the government was prioritizing restoring power and telecommunications as well as delivering food, water and medicine to where it was needed, Hipkins said.

            A naval ship left Auckland late Wednesday with drinking water for Hawke’s Bay communities and another ship would follow with vital supplies on Thursday.

            A helicopter would drop bottled water for 3,000 people on Wednesday night.

            Emergency responders planned to hold a barbecue for 3,000 people on Wednesday night at the Hawke’s Bay town of Wairoa.

            “They’ll keep cooking into the night until either they run out of people to feed or they run out of food,” Hipkins said.

            Water treatment equipment would also be delivered to Wairoa on Thursday, he said.

            Around 160,000 properties on the North Island were without power on Wednesday, down from 225,000 on Tuesday, the government said.

            British King Charles III’s sister Princess Anne visited New Zealand’s disaster management headquarters in the capital, Wellington, on Wednesday and praised the nation’s response. Her visit to New Zealand was scheduled before the cyclone struck.

            “My thoughts are with all New Zealanders whose homes or livelihoods have been affected by Cyclone Gabrielle,” she said in a statement.

            “I admire the courage of the people of Aotearoa during this alarming and difficult time,” she said, using the country’s Māori-language name.

            “You should all be proud of the resilience, strength and care for your communities you are showing in the face of adversity,” she added.

            Auckland was swamped two weeks ago by a record-breaking storm that also killed four people.

            A national emergency was declared Tuesday, enabling the government to support affected regions and provide additional resources.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810581,Haitian offers guilty plea in 2018 New Mexico compound raid,"SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) — A Haitian woman has signed a tentative agreement to plead guilty to weapons charges in exchange for a reduced sentence more than four years after authorities arrested her and four other adults from an extended family at a squalid New Mexico compound and recovered the remains of a 3-year-old boy.

            Jany Leveille would accept a potential prison sentence of 12-15 years and possible fines under the proposed agreement with prosecutors from the U.S. Attorney's Office in Albuquerque that dismisses kidnapping and terrorism-related charges.

            Approval of the agreement is still pending in U.S. District Court. Prosecutors could withdraw from the agreement based on responses to proposed plea agreements with four additional defendants who say they are innocent of all charges, the U.S. Attorney's Office confirmed Tuesday. A deadline passed last week without additional plea agreements to avoid trial.











            Leveille was arrested along with her partner Siraj Ibn Wahhaj and extended family members in a law enforcement raid in August 2018 on a ramshackle encampment in the remote desert surrounded by berms of used tires and an adjacent firing range.

            Authorities were searching for a sickly 3-year-old who had been reported missing by his mother in Georgia. Sheriff’s deputies and state agents initially found 11 hungry children and a small arsenal of ammunition and guns. After days of searching, they recovered the decomposed remains of the 3-year-old in an underground tunnel.

            Authorities have said the deceased child, Abdul-Ghani Wahhaj, suffered from untreated disabilities as father Siraj Ibn Wahhaj and Leveille performed daily prayer rituals over him — even as he cried and foamed at the mouth. Authorities also said Leveille believed medication suppressed the group’s Muslim beliefs.

            Forensic specialists determined the child died several months prior to the recovery of his body.

            Leveille was accused of flouting prohibitions on firearms possession and transportation based on her status as a Haitian national without legal standing in the U.S. after she overstayed a visa without seeking renewal. Convictions also could result in her removal from the U.S.

            An initial grand jury indictment alleges Leveille and her partner instructed people at the compound to be prepared to engage in jihad and die as martyrs, and that one more relative was invited to bring money and firearms.

            All five defendants were charged with conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States and providing material support to each other as potential terrorists by crossing state lines with firearms and training at the New Mexico compound.

            Defense attorneys have said their clients would not be facing terrorism-related charges if they were not Muslim.

            All five defendants have been found competent to stand trial after mental health evaluations.

This comes roughly three months after Berkshire unveiled it bought more than $4.1 billion worth of TSMC stock, which sent shares of the world's largest contract chipmaker soaring.
TSMC depository receipts fell 4% in U.S. after hours trade on Tuesday. In Taiwan, TSMC shares opened down 3.3% as Asian markets started Wednesday trading.
Depositary shares in TSMC, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment, have surged almost 32% this year, closing at $97.96 on Tuesday.
""Berkshire made a small profit on TSMC. It was not a huge, huge win for Berkshire,"" said Cathy Seifert, a CFRA Research analyst. According to her calculations, Berkshire bought it for roughly $68.5 and sold for $74.5.
It is rare but not unprecedented for Berkshire to quickly undo a multi-billion dollar investment in a company's stock. In the first quarter of 2022, Berkshire sold nearly all of what had been an $8.3 billion stake in Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) that it amassed in late 2020.
TSMC last month said revenue in the first quarter is likely to dip 5% as it weathers a global downturn in the chip industry because of softening consumer demand for electronics. TSMC executives have said they do not expect market conditions to improve until the second half of the year.
Besides TSMC, Buffett also divested 91.4% of its shares in US Bancorp (USB.N), to 6.7 million shares, and shrunk its stake in BNY Mellon by roughly 60%, to 25.1 million shares. Both cuts totaled nearly $5.5 billion at current prices.
Buffett's conglomerate also holds shares in Citigroup Inc (C.N), Bank of America (BAC.N) and Jefferies (JEF.N).
Berkshire trimmed some positions across its portfolio of U.S. listed companies, including Chevron (CVX.N), Activision Blizzard (ATVI.O), maker of the ""Call of Duty"" video game, and Kroger (KR.N).
Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) is making efforts to conclude the acquisition of Activision Blizzard. On Feb. 21, Microsoft will defend the deal in front of European Union and national antitrust officials at a closed hearing.
Among Berkshire's few additions are Apple, which Buffett views more as a consumer products company. Berkshire bought another 20.8 million Apple shares worth $3.2 billion, raising its stake to 5.8%, according to the filing.
Shares in Apple have surged nearly 18% this year.
Berkshire also disclosed a new stake of $84 million in building materials company Louisiana-Pacific Corp (LPX.N).TAIPEI, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Shares in Taiwan's TSMC (2330.TW), opened 3.3% lower on Wednesday after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) slashed its stake in the chipmaker.Berkshire cut its position in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) by 86.2% to 8.29 million sponsored American depositary shares, a regulatory filing showed. read moreTSMC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.NEW YORK/BANGALORE, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) slashed its stake in Taiwanese contract chipmaker TSMC (2330.TW), as well as in some banks in the fourth quarter, while bolstering its holdings in Apple Inc (AAPL.O).Berkshire cut its position in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) by 86.2% to 8.29 million sponsored American depositary shares, according to a regulatory filing.This comes roughly three months after Berkshire unveiled it bought more than $4.1 billion worth of TSMC stock, which sent shares of the world's largest contract chipmaker soaring.TSMC depository receipts fell 4% in U.S. after hours trade on Tuesday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810584,Diplomatic spat deepens as U.S. examines Chinese balloon debris,"BEIJING/WASHINGTON, Feb 14 (Reuters) - A diplomatic rift between China and the United States deepened on Tuesday with Beijing accusing Washington of flying high-altitude balloons into its airspace and that of other countries, as the U.S. military examined debris of a suspected Chinese spy balloon it downed this month.The Chinese balloon, which Beijing denies was a spy vessel, spent a week flying over the United States and Canada before President Joe Biden ordered it shot on Feb. 4. The U.S. military has since carried out three more shootdowns as it combs the skies for objects that were not being captured by radar.The White House said on Tuesday it was still searching for debris from the most recent, unmanned objects, and had not seen any indication they were part of China's spy program. But they exposed Washington's heightened sense of alert as the standoff over the balloon delays efforts to reset bilateral relations.China says the balloon shot down on Feb. 4 was a civilian weather-monitoring aircraft. Beijing has accused Washington of sending its own balloons into Chinese airspace, and on Tuesday alleged those objects had flown above other countries as well.U.S. balloons ""flew around the world and illegally entered the airspaces of China and other relevant countries at least ten times"" since May 2022, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said, without providing details or evidence.China asserts numerous disputed territorial claims, including Taiwan and parts of the East and South China Seas, where the U.S. military says it routinely operates according to international law.The White House has disputed China's allegations. Adrienne Watson, spokesperson for the White House National Security Council, tweeted on Monday: ""Any claim that the US government operates surveillance balloons over the PRC is false.""Washington has imposed sanctions on six Chinese entities it says are tied to the balloon, an action which drew criticism from Beijing on Tuesday. But there are some signs the two countries are still seeking to inject stability into turbulent relations.Biden, who has repeatedly vowed to protect U.S. airspace and criticized China over the balloon, has also said that he does not believe relations between the two countries were weakened by the incident.U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who postponed a planned trip to Beijing over the balloon, is considering meeting China's top diplomat Wang Yi in Munich this week, sources said.'COMMERCIAL OR BENIGN PURPOSE'The U.S. military said on Monday it had recovered critical electronics from the suspected Chinese spy balloon as well as large sections of the vessel itself.But it has not yet recovered debris from the most recent three objects shot down, with tough weather conditions making recovery operations difficult.White House spokesperson John Kirby told reporters on Tuesday that no group or individual has claimed the three objects, and that the U.S. intelligence community believes they could be ""tied to some commercial or benign purpose.""The objects include an object downed over sea ice near Deadhorse, Alaska, one brought down over Canada's Yukon and a third shot down over Lake Huron.Demonstrating the difficulty of taking down the three objects, the top U.S. general, Mark Milley, said the first of two missiles fired from an F-16 fighter jet at the object over Lake Huron on Sunday missed the object, but landed harmlessly in the water.""We certainly tracked it all the way down,"" Milley told a news conference in Brussels on Tuesday.Top U.S. defense and military officials held a classified briefing for U.S. senators at the Capitol on Tuesday. Republican senators urged Biden, a Democrat, to publicly share more information about the objects.""Ninety-fivepercent of what was discussed in that room today can be made public without compromising the security of this country,"" Republican Senator Marco Rubio said after the briefing.",2023/02/15,439,World

According to the Taipei Economic and Cultural Mission in Ankara, airport and Turkish Airlines staff members also expedited the team’s immigration procedure.Duty free shops even offered “buy one get many free” deals to rescuers.“We will always remember this deep friendship,” the mission wrote in a statement. “Team members have promised to come next time as tourists to enjoy Turkey’s great scenery and warmth.”Prior to leaving Turkey, the rescue team left four tons of equipment it brought with the AKUT, a Turkish NGO for disaster search and rescue relief. The package included tools for excavation and propping up structures, logistic items such as tents and power generators, and medical supplies.Meanwhile, donations for Turkey in Taiwan on Monday (Feb. 13) reached NT$490.64 million (US$16.23 million), the Ministry of Health and Welfare announced. The ministry had set up bank accounts to accept disaster relief funds from the public from Feb. 7 to March 6.There were over 100,000 donations.Tayvan arama kurtarma ekipleri İstanbul Havalimanı’ndan, limandaki tüm yolcu ve çalışanların alkışları eşliğinde uğurlandı pic.twitter.com/YNjs2r9UBG",2023/02/15,1293,Society

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810589,TSMC founder told Pelosi US semiconductor plans 'naive',"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacting Co. (TSMC) founder Morris Chang (張忠謀) told Nancy Pelosi that U.S. plans to spend its way into the semiconductor manufacturing industry were “incredibly naïve” during her August trip to Taiwan, according to reports.According to Politico, Pelosi and Chang were at a luncheon at the Presidential Office when Chang began to voice doubts about the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act, and the planned multi-billion package of subsidies for semiconductor manufacturing.“Fifty billion dollars – well, that’s a good start,” Chang said in front of an audience that included President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文), according to the Politico report. He then went on to press Pelosi with questions, including asking whether or not the U.S. plans represented a genuine commitment to building a globally competitive semiconductor industry, or simply an “impulsive” move to enter a lucrative global market.Chang reportedly explained to Pelosi that establishing a viable semiconductor industry would require more than a one-off cash injection due to the rapid pace at which the industry evolves. He said that once an industry was established, simply obtaining the raw materials needed was an enormous task, and that the task of making the chips was almost “impossibly complicated.”Chang reportedly then said that if the U.S. truly wanted to guarantee security of its semiconductor supply, it should continue to invest in Taiwan’s national security, as TSMC had “long perfected” what America was now trying to establish.Pelosi was reportedly untroubled by the remarks, though acknowledged that other Taiwanese executives expressed reservations about the U.S. plan during the meeting. They specifically questioned whether or not the U.S. environmental and labor laws were sufficient to support such a complicated industry.President Joe Biden talks about bringing chip manufacturing jobs to America after touring the upcoming TSMC facility in the U.S. in Dec. 2022. (AP photo)Washington is also increasing incentives for Taiwan to expand its semiconductor manufacturing operations in the U.S., with TSMC announcing plans to up their investment in Arizona to US$40 billion (NT$1.2 trillion) in December 2022, with a further US$3.5 billion capital injection approved by the TSMC board on Tuesday (Feb. 14). TSMC is planning to have the first Phoenix fab (4nm) ready for commercial production in 2024, while it has also begun construction of a second 3nm fab which is slated to be finished in 2026.The CHIPS (Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors) and Science Act was signed into law by U.S. President Joe Biden in 2022, allocating approximately US$52 billion of subsidies to semiconductor research and manufacturing. The increase in funding comes alongside sweeping U.S. sanctions and controls on the export of semiconductor technology to China, announced in October, which are already impacting Chinese companies.Semiconductors are crucial for developing military hardware, and renewed U.S. interest in semiconductors is seen as part of a move to contain China’s military capabilities.",2023/02/15,3061,Business

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810603,Bazball goes home as England takes on Kiwis in New Zealand,"WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — England cricket coach Brendon McCullum will bring Bazball back to its birthplace in a two-test series against New Zealand which begins Thursday in Mount Maunganui.

            McCullum devised the eponymous strategy of all out attack during his highly-successful term as New Zealand captain when he used it to upend the Black Caps’ traditional conservative approach and underdog mindset.

            The policy, which hadn’t yet been named for “Baz” McCullum, largely reflected his own nature as one of the sport's most attacking batters and his approach to life as a natural bon vivant. McCullum figured if somebody was going to play cricket, it should be fun.











            “In any job you do you want to have fun, or else what’s the point in doing it?” he said. “We get one crack at life. If you’ve got some skills, aspirations and dreams why would you not live those out and have a smile on your face?”

            Bazball has flourished since McCullum transplanted it in England among a team of kindred spirits, willing to risk losing in order to chase a win. England was down on its luck when McCullum became coach but now has won nine of its last 10 test matches.

            McCullum now can display his refined version of Bazball to a New Zealand audience which saw it in its infancy. The move to the pink ball format on Thursday hasn’t pleased all members of the England team: fast bowler Ollie Robinson who is coming to grips with the pink Kookaburra ball called it “gimmicky,”

            “They’re trying to get crowds in and change the game a little bit,” Robinson said. “But the way England are playing test cricket at the moment, I don’t think that needs to happen. We could stick to how we’re going and we’re entertaining people as we are so I’m not sure if it’s necessary really.”

            Preparations for both teams have been affected by Cyclone Gabrielle which ravaged Auckland and New Zealand’s northern region and east coast, leading to the announcement of national state of emergency. The storm brought heavy rain and wind to the Mount Maunganui area, forcing teams to practice indoors.

            New Zealand-born Ben Stokes who leads England is very much McCullum’s protege in the Bazball era and will again pursue an attacking strategy in the coming series. England has lost five of its six previous pink ball tests but Stokes is confident of a positive result from Thursday, weather permitting.

            “I’m sure we’ll still come up with a way to hopefully force a result regardless of how much time is taken away (by weather),” Stokes said.

            McCullum has kept England’s preparation relatively light, spending the first few days of the tour in the South Island resort of Queenstown and taking the team to the races on Saturday to see his horse, Defibrilate, run in a Group One race at Te Rapa. It was among the favorites but finished fourth.

            New Zealand’s preparation has been troubled, made so by bad backs and babies and by travel disruptions which delayed the arrival in Mount Maunganui of some players. The fast bowlers Kyle Jamieson and Matt Henry both are out of the match, Jamieson because of a back injury and Henry because of the birth of his first child.

            Two uncapped players, Jacob Duffy and Scott Kuggeleijn, have been called in as replacements as the New Zealand selectors elected not to call up the uncontracted Trent Boult, who lives close by and is available.

            “It’s been decided since he gave up his contract that we would give priority to contracted players,” New Zealand coach Gary Stead said. “We discussed it internally but our decision was not to go with Trent on this occasion.”

            England has named the 36-year-old swing bowler Stuart Broad in its match XI for his first first-class match since September. He joins James Anderson and Robinson in the pace attack.

            As Gabrielle heads away to the east, the prospect of a major weather disruption eases. A few showers may fall on day one but the rest of the test should be played in sunny and warm conditions.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810604,"In Trump probe, US seeks to pierce attorney-client privilege","WASHINGTON (AP) — Justice Department prosecutors investigating the mishandling of classified documents at Donald Trump's Florida estate are seeking to pierce the attorney-client privilege and want to again question one of the former president's lawyers before a grand jury, a person familiar with the matter said Tuesday night.

            The privilege protects lawyers from having to tell prosecutors about confidential conversations their clients have with them. But prosecutors can get around that privilege if they can convince a judge that the communications they want information about were made in furtherance of a crime — a principle known as the crime-fraud exception.

            Prosecutors have already questioned M. Evan Corcoran before a grand jury, but he repeatedly invoked attorney-client privilege in declining to answer certain questions, according to the person who spoke with The Associated Press and insisted on anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation. They're seeking to question him again, and want to be able to move past attorney-client privilege, the person said.











            The request from prosecutors working with special counsel Jack Smith is expected to lead to closed-door arguments before the chief judge of the District of Columbia federal court about whether prosecutors can compel Corcoran to answer their questions about his conversations with Trump. 

            It is not the first time during the course of the investigation prosecutors have raised the specter of criminal conduct in connection with the Mar-a-Lago investigation. Last August the Justice Department revealed in a search warrant affidavit that it had probable cause to investigate the unlawful retention of national defense information as well as efforts to obstruct that probe.

            It remains unclear whether Trump or anyone else will be charged, though the move is a notably aggressive act by Smith's team. A war crimes prosecutor who previously led the Justice Department's public corruption section, Smith is separately investigating efforts by Trump and his allies to overturn the results of the 2020 election and recently subpoenaed former Vice President Mike Pence as part of that probe.

            A spokesman for Smith did not return a call seeking comment Tuesday night, and Corcoran did not return an email seeking comment.

            Trump's lawyers and representatives have featured prominently for months in the investigation into the retention by Trump of roughly 300 documents with classified markings at Mar-a-Lago. The Justice Department issued a subpoena last May to recover any remaining classified documents at Mar-a-Lago, but officials who visited the property were given a folder containing only about three dozen records.

            One of Trump’s lawyers, Christina Bobb, signed a letter stating that a “diligent search” had been conducted for classified documents and that all such records had been returned to the government. She told FBI investigators in an interview last fall that she had had not drafted the letter and that Corcoran was the one who prepared it and asked her to sign it in her role as custodian of records.

            But Justice Department say they subsequently developed evidence that led them to suspect that additional classified records remained at the property. FBI agents returned in August with a search warrant, removing roughly 100 documents with classified markings.

            The New York Times first reported that the Justice Department was seeking to pierce attorney-client privilege.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810605,Idaho House passes ban on gender-affirming medical care,"BOISE, Idaho (AP) — A bill criminalizing gender-affirming healthcare for minors overwhelmingly passed the Idaho House Thursday, despite warnings from opponents who said it would likely increase suicide rates among teens. 

            The bill, which would subject physicians to felony charges if they provide puberty blockers, hormone treatment or gender-affirming surgeries to transgender youth under 18, is just one of several targeting Idaho's LGBTQ+ residents this year. Proponents of the bill have acknowledged that gender-affirming surgeries on minors are not currently being performed in Idaho.

            Rep. Bruce Skaug, a Republican from Nampa, said the legislation was needed to “protect children,” and that puberty blockers and hormone treatment could cause permanent harm. But every major medical organization, including the American Medical Association, American Academy of Pediatrics and American Psychiatric Association support gender-affirming care for youth. Many of those organizations have also issued policy statements opposing legislative attempts to limit such care. 











            Republican lawmakers in more than two dozen states have pushed for bans on gender-affirming care this year, targeting what doctors and psychologists widely consider medically necessary care. 

            The bill in Idaho passed on a near party-line vote, with only one Republican voting no. Rep. Matthew Bundy, of Mountain Home, said he voted against it because it did not include a strong enough guarantee that transgender kids and their families would still have access to counseling. 

            Democratic Rep. Chris Mathias, of Boise, said transgender youth already self-harm and take their own lives at disturbingly high rates.

            “This bill is going to throw gasoline on that problem,” he said. 

            A regional Planned Parenthood affiliate said in a statement that the gender-affirming care ban is “one of the most extreme attacks on transgender health care that we’ve seen across the U.S.”

            “Gender affirming care is time sensitive and life-saving,” said Rebecca Gibron, CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Northwest, Hawai’i, Indiana, Kentucky. “Patients, families, and health care providers — no one else — should decide what care is in the best interest of transgender youth, in accordance with current medical best practices.”

            The bill banning gender-affirming care was pushed by the Idaho Family Policy Center, a religious lobbying group that has also advocated for anti-abortion legislation. Blaine Conzatti, the group's president, said in a press release that the organization was excited that a super-majority of state representatives voted in favor of the bill.

            “These children need real help, not medically unnecessary procedures that result in lifelong harms,” Conzatti said.

            The bill now goes to the Senate, where a similar gender-affirming care ban died last year. At the time, the Idaho Senate Republicans issued a statement saying they strongly oppose gender-affirming surgery for children but feared the bill could affect medically necessary care for non-transgender kids, and they did not want to interfere in parents' medical decision-making authority. 

            Several other anti-LGBTQ bills are also still making their way through the Legislature. One would restrict transgender kids' school bathroom access, by barring them from using locker rooms, changing facilities or bathrooms that match their gender. Another bill limits sex education in grade school and prohibits schools from discussing human sexuality, gender identity or sexual orientation before fifth grade. A bill printed Monday could require schools to inform parents if there is a change in a student’s “mental, emotional or physical health or wellbeing,” -- perhaps including if the student discloses they are gay or transgender.

            Parents could sue libraries and public schools for $10,000 if anything deemed “harmful to minors” is made available to their child under another bill. The definition of “harmful to minors” includes a long and graphic list of behaviors as well as anything that might have the effect of “substantially arousing"" desires in people under 18. It includes a carve-out for things that have serious artistic, scientific, political or literary value for youth, but allows that determination to be made by “prevailing standards in the adult community.” 

            Many of the bills mirror language that was used in the so-called “Don't Say Gay” legislation proposed in more than a dozen states last year, seeking to prohibit schools from using curriculum, books or discussions that involve gender identity or sexual orientation.BOISE, Idaho (AP) — A bill criminalizing gender-affirming healthcare for minors overwhelmingly passed the Idaho House Thursday, despite warnings from opponents who said it would likely increase suicide rates among teens.The bill, which would subject physicians to felony charges if they provide puberty blockers, hormone treatment or gender-affirming surgeries to transgender youth under 18, is just one of several targeting Idaho's LGBTQ+ residents this year. Proponents of the bill have acknowledged that gender-affirming surgeries on minors are not currently being performed in Idaho.Rep. Bruce Skaug, a Republican from Nampa, said the legislation was needed to “protect children,” and that puberty blockers and hormone treatment could cause permanent harm. But every major medical organization, including the American Medical Association, American Academy of Pediatrics and American Psychiatric Association support gender-affirming care for youth. Many of those organizations have also issued policy statements opposing legislative attempts to limit such care.Republican lawmakers in more than two dozen states have pushed for bans on gender-affirming care this year, targeting what doctors and psychologists widely consider medically necessary care.The bill in Idaho passed on a near party-line vote, with only one Republican voting no.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810609,Taiwan legislators visit Dutch House of Representatives,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A delegation of Taiwan legislators visited the Netherlands House of Representatives on Tuesday (Feb. 14), a sign of strengthening diplomacy between the two countries.In December, Dutch representatives passed two pro-Taiwan resolutions. The first implored the Dutch government to use all possible means to enhance ties between Taiwan and the Netherlands. The second extended support for Taiwan by all possible diplomatic means.An invitation by Dutch parliamentarians reflects concerns about China's growing power in Asia and its rising hostilities directed at Taiwan. For this reason, three DPP legislators, Chiu Chih-wei (邱志偉), Hsu Chih-chieh (許智傑) and Tsai Shih-ying (蔡適應) were led by Taiwan’s Representative to the Netherlands Chen Hsin-hsin (陳欣新) for an in-person visit, per CNA.The Taiwan delegation were greeted by seven parliamentarians along with Dutch House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Rudmer Heerema. This was the first time Taiwan legislators entered the halls of the Dutch parliament.During the visit, Dutch parliamentarians expressed a high degree of concern about Chinese leader Xi Jinping's (習近平) regime and the possible impact upon Taiwan. Other matters were also discussed, such as Taiwan's defense capabilities, and semiconductor cooperation between Taiwan, the Netherlands, and Europe.Chiu, who headed the delegation of Taiwanese legislators, delivered a brief speech thanking the Dutch parliament for passing six resolutions supporting Taiwan since 2019. Chiu hoped for deepening cooperation in national security and science and technology. He also extended an offer to host this group should they want to personally experience Taiwan's freedom and democracy, per CNA.Both sides emphasized the importance of peace across the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan was also encouraged to improve its self-defense capabilities. Taiwan legislators responded by noting a number of budget increases bolstering military and defensive capabilities, preventing China from misjudging defensive capabilities.The invitation made to Taiwan legislators by the Dutch House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee occurred only after special discussion. Under normal circumstances, the parliamentary body would not have time to meet with foreign delegations as it would be focused on deciding its upcoming legislative agenda.Since 2019, the Dutch House of Representatives of the Netherlands passed numerous motions to support Taiwan’s international participation in the World Health Organization (WHO), Interpol, and International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).",2023/02/15,450,Politics

(AP) — A former suburban Indianapolis daycare director is facing multiple charges after being accused of giving melatonin gummies to children without their parents’ consent to get them to sleep.

            Tonya Rachelle Voris, 52, of Fortville faces 11 counts of neglect of a dependent and six counts of reckless supervision by a child care provider. 

            Voris formerly operated the Kidz Life Childcare Ministry at New Life Church in Cumberland, court records say.











            Pastor David Faulk told Cumberland police he learned Voris and another employee gave 17 kids, ages 1 to 4, melatonin gummies without their parents’ consent from mid-December through the end of January, court documents said.

            Faulk told police he fired Voris after she admitted to giving melatonin gummies to some of the kids. Faulk said the other worker was still employed at the daycare.

            Several parents told police their children had problems including trouble sleeping and developing a rash.

            Jail records show Voris was booked into the Hancock County Jail on Monday and released on bond.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810625,Mintz helps Syracuse beat No. 23 NC State 75-72,"SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) — Judah Mintz scored 20 points and Syracuse knocked off No. 23 North Carolina State 75-72 on Tuesday night.

            “I think I’m getting better as the season goes on,” Mintz said. “Just knowing when to force it up and when to get my teammates involved. I know I can score, my teammates know I can score, but just making plays for others, it’s going to make us better.”

            With the score tied at 70 with two minutes to go, Jesse Edwards finished strong at the rim, plus the foul, to give the Orange a three-point lead. Syracuse would then use a mixture of defensive pressure and clutch free-throw shooting to hold on for the victory. 











            Edwards finished with 18 points for Syracuse (16-10, 9-6 Atlantic Coast Conference), which also got 11 from Chris Bell, 10 from Malik Brown and 14 from Joseph Girard III. 

            Mintz shot 50% from 3 and made all five of his free throws. He also had a team-best nine assists. 

            “He made some great plays, he had six assists at halftime, but he was looking to get to the basket too,” Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim said. “He’s gotten better from day one. It’s a learning experience. It takes time. He’s good as any freshman around.” 

            D.J. Burns Jr. and Jarkel Joiner each scored 15 points for the Wolfpack (20-7, 10-6 ACC), who were coming off a 92-62 victory at Boston College on Saturday. 

            NC State’s backcourt of Terquavion Smith and Joiner entered Tuesday’s game as the highest-scoring duo in the ACC. Together they were averaging 34.7 points per game. Smith, who scored his 1,000th-career point against Boston College, finished Tuesday’s game with 14 points.

            “We fought, man,” NC State coach Kevin Keatts said. “It was a great ACC game on the road. Back-and-forth. Two teams just fighting in February. I felt good about our guys. We got down, we made a hell of a comeback. I thought my guys played good enough to win the game. We just came up short.”

            Syracuse’s advantage came at the charity stripe. They were 16-for-17, while the Wolfpack shot just 3-for-5. NC State was called for 19 fouls, while only 11 were called against the Orange. 

            “I’m one of those guys, that believe that the game should be won on the floor by the players,” Keatts said. “It was tough for me because at the end of the game I thought we had five calls that went completely against us, not to take away from Syracuse.”

            STAT OF THE NIGHT

            Edwards, Syracuse’s 6-foot-11 center, was perfect from 3 after making his first career triple with the shot clock winding down early in the second half. It was his first attempt in four seasons with the Orange.

            “I just thought I saw one second on the clock,” Edwards said. “I just threw it up, and then the crowd went crazy for that. You never know when a prayer’s going to go in, but it felt great.”

            BIG PICTURE

            NC State: The Wolfpack entered Tuesday’s game as winners of five of their last six. Their only loss during that stretch was to No. 8 Virginia on Feb. 7. NC State, which was picked to finish 10th in the conference preseason poll, currently holds the No. 5 spot, just two games in the win column behind ACC leaders Virginia and Pittsburgh. 

            Syracuse: The Wolfpack are the first ranked opponent in five tries the Orange have beaten this season.

(AP) — Jalen Pickett scored a season-high 41 points, the first Penn State player with 40-plus points since 1961, and the Nittany Lions beat Illinois 93-81 on Tuesday night to end a four-game losing streak. 

            It was the most points scored by a Penn State player in Big Ten play and the sixth 40-point game in program history.

            Pickett was 10-of-12 shooting with four 3-pointers in the first half, including reaching 2,000 career points on a 3 with 2:54 left. He finished 15 of 20 overall with five 3-pointers and had eight assists. He scored 46 points with Siena in a triple-overtime game against Quinnipiac on Feb. 17, 2019. 











            Seth Lundy had 11 points in the first half, hitting 4 of 5 shots with three 3s and finished with 15 points for Penn State (15-11, 6-9 Big Ten), which shot 58% overall and was 12 of 28 from distance. Kanye Clary added 12 points and Kanye Clary had 10.

            Penn State shot 62.5% (20 of 32) from the floor and hit 10 of 18 from long range in the first half for a 53-40 lead. Illinois cut the deficit to 54-47 with 18:01 left but didn’t get closer. 

            Terrence Shannon Jr. scored 20 points to lead five in double figures for Illinois (17-8, 8-6), which lost the season series with Penn State.

            Illinois plays at No. 14 Indiana on Saturday while Penn State travels to Minnesota.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810643,"Burns scores, Hurricanes beat Ovechkin-less Capitals 3-2","WASHINGTON (AP) — Brent Burns scored his 11th goal of the season, Frederik Andersen made 34 saves and the Carolina Hurricanes beat the depleted Washington Capitals 3-2 on Tuesday night.

            Burns had one of three Hurricanes goals scored thanks to a point shot from a defenseman. The 2017 Norris Trophy winner scored through traffic, Calvin de Haan's shot went in off Paul Stastny, and Brady Skjei's shot was redirected in by Stefan Noesen on the power play.

            Those hard-earned goals and Andersen's solid performance helped Carolina get back on track after losing 6-2 at home to the New York Rangers over the weekend. The Hurricanes have won 10 of their past 12 to pad their lead atop the Metropolitan Division.











            “Any time you lose, I think we’ve done a good job just kind of turning the page,"" Stastny said. “For us, it’s just kind of finding our legs, finding our groove after that break. I think we were playing pretty well going into the break and now we’re just slowly finding it more and more the past couple games, and I think we’ll be able to get back to where we were before.”

            This was the kind of response the Hurricanes were hoping for after losing to New York on Saturday and with players' fathers and mentors in attendance. It's a good start to the week for the Hurricanes, who are set to play their first outdoor game Saturday night against Washington at North Carolina State's football stadium in Raleigh.

            “It’s just good to get a win,” Stastny said. “The fathers' trip is always kind of special for everyone. You always play with a little extra energy.”

            The Capitals could get top winger Tom Wilson back for the Stadium Series game, but they'll still be without captain Alex Ovechkin, No. 1 defenseman John Carlson and likely fourth-line center Nic Dowd.

            
                Ovechkin left the team Tuesday to attend to a family health matter, and coach Peter Laviolette expects the Russian winger to be out at least the rest of the week and away “for the foreseeable future.” Carlson has been out since Dec. 23 after taking a slapshot to the head, while Dowd has missed 10 consecutive games because of injury.

            “I thought we played hard against a real good team,” Laviolette said. “I didn’t like the outcome. We didn’t win the hockey game. Did a lot of good things, but in the end we came up short.”

            Joe Snively, only in the lineup because of the absences of Ovechkin and forward Aliaksei Protas — who's out to be with his wife for the birth of the couple's first child — had a goal and a primary assist. The Northern Virginia native set up T.J. Oshie with a perfect pass in front and later picked a corner on Andersen to score his first goal since Feb. 17, 2022.

            Darcy Kuemper made 27 saves and could hardly be blamed on any of Carolina's goals. Trevor van Riemsdyk's would-be tying goal for the Capitals midway through the third period was disallowed after Carolina coach Rod Brind'Amour successfully challenged for goaltender interference.

            The NHL’s Situation Room said video review determined Oshie impaired Andersen’s ability to play his position.

            “Nobody's sure on these,” Brind'Amour said. “On the overhead, it’s clear (Oshie) goes in by himself and he takes a crack at the puck but then he lies on the goalie for a split second. So, by the letter of the law, you’re not allowed to do that, so that’s why I was pretty sure.”

            Washington has lost two in a row since beating the league-leading Boston Bruins on Saturday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810646,Duke edges Notre Dame with Coach K in the house 68-64,"DURHAM, N.C. (AP) — Kyle Filipowski scored 22 points and Duke beat Notre Dame 68-64 on Tuesday night with former coach Mike Krzyzewski on hand to watch the man who succeeded him pick up a milestone victory.

            Krzyzewski, accompanied by wife Mickie, attended his first game at “Coach K Court” inside Cameron Indoor Stadium since retiring after last season to conclude a 42-year career as the Blue Devils coach. He saw Jon Scheyer become the first men’s ACC coach to win his first 13 career home games, passing North Carolina’s Hubert Davis, who had 12 to start the 2021-22 season.

            Filipowski was scoreless in an overtime loss at Virginia on Saturday in which the ACC admitted officials should have let a foul call stand on his last-second drive in regulation and given him two potential game-winning free throws. In Tuesday's win he was 9-of 16 shooting and the only Blue Devil to score in double figures.











            Notre Dame's Dane Goodwin scored 19 of his 25 points in the second half, including 17 straight. He was 11-of-13 shooting. Ven-Allen Lubin added 10 points. Nate Laszewski, who had a career-high 33 points in his last game, a loss to Virginia Tech, scored just five and fouled out, though he went over 1,500 career points.

            Duke (18-8, 9-6) led by eight at halftime and 14 five minutes into the second half before the Fighting Irish rallied. 

            Consecutive 3-pointers by Cormac Ryan and JJ Starling cut Duke's lead to two and Starling's drive made it a one-point game with 36 seconds left. But Mark Mitchell followed with a baseline 3-pointer with 10.8 remaining before Lubin's tip-in cut the lead to two. Tyrese Proctor's two free throws finished the scoring. 

            Duke took a 31-23 halftime lead behind Filipowski's 10 points and Dariq Whitehead's nine on three 3-pointers. Notre Dame (10-16, 2-13) led by two midway through the half but then went 1 of 10 over a seven-minute stretch.

            Notre Dame is at sixth-ranked Virginia and Duke plays at Syracuse in games Saturday.

            In what Auburn coach Bruce Pearl called “a must-win for us,” before the game, his Tigers led by 17 after seven minutes, 27 at halftime and 37 less than seven minutes into the second half in handing the visiting Tigers their worst loss of the season.

            The teams entered the game tied for fourth in the Southeastern Conference, but Auburn had lost three-straight while Missouri was coming off a win at No. 6 Tennessee.

            This one was decided early. Flanigan opened the scoring with a 3-pointer and when Johnson drilled a 3 less than seven minutes in to cap a 14-0 run it was 19-2. Flanigan's dunk made it 30-6 nine minutes before halftime.

Rejoining the party in time to qualify for an upcoming primary will be difficult as party rules dictate a minimum waiting period of four years, with Guo needing to wait till September.According to a UDN report, Gou has reached out to KMT Chairman Eric Chu (朱立倫) to discuss the matter. Former KMT Secretary-General Lee Chien-lung (李乾龍) said party rules need to be followed when evaluating Gou’s potential return to the KMT, and consequent participation in party primaries.To deal with his predicament, Gou was spotted traveling to the offices of former Legislative President Wang Jin-pyng (王金平) on Tuesday (Feb. 14). The two met in private for approximately one hour, with Gou potentially strategizing a quick return to the KMT for the purpose of participating in the party’s primary.As it stands now, Gou’s application to return to the party would be too late to qualify for participation in the KMT primaries for the 2024 presidential election. However, there is a chance the KMT Party Central Committee could formulate special measures to relax regulations restoring party membership or relevant nomination regulations.New Taipei City Mayor Hou You-yi (侯友宜) is the presumed frontrunner in the party’s primary, though he has yet to announce his candidacy for the presidency. Hou has also benefitted from the support of KMT Chairman Eric Chu, who has repeatedly praised him as one of the strongest and dependable members of the KMT.As for whether Gou will be able to wiggle himself back into the party through the back door, this is a matter that still requires observation. Fielding a competitive primary and choosing the most qualified individual may be in the interest of the party, though there may be other factors at play.Party watchers say the KMT is currently focused on a by-election for Nantou legislators on March 4, and only later will the KMT make an announcement about how it will hold its primary election.",2023/02/15,975,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810679,Canadiens crush Blackhawks 4-0 for third straight win,"MONTREAL (AP) — The Montreal Canadiens scored three goals in the third period to earn a 4-0 win over Western Conference bottom-dwellers Chicago Blackhawks on Tuesday.

            Joel Armia scored one goal and added an assist, while Jonathan Drouin collected three assists. Justin Barron, David Savard and Christian Dvorak also scored as the Canadiens won a third straight game since returning from the NHL All-Star break.

            “It wasn’t a pretty one for us, but we found a way to win,” Dvorak said. “We had a really good third period which was nice but now we really want to finish off this homestand the right way and go on the road on a little win streak here.”











            Jake Allen made 22 saves to bank his first shutout of the season.

            “It can sometimes be a bit of a letdown game when you have two really big wins, then a day off and then come back to that third one,” Allen said. “Sometimes it can be tough to get back up after such an emotional couple of wins so I’m just glad we did.”

            Jaxson Stauber made 27 saves as Chicago started a four-game Canadian road trip with back-to-back losses. After three straight wins to start his NHL career, the Canadiens handed the 23-year-old native of Wayzata, Minnesota, his first loss.

            “We were real sloppy in the first period,” said Blackhawks coach Luke Richardson. “We just didn’t play a good, solid game and I think they found their game before us and then it became tough.

            “I mentioned a few times this year, when we play well we’re really connected together and today we just seem disconnected.”

            The Canadiens drew first blood on the power play at 8:38 of the opening period. Barron’s wrist shot from the point deflected off Chicago defenseman Jack Johnson and past Stauber.

            Chicago was inches away from tying the game when Andreas Athanasiou freed himself on a breakaway. Allen saved Athanasiou’s shot but the forward’s skate pushed the puck toward the goal line. The Habs goaltender knocked the net loose with his skate before the puck crossed the line.

            Drouin connected with Armia on a cross-ice pass giving Montreal a two-goal lead at 5:45 of the final period. Stauber was shaken up after a collision on the play but remained in the game.

            The Canadiens sealed the win midway through the third period with two goals in less than a minute.

            SPECIAL GUESTS

            Ukraine Team Select, a hockey team consisting of 11- and 12-year-old refugees displaced by war in their home country, attended the game. The Ukrainian players sat on the Canadiens bench to take in the pre-game warmups and received fist bumps and pucks from players as they prepared for the game.

            The Canadiens presented a welcome video in the first period highlighting their path in the Quebec Peewee Tournament. The team received an ovation from the Bell Center crowd.

            INJURY REPORT

            Blackhawks defenseman Jarred Tinordi left for the locker room at 5:40 of the first period. The Blackhawks announced during the second period that he would not return to the game.

            Before the game, the Montreal Canadiens announced that defenseman Arber Xhekaj would be out indefinitely with an upper-body injury. The undrafted rookie suffered the injury during a fight with Edmonton Oilers blue liner Vincent Desharnais during Montreal’s 6-2 win over the Oilers last Sunday.

            “Normally, I wouldn’t be there,” Graves said. “I was driving the net and I saw it pop through a hole. It was a great play by (McCleod).”

            Yegor Sharangovich and Jesper Bratt had the other goals for the Devils, and Graves also had an assist. Vitek Vanecek stopped 31 shots for New Jersey, which remains three points behind first-place Carolina and moved five ahead of the New York Rangers in the Metropolitan Division.











            “I think the one thing we’ve done well is we’ve stayed in games when games have been tight,” Devils coach Lindy Ruff said. “To win the game where Mike McLeod comes off the bench, makes a great play, and Graves joins the play, just the awareness to know the clock is ticking down. Heck of a play by Michael.”

            Adam Boqvist had a goal and an assist, and Johnny Gaudreau scored for Columbus, which has lost five of six, including three straight at home, and continues to sit last in the NHL. Elvis Merzlikins stopped 29 shots.

            The teams traded goals through the first two periods, scoring late and early.

            Sharangovich made it 1-0 at 10:46 of the first and Gaudreau tied it on a power-play goal with 1.3 second left in the period.

            Bratt’s go-ahead goal came 7 seconds into the second period before Boqvist tied it again at 4:41 with his first goal of the season.

            “I thought we played excellent,” Blue Jackets coach Brad Larsen said. “The third period got a little away from us as far turnovers, the puck management a bit. We had three chances in the third period up until they scored the goal. Against that team, what they can create and been doing it all year, that was a heck of an effort.”

            ROAD WARRIORS

            The Devils own the best road record in the NHL at 20-3-3. The franchise record for road wins in a season is 28 (28-10-3) in 1998-99.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810683,"Poeltl scores 30, Siakam has 26, Raptors beat Magic 123-113","TORONTO (AP) — Jakob Poeltl scored 30 points, Pascal Siakam had 26 and the Toronto Raptors beat the Orlando Magic 123-113 on Tuesday night for their fifth win in six games.

            Scottie Barnes scored 17 points, Fred VanVleet had 10 points and a season-high 15 assists, and Precious Achiuwa had 11 points and 13 rebounds for the Raptors, who shot a season-best 60.2%.

            Wendell Carter Jr. scored 26 points, Jalen Suggs had 24 off the bench and Markelle Fultz scored 19 points for the Magic.











            Orlando came in having won three straight road games but couldn’t follow Monday’s win at Chicago with another victory. The Magic are 1-10 in the second game of back-to-backs.

            A former Raptor who was reacquired from San Antonio last week, Poeltl shot 15 for 17 and added nine rebounds and six blocks.

            “You see what he did tonight,” Magic coach Jamahl Mosely said. “He was a game changer.”

            The 30 points were the most Poeltl has scored as a Raptors player. His career high is 31, set with San Antonio last Nov. 15 at Portland.

            “It’s just about reacting to the defense,” Poeltl said. “They decided to trap Freddie a bunch of times. I’m comfortable catching the ball there at the top of the key and trying to make plays.”

            Suggs said Poeltl hurt Orlando with his bruising, physical style.

            “He’s a force in the paint,” Suggs said. “Trying to box him out, you can’t out-jump him. He’s really strong and physical in there. He fits what they want to do. He’s a physical big who’s going to hit you in your mouth and have no remorse about it.”

            One game after setting a season best by allowing just five points off turnovers, the Raptors made a season-worst 20 miscues against the Magic, leading to 26 points. The Magic weren’t much better, making 19 turnovers that led to 29 points for Toronto.

            “You can’t turn the basketball over and give up offensive rebounds and give yourself a chance,” Mosley said.

            The Raptors outrebounded the Magic 40-29 and had a 13-9 edge on the offensive glass.

            As the All Star break arrives, Orlando has gone 19-15 since a 5-20 start.

            “I feel like we did a solid job from the beginning of the year to now of kind of changing the script of who the Orlando Magic are,” Carter said.

            Orlando led 70-65 at halftime but Poeltl scored eight points in the third as Toronto took a 94-89 edge to the fourth.

            TIP-INS

            Magic: Paolo Banchero scored 13 points. … F Jonathan Isaac (left knee) sat as Orlando played the second game of a back-to-back. … G Cole Anthony (sore right wrist) missed his second straight game.

G Gary Trent Jr. (sore left calf) missed his second game while F O.G.

            Barnes reached 2,000 career points. At 21 years and 197 days, he’s the third-youngest player in Raptors history to reach the milestone, behind Tracy McGrady and Chris Bosh.

            ROAD WORK AHEAD

            After hosting the Pelicans in their first game following the All-Star break, Toronto plays seven of eight on the road, a testing stretch that includes games at Cleveland, Denver, and both Los Angeles teams.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810684,Carter leads No. 24 Providence past No. 18 Creighton in 2 OT,"PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — Devin Carter had a career-high 25 points and No. 24 Providence outlasted No. 18 Creighton 94-86 in double overtime Tuesday night.

            Bryce Hopkins and Noah Locke each scored 20 for the Friars (19-7, 11-4 Big East), who ended an eight-game winning streak for the Bluejays that began with a Jan. 14 victory over Providence at home.

            “It was a great college basketball game if you didn’t care who won. It had to be a lot of fun to watch,” Creighton coach Greg McDermott said. 











            With the victory, the Friars tied the Bluejays (17-9, 11-4) for third place in the Big East standings. Both teams are a half-game behind Xavier and a game back of first-place Marquette in a crowded race for the regular-season title.

            Providence, the defending regular-season champion, improved to 14-0 at home this season and 9-1 in its past 10 games that went to overtime — including a pair of double-OT wins on its own court this season.

            Ryan Nembhard led Creighton with 21 points and 10 rebounds. Arthur Kaluma and Trey Alexander both scored 17.

            The game featured 20 lead changes and 17 ties. Providence finally pulled away in the second overtime, scoring the first five points and holding Creighton to just two late free throws after the Friars built a 92-84 lead.

            “Obviously, we weren’t as efficient in the second overtime as we were in the first,” McDermott said. “Defensively, we haven’t had a team do that to us in a long time.”

            Carter also had eight rebounds and two blocks. The sophomore guard helped the Friars get off on the right foot in the second OT, converting a three-point play to snap an 84-all deadlock. 

            Carter's father had a front-row seat for his son's best game of the season. Anthony Carter is an assistant coach for the Miami Heat who played 13 years in the NBA.

            “Devin affects the game in a number of different ways,” Providence coach Ed Cooley said. “You hear about all these different players around the country defensively. I wouldn’t take one player in America defensively — not one. We put him on everyone. We may put him on Julius Erving if he comes out of retirement. This man here is a stud defensively.” 

            END OF REGULATION

            The Friars tied it at 73 with a minute remaining in the second half, and both teams had a chance to win in regulation. Hopkins missed a step-back jumper on the baseline with 14 seconds left, and Creighton’s last bid nearly resulted in a turnover near midcourt. 

            END OF FIRST OT

            Providence opened an 82-78 lead after Hopkins made a 3-pointer, but Creighton tied it 84-all after Baylor Scheierman hit two free throws with 48.4 seconds left. 

            A sloppy possession resulted in PC committing a shot clock violation with 9.5 seconds to go. Creighton turned to Nembhard on the ensuing possession but Carter came up huge once again when he blocked Nembhard's shot down low to extend the game another five minutes. 

            “I knew he was going to pump fake so I stayed down,"" Carter said. “Obviously, he has to shoot it with two seconds left. I jumped up and ended up blocking it.”

            BIG MINUTES

            Hopkins played all 50 minutes. Ed Croswell was one of three Friars to log 45 or more as the senior big man chipped in with 15 points on 7-of-11 shooting while holding his ground against Creighton center Ryan Kalkbrenner.

            POLL IMPLICATIONS

            Creighton: The Bluejays are ranked for the second consecutive week after spending nine straight weeks outside the AP Top 25. Creighton was No. 9 in the preseason poll.

            Nebraska (13-14, 6-10 Big Ten) won its first game at Rutgers since Jan. 24, 2018. The Cornhuskers also have their first two-game winning streak in conference play this season.

            Nebraska led throughout the second half — with its advantage not dropping below seven points in the final 10 minutes. Cam Spencer made a 3-pointer from the corner to pull Rutgers within 78-70, but the Cornhuskers made two free throws with 43.7 seconds left and again with 33 remaining to secure it.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810686,"With Ovechkin out, Hurricanes defeat Capitals 3-2","WASHINGTON (AP) — Brent Burns scored his 11th goal of the season, Frederik Andersen made 34 saves and the Carolina Hurricanes beat the depleted Washington Capitals 3-2 on Tuesday night.

            Burns had one of three Hurricanes goals scored thanks to a point shot from a defenseman. The 2017 Norris Trophy winner scored through traffic, Calvin de Haan’s shot went in off Paul Stastny, and Brady Skjei’s shot was redirected in by Stefan Noesen on the power play.

            The Hurricanes have won 10 of their past 12 to pad their lead atop the Metropolitan Division.











            Joe Snively, only in the lineup because of the absences of Ovechkin and forward Aliaksei Protas — who’s out to be with his wife for the birth of the couple’s first child — had a goal and a primary assist. The Northern Virginia native set up T.J. Oshie with a perfect pass in front and later picked a corner on Andersen to score his first goal since Feb. 17, 2022.

            BRUINS 3, STARS 2, OT

            DALLAS (AP) — David Pastrnak scored with 1:16 remaining in overtime, and Boston rallied over Dallas in a matchup of the top team in each conference.

            Taylor Hall opened the scoring for Boston, and Pavel Zacha scored the tying goal in the third period for the NHL-leading Bruins. It was Jim Montgomery’s first game as a head coach in Dallas since the Stars fired him in 2019 for what he later admitted was a drinking problem. Linus Ullmark stopped 29.

            Roope Hintz and Jason Robertson scored for the Stars. Joe Pavelski had two assists for Dallas and Jake Oettinger made 34 saves.

            Pastrnak, who assisted on Zacha’s tying goal, scored his team-leading 39th with the teams playing 4-on-4 in overtime because play never stopped after Brad Marchand’s interference penalty ended 2 1/2 minutes into the extra period.

            COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Ryan Graves scored off a feed from Michael McLeod in front of the net with 1.4 seconds left, and New Jersey beat Columbus for its fourth win in five games.

            Yegor Sharangovich and Jesper Bratt had the other goals for the Devils, and Graves also had an assist. Vitek Vanecek stopped 31 shots for New Jersey, which remains three points behind first-place Carolina and moved five ahead of the New York Rangers in the Metropolitan Division. 

            Adam Boqvist had a goal and an assist, and Johnny Gaudreau scored for Columbus, which has lost five of six, including three straight at home, and continues to sit last in the NHL. Elvis Merzlikins stopped 29 shots.

            LIGHTNING 4, AVALANCHE 3, SO

            DENVER (AP) — Steven Stamkos scored in the shootout and Tampa Bay rallied from a two-goal deficit to beat a banged-up Colorado team.

            The first to go, Stamkos sent a shot past Alexandar Georgiev to set the tone for the shootout. Andrei Vasilevskiy took it from there.

            Nikita Kucherov, Anthony Cirelli and Vladislav Namestnikov had goals for a Tampa Bay team that trailed 2-0 midway through the second period. Vasilevskiy finished with 43 saves.

            Artturi Lehkonen, Nathan MacKinnon and Denis Malgin had goals for the Avalanche. It was Malgin’s first goal in a Colorado uniform after being acquired in a deal with Toronto on Dec. 19. Georgiev stopped 32 shots. 

            JETS 3, KRAKEN 2, SO

            WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) — Mark Scheifele and Pierre-Luc Dubois scored in the shootout to give Winnipeg a come-from-behind victory.

            The Jets were the only NHL team that hadn’t played in the shot contest. They’re now 8-1 past regulation.

            Blake Wheeler and Dubois scored for the Jets, who have won three in a row. David Rittich made 27 saves. 

            John Hayden and Jared McCann scored for the Kraken, who ended a five-game road trip going 1-3-1. Philipp Grubauer stopped 38 shots.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810688,Taiwan to develop own ChatGPT-like chatbot to counter China's version,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The Taiwan government said this week that it would launch its own AI-powered chatbot as an alternative to counter China's ChatYuan, which pushes Beijing's state-approved narrative.Taiwan's version of an artificial intelligence (AI) powered ChatGPT-like chatbot is scheduled for launch by the end of 2023, said Wu Tsung-tsong (吳政忠), head of the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC), in a media briefing on Monday (Feb. 13). The chatbot will be designed to serve Mandarin speakers using traditional characters.Taiwan began discussing developing its own chatbot in November, when San Francisco–based OpenAI released ChatGPT. An anonymous official said meetings with experts have discussed how to integrate advanced technologies in fields like big data, machine learning, and AI algorithms to give the chatbot a better feel for traditional Chinese characters.In a report issued in late December, Taiwan ranked No. 7 in the world in terms of AI technologies and solutions.However, relevant technologies advancement does not mean it will be easy to develop a chatbot, said several AI experts. Dr. Hsieh Chen-chiung (謝禎冏), director of Tatung University's AI Lab, said, for example, massive data licensing needed for development would be a big challenge.Dr. Lee Hung-yi (李宏毅), electrical engineering professor at National Taiwan University, said strong machine learning has to be complimented by powerful hardware. He pointed out that Microsoft ChatGPT was built with 10,000 GPUs, but the likely developer, the National Center for High-Performance Computing (NARLabs) only has around a fifth of those.Lee added that Taiwan's chatbot can be more appealing to Mandarin speakers around the world by modeling it using solid AI research from Taiwan's top universities, in addition to the principles of freedom of speech and democracy.",2023/02/15,1295,Business
