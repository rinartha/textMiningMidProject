https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796715,Southern Taiwan rice fields go fallow due to lack of rain,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The Chiayi-Tainan Plain, one of Taiwan’s most important areas for rice cultivation, will mostly go unplanted this spring due to a lack of rainfall and low reservoir levels.According to the Council of Agriculture (COA), some 19,000 hectares in this area will be left fallow. The decision was made by the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) on Dec. 9, 2022, when it announced a suspension of water irrigation rights for the first rice planting in the Chiayi-Tainan Plain.Rainfall in the second half of 2022 in the Chiayi-Tainan Plain area was only 40% of that compared to previous years. Furthermore, the main supplier of water to the area, the Tsengwen Reservoir, currently stands at 23.45% capacity, according to the Water Resources Agency.Farmers relying upon their own wells can continue to plant, but higher costs make such an undertaking prohibitive and only viable for organic and specialized rice planting.At a recent coordination meeting between government officials and farmers, most farmers agreed to let their fields remain fallow in exchange for government subsidies. Those planting high-quality rice qualify for a maximum subsidy of NT$96,000 (US$3,200) per hectare, while the maximum assistance for mechanized farming is NT$200,000 (US$6,600), per a News and Market report.Farmers at the meeting noted the talks were not bilateral, as it was only an instrument of the government to express unilateral policy. They also felt little recourse but to accept the fact that industrial water use took precedence over agricultural water use, with no discussion of increased water consumption by the Southern Taiwan Science Park.Area farmers and nurseries are once again feeling helpless when it comes to the suspension of irrigation. The Tainan area has experienced water shortages and cut-off irrigation beginning in 2021 with crop rotation encouraged in 2022, and once again no water at the start of 2023. Three consecutive years of uncertain water supply has angered farmers who note the ""Water Act"" stipulates that agricultural water supply cannot be sacrificed for industrial water supply.Furthermore, many young farmers who have been encouraged to return to their hometowns to take over family farms and ensure the nation’s food supply now feel cheated by an irrigation policy which is depriving them of the right to work, according to News and Market. They note that farming is not just relying on government subsidies.",2023/02/01,1191,Environment

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796722,French Quarter Festival unveils lineup for 40th anniversary,"NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Organizers on Tuesday announced a lineup of more than 270 acts for New Orleans' 40th annual French Quarter Festival, billed as Louisiana's largest free showcase of music, food and culture. 

            Artists scheduled to perform at the April 13-16 event include Irma Thomas, Ani DiFranco, Tank and the Bangas, blues guitarist Samantha Fish and a collaboration between the Soul Rebels and bounce rap artist Big Freedia, organizers said. 

            The event launches three weeks of musical festivities in the city, with the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival taking place the last weekend of April and first weekend of May.











            What began decades ago as an open call for local musicians to perform on six stages on Royal and Bourbon Streets has expanded into an event with 20 stages that welcomes over 825,000 people and is a critical economic driver for the city, French Quarter Festival organizers said. 

            To celebrate this milestone year, organizers are planning a special opening-day parade featuring brass bands and later a fireworks display over the Mississippi River. 

            Emily Madero, president & CEO of French Quarter Festivals Inc., said the company “is proud to say we have stayed committed to our mission for four decades, providing a platform for local artists, chefs, and restaurants to showcase their talents.”

            Mayor LaToya Cantrell said she looks forward “to celebrating our wonderful traditions, rich heritage and unique culture that resonate with people across the globe.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796724,BC beats No. 20 Clemson 62-54; Tigers' lead sliced atop ACC,"BOSTON (AP) — Clemson wasn't able to escape on the road this time.

            Makai Ashton-Langford had two key driving baskets in the closing two minutes and finished with 15 points to help Boston College beat the 20th-ranked Tigers 62-54 on Tuesday night. 

            “I couldn’t get my guys under control. I couldn’t get them to relax. That’s my fault,” Clemson coach Brad Brownell said. “For whatever reason, we just didn't do a good job tonight. I didn't do a good job as a coach.”











            On Saturday, Clemson escaped with an 82-81 victory at Florida State.

            Jaeden Zackery added 13 points for the Eagles (11-12, 5-7 Atlantic Coast Conference). BC held Clemson to one meaningful field goal — and that came with 18 seconds left — in the final 13:16.

            Hunter Tyson led Clemson (18-5, 10-2) with 22 points and Chase Hunter had 12. The Tigers fell into a tie in the loss column atop the ACC with No. 6 Virginia (9-2 ACC).

            “It was one of those nights where the other team played better than we did,” Brownell said. “We had a lot of self-inflicted wounds. We didn’t share the ball much. When we got behind, we kind of panicked and hoped Chase and Hunter would bail us out. That's poor coaching.” 

            The Eagles used a 5-0 spurt — with T.J. Bickerstaff hitting a free throw and getting a driving layup — to pull ahead 50-45 with just over five minutes to play.

            Clemson sliced it to 50-47 before Aston-Langford made his two big baskets. He followed that by making two free throws with 32 seconds left.

            “That's just about digging deep honestly,” Zackery said. “That's just all it was. We’ve been kind of talking about it all season that we’ve just got to come out and grind.” 

            Trailing by 10 midway into the second half, the Tigers went on a 10-0 spree, tying it at 45 when RJ Godfrey hit both ends of a 1-and-1.

            The Eagles had opened a double-digit lead twice in the opening six minutes of the second half, the later 45-35 on Prince Aligbe’s foul-line jumper with 14:12 to play.

            BIG PICTURE

            Clemson: Off to a solid start in conference play, the Tigers were tested on the road for the second straight game after edging Florida State. It hasn’t been easy for them away from home with a 4-3 record and with three away matchups against North Carolina, North Carolina State and Virginia to go, they’ll need to get it straightened out of they’re going to win the ACC regular-season title.

            Boston College: The Eagles proved when they play defense that they’re a tough out in coach Earl Grant’s second season. A little more offense could make them very dangerous for top ACC teams to play. 

            “I just tell the guys that we’re just trying to build something,” Grant said of his team's defense down the stretch. “You are what you repeatedly do. You build habits.” 

            ARRIVING LATE

            In the first half, Clemson’s man-to-man defense smothered the Eagles’ offense for the opening 10 minutes, holding them in single digits in scoring until just about the same time the student section finished filling up late, bringing some energy to a very quiet building.

            BC’s players then responded, closing the half with a 22-4 spree that turned an 11-point deficit to a 30-23 halftime edge. 

            SIDELINED

            Both teams were missing key players. Guard Brevin Galloway, Clemson’s fourth leading scorer at 10.6 points per game, was sidelined with an abdominal injury. For BC, guard DeMarr Langford Jr., who logs big minutes at the point, was out with a knee injury.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796725,"Pack's late flurry lifts No. 23 Miami past Va Tech, 92-83","CORAL GABLES, Fla. (AP) — Nigel Pack had five perfect minutes, and Miami remained perfect at home because of them.

            Pack scored all 17 of his points in a six-shot barrage late in the second half that lifted the 23rd-ranked Hurricanes to a 92-83 comeback win over Virginia Tech on Tuesday night.

            “We made some good decisions,"" Miami coach Jim Larrañaga said. “We scored the ball very, very well during those last four or five minutes.""











            Norchad Omier led Miami with 21 points, while Isaiah Wong had 18 and Jordan Miller finished with 14 for the Hurricanes (17-5, 8-4 Atlantic Coast Conference).

            Hunter Cattoor and Sean Pedulla each scored 20 for Virginia Tech, while Grant Basile each added 17 and Justyn Mutts finished with 10 for the Hokies (13-9, 3-8).

            “I thought it was an outstanding college basketball game,"" Larrañaga said.

            The Hurricanes improved to 12-0 at home this season, and 5-0 in games immediately after a loss. The last time Miami lost on its home floor was Feb. 26 — to Virginia Tech, which hasn't won a true road game since.

            But for much of Tuesday night, the Hokies looked like they'd end that streak with another victory in Coral Gables. They led by five with 8:20 left, when Miami — led by Pack — hit its best stride of the night.

            Pack was scoreless for the game's first 32-1/2 minutes. But his 3-pointer with 7:35 left tied the game at 68 and started an absolute barrage from the sophomore guard from Indianapolis.

            He made six consecutive shots in a span of 5:07, five of them 3-pointers, the last of them putting Miami up 84-76 with 2:28 remaining.

            “Once you get it going, a guy like him who shoots so well, you can keep it going for a long time,"" Larrañaga said.

            It seemed to inspire Miami on the defensive end as well. Virginia Tech shot 29 for 44 — a 66% clip — over the first 35 minutes, then missed its final seven shots from there as the Hurricanes did just enough to prevail. The last shot was a dunk try by Mutts that was blocked by Omier, and Wooga Poplar finished off the win with a dunk on the other end.

            “I’m tired of watching Miami play. I admire them. They’re really good,"" Virginia Tech coach Mike Young said. “If you’re not playing with great poise and great attention to detail ... they were quite obviously better down the stretch than we were.

            BIG PICTURE

            Virginia Tech: The Hokies have now lost eight of their last 10, after an 11-1 start to the season. They’re 0-3 on the road against ranked teams. ... Virginia Tech was outscored 22-4 in fast-break points.

            Miami: Former Hurricanes football players David Njoku (Cleveland) and Braxton Berrios (New York Jets) were at the game. ... Miami shot 58% and Omier had eight rebounds for the Hurricanes.

            POLL IMPLICATIONS

            It was a needed win for Miami, which has been slipping in the AP Top 25 – and now faces ACC leader Clemson in a game that the Hurricanes may need to stay in the rankings.

But his 3-pointer with 7:35 left tied the game at 68 and started an absolute barrage from the sophomore guard from Indianapolis.He made six consecutive shots in a span of 5:07, five of them 3-pointers, the last of them putting Miami up 84-76 with 2:28 remaining.“Once you get it going, a guy like him who shoots so well, you can keep it going for a long time,"" Larrañaga said.It seemed to inspire Miami on the defensive end as well. Virginia Tech shot 29 for 44 — a 66% clip — over the first 35 minutes, then missed its final seven shots from there as the Hurricanes did just enough to prevail. The last shot was a dunk try by Mutts that was blocked by Omier, and Wooga Poplar finished off the win with a dunk on the other end.“I’m tired of watching Miami play. I admire them. They’re really good,"" Virginia Tech coach Mike Young said. “If you’re not playing with great poise and great attention to detail ... they were quite obviously better down the stretch than we were.BIG PICTUREVirginia Tech: The Hokies have now lost eight of their last 10, after an 11-1 start to the season. They’re 0-3 on the road against ranked teams. ... Virginia Tech was outscored 22-4 in fast-break points.Miami: Former Hurricanes football players David Njoku (Cleveland) and Braxton Berrios (New York Jets) were at the game. ... Miami shot 58% and Omier had eight rebounds for the Hurricanes.POLL IMPLICATIONSIt was a needed win for Miami, which has been slipping in the AP Top 25 – and now faces ACC leader Clemson in a game that the Hurricanes may need to stay in the rankings.UP NEXTVirginia Tech: Host No. 6 Virginia on Saturday.Miami: Visit No. 20 Clemson on Saturday.___AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/college-basketball and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/02/01,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796742,US says Russia violating New START nuclear treaty,"The United States on Tuesday said Russia had violated the terms of the New START Treaty, saying Moscow was not allowing inspection activities on its territory.The finding was delivered to Congress and summed up in a statement by the State Department.""Russia's refusal to facilitate inspection activities prevents the United States from exercising important rights under the treaty and threatens the viability of US-Russian nuclear arms control,"" a State Department spokesperson said.Leaders of national security committees in the Senate, which must approve treaties, said Russia's failure to adhere to the conditions of the treaty would affect future arms arrangements.""But to be very clear, compliance with New START treaty obligations will be critical to Senate consideration of any future strategic arms control treaty with Moscow,"" Democratic Senators Bob Menendez, Jack Reed and Mark Warner said in a statement.Tuesday's development follows months of US assessments that the two countries would be able to salvage cooperation on limiting strategic nuclear weapons despite high tensions relating to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.Inspections of US and Russian military sites under the treaty were halted by both countries in March 2020, owing to the onset of the COVID pandemic.The US-Russia committee — which aims to ensure the application of the terms of the treaty — last convened in October 2021.In November 2022, Russia postponed another planned round of talks, saying it was responding to US support of Ukraine and sanctions against Russia. It had cited similar reasons for not cooperating with inspections earlier in the year.The New START treaty is the last remaining pillar of post-Cold War nuclear arms control between the two nations.The pact seeks to limit the two countries to 1,550 deployed nuclear warheads and 700 deployed ballistic missiles and heavy bombers. With New START set to expire in 2026, President Joe Biden has said he is keen to negotiate an extension.Together, the United States and Russia still account for around 90% of the world's nuclear warheads. However, both have far smaller arsenals now compared to peaks late in the Cold War.jsi/msh (AP, AFP, Reuters)",2023/02/01,,

Jordan Walsh had 12 points and seven rebounds off the bench. Anthony Black pitched in with 11 points, seven assists and five boards. Makhel Mitchell totaled nine points, 13 rebounds and a season-high seven blocks — one off his career high.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796750,Jimmy Butler scores 23 as Heat hold off Cavaliers 100-97,"CLEVELAND (AP) — Jimmy Butler scored 23 points, Bam Adebayo added 18 points and 11 rebounds and the Miami Heat showed their experience down the stretch in a 100-97 win over the Cleveland Cavaliers on Tuesday night.

            Caleb Martin scored 18 points and matched his career high with 10 rebounds, and Tyler Herro also scored 18 for the Heat, who moved within 1 1/2 games of the fifth-place Cavs in the Eastern Conference standings.

            After 45 up-and-down minutes, the Heat made key plays when it mattered most.











            “When it gets to the last three of four minutes, because of the experiences we’ve had, guys feel comfortable enough to execute under that kind of pressure,” Miami coach Erik Spoelstra said.

            Cavs coach J.B. Bickerstaff said Miami's maturity was the difference.

            “That's why they are who they are,” he said.

            Butler, who has been slowed by injuries for much of the season, hit a short jumper to put the Heat up 98-93 with 1:23 left, and his free throw — following a huge offensive rebound by Adebayo — kept the Heat ahead by five with 12 seconds left.

            Darius Garland's 3-pointer brought the Cavs within 99-97 with 8.7 seconds remaining. Cleveland fouled Butler with 7.3 seconds left, and he split his free throws, giving Cleveland a chance to tie.

            All-Star starter Donovan Mitchell rushed the ball up the floor but his contested 3-pointer at the buzzer was short.

            “They know who to key in on at that point,” Bickerstaff said. “But I thought (Mitchell) did a great job of creating separation and getting a shot off. I thought we got as good a look as we can at that point.”

            Butler was most pleased by Miami's defense in the closing minutes.

            “We still had lapses, but I'm glad those lapses did not cost us the game,” he said. “We got stops down the stretch when we needed to.”

            Evan Mobley scored 19 points, Mitchell had 16 and Jarrett Allen added 14 points and 11 rebounds for the Cavs, who dropped to 21-6 at home.

            Mitchell and Darius Garland were a combined 4 of 19 on 3-pointers.

            The NBA's top-rated defensive team, the Cavs came out looking to make everything difficult for the Heat offensively.

            Miami had no early answers and started 2 of 10 from the floor with five turnovers in the first five minutes, but Butler scored 11 points in the quarter while helping his teammates settle in.

            “We were disjointed at the beginning of the game, and I think Jimmy sensed that and went to work,” Spoelstra said.

            HEAT CHECK

            Miami has been one of the league's steadiest franchises, missing the playoffs just three times since 2008. 

            It's a model Cleveland would like to follow.

            Bickerstaff admires both the Heat's consistency and ability to adapt. He credits Miami president Pat Riley and Spoelstra for leading the way.

            “They have a philosophy and are flexible enough to change with the times and keep people wanting to be a part of it,"" he said. “They have core values they believe in and then they do a great job of acquiring talent but finding talent in the cracks.

            “Their best players aren’t always No. 1 picks. They have been able to work free agency, G League, later draft picks and turn it into talent because their player development staff is so good.”

            TIP-INS

            Heat: Butler and Adebayo will likely be named All-Star reserves when the rosters are announced Thursday. Butler has been an All-Star six times, while Adebayo has only been selected once. ... Adebayo has scored in double figures in all 47 games this season, and 63 in a row dating to last season. Only Alonzo Mourning, Dwyane Wade and LeBron James have had longer streaks in team history.

            Cavaliers: G Ricky Rubio had eight points, five rebounds and five assists in 17 minutes. He's beginning to look more comfortable after returning from knee surgery. ... Kevin Love (back spasms) sat out his fourth consecutive game. ... Mobley was chosen to play in the 2023 Jordan Rising Stars at All-Star Weekend in Salt Lake City later this month.

            AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsCLEVELAND (AP) — Jimmy Butler scored 23 points, Bam Adebayo added 18 points and 11 rebounds and the Miami Heat showed their experience down the stretch in a 100-97 win over the Cleveland Cavaliers on Tuesday night.Caleb Martin scored 18 points and matched his career high with 10 rebounds, and Tyler Herro also scored 18 for the Heat, who moved within 1 1/2 games of the fifth-place Cavs in the Eastern Conference standings.After 45 up-and-down minutes, the Heat made key plays when it mattered most.“When it gets to the last three of four minutes, because of the experiences we’ve had, guys feel comfortable enough to execute under that kind of pressure,” Miami coach Erik Spoelstra said.Cavs coach J.B. Bickerstaff said Miami's maturity was the difference.“That's why they are who they are,” he said.Butler, who has been slowed by injuries for much of the season, hit a short jumper to put the Heat up 98-93 with 1:23 left, and his free throw — following a huge offensive rebound by Adebayo — kept the Heat ahead by five with 12 seconds left.Darius Garland's 3-pointer brought the Cavs within 99-97 with 8.7 seconds remaining. Cleveland fouled Butler with 7.3 seconds left, and he split his free throws, giving Cleveland a chance to tie.All-Star starter Donovan Mitchell rushed the ball up the floor but his contested 3-pointer at the buzzer was short.“They know who to key in on at that point,” Bickerstaff said. “But I thought (Mitchell) did a great job of creating separation and getting a shot off. I thought we got as good a look as we can at that point.”Butler was most pleased by Miami's defense in the closing minutes.“We still had lapses, but I'm glad those lapses did not cost us the game,” he said. “We got stops down the stretch when we needed to.”Evan Mobley scored 19 points, Mitchell had 16 and Jarrett Allen added 14 points and 11 rebounds for the Cavs, who dropped to 21-6 at home.Mitchell and Darius Garland were a combined 4 of 19 on 3-pointers.The NBA's top-rated defensive team, the Cavs came out looking to make everything difficult for the Heat offensively.Miami had no early answers and started 2 of 10 from the floor with five turnovers in the first five minutes, but Butler scored 11 points in the quarter while helping his teammates settle in.“We were disjointed at the beginning of the game, and I think Jimmy sensed that and went to work,” Spoelstra said.HEAT CHECKMiami has been one of the league's steadiest franchises, missing the playoffs just three times since 2008.It's a model Cleveland would like to follow.Bickerstaff admires both the Heat's consistency and ability to adapt. He credits Miami president Pat Riley and Spoelstra for leading the way.“They have a philosophy and are flexible enough to change with the times and keep people wanting to be a part of it,"" he said. “They have core values they believe in and then they do a great job of acquiring talent but finding talent in the cracks.“Their best players aren’t always No. 1 picks. They have been able to work free agency, G League, later draft picks and turn it into talent because their player development staff is so good.”TIP-INSHeat: Butler and Adebayo will likely be named All-Star reserves when the rosters are announced Thursday. Butler has been an All-Star six times, while Adebayo has only been selected once. ... Adebayo has scored in double figures in all 47 games this season, and 63 in a row dating to last season. Only Alonzo Mourning, Dwyane Wade and LeBron James have had longer streaks in team history.Cavaliers: G Ricky Rubio had eight points, five rebounds and five assists in 17 minutes. He's beginning to look more comfortable after returning from knee surgery. ... Kevin Love (back spasms) sat out his fourth consecutive game. ... Mobley was chosen to play in the 2023 Jordan Rising Stars at All-Star Weekend in Salt Lake City later this month.UP NEXTHeat: At New York on Thursday.Cavaliers: Host Memphis on Thursday.___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/02/01,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796777,Kuznetsov's OT goal lifts Capitals over Blue Jackets 4-3,"COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Evgeny Kuznetsov scored 26 seconds into overtime, and the Washington Capitals defeated the Columbus Blue Jackets 4-3 on Tuesday night.

            The win extended Washington’s lead over Pittsburgh for fourth place in the Metropolitan Division to three points.

            Trevor van Riemsdyk scored twice, Garnet Hathaway added a goal and Kuznetsov also contributed an assist. Charlie Lindgren stopped 31 shots.











            “We talked before the game how important these two points were going into the break — feeling good, a little positive vibes when we come back for the home stretch,” van Riemsdyk said.

            Andrew Peeke, Eric Robinson and Johnny Gaudreau scored for Columbus, which has lost three straight and seven of its last nine to remain in last place in the NHL. Joonas Korpisalo stopped 30 shots.

            Hathaway gave Washington the lead 5:06 into the first period. Van Riemsdyk made it 2-0 with 5:32 remaining before Peeke cut the lead in half 12 seconds later.

            “We started OK and then got lost at times along the way, just decisions with the puck,” Capitals coach Peter Laviolette said. “At the end of the day, they stayed with it. It wasn’t easy. It wasn’t clean. They stayed with it.”

            The teams traded goals in the second, with van Riemsdyk scoring his second at 8:26 and Robinson getting Columbus within one 2 ½ minutes later.

            Gaudreau’s goal at 12:44 of the third knotted the score 3-3.

            “I thought they battled all night,” Blue Jackets coach Brad Larsen said. “I thought it was a solid game by us and a few mistakes. There were some breakdowns, and it cost us there at the end.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796780,"Hong Kong bans CBD, forcing businesses to shut or revamp","HONG KONG (AP) — Hong Kong banned CBD as a “dangerous drug” and imposed harsh penalties for its possession on Wednesday, forcing fledging businesses to shut down or revamp.

            Supporters say CBD, or cannabidiol, derived from the cannabis plant, can help relieve stress and inflammation without getting its users high, unlike its more famous cousin THC, the psychoactive ingredient of marijuana which has long been illegal in Hong Kong. CBD was once legal in the city, and cafes and shops selling CBD-infused products were popular among young people. 

            But all that has changed with the prohibition, which took effect Wednesday but had been announced by the government last year. CBD-related businesses have closed down while others have struggled to remodel their businesses. Consumers dumped what they saw as a cure for their ailments into special collection boxes set up around the city. 











            The new rule reflects a zero-tolerance policy toward dangerous drugs in Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous southern Chinese business hub, as well as in mainland China, where CBD was banned in 2022. 

            The city maintains several categories of “dangerous drugs,” which include “hard drugs” such as heroin and cocaine. 

            In explaining the policy change, the Hong Kong government cited the difficulty of isolating pure CBD from cannabis, the possibility of contamination with THC during the production process and the relative ease by which CBD can be converted to THC.

            Customs authorities vowed last week to do more to educate residents to help them understand that CBD is prohibited in Hong Kong even though it is legal elsewhere.

            Starting Wednesday, possession of CBD can result in up to seven years in jail and a 1 million Hong Kong dollar ($128,000) fine. Those convicted of importing, exporting or producing the substance can face up to life in prison and a 5 million Hong Kong dollar ($638,000) fine. 

            Some users said the ban shows the international financial hub is going backward.

            “It’s just looking less like an international city,” said Jennifer Lo, the owner of CBD Bakery, who started selling CBD-infused cheesecakes, cookies and drinks in 2021. 

            Her business largely dried up even before the ban took effect, she said.

            “Rumors of the ban affected how I do business,” she said. “Some platforms just took me offline without telling me. And then it was not as easy to get space at markets.”

            To comply with the ban, Lo dumped all her remaining stock, including dozens of cookies, and said she would have to rebrand her business. 

            Some other vendors, including the city's first CBD cafe that opened in 2020, shut down.

            Karena Tsoi, who used CBD skincare products for two years to treat her eczema, said she will have to find an alternative treatment. 

            “It's troublesome,” she said. “The government doesn't have to regulate like this."" 

            Most Asian nations have strict drug laws with harsh penalties with the exception of Thailand, which made marijuana legal to cultivate and possess last year.

            Elsewhere, the debate over CBD continues. 

            The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said last week that there is not enough evidence about CBD to confirm that it’s safe for consumption in foods or as a dietary supplement. It called on Congress to create new rules for the growing market.

            Marijuana-derived products have become increasingly popular in lotions, tinctures and foods, while their legal status has been murky in the U.S., where several states have legalized or decriminalized substances that remain illegal federally.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796782,"Hawkins, Sanogo lead No. 24 UConn past DePaul, 90-76","CHICAGO (AP) — Jordan Hawkins, Adama Sanogo and Tristen Newton took turns coming up with big plays for No. 24 UConn.

            It was a nice night for the Huskies after one rough stretch.

            Hawkins scored 26 points and Sanogo had 25, leading UConn to a 90-76 victory over DePaul on Tuesday.











            The Huskies had dropped six of eight after a 14-0 start, including an 82-79 loss to No. 16 Xavier in their previous game last week. But they used their superior size to push around DePaul, scoring 42 points in the paint and building a 38-25 rebounding advantage.

            Newton scored 15 of his 21 points in the second half, continuing his strong play since he was shut out during an 85-74 loss at St. John's on Jan. 15. He is averaging 16.5 points in UConn's last four games.

            “Tristen's really evolving, improving, playing more like a guy that's in his second year with us,” coach Dan Hurley said, “in terms of picking his spots to be more aggressive.”

            UConn (17-6, 6-6 Big East) improved to 16-1 against DePaul in the series. The Blue Demons (9-14, 3-9) got their only victory over the Huskies 16 years ago.

            Javan Johnson scored 19 points for DePaul, which has dropped four straight and 10 of 13 overall. Da'Sean Nelson had 16, and Eral Penn finished with 13.

            “We've just got to get better, be more connected defensively,” coach Tony Stubblefield said.

            The Blue Demons trailed 59-39 after Sanogo's layup with 16:18 left. But Johnson's 3-pointer sparked an 18-4 run that trimmed the Huskies' lead to 63-57 midway through the second half.

            Newton then had a big four-point play for UConn, and an 8-0 run restored a comfortable margin for the Huskies for the final minutes.

            “Knew we needed some points, was confident enough to shoot it and it happened to go in,” Newton said of the four-point play.

            “It was a good momentum boost.”

            DePaul went 9 for 16 at the line in the second half, hurting its ability to rally.

            “We just couldn't put it together for 40 minutes,” Penn said.

            Sanogo had 12 points on 5-for-6 shooting when he was whistled for his second foul with 7:54 left in the first half, sending him to the bench. With their burly post player watching from the sideline, the Huskies responded.

            Hawkins sparked a 12-1 run with five straight foul shots, including three after he was fouled on a 3-point attempt. A driving layup for Newton and Hawkins' 3 made it 40-27 with 3:45 left.

            UConn shot 52% (17 for 33) on its way to a 46-33 halftime lead. Hawkins had 15 points at the break.

            “Just let my game come to me,” Hawkins said. “Don't really try to force anything out there.”

            Sanogo returned for the start of the second half and immediately asserted himself with a layup on UConn's first possession. He went 10 for 13 from the field for the game and finished with nine rebounds.

            BIG PICTURE

            UConn: The play of Hawkins and Newton, especially while Sanogo was hampered by foul trouble, is a positive sign for the Huskies as they try to put together a strong finish.

            DePaul: It was a tough night for Umoja Gibson, who had eight points on 3-for-10 shooting before fouling out with 3:58 remaining. Gibson was averaging a team-high 16.2 points coming into the game.

            UP NEXT

            UConn: At Georgetown on Saturday.

But they used their superior size to push around DePaul, scoring 42 points in the paint and building a 38-25 rebounding advantage.Newton scored 15 of his 21 points in the second half, continuing his strong play since he was shut out during an 85-74 loss at St. John's on Jan. 15. He is averaging 16.5 points in UConn's last four games.“Tristen's really evolving, improving, playing more like a guy that's in his second year with us,” coach Dan Hurley said, “in terms of picking his spots to be more aggressive.”UConn (17-6, 6-6 Big East) improved to 16-1 against DePaul in the series. The Blue Demons (9-14, 3-9) got their only victory over the Huskies 16 years ago.Javan Johnson scored 19 points for DePaul, which has dropped four straight and 10 of 13 overall. Da'Sean Nelson had 16, and Eral Penn finished with 13.“We've just got to get better, be more connected defensively,” coach Tony Stubblefield said.The Blue Demons trailed 59-39 after Sanogo's layup with 16:18 left. But Johnson's 3-pointer sparked an 18-4 run that trimmed the Huskies' lead to 63-57 midway through the second half.Newton then had a big four-point play for UConn, and an 8-0 run restored a comfortable margin for the Huskies for the final minutes.“Knew we needed some points, was confident enough to shoot it and it happened to go in,” Newton said of the four-point play.“It was a good momentum boost.”DePaul went 9 for 16 at the line in the second half, hurting its ability to rally.“We just couldn't put it together for 40 minutes,” Penn said.Sanogo had 12 points on 5-for-6 shooting when he was whistled for his second foul with 7:54 left in the first half, sending him to the bench. With their burly post player watching from the sideline, the Huskies responded.Hawkins sparked a 12-1 run with five straight foul shots, including three after he was fouled on a 3-point attempt. A driving layup for Newton and Hawkins' 3 made it 40-27 with 3:45 left.UConn shot 52% (17 for 33) on its way to a 46-33 halftime lead. Hawkins had 15 points at the break.“Just let my game come to me,” Hawkins said. “Don't really try to force anything out there.”Sanogo returned for the start of the second half and immediately asserted himself with a layup on UConn's first possession. He went 10 for 13 from the field for the game and finished with nine rebounds.BIG PICTUREUConn: The play of Hawkins and Newton, especially while Sanogo was hampered by foul trouble, is a positive sign for the Huskies as they try to put together a strong finish.DePaul: It was a tough night for Umoja Gibson, who had eight points on 3-for-10 shooting before fouling out with 3:58 remaining. Gibson was averaging a team-high 16.2 points coming into the game.UP NEXTUConn: At Georgetown on Saturday.DePaul: At Seton Hall on Sunday.___More AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/college-basketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/02/01,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796785,"Aho scores on power play in OT, Hurricanes rally past Kings","RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — The Carolina Hurricanes keep collecting comeback victories, and their latest was quite an accomplishment.

            Sebastian Aho scored on a power play with 53.8 seconds left in overtime and the Hurricanes overcame a three-goal deficit to beat the Los Angeles Kings 5-4 on Tuesday night.

            It’s the seventh time this season that the Metropolitan Division-leading Hurricanes have won after facing a third-period deficit.











            “We got our game going,” Aho said. “It wasn’t panic or anything like that. Winning this hockey game was pretty special, coming from three goals behind. Gives us a lot of belief.”

            Brent Burns, Paul Stastny, Jordan Staal and Teuvo Teravainen also scored for the Hurricanes, who trailed 4-1 entering the third period. Andrei Svechnikov had two assists and Frederik Andersen stopped 17 shots.

            “Give them credit for not packing it in,” Hurricanes coach Rod Brind’Amour said. “It’s 4-1 going to the third, not playing very well and then we decided to put a good effort up and got rewarded.”

            It was just the fifth time in 25 seasons that Carolina trailed by three goals in the third period and ended up with a victory.

            Aho has scored in five straight games as the Hurricanes extended their winning streak to six games and their points streak to nine games. Aho has a franchise-record eight career overtime goals.

            Adrian Kempe scored twice and Kevin Fiala and Anze Kopitar added goals for the Kings, who scored all four of their goals in the second period. Kopitar and Drew Doughty each had two assists, and Pheonix Copley made 26 saves. 

            “We knew they were going to push,” Kings coach Todd McLellan said of Carolina. “We thought we could handle it. I actually didn’t think we played a terrible period.”

            Carolina scored on three of its 10 shots in the third.

            This was the second unlikely result of the Hurricanes’ three-game homestand. They rallied from a two-goal deficit in the last two minutes of regulation in Friday night’s overtime win over San Jose.

            “Of course, we don’t want to be down that many goals,” Teravainen said. “We always have a feeling of just getting back in the game. Play strong, play our way and we’ll get a couple of goals and it happened again.”

            Teravainen’s fifth goal of the season with 7:29 to play in regulation forced overtime. It came on Carolina’s first power play of the game.

            Aho has a team-leading 22 goals, including seven in a five-game span.

            Kempe had the first and third goals for the Kings, giving him four two-goal games this season. He leads the Kings with 22 goals.

            The Kings wrapped up play prior to the All-Star break by going 3-2-1 on a season-high six-game trip.

            “It has been a long 12 days, dragged out here to the bitter end,” McLellan said. “The fact that we could come out above .500 is a good thing for us. Not a lot of teams from out West that are doing that.”

            NO YELLING HERE

            Brind’Amour was hoarse afterward.

            “My voice is gone, so wore me out,” he said.

            That might have prevented a full tongue-lashing from the coach during the second intermission.

            “Pretty calm,” Teravainen said of the scene between periods. “He was kind of losing his voice, so he didn’t want to yell too bad, I guess.”

            ICE MATTERS

            The Hurricanes improved to 19-2-4 when leading after the first period. … It was just the second Los Angeles game to go beyond regulation in January. The Kings won the other in overtime a week earlier at Philadelphia. … Stastny has goals in back-to-back games for the first time this season.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796786,Tkachuk’s late goal lifts Senators over Canadiens 5-4,"MONTREAL (AP) — Brady Tkachuk scored at 18:41 of the third period to lift the Ottawa Senators to a 5-4 win over the Montreal Canadiens on Tuesday night.

            The surging Senators will head into the NHL All-Star break with a sense of accomplishment, having extended their winning streak to four games.

            “It was big, I mean, getting a couple of middle fingers from a couple of fans. Chucky loved it,” said Stutzle about the winning goal. “Everyone knows he’s there for big moments and I think that was really big, giving us four wins before the break. I think now everybody can go into the break positive and happy.”











            Tim Stutzle scored two goals and added two assists, while Alex DeBrincat and Claude Giroux also found the back of the net for the visitors.

            Anton Forsberg made 28 saves.

            Rafael Harvey-Pinard kept the Canadiens in the game with two third-period goals. Kirby Dach and Mike Hoffman also scored for Montreal, which dropped its fourth in a row.

            “In rivalry games, I think both teams are going to bring their best,” Tkachuk said. “So for us to come out on top with all three games, I think it does say a lot about our character and how whenever we’re playing our game we’re a tough team to beat.”

            Jake Allen made 24 saves for the Canadiens and kept the dreaded Reverse Retro curse going as they hold a 0-6-1 record wearing light blue.

            “It’s a mix of emotions,” said Canadiens coach Martin St. Louis. “I didn’t like our first period but we fought in the second and the third. Of course you lose the game but on the hockey side of things and what we showed, I’m happy with the group.”

            St. Louis particularly liked Harvey-Pinard, who has been red-hot since his recall from the AHL’s Laval Rocket on Jan. 11. The 24-year-old seems unaffected by the Reverse Retro curse, grabbing his second two-goal game in light blue and adding six points (five goals, one assist) in seven games.

            “HP is showing us what he’s able to do,” said St. Louis. “I saw him a bit last year, I heard about him and I’m starting to discover who he is as well. He’s a guy you notice on the ice.”

            “(The recall) is going well right now,” said Harvey-Pinard. “I’m still not 100% satisfied with the little details but I think I’m doing a good job so I just need to play with consistency.”

            50 IN 50

            With an assist on Stutzle’s goal, Tkachuk reached the 50-point mark in his 50th game of the season. He became the fastest Senator to reach that mark since 2018-19.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796787,"Growing Fraud Incidents in Asia Driving FIs to Prioritise Technology Risk Management Strategy and Capabilities, New Survey Shows","SINGAPORE -  Media OutReach - 1 February 2023 - GBG (AIM:GBG), the global technology specialist in fraud and compliance management, identity verification and location data intelligence, today released its Asia Financial Institution Study, ""Combatting Escalating Fraud in a Digital World"". According to the TABInsights study commissioned by  GBG, Asia's top financial institutions (FIs) continue to be challenged by the expanding threat landscape in the past few years as well as the tightening of regulatory and enforcement measures. The study found more rigorous supervision and penalties have resulted in increased monetary losses in the form of regulatory fines, the highest-ranking component of fraud loss for 41 per cent of FIs—a change from the previous survey in 2020 wherein direct fraud losses was ranked highest.   The survey found that Asian FIs complete a higher number of transactions through mobile and online channels with the highest digital channel adoption seen in Indonesia (71 per cent), closely followed by Malaysia (70 per cent). Respondents said they expect the average daily digital transaction volume to surge by 70 per cent in 2025 compared to 2022. As more FIs expand their digital offerings in response to consumer behaviour shifts towards mobile and digital, managing the cost of increasing compliance has emerged as a key concern for 70 per cent of FIs, while the ability to scale fraud detection measures to growing digital transaction volumes (39 per cent) and identity verification (33 per cent) rank as the top challenges.   Dev Dhiman, Managing Director, APAC, GBG said: ""Open banking, interconnected devices and ecosystems, and increased digital adoption in general has elevated the risk of digital fraud and cyber-attacks, and expanded the perimeter of attack FIs face today. New technologies are being exploited every day by innovative perpetrators who continue to challenge FIs to escalate their technology risk management strategy and capabilities to comply with the increased scrutiny by regulators and customers alike.""   Stronger ML adoption in Asia but gaps in data standardisation remain a key challenge   The study revealed strong machine learning (ML) adoption in Indonesia (71 per cent) and Thailand (69 per cent), while third-party data is used more actively in China (77 per cent), Vietnam (73 per cent) and the Philippines (68 per cent) alongside robotic analytics in Singapore (63 per cent) and Malaysia (62 per cent) to address false positives, indicating a maturing ML landscape among Asian FIs. While the region saw increased adoption of ML-based algorithm tools with automated smart models to address fraud prevention in the sector—with 47 per cent of FIs actively using ML tools and 37 per cent beginning to use them—one of the biggest challenges for these organisations undergoing digitalisation is the increased complexities in addressing data standardisation and governance to scale fraud detection.   Some 38 per cent of FIs indicated that inadequate data standardisation is their most critical gap, alongside 32 per cent who are challenged by fragmented data because of piecemeal systems and software. In Thailand and China, fragmented data emerged as the top challenge for FIs. In Malaysia, after inadequate data standardisation, lack of good link analysis was also highlighted by 23 per cent as the top challenge. Meanwhile, 59 per cent of FIs said they increasingly rely on third-party data, alongside 58 per cent that use ML to address false positives.   The evolving risk dynamics in the industry are forcing institutions towards stronger data integration and technology tools to future-proof their fraud risk capabilities and ability to gather effective data insights. Increasingly, institutions seek to integrate a spectrum of transactions, devices and big data to strengthen fraud detection capabilities. Data from interconnected devices are being used by 78 per cent of FIs, while 76 per cent use transaction data and 64 per cent public data. In fact, 42 per cent of FIs indicated their need to prioritise and invest in one platform to interexchange application data and transaction data in 2022. Within the next year, 47 per cent of FIs plan to add internal unstructured data and geographic data to deepen their fraud detection.   Addressing risk management holistically requires cultural change   Despite many safeguards, fraudsters have remained one step ahead in employing modern technology to commit fraud and exploit loopholes. Respondents in the study recognise the need for a comprehensive enterprise-wide strategy for fraud control that includes data, technology, people, and procedures. A significant 48 per cent of FIs continually upskill and upgrade their human resource capabilities while 19 per cent actively hire new staff to meet the evolving requirements.   Additionally, increasing the application of scalable and intelligent technologies, such as AI and ML, enable advanced predictive and behaviour analytics for stronger real-time fraud management and effective anti-scam procedures. By harnessing new technologies and ecosystem partnerships to build capabilities for stronger identification, verification, and real-time threat detection, FIs can prevent increasingly innovative and technically advanced attacks.   ""The increased need to deepen threat detection, analysis and timely prevention capability requires a more strategic and structured approach that takes into account proactive multi-pronged data and technology initiatives, alongside robust identity verification and authentication tools,""  Bernardi Susastyo, General Manager, Asia, GBG said. ""In 2023, FIs would do well to address risk management holistically to ensure the initiatives they adopt integrate data across their organisations and the ecosystem, so that even as they improve their fraud prevention and risk management capabilities, they are not compromising customer experiences.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796806,"Blue Jays sign reliever Chad Green to $8.5M, 2-year deal","TORONTO (AP) — Free agent reliever Chad Green and the Toronto Blue Jays agreed to an $8.5 million, two-year contract on Tuesday.

            The deal includes options for 2025 and 2026 and could be worth $29.25 million over four seasons.

            Green is likely to miss at least the early portion of this season while recovering from Tommy John surgery. He injured his pitching elbow last May with the New York Yankees and was sidelined the rest of the year.











            The right-hander got off to a solid start last season with a 3.00 ERA and 16 strikeouts over 15 innings. He left New York's game against the Baltimore Orioles on May 19 with right forearm discomfort and three days later the Yankees announced he needed Tommy John surgery.

            Typical recovery time for the ligament-replacement procedure is 12-18 months.

            Green gets a $2.25 million salary this year, and the Blue Jays must decide after this season whether to exercise a club option calling for $9 million salaries in 2024, 2025 and 2026.

            Green has a conditional player option for 2024 at $6.25 million that can be exercised only if Toronto declines its option. Green’s conditional option includes performance bonuses of up to $1 million: $250,000 each for 40, 45, 50 and 55 appearances.

            If both the Blue Jays and Green decline their initial options, Toronto has a conditional option at $10.5 million annually for 2024 and 2025. Those options have $1 million in performance bonuses for appearances: $500,000 each for 60 and 65 games.

            The 31-year-old Green is 33-22 with a 3.17 ERA in seven major league seasons, all with the Yankees. He has 11 saves and 53 holds.

            Green has struck out 494 batters and walked only 96 in 383 2/3 innings. He set personal bests in 2021 with 10 wins, 67 appearances and 83 2/3 innings while posting a 3.12 ERA.

            To make room on the 40-man roster, left-handed pitcher Matt Gage was designated for assignment by Toronto.

            The Blue Jays also appointed Jeff Ware (bullpen) and David Howell (strategy) as assistant pitching coaches. The team said the rest of last year's big league coaching staff will return this season.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796807,Alabama routs Vanderbilt 101-44 for largest win over SEC foe,"TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) — Brandon Miller scored 22 points to help No. 4 Alabama rout Vanderbilt 101-44 on Tuesday night for the Crimson Tide's largest margin of victory over an SEC opponent ever.

            Alabama (19-3, 9-0 SEC) shot 59% from the field and 46% from 3-point range to pull off the fourth largest win in school history.

            “We tell our guys frequently to lose yourself in the game and the offense will take care of itself,” Alabama coach Nate Oats said. “The more you worry about how many shots you’re getting or if your shot’s going in, to me, that stuff backfires. The way you make shots is you get in the gym and work your tail off. All of our guys got in extra time with our assistants.”











            Nimari Burnett added 16 points, his first points after three scoreless games since returning from injury on Jan. 21. Three more Alabama players cracked double-digit points: Rylan Griffen with 12, Noah Gurley with 11 and Charles Bediako with 10.

            Mark Sears led all players with eight assists to go with nine points.

            Vanderbilt (10-12, 3-6) struggled mightily in the first half, shooting 15% (5-for-33). Freshman Paul Lewis was Vanderbilt’s lone double-digit scorer with 10 points.

            “Wrong team at the wrong time,” Vanderbilt coach Jerry Stackhouse said.

            LIAM ROBBINS RETURNS 

            Vanderbilt forward Liam Robbins scored nine points and added seven rebounds in his return to action after missing four games with an ankle injury. The Commodores lost three of the four games they played without Robbins, their leading scorer and rebounder.

            I thought we would have some energy with Liam being back in the lineup,” Stackhouse said. “I thought we had a spirited practice, good energy in shoot around this morning. I really can’t put my finger on why we were a step slow in everything we did tonight.”

            BIG PICTURE

            This was Alabama’s first game after seeing its nine-game winning streak snapped in a 93-69 loss to Oklahoma, a loss that followed a poor performance in a narrow win over Mississippi State. Oats thought the team had lost its edge; Tuesday’s performance suggests the Crimson Tide might have it back, thoroughly handling a Vanderbilt team that has a win over a ranked team in conference play, beating Arkansas on Jan. 14.

            “I told our guys nationally we’re being questioned as soft,” Oats said. “I think they answered the bell. They got the message. They really coached each other in the last three days, to be honest. They’re a great group and the kind of talked among themselves of who they want to be, how they want to get better, and they did.”

            Burnett confirmed the loss to Oklahoma is what brought the team to its renewed state of determination.

            “It was really that we didn’t play hard,” Burnett said. “We were complacent. We needed that loss, it’s helping us get better. It revealed some things we need to work on.”

            UP NEXT: 

            Vanderbilt starts a two-game home stand by hosting Ole Miss on Saturday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796808,"No. 8 Kansas avenges earlier loss to No. 7 K-State, 90-78","LAWRENCE, Kan. (AP) — Jalen Wilson remembers every slight. Every criticism. Every chip that's landed on his shoulder.

            You can bet the Kansas forward remembers watching Kansas State fans storm the court after beating the Jayhawks.

            So with revenge on their mind, Wilson and his pals jumped on the seventh-ranked Wildcats in the rematch Tuesday night. He finished with 20 points, Kevin McCullar Jr. had 16 points and 13 rebounds, and the No. 8 Jayhawks rolled to a 90-78 victory that also tightened the Big 12 standings at the midway point of conference play.











            “It was like a big rub in our face, them storming the court,” Wilson admitted. “I always remember stuff like that.”

            Dajuan Harris Jr. added 18 points for the Jayhawks (18-4, 6-3), who built a 12-point halftime lead before coasting to their 17th straight home win over K-State. They also won their second straight after a three-game skid, and made sure to avoid taking back-to-back losses inside Allen Fieldhouse for the first time since the 1988-89 season.

            “Hey, their guys are hard to guard. They've got a good team,” Kansas coach Bill Self said. “I actually thought we did a good job, for the most part, and our bench was terrific. That was the best our bench has played so far.”

            Markquis Nowell scored 23 points and Keyontae Johnson had 22 points and 12 boards to lead the Wildcats (18-4, 6-3), who were trying for their first regular-season sweep of their biggest rival in four decades. 

            Nae'Qwan Tomlin added 11 points for Kansas State. David N'Guessan had 10.

            “They play at a fast pace. You know they play better at home,” Nowell said. “They started early with turnovers. They got out in transition. They got the crowd involved. They had a huge first half and I feel like we dug ourselves a hole.”

            In their first meeting on Jan. 17, the Wildcats raced to a big early lead and controlled the game until late in the second half, when the Jayhawks forced overtime — only for Kansas State to win on Johnson's alley-oop dunk.

            It was the Jayhawks who controlled the rematch.

            They used a 16-7 run early in the game, built by speeding up the Wildcats and controlling the tempo. At one point, Kansas State coach Jerome Tang picked up a technical foul, and the Jayhawks stretched their lead to 32-19 in a blink.

            “I didn't want to get a technical. I didn't mind getting a technical, though,” Tang said. “I've been in here too many times where I feel like the crowd impacts the referees. And they're human beings, and this is no knock on them. I just wanted them to know I did not feel like the calls were being even on both ends.”

            The Wildcats answered with a run of their own, closing within 37-32. But that's when Wilson hit back-to-back 3-pointers and Zach Clemence, forced onto the court due to foul trouble among starters, added one of his own. 

            Kansas eventually led 49-37 at the break. And while the Wildcats briefly got within six in the second half, the outcome never seemed in jeopardy. The Jayhawks stretched their lead to 16 before cruising to the finish.

            “I thought we had a bunch of self-inflicted wounds,” Tang said. “Part of it was the environment, part of it was the scheme and how we tried to attack them. We’ll go back and look at it.”

            OFFICIATING OOPS

            Johnson had to sit with two fouls just 2 1/2 minutes into the game. Only problem? The crew of John Higgins, Kip Kissinger and Marques Pettigrew gave one to the wrong player. By the time they corrected their mistake, the Wildcats' leading scorer had unnecessarily ridden the bench for several minutes.

            SELLOUT ... AND THEN SOME

            For the first time in more than 15 years, more Kansas students redeemed tickets than there was space available inside Allen Fieldhouse. The overflow had to watch the game on screens in the adjacent Horejsi Family Athletics Center, where the Jayhawks play volleyball games. Those students also got refunds and concessions vouchers.

            BIG PICTURE

            Kansas State's three losses in league play have been to ranked teams on the road: TCU, Iowa State and Kansas. And with a more forgiving second half to the Big 12 schedule, the Wildcats remain firmly in the conference title hunt.

            Kansas got its mojo back with its win at Kentucky last weekend. This victory over another bunch of Wildcats was crucial because the road doesn't get any easier for the Jayhawks, who are in the midst of three straight games against ranked teams.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796810,"LeBron James has triple-double, Lakers outlast Knicks in OT","NEW YORK (AP) — LeBron James moved within 89 points of breaking the NBA’s career scoring record and climbed into fourth place on the assists list, finishing with a triple-double in his return to Madison Square Garden as the Los Angeles Lakers beat the New York Knicks 129-123 in overtime Tuesday night.

            James had 28 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds, with the points giving him 38,299 for his career. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar is the leader with 38,387.

            But the 38-year-old James’ game has always been about more than scoring, as he proved again Tuesday with his first triple-double of the season. He fed Dennis Schroder for a 3-pointer that snapped a 118-all tie with 3:13 remaining, grabbed his 10th rebound later in the extra period and then powered to the basket for a 127-121 lead with 19 seconds to go.











            He had earlier moved ahead of Mark Jackson and then Steve Nash into fourth place on the assists list during his first game at Madison Square Garden in three years.

            Anthony Davis added 27 points and nine rebounds for the Lakers, who had dropped two straight to open their trip. Both James and Davis had sat out their loss Monday night in Brooklyn.

            Jalen Brunson scored 37 points for New York. Julius Randle had 23 points and 12 rebounds.

            Jokic finished with 26 points, 18 rebounds and 15 assists as the Western Conference leaders improved to 16-0 when Jokic has a triple-double. Murray made a season-high seven 3-pointers.

            CJ McCollum and Herbert Jones each scored 21 points for the Pelicans. They have dropped nine straight games to finish 3-13 in January.

            “That’s the reason we’ve been winning, because our defense has picked it up and carried us,” George said. “I think we caught our rhythm because of our defense and were able to stay in the game.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796814,Nikki Haley planning Feb. 15 launch for 2024 White House bid,"COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — Nikki Haley is moving closer to making her presidential campaign official.

            On Wednesday, supporters of the former South Carolina governor will get an email invitation to a Feb. 15 launch event in Charleston, at which she plans to announce her campaign, according to a person familiar with the plans but not authorized to speak publicly about them.

            News of Haley's plans was first reported by The Post and Courier of Charleston.











            Haley, 51, served as South Carolina's governor for six years before serving as President Donald Trump's ambassador to the United Nations. When she enters the race, Haley will be the first contender to join the contest against her former boss, who is currently the sole Republican seeking his party's 2024 nomination. 

            
                Trump was in South Carolina Saturday for the initial campaign swing of his 2024 campaign, standing alongside Gov. Henry McMaster — who served as Haley's lieutenant governor — and several GOP members of the state's delegation, part of his leadership team in the early-voting state.

            During the Trump administration, Haley feuded at times with other White House officials while bolstering her own public persona. Her 2018 departure fueled speculation that she would challenge Trump in 2020, or replace Vice President Mike Pence on the ticket, but Haley did neither. 

            Instead, Haley returned to South Carolina, where she bought a home on Kiawah Island, joined the board of aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and launched herself on the speaking circuit, reportedly commanding fees as high as $200,000. She penned two books, a step commonly taken by many on the road toward the White House.

            After the Jan. 6 Capitol siege, Haley initially cast doubts on Trump’s political future but said she wouldn’t challenge him in 2024. 

            In 2021, Haley told The Associated Press that she “would not run if President Trump ran,” but she has since shifted course, ramping up activity through her Stand for America nonprofit and political action committee, and endorsing dozens of candidates in the 2022 midterm elections. 

            Late last year, during a visit to her alma mater, Haley told an audience at Clemson University that she would be “taking the holidays” to consider a run. 

            Asked recently why she is now considering a run in spite of her 2021 comments, Haley told Fox News “a lot has changed,” referencing, among other things, U.S. economic troubles. 

            She went on to say she felt she could be part of “new generational change,” an indirect reference to Trump’s advanced age.

            In South Carolina on Saturday, Trump told WIS-TV that Haley had called him several days earlier to seek his opinion. Trump pointed out her earlier pledge not to run against him but said he made no attempts to stop her.

            “She said she would never run against me because I was the greatest president, but people change their opinions, and they change what's in their hearts,” Trump said. “So I said, if your heart wants to do it, you have to go do it.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796815,Bucks beat Hornets 124-115 for 5th consecutive victory,"MILWAUKEE (AP) — Khris Middleton is making the most of his limited minutes as he works his way back from injuries that kept him from playing for much of the season.

            Middleton scored 18 points and sparked a third-quarter run that put the Milwaukee Bucks ahead for good as they beat the Charlotte Hornets 124-115 on Tuesday night for their fifth straight victry. 

            “Right now I'm trying to be as aggressive as I can,” Middleton said. “I know it sounds simple or whatever, but that's just the mindset I'm trying to come up with, especially with my limited minutes. Hopefully as my minutes keep going (up), I keep the same mindset, because it's been working.""











            The Bucks withstood a triple-double from Charlotte’s LaMelo Ball, who had 27 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds.

            Giannis Antetokounmpo had 34 points and 18 rebounds to help the Bucks avenge one of their most embarrassing losses of the season. Jrue Holiday added 15 points and a career-high 13 rebounds.

            Middleton played 20 minutes, his longest outing since coming back from a sore right knee that caused him to miss 18 games. The three-time All-Star also missed the Bucks' first 20 games while recovering from offseason surgery on his left wrist. 

            He has come off the bench in each of the Bucks' five games since his return.

            “I started my career coming off the bench, so it doesn't really bother me at all,” Middleton said. “I've been on the bench before, not playing games, sometimes coming in first quarter, second quarter or sometimes not until the second half. I just know I have to stay ready and have to be loose.”

            In a game that featured 11 ties and 17 lead changes, Middleton helped Milwaukee gain command. He scored 11 points during a 14-3 spurt late in the third quarter that helped the Bucks take a 97-90 lead into the final period. 

            “He got going when they kind of took control of the game,” Hornets coach Steve Clifford said. 

            Charlotte (16-36) entered the night with the fourth-worst record in the NBA, but the Hornets won 138-109 at Milwaukee on Jan. 6 to hand the Bucks their second-most lopsided loss of the season. The Hornets had 51 points in the opening period that night — matching the NBA record for a first quarter — and limited Antetokounmpo to nine points.

            Even after scoring 50 points in a 135-110 victory over the New Orleans Pelicans on Sunday, Antetokounmpo spent part of his postgame press conference talking about how the Bucks needed to play better in the rematch with the Hornets. 

            The Hornets still made this one interesting. 

            Milwaukee took a 114-97 lead on Antetokounmpo's 3-pointer with 7:13 left. but didn't make another basket until Antetokounmpo's driving layup with 27.1 seconds remaining.

            Charlotte cut it to 118-113 when Mason Plumlee hit a layup and drew a foul with 1:06 left. But Plumlee missed the ensuing free throw, and the Bucks put it away from there.

            “Their record doesn't give them justice,” Antetokounmpo said. “They're a really good team. Or maybe they just play well against us. I don't know.”

            Terry Rozier scored 20 points, Gordon Hayward 16, Jalen McDaniels 15 and P.J. Washington and Plumlee 14 each for Charlotte. Plumlee also had 14 rebounds.

            James moved within 89 points of breaking the career scoring record and climbed into fourth place on the assists list, finishing with his first triple-double of the season in his return to Madison Square Garden as the Los Angeles Lakers beat the New York Knicks 129-123 in overtime Tuesday night.

            James had 28 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds, with the points giving him 38,299 for his career. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar is the leader with 38,387.

            But James' game has always been about more than scoring, as he proved again Tuesday. He fed Dennis Schroder for a 3-pointer that snapped a 118-all tie with 3:13 remaining, grabbed his 10th rebound later in the extra period and then powered to the basket for a 127-121 lead with 19 seconds to go.

            “He’s just doing it all,” Lakers coach Darvin Ham said. “That’s what great players do. That’s what all-time greats do, and he’s right up there at the top of the list with all of them.” 

            James had earlier moved ahead of Mark Jackson and then Steve Nash into fourth place on the assists list during his first game at Madison Square Garden in three years.

            Anthony Davis added 27 points and nine rebounds for the Lakers, who had dropped two straight to open their trip. Both James and Davis had sat out their loss Monday in Brooklyn. 

            Jalen Brunson scored 37 points and Julius Randle had 23 points and 12 rebounds for the Knicks, who were 7 for 34 from 3-point range and dropped their second straight.

            “We’re scoring plenty, that’s not our issue,” Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said. “So we’ve got to shore up our defense.”

            James was fuming following his last game, the' Lakers loss in overtime in Boston on Saturday, after which referees said they missed a foul on his drive to the basket to end regulation. 

            He then sat out Monday with what Ham said was left foot soreness, though the Lakers had listed the injury as an ankle. They listed him as questionable to play in the morning, then upgraded James to available after he moved well during a pregame workout.

            He certainly didn't want to miss this one after being hurt two years ago and suspended last season for striking Detroit's Isaiah Stewart in the face. His last game here was Jan. 22, 2000, when he was days away from passing Kobe Bryant into third place on the career scoring list.

            Now the only one left to catch is Abdul-Jabbar, which could happen in the next 10 days. James said getting closer doesn't make it feel any heavier.

            “I’m not going anywhere, I’m going to be in this league for at least a few more years,” he said. “So I’m going to do it, so it’s not heavy at all.”

            The game was tied at 90 before James fed Troy Brown Jr. for a 3-pointer with his eighth assist, then set up Thomas Bryant for a dunk that moved him ahead of Jackson and then Nash into fourth place for assists. He has 10,338 assists.

            James has always called MSG one of his favorite places to play and this visit draw a sellout crowd that included celebrities such as Michael J. Fox, Michael B. Jordan, Emma Stone and Chris Rock. Fans filled seats in the lower sections of the arena just to watch James warm up, but he struggled to give them one of his vintage performances once the game began.

            He threw up an airball in the second quarter as part of his 2-for-8 start, but made his final two shots of the half, then threw a pass that Schroder heaved in from halfcourt to beat the buzzer and cut it to 53-52 at halftime. 

            Recently acquired Rui Hachimura had 19 points and nine rebounds for the Lakers, while Russell Westbrook added 17 points and eight assists, with three of them in OT.

Its location on the bank of Ping River offers a serene environment that is further enhanced by its lush gardens and rustic but elegant architectural and interior designs infused with natural elements.Much of the furniture and decor utilized throughout Raya Heritage are made by local artisans from several communities with specialties ranging from weaving, dyeing, woodcarving, to potting.Vichada Sitakalin, the resort’s designer, said she chose the furniture and decor items with sustainability in mind: “Sustainability is very important to me. I appreciate culture. I appreciate craftsmanship. I appreciate the old ways of doing things … In the past, people were much better at sustainability than we are today. Organic wasn’t a novel concept back then, it was a way of life.”Sitting on the bank of Ping River and boasting lush gardens, Raya Heritage cultivates a tranquil and natural ambience. (Raya Heritage photo)The resort was built with sustainability and growth with local communities in mind, using furniture and decor sourced from local artisans throughout the resort. (Taiwan News, Stephanie Chiang photo)The resort offers 38 suites, including the Rin Terrace and Huen Bon suites that offer spacious outdoor terraces overlooking Ping River, as well as the Kraam Pool suites that come with private pools. The three types of suites are decorated with their own color accents that compliment Raya Heritage’s underlying white theme — black for Rin Terrace Suites, beige for Huen Bon Suites, and indigo for Kraam Pool Suites.In addition to a consistent color palette, the resort also highlights the local culture and lifestyle, which is tied to the river and fishing. Accessories and artifacts used to decorate suites, hallways, and walls take the shape of boats, nets, and fish baskets.Huen Bon Suites’ white and beige color palette enhances Raya Heritage’s rustic style.

On weekends, patrons may choose to attend a yoga session on the bank of Ping River, which is offered as part of the resort’s daily cultural activities program.Breakfast is offered at the Khu Khao Restaurant in the form of all-you-can-eat a la carte. The wide variety of choices range from bread baskets, eggs, salads, fish, rice dishes, to yogurt and oatmeal, all of which come in moderate servings that allow patrons to try several different items within the same meal.Sunrise as seen from Raya Heritage.

The dishes are seasoned with a list of spices that pack distinct flavors and textures, and while many are spicy, there are still mild-flavored options that are equally rich in taste.Other dining options at Raya Heritage include the Laan Cha Tea Terrace, which offers afternoon tea and snacks, as well as the Baan Ta Lounge and Lawn, which offers cocktails and light evening meals.The Khu Khao Restaurant specializes in fusion cuisine that blends Thai, Yunnanese, Burmese, and Lao flavors.

Its signature package, “A Day of Eco Valley,” provides patrons with a tour guide and driver and takes them on a trip to Doi Inthanon National Park, which is popular among both international and domestic tourists.Some highlights of the excursion include a stop at the Wachirathan Falls, a guided hike on the scenic Kew Mae Pan Nature Trail, and a visit to the twin pagodas (Phra Mahathat Napha Methanidon and Phra Mahathat Naphaphon Bhumisiri) built in honor of Thailand’s late King King Bhumibol Adulyadej and Queen Sirikit. Along the way, an experienced guide working with Raya Heritage provides detailed information about not only the attractions but also the local culture, history, and geography.Two other major parts of the tour provide even more special experiences.

            Let the lobbying begin.

            “I feel we're getting punished because we played two bad games. When I watch everyone else play bad games, they don't seem to get punished,” Willard said. “So I think it's my job to start letting everybody realize we kicked a lot of people's (butt) at the beginning of the year, we had two big guys hurt, and now we're playing pretty good basketball.""











            Jahmir Young scored 20 points, Donta Scott added 19 and Maryland snapped No. 21 Indiana's five-game winning streak with a 66-55 victory Tuesday night. The Terrapins gave their NCAA Tournament hopes another boost, adding a victory over the Hoosiers to a resume that already included wins over Miami, Illinois and Ohio State.

            The Terps also lost by 27 to UCLA and by 35 at Michigan, but the fact that Willard is even in a position to state his case shows how much they've improved during his first season in charge. Maryland (15-7, 6-5 Big Ten) is now 12-1 at home.

            Maryland won despite shooting 34% from the field and 5 of 22 from 3-point range. The Terps were able to defend just about everything Indiana tried, double-teaming Trayce Jackson-Davis and limiting the Hoosiers (15-7, 6-5) to 11 attempts from beyond the arc.

            “Our perimeter play was nonexistent tonight,"" Indiana coach Mike Woodson said. “They shoot 30%, 20-something% from the 3, you've got to think that you can win a game when that happens.”

            Jackson-Davis did have 18 points and 20 rebounds. He surpassed 1,000 in the latter category for his career.

            Maryland attempted 10 3-pointers in the first 10 minutes, making only one, but the Terps made up for their spotty shooting by taking excellent care of the ball. They didn't have a single turnover in the first half and went into the break with a 37-29 lead.

            Indiana scored the first six points after halftime, but Maryland answered with a four-point possession thanks to an intentional foul by Tamar Bates, who was trying to stop Ian Martinez on a fast break.

            Indiana never got back within two again.

            Young scored inside to give the Terps a 54-42 advantage, and although the Hoosiers crept back with a 7-0 run, they weren't able to solve Maryland's defense with any consistency.

            “Trayce did a good job of handling the double teams and making crosscourt passes, but we decided we were going to live with that today,"" Young said. “Just trying to make it uncomfortable for him.”

            Jalen Hood-Schifino, Indiana's No. 2 scorer this season, was held to three points on 1-of-14 shooting.

            BIG PICTURE

            Indiana: The Hoosiers had a chance to take a lengthy winning streak into their in-state showdown with top-ranked Purdue this weekend, but they fell flat against Maryland.

            Maryland: The Terps showed they could topple a good team at home even on a very poor shooting night — because they didn't beat themselves. They finished with only five turnovers.

            “They're a very talented team, and we just had to value the basketball,” Young said. “Just trying to be sharp with everything that we did.”

            MILESTONE

            Jackson-Davis needed 10 rebounds to reach 1,000, and he made it there before halftime. The combination of the Terps' poor shooting and their low turnover count gave him plenty of opportunities.

            With 1,010 rebounds now, he's closing in on the top three players on Indiana's career list: Alan Henderson (1,091), Walt Bellamy (1,087) and Kent Benson (1,031).

            UP NEXT

            Indiana: The Hoosiers host No. 1 Purdue on Saturday.

            Maryland: The Terps play at Minnesota on Saturday night.

            More AP college basketball: http://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25COLLEGE PARK, Md. (AP) — Kevin Willard's team made another statement on the court, then the Maryland coach spoke out about his group's chances of making the NCAA Tournament.Let the lobbying begin.“I feel we're getting punished because we played two bad games. When I watch everyone else play bad games, they don't seem to get punished,” Willard said. “So I think it's my job to start letting everybody realize we kicked a lot of people's (butt) at the beginning of the year, we had two big guys hurt, and now we're playing pretty good basketball.""Jahmir Young scored 20 points, Donta Scott added 19 and Maryland snapped No. 21 Indiana's five-game winning streak with a 66-55 victory Tuesday night.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796887,No. 15 TCU without Miles in 76-72 win over West Virginia,"FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) — Damion Baugh had 16 points and 10 assists, big man Eddie Lampkin Jr. made an unexpected return from injury and 15th-ranked TCU overcame the absence of top scorer Mike Miles Jr. to beat West Virginia 76-72 on Tuesday night.

            JaKobe Coles had 17 points, Shahada Wells 16 points and Xavier Cork 15 for the Horned Frogs (17-5, 6-3 Big 12), who wrapped up the first half of their conference schedule in a four-way tie with No. 7 Kansas State, No. 8 Kansas and No. 13 Iowa State for second place. They are all one game behind league-leading No. 10 Texas.

            Erik Stevenson had 17 points and Tre Mitchell 15 for West Virginia (13-9, 2-7). 











            Wells was in TCU's starting lineup with Miles out because of a hyperextended right knee. The Big 12's second-leading scorer (18.1 points per game) got hurt less than four minutes into the Frogs' loss Saturday at Mississippi State. 

            Lampkin, their leading rebounder, had missed the last two games because of a left high ankle sprain and wasn't expected to play against West Virginia. But the 6-foot-11 center, entered after the first media timeout, and in just over a minute had a layup and then a bounce-pass assist to Baugh for another TCU basket. 

            The Horned Frogs missed their next eight shots, and West Virginia was within 16-15 when Stevenson hit a floater midway through the first half. But the Mountaineers never regained the lead, and never got closer than their four-point halftime deficit. 

            BIG PICTURE

            West Virginia: Stevenson, the fifth-year senior transfer from South Carolina, was coming off a 31-point game against Auburn that earned him Big 12 newcomer of the week honors. But the guard got off to a slow start against TCU, going 1-of-5 with only two points before halftime. He had WVU's first three baskets after halftime before the Frogs scored the next seven points for an 11-point lead. 

            TCU: Even though Lampkin played only eight minutes and was clearly still hobbled, his high-energy play provided a big boost for the Horned Frogs. He first entered during the middle of a spurt that put them ahead to stay. TCU, which last year got its first NCAA Tournament win in 35 years, needs Lampkin and Miles healthy down the stretch. An MRI on Miles showed no ligament damage, though the timetable for his return is still uncertain. 

            UP NEXT

            West Virginia is home Saturday night against Oklahoma, which beat the Mountaineers 77-76 on Jan. 14.

They are all one game behind league-leading No. 10 Texas.Erik Stevenson had 17 points and Tre Mitchell 15 for West Virginia (13-9, 2-7).Wells was in TCU's starting lineup with Miles out because of a hyperextended right knee. The Big 12's second-leading scorer (18.1 points per game) got hurt less than four minutes into the Frogs' loss Saturday at Mississippi State.Lampkin, their leading rebounder, had missed the last two games because of a left high ankle sprain and wasn't expected to play against West Virginia. But the 6-foot-11 center, entered after the first media timeout, and in just over a minute had a layup and then a bounce-pass assist to Baugh for another TCU basket.The Horned Frogs missed their next eight shots, and West Virginia was within 16-15 when Stevenson hit a floater midway through the first half. But the Mountaineers never regained the lead, and never got closer than their four-point halftime deficit.BIG PICTUREWest Virginia: Stevenson, the fifth-year senior transfer from South Carolina, was coming off a 31-point game against Auburn that earned him Big 12 newcomer of the week honors. But the guard got off to a slow start against TCU, going 1-of-5 with only two points before halftime. He had WVU's first three baskets after halftime before the Frogs scored the next seven points for an 11-point lead.TCU: Even though Lampkin played only eight minutes and was clearly still hobbled, his high-energy play provided a big boost for the Horned Frogs. He first entered during the middle of a spurt that put them ahead to stay. TCU, which last year got its first NCAA Tournament win in 35 years, needs Lampkin and Miles healthy down the stretch. An MRI on Miles showed no ligament damage, though the timetable for his return is still uncertain.UP NEXTWest Virginia is home Saturday night against Oklahoma, which beat the Mountaineers 77-76 on Jan. 14.TCU plays Saturday at Oklahoma State.___AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/college-basketball and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/02/01,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796889,"Australia targets Myanmar, Iran with economic sanctions","Australia on Wednesday announced targeted financial sanctions and travel bans against “individuals responsible for egregious human rights abuses” in Myanmar two years after a military junta seized power in the Southeast Asian country.

            Australia also imposed additional sanctions on Iranian individuals and entities over “abhorrent abuses of human rights,” a government statement said.

            The Myanmar sanctions target 16 members of the military’s governing regime and two military-controlled entities, the government said. The entities are Myanmar Economic Public Holdings Ltd. and Myanmar Economic Corp.











            Two successive Australian governments had resisted calls to impose sanctions on Myanmar since the military takeover on Feb. 1, 2021, while Sydney economist Sean Turnell, an adviser to Myanmar’s elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi, was detained by the military.

            Turnell was sentenced to three years in prison for violating Myanmar’s official secrets law and immigration law but was released in November as part of a broader prisoner amnesty and deported.

            But the junta issued a decree in December that has circulated on social media, annulling his amnesty and ordering him to appear in a Myanmar court for spreading “misinformation” in the media.

            Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said in a statement last week the government was “deeply concerned” that Myanmar had annulled Turnell’s amnesty and issued a subpoena for him to appear in court.

            “The Australian government never accepted the basis of Prof. Turnell’s detention, nor the charges against him, and we are disappointed that he is now being asked to answer for an undefined offence following his release from detention,” the statement said.

            Turnell has advocated Australian sanctions against Myanmar since his release.

            “Sanctions would cause negligible-to-zero effect on the average person in Myanmar and nothing compared to the suffering that’s occurred under the junta,” Turnell told The Australian newspaper before the sanctions were announced.

            The new sanctions against Iran target individuals and entities involved in the violent crackdown on protests since 22-year-old Mahsa Amini died in September last year while being held by the morality police.

            The sanctions also target individuals and entities involved in supplying drones to Russia. Russia has targeted Ukrainian civilians and civilian infrastructure with Iranian-made drones, the government said.

(AP) — Antonio Reeves came off the bench to score a season-high 27 points, Oscar Tshiebwe had a double-double and Kentucky pulled away for a 75-66 victory over Mississippi on Tuesday night.

            Reeves sank 8 of 12 shots from the floor, including 6 of 7 from 3-point range, and made all five of his free throws for the Wildcats (15-7, 6-3 Southeastern Conference).

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796893,South Korea logs record trade deficit as tech demand falls,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea logged its biggest monthly trade deficit ever, at $12.7 billion in January, as exports of computer chips and other high-tech items sank and costs for importing oil and gas surged, the trade ministry said Wednesday. 

            The growing shortfall underscored how Russia’s war on Ukraine is straining the global economy, keeping prices for key resources like crude oil and nickel high even after they fell back from spikes in 2022.

            South Korea’s export-dependent economy has logged a deficit for 11 consecutive months, the longest streak since 1997 when it was on the cusp of the Asian financial crisis. 











            Exports of computer chips, South Korea’s most important product, declined by nearly 45% last month from a year earlier because of slowing demand and falling chip prices, according to South Korea’s Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy. 

            The trade data was released after South Korean chip giant Samsung Electronics reported that its profit for the last quarter plunged by nearly 70% in what it described as a “significantly” deteriorated business environment for its semiconductors and consumer electronics products. 

            Chip making is highly cyclical, and tech industries have swung from stark shortages for many computer chips, felt across many industries including automaking, to a glut. 

            Samsung said chip prices fell sharply amid weakened demand as clients adjusted their inventories in face of “deepening uncertainties” in the global economy, a problem the company says will likely extend through this quarter.

            On Wednesday, SK Hynix, another major South Korean chipmaker, reported an operating loss of 1.7 trillion won ($1.4 billion) for the October-December period, which marked its first quarterly deficit since 2012. 

            “With uncertainties still lingering, we will continue to reduce investments and costs, while trying to minimize the impact of the downturn by prioritizing markets with high growth potential,"" the company said in a statement. 

            SK Hynix announced plans in October to reduce its investments in 2023 by more than a half compared to the 19 trillion won ($15 billion) it spent in 2022. 

            The trade ministry said the country’s exports during January declined by nearly 17% from a year earlier, with the modest increase in the sales of cars, petroleum products and ships failing to offset the larger drop in semiconductor shipments.

            The country, which depends on imports to provide most of its energy supplies, spent nearly $16 billion purchasing fuel, gas and coal last month. This was considerably higher than the average of $10 billion the country spent to import those items during the Januarys of the previous 10 years, senior trade official Moon Dong-min said.

            “The global economy remains sluggish, due to the contractionary policies of major economies and the prolonging of Russia’s war on Ukraine,” Moon said in a briefing. 

            He said the war, which has left countries grappling with higher prices and slower growth, has taken a similar toll on other economies dependent on industrial exports, including China, Japan and Germany.

            Moon said the global semiconductor market will likely remain sluggish over the next few months before recovering in the later half of the year following the depletion of existing inventories.

            “If the exports of semiconductors recover, that would be a huge help in letting our (country’s) exports recover,” Moon said.SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea logged its biggest monthly trade deficit ever, at $12.7 billion in January, as exports of computer chips and other high-tech items sank and costs for importing oil and gas surged, the trade ministry said Wednesday.The growing shortfall underscored how Russia’s war on Ukraine is straining the global economy, keeping prices for key resources like crude oil and nickel high even after they fell back from spikes in 2022.South Korea’s export-dependent economy has logged a deficit for 11 consecutive months, the longest streak since 1997 when it was on the cusp of the Asian financial crisis.Exports of computer chips, South Korea’s most important product, declined by nearly 45% last month from a year earlier because of slowing demand and falling chip prices, according to South Korea’s Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy.The trade data was released after South Korean chip giant Samsung Electronics reported that its profit for the last quarter plunged by nearly 70% in what it described as a “significantly” deteriorated business environment for its semiconductors and consumer electronics products.Chip making is highly cyclical, and tech industries have swung from stark shortages for many computer chips, felt across many industries including automaking, to a glut.Samsung said chip prices fell sharply amid weakened demand as clients adjusted their inventories in face of “deepening uncertainties” in the global economy, a problem the company says will likely extend through this quarter.On Wednesday, SK Hynix, another major South Korean chipmaker, reported an operating loss of 1.7 trillion won ($1.4 billion) for the October-December period, which marked its first quarterly deficit since 2012.“With uncertainties still lingering, we will continue to reduce investments and costs, while trying to minimize the impact of the downturn by prioritizing markets with high growth potential,"" the company said in a statement.SK Hynix announced plans in October to reduce its investments in 2023 by more than a half compared to the 19 trillion won ($15 billion) it spent in 2022.The trade ministry said the country’s exports during January declined by nearly 17% from a year earlier, with the modest increase in the sales of cars, petroleum products and ships failing to offset the larger drop in semiconductor shipments.The country, which depends on imports to provide most of its energy supplies, spent nearly $16 billion purchasing fuel, gas and coal last month.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796895,WeTV Kickstarts 2023 with Strong Momentum for Partnership and Content,"WeTV reaffirms its commitments to Southeast Asia with quarterly roadshows on local projects and collaborations

SINGAPORE -  Media OutReach - 1 February 2023 -  WeTV, Southeast Asia's leading video-on-demand (VOD) and over-the-top platform (OTT), has achieved resounding success in its premium subscription services. Additionally, WeTV's transactional subscription services (including fast track, rent, and EXPRESS) made up around 10% of its 2022's annual income. Reflecting its ongoing appeal for consumers and emerging opportunities for advertisers, WeTV will be ramping up engagement with partners and advertisers with quarterly roadshows in the region in 2023.            Ranked one of the top three OTT platforms in Southeast Asian markets such as Indonesia and Thailand, WeTV has seen continued growth in its user base with approximately 40% growth in subscription income, supported by a 20% growth in monthly active users. The consumption time of Chinese dramas has increased by 15% year-on-year (YoY), and the aired duration of WeTV Chinese mini-series[1] also surged by an impressive 420%, reflecting a stronger consumer demand and appetite for shorter video content.   ""WeTV's strong growth in 2022 reflects that consumers were able and willing to pay for high-quality content that WeTV offers, given the projected annual growth rate in the OTT market over the next few years,"" said  Jeff Han, WeTV Director and Vice President of Tencent Video.  ""Our strong performance last year is testament to our compelling content line-up which appeals to regional audiences. This year, we will continue to work with partners to invest in producing top-quality original shows that consumers desire, particularly our WeTV mini-series, given its massive increase in popularity over the past year.""   Additionally, WeTV has undergone user interface upgrades for its platform last year to provide an enhanced browsing and viewing experience for its users. Under the ""Shows You Might Like"" feature in the application, users are provided with more relevant choices based on what they like to watch.   Partnerships   To ensure sustained collaboration with renowned international brands and agencies, WeTV will hold partner roadshows in Southeast Asia every quarter to share upcoming projects and explore new partnership opportunities. Currently, advertising agencies such as GroupM, Omnicom Media Group (OMG), and Dentsu are tapping on WeTV's growing influence to reach out to their target audiences. WeTV will continue to target advertisers in their priority industries namely Computers, Communications, and Consumer Electronics (3C), Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG), and Cosmetics and Personal Care.   Against the backdrop of the rapidly expanding market for mobile-first OTT services, WeTV has also become a solid partner of local leading operators and telecommunication service providers, such as Telkomsel and Indihome in Indonesia as well as AIS in Thailand.   ""As we aim to be a world-class digital lifestyle solutions provider, Telkomsel is excited to partner with top content providers such as WeTV,"" said  Derrick Heng, Chief Marketing Officer of Telkomsel.  ""The partnership we have with WeTV have shown great results in terms of package transactions, increase in subscribers and payload consumption. We are looking forward to launching more strategic initiatives together with WeTV.""    ""IndiHome TV is a pay TV market leader in Indonesia, and as one of our major OTT partners, WeTV has exceeded our expectations by providing a diverse selection of Asian series and movies, particularly reflected by the success of local original series which are more relevant to the Indonesian audience,"" said  Dedi Suherman, Head of TV Video Division of Telkom Indonesia.  ""We look forward to continuing the partnership of IndiHome TV with WeTV, and we are excited to see more of our subscribers enjoying WeTV.""   2023 Content Line-Up   WeTV is committed to continue investing in prime, local original content and bringing the best of Asian entertainment to its viewers in the region, given the region's growing investment in Internet infrastructure, growing demand for quality content, and rapid digitalisation of film and television content.   Historical drama ""Love Like the Galaxy"" which was released last year, has achieved a new record high in terms of viewership and income among Chinese dramas since 2019.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796916,"Griner return, free agency could spark charter flight change","Brittney Griner's return to the WNBA this summer after being traded in a dramatic prisoner swap in December with Russia has collided with free agency, creating potential travel complications for the league out of safety concerns for her.

            If Griner, who is a free agent but has said she'll return to Phoenix, needs special travel accommodations — such as chartered flights — the league will have to come up with a plan for the 6-foot-9 star. Griner's safety when traveling will be a top priority for her team and the league.

            “We are very cognizant of BG’s unique situation,” WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert told The Associated Press. “We've been planning and we’ve been thinking it through with security experts, BG’s side, our side. We’ll find the right time to comment on it when she signs with a team.”











            That could come Wednesday, when free agents can officially sign.

            While the Griner situation is unique, other marquee players raised the issue of charter flights, which teams have deemed too costly.

            The current collective bargaining agreement requires that all teams fly commercial and doesn’t allow teams to charter flights. Any change in that would have to be approved by both the union and the league.

            “No one wants to make this work more than me,” Engelbert said. “That’s why we’re working so hard to transform the economic business model. We’ve had positive changes over the last couple years, but we're not going to jeopardize the financial viability of the league. We are on the cusp of something big here.”

            HOW MUCH WOULD IT COST THE WNBA TO CHARTER FLIGHTS?

            Engelbert says it would cost the league about $25 million each season for each of its 12 teams to charter flights to every game. That number has increased about $5 million from previous estimates by the commissioner due to the new 40-game WNBA schedule this season, fuel costs and other factors.

            The estimated cost per franchise to charter flights would be approximately $2 million. Air travel expenses currently for each team is about $150,000, according to two people familiar with the costs. The people spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to publicly address the issue.

            “We did it last year for the Finals and we have experience on how much it costs for routes we need to fly,"" Engelbert said. “We are monitoring and updating our analysis. We are going to try and get an economic model to fund this as soon as we can.”

            WHAT HAPPENS IF A TEAM CHARTERS FLIGHTS?

            If teams violate the current CBA, they could be fined.

            The New York Liberty were fined a WNBA record $500,000 in 2021 for chartering flights to away games during the second half of that season.

            HAS THE WNBA CONSIDERED SUBSIDIZING FLIGHTS?

            Breanna Stewart, who announced on social media that she'll play with New York on Wednesday, started a social media campaign to try to help get chartered flights for the league. She tweeted: “I would love to be part of a deal that helps subsidize charter travel for the entire WNBA. I would contribute my NIL, posts + production hrs to ensure we all travel in a way that prioritizes player health + safety, which ultimately results in a better product. Who’s with me?”

            Many current and former WNBA and NBA players offered their support — though any change to travel restrictions would have to be voted on by the union and the league.

            “We would need a commitment to it in perpetuity,” Engelbert said. “That’s 250-300 million dollars. Look at the gate and media deal and sponsorship dollars. We’re not close to being able to afford $250 million over the next decade.”

            Stewart said on Wednesday that she knows it “won't go from zero to 100. Obviously we would love to have a charter company come in and get sponsors for the entire year. If we can be able to pick and choose the flights whether it's the East to West Coast trip or you know the worst back-to-back. ... Right now it's just a no. Maybe it can be a maybe or a yes sometimes. No is really hard to work with.""

            DO WOMEN'S COLLEGE TEAMS CHARTER FLIGHTS?

            WNBA players are used to flying charter flights. That's how they traveled in college.

            Title IX legislation requires universities to have equal opportunities for their men’s and women’s athletic programs. The NCAA flies both the men's and women's teams on charter flights for its marquee college basketball tournament if they are more than 400 miles from the site of their game.

            That legislation doesn't apply to the pros, so NBA teams chartering between cities has no effect on what WNBA teams do.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796917,"US, Philippines agree to larger American military presence","MANILA, Philippines (AP) — The United States and the Philippines on Thursday announced plans to expand America's military presence in the Southeast Asian nation, with access to four more bases as they seek to deter China’s increasingly aggressive actions toward Taiwan and in the disputed South China Sea.

            The agreement was reached as U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was in the country for talks about deploying U.S. forces and weapons in more Philippine military camps. 

            In a joint announcement by the Philippines and the U.S., the two said they had decided to accelerate the full implementation of their so-called Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement, which aims to support combined training, exercises and interoperability.











            As part of the agreement, the U.S. has allocated $82 million toward infrastructure improvements at five current EDCA sites, and expand its military presence to four new sites in “strategic areas of the country,” according to the statement. 

            Austin arrived in the Philippines on Tuesday from South Korea, where he said the U.S. would increase its deployment of advanced weapons such as fighter jets and bombers to the Korean Peninsula to bolster joint training with South Korean forces in response to North Korea’s growing nuclear threat.

            In the Philippines, Washington's oldest treaty ally in Asia and a key front in the U.S. battle against terrorism, Austin visited southern Zamboanga city and met Filipino generals and a small contingent of U.S. counterterrorism forces based in a local military camp, regional Philippine military commander Lt. Gen. Roy Galido said. The more than 100 U.S. military personnel have provided intelligence and combat advice for years to Filipino troops battling a decades-long Muslim insurgency, which has considerably eased but remains a key threat. 

            More recently, U.S. forces have intensified and broadened joint training focusing on combat readiness and disaster response with Filipino troops on the nation’s western coast, which faces the South China Sea, and in its northern Luzon region across the sea from the Taiwan Strait.

            American forces were granted access to five Philippine military camps, where they could rotate indefinitely under the 2014 EDCA defense pact.

            In October, the U.S. sought access for a larger number of its forces and weapons in an additional five military camps, mostly in the north. That request would be high on the agenda in Austin’s meetings, according to Philippine officials.

            “The visit of Secretary Austin definitely, obviously will have to do with many of the ongoing discussions on the EDCA sites,” Philippine Ambassador to Washington Jose Romualdez said at a news briefing. 

            Austin was scheduled to hold talks Thursday with his Philippine counterpart, Carlito Galvez Jr., and National Security Adviser Eduardo Ano, Romualdez said. Austin will separately call on President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who took office in June and has since taken steps to boost relations with Washington.

            The U.S. defense chief is the latest senior official to visit the Philippines after Vice President Kamala Harris in November in a sign of warming ties after a strained period under Marcos’s predecessor, Rodrigo Duterte.

            Duterte had nurtured cozy ties with China and Russia and at one point threatened to sever ties with Washington, kick visiting American forces out and abrogate a major defense pact. 

            Romualdez said the Philippines needed to cooperate with Washington to deter any escalation of tensions between China and self-ruled Taiwan — not only because of the treaty alliance but to help prevent a major conflict.

            “We’re in a Catch-22 situation. If China makes a move on Taiwan militarily, we’ll be affected — and all ASEAN region, but mostly us, Japan and South Korea,” Romualdez told The Associated Press, referring to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the 10-nation regional bloc that includes the Philippines.

            The Philippines and ASEAN members Brunei, Malaysia and Vietnam, along with Taiwan, have been locked in increasingly tense territorial disputes with China in the South China Sea. The U.S. has been regarded as a crucial counterweight to China in the region and has pledged to come to the defense of the Philippines if Filipino forces, ships or aircraft come under attack in the contested waters.

            The Philippines used to host two of the largest U.S. Navy and Air Force bases outside the American mainland. The bases were shut down in the early 1990s after the Philippine Senate rejected an extension, but American forces returned for large-scale combat exercises with Filipino troops under a 1999 Visiting Forces Agreement.

            Gonsolin gets $3.25 million this year and $3.4 million in 2024. 

            His salary in the second season can escalate by up to $3 million based on a points system in which he will be credited one point for each start, or each relief appearance of 3 1/3 innings: $500,000 apiece for 14, 16, 18, 20, 24 and 28 points. The 2024 salary also would increase by $1,125,000 for winning a Cy Young Award this year, $625,000 for finishing second or third in the voting and $500,000 for finishing fourth or fifth.











            The sides exchanged salary proposals on Jan. 13, with Gonsolin seeking a raise from $720,000 last season to $3.4 million this year, while the Dodgers offered $3 million.

            The 28-year-old right-hander was 16-1 with a 2.14 ERA and 119 strikeouts in 24 starts during a breakout season last year. Gonsolin earned his first All-Star selection with an 11-0 record and a 2.02 ERA in the first half. He finished with the highest winning percentage (.941) in franchise history.

            Gonsolin has been with the Dodgers for parts of four seasons since being drafted in the ninth round out of Saint Mary’s College in 2016. He is 26-6 with a 2.51 ERA in 59 career games. 

            He helped the Dodgers win the 2020 World Series during the pandemic-shortened season.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796921,Republicans set to oust Rep. Omar from Foreign Affairs panel,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Newly empowered House Republicans are preparing to oust Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar, a Somali-born Muslim lawmaker, from the House Foreign Affairs Committee over her past comments critical of Israel — and as payback after Democrats booted far-right GOP lawmakers from committees for their incendiary, violent remarks.

            A procedural vote Wednesday showed unified Republican support for moving against Omar, who has apologized for comments that she has said she came to understand were viewed as antisemitic. It was approved on party lines, with all Democrats opposed. A final vote was expected Thursday. 

            House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has been eager to flex Republican power to remove the Minnesota Democrat after he blocked Rep. Adam Schiff and Rep. Eric Swalwell, both California Democrats, from rejoining the House Intelligence Committee once the GOP took control of the chamber in January. While appointments to the Intelligence panel are the prerogative of the speaker, the action on Omar would require a House vote.











            “This is about vengeance. This is about spite. This is about politics,” said Rep. James McGovern of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the House Rules Committee, as Republicans called a hurried meeting late Tuesday to consider the move against Omar.

            McGovern argued that Democrats had removed Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., and Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., from committees for remarks that were far more extreme and violent against fellow lawmakers than those for which Omar had apologized.

            Republicans had been waiting for Democrats to formally nominate Omar to the committee, which she served on during the last Congress. Once the committee roster was approved by the House late Wednesday, Republicans signaled they would move to strip her of the seat.

            “We’ll have enough votes,” McCarthy assured late Wednesday.

            Democrats have little recourse at this point and are planning to formally submit their lineup for a vote. “We are united that she should be seated on the committee,” said Rep. Gregory Meeks of New York, the ranking Democrat on the committee.

            The resolution proposed by Rep. Max Miller, R-Ohio, a former official in the Trump administration, says, “Omar’s comments have brought dishonor to the House of Representatives.""

            Texas Rep. Michael McCaul, the committee chairman, argued against her inclusion on the committee in a recent closed-door meeting with fellow Republicans.

            “It’s just that her worldview of Israel is so diametrically opposed to the committee’s,” McCaul said. “I don’t mind having differences of opinion, but this goes beyond that.” Having her on the committee, he said, “creates dysfunction.”

            Omar said the issues Republicans have cited in opposing her are a pretext to justify their actions. In reality, ""it is about revenge. It’s about appeasing the former president,” Omar said a recent news conference at the Capitol, referring to Donald Trump. 

            Omar said that she, along with Schiff and Swalwell, who were House managers in Trump's impeachment trials, “have been a thorn in the back of the previous, disgraced president.”

            Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said Omar brings a “powerful perspective” to the committee, and she accused Republicans of engaging in a “disgusting form of targeting.”

            McCarthy, R-Calif., has strained to ensure he has enough support from his Republican ranks to oust Omar. Republicans command a slim majority and several GOP lawmakers have been reluctant to engage in tit-for-tat retribution against colleagues. But GOP leaders are moving ahead after several holdouts signaled their support. 

            The drive against Omar comes as embattled Republican Rep. George Santos said he would step aside from his own committee assignments as the House Ethics Committee investigates his actions. The New York Republican has acknowledged embellishments and even lies about his education, work experience and other aspects of his personal and professional life.

            Several Republicans have been wary of taking action against Omar while they are also having to answer for the many questions emerging about Santos. But McCarthy said there's “no correlation,” and said Santos stepping down was about “Santos issues.” 

            Other Republicans skeptical of removing Omar wanted “due process” for lawmakers who face removal. McCarthy said he told them he would work with Democrats on creating a due process system, but acknowledged it's still a work in progress and he's not exactly sure what shape it will take.WASHINGTON (AP) — Newly empowered House Republicans are preparing to oust Democratic Rep.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796922,Abortion foes: 2024 GOP hopefuls must back federal limits,"CHICAGO (AP) — Emboldened anti-abortion activists are looking to the 2024 presidential election as an opportunity to solidify their influence over the Republican Party.

            Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, the most influential group in the anti-abortion movement, is telling each potential GOP presidential hopeful that to win its backing — or avoid being a target of its opposition — they must support national restrictions on the procedure. Exceptions in cases of rape, incest or to save the life of the mother are acceptable, the activists say, but leaving the question for states to decide is not.

            “It is a level of protection that goes to every single state. That’s the baseline of what we’re looking to do,” said Frank Cannon, Susan B. Anthony's chief political strategist. “Anything less than that will not be acceptable and will not be somebody that SBA can support. So, it’s that simple.”











            That directive is creating an early litmus test for Republicans considering entering the first presidential election since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the landmark decision that enshrined federal protections for abortion for roughly 50 years. While the hard-line stance could please anti-abortion activists who hold sway in GOP primaries, it could create problems for the party's eventual nominee in the general election. 

            Voters protected abortion rights via ballot measures in six states in 2022, including Kansas, a state former President Donald Trump twice won by double-digit margins. AP VoteCast, a survey of the midterm electorate, showed the Supreme Court's decision was broadly unpopular. About 6 in 10 said they were angry or dissatisfied by it, and roughly the same percentage said they favor a law guaranteeing access to legal abortion nationwide.

            Supporters of abortion rights say the issue was a “game changer” that helped Democrats last year and that will motivate voters even more in 2024, after two years of seeing the effects of restrictions.

            “We’re in a nation where 18 states have no access to abortion, and that number is not going down. It’s going to go up as additional court cases get decided,” said Jenny Lawson, vice president of organizing and engagement campaigns at Planned Parenthood Action Fund. She predicted people will see headlines “over and over again” about pregnant children forced to travel out of state for abortions or people unable to get proper miscarriage care because doctors are afraid of liability.

            Pressure from the anti-abortion movement has put Trump, who announced his third run for the presidency last year, in perhaps the most complicated position.

            He is arguably more responsible for the overturning of Roe than anyone else, having appointed three anti-abortion Supreme Court justices who backed last year’s ruling. But he has also made clear that he believes pushing any further will hurt Republicans, and he accused anti-abortion leaders of failing to do enough to help GOP candidates in the midterms. 

            “I just didn’t see them fighting during this last election, fighting for victory,” Trump said in an interview with David Brody, a longtime commentator for the Christian Broadcasting Network. 

            Trump, who described himself as “very pro-choice” before entering politics, stressed that objecting to exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother makes it “much harder to win elections.” He has criticized evangelical leaders who have been slow to endorse his latest run, blasting decisions by pastors like Robert Jeffress to wait to assess the rest of the field as “a sign of disloyalty.”

            Cannon called the notion that opposing abortion hurt the GOP last year “absolutely absurd,” pointing to candidates like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis — a top potential GOP presidential candidate — who easily won reelection. DeSantis signed into law last year a ban on abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy. 

            The Republican candidates who got “clobbered,” Cannon said, were those who tried to avoid the topic. 

            “What you have to do is argue for protections that the American people see as reasonable versus the extremism of no exceptions, even late-term abortion,"" Cannon said. ""And if you do that, it’s a winning combination.”

            SBA Pro-Life America, which raised over $60 million for 2020 campaigns along with its affiliated super PAC, is talking with each potential candidate, Cannon said. While records are being discussed, what matters in 2024 is what policies the candidates prioritize when they announce their bids. SBA's specific request is to support “at a minimum” a “heartbeat bill” or “pain-capable” bill, he said.

            The heartbeat bill would make abortion illegal after cardiac activity is detected, which occurs at roughly six weeks of pregnancy — before some women know they're pregnant. Legislation that references the fetus feeling pain, such as a measure introduced last year by Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., would ban the procedure at around 15 weeks. Graham's bill didn't advance in the Democratic-controlled chamber, and even some fellow Republicans distanced themselves from it ahead of the midterms.

            Trump’s stance has provided an opening on the right for potential rivals like former Vice President Mike Pence and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, both of whom are evangelical Christians with long-held anti-abortion stances.

            Pence has spent months visiting so-called crisis pregnancy centers that counsel women against abortions. And he has embarked on a tour of megachurches, including Jeffress’ First Baptist Church in Dallas, and spoken before major anti-abortion groups. 

            His advocacy group, Advancing American Freedom, has pushed for Congress to pass legislation including a national abortion ban beginning around six weeks of pregnancy and a bill that would establish legal personhood at conception. Marc Short, Pence’s former chief of staff and longtime adviser, said that when it comes to declared and potential 2024 candidates, “I see him as the most comfortable explaining his pro-life convictions and the basis for them."" 

            For Pence, he said, the issue is about much more than politics.

            “Mike does it because this is core to the reason that he ran for office and won for the first time. It’s always been for him a top issue and it’s a priority,” he said. 

            Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who was U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under Trump, is another potential candidate who signed abortion prohibitions into law in her state. The 2016 law bans abortion at 20 weeks of pregnancy and includes an exception if the mother's life is in jeopardy but not for cases of rape or incest. 

            After the Supreme Court's decision, Haley said states, and not “unelected justices,” should control abortion policy. That position puts her at odds with SBA and other anti-abortion groups. 

            Others see abortion as a potential vulnerability for DeSantis. A spokesperson for South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, who is also exploring a potential run, recently unloaded on DeSantis, questioning where he stands on the issue.

            “Governor Noem was the only Governor in America on national television defending the Dobbs decision,” Ian Fury wrote in an email to the National Review. “Where was Governor DeSantis? Hiding behind a 15-week ban. Does he believe that 14-week-old babies don’t have a right to live?” 

            Cannon stressed that those in the anti-abortion movement are the “foot soldiers” of the Republican Party during elections and comprise a huge percentage of primary voters.

            “No Republican candidate can win the presidency without the backing of the pro-life movement,"" he said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796934,Impassioned calls for police reform at Tyre Nichols' funeral,"MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) — Tyre Nichols' family and friends remembered him with songs of faith and heartfelt tributes Wednesday, blending a celebration of his life with outraged calls for police reform after the brutal beating he endured at the hands of Memphis police.

            Nichols’ mother, RowVaughn Wells, fought back tears as she spoke lovingly of her son.

            “The only thing that’s keeping me going is that I truly believe that my son was sent here on assignment from God. And I guess now his assignment is done. He’s gone home,” she said, urging Congress to pass police reform.











            The Rev. Al Sharpton and Vice President Kamala Harris both delivered impassioned speeches calling on lawmakers to approve the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, a broad package of reforms that includes a national registry for police officers disciplined for misconduct, a ban on no-knock warrants and other measures.

            Harris said the beating of Nichols, a 29-year-old Black man, by five Black police officers was a violent act that violated the stated mission of police to ensure public safety.

            “It was not in the interest of keeping the public safe, because one must ask, was not it in the interest of keeping the public safe that Tyre Nichols would be with us today? Was he not also entitled to the right to be safe? So when we talk about public safety, let us understand what it means in its truest form. Tyre Nichols should have been safe,” she said.

            Nichols was beaten after police stopped him for an alleged traffic violation Jan. 7. Video released after pressure from Nichols’ family shows officers holding him down and repeatedly punching, kicking and striking him with a baton as he screamed for his mother.

            Sharpton said the officers who beat Nichols might have acted differently if there were real accountability for their actions. He also said he believes that if Nichols had been white, “you wouldn't have beat him like that.”

            “We understand that there are concerns about public safety. We understand that there are needs that deal with crime. But you don’t fight crime by becoming criminals yourself. You don’t stand up to thugs in the street becoming thugs yourself. You don’t fight gangs by becoming five armed men against an unarmed man. That ain’t the police. That’s punks,” he said.

            Family of other Black men and women killed by police — including George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Botham Jean and Eric Garner — also attended the funeral and Nichols’ mother called on officials to prevent more tragedies.

            “We need to take some action because there should be no other child that should suffer the way my son — and all the other parents here have lost their children — we need to get that bill passed,” Wells said. “Because if we don’t, that blood — the next child that dies, that blood is going to be on their hands.” 

            Tiffany Rachal, the mother of Jalen Randle, who was fatally shot by a Houston police officer in 2022, sang a rendition of the classic gospel standard “Total Praise” to rousing applause from the congregation and Nichols’ family.

            “All of the mothers all over the world need to come together, need to come together to stop all of this,"" Rachal said.

            Civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who represents Nichols' family, referred to the graphic video showing the officers punching, kicking and beating Nichols, even after he lay helpless on the ground.

            “Why couldn’t they see the humanity in Tyre?” he asked.

            Tyre's sister, Keyana Dixon, said she felt a pain like she had never experienced before “when those monsters murdered my baby brother."" LaToya Yizar, whose mother was Nichols’ godmother, read from a poem she wrote titled, “I’m Just Trying to Go Home,” invoking Nichols’ words to the officers. 

            Sharpton said he took his daughter Ashley early Wednesday to the site of the former Lorraine Motel, where the Rev. Martin Luther King. Jr. was shot on April 4, 1968. He noted that King was in Memphis to support a strike by city sanitation workers, most of whom were Black.

            “The reason why ... what happened to Tyre is so personal to me, is that five Black men that wouldn’t have had a job in the police department, would not ever be thought of to be in an elite squad, in the city that Dr. King lost his life, not far away from that balcony, you beat a brother to death,” Sharpton said. 

            Nichols, a skateboarder and amateur photographer who worked making boxes at FedEx, grew up in Sacramento, California, and loved the San Francisco 49ers. He came to Memphis just before the coronavirus pandemic and got stuck. But he was fine with it because he was with his mother, and they were incredibly close, she said. He even had her name tattooed on his arm.

            Nichols made friends during morning visits to Starbucks and always greeted his mother and stepfather when he returned home with a sunny, “Hello, parents!” The baby of their family, Nichols had a 4-year-old son and worked hard to better himself as a father, his family said.

            In the three weeks since Nichols' death, five police officers were fired and charged with murder. Their specialized unit was disbanded. Two more officers have been suspended. Two Memphis Fire Department emergency medical workers and a lieutenant were also fired. And more discipline could be coming.

            Attorneys for two of the charged officers, Emmitt Martin III and Desmond Mills Jr., said they will plead not guilty. Blake Ballin, the lawyer for Mills, told AP that the videos “produced as many questions as they have answers.”

            Lawyers for the three other officers have not provided comment to the AP. 

            Nichols’ death was the latest in a string of early accounts by police about their use of force that were later shown to have minimized or omitted mention of violent encounters.

(AP) — Tyre Nichols' family and friends remembered him with songs of faith and heartfelt tributes Wednesday, blending a celebration of his life with outraged calls for police reform after the brutal beating he endured at the hands of Memphis police.Nichols’ mother, RowVaughn Wells, fought back tears as she spoke lovingly of her son.“The only thing that’s keeping me going is that I truly believe that my son was sent here on assignment from God. And I guess now his assignment is done. He’s gone home,” she said, urging Congress to pass police reform.The Rev. Al Sharpton and Vice President Kamala Harris both delivered impassioned speeches calling on lawmakers to approve the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, a broad package of reforms that includes a national registry for police officers disciplined for misconduct, a ban on no-knock warrants and other measures.Harris said the beating of Nichols, a 29-year-old Black man, by five Black police officers was a violent act that violated the stated mission of police to ensure public safety.“It was not in the interest of keeping the public safe, because one must ask, was not it in the interest of keeping the public safe that Tyre Nichols would be with us today? Was he not also entitled to the right to be safe? So when we talk about public safety, let us understand what it means in its truest form. Tyre Nichols should have been safe,” she said.Nichols was beaten after police stopped him for an alleged traffic violation Jan. 7. Video released after pressure from Nichols’ family shows officers holding him down and repeatedly punching, kicking and striking him with a baton as he screamed for his mother.Sharpton said the officers who beat Nichols might have acted differently if there were real accountability for their actions. He also said he believes that if Nichols had been white, “you wouldn't have beat him like that.”“We understand that there are concerns about public safety. We understand that there are needs that deal with crime. But you don’t fight crime by becoming criminals yourself. You don’t stand up to thugs in the street becoming thugs yourself. You don’t fight gangs by becoming five armed men against an unarmed man. That ain’t the police. That’s punks,” he said.Family of other Black men and women killed by police — including George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Botham Jean and Eric Garner — also attended the funeral and Nichols’ mother called on officials to prevent more tragedies.“We need to take some action because there should be no other child that should suffer the way my son — and all the other parents here have lost their children — we need to get that bill passed,” Wells said. “Because if we don’t, that blood — the next child that dies, that blood is going to be on their hands.”Tiffany Rachal, the mother of Jalen Randle, who was fatally shot by a Houston police officer in 2022, sang a rendition of the classic gospel standard “Total Praise” to rousing applause from the congregation and Nichols’ family.“All of the mothers all over the world need to come together, need to come together to stop all of this,"" Rachal said.Civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who represents Nichols' family, referred to the graphic video showing the officers punching, kicking and beating Nichols, even after he lay helpless on the ground.“Why couldn’t they see the humanity in Tyre?” he asked.Tyre's sister, Keyana Dixon, said she felt a pain like she had never experienced before “when those monsters murdered my baby brother.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796935,Asian stocks rise after Fed sees inflation improving,"BEIJING (AP) — Asian stock markets gained Thursday after the Federal Reserve said the U.S. economy is moving toward lower inflation but more interest rate hikes are planned.

            Shanghai, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Sydney advanced. Oil prices rose.

            Wall Street's benchmark S&P 500 index closed 1% higher on Wednesday after the Fed raised its key lending rate by 0.25 percentage points, a smaller margin than previous increases. Chair Jerome Powell said the “disinflationary process has started” but “ongoing increases” in rates will be needed.











            Traders hope lower inflation following repeated rate hikes by global central banks will encourage them to scale down plans for more increases. Some expect a U.S. cut before 2024, though Powell said he anticipates no reductions this year.

            Markets put a “dovish interpretation” on Powell's comments despite his warning that it was too early to declare victory, said Venkateswaran Lavanya of Mizuho Bank in a report.

            The gap between market pricing and Fed plans ""appears to have widened,” Lavanya wrote. “This leaves room for a rude shock down the road.”

            The Shanghai Composite Index gained less than 0.1% to 3,287.29 and the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo added 0.2% to 27,391.85. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong advanced 0.3% to 22,128.78.

            The Kospi in Seoul was 0.6% higher at 2,463.20 and Sydney’s S&P-ASX 200 rose 0.2% to 7,513.80.

            New Zealand and Jakarta advanced while Singapore and Kuala Lumpur declined.

            Following Powell's news conference, the S&P recovered from an early loss to rise to 4,119.21, its highest close since August.

            That appeared to encourage investors who worry the Fed and European central banks might be willing to push the global economy into recession to cool inflation that is near multi-decade highs.

            “We can now say, I think for the first time, that the disinflationary process has started,"" Powell said. He said his “base case” is that the Fed's inflation target of 2% can be achieved “without a really significant downturn or really big increase in unemployment.”

            The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained less than 0.1% to 34,092.96. The Nasdaq composite jumped 2% to 11,816.32.

            Wednesday's announcement raised the Fed's overnight lending rate to a 16-year high of 4.5% to 4.75%, up from close to zero early last year. 

            Data on Wednesday gave a mixed picture of the U.S. job market, a factor in inflation expectations.

            Hiring has stayed resilient despite repeated rate hikes. While that helps workers, it adds to worries that wage gains could add to upward pressure on prices.

            Private payrolls rose by 106,000 in January, according to ADP, a payroll processor. That was a smaller gain than the previous month and below forecasts.

            A separate U.S. government report indicated more strength. It said the number of job openings increased to 11 million in December, better than expected. 

            In energy markets, benchmark U.S. crude rose 66 cents to $77.07 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract fell $2.46 on Wednesday to $76.41. Brent crude, the price basis for international oil trading, added 61 cents to $83.45 per barrel in London. It lost $2.62 the previous session to $82.84 a barrel.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796936,FIFA anxious to reboot Club World Cup after years of delays,"GENEVA (AP) — A little-loved member of FIFA’s family of soccer tournaments for so long, the latest Club World Cup starts Wednesday as a seven-team event two years after that format was due to have been abolished and two years before an ambitious revamp with up to 32 teams.

            FIFA president Gianni Infantino has wanted since being elected to lead soccer's world governing body in 2016 to create a bigger and better version of its only club tournament, an event he once valued at potentially worth $3 billion per edition promising tens of millions in prize money for each team.

            Until a major overhaul — likely in 2025 after the European season — FIFA goes year-to-year with the smaller mid-season version of the intercontinental championship that barely adds to its multi-billion dollar income.











            FIFA will pay $5 million of a $16 million total prize fund to the winner next week, likely to be Real Madrid on a brief, two-game visit to Morocco that could start with a semifinal against the Seattle Sounders. The champion of Europe has won 14 of the 15 titles since 2007.

            The tournament’s shifting place in a congested global soccer calendar was shown by FIFA confirming Morocco as host just six weeks ago.

            That decision was taken in Qatar on the day Infantino targeted 2025 for the first 32-team club event -- “making it really like a World Cup,” he said in Doha.

            The timing surprised some soccer officials in Europe who see FIFA's ambitions in club soccer threatening their domestic leagues and the globally popular, hugely lucrative Champions League. Before going to FIFA, Infantino was the UEFA general secretary overseeing the Champions League and knows exactly the appeal and value of staging top-level clubs. 

            Infantino quickly identified in 2016 two FIFA events for men’s continental champions that had limited appeal nor value, because broadcast and sponsor rights are currently bundled with the World Cup.

            The Confederations Cup for eight national teams stopped in 2017. The Club World Cup has limped on while Infantino has been stymied — by UEFA and the COVID-19 pandemic — in efforts to relaunch it.

            FIFA has said a bigger Club World Cup will “promote and grow football for the benefit of all confederations, member associations, leagues, clubs and fans.”

            In a tumultuous 2018, Infantino’s push to accept a $25 billion offer to create new competitions met UEFA objections to secrecy about the investors who would have an ownership stake. The deal called for a Club World Cup every four years and a follow-up proposal for an annual event also was resisted. 

            One year later in Shanghai, the ruling FIFA Council agreed to a 24-team Club World Cup launching in June 2021 hosted by China. Europe would have eight teams though FIFA wanted 12 to help drive new commercial deals.

            The format was expected to feature eight three-team groups with winners advancing to the quarterfinals. Teams would play at most five games over 18 days in late June, like the Confederations Cup schedule.

            FIFA shelved it in March 2020, taking an inevitable decision when the pandemic forced the European Championship and Copa America to be postponed to start in June 2021.

            Into that void, 12 of Europe’s most storied clubs tried to launch a breakaway Super League project. It failed within days amid a backlash from UEFA, fan groups and lawmakers.

            
                Infantino later acknowledged having talks with some Super League clubs, including Real Madrid and Barcelona, which had backed the earlier $25 billion project. He denied “in any way whatsoever that FIFA was behind or colluding or plotting” for a Super League. 

            When Club World Cup expansion was on hold, the scheduled 2020 edition in Qatar didn't turn out to be the farewell FIFA once intended for the seven-team format. The tournament wasn't played that year because of the pandemic delaying three continental finals, pushing the 2020 Club World Cup into 2021.

            The 2021 edition was played in February 2022 with Abu Dhabi as a short-notice replacement for Japan, which backed out citing expected COVID-related limits on spectators in December.

            The 2022 edition was delayed to start this month because the World Cup in Qatar was on last December, the regular time slot for the Club World Cup since 2005.

            So there could now be two Club World Cups staged in 2023, with a regular December edition in the mix. Maybe a farewell for the seven-team format will have to wait until December 2024.

            FIFA said this week that no decisions have been made.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796937,"NATO chief wants more 'friends' as Russia, China move closer","TOKYO (AP) — China's growing assertiveness and collaboration with Russia pose a challenge not only to Asia but also to Europe, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Wednesday as he sought stronger cooperation and more “friends” for NATO in the Indo-Pacific region.

            Stoltenberg said China is increasingly investing in nuclear weapons and long-range missiles without providing transparency or engaging in meaningful dialogue on arms control for atomic weapons, while escalating coercion of its neighbors and threats against Taiwan, the self-ruled island it claims as its own territory.

            “The fact that Russia and China are coming closer and the significant investments by China and new advanced military capabilities just underlines that China poses a threat, poses a challenge also to NATO allies,” Stoltenberg told an audience at Keio University in Tokyo. “Security is not regional but global.""











            “NATO needs to make sure we have friends,” he said. “It is important to work more closely with our partners in the Indo-Pacific.”

            China is increasingly working with Russia and they lead an “authoritarian pushback” against the rules-based, open and democratic international order, he said.

            Stoltenberg said NATO does not regard China as an adversary or seek confrontation, and that the alliance will continue to engage with China in areas of common interest, such as climate change.

            Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning defended China as “a force for regional and global peace and stability” and criticized NATO for labeling China a threat and for expanding its military ties to Asia.

            “NATO has constantly sought to reach beyond its traditional defense zone and scope, strengthen military and security ties with Asia Pacific countries and played up China’s threats,” Mao said. “I would like to stress that the Asia-Pacific is not a battlefield for the geopolitical contest and does not welcome the Cold War mentality and bloc confrontation.”

            Stoltenberg and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida held talks Tuesday and agreed to step up their partnership in security in cyberspace, space, defense and other areas.

            Besides Japan, NATO is also strengthening “practical cooperation” with Australia, New Zealand and South Korea in maritime cybersecurity and other areas and stepping up participation of their leaders and ministers in NATO meetings, he said. 

            Kishida on Tuesday announced Japan’s plans to open a representative office at NATO. 

            Japan, already a close ally of the United States, has in recent years expanded its military ties with other Indo-Pacific nations as well as with Britain, Europe and NATO amid growing security threats from China and North Korea.

            Tokyo was quick to join in U.S.-led economic sanctions against Russia’s war in Ukraine and provided humanitarian aid and non-combative defense equipment for Ukrainians. Japan fears that Russian aggression in Europe could be reflected in Asia, where concerns are growing over increasing Chinese assertiveness and escalating tensions over its claim to Taiwan.

            Stoltenberg arrived in Japan late Monday from South Korea, where he called for Seoul to provide direct military support to Ukraine to help it fight off the prolonged Russian invasion. 

            North Korea condemned Stoltenberg’s visits to South Korea and Japan, saying that NATO was trying to put its “military boots in the region” to pressure America’s Asian allies into providing weapons to Ukraine.

            North Korea also criticized increasing cooperation between NATO and U.S. allies in Asia as a process to create an “Asian version of NATO,” saying it would raise tensions in the region.

            AP video producer Liu Zheng in Beijing contributed to this report.TOKYO (AP) — China's growing assertiveness and collaboration with Russia pose a challenge not only to Asia but also to Europe, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Wednesday as he sought stronger cooperation and more “friends” for NATO in the Indo-Pacific region.Stoltenberg said China is increasingly investing in nuclear weapons and long-range missiles without providing transparency or engaging in meaningful dialogue on arms control for atomic weapons, while escalating coercion of its neighbors and threats against Taiwan, the self-ruled island it claims as its own territory.“The fact that Russia and China are coming closer and the significant investments by China and new advanced military capabilities just underlines that China poses a threat, poses a challenge also to NATO allies,” Stoltenberg told an audience at Keio University in Tokyo. “Security is not regional but global.""“NATO needs to make sure we have friends,” he said. “It is important to work more closely with our partners in the Indo-Pacific.”China is increasingly working with Russia and they lead an “authoritarian pushback” against the rules-based, open and democratic international order, he said.Stoltenberg said NATO does not regard China as an adversary or seek confrontation, and that the alliance will continue to engage with China in areas of common interest, such as climate change.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning defended China as “a force for regional and global peace and stability” and criticized NATO for labeling China a threat and for expanding its military ties to Asia.“NATO has constantly sought to reach beyond its traditional defense zone and scope, strengthen military and security ties with Asia Pacific countries and played up China’s threats,” Mao said. “I would like to stress that the Asia-Pacific is not a battlefield for the geopolitical contest and does not welcome the Cold War mentality and bloc confrontation.”Stoltenberg and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida held talks Tuesday and agreed to step up their partnership in security in cyberspace, space, defense and other areas.Besides Japan, NATO is also strengthening “practical cooperation” with Australia, New Zealand and South Korea in maritime cybersecurity and other areas and stepping up participation of their leaders and ministers in NATO meetings, he said.Kishida on Tuesday announced Japan’s plans to open a representative office at NATO.Japan, already a close ally of the United States, has in recent years expanded its military ties with other Indo-Pacific nations as well as with Britain, Europe and NATO amid growing security threats from China and North Korea.Tokyo was quick to join in U.S.-led economic sanctions against Russia’s war in Ukraine and provided humanitarian aid and non-combative defense equipment for Ukrainians. Japan fears that Russian aggression in Europe could be reflected in Asia, where concerns are growing over increasing Chinese assertiveness and escalating tensions over its claim to Taiwan.Stoltenberg arrived in Japan late Monday from South Korea, where he called for Seoul to provide direct military support to Ukraine to help it fight off the prolonged Russian invasion.North Korea condemned Stoltenberg’s visits to South Korea and Japan, saying that NATO was trying to put its “military boots in the region” to pressure America’s Asian allies into providing weapons to Ukraine.North Korea also criticized increasing cooperation between NATO and U.S. allies in Asia as a process to create an “Asian version of NATO,” saying it would raise tensions in the region.___AP video producer Liu Zheng in Beijing contributed to this report.",2023/02/02,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796938,"Murray, Jokic help Nuggets hold off Pelicans 122-113","DENVER (AP) — Jamal Murray is locked in right now — with his shot, with his swagger and especially with his confidence in his team.

            “It’s fun to play basketball,"" the Denver point guard said. “But we still have room to improve. We’re not satisfied with where we’re at.”

            Murray scored 32 points, Nikola Jokic got his 16th triple-double of the season and the Western Conference-leading Nuggets held off the reeling New Orleans Pelicans 122-113 on Tuesday night. 











            Murray made a season-high seven 3-pointers to give him 771 for his career and move him past J.R. Smith for second place on the franchise list. He's just 33 away from matching Will Barton for the top spot.

            “I'll get that in three games,” cracked Murray.

            See, swagger. 

            His smooth jumper was so in rhythm early in the game Tuesday that Nuggets coach Michael Malone didn't want to take him out. Malone didn't, either, until later than usual.

            “I don’t want to be the guy that puts the fire out,” said Malone, whose team trailed by 12 in the second quarter before closing the gap to 60-57 at halftime and taking control in the third. “Jamal was really, really good in all areas of the game tonight.”

            Ditto for Jokic, who finished with 26 points, 18 rebounds and 15 assists as the Nuggets improved to 16-0 when he has a triple-double. 

            “I’m happy as long as we are winning games and the players are happy around me,” Jokic said.

            CJ McCollum and Herbert Jones both scored 21 points for the Pelicans, who have dropped nine straight games. They finished 3-13 in January.

            Part of the reason for the slide has been the absence of standout Zion Williamson, who has missed 15 games in a row with a hamstring injury.

            “We’ve got to keep our heads down and keep working,” coach Willie Green said. “It’s hard to win in the NBA. We’re seeing that. There was some beauty in what I saw tonight. ... We’re right there, but we have to sustain it for 48 minutes.”

            The Nuggets led by 13 early in the fourth quarter only to see the Pelicans cut it to five on several occasions, including a layup by Jones with less than a minute remaining. Murray and Jokic each converted a pair of free throws down the stretch to help Denver fend off New Orleans and move to 23-4 at home. 

            Jokic, who’s been dealing with tightness in his left hamstring, had another efficient shooting performance in going 10 of 14 from the floor. It was the 92nd triple-double of his career. 

            “He was pretty dominant across the board,” Green said.

            TIP-INS

            Pelicans: Williamson is steadily progressing from a strained hamstring, according to Green. “It’s something we don’t want to rush, but we’re definitely excited to see him on the floor,"" he said. ... Brandon Ingram finished with 16 points and nine assists. ... Larry Nance Jr. scored 11 of his 13 points in the fourth quarter. 

            Nuggets: Rookie guard Collin Gillespie (broken right leg) has been cleared for shooting and light running. “We’re not putting any pressure or a rush on him,” Malone said. ... Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Aaron Gordon each had 15 points. 

            TRADE TALK

            Nuggets guard Bones Hyland was limited to 4:43 and scored two points. His name has been mentioned in trade speculation. 

            Asked where he stands with Hyland, Malone responded: “I stand with Bones. Bones is on our team.” 

            RISING STARS

            Hyland was selected to the NBA’s Jordan Rising Stars Challenge. So were Pelicans guard Jose Alvarado and forward Trey Murphy III. The mini-tournament will take place on Feb. 17 in Salt Lake City as part of All-Star weekend.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796970,Palestinians face removal as far-right Israel vows expansion,"KHAN AL-AHMAR, West Bank (AP) — Protesters streaming up the windswept hills east of Jerusalem interrupted Maha Ali’s breakfast.

            Palestinian chants of support for her West Bank Bedouin community of Khan al-Ahmar, at risk of demolition by the Israeli army since it lost its legal protection over four years ago, drowned out the singing birds and bleating sheep.

            While intended to encourage the village, last week's solidarity rally unsettled Ali. Israeli politicians assembled on the opposite hill for a counter protest, calling for Khan al-Ahmar's immediate evacuation.











            “Why are they all back here now? Did something happen?” Ali asked her sister, gazing toward a swarm of TV journalists. “Four years of quiet and now this chaos again.”

            The long-running dispute over Khan al-Ahmar has resurfaced as a focus of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with a legal deadline looming and Israel’s new far-right ministers pushing the government to fulfill a Supreme Court-sanctioned commitment from 2018 to wipe the village off the map. Israel contends that the hamlet, home to nearly 200 Palestinians and an EU-funded school, was built illegally on state land.

            For Palestinians, Khan al-Ahmar is emblematic of the latest stage of the decades-long conflict, as thousands of Palestinians struggle for Israeli permission to build in the 60% of the occupied West Bank over which the Israeli military has full control.

            After a spasm of violence last week — including the deadliest Israeli raid in the West Bank for two decades and the deadliest Palestinian attack on civilians in Jerusalem since 2008 — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded Saturday with a vow to strengthen Jewish settlements in the Israeli-controlled part of the West Bank, where little land is allocated to Palestinians.

            The competition for land is playing out in the southern Hebron hills — where the Supreme Court has ordered the expulsion of a thousand Palestinians in an area known as Masafer Yatta — and across the territory. In unauthorized Palestinian villages — without direct access to Israeli power, water or sewage infrastructure — residents watch helplessly as Israeli authorities demolish homes, issue evacuation orders and expand settlements, changing the landscape of territory they dream of calling their state.

            Last year, Israeli authorities razed 784 Palestinian buildings in the West Bank because they lacked permits, Israeli rights group B’Tselem reported, the most since it started tracking those demolitions a decade ago. The army tears down homes gradually, the group says, loathe to risk the global censure that would come from leveling a whole village.

            News of Khan al-Ahmar's impending mass eviction four years ago sparked widespread backlash. Since then, the government has stalled, asking the court for more time due to international pressure and Israel's repeatedly deadlocked elections.

            “They say the bulldozers will come tomorrow, next month, next year,” said Ali, 40, from her metal-topped shed, where she can see the red-roofed homes of the fast-growing Kfar Adumim settlement. “Our life is frozen.”

            On Wednesday, the Israeli government requested another four months to respond to a Supreme Court petition by a pro-settler group, Regavim, asking why Khan al-Ahmar has not yet been razed. Far right lawmakers condemned the delay on Wednesday, with Danny Danon, a member of Netanyahu’s Likud party, demanding that the new Cabinet change the “floundering policies of the previous government.” 

            The Bedouins fear the brakes may be off now that Israel has its most right-wing government in history.

            Regavim's co-founder, Bezalel Smotrich, is now Israel's ultra-nationalist finance minister. In a contentious coalition deal, he was given control over an Israeli military body that oversees construction and demolition in Israeli-administered parts of the West Bank.

            At a Cabinet meeting last week, Israel’s national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, demanded that Khan al-Ahmar be demolished “just as the defense minister chose to destroy a Jewish outpost"" built illegally in the West Bank. 

            “It's not just about Khan al-Ahmar, it's about the future of Judea and Samaria,” Yuli Edelstein, chairman of the parliament’s foreign and defense committee said during a visit to the village last week, using the biblical names for the West Bank.

            Khan al-Ahmar’s leader, 56-year-old Eid Abu Khamis, said anxiety has returned to his cluster of shacks. ""They want to empty the land and give to settlers,"" he said.

            Bedouins have made Khan al-Ahmar their home since at least the 1970s, though some, like Ali and Abu Khamis, say their parents lived there earlier. Israel has offered to resettle the villagers at another site several miles away. Palestinians fear Israel will use the strategic strip of land to slice Jerusalem off from Palestinian cities, making a future Palestinian state non-viable.

            “We are trying to counter this in every way we can,” said Ahmad Majdalani, the Palestinian Authority’s minister of social development. “The new government will find itself in direct confrontation with us and the international community.”

            During a visit by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken to Jerusalem and Ramallah on Tuesday, he expressed Washington's opposition to Israeli demolitions and evictions — actions which, he said, put a two-state solution to the conflict “further from reach.""

            The U.S. government has raised concerns about planned evictions of Palestinians in the West Bank with the Israeli government, said the U.S. Office of Palestinian Affairs, referring to the cases of Khan al-Ahmar and Masafer Yatta in what is known as Area C. 

            The zone covers 60% of the West Bank designated as being under full Israeli control. This is in contrast to the remaining areas, including Palestinian population centers, where the Palestinian autonomy government exercises civil and partial security control.

            This demarcation of different zones was part of the 1995 Oslo peace accords. 

            
                It was an interim agreement, meant to last five years pending a final peace deal.

            “The intention was always that the lion’s share of Area C will be part of the Palestinian state,” said Yossi Beilin, an architect of those peace accords. “Otherwise, it’s like holding people in a prison, and eventually, there would be an explosion.”

            Nearly three decades later, Area C is home to some half-million Israelis in dozens of settlements considered illegal under international law. They live alongside between 180,000-300,000 Palestinians, the U.N. estimates, who are almost never granted permits to build. When they build homes without permits, military bulldozers level them. 

            Netanyahu’s coalition partners have a radically different vision for Area C than the one drawn up in Oslo. They hope to boost the settler population, eliminate Palestinian construction and even annex the territory. The Cabinet announced a freeze on Palestinian building there as part of punitive measures against the PA last month.

            Last May, Israel’s Supreme Court approved the expulsion of some 1,000 Palestinians in Masafer Yatta, south of Hebron, because the Israeli army declared it a restricted firing zone in the early 1980s. There and in surrounding encampments, Palestinians describe an Israeli campaign to make life so miserable they're compelled to leave.

            Last Wednesday, Luqba Jabari, 65, awoke to the rumble of bulldozers in Khirbet Ma’in, part of the Masafer Yatta area, where her grandparents were born. She and her 30 relatives rushed outside to watch the army reduce their home to rubble. The military toppled her family's three other shacks and water tanks. 

            That night, she said, they would sleep in their cars, beside the debris of their family's life together. For the past week, their neighbors have offered some spare rooms as a temporary refuge.

            “This is our land,” Jabari said. “There is no place to go.""KHAN AL-AHMAR, West Bank (AP) — Protesters streaming up the windswept hills east of Jerusalem interrupted Maha Ali’s breakfast.Palestinian chants of support for her West Bank Bedouin community of Khan al-Ahmar, at risk of demolition by the Israeli army since it lost its legal protection over four years ago, drowned out the singing birds and bleating sheep.While intended to encourage the village, last week's solidarity rally unsettled Ali. Israeli politicians assembled on the opposite hill for a counter protest, calling for Khan al-Ahmar's immediate evacuation.“Why are they all back here now? Did something happen?” Ali asked her sister, gazing toward a swarm of TV journalists. “Four years of quiet and now this chaos again.”The long-running dispute over Khan al-Ahmar has resurfaced as a focus of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with a legal deadline looming and Israel’s new far-right ministers pushing the government to fulfill a Supreme Court-sanctioned commitment from 2018 to wipe the village off the map. Israel contends that the hamlet, home to nearly 200 Palestinians and an EU-funded school, was built illegally on state land.For Palestinians, Khan al-Ahmar is emblematic of the latest stage of the decades-long conflict, as thousands of Palestinians struggle for Israeli permission to build in the 60% of the occupied West Bank over which the Israeli military has full control.After a spasm of violence last week — including the deadliest Israeli raid in the West Bank for two decades and the deadliest Palestinian attack on civilians in Jerusalem since 2008 — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded Saturday with a vow to strengthen Jewish settlements in the Israeli-controlled part of the West Bank, where little land is allocated to Palestinians.The competition for land is playing out in the southern Hebron hills — where the Supreme Court has ordered the expulsion of a thousand Palestinians in an area known as Masafer Yatta — and across the territory. In unauthorized Palestinian villages — without direct access to Israeli power, water or sewage infrastructure — residents watch helplessly as Israeli authorities demolish homes, issue evacuation orders and expand settlements, changing the landscape of territory they dream of calling their state.Last year, Israeli authorities razed 784 Palestinian buildings in the West Bank because they lacked permits, Israeli rights group B’Tselem reported, the most since it started tracking those demolitions a decade ago. The army tears down homes gradually, the group says, loathe to risk the global censure that would come from leveling a whole village.News of Khan al-Ahmar's impending mass eviction four years ago sparked widespread backlash. Since then, the government has stalled, asking the court for more time due to international pressure and Israel's repeatedly deadlocked elections.“They say the bulldozers will come tomorrow, next month, next year,” said Ali, 40, from her metal-topped shed, where she can see the red-roofed homes of the fast-growing Kfar Adumim settlement. “Our life is frozen.”On Wednesday, the Israeli government requested another four months to respond to a Supreme Court petition by a pro-settler group, Regavim, asking why Khan al-Ahmar has not yet been razed. Far right lawmakers condemned the delay on Wednesday, with Danny Danon, a member of Netanyahu’s Likud party, demanding that the new Cabinet change the “floundering policies of the previous government.”The Bedouins fear the brakes may be off now that Israel has its most right-wing government in history.Regavim's co-founder, Bezalel Smotrich, is now Israel's ultra-nationalist finance minister. In a contentious coalition deal, he was given control over an Israeli military body that oversees construction and demolition in Israeli-administered parts of the West Bank.At a Cabinet meeting last week, Israel’s national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, demanded that Khan al-Ahmar be demolished “just as the defense minister chose to destroy a Jewish outpost"" built illegally in the West Bank.“It's not just about Khan al-Ahmar, it's about the future of Judea and Samaria,” Yuli Edelstein, chairman of the parliament’s foreign and defense committee said during a visit to the village last week, using the biblical names for the West Bank.Khan al-Ahmar’s leader, 56-year-old Eid Abu Khamis, said anxiety has returned to his cluster of shacks. ""They want to empty the land and give to settlers,"" he said.Bedouins have made Khan al-Ahmar their home since at least the 1970s, though some, like Ali and Abu Khamis, say their parents lived there earlier. Israel has offered to resettle the villagers at another site several miles away. Palestinians fear Israel will use the strategic strip of land to slice Jerusalem off from Palestinian cities, making a future Palestinian state non-viable.“We are trying to counter this in every way we can,” said Ahmad Majdalani, the Palestinian Authority’s minister of social development. “The new government will find itself in direct confrontation with us and the international community.”During a visit by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken to Jerusalem and Ramallah on Tuesday, he expressed Washington's opposition to Israeli demolitions and evictions — actions which, he said, put a two-state solution to the conflict “further from reach.""The U.S. government has raised concerns about planned evictions of Palestinians in the West Bank with the Israeli government, said the U.S. Office of Palestinian Affairs, referring to the cases of Khan al-Ahmar and Masafer Yatta in what is known as Area C.The zone covers 60% of the West Bank designated as being under full Israeli control. This is in contrast to the remaining areas, including Palestinian population centers, where the Palestinian autonomy government exercises civil and partial security control.This demarcation of different zones was part of the 1995 Oslo peace accords.It was an interim agreement, meant to last five years pending a final peace deal.“The intention was always that the lion’s share of Area C will be part of the Palestinian state,” said Yossi Beilin, an architect of those peace accords. “Otherwise, it’s like holding people in a prison, and eventually, there would be an explosion.”Nearly three decades later, Area C is home to some half-million Israelis in dozens of settlements considered illegal under international law. They live alongside between 180,000-300,000 Palestinians, the U.N. estimates, who are almost never granted permits to build. When they build homes without permits, military bulldozers level them.Netanyahu’s coalition partners have a radically different vision for Area C than the one drawn up in Oslo. They hope to boost the settler population, eliminate Palestinian construction and even annex the territory. The Cabinet announced a freeze on Palestinian building there as part of punitive measures against the PA last month.Last May, Israel’s Supreme Court approved the expulsion of some 1,000 Palestinians in Masafer Yatta, south of Hebron, because the Israeli army declared it a restricted firing zone in the early 1980s. There and in surrounding encampments, Palestinians describe an Israeli campaign to make life so miserable they're compelled to leave.Last Wednesday, Luqba Jabari, 65, awoke to the rumble of bulldozers in Khirbet Ma’in, part of the Masafer Yatta area, where her grandparents were born. She and her 30 relatives rushed outside to watch the army reduce their home to rubble. The military toppled her family's three other shacks and water tanks.That night, she said, they would sleep in their cars, beside the debris of their family's life together. For the past week, their neighbors have offered some spare rooms as a temporary refuge.“This is our land,” Jabari said. “There is no place to go.""",2023/02/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796971,Alec Baldwin scheduled for court on charges in set death,"SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) — Alec Baldwin’s first court appearance has been set as he confronts accusations of firearm safety failures and involuntary manslaughter in the fatal shooting of a cinematographer on a New Mexico film set.

            A New Mexico court on Wednesday scheduled Baldwin and film-set weapons supervisor Hannah Gutierrez-Reed to appear by videoconference before Santa Fe-based District Court Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer in late February, leaving several weeks before the defendants may provide a formal response to felony charges. They were both charged Tuesday with involuntary manslaughter in the death of Halyna Hutchins on the set of the Western movie “Rust.”

            
                Hutchins died shortly after being wounded during rehearsals at a ranch on the outskirts of Santa Fe on Oct. 21, 2021. Baldwin was pointing a pistol at Hutchins when the gun went off, killing her and wounding the director, Joel Souza.











            A manslaughter charge can be brought if a defendant killed while doing something lawful but dangerous and was acting negligently or without caution.

            In newly filed court documents, prosecutors said reckless safety failures accompanied the film production from the outset. They cite Baldwin's failure as an actor to appear for mandatory firearms training prior to filming and his decision as a producer to work with Gutierrez-Reed, who was an uncertified and inexperienced armorer.

            A probable cause statement from investigators traces safety failures across a 10-day period, such as misfires on set, a camera crew walkout and the moments before Hutchins' death as a revolver was loaded with ammunition and Baldwin's finger came to rest on the pistol's trigger.

            “Baldwin's deviation from known standards, practices and protocol directly caused"" Hutchins' death, Robert Shilling, a special investigator for the Santa Fe district attorney’s office, said in the probable cause statement.

            Baldwin’s attorney Luke Nikas declined to comment Tuesday and referred to a previous statement in which he called the charges a “terrible miscarriage of justice” that he and his client would fight and win.

            “Mr. Baldwin had no reason to believe there was a live bullet in the gun – or anywhere on the movie set,” the statement said. “He relied on the professionals with whom he worked.”

            Gutierrez-Reed’s attorney said they would release a statement later.

            Santa Fe District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies told The Associated Press in a Jan. 19 interview that the set was “really being run pretty fast and loose” and Baldwin should have known there were previous misfires on the set and people had brought up safety concerns. She also highlighted Baldwin as the person ""that held the gun, that pointed the gun and that pulled the trigger.”

            Prosecutors will forgo a grand jury and rely on a judge to determine if there is sufficient evidence to move toward trial. That decision could take up to 60 days and involve trail-like hearings to consider witness testimony and evidence. 

            Prosecutors have submitted a list of dozens of witnesses including the wounded “Rust” director Souza, weapons assistant Sarah Zachry, the film's ammunition provider, several participants in the filmset rehearsal where Hutchins was shot — as well as FBI analysts, law enforcement detectives and sheriff's deputies who initially responded to the shooting.

            The manslaughter charges against Baldwin and Gutierrez-Reed include two alternative standards and sanctions.

            One version would require proof of negligence, which is punishable by up to 18 months in jail and a $5,000 fine under New Mexico law.

            The second alternative is reckless disregard of safety “without due caution and circumspection.” It carries a higher threshold of wrongdoing and includes a “firearm enhancement” that could result in a mandatory five years in prison because the offense was committed with a gun.

            A jury may decide which definition of manslaughter to pursue, prosecutors said.

            Defense litigator Kate Mangels, whose work includes the entertainment sector, said prosecutors submitted a robust analysis of Baldwin's safety responsibilities as actor and producer on “Rust.”

            “The fact that they separated out Alec Baldwin the actor versus Alec Baldwin the producer shows to me that they're potentially foreseeing a challenge to his culpability as to either of those roles,” said Mangles, who is based in Santa Monica, California. “So they want to differentiate ... and provide a robust analysis of both of those separately.”

            Investigators said reckless safety failures culminated when Baldwin drew a revolver from a holster, pointed it at Hutchins and fired the weapon when a plastic or replica gun should have been used by industry standards. 

            Photos and videos of the rehearsal, including moments before the deadly shooting, showed Baldwin with his finger inside the trigger guard and on the trigger while “manipulating” the pistol’s hammer, investigators said, noting that an FBI analysis shows the pistol could not be fired without pressing the trigger.

            Baldwin, who has described the killing as a tragic accident, said he was told the .45-caliber revolver was safe. The 64-year-old actor has sought to clear his name by suing people involved in handling and supplying the loaded gun.

            Baldwin said in his lawsuit that, while working on camera angles with Hutchins, he pointed the gun in her direction and pulled back and released the hammer of the weapon, which discharged.

            Defense attorney Jason Bowles, who represents Gutierrez-Reed, said the charges are the result of a “flawed investigation” and an “inaccurate understanding of the full facts.”

            The decision to charge Baldwin marks a stunning turn of events for an A-list actor whose 40-year career included the early blockbuster “The Hunt for Red October” and a starring role in the sitcom “30 Rock,” as well as iconic appearances in Martin Scorsese’s “The Departed” and a film adaptation of David Mamet’s “Glengary Glen Ross.” In recent years, Baldwin was known for his impression of former President Donald Trump on “Saturday Night Live.”

            Prosecutors said a proposed plea agreement signed by assistant director David Halls, who oversaw safety on set, has not yet been approved by a judge and cannot be published. 

            Halls also is scheduled for a first-appearance in New Mexico court later this month. He has agreed to plead guilty in the negligent use of a deadly weapon, explaining that he may have handled the gun improperly before it was given to Baldwin, prosecutors said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796972,Taiwan activates defenses in response to China incursions,"TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — Taiwan scrambled fighter jets, put its navy on alert and activated missile systems in response to nearby operations by 34 Chinese military aircraft and nine warships that are part Beijing's strategy to unsettle and intimidate the self-governing island democracy. 

            The large-scale Chinese deployment came as Beijing increases preparations for a potential blockade or military action against Taiwan that have stirred increasing concern among military leaders, diplomats and elected officials in the U.S., Taiwan's key ally. 

            In a memo last month, U.S. Air Force Gen. Mike Minihan instructed officers to be prepared for a U.S. -China conflict over Taiwan in 2025. As head of the Air Mobility Command, Minihan has a keen understanding of the Chinese military and his personal remarks echo calls in the U.S. for heightened preparations. 











            Taiwan's Defense Ministry said 20 Chinese aircraft on Tuesday crossed the central line in the Taiwan Strait that has long been an unofficial buffer zone between the sides, which separated during a civil war in 1949.

            
                China claims the island republic as its own territory, to be taken by force if necessary, while the vast majority of Taiwanese are opposed to coming under the control of China’s authoritarian Communist Party. 

            Taiwan’s armed forces “monitored the situation ... to respond to these activities,” the Defense Ministry said Wednesday. 

            That announcement came as NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg warned that China’s growing assertiveness and collaboration with Russia pose a threat not only to Asia but also to Europe.

            On a visit to Japan on Wednesday, Stoltenberg said China is increasingly investing in nuclear weapons and long-range missiles without providing transparency or engaging in arms control talks. Stoltenberg earlier criticized China for “bullying its neighbors and threatening Taiwan” and stressed the need for Japan and other democracies to work together with the alliance to defend the international order.

            “NATO needs to make sure we have friends,” he said, citing escalating Chinese attempts to coerce neighbors and threaten Taiwan. “It is important to work more closely with our partners in the Indo Pacific.” 

            China’s Foreign Ministry responded by accusing NATO of exceeding its mandate and having “played up China’s threats.”

            “China is always a force for regional and global peace and stability,” ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a regular briefing. 

            “I would like to stress that the Asia-Pacific is not a battlefield for the geopolitical contest and does not welcome the Cold War mentality and bloc confrontation,” Mao said. 

            It wasn't clear what prompted the Chinese action in Taiwan, although it came just ahead of a visit to Beijing by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who would become the highest-ranking official to visit China since President Joe Biden's election in 2020. 

            Beijing frequently seeks to flag Taiwan as the most serious issue in U.S.-China relations ahead of top-level discussions, leading then to discussions of other economic, trade and political issues where there is more room for meaningful exchanges. 

            
                China has sent warships, bombers, fighter jets and support aircraft into airspace near Taiwan on a near-daily basis, hoping to wear down the island's limited defense resources and undercut support for pro-independence President Tsai Ing-wen. 

            Chinese fighter jets have also confronted military aircraft from the U.S. and allied nations over international airspace in the South China and East China seas, in what Beijing has described as dangerous and threatening maneuvers. 

            
                A string of visits in recent months by foreign politicians to Taiwan, including by then-U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and numerous politicians from the European Union, spurred displays of military might from both sides.

            In response to Pelosi's visit in August, China staged war games surrounding the island and fired missiles over it into the Pacific Ocean. 

            China has repeatedly threatened retaliation against countries seeking closer ties with Taiwan, but its attempts at intimidation have sparked a backlash in popular sentiment in Europe, Japan, the U.S. and other nations. 

            Taiwan is set to hold presidential elections next year, in contrast to China's system of total control by President and party General Secretary Xi Jinping, who has removed term limits to effectively make him leader for life. China's efforts to reach out to Taiwan's pro-unification Nationalist Party have largely backfired. 

            Although the Nationalists performed well in local elections last year, the party's pro-Beijing policies have failed to find resonance among voters on a national level. 

            Taiwan has responded to China's threats by ordering more defensive weaponry from the U.S., leveraging its democracy and high-tech economy to strengthen foreign relations and revitalizing its domestic arms industry. 

            Compulsory military service for men is being extended from four months to one year and public opinion surveys show high levels of support for increased defense spending to counter China's threats. 

            
                In an interview last month, Taiwan's envoy to the U.S. said the island has learned important lessons from Russia's war in Ukraine that would help it deter any attack by China or defend itself if invaded.

            Taiwan's de facto ambassador in Washington, Bi-khim Hsiao, said there is a new emphasis on preparing military reservists and civilians for the kind of all-of-society fight that Ukrainians are waging against Russia.

            “Everything we’re doing now is to prevent the pain and suffering of the tragedy of Ukraine from being repeated in our scenario in Taiwan,” Hsiao told The Associated Press. “So ultimately, we seek to deter the use of military force. But in a worst-case scenario, we understand that we have to be better prepared.”TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — Taiwan scrambled fighter jets, put its navy on alert and activated missile systems in response to nearby operations by 34 Chinese military aircraft and nine warships that are part Beijing's strategy to unsettle and intimidate the self-governing island democracy.The large-scale Chinese deployment came as Beijing increases preparations for a potential blockade or military action against Taiwan that have stirred increasing concern among military leaders, diplomats and elected officials in the U.S., Taiwan's key ally.In a memo last month, U.S. Air Force Gen.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796973,Connecticut may exonerate accused witches centuries later,"HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — Decades before the infamous Salem witch trials in Massachusetts, Alse Young was killed at the gallows in Connecticut, becoming the first person on record to be executed in the American colonies for witchcraft.

            The Windsor town clerk registered the death on May 26, 1647, in a diary entry that read: “Alse Young was hanged.” Young was the first of nine women and two men executed by the colony of Connecticut for witchcraft over 15 years, a period during which more than 40 people faced trial for having ties to Satan. 

            Now, more than 375 years later, amateur historians, researchers and descendants of the accused witches and their accusers hope Connecticut lawmakers will finally offer posthumous exonerations. 











            While such requests aren’t new, they have become louder as many genealogy buffs discover they have distant relatives involved in the lesser-known Connecticut witch trials.

            “They’re talking about how this has followed their families from generation to generation and that they would love for someone just to say, ‘Hey, this was wrong,’” said Connecticut state Rep. Jane Garibay, who proposed an exoneration resolution after receiving letters from eighth- and ninth-generation relatives of accused witches. “And to me, that’s an easy thing to do if it gives people peace.” 

            Other states and countries have attempted to atone for a history of persecuting people as witches. Last year, Scotland’s prime minister issued a formal apology to the estimated 4,000 Scots, mostly women, who were accused of witchcraft up until 1736. Of the 4,000, about 2,500 were killed. A Scottish member of parliament last year called for posthumously pardoning them.

            In 2022, Massachusetts lawmakers formally exonerated Elizabeth Johnson Jr., who was convicted of witchcraft in 1693 and sentenced to death at the height of the Salem Witch Trials. Johnson is believed to be the last accused Salem witch to have her conviction set aside by legislators.

            In 2006, former Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine gave an informal pardon to Grace Sherwood, a widowed midwife who was blamed by neighbors for ruining crops, killing livestock and creating storms and subsequently accused of being a witch. With her hands bound, Sherwood was thrown into a river to see if she floated, which was purported to indicate guilt. She managed to set herself free and spent seven years in prison.

            Connecticut’s witch trials were held in the mid-to-late 1600s. In each of the New England colonies, witchcraft was considered a capital offense. According to the earliest laws in the colony of Connecticut, “any man or women (to) bee a Witch, that is, hath or consulteth with a familiar spirit, they shall bee put to death.”

            Many historians believe fear and anxiety among the religiously strict English settlers led to the witch trials, noting how life was very difficult, given epidemics, floods, cold winters and starvation. Often, accusations started as a quarrel, or the death of a child or a cow, or even butter that couldn’t be churned.

            Many of the people executed as witches were poor, single mothers.

            Such was the case of Mary Johnson, a servant in Wethersfield, Connecticut, who was accused of “familiarity with the Devil.” 

            For years, she was tortured by a local minister who whipped her until she finally confessed to being a witch and admitted to “uncleanness with men,” according to Bridgeport author Andy Piascik, who wrote an article for Connecticut Humanities, an independent, nonprofit affiliate of the National Endowment for the Humanities. Johnson is believed to have been hanged after giving birth to the child of a man she was not married to.

            “It’s important to right the wrongs of the past so we learn from them and move on and not repeat those mistakes,” said Joshua Hutchinson, of Prescott Valley, Arizona, who traced his ancestry to accused witches in Salem and is the host of the “Thou Shalt Not Suffer: The Witch Trial Podcast.” 

            He noted that even in recent decades people have been killed in multiple countries because they were suspected of being witches or sorcerers.

            Beth Caruso, an author, co-founded the CT Witch Trial Exoneration Project in 2005 to clear the names of the accused. The group is encouraging people who discovered through genealogy research that they are descendants of victims to contact Connecticut state legislators and urge them to support exoneration legislation.

            Connecticut state Sen. Saud Anwar, who also proposed an exoneration bill, said he expects some people might laugh or scoff at the idea of the Legislature taking time to clear the records of accused witches. But he said the descendants are feeling some “serious stuff,” including a constituent who requested the resolution.

            “His wish was that if there was a way to give some kind of a closure to the families,” Anwar said, “that would be one way for him to be able to say that he has done his share, even though his ancestors may have not done the right thing.”HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — Decades before the infamous Salem witch trials in Massachusetts, Alse Young was killed at the gallows in Connecticut, becoming the first person on record to be executed in the American colonies for witchcraft.The Windsor town clerk registered the death on May 26, 1647, in a diary entry that read: “Alse Young was hanged.” Young was the first of nine women and two men executed by the colony of Connecticut for witchcraft over 15 years, a period during which more than 40 people faced trial for having ties to Satan.Now, more than 375 years later, amateur historians, researchers and descendants of the accused witches and their accusers hope Connecticut lawmakers will finally offer posthumous exonerations.While such requests aren’t new, they have become louder as many genealogy buffs discover they have distant relatives involved in the lesser-known Connecticut witch trials.“They’re talking about how this has followed their families from generation to generation and that they would love for someone just to say, ‘Hey, this was wrong,’” said Connecticut state Rep. Jane Garibay, who proposed an exoneration resolution after receiving letters from eighth- and ninth-generation relatives of accused witches. “And to me, that’s an easy thing to do if it gives people peace.”Other states and countries have attempted to atone for a history of persecuting people as witches. Last year, Scotland’s prime minister issued a formal apology to the estimated 4,000 Scots, mostly women, who were accused of witchcraft up until 1736. Of the 4,000, about 2,500 were killed.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796974,Texas executes inmate for 2007 fatal shooting of Dallas cop,"HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) — Texas on Wednesday executed an inmate convicted of fatally shooting a Dallas police officer nearly 16 years ago after a high-speed chase.

            Wesley Ruiz, 43, received a lethal injection at the state penitentiary in Huntsville, Texas, for the March 2007 killing of Dallas Police Senior Corporal Mark Nix. 

            “I would like to apologize to Mark and the Nix family for taking him away from you,"" Ruiz said as he was laying strapped to a gurney in the death chamber. “I hope this brings you closure.”











            He never looked at Nix's relatives and friends, including the slain officer's mother and sister, who watched through a window a few feet from him. Ruiz thanked his family and friends for supporting him and urged his children to “stand tall and continue to make me proud.”

            “Don't worry about me. I'm ready to fly,"" he said. ""All right warden, I'm ready to ride.""

            As the lethal dose of the powerful sedative pentobarbital began taking effect, he took two quick breaths, then began snoring. His 11th snore was his last and there was no further movement. Twenty-two minutes later, at 6:41 p.m., he was pronounced dead.

            Immediately before his statement, a spiritual adviser standing near Ruiz offered a brief prayer. Outside the brick walls of the prison, a group of about a dozen pro-police motorcyclists sat on their bikes in a cold drizzle, revving their engines and nearly drowning out her words for those inside.

            Ruiz was the second inmate put to death this year in Texas and the fourth in the U.S. Seven other executions are scheduled in Texas for later this year, including one next week.

            Nearly 16 years ago Ruiz led officers on a high-speed chase after being spotted driving a car that matched the description of one used by a murder suspect. Authorities said Ruiz fired one shot at Nix when the officer tried to break the vehicle’s passenger window after the chase. The bullet hit Nix’s badge, splintered it and sent fragments into his neck, severing an artery. He later died at a hospital. 

            Nix, 33, a U.S. Navy veteran of Operation Desert Storm, had been on the Dallas force for nearly seven years and was engaged to be married when he was killed. 

            The U.S. Supreme Court earlier Wednesday declined an appeal from Ruiz’s attorneys to halt the execution. The defense had argued that jurors relied on “overtly racist” and “blatant anti-Hispanic stereotypes” in appraising whether Ruiz posed a future danger, an element needed to secure a death sentence in Texas. Ruiz was Hispanic. 

            In court documents filed late Tuesday with the Supreme Court, the Texas Attorney General’s Office said Ruiz’s claim of juror bias had no merit because a review of the allegations conducted last week by Dallas County District Attorney John Creuzot found no such bias. One of the jurors accused of bias by Ruiz’s attorneys told Creuzot that, “I was not nor am not bias(ed) to anyone or any race,” according to the court filing. 

            Last week, U.S. District Judge David Godbey in Dallas denied a request to stay Ruiz’s execution, saying his attorneys failed to show that jurors had made statements during his trial showing “overt racial bias.” On Monday, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals also denied a similar stay request on claims of racial bias. The appeals court did not consider the merits of the claim, but rejected it on procedural grounds.

            Ruiz’s attorneys previously argued unsuccessfully that an expert witness for the prosecution falsely testified at the 2008 trial about Ruiz being an ongoing threat. His attorneys alleged prosecutors knew about the false testimony but remained silent about it. In his ruling, Godbey said the expert’s testimony “was quite possibly harmless” and even if it had been corrected, it would not have changed the jury’s decision to sentence Ruiz to death.

            The Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles on Monday unanimously declined to commute Ruiz’s death sentence to a lesser penalty. 

            Ruiz was one of five Texas death row inmates who sued to stop the state’s prison system from using what they allege are expired and unsafe execution drugs. Despite a civil court judge in Austin preliminarily agreeing with the claims, the state’s top two courts allowed one of the inmates who had been part of the litigation to be executed on Jan. 10. 

            Prison officials deny the lawsuit’s claims and say the state’s supply of execution drugs is safe. 

            At his trial, Ruiz testified he was afraid for his life when he fired in self-defense on Nix after the officer allegedly threatened to kill him. He also said he believed police fired their weapons first. 

            “I didn’t try to kill the officer. I just tried to stop him,” Ruiz testified. 

            Ruiz also said he fled from police that day because he had illegal drugs in his car and had taken drugs. 

            Gabriel Luchiano, who knew Nix when he worked as a security guard, said the officer always responded quickly when people needed help at the convenience store in northwest Dallas where Luchiano worked. 

            He was a “guardian angel,” said Luchiano. “It’s still painful no matter what. Nothing is going to close it.”

The same rule applied to people listed as a contact of a COVID case. From Feb. 7, they will only have to take a test if they show COVID symptoms.At the same time, the number of free rapid test kits available to arrivals will be reduced from four to one, as it has become easy to find antigen tests across the country, the health authorities said.The CECC said the Feb. 7 changes were in response to the global slowdown in virus infections and the capacity of the local health sector to deal with new cases.",2023/02/01,6229,Food Safety & Health
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796981,Taiwan ICU nurse frustrated at lack of health awareness,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — An ICU nurse took to Facebook to express her exasperation with the number of patients succumbing to medical conditions during recent cold snaps.Posting on her page 林婷一下吧 icu護理師, she said on typical evenings this winter a dozen or so patients are admitted to her ICU department due to heart attacks or strokes, filling up all available beds. She went on to say a number of those cases could have been prevented.A 70-year old individual who suffered an intracranial hemorrhagic stroke regularly took blood pressure medication but was not in the habit of monitoring his blood pressure. After an evening bath, his left hand suddenly felt weak as he was later rushed to the emergency room where his blood pressure slowly came back under control and he began to regain consciousness.Another 49 year old individual suffered a cerebral hemorrhage after smoking for 20 years and being diagnosed with high blood pressure a year ago. His doctor said that he did not need to take medication and he did not follow up with blood pressure monitoring.Recently, he felt unwell after drinking alcohol and came down with a headache. His wife suggested he was simply drunk and needed a shower and rest. After doing this, he collapsed and was taken to the hospital where his Glasgow Coma Scale dropped to 3 and he passed away shortly thereafter.The ICU nurse noted that this type of death is especially hard on family members as they have no chance to say goodbye. The scenario plays out all too often in ICUs where people are admitted for strokes and heart attacks, while many sufferers have telltale warning signs such as high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high cholesterol, and lifestyle habits such as smoking and drinking alcohol.When people are diagnosed with such indicators of early death, some turn a blind eye and disregard their health care provider with comments like, ""I know my own body...I should be fine,"" the ICU nurse said.She added that quite a few people under the age of 50 are regularly being sent to the ICU. These people have gradual cardiovascular system deterioration for 10-20 years with their cardiovascular systems becoming more brittle. When they reach 40 to 50, their blood vessels can suddenly explode and cause intracranial cerebral hemorrhage, cerebral infarction, or heart attack.To prevent emergency trips to the ICU, she recommended the following three tips.First off, regular health checks for people over 50. She said that if one can spend NT$2,000 (US$60) on scratch and win tickets for Lunar New Year, then a similar amount of money for a health check is well worth it.Secondly, if you suffer from the three highs (high blood pressure, etc.) or smoke and drink regularly, you may consider getting a CT scan or coronary artery check, and if vascular stenosis is found, doctors can prescribe medicine to treat it. Do not wait until you experience paralysis of the hands and feet or require radical intervention such as a stent.Thirdly, she advocated diet control, avoiding food that is too oily, too salty, or too sweet. She said she regularly encounters young taxi drivers and engineers who end up in the ICU with strokes and heart attacks attributed to a poor diet. She added that overweight people should consider exercise, and at a minimum, remember to take their medication.She said concerns that medication may hurt the kidneys and liver are unfounded, and the results of not taking prescribed medication can be much worse. Additionally, it is now common for many people under the age of 40 to take high blood pressure medication.In conclusion, she repeated the old adage that “the least painful treatment is prevention."" She urged everyone to look after their health so they can cherish their time with relatives and friends.",2023/02/01,2831,Opinion

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796989,"US, allies hit Myanmar with sanctions on coup anniversary","Marking Wednesday's two-year anniversary of Myanmar's military coup, the US and its allies announced further sanctions on the country.Washington, along with Canada and the United Kingdom and Australia on Tuesday imposed sanctions on the Union Election Commission, mining enterprises, energy officials and others, as per a statement by the US Treasury Department.The statement said this was the first time the US had targeted Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE) officials, the managing director and deputy managing director. It is the country's single largest revenue-generating state-owned enterprise.Mining Enterprise No 1 and Mining Enterprise No 2, both state-owned companies, as well as the Union Election Commission, were also hit with sanctions by Washington.Canada targeted six individuals and prohibited the export, sale, supply or shipment of aviation fuel. Australia targeted members of the junta and a military-run company.The UK designated two companies and two people for helping supply Myanmar's air force with aviation fuel used to carry out bombing campaigns.The sanctions come as Myanmar's military has conducted aerial bombings and other attacks against pro-democracy forces.On the same day, the independent UN special investigator on Myanmar warned that the military junta plans to seek legitimacy by orchestrating a ""sham"" election this year.""You cannot have a free and fair election when the opposition is arrested, detained, tortured, and executed, journalists are prohibited from doing their job, and it is a crime to criticize the military,"" Tom Andrews said at the UN.Myanmar's junta last month outlined plans to hold an election later in the year.To do that, it is supposed to lift the nationwide state of emergency six months beforehand. Observers had widely expected the military to announce it was preparing for the polls this week, with the state of emergency set to expire on Wednesday's anniversary.But on Tuesday, the junta-stacked National Security and Defense Council said the state of the country ""has not returned to normalcy yet,"" possibly casting that back into doubt.The statement accused opposition political groups of trying to seize ""state power by means of unrest and violence."" It said a further statement would follow on Wednesday.The junta had recently introduced new rules for parties contesting elections, which include a huge increase in their membership, a move that could sideline the military's opponents.The rules favor the Union Solidarity and Development Party, which was defeated by now jailed leader Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) party in 2015 and 2020 elections. The party includes several former military generals.The NLD and western nations have denounced the election, and said they would not acknowledge the results.John Sifton, Asia advocacy director for Human Rights Watch, told Reuters that the US has still not matched stronger sanctions imposed by the European Union.""As a result, the measures taken so far have not imposed enough economic pain on the junta to compel it to change its conduct,"" he said in.Myanmar's top generals led a coup in February 2021. The country has since seen instability, with a crackdown on dissent.According to the independent Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, a watchdog group that tracks killings and arrests in Myanmar, 2,940 civilians have been killed and 17,572 have been arrested by authorities since the army takeover.tg/msh  (AFP, AP, Reuters)",2023/02/01,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796998,"Peshawar, the city of flowers, becomes epicenter of violence","PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) — Pakistan’s Peshawar was once known as “the city of flowers,” surrounded by orchards of pear, quince and pomegranate trees. It was a trading city, situated at the gates of a key mountain valley connecting South and Central Asia. 

            But for the past four decades, it has borne the brunt of rising militancy in the region, fueled by the conflicts in neighboring Afghanistan and the geopolitical games of great powers. 

            On Tuesday, the city with a population of about 2 million was reeling after one of Pakistan’s most devastating militant attacks in years. A day earlier, a suicide bomber unleashed a blast in a mosque inside the city’s main police compound, killing at least 101 people and wounding at least 225, mostly police.











            Analysts say the carnage is the legacy of decades of flawed policies by Pakistan and the United States.

            “What you sow, so shall you reap,” said Abdullah Khan, a senior security analyst.

            Peshawar was a peaceful place, he said, until the early 1980s when Pakistan’s then-dictator Ziaul Haq decided to become part of Washington's cold war with Moscow, joining the fight against the 1979 Soviet invasion of neighboring Afghanistan.

            Peshawar — less than 30 kilometers (20 miles) from the Afghan border — became the center where the American CIA and Pakistani military helped train, arm and fund the Afghan mujahedeen fighting the Soviets. The city was flooded by weapons and fighters, many of them hard-line Islamic militants, as well as with hundreds of thousands of Afghan refugees. 

            Arab militants were also drawn there by the fight against the Soviets, including the scion of a wealthy Saudi family, Osama bin Laden. It was in Peshawar that bin Laden founded al-Qaida in the late 1980s, joining forces with veteran Egyptian militant Ayman al-Zawahri. 

            The Soviets finally withdrew in defeat from Afghanistan in 1989. But the legacy of militancy and armed resistance that the U.S. and Pakistan fueled against them remained. 

            “After the Russian withdrawal from Afghanistan in 1980s, Americans abandoned mujahedeen, Americans even abandoned us, and since then we are paying a price for it,” said Mahmood Shah, a former Pakistani army brigadier and a senior security analyst.

            The mujahedeen plunged Afghanistan into civil war in a bloody fight for power. Meanwhile, in Peshawar and another Pakistani city, Quetta, the Afghan Taliban began to organize, with backing from the Pakistani government. Eventually, the Taliban took power in Afghanistan in the late 1990s, ruling until they were ousted by the 2001 American-led invasion following al-Qaida’s 9/11 attacks in the U.S. 

            During the nearly 20-year U.S. war against the Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan, militant groups blossomed in the tribal regions of Pakistan along the border and around Peshawar. Like the Taliban, they found root among the ethnic Pashtuns who make up a majority in the region and in the city. 

            Some groups were encouraged by the Pakistani intelligence agencies. But others turned their guns against the government, angered by heavy security crackdowns and by frequent U.S. airstrikes in the border region targeting al-Qaida and other militants. 

            Chief among the anti-government groups was the Pakistani Taliban, or Tahreek-e Taliban-Pakistani, or TTP. In the late 2000s and early 2010s, it waged a brutal campaign of violence around the country. Peshawar was scene of one of the bloodiest TTP attacks in 2014, on an army-run public school that killed nearly 150 people, most of them schoolboys.

            Peshawar’s location has for centuries made it a key juncture between Central Asia and the Indian subcontinent. One of the oldest cities in Asia, it stands at the entrance to the Khyber Pass, the main route between the two regions. That was a source of its prosperity in trade and put it on the path of armies going both directions, from Moghul emperors to British imperialists. 

            A heavy military offensive largely put down the TTP for several years and the government and the militants eventually reached an uneasy truce. Peshawar came under heavy security control, with checkpoints dotting the main roads, and a heavy presence of police and paramilitary troops. 

            TTP attacks, however, have grown once more since the Afghan Taliban returned to power in Kabul in August 2021 amid the U.S. and NATO withdrawal from that country. The Pakistani Taliban are distinct from but allied to the Afghan group, and Pakistani officials regularly accuse the Afghan Taliban of giving the TTP free rein to operate from Afghan territory. 

            On Wednesday, several police officers joined a peace march organized by the members of civil society groups in Peshawar, denouncing militant attacks and demanding peace in the country. Police said they made some arrest in connection with Monday's mosque bombing but did not provide details.

            Ahead of Monday’s suicide bombing, Peshawar had seen increasing small-scale attacks targeting police. In another spillover from Afghanistan’s conflict, the regional affiliate of the Islamic State group attacked Peshawar’s main Shiite mosque in March 2022, killing more than 60 people. 

            Shah, the former officer, warned that more TTP attacks could follow and said that Pakistan needs to engage the Afghan Taliban and pressure them to either evict the TTP or ensure it doesn’t launch attacks from Afghan territory. 

            “If we are to have peace in Pakistan, we should talk to TTP from the position of strength with help from the Afghan Taliban,” he said. “This is the best and viable solution to avoid more violence.”

            Ahmed reported from Islamabad.PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) — Pakistan’s Peshawar was once known as “the city of flowers,” surrounded by orchards of pear, quince and pomegranate trees. It was a trading city, situated at the gates of a key mountain valley connecting South and Central Asia.But for the past four decades, it has borne the brunt of rising militancy in the region, fueled by the conflicts in neighboring Afghanistan and the geopolitical games of great powers.On Tuesday, the city with a population of about 2 million was reeling after one of Pakistan’s most devastating militant attacks in years. A day earlier, a suicide bomber unleashed a blast in a mosque inside the city’s main police compound, killing at least 101 people and wounding at least 225, mostly police.Analysts say the carnage is the legacy of decades of flawed policies by Pakistan and the United States.“What you sow, so shall you reap,” said Abdullah Khan, a senior security analyst.Peshawar was a peaceful place, he said, until the early 1980s when Pakistan’s then-dictator Ziaul Haq decided to become part of Washington's cold war with Moscow, joining the fight against the 1979 Soviet invasion of neighboring Afghanistan.Peshawar — less than 30 kilometers (20 miles) from the Afghan border — became the center where the American CIA and Pakistani military helped train, arm and fund the Afghan mujahedeen fighting the Soviets. The city was flooded by weapons and fighters, many of them hard-line Islamic militants, as well as with hundreds of thousands of Afghan refugees.Arab militants were also drawn there by the fight against the Soviets, including the scion of a wealthy Saudi family, Osama bin Laden. It was in Peshawar that bin Laden founded al-Qaida in the late 1980s, joining forces with veteran Egyptian militant Ayman al-Zawahri.The Soviets finally withdrew in defeat from Afghanistan in 1989. But the legacy of militancy and armed resistance that the U.S. and Pakistan fueled against them remained.“After the Russian withdrawal from Afghanistan in 1980s, Americans abandoned mujahedeen, Americans even abandoned us, and since then we are paying a price for it,” said Mahmood Shah, a former Pakistani army brigadier and a senior security analyst.The mujahedeen plunged Afghanistan into civil war in a bloody fight for power. Meanwhile, in Peshawar and another Pakistani city, Quetta, the Afghan Taliban began to organize, with backing from the Pakistani government. Eventually, the Taliban took power in Afghanistan in the late 1990s, ruling until they were ousted by the 2001 American-led invasion following al-Qaida’s 9/11 attacks in the U.S.During the nearly 20-year U.S. war against the Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan, militant groups blossomed in the tribal regions of Pakistan along the border and around Peshawar. Like the Taliban, they found root among the ethnic Pashtuns who make up a majority in the region and in the city.Some groups were encouraged by the Pakistani intelligence agencies. But others turned their guns against the government, angered by heavy security crackdowns and by frequent U.S. airstrikes in the border region targeting al-Qaida and other militants.Chief among the anti-government groups was the Pakistani Taliban, or Tahreek-e Taliban-Pakistani, or TTP. In the late 2000s and early 2010s, it waged a brutal campaign of violence around the country. Peshawar was scene of one of the bloodiest TTP attacks in 2014, on an army-run public school that killed nearly 150 people, most of them schoolboys.Peshawar’s location has for centuries made it a key juncture between Central Asia and the Indian subcontinent. One of the oldest cities in Asia, it stands at the entrance to the Khyber Pass, the main route between the two regions. That was a source of its prosperity in trade and put it on the path of armies going both directions, from Moghul emperors to British imperialists.A heavy military offensive largely put down the TTP for several years and the government and the militants eventually reached an uneasy truce.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796999,Myanmar resistance steadfast against army rule 2 years later,"BANGKOK (AP) — The prospects for peace in Myanmar, much less a return to democracy, seem dimmer than ever two years after the army seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, experts say.

            On Wednesday, legions of opponents of military rule heeded a call by protest organizers to stay home in what they termed a “silent strike” to show their strength and solidarity.

            The opposition’s General Strike Coordination Body, formed soon after the 2021 takeover, urged people to stay inside their homes or workplaces from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Photos posted on social media showed empty streets in normally bustling downtown Yangon, the country’s largest city, with just a few vehicles on the roads, and there were reports of similar scenes elsewhere.











            Small peaceful protests are an almost-daily occurrence throughout the country, but on the anniversary of the Feb. 1, 2021, seizure of power by the army, two points stand out: The amount of violence, especially in the countryside, has reached the level of civil war; and the grassroots movement opposing military rule has defied expectations by largely holding off the ruling generals.

            The violence extends beyond the rural battlefields where the army is burning and bombing villages, displacing hundreds of thousands of people in what is a largely neglected humanitarian crisis. It also occurs in the cities, where activists are arrested and tortured and urban guerrillas retaliate with bombings and assassinations of targets linked to the military. The military, after closed trials, have also executed activists accused of “terrorism.”

            According to the independent Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, a watchdog group that tracks killings and arrests, 2,940 civilians have been killed by the authorities since the army takeover, and another 17,572 have been arrested — 13,763 of whom remain detained. The actual death toll is likely to be much higher since the group does not generally include deaths on the side of the military government and cannot easily verify cases in remote areas.

            “The level of violence involving both armed combatants and civilians is alarming and unexpected,” said Min Zaw Oo, a veteran political activist in exile who founded the Myanmar Institute for Peace and Security. 

            “The scale of the killing and harm inflicted on civilians has been devastating, and unlike anything we have seen in the country in recent memory,"" he said.

            When the army ousted Suu Kyi in 2021, it arrested her and top members of her governing National League for Democracy party, which had won a landslide victory for a second term in a November 2020 general election. The military claimed it acted because there had been massive electoral fraud, a claim not backed up by objective election observers. Suu Kyi, 77, is serving prison sentences totaling 33 years after being convicted in a series of politically tainted prosecutions brought by the military.

            Shortly after the military seized power and quashed nonviolent protests with lethal force, thousands of young people slipped away to remote rural areas to become guerrilla fighters. 

            Operating in decentralized “People’s Defense Forces,” or PDFs, they are proving to be effective warriors, specializing in ambushes and occasionally overrunning isolated army and police posts. They have benefited greatly from supplies and training provided by the some of the country’s ethnic minority rebels — Ethnic Armed Organizations, or EAOs — who have been fighting the army for decades for greater autonomy.

            ""That’s not only a very brave thing to do. It’s a very difficult thing to do,” Richard Horsey, an independent analyst and adviser to the International Crisis Group, told The Associated Press. “It’s a very challenging thing to do, to take on, you know, a military that’s been fighting counterinsurgency warfare (for) basically its whole existence.”

            David Mathieson, an independent analyst with over 20 years' experience in Myanmar, said the opposition’s combat capabilities are “a mixed picture in terms of battlefield performance, organization and unity amongst them.”

            “But it’s also important to remember, two years in, that no one was predicting that they were actually going to be as effective as they are now. And in certain areas, the PDFs have been taking on the Myanmar military and, in many respects, besting them on the battlefield in terms of ambush and pitched battles, taking over bases.”

            He says the military’s heavy weaponry and air power push the situation into a kind of a stalemate in which the PDFs are not necessarily taking over large swaths of territory, but fighting back and prevailing. 

            “So no one’s winning at the moment,” Mathieson said.

            The military government of Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing has an advantage — not just in arms and trained manpower, but also in geography. Myanmar's main neighbors — Thailand, China and India — have geopolitical and economic interests in Myanmar that leave them satisfied with the status quo, which largely secures its borders from becoming a major supply route for weapons and other supplies for the resistance. And while much of the world maintains sanctions against the generals and their government, they can rely on obtaining arms from Russia and China.

            Min Aung Hlaing’s government is also nominally pursuing a political solution to the crisis it caused, most notably in its promise to hold a new election this year. Suu Kyi’s party has rejected taking part, deriding the polls as neither free nor fair, and other activists are employing more direct action, attacking teams from the military government who are conducting surveys to compile voter rolls.

            “The regime is pushing for an election which the opposition has vowed to derail,” said Min Zaw Oo. “The election won’t change the political status quo; instead, it will intensify violence.”

            The planned polls “are being run by a regime that overturned the popularly elected government. They are clearly being seen by the Myanmar people for what they are: a cynical effort to overwrite those previous election results that gave a landslide victory to Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy, so these are not elections in any meaningful sense of the word,"" Horsey said. ""They have no legitimacy or credibility.”

            In what amounted to an admission that it does not exercise enough control to stage the polls, the military government on Wednesday night announced it is further extending a state of emergency imposed when it seized power two years ago. That means, under Myanmar's constitution, that it will be impossible to hold the election in August, a date that Min Aung Hlaing earlier said was under consideration.

            State-run MRTV television said the state of emergency has been extended another six months because the country remains in an abnormal situation and time is needed to prepare for a peaceful and stable election. It did not offer a date for when the polls might be held.

            On the diplomatic front, the military government has thumbed its nose at international efforts to defuse the crisis, even those from sympathetic fellow members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, whose harshest response has been to not invite Myanmar’s top military leaders to its meetings. 

            Myanmar's army government rejects virtually all efforts at peacemaking as interference in its internal affairs.

            The resistance, by contrast, has actively reached out for international support. It won small new diplomatic victories Tuesday as the United States, Australia, Britain and Canada announced new sanctions meant to squeeze the military’s revenue and supply lines. The British and Canadian sanctions are especially noteworthy, as they target the supply of aviation fuel, a move activists have been seeking to counter the increasing number of airstrikes that pro-democracy forces and their allies in ethnic minority rebel groups have been facing in the field.

            “Currently, both sides are not ready to seek a political solution,” said Min Zaw Oo. “The military stalemate won’t shift significantly this year, despite more deaths and violence.”BANGKOK (AP) — The prospects for peace in Myanmar, much less a return to democracy, seem dimmer than ever two years after the army seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, experts say.On Wednesday, legions of opponents of military rule heeded a call by protest organizers to stay home in what they termed a “silent strike” to show their strength and solidarity.The opposition’s General Strike Coordination Body, formed soon after the 2021 takeover, urged people to stay inside their homes or workplaces from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Photos posted on social media showed empty streets in normally bustling downtown Yangon, the country’s largest city, with just a few vehicles on the roads, and there were reports of similar scenes elsewhere.Small peaceful protests are an almost-daily occurrence throughout the country, but on the anniversary of the Feb. 1, 2021, seizure of power by the army, two points stand out: The amount of violence, especially in the countryside, has reached the level of civil war; and the grassroots movement opposing military rule has defied expectations by largely holding off the ruling generals.The violence extends beyond the rural battlefields where the army is burning and bombing villages, displacing hundreds of thousands of people in what is a largely neglected humanitarian crisis.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797000,Nevada upends No. 22 San Diego State 75-66,"RENO, Nev. (AP) — Jarod Lucas scored 26 points and Will Baker had 19 points and eight rebounds as Nevada beat No. 22 San Diego State 75-66 on Tuesday night.

            Kenan Blackshear added 18 points and seven assists for the Wolf Pack (17-6, 7-3 Mountain West Conference), who won their second consecutive home game against a ranked opponent for the first time in program history. Nevada defeated then-No. 25 New Mexico 97-94 in double overtime last week.

            “Our guys are jacked. They’re excited,” Nevada coach Steve Alford said. “If you’ve followed this team you know they’re fun to watch.”











            Matt Bradley scored 16 points to lead the Aztecs (17-5, 8-2).

            Neither team had more than a three-point lead from the 9:27 mark of the second half until Blackshear made a layup to give Nevada a 67-62 advantage with 1:57 to play.

            The Wolf Pack went 8 for 8 at the free throw line in the final 69 seconds to seal it and shot 65% from the field in the second half against one of the best defensive teams in the country.

            Tre Coleman hit a trio of 3-pointers after halftime and finished with 11 points.

            “You can’t let a team shoot 65% and expect to win,” San Diego State coach Brian Dutcher said. “But Baker hit some tough shots and we let Blackshear go downhill on us. … (Nevada has) a great rhythm about them.”

            Nevada's victory snapped SDSU’s nine-game winning streak in the series. 

            Baker scored five points as Nevada opened the second half with a 14-5 spurt to take a 42-35 lead. But then Lamont Butler drained a 3-pointer and Aguek Arop made a layup as SDSU quickly answered and tied it at 42 with 12:52 to play.

            SDSU’s Darrion Trammell was assessed a technical foul in the opening minutes when Lucas was knocked down after a whistle in front of the Nevada bench. Some jawing ensued and San Diego State coaches had to restrain some Aztecs players from leaving their bench.

            Lucas picked himself up off the floor at least a half-dozen times. He and Bradley each had 11 points at the 7:23 mark of the first half, more than half their team’s total in a 20-20 game.

            Lucas, a senior guard who transferred from Oregon State after last season, scored seven points during a 10-1 Nevada run that erased the Aztecs’ 11-4 lead. But neither team had more than a four-point edge the rest of the half and SDSU took a 30-28 advantage into the break.

            Nevada’s victory caused a traffic jam atop the Mountain West standings. San Diego State dropped into a tie for first place with Boise State, which defeated Air Force 59-52 on Tuesday. Nevada is one game back, with New Mexico and Utah State both 1 1/2 games behind.

            “It’s always special when you get a big win,” Lucas said. “We kind of looked at it as a must-win to keep in the race for the Mountain West championship. We’ve got a long ways to go, but it put us in a good position.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797001,Okta Study Finds Fraudulent Registrations and Credential Stuffing to be Top Threats to Digital Identities,"Robust and resilient Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) exists at the vanguard of identity security

   SINGAPORE -  Media OutReach - 1 February 2023 - Okta, Inc. (NASDAQ: OKTA), the leading independent identity provider, today unveiled the APAC findings of its second annual  State of Secure Identity Report highlighting key areas of concern for security professionals tasked with managing digital identities, including the exponential rise of fraudulent registration, credential stuffing attacks, and the widespread use of breached credentials.   Based on the data across the world from Okta Customer Identity Cloud, powered by Auth0, this report presents trends, examples, and real-world observations from the billions of identity attacks at various authentications touchpoints.   Research into these Okta global customers found the following key facts and figures:     Fraudulent registrations are an ever-present and growing threat: In the first 90 days of 2022, Okta observed almost 300 million fraudulent account creation attempts, accounting for about 23% of signup attempts, up from 15% in the same period last year. Energy/Utilities and Financial Services experienced the highest proportion of signup attacks, with such threats accounting for most of the registration attempts in those two industries.     Credential stuffing is on a record pace: Credential stuffing attacks are the most common threats to Retail/eCommerce (more than 80% login activity), Financial Services and Entertainment verticals. In the first 90 days of 2022, the platform detected almost 10 billion credential stuffing events, representing some 34% of overall traffic or authentication events. In Southeast Asia, which was buoyed by several large-scale attacks, credential stuffing accounts for the majority of identity events. The situation in Australia and New Zealand was more sanguine — normal traffic represents the majority of login events (63%), and only during a large attack does credential stuffing overtake legitimate traffic.     Threat actors are targeting multi-factor authentication (MFA): In Asia Pacific, MFA bypass attacks are responsible for more events than signup attacks. Because of its proven merits, more application and service providers are recommending or requiring MFA. As attackers become more sophisticated at targeting this important defensive measure, it's critical that MFA be implemented correctly and that strong secondary factors are chosen.     Every company faces unique challenges. The threats facing any particular application or service vary enormously by geography, industry, and brand prominence, among other factors. At the same time, different organizations have different risk appetites and exposures. The appropriate level of friction introduced by security measures will therefore vary on a company-to-company basis.     ""Digital transformation will continue to be high on the priority list for many organizations, and a reliable CIAM could help businesses combat account takeover to protect consumers and businesses while boosting seamless consumer experience,"" said Ben Goodman, Senior Vice President and General Manager for Asia Pacific & Japan, Okta. ""The first step towards implementing CIAM securely is to understand why and how adversaries are attacking these customer-oriented businesses,"" he added.   Applications gain users, identity takes on even greater Importance   As adversaries focus greater attention on attacking identity systems and evolving their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), the report highlighted that it is essential for application and service providers to:        Implement defence-in-depth tools that work in combination across the user, application, and network layers         Continually monitor their applications for signs of attacks and changes in TTPs; and         Make adjustments (e.g., tune parameters, tighten restrictions, introduce new tools, etc.) as needed.     Leaders across these functions should work together to implement CIAM in a manner that balances quality of customer experience and system security, in the context of desired use cases, customer types, data types, industry-specific risks, and risk appetite.   ""Trust between customers and organizations is sacred and hard-earned, therefore it is crucial to make identity security a board-level issue. Placing identity security at the core of your business will allow your workers to focus on innovation, collaboration, and productivity while reducing overall identity-related risk,"" Goodman added.   Managing CIAM Threats   The report also highlighted that an agile, secure-by-design CIAM solution permits a considerable amount of flexibility that allow organizations to tailor customer identity and access management — and continually tune as needed — without drawing in resources better applied toward advancing core competencies.   The report recommends several solutions that involve combining multiple security tools that can operate at different layers and form a unified defensive position. These include implementing MFA, using generic failure messages that do not reveal system details, limiting failed login attempts, and implementing secure session management practices.

It put Taiwan in 14th place, the highest in Asia, followed by Japan at 16th. South Korea, Hong Kong, and China were ranked 30th, 34th, and 152nd, respectively.The top 10 spots were Switzerland, New Zealand, Estonia, Denmark, Ireland, Sweden, Iceland, Finland, Netherlands, and Luxembourg.The rankings assess the state of human freedom based on a host of measures encompassing personal, civil, and economic freedom. A total of 83 indicators were gauged for the 2022 index, including rule of law; security and safety; movement; religion; association, assembly, and civil society; expression and information; relationships; the size of government; legal system and property rights; sound money; freedom to trade internationally; and regulation.The report found that COVID-19 dealt a blow to overall human freedom. Meanwhile, it indicated that only 13.4% of the global population was living in the top quartile of the HFI countries.The regions with the lowest levels of freedom were South Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, and North Africa. The highest levels were in Western Europe, North America (Canada and the United States), and Oceania.",2023/02/01,1081,Society

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797043,Needle in a haystack found: Australia recovers missing radioactive capsule,"SYDNEY, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Australian authorities on Wednesday found a radioactive capsule smaller than a coin that was lost in the vast Outback after nearly a week-long search along a 1,400 kilometres (870 miles) stretch of highway, officials said.The Caesium-137 capsule was discovered when a vehicle travelling at 70 kms per hour equipped with specialist detection equipment picked up the radiation, according to officials from the state of Western Australia.The search team then used portable detection equipment to find the capsule, which was located about 2 metres from the side of the road, they added.""I do want to emphasise this is an extraordinary result,"" Western Australia's Emergency Services Minister Stephen Dawson said in a news conference.""When you consider the scope of the research area, locating this object was a monumental challenge, the search groups have quite literally found the needle in the haystack,"" Dawson said.The military was verifying the capsule and it would be taken to a secure facility in the city of Perth on Thursday, he added.Officials from Western Australia's emergency response department, defence authorities, radiation specialists and others have been combing the a stretch of highway for the tiny capsule that was lost in transit more than two weeks ago.The radioactive capsule was part of a gauge used to measure the density of iron ore feed from Rio Tinto's RIO.AX Gudai-Darri mine in the state's remote Kimberley region. The ore was being taken to a facility in the suburbs of Perth - a distance longer than the length of Great Britain.Officials said the capsule apparently fell off a truck and landed on the side of the road, adding that it was unlikely there will be contamination in the area.The silver capsule, 6 mm in diameter and 8 mm long, contains Caesium-137 which emits radiation equal to 10 X-rays per hour.People had been told to stay at least five metres (16.5 feet) away from the capsule if they spotted it, because exposure could cause radiation burns or radiation sickness. However, driving past it was believed to be relatively low risk, akin to taking an X-ray.Western Australia's Chief Health Officer Andrew Robertson said the capsule was found in a remote area far from any community and it was unlikely anyone had been exposed to radiation.He said there would be an investigation and prosecutions would be considered under state radiation safety laws from 1975.The maximum penalty for failing to safely handle radioactive substances is A$1,000 and A$50 per day the offence continues, though the state government said on Wednesday it was considering a change to laws to allow for bigger penalties.",2023/02/01,277,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797045,Austin's Manila visit to bring deal on expanded base access - Philippines official,"WASHINGTON, Jan 31 (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin's visit to the Philippines this week is expected to bring an announcement of expanded U.S. access to military bases in the country, a senior Philippines official said on Tuesday.Washington is eager to extend its security options in the Philippines as part of efforts to deter any move by China against self-ruled Taiwan, while Manila wants to bolster defense of its territorial claims in the disputed South China Sea.U.S. officials have said Washington hopes for an access agreement during Austin's visit, which began on Tuesday, and that Washington has proposed additional sites under an Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) dating back to 2014.""There's a push for another four or five of these EDCA sites,"" the a senior Philippines official said. ""We are going to have definitely an announcement of some sort. I just don't know how many would be the final outcome of that.""The official declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.Manila and Washington have a mutual defense treaty and have been discussing U.S. access to four additional bases on the northern land mass of Luzon, the closest part of the Philippines to Taiwan, as well as another on the island of Palawan, facing the disputed Spratly Islands in the South China Sea.EDCA allows U.S. access to Philippine bases for joint training, pre-positioning of equipment and building of facilities such as runways, fuel storage and military housing, but not a permanent presence. The U.S. military already has access to five such sites.The Philippines official said increased U.S. access needed to benefit both countries.""We don't want it to be directed to just for the use of the United States purely for their defense capabilities ... it has to be mutually beneficial,"" he said.""And obviously, we want to make sure that no country will see ... anything that we're doing ... was directed towards any conflict or anything of that sort,"" he added.Manila's priorities in its agreements with Washington were to boost its defense capabilities and interoperability with U.S. forces and to improve its ability to cope with climate change and natural disasters, the official said.He said that after cancelling an agreement for the purchase of heavy-lift helicopters from Russia last year, Manila had reached a deal with Washington to upgrade ""a couple"" of Blackhawk helicopters that could be used for disaster relief.""The deal with Russia was very attractive because for a certain budget we were able to get something like 16 of these heavy-lift helicopters,"" the official said. ""Now with the United States, obviously their helicopters are more expensive, so we're looking at how we can fit in the budget that we've had.""Gregory Poling, a Southeast Asia expert at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, said access to sites in northern Luzon would help U.S. efforts to deter any Chinese move against Taiwan by putting the waters to the south of the island within range of shore-based missiles.He said the U.S. and Philippine marines were pursuing similar capabilities with ground-based rockets, with Manila's particular interest being to protect its South China Sea claims.The Philippines is among several countries at odds with China in the South China Sea and has been angered by the constant presence of vessels in its exclusive economic zone it says are manned by Chinese militia. China is also Manila's main trading partner.",2023/02/01,191,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797067,Asia's factory activity contracts despite China's COVID reopening,"TOKYO, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Asia's factory activity contracted in January as the boost from China's COVID reopening had yet to offset headwinds from slowing U.S. and European growth, surveys showed on Wednesday, underscoring the fragility of the region's economic recovery.
China's factory activity shrank more slowly in January after Beijing lifted tough COVID curbs late last year, a private sector survey showed.
Softening input-price pressures also offered initial positive signs for Asia, with the pace of contraction in output slowing in Japan and South Korea, the surveys showed.
But there is uncertainty about whether Asia can weather the hit from slowing global demand and stubbornly high inflation, some analysts say.
""The worst of Asia's downturn is behind, but the outlook is clouded by weaknesses in major export destinations like the United States and Europe,"" said Toru Nishihama, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute in Tokyo.
""With the recovery from COVID-19 under way, Asian economies need a new growth engine. There isn't one so far.""
China's Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) nudged up to 49.2 in January from 49.0 in the previous month, staying below the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction for a sixth straight month.
The data was contrasted with a better-than-expected official PMI survey issued on Tuesday. But whereas the official PMI largely focuses on big and state-owned Chinese businesses, the Caixin survey centres on small firms and coastal regions.
Japan's au Jibun Bank PMI stood at 48.9 in January, unchanged from the previous month, as manufacturers felt the pain from weak global demand.
But supplier delays were less prevalent than at any time since February 2021, while input and output price inflation were the slowest in 16 months, the Japan PMI survey showed.
South Korea's factory activity contracted for a seventh straight month in January. The reading was 48.5, up from 48.2 in December but below the 50-point-threshold.
While new orders in South Korea shrank for a seventh straight month in January, the rate of decline was slightly slower than a month earlier, the survey showed.
""The immediate outlook for the South Korean manufacturing sector appears challenging,"" said Usamah Bhatti, economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence.
""That said, firms remained confident that global economic conditions would improve and stimulate demand.""
Factory activity expanded in January in Indonesia and the Philippines but shrank in Malaysia and Taiwan, PMI surveys showed.
India's manufacturing industry started the year on a weaker note, expanding at the slowest pace in three months in January as output and sales growth slackened.
The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday slightly raised its 2023 global growth outlook on ""surprisingly resilient"" demand in the United States and Europe and the reopening of China's economy after Beijing abandoned its strict pandemic controls.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797083,Duck hunt comes to conclusion in southern Taiwan,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — One would be tempted to call it a “wild goose chase” but it was a duck that went missing with police precincts launching a massive hunt since Monday (Jan.30).Firecracker celebrations for the Jade Emperor, also known as the Lord of Heaven, startled a domesticated duck living in Meinong District, Kaohsiung, leading it to take flight and flee in the middle of the night, posing a threat to itself and traffic, per Liberty Times.Surveillance footage later spotted the duck avoiding traffic from passing scooters and cars. The runaway duck then encountered a concerned couple who quickly scooped it up in their arms and brought it home with them.Kaohsiung’s Qishan Police Department said the duck hunt began when they were contacted by a woman surnamed Hsueh (薛) in her 60s who reported her pure white call duck had recently gone missing. She was heartbroken as she had been raising her feathered companion for more than two years.Call ducks are a particular breed popular in Holland for their calm demeanor and small size. They are easily domesticated and trained, so much so that they can be used as real-life decoys for duck hunting. They are also suitable as pets.However, they may be triggered by loud noises such as recent volleys of firecrackers to celebrate the Jade Emperor on the ninth day of the Lunar New Year, a sound which emanated from one household after another in Meinong. It was this loud noise which caused Hsueh’s call duck to fly over a fence and disappear.Zhongtan Police Precinct Chief Fu Chun-yi (傅鈞詣) said Hsueh asked police for assistance to track down her duck. Police officer Kuo Wang-lin (郭旺霖) checked surveillance footage in the area and found that her duck traveled along Zhongxiao Road where it eventually encountered a concerned couple on a scooter.The policeman then checked the license plate of the scooter and made a call to the home address. A man surnamed Cheng (鄭) answered and said that he was worried the duck would be hit by a car, so he picked it up, and added he also checked if there was an anklet or other identifying marks.With no way to contact the owner, he simply took it home and began to care for it, where he was surprised how comfortable the duck was with people, leading him to speculate it was someone's pet. He struggled with how to deal with the duck until he received the call from the police.According to the pet industry, call ducks can fetch a market price between NT$5,000-20,000 (US$150-600). It makes a peculiar sound and a mature male can grow to no more than 570 grams.Police later went to Cheng's house to collect the duck and returned it to Hsueh at the Zhongtan Police Precinct. Hsueh was overjoyed after being reunited with her prized pet, profusely thanking both the police and the public for their help.",2023/02/01,2304,Society
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797084,Kurdish officials: Rockets hit Turkish base in northern Iraq,"IRBIL, Iraq (AP) — A cluster of rockets targeted a Turkish military base in northern Iraq on Wednesday, officials from northern Iraq's semiautonomous Kurdish region said. An Iranian-backed militia promptly claimed responsibility for the attack.

            A Turkish defense ministry official said there was no damage or injury at the base but did not provide further details. The official spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.

            According to a statement from the Iraqi Kurdish region's anti-terrorism department, at least eight rockets were fired at Turkey's Zilkan military base in Iraq's northern Nineveh province, with two hitting the base itself. 











            Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar dismissed the incident, saying the base comes under attack “from time to time,” prompting retaliatory fire. He said the Turkish soldiers were “fighting there with increased resolve and determination.”

            Turkey has long been conducting military operations in northern Iraq, with both ground and air forces, to battle the banned Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, which has been waging a decadeslong insurgency against Ankara. 

            The PKK maintains sanctuaries in the Kurdish region of Iraq and Turkish forces have frequently launched airstrikes targeting the PKK.

            Separately from its operations against the PKK, Turkey was also part of the war against the Islamic State group — which seized control of much of the area in 2014 — and an ally in the U.S.-led anti-IS campaign.

            Turkey has also set up several bases in the area — much to the displeasure of Baghdad officials and some in the regional Iraqi Kurdish government, which has not officially condemned the Turkish troop presence. The facilities have occasionally been targeted in rocket attacks.

            Turkey established Zilkan base in 2015, during the war against IS. It is located close to the Iraqi city of Mosul, at the time a stronghold of the extremists. 

            The Iraqi government has frequently condemned Turkey's military presence, often describing it as illegal.

            Shortly after Wednesday's attack, the Islamic Resistance Ahrar al-Iraq Brigade — which is part of Iraq's pro-government, Iran-backed umbrella group of Shiite militias called the Popular Mobilization Forces — said it was behind the rocket fire.

He said the Turkish soldiers were “fighting there with increased resolve and determination.”Turkey has long been conducting military operations in northern Iraq, with both ground and air forces, to battle the banned Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, which has been waging a decadeslong insurgency against Ankara.The PKK maintains sanctuaries in the Kurdish region of Iraq and Turkish forces have frequently launched airstrikes targeting the PKK.Separately from its operations against the PKK, Turkey was also part of the war against the Islamic State group — which seized control of much of the area in 2014 — and an ally in the U.S.-led anti-IS campaign.Turkey has also set up several bases in the area — much to the displeasure of Baghdad officials and some in the regional Iraqi Kurdish government, which has not officially condemned the Turkish troop presence. The facilities have occasionally been targeted in rocket attacks.Turkey established Zilkan base in 2015, during the war against IS. It is located close to the Iraqi city of Mosul, at the time a stronghold of the extremists.The Iraqi government has frequently condemned Turkey's military presence, often describing it as illegal.Shortly after Wednesday's attack, the Islamic Resistance Ahrar al-Iraq Brigade — which is part of Iraq's pro-government, Iran-backed umbrella group of Shiite militias called the Popular Mobilization Forces — said it was behind the rocket fire.___Associated Press writers Suzan Fraser in Ankara, Turkey, and Kareem Chehayeb in Beirut contributed to this report.",2023/02/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797085,Andrew Tate loses appeal against 30-day detention in Romania,"BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) — A Romanian court on Wednesday upheld a second 30-day detention for the divisive influencer and former professional kickboxer Andrew Tate who is held on suspicion of organized crime and human trafficking, an official said.

            Tate lost his appeal against a judge’s Jan. 20 decision to extend his arrest a second time for 30 days, said Ramona Bolla, a spokesperson for Romania’s anti-organized crime agency DIICOT.

            Tate, 36, a British-U.S. citizen who has nearly 5 million followers on Twitter, arrived at the Bucharest Court of Appeal handcuffed to his brother Tristan, who is held in the same case along with two Romanian women. None of the four have yet been formally charged.











            The court rejected their appeals and all will remain in custody until Feb. 27 as prosecutors continue investigating the case. They previously lost an appeal against an earlier 30-day extension.

            A document seen by The Associated Press explaining the Jan. 20 decision said the judge took into account the ""particular dangerousness of the defendants” and their capacity to identify victims “with an increased vulnerability, in search of better life opportunities.”

            Tina Glandian, an American lawyer who has previously represented celebrities including singer Chris Brown and former heavyweight boxer Mike Tyson, joined the Tates’ legal defense team on Wednesday to work alongside them.

            “The defense team made extensive legal arguments pointing out the lack of evidence against the Tate brothers,” she told a news conference before the ruling. “It’s no secret that the Tate brothers are controversial public personas, but this is not about their public persona ... this is about the violation of international human rights and the due process of law.”

            “So far the system has failed,” she said. “The Tate brothers, who are both U.S. citizens, have been in jail for over 30 days now without bail and without any charges filed against them.”

            As the Tates left the court after Wednesday's morning hearing, Andrew Tate said: “Ask them for evidence and they will give you none, because it doesn’t exist. You’ll find out the truth of this case soon.”

            Tate, who has reportedly lived in Romania since 2017, was previously banned from various prominent social media platforms for expressing misogynistic views and hate speech. He has claimed there is “zero evidence” against him in the case and alleged it is instead a “political” attack to silence him.

            “My case is not criminal, it’s political. It’s not about justice or fairness. It’s about attacking my influence on the world,” read a post that appeared on his Twitter account on Sunday.

            His Twitter following has increased by several hundred thousand since he was first arrested in December. An online petition launched in January to free the brothers has garnered nearly 100,000 signatures.

            After the Tates and the two women were arrested, the DIICOT anti-organized crime agency said in a statement that it had identified six victims in the human trafficking case who were subjected to “acts of physical violence and mental coercion” and were sexually exploited by members of the alleged crime group.

            The agency said victims were lured with pretenses of love, and later intimidated, placed under surveillance and subjected to other control tactics while being coerced into engaging in pornographic acts for substantial financial gain.

            Last month, Romanian authorities descended on a compound near Bucharest linked with the Tate brothers and towed away a fleet of luxury cars that included a Rolls-Royce, a Ferrari and a Porsche. They reported seizing assets worth an estimated $3.9 million.

            Prosecutors have said that if they can prove the cars’ owners gained money through illicit activities such as human trafficking, the assets would be used to cover the expenses of the investigation and to compensate victims. Tate also unsuccessfully appealed the asset seizure.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797086,Radioactive capsule that fell off truck found in Australia,"PERTH, Australia (AP) — Authorities in Western Australia on Wednesday recovered a tiny but dangerous radioactive capsule that fell off a truck while being transported along a 1,400-kilometer (870-mile) Outback highway last month in what an official said was like finding the needle in the haystack. 

            Officials said the capsule the size of a pea was found south of the mining town of Newman on the Great Northern Highway. It was detected by a search vehicle travelling at 70 kilometers (43 miles) per hour when specialist equipment picked up radiation emitting from the capsule.

            Portable search equipment was then used to locate it 2 meters (6.5 feet) from the side of the road.











            “This is an extraordinary result ... they have quite literally found the needle in the haystack,” said Emergency Services Minister Stephen Dawson. 

            Chief Health Officer Andy Robertson said the capsule did not appear to have moved and no injuries had been reported.

            It contains the caesium 137 ceramic source, commonly used in radiation gauges, which emits dangerous amounts of radiation, equivalent of receiving 10 X-rays in an hour. It could cause skin burns and prolonged exposure could cause cancer. 

            Search crews had spent six days scouring the entire length of the highway. 

            The capsule measures 8 millimeters by 6 millimeters (0.31 inches by 0.24 inches), and people have been warned it could have unknowingly become lodged in their car’s tires.

            A government investigation has been launched into how the capsule fell off the truck and a report will be provided to the health minister.

            Defense officials were verifying the identification of the capsule, which has been placed into a lead container for safety. It will be stored in a secure location in Newman before being transported to a health facility in the city of Perth. 

            The capsule got lost while being transported between a desert mine site and Perth on Jan. 10. The truck transporting the capsule arrived at a Perth depot on Jan. 16. Emergency services were notified of the missing capsule on Jan. 25.

            The chief executive of the mining giant Rio Tinto Iron Ore, Simon Trott, has apologized for the incident and expressed gratitude for the find.

            “A pretty incredible recovery when you think of the distances involved, and also the remoteness of the terrain, and I think that really speaks to the tenacity of all those who were involved in the search,” Trott said.

            “The simple fact is this device should never have been lost. We’re sorry that that has occurred and we’re sorry for the concern that that has caused within the Western Australian community,” Trott added.

            Robertson said the investigation of the mishap could lead to a prosecution.

            “We have the ability to prosecute under the Radiation Safety Act and we will certainly look at such prosecutions, and we’ve done that in the past,” Robertson said.

            Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said a 1,000 Australian dollar ($708) fine was an inadequate maximum penalty for mishandling radioactive material.

            “It shouldn’t have been lost, that’s the first thing. And second, yeah of course that figure is ridiculously low,” Albanese said.

            Dawson said the state government was reviewing the penalties under the Radiation Safety Act.PERTH, Australia (AP) — Authorities in Western Australia on Wednesday recovered a tiny but dangerous radioactive capsule that fell off a truck while being transported along a 1,400-kilometer (870-mile) Outback highway last month in what an official said was like finding the needle in the haystack.Officials said the capsule the size of a pea was found south of the mining town of Newman on the Great Northern Highway.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797112,Day of disruption in UK as hundreds of thousands join strike,"LONDON (AP) — Thousands of schools in the U.K. closed some or all of their classrooms, train services were paralyzed and delays were expected at airports on the biggest day of industrial action Britain has seen in more than a decade, as unions stepped up pressure on the government Wednesday to provide better pay amid a cost-of-living crisis. 

            The Trades Union Congress, a federation of unions, estimated that up to a half-million workers, including teachers, university staff, civil servants, border officials and train drivers, went on strike across the country.

            More walkouts, including by nurses and ambulance workers, are planned for the coming days and weeks.











            Months of strikes have disrupted the daily routines of Britons as a bitter dispute between unions and the government over pay and working conditions drags on. The simultaneous strikes across multiple industries on Wednesday marked an escalation of the unions' protest actions. 

            The last time the country saw mass walkouts on this scale was in 2011, when well over 1 million public sector workers staged a one-day strike in a dispute over pensions. Others on strike Wednesday ranged from museum workers and London bus drivers to coast guard personnel and officers who staff passport booths at airports. The British Museum was closed Wednesday because of the strikes.

            Union bosses argue that despite some pay increases, such as a 5% offer the government proposed to teachers, the U.K.'s soaring inflation has plunged scores of public sector workers into financial difficulty because their wages have failed to keep pace. Teachers, health workers and many others say their wages have fallen in real terms over the last decade, and the surge in living costs that began last year exacerbated the problem.

            The Trades Union Congress, or TUC, said Wednesday that the average public sector worker is 203 pounds ($250) a month worse off compared with 2010, once inflation is taken into account.

            Inflation in the U.K. stands at 10.5%, the highest in 40 years, driven by skyrocketing food and energy costs. While some expect price increases to slow this year, Britain’s economic outlook remains grim. On Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund said the country will be the only major economy to contract this year, performing even worse than sanctions-hit Russia.

            The National Education Union said some 23,000 schools would be affected Wednesday, with an estimated 85% fully or partially closed. 

            “The government have been running down our education (system), underfunding our schools and underpaying the people who work in them,” Kevin Courtney, the NEU's joint general secretary, said. “Primary schools where you can’t find special needs assistants, because they’re taking jobs in supermarkets where they are paid better. That's what's making people take action.”

            Prime Minister Rishi Sunak told lawmakers that teacher strikes were “wrong,"" and claimed his government had already given teachers their biggest pay raise in 30 years.

            “Our children’s education is precious, and they deserve to be in school today,” he said.

            His office argued that pay increases for public sector workers would not be affordable for taxpayers and could lead to tax hikes, more government borrowing or spending cuts elsewhere. 

            Union leaders blame the government for refusing to negotiate and offer enough to halt the strikes. 

            Workers were also angered by the government's plan to introduce a new law aiming to curb strike disruptions by enforcing minimum service levels in key sectors, including health and transportation. Unions have criticized the legislation as an attack on the right to strike

            Lawmakers backed the bill on Monday. Thousands of people turned out in London, Manchester and other cities Wednesday to protest the proposal.

            TUC General Secretary Paul Nowak said industrial unrest would continue until the government puts an acceptable pay offer on the table.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797113,Pope consoles Congolese victims: 'Your pain is my pain',"KINSHASA, Congo (AP) — Pope Francis on Wednesday urged Congo’s people to forgive those who committed “inhuman violence” against them, celebrating a Mass for 1 million people and then hearing firsthand of the atrocities some of them have endured: a teenage girl “raped like an animal” for months; a young man who watched as his father was decapitated; a former sex slave who was forced into cannibalism.

            Congolese from the country’s violence-wracked east traveled to the capital of Kinshasa to tell the pope of the horrific violence they suffered for years as rebel groups sought to gain territory in the mineral-rich region through attacks that have forced more than 5 million people to flee their homes. 

            Francis sat in silence as victim after victim came forward to tell their stories. He watched as they offered up at the foot of a crucifix a symbol of their pain: the machete used to maim and kill, or the straw bed mat on which they had been raped. When they knelt in front of him for a blessing, Francis placed his hand on their heads, or on the stumps of the arms that remained.











            “Your tears are my tears; your pain is my pain,” Francis told them. “To every family that grieves or is displaced by the burning of villages and other war crimes, to the survivors of sexual violence and to every injured child and adult, I say: I am with you; I want to bring you God’s caress.”

            The intimate encounter at the Vatican Embassy in Kinshasa was an extraordinary moment of a pastor seeking to console his flock, and of a pope seeking to shine a spotlight on what Francis has called a “forgotten genocide” that barely makes the news. Despite being home to one of the largest U.N. peacekeeping operation in the world, eastern Congo has been mired in violence since the early 1990s as rebels and miliitas vie for control of mineral-rich territory. 

            “What a scandal and what hypocrisy, as people are being raped and killed, while the commerce that causes this violence and death continues to flourish!” Francis said of the foreign powers and extraction industries that are exploiting Congo's east. “Enough!”

            Francis had originally planned to visit the eastern province of North Kivu, where rebel groups have intensified attacks in the past year, when his trip was initially scheduled for July. 

            But after the trip was rescheduled, the Vatican had to cancel the visit to Goma due to the fighting that has forced some 5.7 million people to flee their homes, exacerbating a humanitarian crisis in Congo, where already some 26.4 million people face hunger, according to the World Food Program.

            Instead, residents of the east came to Francis, and their testimony was gut-wrenching.

            Ladislas Kambale Kombi, from the Beni area of eastern North Kivu province, told Francis of watching as men in military uniforms decapitated his father, placed his head in a basket and then took off with his mother, whom he never saw again.

            “At night, I cannot sleep,” he said. “It is hard to understand such wickedness, such near-animal-like brutality.”

            Bijoux Makumbi Kamala, 17, told of being kidnapped in 2020 by rebels in Walikale, in North Kivu province as she went to fetch water. Speaking through a translator, she said she was raped daily by the commander “like an animal,” until she escaped after 19 months.

            “It was useless to scream, because no one could hear me or come to my rescue,” she said, adding that she gave birth to twin girls “who will never know their father” and found consolation through services offered by the Catholic Church.

            The Associated Press usually does not identify victims of sexual violence, but those who told their stories to Francis gave their names in public at the start of their testimony.

            Emelda M’karhungulu, from a village near Bukavu in Congo’s South Kivu province, spoke through a translator of having been kept as a sexual slave for three months at age 16 by armed men who invaded her village in 2005. She said she was raped daily by five to 10 men who then forced their captives to eat the flesh of the men they had killed, mixed with animal meat and maize paste.

            “That was our food each day; whoever refused they would behead and would feed them to us,” she said. M’karhungulu said she eventually escaped one day when fetching water.

            While forced cannibalism is not known to be widespread, the United Nations and human rights groups documented how it was used as a weapon of war in the early 2000s in parts of eastern Congo.

            A statement prepared months ago by Désiré Dhetsina was read aloud on his behalf; Dhetsina disappeared after surviving an attack Feb. 1, 2022, on a camp for internally displaced people in Ituri province, on Congo’s northeastern border with Uganda.

            “I saw savagery: People carved up like meat in a butcher shop; women disemboweled, men decapitated,” Dhetsina reported. As his story was read to Francis, two woman stood up in front of the pope and raised into the air the stumps that remained of their mutilated arms.

            Francis condemned the violence and urged the Congolese victims to use their pain for good, to sow peace and reconciliation. It was a message he also delivered earlier in the day at a Mass to the throngs at Kinshasa’s Ndolo airport, where he cited the example of Christ who forgave those who betrayed him.

            “He showed them his wounds because forgiveness is born from wounds,” Francis said. “It is born when our wounds do not leave scars of hatred, but become the means by which we make room for others and accept their weaknesses. Our weakness becomes an opportunity, and forgiveness becomes the path to peace.”

            Roughly half of Congo’s 105 million people are Catholic, according to the Vatican, which also estimated that 1 million people were on hand for Francis’ Mass, citing local organizers. 

            Among the faithful was Clément Konde, who traveled from Kisantu, a town in the province of Central Kongo, more than 150 kilometers (95 miles) from Kinshasa. He planned to participate in all of Francis’ events this week before the pontiff heads to South Sudan, the second leg of his African journey.

            “To my children and to the children who stayed in my city, I will bring them the message of the Holy Father, the message of peace and reconciliation,” Konde said.

            Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc. The AP is solely responsible for this content.KINSHASA, Congo (AP) — Pope Francis on Wednesday urged Congo’s people to forgive those who committed “inhuman violence” against them, celebrating a Mass for 1 million people and then hearing firsthand of the atrocities some of them have endured: a teenage girl “raped like an animal” for months; a young man who watched as his father was decapitated; a former sex slave who was forced into cannibalism.Congolese from the country’s violence-wracked east traveled to the capital of Kinshasa to tell the pope of the horrific violence they suffered for years as rebel groups sought to gain territory in the mineral-rich region through attacks that have forced more than 5 million people to flee their homes.Francis sat in silence as victim after victim came forward to tell their stories. He watched as they offered up at the foot of a crucifix a symbol of their pain: the machete used to maim and kill, or the straw bed mat on which they had been raped. When they knelt in front of him for a blessing, Francis placed his hand on their heads, or on the stumps of the arms that remained.“Your tears are my tears; your pain is my pain,” Francis told them. “To every family that grieves or is displaced by the burning of villages and other war crimes, to the survivors of sexual violence and to every injured child and adult, I say: I am with you; I want to bring you God’s caress.”The intimate encounter at the Vatican Embassy in Kinshasa was an extraordinary moment of a pastor seeking to console his flock, and of a pope seeking to shine a spotlight on what Francis has called a “forgotten genocide” that barely makes the news. Despite being home to one of the largest U.N. peacekeeping operation in the world, eastern Congo has been mired in violence since the early 1990s as rebels and miliitas vie for control of mineral-rich territory.“What a scandal and what hypocrisy, as people are being raped and killed, while the commerce that causes this violence and death continues to flourish!” Francis said of the foreign powers and extraction industries that are exploiting Congo's east. “Enough!”Francis had originally planned to visit the eastern province of North Kivu, where rebel groups have intensified attacks in the past year, when his trip was initially scheduled for July.But after the trip was rescheduled, the Vatican had to cancel the visit to Goma due to the fighting that has forced some 5.7 million people to flee their homes, exacerbating a humanitarian crisis in Congo, where already some 26.4 million people face hunger, according to the World Food Program.Instead, residents of the east came to Francis, and their testimony was gut-wrenching.Ladislas Kambale Kombi, from the Beni area of eastern North Kivu province, told Francis of watching as men in military uniforms decapitated his father, placed his head in a basket and then took off with his mother, whom he never saw again.“At night, I cannot sleep,” he said. “It is hard to understand such wickedness, such near-animal-like brutality.”Bijoux Makumbi Kamala, 17, told of being kidnapped in 2020 by rebels in Walikale, in North Kivu province as she went to fetch water. Speaking through a translator, she said she was raped daily by the commander “like an animal,” until she escaped after 19 months.“It was useless to scream, because no one could hear me or come to my rescue,” she said, adding that she gave birth to twin girls “who will never know their father” and found consolation through services offered by the Catholic Church.The Associated Press usually does not identify victims of sexual violence, but those who told their stories to Francis gave their names in public at the start of their testimony.Emelda M’karhungulu, from a village near Bukavu in Congo’s South Kivu province, spoke through a translator of having been kept as a sexual slave for three months at age 16 by armed men who invaded her village in 2005. She said she was raped daily by five to 10 men who then forced their captives to eat the flesh of the men they had killed, mixed with animal meat and maize paste.“That was our food each day; whoever refused they would behead and would feed them to us,” she said. M’karhungulu said she eventually escaped one day when fetching water.While forced cannibalism is not known to be widespread, the United Nations and human rights groups documented how it was used as a weapon of war in the early 2000s in parts of eastern Congo.A statement prepared months ago by Désiré Dhetsina was read aloud on his behalf; Dhetsina disappeared after surviving an attack Feb. 1, 2022, on a camp for internally displaced people in Ituri province, on Congo’s northeastern border with Uganda.“I saw savagery: People carved up like meat in a butcher shop; women disemboweled, men decapitated,” Dhetsina reported.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797114,"Ozzy Osbourne cancels 2023 European tour dates, cites injury","Hard rock legend Ozzy Osbourne announced the cancellation of his 2023 tour dates in the U.K. and continental Europe.

            Osbourne issued a statement early Wednesday saying damage to his spine suffered in an accident four years ago will prevent him from touring.

            “I am honestly humbled by the way you’ve all patiently held onto your tickets for all this time, but in all good conscience, I have now come to the realization that I’m not physically capable of doing my upcoming European/UK tour dates, as I know I couldn’t deal with the travel required,"" Osbourne said.











            The 74-year-old Grammy winner and former vocalist for the metal band Black Sabbath said “my singing voice is fine” but said he remained physically weak following three operations, stem cell treatments, physical therapy and Hybrid Assistive Limb treatment, which uses a robotic exoskeleton to help improve movement and balance.

            He thanked his family, fans, band and crew members and fellow metal pioneers Judas Priest.

            “Never would I have imagined that my touring days would have ended this way,"" Osbourne said. ""My team is currently coming up with ideas for where I will be able to perform without having to travel from city to city and country to country.”

            Ticket refunds will be available at the point of purchase, the statement said.

            Osbourne previously cancelled tour dates in Europe and North America in 2019 due to health problems, including a “bad fall” in which he said he injured vertebrae in his neck. 

            The singer, who enjoyed solo success after leaving Black Sabbath, announced in 2020 that he had been diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease, a nervous system disorder that affects movement.

            Osbourne and the other three members of Black Sabbath were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006. Osbourne and his family, including his wife, Sharon, and two of his three children were the stars of their own reality show called “The Osbournes.”Hard rock legend Ozzy Osbourne announced the cancellation of his 2023 tour dates in the U.K. and continental Europe.Osbourne issued a statement early Wednesday saying damage to his spine suffered in an accident four years ago will prevent him from touring.“I am honestly humbled by the way you’ve all patiently held onto your tickets for all this time, but in all good conscience, I have now come to the realization that I’m not physically capable of doing my upcoming European/UK tour dates, as I know I couldn’t deal with the travel required,"" Osbourne said.The 74-year-old Grammy winner and former vocalist for the metal band Black Sabbath said “my singing voice is fine” but said he remained physically weak following three operations, stem cell treatments, physical therapy and Hybrid Assistive Limb treatment, which uses a robotic exoskeleton to help improve movement and balance.He thanked his family, fans, band and crew members and fellow metal pioneers Judas Priest.“Never would I have imagined that my touring days would have ended this way,"" Osbourne said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797117,"Millennials expect holistic care with digital health, Bupa survey finds","70% of millennials interested in learning about health, despite multiple barriers

HONG KONG SAR -  Media OutReach - 1 February 2023 - Healthcare providers, insurers, and other members of the healthcare industry can focus on three aspects pointing to millennials' distinctive experiences and expectations, providing healthcare that is holistic, interactive and engaging, and digital. According to a survey by Bupa, 70% of millennials are interested in learning more about how to maintain health, multiple barriers stand in their way.   A study by Bupa in Hong Kong surveying 500 Hong Kong millennials found that the biggest obstacle to maintaining a healthy lifestyle is not having enough time, cited by 53% of survey respondents. The second biggest barrier is too much stress (48%). And, perhaps unsurprising for the generation that pioneered on-demand entertainment, one in three Hong Kong millennials (33%) say that they don't prioritize a healthy lifestyle because it's simply too boring.   Millennials are different than the previous generation, viewing health as a holistic pursuit encompassing multiple aspects of physical, mental and emotional wellness. At the same time, millennials are pursuing career aspirations and caring for aging parents, while starting families of their own. Millennials are also getting older - some are already facing chronic health conditions. For others, the risk will only increase with age.   ""Millennials represent a core subset of the Hong Kong population. Getting millennials to start on healthy habits today will be vital to help them stay well in the coming decades,"" said Andrew Merrilees, Managing Director, Bupa Hong Kong. ""In order to design a wellness approach that works for this generation, healthcare providers, insurers, and the healthcare industry need to understand what matters most to millennials. Millennials are a generation of digital natives, famous for blazing new trails and transforming the ways we communicate, work, and experience the world.""   Healthcare providers have a mandate to be more holistic in their offerings to millennials. Hong Kong millennials see wellness as encompassing multiple aspects of their lifestyle: from regular exercise, to a balanced diet, to high-quality sleep. Mental health is just as important as physical health, and many millennials also consider the health of the world beyond themselves. They also concerned about the wellbeing of their community and the natural environment, too. This sets millennials apart from the previous generation, who are more likely to see health as simply being free from illness.     Millennials invented the world we know today; a world of on-demand information, entertainment and communication. They are accustomed to the social media interface and expect the services offered to them to be cross-platform, personalised, and perhaps most important—fun. In this context, it's time for solutions that promote interactive healthcare engagement and learning, rather than just pushing out general medical information which could apply to anyone. When millennials feel catered to on an individual level, they will be more encouraged to take the steering wheel and start down the road to a healthier lifestyle—especially if there are enticing goal-oriented rewards to encourage even more positive progress.   Millennials need an ecosystem of wellbeing solutions which work together and are synced across platforms. Examples of this include virtual doctor appointments, easy-to-use patient portals, and personalised data repositories that give patients faster access to their healthcare information. Bringing wellbeing to the digital ecosystem will be even more important as millennials continue to age and find more chronic healthcare needs, which is why Quality HealthCare Medical Services Limited (QHMS) recently launched its DigiHealth Point to centralise remote healthcare services and optimise the ""Prediction, Prevention and Treatment"" approach to chronic disease management.   The future of healthcare is already being defined by the needs of millennials today. It is a generation full of health-conscious people, who will gladly admit to needing additional support to bring their wellness to the next level. Now is the right moment for more services and solutions to support millennials in overcoming their healthcare barriers and discovering a brighter, healthier future ahead.  Hashtag: #Bupa

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797137,South Korean court says stolen statue must return to Japan,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — A South Korean court ruled Wednesday that a 14th century Korean Buddhist statue should be sent back to a Japanese temple from where it was stolen in 2012.

            The statue’s return had been put on hold for years after a South Korean temple claimed ownership of it, insisting that it was likely looted by medieval Japanese pirates before it ended up at a temple on Tsushima island, presumably in 1527.

            The South Korean temple is likely to appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court. 











            Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno said his government will encourage Seoul to facilitate the statue’s swift return to Japan. 

            The 50-centimeter (20-inch) gilt bronze Buddha statue was one of two stolen from Tsushima’s Kannonji temple by thieves who attempted to sell them in South Korea.

            South Korea’s government returned the other statue to the temple soon after police recovered the items from the thieves, who were arrested and prosecuted.

            But Buseoksa temple in the western coastal city of Seosan filed a lawsuit to prevent the government from sending back the other statue, saying Buseoksa is the rightful owner. Korean historical records indicate that the statue, which is being kept at a state research institute in the central city of Daejeon, was created about 1330 to be enshrined at Buseoksa.

            The Daejeon District Court ruled in 2017 that the government should return the statue to Buseoksa, saying it was likely taken to Japan through theft or pillage.

            But the Daejeon High Court overturned the ruling on Wednesday, saying Japan's Kannonji had acquired legal ownership of the statue through continuous possession.

            Under Japanese civil law, a person or entity may acquire ownership of a property that didn't originally belong to them if they possess it “peacefully and openly” for at least 20 years. This means that Kannonji has been the statue’s legal owner since 1973 because it listed itself as a legal entity in 1953, the Daejeon High Court ruled.

            The court also said it is difficult to establish whether the current Buseoksa temple should fully inherit the rights of the temple that originally possessed the statute in the 14th century despite sharing the same name, citing a lack of documents proving a succession in religious identity, organizational structure and property.

            Buseoksa’s representatives criticized the ruling and said they will discuss with their lawyers whether to appeal to the Supreme Court. 

            “We likely need to appeal as today’s ruling was hard to understand and lacked legal logic,” said Lee Sang-geun, who heads a committee of Buddhist leaders and civic activists pushing for the statue's return to Buseoksa.

            Sekko Tanaka, Kannonji's former head monk, welcomed the ruling but questioned why the case has dragged out for more than a decade when it was essentially about a “simple theft.” 

            “I’m grateful that the justice upheld our request,” he told Japan's TBS television. “I hope to see the statue returned to Kannonji as soon as possible.”

            Associated Press writer Mari Yamaguchi in Tokyo contributed to this report.SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — A South Korean court ruled Wednesday that a 14th century Korean Buddhist statue should be sent back to a Japanese temple from where it was stolen in 2012.The statue’s return had been put on hold for years after a South Korean temple claimed ownership of it, insisting that it was likely looted by medieval Japanese pirates before it ended up at a temple on Tsushima island, presumably in 1527.The South Korean temple is likely to appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court.Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno said his government will encourage Seoul to facilitate the statue’s swift return to Japan.The 50-centimeter (20-inch) gilt bronze Buddha statue was one of two stolen from Tsushima’s Kannonji temple by thieves who attempted to sell them in South Korea.South Korea’s government returned the other statue to the temple soon after police recovered the items from the thieves, who were arrested and prosecuted.But Buseoksa temple in the western coastal city of Seosan filed a lawsuit to prevent the government from sending back the other statue, saying Buseoksa is the rightful owner. Korean historical records indicate that the statue, which is being kept at a state research institute in the central city of Daejeon, was created about 1330 to be enshrined at Buseoksa.The Daejeon District Court ruled in 2017 that the government should return the statue to Buseoksa, saying it was likely taken to Japan through theft or pillage.But the Daejeon High Court overturned the ruling on Wednesday, saying Japan's Kannonji had acquired legal ownership of the statue through continuous possession.Under Japanese civil law, a person or entity may acquire ownership of a property that didn't originally belong to them if they possess it “peacefully and openly” for at least 20 years. This means that Kannonji has been the statue’s legal owner since 1973 because it listed itself as a legal entity in 1953, the Daejeon High Court ruled.The court also said it is difficult to establish whether the current Buseoksa temple should fully inherit the rights of the temple that originally possessed the statute in the 14th century despite sharing the same name, citing a lack of documents proving a succession in religious identity, organizational structure and property.Buseoksa’s representatives criticized the ruling and said they will discuss with their lawyers whether to appeal to the Supreme Court.“We likely need to appeal as today’s ruling was hard to understand and lacked legal logic,” said Lee Sang-geun, who heads a committee of Buddhist leaders and civic activists pushing for the statue's return to Buseoksa.Sekko Tanaka, Kannonji's former head monk, welcomed the ruling but questioned why the case has dragged out for more than a decade when it was essentially about a “simple theft.”“I’m grateful that the justice upheld our request,” he told Japan's TBS television. “I hope to see the statue returned to Kannonji as soon as possible.”___Associated Press writer Mari Yamaguchi in Tokyo contributed to this report.",2023/02/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797138,War's longest battle exacts high price in 'heart of Ukraine',"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Visitors used to browse through Bakhmut’s late 19th century buildings, enjoy walks in its rose-lined lakeside park and revel in the sparkling wines produced in historic underground caves. That was when the city in eastern Ukraine was a popular tourist destination.

            No more. The longest battle of Russia's war has turned this city of salt and gypsum mines into a ghost town. Despite bombing, shelling and attempts to encircle Bakhmut for six months, Russia's forces have not conquered it. 

            But their scorched-earth tactics have made it impossible for civilians to have any semblance of a life there.











            “It’s hell on earth right now; I can’t find enough words to describe it,” said Ukrainian soldier Petro Voloschenko, who is known on the battlefield as Stone, his voice rising with emotion and resentment. 

            Voloschenko, who is originally from Kyiv, arrived in the area in August when the Russian assault started and has since celebrated his birthday, Christmas and New Year’s there. 

            The 44-year-old saw the city, located around 100 kilometers (60 miles) from Russia’s border, gradually turned into a wasteland of ruins. Most of the houses are crushed, without roofs, ceilings, windows or doors, making them uninhabitable, he said.

            Out of a prewar population of 80,000, a few thousand residents remain. They rarely see daylight because they spend most of their time in basements sheltering from the ferocious fighting around and above them. The city constantly shudders with the muffled sound of explosions, the whizzing of mortars and a constant soundtrack of artillery. Anywhere is a potential target. 

            Bakhmut lies in Donetsk province, one of four that Russia illegally annexed in the fall — but Moscow only controls about half of it. To take the remaining half, Russian forces have no choice but to go through Bakhmut, which offers the only approach to bigger Ukrainian-held cities since Ukrainian troops took back Izium in Kharkiv province in September, according to Mykola Bielieskov, a research fellow at Ukraine’s National Institute for Strategic Studies.

            “Without seizure of these cities, the Russian army won’t be able to accomplish the political task it was given,” Bielieskov said.

            The deterioration in Bakhmut started during the summer after Russia took the last major city in neighboring Luhansk province. It then poured troops and equipment into capturing Bakhmut, and Ukraine did the same to defend it. For Russia, the city was one stepping stone toward its goal of seizing the remaining Ukrainian-held territory in Donetsk. 

            From trenches outside the city, the two sides dug in for what turned into an exhausting standoff as Ukraine clawed back territory to the north and south and Russian airstrikes across the country targeted power plants and other infrastructure. 

            The months of battle exhausted both armies. In the fall, Russia changed tactics and sent in foot soldiers instead of probing the front line mainly with artillery, according to Voloschenko. 

            Bielieskov, the research fellow, said the least-trained Russians go first to force the Ukrainians to open fire and expose the strengths and weaknesses of their defense. 

            More trained units or mercenaries from the Wagner Group, a private Russian military company led by a rogue millionaire and known for its brutality, make up the rear guard, Bielieskov said.

            Bielieskov said that Ukraine compensates for its lack of heavy equipment with people who are ready to stand to the last. 

            ""Lightly armed, without sufficient artillery support, which they cannot always be provided, they stand and hold off attacks as long as possible,” he said.

            The result is that the battle is believed to have produced horrific troop losses for both Ukraine and Russia. Quite how deadly isn’t known: Neither side is saying. 

            “Manpower is less of a Russian problem and, in some ways, more of a Ukrainian problem, not only because the casualties are painful, but they’re often ... Ukraine’s best troops,” said Lawrence Freedman, a professor emeritus of war studies at King’s College London.

            The Institute for the Study of War recently reported that Wagner forces have seen more than 4,100 die and 10,000 wounded, including over 1,000 killed between late November and early December near Bakhmut. The numbers are impossible to verify.

            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in a recent address, described the situation in Bakhmut as “very tough.”

            “These are constant Russian assaults. Constant attempts to break through our defenses” he said, 

            Like Mariupol — the port city in the same province that Russia eventually captured after an 82-day siege that eventually came down to a mammoth steel mill where determined Ukrainian fighters held out along with civilians — Bakhmut has taken on almost mythic importance to its defenders. 

            “Bakhmut has already become a symbol of Ukrainian invincibility,” Voloschenko said. “Bakhmut is the heart of Ukraine, and the future peace of those cities that are no longer under occupation depends on the rhythm with which it beats.”

            For now, Bakhmut remains completely under the control of the Ukrainian army, albeit more as a fortress than a place where people would visit, work or play. In January, the Russians seized the town of Soledar, located less than 20 kilometers (some 12 miles) away, but their advance is very slow, according to military analysts. 

            “These are rates of advancement that do not allow us to talk about serious offensive actions. It’s a slow pushing out at a very high price,” Bielieskov said. 

            Along the front line on the Ukrainian side, emergency medical units provide urgent care to battlefield casualties. From 50 to 170 wounded Ukrainian soldiers pass daily through just one of the several stabilization points along the Donetsk front line, according to Tetiana Ivanchenko, who has volunteered in eastern Ukraine since a Russia-backed separatist conflict started there in 2014.

            After its setbacks in Kharkiv in the northeast and Kherson province in the south, the Kremlin is hungry for any success, even if it is just seizing a town or two that have been pounded into rubble. Freedman, the King’s College London professor emeritus, said the loss of Bakhmut would be a blow for Ukraine and offer tactical advantages to Russian forces, but wouldn't prove decisive to the outcome of the war. 

            There would have been more value for Russia if it could have captured a populated and intact Bakhmut early on in the war, but now the capture would just give its forces options on how to seize more of Donetsk, said Freedman. 

            A 22-year-old Ukrainian soldier who is known as Desiatyi, or Tenth, joined the army on the day that Russia started the full-scale war in Ukraine. After months spent defending the Bakhmut area, losing many comrades, he said he has no regrets. 

            “It is not about comparing the price and losses on both sides. It’s about the fact that, yes, Ukrainians are dying, but they are dying because of a specific goal,” said Desiatyi, who did not give his real name for security reasons. 

            “Ukraine has no choice but to defend every inch of its land. The country must defend itself, especially now, so zealously, so firmly, and desperately. This is what will help us liberate our occupied territories in the future.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797139,German beer sales up in 2022 after COVID pushed them down,"BERLIN (AP) — German beer sales rose in 2022 after COVID-19 restrictions weighed on brewers in the previous two years, but the long-term trend remains downward and the World Cup soccer tournament in Qatar didn't get the taps flowing, according to official figures released Wednesday.

            The Federal Statistical Office said that German-based breweries and distributors sold about 8.8 billion liters (2.3 billion gallons) of beer last year, a 2.7% increase compared with 2021.

            Beer sales inside Germany — more than four-fifths of the total — were up 4% to 7.2 billion liters (1.9 billion gallons). That was still 5% lower than in 2019, the last year before the pandemic.











            Exports were down overall. While German brewers shipped around 805 million liters (213 million gallons) of beer to other nations in the European Union, a 7.8% increase, exports to other countries dropped 12.4% to about 716 million liters (189 million gallons).

            Big events such as the World Cup have given beer sales a bounce when held in summer in previous years, but last year's tournament — which, unusually, was held as winter started in Europe — largely failed to do so, the statistics office said.

            While last year pointed to something of a recovery after lockdowns that shut restaurants and bars for periods in 2020 and 2021, German brewers have been struggling with a longer-term downward trend fueled by health concerns and other factors.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797155,Austria's far-right Freedom Party regains national momentum,"BERLIN (AP) — Nearly four years ago, Austria’s populist far-right Freedom Party was ousted from the national coalition government over a major corruption scandal, and voters punished it at the ballot box.

            But the party’s nearly double-digit gains in Sunday’s regional election in the province of Lower Austria confirmed a political trend on the national level. In recent months, the Freedom Party has regained its previous momentum — and, according to recent polls, is now the strongest party in the small Alpine nation.

            In Lower Austria it won 24.2% of the vote, up 9.4 percentage points from the last state-level election in 2018. The conservative People’s Party, meanwhile, which leads the national government, lost its long-held absolute majority in the region and dropped 9.7 percentage points to 39.9%.











            Nationally, the Freedom Party’s growth is even more pronounced. The party has led national polls since this fall, averaging around 27% in most surveys ahead of the center-left Social Democrats with around 25% and the People's Party at around 21%.

            Founded in the 1950s, the Freedom Party was led by former Nazis in the postwar period. It adopted the populist, nativist right-wing rhetoric it’s known for today in the 1980s under its charismatic former leader, Joerg Haider. It became one of the first and most successful populist right-wing parties in Europe and has served in Austria's governing coalition twice, in the early 2000s and from 2017 to 2019.

            Experts say the party has managed these gains by applying its populist, Austria-first rhetoric to the various crises hitting Europe in recent months and years. Its leaders criticize European Union sanctions against Russia, stress the impact of inflation and rising energy prices, express skepticism about vaccines and pandemic-related restrictions, and hold hardline positions on migration.

            “You have two issues where the (Freedom Party) ... distinguishes itself from all other parties: the coronavirus and the Ukraine war,” said Laurenz Ennser-Jedenastik, a political scientist at the University of Vienna. “And then there’s the return of the migration issue, where the (Freedom Party) is also most favorably positioned to reap all the benefits.”

            “I think those are all the ingredients you need for a pretty good electoral result,” he added.

            The far-right party has also benefited from the troubles of Austria’s other major parties. The governing People’s Party, in particular, has been embroiled in a long-standing corruption scandal that has made the Freedom Party’s own past issues with graft less salient.

            “The Freedom Party always advances or reaches larger groups of voters when there’s a thematic and personality vacuum in the two traditional parties, the People’s Party and the Social Democrats,” said Peter Hajek, a Vienna-based pollster.

            Back in 2017, the Freedom Party won nearly 26% in parliamentary elections and became the junior governing partner of the People’s Party under then-Chancellor Sebastian Kurz.

            But in May 2019, secret video recordings emerged of the Freedom Party’s leader appearing to offer favors to a purported Russian investor in a villa on the Spanish island of Ibiza. The so-called “Ibiza affair” brought down the governing coalition and triggered elections in which the Freedom Party dropped to 16%.

            After that, the People’s Party formed a coalition with the Greens, a government that has been in place since early 2020.

            Since then, however, the Freedom Party’s rhetoric on the pandemic, Ukraine and migration has helped it appeal to those who supported in the past, slowly but steadily regaining its previous position in the polls.

            What’s more, ongoing allegations of corruption within the governing People’s Party have brought many previously disaffected voters back to the Freedom Party.

            In 2021, Kurz resigned after he became the central figure in a corruption probe. Since then, investigators have released a steady trickle of revelations about Kurz and his close allies, which continues to harm the image of Chancellor Karl Nehammer and the rest of the People's Party.

            “Now there are voters from the conservative camp who are disappointed because they feel betrayed” by the People’s Party, Hajek said.

            The Freedom Party's own past scandals didn't seem to bother Lower Austria voters on Sunday. Its top candidate, Udo Landbauer, had resigned his post in 2018 over his ties to a far-right fraternity that used an antisemitic songbook.

            Whether it can maintain its current strength until Austria’s next elections, currently slated for 2024, remains to be seen. If it does, it could join other far-right parties around Europe, including the Brothers of Italy and the Sweden Democrats, in gaining — or, in the Freedom Party’s case, regaining — greater influence.

            Hajek, the pollster, said the Freedom Party’s position feels like the latest iteration in an electoral pattern for the party: “It happens every 10 or 15 years: the rise of the Freedom Party, the peak, the fall; the rise, the peak, the fall,” he said. “It’s always the same.”BERLIN (AP) — Nearly four years ago, Austria’s populist far-right Freedom Party was ousted from the national coalition government over a major corruption scandal, and voters punished it at the ballot box.But the party’s nearly double-digit gains in Sunday’s regional election in the province of Lower Austria confirmed a political trend on the national level.

The so-called “Ibiza affair” brought down the governing coalition and triggered elections in which the Freedom Party dropped to 16%.After that, the People’s Party formed a coalition with the Greens, a government that has been in place since early 2020.Since then, however, the Freedom Party’s rhetoric on the pandemic, Ukraine and migration has helped it appeal to those who supported in the past, slowly but steadily regaining its previous position in the polls.What’s more, ongoing allegations of corruption within the governing People’s Party have brought many previously disaffected voters back to the Freedom Party.In 2021, Kurz resigned after he became the central figure in a corruption probe. Since then, investigators have released a steady trickle of revelations about Kurz and his close allies, which continues to harm the image of Chancellor Karl Nehammer and the rest of the People's Party.“Now there are voters from the conservative camp who are disappointed because they feel betrayed” by the People’s Party, Hajek said.The Freedom Party's own past scandals didn't seem to bother Lower Austria voters on Sunday. Its top candidate, Udo Landbauer, had resigned his post in 2018 over his ties to a far-right fraternity that used an antisemitic songbook.Whether it can maintain its current strength until Austria’s next elections, currently slated for 2024, remains to be seen. If it does, it could join other far-right parties around Europe, including the Brothers of Italy and the Sweden Democrats, in gaining — or, in the Freedom Party’s case, regaining — greater influence.Hajek, the pollster, said the Freedom Party’s position feels like the latest iteration in an electoral pattern for the party: “It happens every 10 or 15 years: the rise of the Freedom Party, the peak, the fall; the rise, the peak, the fall,” he said. “It’s always the same.”",2023/02/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797156,India to raise spending on job creation ahead of election,"NEW DELHI (AP) — Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government presented to Parliament on Wednesday an annual budget of $550 billion that calls for ramping up capital spending by 33% to spur economic growth and create jobs ahead of a general election next year. 

            Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said private investment was rising after the pandemic and the government should focus on driving growth. 

            India’s economy is projected to grow 7% in the fiscal year ending in March. The government forecasts growth of 6%-6.5% next year. 











            The country's population is expected to overtake China's in size this year, and its economy last year surpassed that of the United Kingdom to become the world's fifth largest. 

            But despite steady economic growth, the Modi government has struggled to quash unemployment concerns and is under pressure to generate enough jobs, especially as it faces key state polls this year and a general election in 2024, which it is favored to win. 

            “The budget makes the need once again to ramp up the virtuous cycle of investment and job creation,” Sitharaman said. 

            According to the Center for Monitoring Indian Economy, the unemployment rate stood at 8.3% in December, up from 6.5% in January 2022. 

            The government is aiming for a budget deficit of 5.9% of India's gross domestic product for the 2023-24 financial year, lower than the 6.4% for this fiscal year. 

            Despite worries that the world economy is headed for a slump, the finance minister she was confident the country's future was bright. “India is on the right track,” she said. 

            Apart from raising capital spending on construction of schools, airports, heliports and other infrastructure to $122 billion, the budget extended a $24 billion scheme to provide free grains to vulnerable households for one year. 

            The government will also increase by 66% its spending on providing affordable housing to the urban poor, Sitharaman said, and prioritize “green growth” with a $4.3 billion investment towards helping India meet its goal of going carbon neutral by 2070. 

            The budget also announced new tax relief measures aimed at bringing some respite for India's large middle class. But it slashed spending by 30% on India's rural jobs program, a boon for the country's most vulnerable, triggering criticism from activists and the opposition. 

            On Wednesday, Modi praised the budget as laying a strong “foundation for the aspirations and resolutions of a developed India,"" and said the government's investment into infrastructure has increased by more than 400% since 2014 when he first became prime minister. 

            Sitharaman's budget speech was briefly interrupted by opposition lawmakers chanting “Adani, Adani,” after a tussle between Indian billionaire Gautam Adani and a U.S.-based short-seller dominated headlines this week. 

            Political opponents have urged India's market regulator to investigate Adani after the short-selling firm accused his conglomerate of stock market manipulation and accounting fraud. The allegations led investors to dump Adani-related shares, wiping out tens of billions of dollars worth of market value for his business empire. 

            Critics of the 60-year-old billionaire say his rise has been boosted by his apparent close ties to Modi. The Adani Group has denied the allegations.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797157,Polish leader donates to Ukraine army to end defamation case,"WARSAW, Poland (AP) — The Polish ruling party leader, Jarosław Kaczyński, has paid 50,000 zlotys ($11,500) for the needs of the Ukrainian army to settle a defamation case with a political rival.

            Kaczyński was ordered by a court in December to pay Radek Sikorski more than 700,000 zlotys ($162,000) to cover the costs of publishing an apology for calling him a “diplomatic traitor.”

            Kaczyński made the comment in 2016 in connection to the 2010 plane crash near Smolensk, Russia, that killed Kaczynski’s twin brother, then-President Lech Kaczyński, and 95 others. Sikorski was foreign minister at the time of the disaster and is now a member of the European Parliament and an outspoken government critic. 











            Sikorski belongs to Civic Platform, a party that has been in opposition since 2015. Kaczyński has long accused Civic Platform leaders of having a role in his brother's death, a claim not substantiated by investigations to date.

            Kaczyński said the court's penalty was so high that he would have to sell his house to pay it, and that even then he might not have enough. 

            Sikorski replied by saying he believed “that the penalties for defamation should be severe but not ruinous.” He said if Kaczyński paid 50,000 zlotys for Ukraine's armed forces he would refrain from demanding an apology.

            Kaczynski said in a statement on Tuesday that he had paid the money.

            “Today Ukraine is fighting for its independence and freedom, but also for our security. We support it and we will support it. Since the payment to support the fund for the Ukrainian Armed Forces closes my controversial dispute with Sikorski, I do so with satisfaction,” Kaczyński said in a statement published on Twitter.

            Sikorski said he accepted that form of apology, adding “I'm glad we found a patriotic solution.”WARSAW, Poland (AP) — The Polish ruling party leader, Jarosław Kaczyński, has paid 50,000 zlotys ($11,500) for the needs of the Ukrainian army to settle a defamation case with a political rival.Kaczyński was ordered by a court in December to pay Radek Sikorski more than 700,000 zlotys ($162,000) to cover the costs of publishing an apology for calling him a “diplomatic traitor.”Kaczyński made the comment in 2016 in connection to the 2010 plane crash near Smolensk, Russia, that killed Kaczynski’s twin brother, then-President Lech Kaczyński, and 95 others.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797183,India's finance minister announces new clean energy funds,"BENGALURU, India (AP) — Indian finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced several new clean energy initiatives in the government's annual federal budget speech on Wednesday, saying “green growth” is a top priority for the country.

            More than $8 billion dollars were announced for projects like mangrove restoration which help suck carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, converting waste into biogas and speeding up renewable energy initiatives. But details of how the funds will be spent are yet to be disclosed.

            The minister said the injection of 35,000 crore rupees ($4.3 billion) into India's energy transition will be channeled through the ministry of petroleum and natural gas to help India reach its goal of net zero emissions by 2070. India is currently the world's third highest-emitting nation.











            The new funds form part of the government's $550 billion budget aimed at ramping up spending to spur economic growth and create jobs ahead of the general election next year. Sitharaman mentioned the scaling up of clean energy for the economy and jobs within the first few minutes of her speech.

            Sitharaman also proposed government incentives for energy storage systems in India that would aid round-the-clock renewable energy use and announced a new framework for pumped storage systems for hydropower.

            She set out an additional 20,700 crore rupees ($ 2.5 billion) to facilitate new clean energy production in the Himalayan region of Ladakh, where electricity grid infrastructure remains a key sticking point. 

            Other programs to incentivize the use of alternative, less-polluting fertilizers and to cut down on chemical fertilizers were also announced, but details of how much will be spent were unclear.

            Import taxes for components required to produce lithium-ion batteries, a key component in many electric vehicles, will be slashed, Sitharaman said. But no exemption was provided for protective taxes in the solar power sector. 

            The budget will now be debated by both houses of parliament before it can be enacted, which is likely to happen as Modi’s party holds a strong majority.

            The move toward clean energy and away from fossil fuels has increasingly become a priority for India and nations around the world as countries try and limit global warming.

            India's government recently announced a green hydrogen initiative for clean fuel and a climate action program to encourage more sustainable lifestyles. But the country is still heavily dependent on planet-warming coal burning for its energy needs.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797184,Republican-led committee targets COVID relief aid for review,"WASHINGTON (AP) — House Republicans on Wednesday began their promised aggressive oversight of the Biden administration, focusing on what watchdogs described as “indications of widespread fraud” in federal coronavirus aid programs initiated under President Donald Trump.

            GOP lawmakers complained that too little attention was paid to the problems when Democrats controlled Congress. Democrats blamed the Trump administration for much of the mess.

            More than 1,000 people have pleaded guilty or have been convicted on federal charges of defrauding the myriad COVID-19 relief programs that Congress established in the early days of the pandemic. More than 600 other people and entities face federal fraud charges. 











            But that's just the start, according to investigators who testified as the House Oversight and Accountability Committee held its first hearing in the new Congress on fraud and waste in federal pandemic spending. Congress approved about $4.6 trillion in spending from six coronavirus relief laws, beginning in March 2020, when Trump was in the White House and including the $1.9 trillion package that Democrats passed in the first months of the Biden presidency.

            “We owe it to the American people to get to the bottom of the greatest theft of American taxpayer dollars in history,"" said Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., the committee chairman.

            
                Gene L. Dodaro, head of the Government Accountability Office, told lawmakers that it will be some time before the full extent of fraud is known. The inspector general for the Small Business Administration has more than 500 ongoing investigations involving loan programs designed to help businesses meet operating expenses during the pandemic. The Labor Department's internal watchdog continues to open at least 100 unemployment insurance fraud investigations each week.

            The GAO said the more than 1,000 convictions related to COVID-19 relief fraud are one measure of how extensive it was. ""There are definitely indications of widespread fraud, but it's impossible to estimate right now what the full extent will be,"" Dodaro said.

            Michael Horowitz, the Justice Department inspector general who chairs the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee, told lawmakers that the amount of fraud and misspent funds is “clearly in the tens of billions of dollars.""

            “It wouldn’t surprise me if it exceeds ultimately more than $100 billion, but we have so much work to do,"" Horowitz said. “So we’re going to be counting and figuring this out for years to come. We're going to go after every penny we can.""

            Some 20 inspectors general work collaboratively to investigate pandemic relief spending. Horowitz said data analysis is critical to their work.

            For example, this week the committee issued a fraud alert regarding the use of questionable Social Security numbers to obtain $5.4 billion in pandemic-related loans and grants. He said a team of data scientist compared tens of millions of applications with data at the Social Security Administration to see if they fully matched the SSA's records. 

            “Over 69,000 didn't,"" Horowitz said. “This type of advanced data analytics is transforming how we do oversight.""

            To prevent fraud during future emergencies, Horowitz recommended that Congress permanently fund the committee's data analytics center. He said the recent fraud alert identifying potentially $5.4 billion in fraud is 360 times the annual cost of operating such a platform, so the return on investment for taxpayers is clear.

            One of the biggest factors in the COVID fraud that occurred was the need to get dollars out to people and businesses as quickly as possible. Horowitz said it is critical that agencies assess applicant eligibility before payments are sent out, but the SBA allowed entities applying for Paycheck Protection Program to self-certify they were eligible. He said that resulted in $3.6 billion going out to some 57,000 applicants on the federal government's do-not pay list, “a list the SBA did not bother to cross-check.""

            The House committee, which plans to examine an array of hot-button issues, includes some of the most strident critics of the Biden administration as well as some of its most ardent supporters. The clash in perspectives was evident from the start as Comer complained that the Biden administration faced little to no scrutiny last Congress. 

            “This committee has for too long stood on the sidelines while taxpayer dollars were wasted by bureaucrats whose only priority is getting money out the door,"" Comer said. 

            Rep. Jamie Raskin, the ranking Democrat on the committee, said the COVID relief programs “were by no means perfect."" But he said the result of the programs was the shortest economic recession on record.

            Raskin said the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis held at least seven hearings focused on combating fraud in relief programs and he blamed the Trump administration for allowing much of the fraud to occur. He said organized criminals and fraudsters took advantage of the overwhelming crush in demand for assistance and the problem was compounded by decisions “that hamstrung"" the government's oversight.

            “The Trump administration regularly told agencies to ignore data reporting requirements,"" Raskin said.

            White House spokesman Ian Sams issued a statement after the hearing saying that Biden has empowered inspectors general to monitor COVID relief programs, secured money to strengthen anti-fraud measures and appointed a chief pandemic prosecutor.

            “Many Republicans on the Oversight Committee defended the prior administration’s handling of these programs and opposed efforts to fund fraud prevention, yet are now using this issue to try to score political points,"" Sams said.

            The election win at the Asian Football Confederation’s annual meeting followed Cristiano Ronaldo arrival last month to play in the Saudi league and longstanding speculation about a likely bid to host the World Cup in 2030 or 2034.

            Saudi soccer federation president Yasser Almisehal was among six Asian soccer officials elected by AFC members to represent them on FIFA’s decision-making committee through 2027. Saudi Arabia was the only candidate to host the Asian championship.











            Qatari soccer federation president Sheikh Hamad Al Thani, whose country hosts the next Asian Cup in January 2024, also was elected to the FIFA Council. Sheikh Hamad earned 40 votes from the 45 federations, while Almisehal got 35.

            The 37-member FIFA Council is chaired by Gianni Infantino, the governing body's president who attended the election meeting in Bahrain.

            The election results confirmed Saudi Arabia and Qatar at the heart of Asian soccer politics with the AFC presidency scheduled to be vacant in 2027.

            AFC president Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa of Bahrain was reelected by acclamation Wednesday to a final four-year term in a job he has held since 2013. He is also formally No. 2 to Infantino as the most senior of FIFA’s eight vice presidents.

            FIFA Council positions — which pay a $250,000 salary in Zurich — were also won by Kohzo Tashima of Japan and Mariano Araneta of the Philippines, who retained their seats, and newcomer Hamidin Bin Mohd Amin, the Malaysian soccer federation leader.

            Losing candidates were Du Zhaocai of China and Chung Mong-Gyu of South Korea, a scion of the family that owns Hyundai and who lost his seat in 2019.

            The election for a FIFA Council seat protected for a woman was won by Kanya Keomany of Laos.

            Later in the meeting, the Saudi bid to host the 2027 Asian Cup was confirmed unopposed. India withdrew its bid in December.

            Presenting the bid on stage, Saudi sports minister Abdulaziz bin Turki Al-Faisal called the 2027 tournament “a transformational moment in our collective football story.”

            Saudi Arabia is a three-time champion of the Asian Cup, in 1984, 1988 and 1996, but has never hosted the tournament.

            The kingdom raised its soccer profile when Ronaldo signed a 2 1/2-year deal with Al Nassr, and has been speculatively linked with a three-continent co-hosting bid to host the 2030 World Cup with Egypt from Africa and Greece from Europe.

            That would require sending the tournament back to Asia and the Arabian Gulf only eight years after Qatar hosted the 2022 edition. A 2034 bid could be more realistic.

            FIFA is expected to let more than 200 member federations choose the 2030 host next year.

            
                Spain and Portugal, currently with Ukraine also, are planning a European bid for the 2030 World Cup, while a four-nation South American bid that brings together Argentina, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay, the inaugural host 100 years earlier in 1930, is also expected.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797187,European inflation eases for 3rd month but prices still bite,"LONDON (AP) — Europe's inflation rate dipped at the start of the year, giving some relief to consumers but still leaving them facing higher prices that have driven protests and will likely press the European Central Bank into another interest rate hike Thursday.

            The consumer price index for the 20 countries that use the euro currency reached 8.5% in January compared with a year earlier, European Union statistics agency Eurostat said Wednesday. That's down from the annual rate of 9.2% in December.

            It's the first report on consumer prices that includes data from Croatia, which joined the eurozone on Jan. 1, but lacked unavailable figures from Germany, Europe's biggest economy. Inflation in Europe has now slowed for the third month in a row, falling from a record high of 10.6% in October. 











            Food and energy prices are persisting as the major factors driving up European inflation. Prices for food, alcohol and tobacco rose at a 14.1% annual pace in January, while energy prices rose 17.2%.

            Russia's war in Ukraine has shaken up food and energy markets, and while commodity prices have fallen from all-time highs last year, consumers are not yet seeing relief on their utility and grocery bills. 

            
                Natural gas prices have dropped from records last summer thanks to a scramble to find supplies outside Russia and warmer winter weather that eased energy demand for heating. While Europe may have dodged fears of energy rationing and shortages after Russia cut off most supplies, natural gas prices are still three times higher than before Russia started massing troops on Ukraine’s border.

            The energy upheaval has made the cost-of-living squeeze more painful in continental Europe and the United Kingdom than in the U.S., leading to protests and strikes from workers in several countries seeking pay that keeps pace with inflation. 

            U.S. annual inflation dropped to 6.5% in December, while the U.K. reading of 10.5% signaled how the British economy was a striking exception to the International Monetary Fund's brighter outlook for 2023.

            In the eurozone, so-called core inflation, which doesn't include volatile food and energy costs, held steady at 5.2% last month, underlining how prices also are rising for both services and goods such as clothing, appliances, cars and computers.

            Germany’s inflation number wasn’t available because of a technical issue so an estimate was used. Economists said that means the inflation figure should be taken with a pinch of salt.

            Still, “when it comes to monetary policy, this is just noise,” Jack Allen-Reynolds of Capital Economics said in a report. “The core inflation rate is sending a clear signal: underlying price pressures remain strong.”

            With inflation far above its target of 2%, the ECB has been raising interest rates that make it more expensive for consumers to borrow money. Aiming to get price spikes under control, the central bank is expected to institute another half-point hike Thursday. 

            That will come a day after a decision by the U.S. Federal Reserve and the same day the Bank of England acts on borrowing costs.

            The central bank moves to cool inflation also strain the economy, with Europe eking out just 0.1% growth in the final three months of last year and 3.5% for all of 2022. That outpaced the 2.1% expansion in the U.S. and China’s 3% growth last year.LONDON (AP) — Europe's inflation rate dipped at the start of the year, giving some relief to consumers but still leaving them facing higher prices that have driven protests and will likely press the European Central Bank into another interest rate hike Thursday.The consumer price index for the 20 countries that use the euro currency reached 8.5% in January compared with a year earlier, European Union statistics agency Eurostat said Wednesday.

The efforts were needed in order to regain the trust of the public, he said.Lai described his own election and the inauguration of former Vice President Chen Chien-jen (陳建仁) as the new premier Tuesday (Jan. 31) as evidence that government and ruling party were paying attention to the concerns of the public, the Liberty Times reported.In addition to national and party reforms, Lai said the two other key tasks were backing Premier Chen’s policies, especially at the Legislative Yuan, but also supporting Tsai Pei-hui (蔡培慧), the DPP candidate in the legislative by-election in Nantou County scheduled for March 4.During the day, the DPP announced it was setting up a new media department to combat disinformation, and converting its women’s affairs department into a gender equality department.",2023/02/01,879,Politics
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797205,Taiwan begins implementing ‘Expanded Overstayers Voluntary Departure Program’,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Visa overstayers who turn themselves in within a limited time will recieve minimum penalties, the National Immigration Agency (NIA) announced in a press release on Wednesday (Feb. 1).The ""Expanded Overstayers Voluntary Departure Program"" is effective from Feb. 1 to June 30. The program adopts measures such as exemption from detention, payment of a minimum fine of NT$2,000 (US$66), and no prohibition on reentering the country to encourage visa overstayers to turn themselves in.Since the COVID-19 pandemic swept over the world in early 2020, international flights have been suspended or reduced, resulting in many foreigners being stranded in Taiwan. As the pandemic around the globe eases and international flights resume, the NIA wrote that it hopes to help foreigners overstaying their visa return home as soon as possible through the Expanded Overstayers Voluntary Departure Program.Draft amendments to some provisions of the Immigration Act have also been sent to the country’s legislature for review. The amendments seek to raise overstay fines from the current NT$2,000- NT$10,000 to NT$30,000- NT$150,000 to deter such behavior more effectively.The amendments will also increase the period of restriction on visa overstayers' reentering the country from a maximum of three years to a maximum of 10 years.The NIA urged those who have overstayed in the country to seize the opportunity to turn themselves in before the increases of the overstay fines and the entry ban period come into effect. It provided a toll-free hotline, 0800-024-881, which offers multilingual services for the public and overstayers to inquire about the program.",2023/02/01,4494,New Immigrants
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797206,HIV treatment still undermined by stigma in some areas,"An HIV diagnosis doesn't carry the death sentence it once brought. Over the past 30 years, enormous improvements have been made in medicine's ability to treat the virus. For most people across the world, these drugs are available for free.Now, people treated for HIV can live normal, productive and healthy lives — those who take medication can have sex without worrying about infecting their partner. That's why doctors who treat the virus told DW the recent news about Johnson and Johnson's failed vaccine trial was disappointing, but not the end of the world.The US pharmaceutical firm stopped phase 3 trials on a highly sought HIV vaccine in January after results that the jab was ineffective at preventing infection.Still, despite these improvements, HIV cases aren't falling as quickly as desired and are still increasing in some parts of the world. A UN report released last summer reported that more than 1.5 million people became infected with HIV in 2021, around three times the global target.Of the 38 million people infected with the virus, around 73% were under treatment, and around 15% still didn't know they had it, the report said. Pandemic-related funding cuts to global HIV and AIDS prevention programs offer one reason for the 2021 stagnation, the report said. But that doesn't tell the whole story.The first step in preventing the spread of HIV is knowing whether you have it.But sometimes people avoid testing out of fear of judgment, experts say. The homophobic, moralistic public health campaigns that emerged in the 1980s in response to the AIDS crisis are still deeply ingrained in people's perceptions of the virus across the globe.""People don't want to get tested and don't want to go to the treatment center if they are going to be stigmatized and then afterwards, discriminated against,” said Josip Begovac, a physician who specializes in treating HIV in Croatia.Begovac said this is why ""integrated"" clinics specializing in testing for all kinds of sexually transmitted diseases that are less stigmatized — like syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia — are generally more successful at reaching those at risk for HIV.Treatment is available for free in Croatia for anyone who seeks it and has insurance. But it is not available to people who do not have insurance, like undocumented migrants, Begovac said. And there is only one HIV treatment center in Croatia, so some have to travel long distances — up to four or five hours — to access care.Like Begovac, Herbary Cheung, a social science professor in Hong Kong who has studied HIV stigma among single mothers in Thailand, said HIV care requires long travel for people living in rural remote areas. In some Thai provinces, it can take up to a day to get to a facility that treats the condition.Once a woman arrives at a center that treats HIV, medication is cheap and available. But treatment is just one part of the struggle. If that woman comes from a tight-knit rural area, news of her positive status can spread fast among family and community members. Some of the women Cheung spoke with, who worked in restaurants or massage parlors, were forced to leave their jobs after their bosses heard about their HIV status.Religion also impacts how HIV is perceived in Thailand — in the Buddhist tradition, the virus is often seen as bad karma, a sign of bad actions in a past life.This stigmatization caused some of Cheung's interview partners to uproot their lives in their small villages to larger metropolitan areas after receiving their HIV diagnosis. There, he said, the women were more anonymous and had better access to care and emoployment.Despite the fact that HIV rates are similar in men and women in Thailand, Cheung said, it is often stereotypically considered a ""woman's disease"". That's because the first reported case of the virus, in 1984, was spread from a Western man who had sex with a Thai female sex worker.Cyrus Mugo is a researcher studying HIV stigma in young people in Kenya, where the virus is endemic. He said in his country, HIV status can impact access to education.Kenya has had access to life-saving HIV drugs since around 2016, he said. But even if people have those drugs, the HIV label often causes families to abstain from sending their HIV-positive kids to the country's popular boarding schools, where school authorities are certain to find out about their positive status.""Parents will say, ‘I do not want my child to go to boarding school because they'll be asked about the HIV status',” said Mugo. ""It's not just about the child. When you talk about a child's HIV status, you're actually talking about the HIV status of the family, because there's a chance that they got it from the mom.”In 2020, children accounted for 35% of new HIV infections in Kenya, according to UNICEF.Mugo said he also thinks stigma plays a big role in Kenya's struggles with uptake of PrEP, a preventative medication for at-risk groups that, if taken correctly, can reduce a person's chances of getting the virus through sex by up to 99%.""Uptake is not as good as we'd want it to be,” he said. ""We were hoping we could reach as many high-risk people as we could, but we've not been able to reach those high levels… People are wary about taking pills for prevention. You know, taking medicine to prevent yourself from getting sick is not the same as taking medicine because you're sick.”He said this wariness, plus concern about what others might think, deters people from using the medication.""You're taking PrEP and so someone might misconstrue it to mean that you're HIV infected,” he said. ""Or you're taking PrEP and so you must have loose morals — that's the other thing that's associated with PrEP and even use of condoms… They think that your sexual activity is all over the place and that's why you need it.”Mugo said there are lots of factors that play a role in people's disinterest in PrEP, but that it ultimately comes down to fear of judgment from others.""Stigma, I think, is the heartbeat of it,” he said.The treatment has been very successful at lowering HIV mortality rates — HIV patients on treatment currently have the same mortality rates as those who don't have HIV. However researchers say a daily pill is inconvenient, and a longer acting treatment would be easier for people to take. These are in the pipeline and available in some Western countries, but not everywhere.Another preventative treatment is the aforementioned PrEP, a daily oral medication that is highly effective if taken correctly. But only some of the world's countries have access to the drugs, and those that do might have trouble with uptake for some of the reasons Mugo explained in Kenya.Edited by: Carla Bleiker",2023/02/01,,

Amassing RF’s (Russia's) reserves in the occupied territories requirespecifics from (Ukraine) & partners,"" adviser Mykhailo Podolyak posted on Twitter.""So: 1. There is already a tank coalition (logistics, training, supply). 2. There are already talks on longer-range missiles & attack aircraft supply,"" Podolyak said.The Kremlin meanwhile said that Western deliveries of long-range weapons to Ukraine would not change Russia's military objectives in Ukraine.""This is a direct course to whipping up tension and to escalating the level (of fighting).

The decline marks the third straight month of the downward trend since inflation peaked at 10.7% in October.In December, the number had been 9.2%.However, analysts warned that the numbers may offer little relief to consumers as prices for goods remained high.Although the shake-up to the prices of food and fuel driven by Russia's invasion of Ukraine has leveled off on a larger scale, that has had little effect thus far on energy and grocery bills.Prices for food have risen some 14.1%, while energy prices rose 17.2% year-over-year.Europe has managed, however, to avert an even worse energy crisis that threatened to engulf the continent last spring due to reliance on Russian gas. This is due partly to a successful campaign to secure new energy partners as well as a mild winter that reduced the need for heating.Despite this, core inflation, which doesn't include the volatile food and energy markets, held steady at 5.2% for January as prices increased for items such as clothing, appliances, cars and computers.The European Central Bank is expected to announce another rate hike on Thursday in an effort to bring inflation closer to its 2% target, though this will continue to make it more expensive for consumers to borrow money.es/sms (AP, Reuters)",2023/02/01,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797209,Will 2023 be the decisive year in Myanmar's civil war?,"Thousands dead and at least 1.5 million internally displaced persons, that is the cost of the civil war in Myanmar so far.Since Myanmar's military, known as the Tatmadaw, took power on February 1, 2021, there have been repeated battles, attacks and kidnappings throughout the country. The prisons are full of political prisoners who are abused, tortured and murdered by the military.The ousted head of government, Aung San Suu Kyi, was sentenced in sham trials to a total of more than 30 years in prison. Independent reporting is extremely difficult, and journalists are threatened, persecuted and killed.There are at least three conflicting parties in this civil war. The military government calls itself the State Administrative Council (SAC). The resistance consists of the National Unity Government (NUG), the parliament in-exile (Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw, CRPH, elected in 2020 but ousted by coup), and the People's Defense Forces PDF.Then there are a variety of ethnic groups spread throughout Myanmar and their armies, some of which support the resistance, others the military government, and in some cases those who remain neutral.Like any civil war, the conflict has military, economic and political dimensions. In all areas, the parties to the conflict are trying to gain the upper hand.Militarily, the picture is divided. The Tatmadaw dominates large parts of Myanmar's heartland and large cities such as Yangon, Mandalay and the capital, Naypyidaw.Regions populated by ethnic minorities form a horseshoe around the heartland. Here, either the NUG or the respective ethnic minorities have the upper hand.However, analysts agree that there will be no march on the capital any time soon, as the balance of raw military power continues to favor the Tatmadaw. This is thanks in part to Russian arms deliveries last November. Myanmar's military now has Sukhoi Su-30 fighter jets at its disposal, while many citizen militias have to get by with homemade rifles.Political scientist Michal Lubina, from the Jagiellonian University in Krakow, told DW that the armed resistance aims to pressure the military on as many fronts as possible.Lubina said this could potentially spark a counter coup, or at least a power reshuffle within the Tatmadaw. ""That would open a door for negotiation with the PDFs, or NUG,"" he added.  However, there are currently no signs that this will happen anytime soon.Through civil disobedience, attacks on infrastructure such as the power grid, and boycotts of military-owned businesses, the resistance aims to cut off the Tatmadaw from essential revenue streams.Conversely, the military is trying to prevent the transfer of donations from the population to the resistance, while building a favorable environment for its own economic supporters.As a result of this internal economic war, Myanmar's gross domestic product has shrunk dramatically. In July 2022, it was still 13% smaller than in the year before the coup, according to the World Bank. Around 40% of the population lives below the national poverty line.Although population suffers in these miserable economic conditions, this side of the conflict continues undecided.While it remains unclear militarily and economically what 2023 will bring, it can already be said that the military is doing everything it can to achieve a political victory and strengthen its legitimacy by announcing elections in the coming year.It is already clear that the elections will be neither free nor fair. And they cannot be held everywhere country. The election commission consists of 15 members handpicked by the military chief.In fiercely contested areas, it will be virtually impossible to allow the population to vote. The electoral system will also be altered in such a way that strongly favors the military, for which 25% of all seats in all parliaments are already reserved, according to the constitution.Last Friday, electoral law reform was enacted that makes it impossible for many parties to participate in the elections. For example, parties must have 100,000 proven members three months after their registration in order to participate in the elections.Although the majority of Myanmar's population rejects the elections and military rule, the Tatmadaw can still use its position of power to build ties abroad.""The junta is tired of being called the junta. They want to preserve a sort of facade to make it easier, especially for Asian powers, to normalize relations with Myanmar,"" said Lubina. These countries would include China, India, Thailand, Vietnam and Singapore.The mock election could make it more palatable for these countries, which have fewer reservations over military rule than Europe or the US, to work with Myanmar. And Myanmar's military needs these partners to get the country's economy moving again.The elections also pose a risk to the image of the resistance abroad.The International Crisis Group's Myanmar expert Richard Horsey told DW that if voting stations are attacked by citizen militias, and the elections overshadowed by excessive violence, that would make it easier for countries that do not want to take sides to relativize the conflict.""The problem with electoral violence is it's unlikely to prevent the regime from going ahead with whatever plans it has,"" he said.""It will damage the reputation of the resistance and it will make it easier for countries who in any case want to portray this for their own reasons as a 'complex issue,' and say 'no one's in the right there. It's a conflict. You have to look at all sides of this,'"" he said.Horsey said Tatmadaw leader Min Aung Hlaing sees the election as a transition process ""not back to democracy, not back to peace, not away from violence, but towards consolidating his control and his vision for the future of Myanmar.""This would be a future with Hlaing at the head of a military government in civilian garb legitimized by sham elections.This article has been translated from German",2023/02/01,,

As the server was not password protected, the data was left open for anyone who knew its IP address to access.Furthermore, the database had been exposed since as early as May 2022. When TechCrunch contacted Hotai Motor during the Lunar New Year holiday regarding the issue, the company failed to respond.It was not until TechCrunch contacted the Ministry of Digital Affairs on Saturday (Jan. 28) that Minister Audrey Tang (唐鳳) emailed to say the Taiwan Computer Emergency Response Team / Coordination Center had been notified of the incident. According to TechCrunch, the database became inaccessible within an hour of Tang’s reply.iRent wrote in a statement later that it had blocked unauthorized access to the IP “immediately” and conducted a thorough system inspection to verify the scope of the leak. It added it would notify its customers of the data leak.The Directorate General of Highways (DGH) at the Ministry of Transportation and Communications on Wednesday (Feb. 1) wrote in a press release that it will investigate whether the company had legally required security maintenance plans and whether it reported the incident according to regulations. Additionally, it sent an inspector to iRent to audit the company’s administration for any Personal Data Protection Act violations, which could result in fines between NT$20,000 (US$670) and NT$200,000.",2023/02/01,1593,Business

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797218,Apple and Google app stores get thumbs down from White House,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration is taking aim at Apple and Google for operating mobile app stores that it says stifle competition.

            The finding is contained in a Commerce Department report released by the administration on Wednesday as President Joe Biden convened his competition council for an update on efforts to promote competition and lower prices.

            “You've heard me say capitalism without competition isn't capitalism,” Biden said Wednesday before convening the meeting, “it is just simply exploitation,"" he said.











            And on another competition front, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was pushing forward with efforts to limit credit card late fees.

            The report from the Commerce Department's National Telecommunications and Information Administration says the current app store model — dominated by Apple and Google — is “harmful to consumers and developers"" by inflating prices and reducing innovation. The firms have a stranglehold on the market that squelches competition, it adds.

            “The policies that Apple and Google have in place in their own mobile app stores have created unnecessary barriers and costs for app developers, ranging from fees for access to functional restrictions that favor some apps over others” the report said. 

            In an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal in January, Biden called on Democrats and Republicans to rein in large tech firms without mentioning Cupertino, California-based Apple Inc. and Mountain View, California-based Google LLC by name. 

            “When tech platforms get big enough, many find ways to promote their own products while excluding or disadvantaging competitors — or charge competitors a fortune to sell on their platform,” Biden said. “My vision for our economy is one in which everyone — small and midsized businesses, mom-and-pop shops, entrepreneurs — can compete on a level playing field with the biggest companies.”

            A representative from Apple told The Associated Press that “we respectfully disagree with a number of conclusions reached in the report, which ignore the investments we make in innovation, privacy and security — all of which contribute to why users love iPhone and create a level playing field for small developers to compete on a safe and trusted platform.""

            And a Google spokesperson said the firm also disagrees with the report, namely “how this report characterizes Android, which enables more choice and competition than any other mobile operating system.”

            A legal battle over app store dominance is already playing out in the courts.

            Apple has defended the area surrounding its iPhone app store, known as a walled garden, as an indispensable feature prized by consumers who want the best protection available for their personal information. It has said it faces significant competition from various alternatives to video games on its iPhones. And Google has long defended itself against claims of monopoly.

            The Commerce Department report said “new legislation and additional antitrust enforcement actions are likely necessary” to boost competition in the app ecosystem.

            Alan Davidson, the NTIA administrator, told reporters the report ""identifies where legislation would be needed to address some of these issues.”

            Biden said that his administration will work with state and local officials to identify ways to crack down on junk fees in their jurisdictions. He also called on Congress to pass the Junk Fee Protection Act that would target hidden fees in the entertainment, travel and hospitality industries. 

            Meanwhile, the White House said the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau would move forward with a proposed rule to limit credit card late fees, which the bureau estimates would save consumers roughly $9 billion in late fees annually.

            Rohit Chopra, the bureau's director, said the rule is projected to reduce typical late fees from roughly $30 to $8 for missed payments and could go into effect as soon as 2024.

            “Historically, credit card companies charge relatively small penalty amounts for missed payments, but once they discovered that these fees could be a source of easy profits, late fees shot up with a surge occurring in the 2000s,"" Chopra told reporters. “And in recent years, these late fees have surged to as much as $41 for a missed payment. These fees add up, with consumers being hit with $12 billion a year in late fees in addition to the billions of dollars in interest they’re paying.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797234,"Who is Hindenburg, the firm targeting India's Adani?","NEW YORK (AP) — Hindenburg Research, the financial research firm with an explosive name and a track record of sending the stock prices of its targets tumbling, is taking on one of the world’s richest men. 

            Hindenburg is back in the headlines after last week accusing Indian conglomerate Adani Group of “a brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud scheme.” It cited two years of research, including talks with former Adani senior executives and reviews of thousands of documents.

            The Adani Group has blasted the accusations, calling them “a malicious combination of selective misinformation and stale, baseless and discredited allegations that have been tested and rejected by India’s highest courts.”











            Nevertheless, Hindenburg’s scorching allegations have caused the fortune of Adani Group’s founder, Gautam Adani, to slide by nearly $47 billion in just over a week, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires index. Here’s a look at the firm behind all the movement: 

            WHAT IS IT? 

            Hindenburg says it specializes in “forensic financial research.” In layman’s terms, it looks for corruption or fraud in the business world, such as accounting irregularities and bad actors in management. 

            Hindenburg has even come to be known as Ponzi hunters in some circles, according to the Washington Post, which detailed how it helped bring down an alleged $500 million scheme that targeted Mormons.

            WHERE DID ITS NAME COME FROM?

            The firm says it sees the Hindenburg, the airship that famously caught fire in the 1930s to the cry of “Oh, the humanity,” as the “epitome of a totally man-made, totally avoidable disaster.” It says it looks for similar disasters in financial markets “before they lure in more unsuspecting victims.” 

            WHO ELSE HAS HINDENBURG GONE AFTER?

            It's perhaps most famous for a 2020 report on Nikola, a company in the electric-vehicle industry whose founder Hindenburg said made misleading claims to ink partnerships with top auto companies hungry to catch up to Tesla. 

            Among its allegations, Hindenburg accused Nikola of staging a video to calm skepticism about its truck, one that showed the vehicle cruising on a road. Hindenburg said the video was actually just showing the truck rolling down a hill after getting towed to the top. 

            WHAT HAS COME OF SUCH ACCUSATIONS? 

            For Nikola, quick scrutiny from the government and investors. 

            The company and its founder, Trevor Milton, received grand jury subpoenas from the U.S Attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York and the N.Y. County District Attorney’s Office shortly after Hindenburg released its report. 

            The Securities and Exchange Commission also soon issued subpoenas to Nikola’s directors.

            Milton was convicted this past October of charges he deceived investors with exaggerated claims about his company’s progress in producing zero-emission 18-wheel trucks fueled by electricity or hydrogen. 

            And Nikola in late 2021 agreed to pay $125 million to settle SEC charges that it defrauded investors by misleading them about its products, technical advancements, and commercial prospects.

            WHAT DOES HINDENBURG GET OUT OF THIS? 

            It can make money. In its Adani report, it said that it had taken a “short position in Adani Group Companies” through bonds that trade in the U.S. and other investments that trade outside India. 

            It has made similar “short” bets against other companies it published unflattering reports on. A “short” trade is a way for someone to make money if an investment's price falls. Afterward, if the price of a company's stock or bonds falls because of the negative attention from the report, Hindenburg can profit. 

            Such short sellers have been criticized for unfairly pushing down prices of stocks with potentially unfounded allegations. But proponents also call them a healthy part of a stock market, keeping stock prices in check and preventing them from running too high.NEW YORK (AP) — Hindenburg Research, the financial research firm with an explosive name and a track record of sending the stock prices of its targets tumbling, is taking on one of the world’s richest men.Hindenburg is back in the headlines after last week accusing Indian conglomerate Adani Group of “a brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud scheme.” It cited two years of research, including talks with former Adani senior executives and reviews of thousands of documents.The Adani Group has blasted the accusations, calling them “a malicious combination of selective misinformation and stale, baseless and discredited allegations that have been tested and rejected by India’s highest courts.”Nevertheless, Hindenburg’s scorching allegations have caused the fortune of Adani Group’s founder, Gautam Adani, to slide by nearly $47 billion in just over a week, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires index.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797235,Russia said eyeing eastern Ukraine push; Kyiv targets graft,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia is mustering its military might in the Luhansk region of Ukraine, officials said Wednesday, in what Kyiv suspects is preparation for an offensive as the first anniversary of Moscow’s invasion approaches.

            Also Wednesday, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s government continued its crackdown on alleged corruption with the dismissal of several high-ranking officials, prominent lawmaker David Arakhamia said.

            Zelenskyy was elected in 2019 on an anti-establishment and anti-corruption platform in a country long gripped by graft. The latest allegations come as Western allies are channeling billions of dollars to help Kyiv fight Moscow and as the Ukrainian government is introducing reforms so it can potentially join the European Union one day.











            Ukraine's Security Service said on the Telegram messaging app that an operation on Wednesday targeted “corrupt officials who undermine the country’s economy and the stable functioning of the defense-industrial complex.” It identified one as a former Defense Ministry official accused of embezzling state funds through the purchase of nearly 3,000 bulletproof vests that would inadequately protect Ukrainian soldiers.

            Summing up the day's focus on fighting corruption, Zelenskyy declared in his nightly video address Wednesday: “We will not allow anyone to weaken our state.”

            On the battlefront, a Russian missile destroyed an apartment building and damaged seven others in the eastern Donetsk provincial city of Kramatorsk late Wednesday, killing at least three people and wounding at least 20, police said. Rescuers were searching the rubble for other victims. Russia has frequently attacked apartment buildings during the war, causing civilian casualties, although the Kremlin often denies such reports. 

            Zelenskyy used the attack to press again for more Western weapons: “No goal other than terror,” he said on Facebook. “The only way to stop Russian terrorism is to defeat it. By tanks. Fighter jets. Long-range missiles.”

            Elsewhere, the Kremlin’s forces were expelling residents near the Russian-held parts of the front line so they can't tell Ukrainian artillery forces about Russian troop deployments, Luhansk Gov. Serhiy Haidai said.

            “There is an active transfer of (Russian troops) to the region and they are definitely preparing for something on the eastern front in February,” Haidai said.

            The Institute for the Study of War predicted “an imminent Russian offensive in the coming months.” Some predict it will coincide with the invasion anniversary on Feb. 24. 

            The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reported Wednesday that Russia was also concentrating in neighboring Donetsk province, especially in its bid to capture the key city of Bakhmut.

            Donetsk and Luhansk provinces make up the Donbas, an industrial region bordering Russia that President Vladimir Putin identified as a goal for takeover from the war’s outset and where Moscow-backed separatists have fought Ukrainian forces since 2014.

            Russian shelling of Bakhmut, from which most residents have fled while others shelter in cellars, killed at least five civilians and wounded 10 on Tuesday, Ukraine’s presidential office said.

            Donetsk Gov. Pavlo Kyrylenko posted images of the shelling aftermath, showing huge black holes in residential buildings in the embattled city, reporting that Russia is deploying more troops.

            Donetsk was one of four provinces that Russia illegally annexed in the fall, but controls only about half of it. To take the remaining half, Russian forces have no choice but to go through Bakhmut, the only approach to bigger Ukrainian-held cities. Russian forces have been trying for months to capture Bakhmut. 

            Moscow-installed authorities in Donetsk claimed Russian troops are “closing the ring” around the city. But the Wagner Group, a Kremlin-controlled paramilitary group headed by businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin, on Wednesday denied that Bakhmut was encircled. “When the city is taken, you will certainly know about it,” Prigozhin said in an online post.

            Ukraine is keen to secure more Western military aid to fend off much larger Russian forces. It has already won pledges of tanks and now wants more. 

            Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov described media reports about planned new U.S. military assistance to Ukraine as “a direct path to inciting tensions and taking the escalation to a new level.”

            “It will require additional efforts on our part, but it won’t change the course of events,” he told reporters.

            In other developments Wednesday:

            —David Arakhamia, the head of a parliamentary faction, said several senior officials were targeted in the government’s anti-corruption drive. Among those dismissed were Yuri Sotnik, First Deputy Chairman of the State Forest Agency; Alexander Shchutsky, First Deputy Chairman of the State Customs Service; and Andrei Lordkipanidze, Deputy Chairman of the State Service for Food Safety and Consumer Protection, Arakhamia said. In addition, the deputy head of the customs service, Ruslan Cherkassky, has been suspended, according to Arakhamia. 

            The Security Service of Ukraine said two customs officials in northern Ukraine were placed under house arrest on accusations that they helped illegally import ambulances without paying customs fees. A third target was the former management of oil producing company Ukrnafta and refiner Ukrtatnafta. They were accused of tax evasion and “legalization of funds obtained through criminal means,” the Security Service said.

            Ukrainian media reported that high-profile anti-corruption raids targeted oligarch Ihor Kolomoisky and former interior minister Arsen Avakov.

            —Ukraine's anti-corruption drive is expected to be on the agenda when the European Union’s two top officials, Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Council President Charles Michel, meet with Zelenskyy on Friday. Ukraine’s long road toward potential membership of the EU will be a key issue under discussion, with stamping out corruption a key condition.

            —Authorities in Russia’s western Bryansk province, which borders Ukraine, reported power outages after a Ukrainian rocket allegedly fell near an oil pumping station. No one was reported hurt. Putin met with officials to discuss alleviating damage from such cross-border attacks. Gov. Alexander Bogomaz told Putin that in the Bryansk region, Ukrainian shelling has killed four people, wounded 22 and damaged 235 houses since the conflict started. Kursk Gov. Roman Starovoit said 23 apartment buildings and 379 private houses in his region have been damaged. Putin said “the priority task is to liquidate the possibility of shelling,” repair damaged buildings and infrastructure, and compensate residents. Ukrainian officials have kept mum about most cross-border attacks, but emphasized their right to strike Russian territory.

            —At a news conference in Kyiv with Austrian President Alexander Van der Bellen, Zelenskyy condemned Austrian businesses, which “do not leave Russia and continue to support the terrorist state.” He mentioned Raiffeisen Bank, which he said not only pays taxes but announced a tax holiday for mobilized Russian troops. “This is unacceptable in today’s realities,” Ukraine’s president said. The bank didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Austrian media quoted Raiffeisen Bank as saying it's required under Russian law to provide the tax holiday.

            Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine: https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraineKYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia is mustering its military might in the Luhansk region of Ukraine, officials said Wednesday, in what Kyiv suspects is preparation for an offensive as the first anniversary of Moscow’s invasion approaches.Also Wednesday, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s government continued its crackdown on alleged corruption with the dismissal of several high-ranking officials, prominent lawmaker David Arakhamia said.Zelenskyy was elected in 2019 on an anti-establishment and anti-corruption platform in a country long gripped by graft. The latest allegations come as Western allies are channeling billions of dollars to help Kyiv fight Moscow and as the Ukrainian government is introducing reforms so it can potentially join the European Union one day.Ukraine's Security Service said on the Telegram messaging app that an operation on Wednesday targeted “corrupt officials who undermine the country’s economy and the stable functioning of the defense-industrial complex.” It identified one as a former Defense Ministry official accused of embezzling state funds through the purchase of nearly 3,000 bulletproof vests that would inadequately protect Ukrainian soldiers.Summing up the day's focus on fighting corruption, Zelenskyy declared in his nightly video address Wednesday: “We will not allow anyone to weaken our state.”On the battlefront, a Russian missile destroyed an apartment building and damaged seven others in the eastern Donetsk provincial city of Kramatorsk late Wednesday, killing at least three people and wounding at least 20, police said. Rescuers were searching the rubble for other victims. Russia has frequently attacked apartment buildings during the war, causing civilian casualties, although the Kremlin often denies such reports.Zelenskyy used the attack to press again for more Western weapons: “No goal other than terror,” he said on Facebook. “The only way to stop Russian terrorism is to defeat it. By tanks. Fighter jets. Long-range missiles.”Elsewhere, the Kremlin’s forces were expelling residents near the Russian-held parts of the front line so they can't tell Ukrainian artillery forces about Russian troop deployments, Luhansk Gov. Serhiy Haidai said.“There is an active transfer of (Russian troops) to the region and they are definitely preparing for something on the eastern front in February,” Haidai said.The Institute for the Study of War predicted “an imminent Russian offensive in the coming months.” Some predict it will coincide with the invasion anniversary on Feb. 24.The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reported Wednesday that Russia was also concentrating in neighboring Donetsk province, especially in its bid to capture the key city of Bakhmut.Donetsk and Luhansk provinces make up the Donbas, an industrial region bordering Russia that President Vladimir Putin identified as a goal for takeover from the war’s outset and where Moscow-backed separatists have fought Ukrainian forces since 2014.Russian shelling of Bakhmut, from which most residents have fled while others shelter in cellars, killed at least five civilians and wounded 10 on Tuesday, Ukraine’s presidential office said.Donetsk Gov. Pavlo Kyrylenko posted images of the shelling aftermath, showing huge black holes in residential buildings in the embattled city, reporting that Russia is deploying more troops.Donetsk was one of four provinces that Russia illegally annexed in the fall, but controls only about half of it. To take the remaining half, Russian forces have no choice but to go through Bakhmut, the only approach to bigger Ukrainian-held cities. Russian forces have been trying for months to capture Bakhmut.Moscow-installed authorities in Donetsk claimed Russian troops are “closing the ring” around the city. But the Wagner Group, a Kremlin-controlled paramilitary group headed by businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin, on Wednesday denied that Bakhmut was encircled. “When the city is taken, you will certainly know about it,” Prigozhin said in an online post.Ukraine is keen to secure more Western military aid to fend off much larger Russian forces. It has already won pledges of tanks and now wants more.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov described media reports about planned new U.S. military assistance to Ukraine as “a direct path to inciting tensions and taking the escalation to a new level.”“It will require additional efforts on our part, but it won’t change the course of events,” he told reporters.In other developments Wednesday:—David Arakhamia, the head of a parliamentary faction, said several senior officials were targeted in the government’s anti-corruption drive.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797236,"Anti-Asian hate 'runs the gamut,' racist Yelp reviews show","WASHINGTON (AP) — As if running a restaurant during a pandemic wasn't tough enough, Christopher Wong also had to contend with a racist troll.

            “I will not have my dog eat in this place because they might cook him,” read the Yelp review of Wong's eatery, the Curry Up Cafe in suburban Los Angeles. “The owner works for the Chinese government.”

            Yelp removed the review after Wong and several regular customers complained, but not before it had already been seen by an unknown number of potential customers.











            “If one person read that and decided not to come in, that's someone who could have been a satisfied customer for years,"" Wong told The Associated Press.

            Last year, Yelp, which is based in San Francisco, removed more than 2,000 racist business reviews before they went online — a nearly tenfold jump over the year before.

            It's a sharp increase that reflects improved efforts by Yelp to combat racist content and shows how even a site known for reviews of restaurants and repair services can become ensnared in America's ongoing battle over online civility.

            While the content included hate speech targeting Black, Latino and LGBTQ people, too, the largest increase was seen in reviews denigrating Asian Americans and Asian American-owned businesses, according to Yelp, which included the figures in its annual trust and safety report, released Wednesday.

            In 2021, Yelp proactively removed only nine posts that included anti-Asian hate. In 2022, it removed 475.

            Yelp first began tracking racial hate speech on its platform in 2020, just as Asian Americans experienced a rise in racially motivated hatred related to COVID-19, which was first identified in China. Then-President Donald Trump added to the controversy, referring to the coronavirus as “kung flu” and “ the Chinese virus.""

            In that context, an increase in racist restaurant reviews isn't surprising, according to University of Michigan marketing professor Justin Huang, author of a recent study that found Asian restaurants saw an 18% drop in customers compared with non-Asian restaurants in the same communities in 2020, equating to more than $7 billion in lost revenue.

            “We've seen an increase in violent incidents, in random attacks,"" Huang said. “Anti-Asian stigmatization during the pandemic really runs the gamut.”

            In total, Yelp said, it removed 26,500 business reviews last year that violated its rules about hate speech, threats or lewdness, an overall increase of 1,300 over the year before.

            Similar to the increase in anti-Asian content, Yelp proactively removed hundreds of reviews containing anti-LGBTQ hate speech last year. Similar content has thrived on social media, both on fringe sites popular with extremists as well as broad platforms like Twitter, which has experienced a rise in racist posts following its purchase by Elon Musk.

            Yelp has fine-tuned its efforts to identify and remove racist content since the pandemic began. In 2020, the platform started allowing businesses to identify that they had a Black, Latino, Asian or LGBTQ owner. As part of the designation, Yelp proactively assesses customer reviews for hate speech before they are posted online.

            Noorie Malik, Yelp's vice president of user operations, said the company is “aggressive” when it comes to taking down “unreliable” reviews, including those that contain hate speech.

            “The trust and safety of the Yelp community is a top priority,"" Malik wrote in a statement emailed to the AP.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797237,Erdogan: Sweden can't join NATO if Quran-burning is allowed,"ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan reaffirmed Wednesday that Turkey won’t allow Sweden to join the NATO military alliance as long as the Scandinavian country permits protests desecrating Islam’s holy book to take place.

            Turkey, which had already been holding off approving Sweden and Finland’s membership in the Western military alliance, has been infuriated by a series of separate demonstrations in Stockholm. In one case a solitary anti-Islam activist burned the Quran outside the Turkish Embassy, while in an unconnected protest an effigy of Erdogan was hanged. Even before that, Ankara had been pressing Sweden and Finland to crack down on exiled members of Kurdish and other groups it sees as terrorists, and to allow arms sales to Turkey.

            Turkey has indefinitely postponed a key meeting in Brussels that would have discussed the two Nordic countries' NATO entry.











            “Sweden, don't even bother! As long as you allow my holy book, the Quran, to be burned and torn, and you do so together with your security forces, we will not say ‘yes’ to your entry into NATO,” Erdogan said in a speech to his ruling party’s legislators.

            Swedish government officials have distanced themselves from the protests, including by a far-right anti-Islam activist who burned copies of the Quran in Stockholm and Copenhagen, Denmark, while also stressing that the demonstrations are protected by freedom of speech.

            On Tuesday, Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson denounced the activists who carried out the demonstrations as “useful idiots” for foreign powers who want to inflict harm on the Scandinavian country as it seeks to join NATO.

            “We have seen how foreign actors, even state actors, have used these manifestations to inflame the situation in a way that is directly harmful to Swedish security,” Kristersson told reporters in Stockholm, without naming any countries.

            Sweden and neighboring Finland abandoned decades of nonalignment and applied to join NATO in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. All NATO members except Turkey and Hungary have ratified their accession, but unanimity is required.

            In a television interview Wednesday, Erdogan suggested that Sweden needs to prevent Quran burning protests.

            “Hate crimes against Muslims under the guise of freedom of expression are unacceptable. We expect that the beliefs of all groups are respected and sincere steps are taken in the fight against Islamophobia,” he told state broadcaster TRT.

            In Finland, which has seen no anti-Turkish or anti-Islam demonstrations, violating religious peace is punishable by law, and desecrating a book held sacred by a religious community would likely violate that law. As a result, police wouldn’t allow a protest that involved burning the Quran.

            There is no similar legislation in other Nordic countries, Finnish public broadcaster YLE said.

            YLE reported Tuesday that a group of anti-NATO demonstrators had planned to burn the Quran in Helsinki last week but changed their minds after police got wind of their plan on social media and intervened.

            Earlier on Wednesday, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Ankara has fewer problems with Finland becoming NATO member than with its neighbor Sweden. He stressed, however, that it was up to the military alliance to decide whether to accept one country only or the Nordic duo together — something that both countries are committed to.

            Should NATO decide to deal with the membership processes of the Nordic neighbors separately, “(Turkey) will then of course reconsider (ratifying) Finland’s membership separately and more favorably, I can say,” Cavusoglu said during a joint news conference with his Estonian colleague in Tallinn. He didn't give a time frame.

            Erdogan also repeated that Turkey’s view on Finland’s membership was “positive.” 

            Meanwhile, Swedish Foreign Minister Tobias Billström told Swedish news agency TT that his country was complying with an agreement reached by Turkey, Sweden and Finland last year, but said that “religion is not part of the agreement.”

            “Having said that, I fully understand that people take offense to the burning of holy writings and perceive it as deeply hurtful,” he said.

            “What is needed now is for the situation to cool down on all sides,” Billström said, adding that talks with Turkey on the implementation of the agreement were continuing. With the joint memorandum signed last year, Sweden and Finland agreed to address Turkey’s security concerns.

            The minister also tied Erdogan’s comments to Turkish domestic politics.

            Erdogan, who faces a tough presidential election in May amid an economic downturn and high inflation, is expected use his strong-arming of Sweden to rally nationalist support.

            “Right now there is an election campaign going on in Turkey and in election campaigns many things are said,” Billström said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797239,Prying eyes: Neighbors win privacy feud with UK Tate gallery,"LONDON (AP) — The U.K. Supreme Court says people who live in glass houses have a right to privacy too.

            The court ruled Wednesday that a viewing platform at London’s Tate Modern art gallery made residents of glass-walled luxury apartments next door feel like animals in a zoo, and impeded “the ordinary use and enjoyment” of their homes.

            The justices overturned earlier lower court rulings that sided with Tate Modern in the long-running privacy battle between the gallery — one of London’s biggest tourist attractions — and residents of four apartments in the neighboring Neo Bankside complex.











            Justice George Leggatt said that the platform was visited by hundreds of thousands of people a year, who “frequently take photographs of the interiors of the flats and sometimes post them on social media."" 

            “It is not difficult to imagine how oppressive living in such circumstances would feel for any ordinary person — much like being on display in a zoo,” he wrote in the court's majority ruling.

            “It is beyond doubt that the viewing and photography which take place from the Tate’s building cause a substantial interference with the ordinary use and enjoyment of the claimants’ properties.""

            The court ruled that the gallery had violated “the common law of private nuisance.” Three judges backed the majority decision and two dissented.

            Tate Modern opened in 2000 in a former power station on the south bank of the River Thames. It helped transform the surrounding Bankside neighborhood from a riverside backwater into an arts and nightlife hub dotted with luxury apartment towers.

            The viewing terrace — which has been closed since the coronavirus pandemic —is part of a pyramid-shaped extension that opened in 2016 at the gallery, which sees more than 5 million visitors a year. Neo Bankside was completed a few years earlier.

            Lawyers for the residents argued the 10th-floor platform, which attracted more than half a million gallery visitors a year, constituted a “relentless” invasion of residents’ privacy. They said gallery visitors subjected the apartments to “intense visual scrutiny,” with some using binoculars and zoom lenses to get a better look.

            The gallery said residents could solve the problem by drawing their blinds or putting up curtains — and judges at the High Court and Court of Appeal agreed.

            But the Supreme Court found that the viewing platform was an “abnormal” use of Tate Modern’s land, and the beleaguered residents had a point.

            “The claimants cannot be obliged to live behind net curtains or with their blinds drawn all day every day to protect themselves from the consequences of intrusion caused by the abnormal use which the Tate makes of its land,” the judges said.

            The ruling surprised many legal experts.

            “Previous court decisions have suggested that if you happen to be overlooked by others, that is just bad luck and you don’t have a legal remedy,” said Richard Cressall, partner at law firm Gordons. “The Supreme Court has decided to put a cap on that.”

            Claire Lamkin, a real estate lawyer at Kingsley Napley, said that although the judges “emphasized the rare circumstances” of the case, “it will no doubt precipitate a wave of copycat cases where people feel a property development near them is highly intrusive.”

            The residents had asked for the gallery to shield their apartments from view, or to pay damages. The Supreme Court sent the case back to the High Court to decide on the appropriate remedy.

            Natasha Rees, a lawyer for the five residents who launched the claim in 2018, said her clients “look forward to working with the Tate as valued neighbors to find a practical solution which protects all of their interests.”

            Tate Modern said in a statement that “as the case is ongoing, we cannot comment further.”LONDON (AP) — The U.K. Supreme Court says people who live in glass houses have a right to privacy too.The court ruled Wednesday that a viewing platform at London’s Tate Modern art gallery made residents of glass-walled luxury apartments next door feel like animals in a zoo, and impeded “the ordinary use and enjoyment” of their homes.The justices overturned earlier lower court rulings that sided with Tate Modern in the long-running privacy battle between the gallery — one of London’s biggest tourist attractions — and residents of four apartments in the neighboring Neo Bankside complex.Justice George Leggatt said that the platform was visited by hundreds of thousands of people a year, who “frequently take photographs of the interiors of the flats and sometimes post them on social media.""“It is not difficult to imagine how oppressive living in such circumstances would feel for any ordinary person — much like being on display in a zoo,” he wrote in the court's majority ruling.“It is beyond doubt that the viewing and photography which take place from the Tate’s building cause a substantial interference with the ordinary use and enjoyment of the claimants’ properties.""The court ruled that the gallery had violated “the common law of private nuisance.” Three judges backed the majority decision and two dissented.Tate Modern opened in 2000 in a former power station on the south bank of the River Thames. It helped transform the surrounding Bankside neighborhood from a riverside backwater into an arts and nightlife hub dotted with luxury apartment towers.The viewing terrace — which has been closed since the coronavirus pandemic —is part of a pyramid-shaped extension that opened in 2016 at the gallery, which sees more than 5 million visitors a year. Neo Bankside was completed a few years earlier.Lawyers for the residents argued the 10th-floor platform, which attracted more than half a million gallery visitors a year, constituted a “relentless” invasion of residents’ privacy. They said gallery visitors subjected the apartments to “intense visual scrutiny,” with some using binoculars and zoom lenses to get a better look.The gallery said residents could solve the problem by drawing their blinds or putting up curtains — and judges at the High Court and Court of Appeal agreed.But the Supreme Court found that the viewing platform was an “abnormal” use of Tate Modern’s land, and the beleaguered residents had a point.“The claimants cannot be obliged to live behind net curtains or with their blinds drawn all day every day to protect themselves from the consequences of intrusion caused by the abnormal use which the Tate makes of its land,” the judges said.The ruling surprised many legal experts.“Previous court decisions have suggested that if you happen to be overlooked by others, that is just bad luck and you don’t have a legal remedy,” said Richard Cressall, partner at law firm Gordons. “The Supreme Court has decided to put a cap on that.”Claire Lamkin, a real estate lawyer at Kingsley Napley, said that although the judges “emphasized the rare circumstances” of the case, “it will no doubt precipitate a wave of copycat cases where people feel a property development near them is highly intrusive.”The residents had asked for the gallery to shield their apartments from view, or to pay damages. The Supreme Court sent the case back to the High Court to decide on the appropriate remedy.Natasha Rees, a lawyer for the five residents who launched the claim in 2018, said her clients “look forward to working with the Tate as valued neighbors to find a practical solution which protects all of their interests.”Tate Modern said in a statement that “as the case is ongoing, we cannot comment further.”",2023/02/02,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797241,Past defeats on police reform bedevil newly divided Congress,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Weeks before President Joe Biden made his first address to Congress in 2021, a graphic video was released of a Black man being killed at the hands of police. 

            The country watched the now hauntingly familiar scene play out across its screens. Family members tearfully pleaded for change. Lawmakers in Washington pledged to pass meaningful reform. 

            Biden pumped momentum into talks during the nationally televised address telling Congress to “get it done” by the next month, the anniversary of a Minneapolis police officer’s killing of another Black man, George Floyd.











            “We’ve all seen the knee of injustice on the neck of Black Americans,” the Democratic president said. “Now is our opportunity to make some real progress.”

            And then, as before, negotiations fell apart along partisan lines, pushing the issue of police brutality to the back of the line of legislative priorities, underscoring again how Congress often fails to deliver solutions even when there is broad agreement on the problem. 

            Nearly two years later, as Biden begins his third year in office, there is another deadly sequel. A video released last week showed the violent Jan. 7 encounter between Tyre Nichols and the Memphis, Tennessee, police officers who savagely beat the 29-year-old Black FedEx worker for three minutes while screaming profanities at him. 

            Nichols was hospitalized and died days later. Five police officers, who also are Black, have been fired and charged with second-degree murder and other offenses in his beating and death. On Monday, two more Memphis police officers were disciplined and three emergency medical technicians were fired in connection with the case.

            Nichols' parents are set to attend Biden's State of the Union address next week, hoping to increase pressure on the president and Washington. 

             And the same lawmakers who were close to a deal the last time are now looking to see if any remnants of a compromise have the chance of passing a newly divided Congress. 

            “I don’t speak on this floor very often,” Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., said on the Senate floor Monday. “But this is my 10th speech on policing in America in eight years.” 

            Scott went on to call out Democrats for asking him to “come back to the table"" following the release of the Nichols video over the weekend despite blocking his legislation from passing two years ago. 

            “I never left the table,” the only Black Republican senator said in an emotional speech. 

            Scott emerged as one of the lead negotiators in the Senate after the brutal police killing of Floyd in 2020. He and Democratic Sen. Cory Booker — two of the three Black men serving in the chamber — embarked on a nine-month, painstaking negotiation. 

            The talks focused on writing compromise legislation curbing law enforcement agencies’ use of force and making them more accountable for abuses. But negotiations stalled over Democrats’ demands to make individual police officers accused of abuses liable for civil penalties. 

            It’s currently difficult to pursue such actions, called “qualified immunity,” in all but the most egregious cases. Republicans and law enforcement groups like the Fraternal Order of Police have resisted easing those limitations.

            Still, the group walked away in agreement on banning chokeholds, curbing the transfer of military equipment to police and increasing funds for mental health programs, which address problems that often lead to encounters with law enforcement officers.

            Those agreements are now the foundation for any negotiations in the wake of Nichols' death. “It’s such a tragedy that they got so damn close,” Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said of the past negotiations. “The good news is there are plenty of pieces that were there that they can pick back up.”

            The conversations between Scott and Booker began over the weekend and are expected to continue through this week. In the House, Rep. Steve Horsford, D-Nev., the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, reached out to set up a meeting with Scott. The group of Black lawmakers is expected to go to the White House on Thursday to meet with Biden. 

            “Despite the dysfunction in Washington, D.C., this is something that all of us can agree that regardless of party, of the region of the country, bad policing shouldn’t exist anywhere in America,” Horsford said. 

            On Monday, several Democrats indicated that they are open to negotiations on even the most hard-fought police reform proposals, even if they fall short of the proposal the party passed in the House after Floyd's death. 

            But whether Republicans will agree remains unclear. Republicans now control the House and are moving forward with legislation that would call out any effort to “defund the police.” And Democrats have a very slim majority in the 100-seat Senate. 

            “I don’t know if there are 60 votes for anything in the Senate,” Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said Monday. “I have been pretty open-minded about trying to do reasonable police reform. It made sense to me then, and it does now, but we’ll see where the space is.” 

            GOP Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, who helped pass a modest police reform bill last year, also was dismissive of the idea an accord could be reached, saying he thinks any agreement ""is probably less likely to happen now with divided government.”

            Vice President Kamala Harris attended Nichols' funeral in Memphis on Wednesday and demanded that Congress pass the George Floyd Justice and Policing Act, legislation she co-authored during her time in the Senate. 

            “Joe Biden will sign it,” Harris said. ""And we should not delay, and we will not be denied. It is non-negotiable.”

            Nichols' loved ones echoed that sentiment. 

            “We need to take some action because there should be no other child that should suffer the way my son — and all the other parents here have lost their children — we need to get that bill passed,"" RowVaughn Wells said Wednesday as they buried her son. ""Because if we don’t, that blood — the next child that dies — that blood is going to be on their hands.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797242,Super Bowl features matchup of 1st and 2nd team All-Pro QBs,"It's only fitting that the top two quarterbacks in the regular season based on All-Pro voting are the last two quarterbacks standing in the NFL this season.

            
                First-team All-Pro quarterback Patrick Mahomes will take his Kansas City Chiefs into the Super Bowl against second-team All-Pro Jalen Hurts and the Philadelphia Eagles.

            This marks the seventh time since the merger that the first-team All-Pro quarterback will face the second-teamer for the championship, with it last happening in the 2016 season when second-teamer Tom Brady's Patriots beat first-teamer Matt Ryan's Falcons 34-28 in overtime.











            That's been the pattern in all six of the matchups, with the second teamer coming out victorious each time: Drew Brees over Peyton Manning in the 2009 season, Mark Rypien over Jim Kelly (1991), Joe Montana over Dan Marino (1984), Montana over Ken Anderson (1981) and Roger Staubach over Bob Griese (1971).

            Both Mahomes and Hurts are among the five finalists for the MVP award that will be announced next week. The winner of the AP NFL MVP hasn't won the Super Bowl since Kurt Warner did it for the Rams in the 1999 season. The last eight MVPs to play in the game all ended up losing.

            
                Mahomes will be starting in his third Super Bowl at the young age of 27 years, 148 days — 39 days younger than Brady in the 2004 season when he became the youngest QB to start in three Super Bowls.

            
                Hurts is set to start his first Super Bowl at age 24, joining Mahomes and six others to do that before turning 25.

            This will be the third Super Bowl with both starting QBs younger than 28, with Brett Favre (27) beating Drew Bledsoe (24) in the game following the 1996 season and Jim McMahon (26) besting Tony Eason (26) following the 1985 season.

            BLOWOUTS

            The Eagles got to the Super Bowl behind a pair of lopsided wins, which bodes well for their chances to win it all based on past history.

            Philadelphia followed up a 38-7 win over the Giants in the divisional round with a 31-7 win over the 49ers in the NFC title game.

            The Eagles became the fifth team to win their divisional round and conference championship games by at least 20 points. The other four teams all followed it up with a Super Bowl victory, with San Francisco doing it in 1988 and '89, Chicago in 1985 and Pittsburgh in 1978.

            The Eagles also became the 11th team to allow seven or fewer points in back-to-back playoff games in the season, with the 2000 Ravens the most recent to do it before Philadelphia. Seven of the previous 10 won the Super Bowl that season.

            The only team to do it three straight games in a single postseason was the Chiefs on the way to their first Super Bowl title in the 1969 season.

            OLD-MAN JOHNSON

            The well-traveled Josh Johnson finally got his first playoff opportunity in some unfortunate circumstances.

            The 36-year-old Johnson has spent time with 14 NFL organizations since being drafted by Tampa Bay in 2008 and played in three different spring leagues.

            Johnson got forced into action for San Francisco after Brock Purdy injured his elbow on the opening drive of the NFC title game.

            Johnson went 7 for 13 for 74 yards and lost a fumble before being knocked out on the first drive of the third quarter with a concussion. He became the third-oldest player at the time of his first postseason pass, with only 40-year-olds Josh McCown and Sonny Jurgensen waiting longer.

            The concussion for Johnson led to Purdy going back into the game despite not being able to throw the ball more than 5 or 10 yards.

            San Francisco threw the ball only 18 times in the 31-7 loss, marking only the fifth time in NFL history a team lost a playoff game by at least 20 points while throwing fewer than 20 passes.

            STREAKS SNAPPED

            The Bengals and 49ers each came into the conference title games on impressive streaks, with San Francisco having won 12 in a row and Cincinnati 10 straight.

            Both got snapped on Sunday.

            Before this year, 10 teams had taken winning streaks of at least 10 games into the conference title game, with eight coming out victorious.

            The only teams to lose before the Bengals and 49ers were the 2004 Steelers (15 straight) and the 1976 Steelers (10 straight).

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797292,EU official pushes Musk for Twitter's progress on new rules,"LONDON (AP) — A top European Union official told Elon Musk that Twitter needs to make progress in preparing for a new law aimed at curbing hate speech, misinformation and other harmful content, adding pressure on the company to ensure it complies. 

            EU Commissioner Thierry Breton and Musk held a video call on Tuesday to assess Twitter's readiness for Europe's new rules, known as the Digital Services Act, that are set to take effect later this year. 

            Breton, who oversees the EU's digital policy, told Musk that he's ""vigilant"" about the resources and tools that Twitter is devoting to tackle trust and safety issues across the 27-nation bloc, including in all its languages, according to a readout of the meeting. 











            Breton noted that Twitter has committed to complying with the new EU regulations, which will start applying to the biggest online platforms by September. 

            “The next few months will be crucial to transform commitments into reality,” Breton said. ""We need to see progress towards full compliance with the DSA. My team will follow closely the work by Twitter and by all other online platforms.”

                Breton had warned Musk in a previous call in November that the company needs to comply with Europe's new rules. 

            The Digital Services Act is part of the EU's overhaul of digital rules aimed at reining in the power of online platforms and social media companies and cleaning up toxic content.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797293,"Lebanon sets new exchange rate, dramatically devalues pound","BEIRUT (AP) — Three years into a crippling financial crisis, Lebanon's Central Bank on Wednesday set a new exchange rate that effectively devalued the country's currency by 90% but did little to bridge the gap with the soaring black market rate.

            The dramatic measure is meant to stabilize the free-falling Lebanese pound and eliminate the multiple exchange rates that currently exist, a key demand of the International Monetary Fund for a bailout package for Lebanon.

            The new rate set Wednesday is 15,000 pounds to the dollar -- a stark contrast the previous, when the Lebanese pound was pegged at just over 1,500 pounds to the dollar. That rate was implemented in 1997, to encourage investor confidence and to stall hyperinflation after its 15-year civil war.











            However, it's unclear how the new rate will be implemented or reconcile a host of different exchange rates that exist for public sector salaries, fuel prices and different services, including telecommunications. 

            Many fear it will lead to another surge in inflation and hike prices of food and other essential goods, as authorities have in the past failed to crack down on illicit price hikes.

            Also, the new official rate is nowhere near the current black market rate of about 60,000 pounds to the dollar, used for buying and selling most goods, nor the Central Bank’s Sayrafa platform — used for certain financial transactions — with 38,000 for $1. It also will apply to withdrawals from dollar accounts, where customers have been withdrawing some of their trapped savings in the local currency, at an exchange rate far lower than market value.

            Lebanon's initial economic boom in the post-civil-war years was eroded by conflict, political paralysis and corruption, while financial maneuvers that kept the exchange rate artificially low for years eventually collapsed. By late 2019, the country started to spiral into an economic meltdown, an unprecedented economic crisis that plunged over three quarters of the population into poverty. 

            
                Lebanon’s Central Bank and Finance Ministry first announced the decision to officially devalue the pound last September. 

            Currency unification is among a list of reforms the IMF has demanded to finalize a bailout package for Lebanon, tentatively approved in April 2022.

            The Finance Ministry already adjusted the customs exchange rate to 15,000 pounds for the dollar in December. Tax collection, balance sheets of the struggling Lebanese banks are now to adjust their exchange rates, and eventually the 2023 state budget. 

            Since 2019, Lebanon’s cash-strapped banks imposed informal limits on cash withdrawals in dollars, with most depositors losing access to their savings after the country's banks made risky investments by buying Lebanese treasury bills, despite widespread corruption from its political leadership. 

            Economist Sami Zoughaib at The Policy Initiative, a Beirut-based think tank, criticized Wednesday's decision by the Central Bank, and called the measure temporary, in the absence of crucial structural economic reforms.

            “We need something that actually reflects the market value, and the only way we can do it is by building a centralized currency market in which people can openly and transparently trade Lebanese pounds and dollars,"" Zoughaib said.

""The Chinese side ... is currently seeking verification with the Czech side, (we) hope the Czech side strictly upholds the one-China principle,"" the Chinese ministry was cited as saying.On Tuesday (Jan. 31), Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ning accused Pavel of “forsaking China’s repeated dissuasion and communication.” She said, “China urges the Czech Republic to immediately take effective action to rectify the mistake in order to lessen the incident’s negative impact.”In response, Topolanek wrote on Twitter, “I condemn the condemnation of Chinese diplomacy.” He added, “I am very concerned. How long will we play the forced game on ‘one China?’ Taiwan is not China and let’s believe it never will be, just like the Republic of Korea is not the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and Ukraine is not Russia.”",2023/02/01,2139,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797310,Myanmar resistance steadfast against army rule 2 years later,"BANGKOK (AP) — The prospects for peace in Myanmar, much less a return to democracy, seem dimmer than ever two years after the army seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, experts say.On Wednesday, legions of opponents of military rule heeded a call by protest organizers to stay home in what they call a “silent strike” to show their strength and solidarity.The opposition’s General Strike Coordination Body, formed soon after the 2021 takeover, urged people to stay inside in their homes or workplaces from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Photos posted on social media showed empty streets in the normally bustling downtown area of Yangon, the country’s largest city, with just a few vehicles on the roads, and there were reports of similar scenes elsewhere.Small peaceful protests are an almost-daily occurrence throughout the country, but on the anniversary of the Feb. 1, 2021, seizure of power by the army, two points stand out: The level of violence, especially in the countryside, has reached the level of civil war; and the grassroots movement opposing military rule has defied expectations by largely holding off the ruling generals.The violence extends beyond the rural battlefields where the army is burning and bombing villages, displacing hundreds of thousands of people in what is a largely neglected humanitarian crisis. It also occurs in the cities, where activists are arrested and tortured and urban guerrillas retaliate with bombings and assassinations of targets linked to the military. The military, after closed trials, have also executed by hanging activists accused of “terrorism.”According to the independent Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, a watchdog group that tracks killings and arrests, 2,940 civilians have been killed by the authorities since the army takeover, and another 17,572 arrested — 13,763 of whom remain detained. The actual death toll is likely to be much higher since the group does not generally include deaths on the side of the military government and cannot easily verify cases in remote areas.“The level of violence involving both armed combatants and civilians is alarming and unexpected,” said Min Zaw Oo, a veteran political activist in exile who founded the Myanmar Institute for Peace and Security.“The scale of the killing and harm inflicted on civilians has been devastating, and unlike anything we have seen in the country in recent memory,"" he said.When the army ousted Suu Kyi in 2021, it arrested her and top members of her governing National League for Democracy party, which had won a landslide victory for a second term in a November 2020 general election. The military claimed it acted because there had been massive electoral fraud, a claim not backed up by objective election observers. Suu Kyi, 77, is serving prison sentences totaling 33 years after being convicted in a series of politically tainted prosecutions brought by the military.Shortly after the military seized power and quashed nonviolent protests with lethal force, thousands of young people slipped away to remote rural areas to become guerrilla fighters.Operating in decentralized “People’s Defense Forces,” or PDFs, they are proving to be effective warriors, specializing in ambushes and occasionally overrunning isolated army and police posts. They have benefited greatly from supplies and training provided by the some of the country’s ethnic minority rebels — Ethnic Armed Organizations, or EAOs — who have been fighting the army for decades for greater autonomy.""That’s not only a very brave thing to do. It’s a very difficult thing to do,” Richard Horsey, an independent analyst and adviser to the International Crisis Group, told The Associated Press. “It’s a very challenging thing to do, to take on, you know, a military that’s been fighting counter-insurgency warfare (for) basically its whole existence.”David Mathieson, another independent analyst with over 20 years' experience in Myanmar, says the opposition’s combat capabilities are “a mixed picture in terms of battlefield performance, organization and unity amongst them.”“But it’s also important to remember two years in that no one was predicting that they were actually going to be as effective as they are now. And in certain areas, the PDFs have been taking on the Myanmar military and, in many respects, besting them on the battlefield in terms of ambush and pitched battles, taking over bases.”He says the military’s heavy weaponry and air power push the situation into a kind of a stalemate where the PDFs are not necessarily taking over large swaths of territory, but fighting back and prevailing.“So no one’s winning at the moment,” Mathieson said.The military government of Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing has an advantage — not just in arms and trained manpower, but also in geography. Myanmar's main neighbors — Thailand, China and India — have geopolitical and economic interests in Myanmar that leave them satisfied with the status quo, which largely secures its borders from becoming a major supply route for weapons and other supplies for the resistance. And while much of the world maintains sanctions against the generals and their government, they can rely on obtaining arms from Russia and China.Min Aung Hlaing’s government is also nominally pursuing a political solution to the crisis it caused, most notably in its promise to hold fresh elections this year. Suu Kyi’s party has rejected taking part, deriding the polls as neither free nor fair, and other activists are employing more direct action, attacking teams from the military government who are conducting surveys to compile voter rolls.“The regime is pushing for an election which the opposition has vowed to derail,” said Min Zaw Oo. “The election won’t change the political status quo; instead, it will intensify violence.”The planned polls “are being run by a regime that overturned the popularly elected government. They are clearly being seen by the Myanmar people for what they are: a cynical effort to overwrite those previous election results that gave a landslide victory to Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy so these are not elections in any meaningful sense of the word,"" Horsey said. ""They have no legitimacy or credibility.”On the diplomatic front, the military government thumbs its nose at international efforts to defuse the crisis, even those from sympathetic fellow members in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, whose harshest response has been to not invite Myanmar’s top military leaders to attend its meetings.Myanmar's army government rejects virtually all efforts at peacemaking as interference in its internal affairs.The resistance, by contrast, actively reaches out for international support. It won small, new diplomatic victories Tuesday as the United States, Australia, Britain and Canada announced new sanctions meant to squeeze the military’s revenue and supply lines. The British and Canadian sanctions are especially noteworthy, as they target the supply of aviation fuel, a move activists have been pleading for to counter the increasing number of airstrikes the pro-democracy forces and their allies in ethnic minority rebel groups have been facing in the field.“Currently, both sides are not ready to seek a political solution,” warned Min Zaw Oo. “The military stalemate won’t shift significantly this year, despite more deaths and violence.”",2023/02/01,121,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797313,Baldwin faces involuntary manslaughter charge in set death,"SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) — Prosecutors linked Alec Baldwin to an expansive list of alleged failures in firearms safety as they filed a felony involuntary manslaughter charge Tuesday against the actor in the fatal shooting of a cinematographer on a New Mexico movie set.Halyna Hutchins died shortly after being wounded during rehearsals at a ranch on the outskirts of Santa Fe on Oct. 21, 2021. Baldwin was pointing a pistol at Hutchins when the gun went off, killing her and wounding the director, Joel Souza.Baldwin and film-set weapons supervisor Hannah Gutierrez-Reed face charges of involuntary manslaughter in the death of Hutchins on the set of the Western movie “Rust.”A manslaughter charge can be brought for a killing that occurs while a defendant is doing something lawful but dangerous and is acting negligently or without caution.Baldwin and Gutierrez-Reed maintain their innocence and have vowed to fight the charges.In newly filed court documents, prosecutors say reckless safety failures accompanied the film production from the outset. They cite Baldwin's failure as an actor to appear for mandatory firearms training prior to filming and his decision as a producer to work with Gutierrez-Reed, who was an uncertified and inexperienced armorer.A probable cause statement from investigators traces safety failures across a 10-day period from misfires on set and a camera crew walkout to the moments before Hutchins' death as a revolver was loaded with ammunition and Baldwin's finger came to rest on the pistol's trigger.“Baldwin's deviation from known standards, practices and protocol directly caused the fatal death of Hutchins,” Robert Shilling, a special investigator for the Santa Fe district attorney’s office, said in the probable cause statement.Baldwin’s attorney Luke Nikas declined to comment Tuesday and referred to a previous statement in which he called the charges a “terrible miscarriage of justice” that he and his client would fight and win.“Mr. Baldwin had no reason to believe there was a live bullet in the gun – or anywhere on the movie set,” the statement said. “He relied on the professionals with whom he worked.”Gutierrez-Reed’s attorney said they would release a statement later.Santa Fe District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies told The Associated Press in a Jan. 19 interview that the set was “really being run pretty fast and loose” and Baldwin should have known there were previous misfires on the set and multiple people had brought up safety concerns. She also highlighted Baldwin as the person ""that held the gun, that pointed the gun and that pulled the trigger.”With charges filed on Tuesday, Baldwin and Gutierrez-Reed will be issued a summons to appear in court, possibly by remote webcast. Prosecutors will forgo a grand jury and rely on a judge to determine if there is sufficient evidence to move toward trial. A decision could take up to 60 days.The manslaughter charges against Baldwin and Gutierrez-Reed include two alternative standards and sanctions.One version would require proof of negligence, which is punishable by up to 18 months in jail and a $5,000 fine under New Mexico law.The second alternative is reckless disregard of safety “without due caution and circumspection.” It carries a higher threshold of wrongdoing and includes a “firearm enhancement” that could result in a mandatory five years in prison because the offense was committed with a gun.A jury may decide which definition of manslaughter to pursue, prosecutors said.Defense litigator Kate Mangels, whose work includes the entertainment sector, said prosecutors submitted a robust analysis of Baldwin's safety responsibilities as actor and producer on “Rust.”“The fact that they separated out Alec Baldwin the actor versus Alec Baldwin the producer shows to me that they're potentially foreseeing a challenge to his culpability as to either of those roles,” said Mangles, who is based in Santa Monica, California. “So they want to differentiate ... and provide a robust analysis of both of those separately.”Investigators said reckless safety failures culminated when Baldwin drew a revolver from a holster, pointed it at Hutchins and fired the weapon when a plastic or replica gun should have been used by industry standards.Photos and videos of the rehearsal, including moments before the deadly shooting, showed Baldwin with his finger inside the trigger guard and on the trigger while “manipulating” the pistol’s hammer, investigators said, noting that an FBI analysis shows the pistol could not be fired without pressing the trigger.Baldwin, who has described the killing as a tragic accident, said he was told the .45-caliber revolver was safe. The 64-year-old actor has sought to clear his name by suing people involved in handling and supplying the loaded gun.Baldwin said in his lawsuit that, while working on camera angles with Hutchins, he pointed the gun in her direction and pulled back and released the hammer of the weapon, which discharged.Defense attorney Jason Bowles, who represents Gutierrez-Reed, said the charges are the result of a “flawed investigation” and an “inaccurate understanding of the full facts.”The decision to charge Baldwin marks a stunning turn of events for an A-list actor whose 40-year career included the early blockbuster “The Hunt for Red October” and a starring role in the sitcom “30 Rock,” as well as iconic appearances in Martin Scorsese’s “The Departed” and a film adaptation of David Mamet’s “Glengary Glen Ross.” In recent years, Baldwin was known for his impression of former President Donald Trump on “Saturday Night Live.”Prosecutors said a proposed plea agreement signed by assistant director David Halls, who oversaw safety on set, has not yet been approved by a judge and cannot be published.Halls had agreed to plead guilty in the negligent use of a deadly weapon, explaining that he may have handled the gun improperly before it was given to Baldwin, prosecutors said.___AP Entertainment writer Andrew Dalton in Los Angeles contributed to this report.",2023/02/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797314,"Australia targets Myanmar, Iran with economic sanctions","Australia on Wednesday announced targeted financial sanctions and travel bans against “individuals responsible for egregious human rights abuses” in Myanmar two years after a military junta seized power in the Southeast Asian country.Australia also imposed additional sanctions on Iranian individuals and entities over “abhorrent abuses of human rights,” a government statement said.The Myanmar sanctions target 16 members of the military’s governing regime and two military-controlled entities, the government said. The entities are Myanmar Economic Public Holdings Ltd. and Myanmar Economic Corp.Two successive Australian governments had resisted calls to impose sanctions on Myanmar since the military takeover on Feb. 1, 2021, while Sydney economist Sean Turnell, an adviser to Myanmar’s elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi, was detained by the military.Turnell was sentenced to three years in prison for violating Myanmar’s official secrets law and immigration law but was released in November as part of a broader prisoner amnesty and deported.But the junta issued a decree in December that has circulated on social media, annulling his amnesty and ordering him to appear in a Myanmar court for spreading “misinformation” in the media.Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said in a statement last week the government was “deeply concerned” that Myanmar had annulled Turnell’s amnesty and issued a subpoena for him to appear in court.“The Australian government never accepted the basis of Prof. Turnell’s detention, nor the charges against him, and we are disappointed that he is now being asked to answer for an undefined offence following his release from detention,” the statement said.Turnell has advocated Australian sanctions against Myanmar since his release.“Sanctions would cause negligible-to-zero effect on the average person in Myanmar and nothing compared to the suffering that’s occurred under the junta,” Turnell told The Australian newspaper before the sanctions were announced.The new sanctions against Iran target individuals and entities involved in the violent crackdown on protests since 22-year-old Mahsa Amini died in September last year while being held by the morality police.The sanctions also target individuals and entities involved in supplying drones to Russia. Russia has targeted Ukrainian civilians and civilian infrastructure with Iranian-made drones, the government said.“Australia stands with the people of Myanmar, the people of Iran and with the people of Ukraine,” the statement said.",2023/02/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797315,Day of disruption in UK as up to half a million join walkout,"LONDON (AP) — Thousands of schools in the U.K. are closing some or all of their classrooms, train services will be paralyzed and delays are expected at airports Wednesday in what’s shaping up to be the biggest day of industrial action Britain has seen in more than a decade, as unions step up pressure on the government to demand better pay amid a cost-of-living crisis.The Trades Union Congress, a federation of unions, estimated that up to half a million workers, including teachers, university staff, civil servants, border officials and train and bus drivers, will walk out of their jobs across the country.More action, including by nurses and ambulance workers, is planned for the coming days and weeks.Britons have endured months of disruptions to their daily lives as a bitter dispute over pay and work conditions drags on between unions and the government. But Wednesday’s strikes mark an escalation of disruptive action across multiple key industries.The last time the country saw mass walkouts on this scale was in 2011, when well over 1 million public sector workers staged a one-day strike in a dispute over pensions.Union bosses say that despite some pay rises — such as a 5% offer the government proposed to teachers — wages in the public sector have failed to keep pace with soaring inflation, effectively meaning workers have been taking a pay cut.The Trades Union Congress said Wednesday the average public sector worker is 203 pounds ($250) a month worse off compared with 2010, once inflation has been taken into account.Inflation in the U.K. stands at 10.5%, the highest in 40 years, driven by skyrocketing food and energy costs. While some expect price rises to slow down this year, Britain’s economic outlook remains grim. On Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund said that Britain will be the only major economy to contract this year, performing worse even than sanction-hit Russia.The National Education Union said some 23,000 schools will be affected Wednesday, with an estimated 85% fully or partially closed. Others also on strike range from museum workers and London bus drivers to coastguards and border officials manning passport control booths at airports.“It's everybody out ... of course there's going to be some disruption and some queues,” Phil Douglas, director-general of Border Force, told reporters.Mick Whelan, general secretary of train drivers union ASLEF, said the government must now listen to workers' demands.“Everybody knows somebody working somewhere that’s out on strike, about to go on strike or being balloted for strike action,"" he said. “Quite simply, the government has now got to listen – the people in this country are speaking, and they’re speaking volumes that they want a cost-of-living increase.”Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's office acknowledged that Wednesday's wave of walkouts will cause “significant disruption” to people, and maintained that “negotiations rather than picket lines are the right approach."" But union leaders say the government has refused to negotiate and offer enough to halt the strikes.Unions have also been angered by the government's plans to introduce a new law aiming to curb strike disruptions by enforcing minimum service levels in key sectors, including health and transport.Lawmakers on Monday backed the bill, which has been criticized by the unions as an attack on the right to strike.On Wednesday thousands of people are expected to take part in protests against the bill in London and other cities.",2023/02/01,146,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797316,"NATO chief wants more 'friends' as Russia, China move closer","TOKYO (AP) — China's growing assertiveness and collaboration with Russia poses a threat not only to Asia but also to Europe, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Wednesday as he sought stronger cooperation and more “friends” for NATO in the Indo-Pacific region.Stoltenberg said China is increasingly investing in nuclear weapons and long-range missiles without providing transparency or engaging in meaningful dialogue on arms control for atomic weapons, while escalating coercion of its neighbors and threats against Taiwan, the self-ruled island it claims as its own territory.“The fact that Russia and China are coming closer and the significant investments by China and new advanced military capabilities just underlines that China poses a threat, poses a challenge also to NATO allies,” Stoltenberg told an audience at Keio University in Tokyo. “Security is not regional but global.""“NATO needs to make sure we have friends,” he said. “It is important to work more closely with our partners in the Indo-Pacific.”China is increasingly working with Russia and they lead an “authoritarian pushback” against the rules-based, open and democratic international order, he said.Stoltenberg said NATO does not regard China as an adversary or seek confrontation, and that the alliance will continue to engage with China in areas of common interest, such as climate change.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning defended China as “a force for regional and global peace and stability” and criticized NATO for labeling China a threat and for expanding its military ties to Asia.“NATO has constantly sought to reach beyond its traditional defense zone and scope, strengthen military and security ties with Asia Pacific countries and played up China’s threats,” Mao said. “I would like to stress that the Asia-Pacific is not a battlefield for the geopolitical contest and does not welcome the Cold War mentality and bloc confrontation.”Stoltenberg and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida held talks Tuesday and agreed to step up their partnership in security in cyberspace, space, defense and other areas.Besides Japan, NATO is also strengthening “practical cooperation” with Australia, New Zealand and South Korea in maritime cybersecurity and other areas and stepping up participation of their leaders and ministers in NATO meetings, he said.Kishida on Tuesday announced Japan’s plans to open a representative office at NATO.Japan, already a close ally of the United States, has in recent years expanded its military ties with other Indo-Pacific nations as well as with Britain, Europe and NATO amid growing security threats from China and North Korea.Tokyo was quick to join in U.S.-led economic sanctions against Russia’s war in Ukraine and provided humanitarian aid and non-combative defense equipment for Ukrainians. Japan fears that Russian aggression in Europe could be reflected in Asia, where concerns are growing over increasing Chinese assertiveness and escalating tensions over its claim to Taiwan.Stoltenberg arrived in Japan late Monday from South Korea, where he called for Seoul to provide direct military support to Ukraine to help it fight off the prolonged Russian invasion.North Korea condemned Stoltenberg’s visits to South Korea and Japan, saying that NATO was trying to put its “military boots in the region” to pressure America’s Asian allies into providing weapons to Ukraine.North Korea also criticized increasing cooperation between NATO and U.S. allies in Asia as a process to create an “Asian version of NATO,” saying it would raise tensions in the region.___AP video producer Liu Zheng in Beijing contributed to this report.",2023/02/01,251,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797317,Radioactive capsule that fell off truck found in Australia,"PERTH, Australia (AP) — Authorities in Western Australia on Wednesday recovered a tiny but dangerous radioactive capsule that fell off a truck while being transported along a 1,400-kilometer (870-mile) Outback highway last month in what an official said was like finding the needle in the haystack.Officials said the capsule the size of a pea was found south of the mining town of Newman on the Great Northern Highway. It was detected by a search vehicle travelling at 70 kilometers (43 miles) per hour when specialist equipment picked up radiation emitting from the capsule.Portable search equipment was then used to locate it 2 meters (6.5 feet) from the side of the road.“This is an extraordinary result ... they have quite literally found the needle in the haystack,” said Emergency Services Minister Stephen Dawson.Chief Health Officer Andy Robertson said the capsule did not appear to have moved and no injuries had been reported.It contains the caesium 137 ceramic source, commonly used in radiation gauges, which emits dangerous amounts of radiation, equivalent of receiving 10 X-rays in an hour. It could cause skin burns and prolonged exposure could cause cancer.Search crews had spent six days scouring the entire length of the highway.The capsule measures 8 millimeters by 6 millimeters (0.31 inches by 0.24 inches), and people have been warned it could have unknowingly become lodged in their car’s tires.A government investigation has been launched into how the capsule fell off the truck and a report will be provided to the health minister.Defense officials were verifying the identification of the capsule, which has been placed into a lead container for safety. It will be stored in a secure location in Newman before being transported to a health facility in the city of Perth.The capsule got lost while being transported between a desert mine site and Perth on Jan. 10. The truck transporting the capsule arrived at a Perth depot on Jan. 16. Emergency services were notified of the missing capsule on Jan. 25.The chief executive of the mining giant Rio Tinto Iron Ore, Simon Trott, has apologized for the incident and expressed gratitude for the find.“A pretty incredible recovery when you think of the distances involved, and also the remoteness of the terrain, and I think that really speaks to the tenacity of all those who were involved in the search,” Trott said.“The simple fact is this device should never have been lost. We’re sorry that that has occurred and we’re sorry for the concern that that has caused within the Western Australian community,” Trott added.Robertson said the investigation of the mishap could lead to a prosecution.“We have the ability to prosecute under the Radiation Safety Act and we will certainly look at such prosecutions, and we’ve done that in the past,” Robertson said.Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said a 1,000 Australian dollar ($708) fine was an inadequate maximum penalty for mishandling radioactive material.“It shouldn’t have been lost, that’s the first thing. And second, yeah of course that figure is ridiculously low,” Albanese said.Dawson said the state government was reviewing the penalties under the Radiation Safety Act.",2023/02/01,183,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797322,Race to vaccinate rare wild monkeys gives hope for survival,"SILVA JARDIM, Brazil (AP) — In a small lab nestled in Brazil’s Atlantic Forest, researchers with gloved hands and masked faces cradle four tiny golden monkeys so a veterinarian can delicately slide a needle under the thin skin of each sedated animal’s belly. 

            The next morning, biologist Andréia Martins brings them to the precise spot where they were caught. She opens the wire cages and the monkeys dart out, hopping to a tree or the ground, ascending the canopy and regrouping as a family. They chatter noisily as they vanish into the rainforest.

            This brief, strange encounter with humanity has been for the sake of their own health – and the survival of their kind. These endangered wild monkeys, called golden lion tamarins, have now been vaccinated against yellow fever, part of a pathbreaking campaign to save a threatened species. 











            “Vaccinating wild animals for the sake of animals, not to protect humans, is novel,” said Luís Paulo Ferraz, president of the nonprofit Golden Lion Tamarin Association. 

            When yellow fever began to spread in Brazil in 2016, resulting in more than 2,000 human infections and around 750 deaths, it also quickly killed a third of the highly vulnerable tamarins, the majority of them in just a few months. So scientists in Brazil customized a yellow fever vaccine for the endangered monkeys.

            The inoculation campaign started in 2021, and already more than 300 tamarins have been vaccinated. The first such effort in Brazil — and one of the first worldwide — it raises vital questions about how far to go to save a species from extinction. 

            One of the traditional adages of conservation is “Leave it be.” But in an age when every corner of the globe is touched by human influence – from melting icebergs to fragmented forests to plastic-filled oceans – a new generation of scientists and environmentalists is increasingly calling for more interventionist approaches to save wild animals and ecosystems.

            “There are people who say we shouldn’t touch nature, that we shouldn’t alter anything. But really, there are no pristine natural habitats left,” said Tony Goldberg, a disease ecologist and veterinarian at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who supports vaccinating wildlife when it’s safe and practical. “People are waking up to the magnitude of the problem and realizing they have to do something.” 

            Carlos R. Ruiz-Miranda, a conservation biologist at State University of Northern Rio de Janeiro, is among the scientists who have worked for more than three decades to protect the golden lion tamarins, twice going to their rescue when extinction threatened. He says the vaccinations are the only option left: “Is it too extreme? Give me another alternative.” 

            “We have to intervene when it’s a human-borne conservation risk, if you’re going to have an environment with wildlife,” said Ruiz-Miranda.

            Viruses have always abounded in nature. But humans have drastically changed the conditions and impacts of how they spread in wildlife. Epidemics can travel across oceans and borders faster than ever, and species already diminished by habitat loss and other threats are more at risk of being wiped out by outbreaks.

            “Human activity is absolutely accelerating disease spread in non-human populations,” said Jeff Sebo, an environmental researcher at New York University, who was not involved in the Brazil project. 

            But there are risks. It’s tough to decide which species get the attention and resources needed for survival. In Brazil, a political climate of anxiety about the COVID-19 pandemic and misinformation about vaccines in general has caused delays. Yet if the scientists get it right, they could be pioneers to show what’s possible to save threatened wildlife. 

            ___

            The story of the golden lion tamarins is an epic saga – one that Marcos da Silva Freire, a longtime Brazilian health official, has experienced firsthand.

            When Freire was a child in the 1960s, he spent weekends at his family’s property in the Atlantic Forest. But he never saw golden lion tamarins. 

            Around that time, Brazilian primatologist Adelmar Faria Coimbra-Filho first raised alarms about the shrinking population of the tamarins. Habitat loss and poaching for the pet trade had reduced their numbers to as low as 200 in the wild. 

            Southeastern Brazil was once covered by the rainforest, but today the undulating landscape is an uneven checkerboard of dark green jungle and grassy cow pastures – only 12% of this rainforest remains. 

            Yet it’s the only place in the world that wild golden lion tamarins live. 

            The effort to save the charismatic monkeys – famous for their copper-colored fur and small inquisitive faces framed by silken manes – led to a pioneering captive breeding program, coordinated among around 150 zoos worldwide, including the Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington, D.C. Many of those animals were then carefully released in Brazil starting in 1984, in cooperation with local landowners. 

            When Freire’s father, a landowner, was approached by researchers, he told them to coordinate with his son, then a veterinary student in his mid-20s. 

            On a clear July morning, Freire walks along a dirt road on his property, shafts of light splintering through palm fronds. “The first monkeys were released near here, behind that hill,” he said, pointing from the shore of a small lake, recalling the afternoon nearly 40 years ago.

            He smiled when he saw some of their descendants, two monkeys scampering along a swaying vine. They jumped to a high branch, and soon vanished into a kaleidoscope of green. 

            Reintroduction was a learning process, for both the scientists and the monkeys, he recalled. Usually it was the second generation, not the first, that learned to be successful again in the wild. 

            Thanks to that effort – and subsequent campaigns to replant and connect parcels of rainforest – the population of tamarins slowly recovered, reaching around 3,700 by 2014. 

            But any celebration was premature.

            ___ 

            One misty winter morning, Andréia Martins pulled on a camouflage jacket, rubber boots and a face mask, and tucked her machete into her belt. She followed a narrow path through the rainforest, stopping periodically to whistle in imitation of monkey contact calls.

            Martins has been tracking golden lion tamarins in the rainforest for nearly forty years. The longtime biologist for the Golden Lion Tamarin Association can spot the tiny shimmer of golden fur among a green canopy and recognize more than 18 distinct vocalizations – from the specific calls of alpha males to their mates, to varying sounds to alert young monkeys to different types of food and predators. 

            On this trek, she recorded the noisy encounter between two monkey families, a dozen or so animals chattering loudly to proclaim territory. 

            It’s because of her patient fieldwork, recording detailed population data for four decades, that researchers were even able to track how many tamarins were killed by the yellow fever virus when it began circulating. 

            After the first lab-confirmed death of a tamarin from yellow fever in 2018, her team’s census revealed the population of wild tamarins had dropped from 3,700 to around 2,500. 

            Inside the Poço das Antas Biological Reserve, one of the largest tracts of continuous forest they inhabit, the death toll was even steeper: A population of around 400 tamarins dropped to just 32. “They just weren’t there anymore,” she recalled.

            The tamarins had fallen victim again to human encroachment. From the top of a wooden watchtower, it’s possible to see swathes of replanted rainforest, as well as the newly expanded BR101 highway bringing a steady stream of traffic into the region.

            “This epidemic moved very quickly from north to south, across the country – no wildlife does that,” said Ruiz-Miranda. “It’s people. They cross vast distances in buses, trains, planes. They bring the disease with them.” Yellow fever is transmitted by mosquitoes, he explained, but highly mobile infected people spread the disease much farther and faster than insects alone.

            “We lost 32% of the wild population. It was a tragedy – it showed us how vulnerable this small population is,” said Ferraz, of the nonprofit Golden Lion Tamarin Association. 

            “We realized that in five years, we could lose the entire population if we did nothing.”

            ___

            By a twist of fate, Marcos da Silva Freire had gone on to specialize in viruses. At the time of the yellow fever outbreak, he was a deputy director of technological development at Brazil’s Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, which oversees vaccine diagnostics and production in the country. 

            Conservationists who had toiled for decades to protect the monkeys were sharply divided over whether to vaccinate them. Some were hopeful the virus wouldn’t impact the monkeys; others worried that any kind of novel intervention would be too risky.

            But Freire decided to test an idea. He arranged with the Primate Center of Rio de Janeiro to begin trials of different doses of yellow fever vaccines on about 60 monkeys, close relatives of the tamarins, in January 2018. 

            A year later, he checked the level of antibodies in their blood – the vaccine appeared to work, without negative side effects. 

            Freire started to draw up a plan for the tamarins. “The idea is to vaccinate 500 animals,” he said. “For 150 animals, the goal is to vaccinate, then collect blood samples later – to test the safety and efficacy.” 

            The biologists had already honed a technique for luring the wild monkeys into baited cages. ""It sounds like a cliche, but monkeys eat bananas,"" said the scientist Ruiz-Miranda.

            But seeking official permissions for something that had no precedent in Brazil, vaccinating a wild species, was not a simple process. And then COVID-19 hit.

            When the team finally got government approval to begin vaccinating wild monkeys, Freire supervised the first rounds of shots. 

            So far, they’ve vaccinated more than 300 tamarins and detected no adverse side effects. When they’ve caught and retested monkeys, 90% to 95% have shown immunity -- similar to the efficacy of human vaccines. 

            The outbreak appears to have subsided, and the monitored monkey population has stabilized overall and even increased a little inside the Poço das Antas Biological Reserve. And now the golden lion tamarins have a better shot at surviving as symbols of the Atlantic Forest. 

            ___

            While authorities elsewhere have inoculated animals to safeguard human health – vaccinating feral dogs and wild animals such as raccoons for rabies and other diseases – it’s still very rare for scientists to administer vaccine injections to directly protect an endangered species. 

            There was the campaign to vaccinate endangered Hawaiian monk seals against a strain of morbillivirus, launched in 2016. And rabies vaccines have been administered orally, hidden in food, to the endangered Ethiopian wolf and a few other species. 

            Martin Gilbert, a wildlife veterinarian and epidemiologist at Cornell University, has studied another potential vaccination campaign by modeling the number of Amur tigers in Russia that would need to be inoculated to provide protection against canine distemper. “Infectious diseases are presenting a conservation threat to wild species, and these are only going to increase as populations become more fragmented and isolated,” he said. 

            Of special concern are cases when encounters between humans or domestic animals and wildlife directly pass diseases to threatened species, as with respiratory diseases and great apes. Several studies have shown that chimpanzees that live near human settlements have higher rates of multiple diseases.

            “There’s a great debate now about whether it’s a ticking time bomb before wild great ape populations get infected with COVID, and it sweeps through groups and kills many apes,” said the University of Wisconsin-Madison’s Goldberg. 

            Still, other scientists urge caution for any kind of new intervention. 

            “What are the unintended consequences of vaccination? You can’t always be certain,” said Jacob Negrey, a biologist and primatologist at Wake Forest University’s School of Medicine. “That would be my major hesitation – have we adequately controlled for every last variable?” 

            James Dietz, a biologist and president of the U.S.-based nonprofit Save the Golden Lion Tamarins, was initially wary of the vaccination campaign in Brazil. “When we choose to vaccinate wild animals against a disease, we may be giving them an advantage over non-vaccinated animals – and by doing that, we are acting potentially against natural selection that would, over time, be acting to improve the genetics of the species,” he said. 

            But in the end, he overcame those hesitations. “It was only when I realized the scope of mortality that I realized we had to do this,” he said. “And I’m very happy with the direction we took.”

            There are other reasons to be cautious. While golden lion tamarins are tiny – weighing less than 2 pounds – and can be lured into cages with banana bait, it’s harder with large carnivores. “It’s exceedingly difficult to capture wild tigers and provide a vaccine,” said Dale Miquelle, who leads the global tiger program at nonprofit Wildlife Conservation Society. 

            Still, his organization recommends that “for small and highly vulnerable populations, it’s a good idea to do vaccinations” against canine distemper. No one has tried yet. 

            In Australia, scientists have applied for permits to begin a field trial of vaccinating wild koalas against chlamydia, which infects up to 80% of animals in some populations, causing death and lowering fertility. 

            The potential downside? “Catching koalas is really stressful on the animals,” said Samuel Phillips, a biologist at Australia’s University of the Sunshine Coast. “It’s a fine juggling act between causing stress on them and trying to help.” 

            But increasingly, he and other scientists feel that through habitat loss and other environmental changes, “We have decreased their population so much that it’s already at a critical point.”

            His conclusion: “We need to do more to help them survive.”

Usually it was the second generation, not the first, that learned to be successful again in the wild.Thanks to that effort – and subsequent campaigns to replant and connect parcels of rainforest – the population of tamarins slowly recovered, reaching around 3,700 by 2014.But any celebration was premature.___One misty winter morning, Andréia Martins pulled on a camouflage jacket, rubber boots and a face mask, and tucked her machete into her belt. She followed a narrow path through the rainforest, stopping periodically to whistle in imitation of monkey contact calls.Martins has been tracking golden lion tamarins in the rainforest for nearly forty years. The longtime biologist for the Golden Lion Tamarin Association can spot the tiny shimmer of golden fur among a green canopy and recognize more than 18 distinct vocalizations – from the specific calls of alpha males to their mates, to varying sounds to alert young monkeys to different types of food and predators.On this trek, she recorded the noisy encounter between two monkey families, a dozen or so animals chattering loudly to proclaim territory.It’s because of her patient fieldwork, recording detailed population data for four decades, that researchers were even able to track how many tamarins were killed by the yellow fever virus when it began circulating.After the first lab-confirmed death of a tamarin from yellow fever in 2018, her team’s census revealed the population of wild tamarins had dropped from 3,700 to around 2,500.Inside the Poço das Antas Biological Reserve, one of the largest tracts of continuous forest they inhabit, the death toll was even steeper: A population of around 400 tamarins dropped to just 32. “They just weren’t there anymore,” she recalled.The tamarins had fallen victim again to human encroachment. From the top of a wooden watchtower, it’s possible to see swathes of replanted rainforest, as well as the newly expanded BR101 highway bringing a steady stream of traffic into the region.“This epidemic moved very quickly from north to south, across the country – no wildlife does that,” said Ruiz-Miranda. “It’s people. They cross vast distances in buses, trains, planes. They bring the disease with them.” Yellow fever is transmitted by mosquitoes, he explained, but highly mobile infected people spread the disease much farther and faster than insects alone.“We lost 32% of the wild population. It was a tragedy – it showed us how vulnerable this small population is,” said Ferraz, of the nonprofit Golden Lion Tamarin Association.“We realized that in five years, we could lose the entire population if we did nothing.”___By a twist of fate, Marcos da Silva Freire had gone on to specialize in viruses. At the time of the yellow fever outbreak, he was a deputy director of technological development at Brazil’s Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, which oversees vaccine diagnostics and production in the country.Conservationists who had toiled for decades to protect the monkeys were sharply divided over whether to vaccinate them. Some were hopeful the virus wouldn’t impact the monkeys; others worried that any kind of novel intervention would be too risky.But Freire decided to test an idea. He arranged with the Primate Center of Rio de Janeiro to begin trials of different doses of yellow fever vaccines on about 60 monkeys, close relatives of the tamarins, in January 2018.A year later, he checked the level of antibodies in their blood – the vaccine appeared to work, without negative side effects.Freire started to draw up a plan for the tamarins. “The idea is to vaccinate 500 animals,” he said. “For 150 animals, the goal is to vaccinate, then collect blood samples later – to test the safety and efficacy.”The biologists had already honed a technique for luring the wild monkeys into baited cages. ""It sounds like a cliche, but monkeys eat bananas,"" said the scientist Ruiz-Miranda.But seeking official permissions for something that had no precedent in Brazil, vaccinating a wild species, was not a simple process. And then COVID-19 hit.When the team finally got government approval to begin vaccinating wild monkeys, Freire supervised the first rounds of shots.So far, they’ve vaccinated more than 300 tamarins and detected no adverse side effects. When they’ve caught and retested monkeys, 90% to 95% have shown immunity -- similar to the efficacy of human vaccines.The outbreak appears to have subsided, and the monitored monkey population has stabilized overall and even increased a little inside the Poço das Antas Biological Reserve. And now the golden lion tamarins have a better shot at surviving as symbols of the Atlantic Forest.___While authorities elsewhere have inoculated animals to safeguard human health – vaccinating feral dogs and wild animals such as raccoons for rabies and other diseases – it’s still very rare for scientists to administer vaccine injections to directly protect an endangered species.There was the campaign to vaccinate endangered Hawaiian monk seals against a strain of morbillivirus, launched in 2016. And rabies vaccines have been administered orally, hidden in food, to the endangered Ethiopian wolf and a few other species.Martin Gilbert, a wildlife veterinarian and epidemiologist at Cornell University, has studied another potential vaccination campaign by modeling the number of Amur tigers in Russia that would need to be inoculated to provide protection against canine distemper. “Infectious diseases are presenting a conservation threat to wild species, and these are only going to increase as populations become more fragmented and isolated,” he said.Of special concern are cases when encounters between humans or domestic animals and wildlife directly pass diseases to threatened species, as with respiratory diseases and great apes. Several studies have shown that chimpanzees that live near human settlements have higher rates of multiple diseases.“There’s a great debate now about whether it’s a ticking time bomb before wild great ape populations get infected with COVID, and it sweeps through groups and kills many apes,” said the University of Wisconsin-Madison’s Goldberg.Still, other scientists urge caution for any kind of new intervention.“What are the unintended consequences of vaccination? You can’t always be certain,” said Jacob Negrey, a biologist and primatologist at Wake Forest University’s School of Medicine. “That would be my major hesitation – have we adequately controlled for every last variable?”James Dietz, a biologist and president of the U.S.-based nonprofit Save the Golden Lion Tamarins, was initially wary of the vaccination campaign in Brazil. “When we choose to vaccinate wild animals against a disease, we may be giving them an advantage over non-vaccinated animals – and by doing that, we are acting potentially against natural selection that would, over time, be acting to improve the genetics of the species,” he said.But in the end, he overcame those hesitations. “It was only when I realized the scope of mortality that I realized we had to do this,” he said. “And I’m very happy with the direction we took.”There are other reasons to be cautious. While golden lion tamarins are tiny – weighing less than 2 pounds – and can be lured into cages with banana bait, it’s harder with large carnivores. “It’s exceedingly difficult to capture wild tigers and provide a vaccine,” said Dale Miquelle, who leads the global tiger program at nonprofit Wildlife Conservation Society.Still, his organization recommends that “for small and highly vulnerable populations, it’s a good idea to do vaccinations” against canine distemper. No one has tried yet.In Australia, scientists have applied for permits to begin a field trial of vaccinating wild koalas against chlamydia, which infects up to 80% of animals in some populations, causing death and lowering fertility.The potential downside? “Catching koalas is really stressful on the animals,” said Samuel Phillips, a biologist at Australia’s University of the Sunshine Coast. “It’s a fine juggling act between causing stress on them and trying to help.”But increasingly, he and other scientists feel that through habitat loss and other environmental changes, “We have decreased their population so much that it’s already at a critical point.”His conclusion: “We need to do more to help them survive.”___Follow Christina Larson on Twitter at @larsonchristina___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797323,"US winter storm causes 3rd day of dangerous, icy conditions","OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — A deadly storm system lashed a large swath of the southern U.S. with bands of sleet and snow for a third day on Wednesday, grounding an additional 2,300 flights, leaving hundreds of thousands without power, forcing school closures and making already treacherous driving conditions worse.

            Watches and warnings about wintry conditions were issued for an area stretching West Texas' border with Mexico through Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana, and into western Tennessee and northern Mississippi. Several rounds of mixed precipitation, including freezing rain and sleet, were in store for many areas throughout the day, meaning some places could get hit multiple times, forecasters said.

            “It actually looks like it's going to be getting worse again across Texas, it is already a pretty big area of freezing rain across western and southwestern Texas,” said Bob Oravec, a lead National Weather Service forecaster based in Camp Springs, Maryland.











            Oravec said the icy weather is expected to move northeastward across parts of Oklahoma and Arkansas into western Tennessee and northern Mississippi before it starts to dissipate.

            “By later in the day on Thursday it should be pretty much done, and all the … precipitation will be well downstream across parts of the South and where it will be mostly heavy rain,” Oravec said.

            By late Wednesday morning, 2,300 U.S. flights had been canceled, including three-quarters of the flights at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport and more than two-thirds at Dallas Love Field, according to the flight tracking service FlightAware.com. Dallas-Forth Worth International is American Airlines’ biggest hub, and Love Field is a major base for Southwest Airlines.

            Many flights were also canceled at other airports, including in San Antonio, the Texas capital of Austin, and Nashville, Tennessee, compounding frustrations caused by the nearly 2,000 cancellations on Tuesday and roughly 1,100 on Monday.

            Because of the storm, the Detroit Pistons were unable to fly home following their game Monday against the Dallas Mavericks, and the NBA postponed the Pistons' Wednesday night home game against the Washington Wizards.

            Many schools throughout Arkansas have announced they would be closed on Thursday. School systems in Dallas; Austin, Texas; and Memphis, Tennessee, also canceled classes for Thursday.

            In Texas, more than 350,000 customers were without power Wednesday afternoon as trees — heavy with ice — buckled onto power lines, according to PowerOutage, a website that tracks utility reports.

            More than half of those outages were in Austin, where the city’s utility warned residents who had been without electricity for 10 hours or longer that lights and heat may not come back on until Thursday. Overnight low temperatures were expected to fall to 33 degrees in Austin, with more chances for freezing rain, according to the National Weather Service. Austin Energy asked customers to prepare emergency plans and relocate before dusk if needed.

            Pablo Vegas, who heads the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, vowed that the state's electrical grid and natural gas supply would be reliable and that there wouldn't be a repeat of the February 2021 blackouts, when the grid was on the brink of total failure.

            As the ice and sleet enveloped Memphis, Tennessee, Memphis-Shelby County Schools announced it would cancel classes Wednesday due to freezing rain and hazardous road conditions. The school system serves about 100,000 students. The National Civil Rights Museum in Memphis also closed due to the weather.

            Also in Memphis, the icy weather delayed the funeral service for Tyre Nichols, who died following a brutal beating by police during a traffic stop. But more icy weather was moving in from the southwest just ahead of the funeral, which was pushed back a few hours to Wednesday afternoon.

            ""The third and FINAL round of freezing rain and/or sleet will start this afternoon,” the National Weather Service's Memphis office posted on social media Wednesday morning. The leading edge of a wintry mix of precipitation was about 25 miles (40 kilometers) south of Memphis late Wednesday morning, radar showed.

            The Dallas school district, which serves about 145,000 students, also canceled classes Wednesday.

            Emergency responders rushed to hundreds of auto collisions across Texas on Tuesday and Republican Gov. Greg Abbott urged people not to drive. At least six people have died on slick Texas roads since Monday, including a triple fatality crash Tuesday near Brownfield, about 40 miles (64 kilometers) southwest of Lubbock.

            Two Texas law officers, including a state trooper who was struck by a vehicle while investigating a crash on Interstate 45 southeast of Dallas, were seriously injured, authorities said.

            In Arkansas, Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders declared a state of emergency Tuesday because of icy conditions. Her declaration cited the “likelihood of numerous downed power lines” and said road conditions have created a backlog of deliveries by commercial drivers.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797324,Top US official urges WHO to address sexual misconduct,"LONDON (AP) — A top U.S. health official urged the World Health Organization to address allegations first reported by The Associated Press that one of its doctors repeatedly engaged in sexual misconduct.

            “There are many of us who stand with survivors and stand with those who identify as victims and are truly committed, but also frustrated by where things have stood to date,"" Loyce Pace, assistant secretary for global affairs at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, told a meeting of WHO's Executive Board on Tuesday. 

            Last month, the AP reported that a WHO doctor accused of sexually assaulting a woman at a Berlin conference in October was flagged to senior WHO directors years ago for allegedly harassing another staffer. The earlier allegation didn't result in any significant consequences for the doctor, Temo Waqanivalu, who was preparing to run for regional director of the Western Pacific, with help from WHO colleagues and the presidential office in his home country of Fiji. 











            WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told the meeting that a probe into the October incident had been completed.

            “We regret that the media identified the alleged perpetrator,” Tedros said during a discussion on preventing sexual abuse. There are no plans to publicly release the investigation into Waqanivalu's reported misconduct.

            “If the allegations are substantiated, disciplinary action will be taken,” Tedros said. 

            Speaking to the WHO board, Pace cited the issue of sexual misconduct by a staffer who reportedly “had a record of prior accusations,” saying the case “really needs to be addressed by WHO.”

            ""It's important to many of us who have faced this personally in our experience working in the global health and development space, and not just in terms of earlier in our careers, but even now,” she added.

            According to confidential documents obtained by the AP, senior WHO directors were informed of a sexual harassment allegation made against Waqanivalu in 2018. The accuser was later informed that pursuing a formal investigation might not be the best option for her. Waqanivalu was later given an informal warning that didn't cite the woman who made the claim or his specific behavior.

            In his interviews with WHO investigators, Waqanivalu “categorically” denied that he had ever sexually assaulted anyone. He declined to comment to the AP. 

            In recent years, WHO has been plagued by numerous reports of misconduct. In May 2021, the AP reported that senior WHO managers were informed of sex abuse allegations during an Ebola outbreak in Congo but did little to stop it. A panel appointed by WHO later found that more than 80 workers under WHO’s direction sexually abused women. 

            No senior WHO officials tied to the exploitation have been fired. Tedros said Tuesday that three WHO staffers who had been on administrative leave following the abuse allegations had now returned to work, after a U.N. investigation disputed findings by an independent panel that they had engaged in “managerial misconduct.”

            At the session on Tuesday, a Fijian delegate to WHO said all individuals accused of sexual misconduct should be treated fairly. She said the officials at WHO who had leaked “highly confidential information” should be held responsible. “Due process must be respected and all individuals involved must be treated fairly,” the official said. 

            The Western Pacific regional director Waqanivalu was seeking to replace at WHO was put on leave in August, months after the AP reported that numerous staffers had accused him of racist and abusive behavior that compromised the U.N. agency’s response to COVID-19.LONDON (AP) — A top U.S. health official urged the World Health Organization to address allegations first reported by The Associated Press that one of its doctors repeatedly engaged in sexual misconduct.“There are many of us who stand with survivors and stand with those who identify as victims and are truly committed, but also frustrated by where things have stood to date,"" Loyce Pace, assistant secretary for global affairs at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, told a meeting of WHO's Executive Board on Tuesday.Last month, the AP reported that a WHO doctor accused of sexually assaulting a woman at a Berlin conference in October was flagged to senior WHO directors years ago for allegedly harassing another staffer.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797326,"Ireland celebrates 'matron saint' with prayers, new holiday","KILDARE, Ireland (AP) — St. Patrick has long received the attention and the big parades, but another patron saint of Ireland is making a 21st century comeback.

            St. Brigid of Kildare, a younger contemporary of St. Patrick, is quietly and steadily gaining a following, in Ireland and abroad. Devotees see Brigid, and the ancient Irish goddess whose name and attributes she shares, as emblematic of feminine spirituality and empowerment.

            For the first time this year, Ireland is observing a public holiday in honor of St. Brigid’s Day and Imbolc, an ancient pagan holy day associated with the goddess Brigid and heralding the coming of spring. The official holiday is Monday, but celebrations began in earnest this week.











            The holiday designation, the first honoring a woman in Ireland, comes 120 years after St. Patrick got his holiday.

            “The legacy of St. Brigid and its relevance for our world today is not about going back to the fifth century and staying there, but looking at the needs of the world today,” said Sister Rita Minehan, a Roman Catholic sister and one of the founders of Solas Bhride, a center that opened here in 2015 to welcome pilgrims and foster the spirituality inspired by Brigid.

            “Does Brigid have something to say to us today?” said Minehan. “We believe she does.”

            Some are calling Brigid the “matron saint” of Ireland. 

            She is seen as embodying women’s empowerment, environmental care and peacemaking in an Ireland that is increasingly casting off traditional forms of Catholicism. 

            “I think Ireland is ready to celebrate our women and our goddess and our saint,” said Melanie Lynch, founder and CEO of Herstory, which advocated for the holiday. The organization uses arts and education programs to celebrate female exemplars. “You’re talking about a great role model for young girls.”

            Herstory has been sponsoring celebrations around Ireland in recent days -- complete with fire dances and light shows — and a traveling exhibit highlighting women peacemakers in Northern Ireland.

            The holy day also starts the countdown to the 1,500th anniversary of Brigid’s death in 2024. The coming year will include a conference and other events marking the milestone.

            “St Patrick’s Day is obviously iconic around the world,” said the Rev. Philip McKinley, curate of St. Brigid’s Cathedral, an Anglican church that was a derelict medieval ruin until restored in the 19th century. “But now St. Brigid offers this whole new dynamic. She’s a very, very modern saint that speaks to the really cutting-edge issues of our day — gender equality, environmental issues, social care, poverty, peacemaking.” 

            He said pilgrims come to walk on the ground where Brigid walked and founded an earlier wooden sanctuary — a “church of the oak,” or “cill dara” in Irish, giving the name Kildare to this town where she was a prominent abbess of a monastic settlement of men and women. 

            On Tuesday evening, to the backdrop of traditional Irish music played on a concertina and tin whistle, about 150 people gathered around a fire pit and a display of candles in a darkened parking lot in Kildare.

            Many came from the surrounding area, others from as far as Italy and the United States, to mark the eve of the feast day.

            The devotees processed quietly in the dark, some holding lanterns, past a candlelit holy well associated with Brigid. They walked through a light rain up a country road, past the curious stares of horses here in Ireland’s thoroughbred heartland.

            The pilgrims concluded their walk at Solas Bhride (Irish for “light of Brigid”), where they gathered in a circle for prayers for peace, for the environment, for immigrants.

            All this is honoring a saint about whom no biography was written until two centuries after her lifetime, yet who was long honored as “Mary of the Gael.”

            Brigid’s father is said to have been a ruler, her mother enslaved. Brigid likely was named for the goddess venerated by ancient Irish and other Celts.

            Legends associate St. Brigid with healing, fertility, care for living things and peacemaking, according to Lisa Bitel, professor of religion and history at the University of Southern California.

            Brigid’s moment is happening as many Irish are rejecting traditional Roman Catholicism amid fallout over cover-ups of sexual abuse and other scandals, and are seeking alternatives to patriarchal structures.

            “The whole disenchantment with the Catholic Church, the slow seep of women’s rights into Irish society, the idea that you have religious choices — all these things are combining with other factors to give her renewed importance,” Bitel said. 

            Brigid is associated with miracles and legends.

            When a ruler agreed to give her only enough land for her monastery that could fit under her cloak, she miraculously spread it across vast fields, legend says. To a needy man, Brigid gave her father’s jeweled sword to barter for food.

            She traveled, preached, healed. She’s often depicted with images of fire and light. 

            Inspired by her example, the organizers of Solas Bhride called for a moment’s silence — a worldwide Pause for Peace — at midday Wednesday. 

            Lizz Pickard of Colorado is staying at one of the hermitages at Solas Bride this week, the latest of several visits.

            After first learning of the saint from an herbalist in the United States, she has increasingly embraced the values of Brigid, which she sees as focused less on doctrine than on right action – “practicing acts of kindness, acts of service, acts of protection,” she said.

            Solas Bhride was founded by sisters of the Brigidine order, which has largely focused on education since its 19th century founding.

            By the late 20th century, the sisters began discerning their future mission. In 1993, they hosted a peacemaking conference where they ceremonially lit an eternal flame, similar to one reportedly long tended at the medieval monastery.

            “People then started coming to our door,” said Sister Phil O’Shea, center coordinator. “Pilgrim groups, people wanting to sit with the flame, see the flame.”

            To accommodate them, the sisters worked with a team of lay people to open Solas Bhride in 2015. The self-described Christian spirituality center welcomes “people of all faiths and of no faith.”

            The one-story buildings have sparse ornamentation — the main feature is light itself, flowing through large windows even on wintry gray days. In a circular room, pilgrims meditate before the eternal flame.

            “For us, it’s the symbol of what Brigid stood for, carrying that light of Christ in the fifth, sixth century Ireland,” O’Shea said.

            Brigid offers a connection for those who identify with the goddess tradition, Minehan said.

            “She belongs to both worlds,” she said. “She didn’t become a Christian until into her teens. And she would have inherited some of the folklore and some of the attributes of the pre-Christian goddess. And some of those are really lovely attributes.”

            Two churches in Kildare bear Brigid’s name, a Catholic parish and the Anglican cathedral. They were honoring the saint with a joint service Wednesday.

            “There’s something in the whole St. Brigid’s story that’s tapped into people’s imagination and search for spirituality, and there’s great energy there,” said the Rev. Andy Leahy of St. Brigid’s Parish Church. “There’s great energy there.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797327,Free hotel breakfasts are getting bigger and better,"Kimberly Button normally skips breakfast. But on vacation, the hotel breakfast buffet is a highlight.

            She’s drawn to the oatmeal bar, where she transforms bland grains with an array of toppings — chocolate chips, coconut flakes and berries. Sometimes she grabs fruit to take with her and nosh on throughout the day.

            At Disney World, the star of breakfast is Mickey-shaped waffles. When dining at the cafe inside Disney’s Grand Floridian Resort & Spa (which does not offer free breakfast), waffles cost $15 a pop. But for stays at non-Disney properties such as the Fairfield Inn & Suites in Kissimmee, you can indulge in as many Mickey-shaped waffles as you want as part of its complimentary breakfast buffet.











            “I’ve eaten at hotel breakfasts around the world, but the breakfasts in Orlando hotels are the busiest I’ve ever seen,” says Button, who runs the Wanderful World of Travel blog. “When you can get a Mickey-shaped waffle for free, wouldn’t you?”

            SAVING MONEY, TIME AND ENERGY

            Complimentary breakfast is the most frequently used search filter on Hilton’s website, according to the Hilton 2023 Trends Report.

            Free breakfast can be a money-saver, especially for families or larger groups. A $100 room that includes food for four can feel practically free if you’d otherwise pay $25 per person at brunch.

            And then there’s the time savings and convenience. Gone is the anxiety of researching the perfect cafe, only to meet a waitlist after a pricey cab ride there. No debating which restaurant to patronize or which entree to order, as you can try it all at the buffet. And you won’t starve while waiting for your jet-lagged companions to wake up, as you can munch on your own schedule.

            WHEN FREE BREAKFAST ISN’T ALL IT’S CRACKED UP TO BE

            But at some hotels, free breakfast can be mediocre. At others, it’s downright gross.

            Vered DeLeeuw, who worked for seven years as a flight attendant and now runs a healthy recipes blog, has experienced many hotel buffets. She eats low-carb, so she skips pastries. And she’s sworn off bland eggs and greasy sausages. But once she went for a hard-boiled egg, only to find fuzzy green mold all over the bottom.

            “As you can imagine, that incident turned me off for good,” she says.

            But many big hotel brands are making changes to improve their breakfast appeal.

            MORE FLEXIBILITY

            More hotels are doing away with breakfast buffets that have been sitting out too long. Instead, they’re giving travelers credits toward made-to-order food.

            That’s the case for Hilton elite status members. As of last year, Hilton elites who were previously entitled to free breakfast now receive a food and beverage credit at some properties. Hilton says it has received positive feedback from customers who appreciate greater flexibility, choice and control of their food choices. Carb-free folks can swap a pastry for protein, and intermittent fasters can eat on their schedule.

            “Plus, the quality is typically elevated,” says Annie Jones , who owns luxury travel agency Telos Travel. “It also usually means multiple options such as sit-down or grab-and-go.”

            MORE OPTIONS FOR PEOPLE WITH DIETARY RESTRICTIONS

            A 2023 Hilton trend survey cited increasing demand for healthier and animal-free options, such as alternative milks.

            At the end of 2021, some Marriott brands that already offered free breakfast catered to trends like keto and gluten-free diets with new offerings such as a spinach-and-cheese crustless quiche. 

            It also started embracing customization, which makes it easier for people with certain diet restrictions. For example, some properties offer build-your-own breakfast bowls consisting of a base (yogurt, oatmeal or cereal) plus toppings, including granola, pumpkin seeds or coconut.

            DISCOUNTS ON DINING

            
                Hotel prices are significantly higher in 2023 than they were pre-pandemic. Travelers seeking savings on lodging may be able to look beyond sticker price and find deals that save on food — even at hotels that don’t generally offer free breakfast.

            For example, Walt Disney World is offering a rare deal where guests at Disney-owned hotels for certain dates this summer can receive credits ranging from $35 to $150 per room per night, for up to five nights (depending on the dates and room type). Travelers receive credits on a physical card that can be used at participating restaurants within the Walt Disney World Resort.

            $35 could easily cover breakfast for two at a counter service-style restaurant. $150 just about covers a buffet meal for two at Ohana in Disney’s Polynesian Village Resort. There, options include all-you-can-eat pineapple-coconut bread, Hawaiian-style ham with pineapple compote and, yes, Mickey-shaped waffles.

Sometimes she grabs fruit to take with her and nosh on throughout the day.At Disney World, the star of breakfast is Mickey-shaped waffles. When dining at the cafe inside Disney’s Grand Floridian Resort & Spa (which does not offer free breakfast), waffles cost $15 a pop. But for stays at non-Disney properties such as the Fairfield Inn & Suites in Kissimmee, you can indulge in as many Mickey-shaped waffles as you want as part of its complimentary breakfast buffet.“I’ve eaten at hotel breakfasts around the world, but the breakfasts in Orlando hotels are the busiest I’ve ever seen,” says Button, who runs the Wanderful World of Travel blog. “When you can get a Mickey-shaped waffle for free, wouldn’t you?”SAVING MONEY, TIME AND ENERGYComplimentary breakfast is the most frequently used search filter on Hilton’s website, according to the Hilton 2023 Trends Report.Free breakfast can be a money-saver, especially for families or larger groups.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797335,Sudan teen refugee freed after 5 months in Libyan detention,"CAIRO (AP) — A Sudanese teen refugee has been released from a detention center in western Libya where he was held for five months after being kidnapped and tortured by gunmen demanding ransom, his family said Wednesday.

            Mazen Adam, 15, from Sudan’s conflict-torn Darfur region, walked free on Monday from a juvenile detention center near the capital, Tripoli, according to his father, Mohamed Adam. 

            However, Libyan authorities have not dropped charges against the boy, claiming the kidnapping was fabricated, and only released him pending investigation, his father said.











            “Mazen is well but he still suffers from torture-related injuries,” the father told The Associated Press. 

            The second of four siblings, Mazen will be checked by doctors from the U.N. refugee agency on Feb, 12 in the Libyan capital, the father also said. The family is registered with the UNHCR as Sudanese refugees in Libya. 

            Mazen's father and Libyan rights groups deny claims that the kidnapping was fabricated. A government spokesman did not answer calls seeking comment.

            Mazen was kidnapped on Aug. 30 by unknown gunmen, demanding ransom in the western town of Warshafana, on the southwestern outskirts of Tripoli. 

            Shortly after his abduction, he appeared in a video on social media, begging for mercy as a man beat him and pointed a riffle at his face, apparently to scare him. 

            A day later, his father was taken by armed men in uniform after he spoke publicly about his son's kidnapping. The father was released three weeks later and launched a campaign for his son’s freedom. 

            It's unclear how Mazen went from being in the hands of his kidnappers to being held in juvenile detention. His father blames the local police.

            “Police in Warshafana conspired with the kidnappers who tortured my son,” he said, adding that the kidnappers have vanished and that the police did not pursue them.

            Local rights groups joined Adam's efforts to free Mazen and called for authorities to take action. 

            The National Commission for Human Rights in Libya, a rights group, said Mazen was a victim of human traffickers, and appealed on Libyan prosecutors to annul accusations against him.

            Mazen's story and the video of his ordeal at the hands of his captors has underscored how abuse, torture, sexual violence, and killings of migrants are rampant in Libya.

            The oil-rich North African country plunged into chaos following a NATO-backed uprising that toppled and killed longtime autocrat Moammar Gadhafi in 2011.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797336,Convicted Khmer Rouge leader moved to Cambodian state prison,"PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) — Khieu Samphan, who was convicted by a U.N.-backed tribunal of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes for his role as a leader of the communist Khmer Rouge when they ruled Cambodia in 1975-1979, has been transferred from the tribunal’s jail to serve his life sentence at a state prison.

            The tribunal, called the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia, said in a statement Wednesday that Khieu Samphan was moved on Monday from its custom-built detention facility to serve the remainder of his sentence in the provincial prison in Kandal, which adjoins the capital, Phnom Penh.

            Khieu Samphan, 91, is the last surviving top leader of the Khmer Rouge, whose radical policies are blamed for the deaths of an estimated 1.7 million people when they held power.











            His transfer came as the tribunal winds down its activities after its last court session in September, when it rejected Khieu Samphan’s final appeal. The tribunal, whose work was carried out by joint teams of Cambodian and international jurists, spent $337 million and 16 years to obtain three convictions.

            Since Dec. 26, it has handed over its complex of buildings, including the detention facility, to Cambodia’s Defense Ministry, the original owners of the site, said tribunal spokesperson Neth Pheaktra. The tribunal will continue working for three years after the trials’ end on archiving documents and public education, with its remaining staff moved to a new building in the center of the capital.

            Khieu Samphan was the Khmer Rouge’s nominal head of state, but at his trial he denied having real decision-making power when the group carried out a reign of terror to try to establish a utopian agrarian society, but instead caused widespread deaths from execution, starvation and inadequate medical care. The Khmer Rouge were ousted from power in 1979 by an invasion by neighboring Communist Vietnam.

            Khieu Samphan was convicted in 2018 and sentenced to life in prison. He was already serving another life sentence following his 2014 conviction for crimes against humanity connected with forced transfers and disappearances of masses of people.

            The Khmer Rouge’s real chief, Pol Pot, escaped justice. He died in a jungle in 1998 at age 72 while the remnants of his movement were fighting their last battles in the guerrilla war they launched after losing power.

            Be Tealeng, deputy director-general of the Interior Ministry's Prison Department, confirmed that Khieu Samphan is now detained at Kandal provincial prison and is being held in a cell separate from other prisoners for the sake of his security and health.

            Khieu Ratana, Khieu Samphan’s daughter, said her father, who was visited by his family on Tuesday, was in good health and had no complaints about his transfer.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797338,Edmunds: Why you need winter tires,"It’s obvious that when temperatures drop and winter weather arrives you’ll need to put away your shorts and T-shirt and go for pants and a thick coat. But the decision to swap out your vehicle’s all-season tires for winter tires isn’t so clear-cut. Some drivers put too much faith in a single tire type to handle every temperature and surface condition, while others want to avoid the time and added expense of switching to a dedicated winter tire. 

            What is for certain is that a good winter tire will always outperform an all-season tire in snowy, icy conditions and be the safer alternative. Edmunds’ experts explain the importance of winter tires and offer advice on when to use them and how much you should pay.

            ALL-SEASON VERSUS WINTER TIRES











            All-season tires, which come standard on most vehicles, are designed to function in a wide range of temperatures on a variety of surfaces. Think of the phrase “jack of all trades, master of none” and you’ve got the idea for all-season tires. Winter tires, in contrast, are designed to offer optimal performance in cold, icy and snowy conditions. 

            According to the Traffic Injury Research Foundation, winter tires provide improved traction, braking, and handling in all cold-weather driving conditions compared to all-season tires. With 30% shorter stopping distances and less chance of sliding, winter tires reduce accident and injury potential compared to all-season rubber.

            Winter tires are made from a softer rubber compound that stays more flexible as temperatures drop. This results in more grip because they conform to the road better than summer or all-season tires. Additionally, winter tires use deep open-tread patterns designed to push away slush and small grooves called biting edges or sipes to dig into slick surfaces.

            WHEN TO SWITCH TIRES

            If you live somewhere with mild winters, meaning little to no snowfall, your all-season tires should be suitable year-round. However, if winter historically brings heavy snow and freezing temperatures, you should plan to change tires with the first forecasted snow. Making the switch early enough means you won’t be caught off-guard if a storm arrives suddenly and road conditions deteriorate. 

            To avoid the hassle of getting the winter tires mounted and balanced every year, experts recommend buying an affordable set of wheels — nothing too fancy, since they’ll be getting snow, salt, mud and ice on them — with the same diameter and bolt pattern as your current wheels. Next, have the winter tires mounted on the alternate wheels and then swap wheels once the warmer season arrives.

            At the other end of the equation, leaving winter tires on too long, or even year-round, will lead them to wear out quickly as temperatures rise. The same soft compounds that remain grippy and flexible in cold weather eat away rapidly on hot roads. Keep in mind that winter tires will need to be stored when not in use, so set aside an area in your attic, garage or shed to stack them.

            Tire Rack, a well-known tire retailer, recommends inflating winter tires 3-5 pounds per square inch above the recommended pressures for your vehicle. This is partly to offset the fact that each 10-degree Fahrenheit drop in outside temperature can equate to a 1- to 2-pound loss in air pressure inside the tire.

            HOW MUCH DO WINTER TIRES COST?

            If you have yet to invest in a set of winter tires, the upfront cost may have been a factor. Fortunately, a set of winter tires is, on average, no more expensive than a set of all-seasons. Prices will vary based on brand and tire size. Furthermore, you will pause the wear — and thereby extend the life — of your all-season tires when using winter tires, and vice versa. 

            Winter tires from reputable brands are often more expensive than others, but their performance and durability are largely worth the premium. According to tire experts, a set of winter rubber should last roughly five seasons or more, especially if they’re rotated every 5,000 miles to wear evenly.

            EDMUNDS SAYS: 

            It may be easier to keep the same set of tires on your vehicle year-round, but the added safety and confidence that come from using winter tires in colder climates is well worth the effort and expense.

            The Cleveland-based institution announced Wednesday the 14 artists and groups being considered for Rock Hall induction, also including Rage Against the Machine, The Spinners, A Tribe Called Quest, The White Stripes, Warren Zevon and Joy Division/New Order.

            If Elliott makes it, she would become the first female hip-hop artist in the hall. 











            “This is an incredible honor. I’m so humbled and grateful to be counted amongst all the incredible honorees. I’ve spent my career making the kind of music I love and it means so much to know that I have touched others as well,"" she said in a statement.

            Artists must have released their first commercial recording at least 25 years before they're eligible for induction. 

            “This remarkable list of nominees reflects the diverse artists and music that the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame honors and celebrates,” said John Sykes, chair of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Foundation in a statement. “These artists have created their own sounds that have impacted generations and influenced countless others that have followed in their footsteps.”

            Eight out of 14 nominees are on the ballot for the first time, including Crow, Elliott, Joy Division/New Order, Lauper, Michael, Nelson, The White Stripes and Zevon. This is the first year of eligibility for Elliott and The White Stripes. While the late Zevon has been eligible since 1994, Billy Joel led a push for his entry, writing to the nominating committee urging them to consider Zevon.

            ""Seeing my name on this year’s ballot with so many talents that I admire means so much to me. It has been a lifetime privilege to reach so many different kinds of fans with a message of following your own path (and having fun along the way, too),” Lauper wrote in a statement.

            A Tribe Called Quest and Bush were nominees last year and didn't make the cut but now find themselves back in the running this year. Bush's latest nod may be due to a new wave in popularity after the show “Stranger Things” featured her song ""Running Up That Hill (A Deal with God)."" 

            Inductees will be announced in May and the ceremony will take place this fall. Nominees will be voted on by more than 1,000 artists, historians and music industry professionals. Fans can vote online or in person at the museum, with the top five artists picked by the public making up a “fans' ballot” that will be tallied with the other professional ballots.

            Last year, the nomination process was complicated by Dolly Parton, who gave the honor an enthusiastic embrace after temporarily turning it down. She initially said she did not want to take votes away from the remaining nominees and had not “earned that right.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797347,Q&A: Big Brothers Big Sisters CEO recruits alumni as mentors,"NEW YORK (AP) — Big Brothers Big Sisters America CEO Artis Stevens says the 119-year-old nonprofit long known for mentoring schoolchildren is now diversifying its programming.

            Stevens, who took over the organization two years ago, said the fastest growing demand for its services is among young adults, ages 18-25, and he wants to expand its offerings to meet the changing availability of mentors and needs and interests of mentees.

            “A lot of kids we have been serving are raising their hand and saying, 'What’s next? How do I navigate?',” he told The Associated Press. 











            Big Brothers Big Sisters is now offering group mentoring — gathering together multiple adults, known as Bigs, with multiple young people, called Littles — as well as a greater focus on career development and mental health.

            
                Data released last week from the U.S. Census Bureau and AmeriCorps found that the number of Americans volunteering through a formal program dropped 7% from 2019 to 2021, which corresponds with the profound social disruptions the pandemic caused. 

            “When we’re in a moment when kids are experiencing senses of isolation and struggling socially,"" said Nancy Deutsch, a professor of education at the University of Virginia. “Mentoring is the kind of intervention that I think is really important.”

            Stevens said he hopes to address the chronic shortage of Bigs for interested Littles by recruiting mentors from the organization’s 20 million alumni.

            This interview has been condensed and edited. 

            ___

            Q: What should people know about the children you serve? 

            A: We were born as an alternative innovation to the juvenile justice system. So our mandate was always focused around young people at the time who were immigrants, who were in street gangs, who were homeless, who had the greatest challenges. The idea was: Instead of putting kids into the juvenile justice system, can we connect them with positive people in their community? 

            We know the resilience that these kids have, but we also know the power when they’re matched with a positive relationship with an adult, what that can do to help them thrive, what it can do to help them grow. 

            ____

            Q: Who can be mentors? Do you have to have it all figured out?

            One of our most common expressions is, “You don’t have to be perfect, you just have to be present.” So if you look at our mentors, they come from all walks of life. They’re all backgrounds, all ages, all demographics. But the commonality they all have is they believe in showing up for kids.

            ____

            Q: How are you recruiting volunteers, especially after a drop in formal volunteering during the pandemic? 

            A: It’s incredibly, incredibly challenging for most organizations right now. So we have implemented a technology platform that’s allowing us to do what we call “technology enabled mentoring” much more effectively.

            Our biggest challenge in attracting volunteers is accessibility. Finding ways that they can plug in, ways that we can create proximity to the communities that they live in and making sure there is a value in the impact in the young person's life and for the person who gets involved. 

            _____

            Q: You came to lead Big Brothers Big Sisters America during the pandemic and after the killings of George Floyd and others by police. Would you speak about how you’re coming to this job as a Black man? 

            A: I take great responsibility. I take great pride. When I became the CEO, of course, I was the first Black CEO in our 119-year history, and that means a lot to me. It’s significant certainly in the recognition of it. But it’s more significant in the representation it means for other kids, other communities to say, “If he can do it, I can do it or I can exceed it.”

            The first thing that I did was created a national Justice, Equity, Diversity and Inclusion (JEDI) advisory council. This group was essential for helping us to get outside of our inside thinking. We’ve been around for over a century and we had issues that we needed to look at, just like the country does. 

            Then, so much happens at the board level of local and national nonprofit organizations. A staff person can believe certain things, but if your board isn't commitment, it’s hard to truly implement those things. So we’re doing a lot of board training and coaching.

            The last thing I’ll say is, we are not a political organization. We don’t want to be a political organization. What we believe is in youth empowerment, and we believe that every single young person should have access to opportunity. 

            _____

            Q: MacKenzie Scott gave your organization more than $122 million. Has that donation cooled interest from other donors? 

            A: It hasn’t. You know, $122 million, that’s a lot of money, right? It allowed us to talk about an investment as an invitation for more people to come and join and be part of this community. We decided to create a fund that our local organizations who received funding can contribute to that would help the other 200 organizations that didn't receive funding. We call it the Bigger Together Fund. For us, if we’re going to take this investment, it had to be invested in every community, not just the 38 that were funded.

            ____

            Q: What's next for Big Brothers Big Sisters America? 

            A: We are really focused on our 20 million alumni and champions who have been part of our program. Our goal is to bring those alumni back into the fold, to bring them in to volunteer more effectively, to help us to fundraise, to help us to spread the word is going to be core to what we do. We hope that more people would hopefully join us, raise their hand and come back and support and be a mentor.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797348,Teen gets 10 years for house fire that killed 5 from Senegal,"DENVER (AP) — A Colorado teenager who was one of three friends who authorities say ignited a house fire that killed five Senegalese immigrants was sentenced Wednesday to 10 years behind bars in court where a man who lost his wife and baby daughter called the boy a “monster.”

            Amadou Beye said he thinks about killing himself every day and needs medication to sleep. His wife, Hassan Diol, had immigrated to the United States before him and he hadn't yet met their infant daughter, Hawa.

            “My life doesn’t make sense anymore,” Beye told Judge Martin Egelhoff during a sentencing hearing for Dillon Siebert, who was 14 at the time of the Aug. 5, 2020 fire and is now 17. At the hearing, Beye wore a sweatshirt with a photo of his wife and baby together, with the words “Why my wife? Why my daughter?”











            The investigation of the fire dragged on for months without any leads amid fears that the fire had been a hate crime, prompting many Senegalese immigrants to install security cameras at their homes in case they could also be targeted. But authorities ended up alleging a separate, disturbing motive — three teens had set fire to the house out of revenge for a stolen iPhone, which one of them mistakenly traced to the home in a neighborhood near Denver’s airport.

            Siebert, originally charged as a juvenile, pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in adult court in December under a deal that prosecutors and the defense said balanced his lesser role in planning the fire, his remorse and interest in rehabilitation with the horror of the crime. 

            In juvenile court on Wednesday, Siebert was sentenced to serve three years in juvenile detention under the terms of the deal. In a separate hearing in adult court, where Beye, and other relatives and members of the Senegalese community spoke against the agreement, Siebert was sentenced to serve seven years in a state prison program for young inmates. If he violates the terms of that sentence, he would then be required to serve 26 years in prison, prosecutors said. 

            The cases against the other two teens, including the alleged ringleader, Kevin Bui, and Gavin Seymour, who were 16 at the time of the fire, are still pending in adult court where they are charged with first-degree murder, attempted murder, arson and burglary. 

            Also killed in the fire were Hassan Diol's brother, Djibril, his wife, Adja Diol and their 22-month-old daughter Khadija. Their bodies were found on the first floor of the home near the front door. Their deaths prompted expressions of sympathy from Senegal’s president, Macky Sall.

            Others speaking at the sentencing hearing talked about the huge hole left by the loss of Djibril Diol, an engineer who was working on a large rebuilding of Interstate 70 in the city, and dreamed about returning to Senegal to build roads there. He helped fellow immigrants and was a devout Muslim, waking early for morning prayers, they said. 

            Djibril Diol's brother, Abou Diol, said he lost the person he trusted to give him good advice and said their father has “lost his mind” since the fire. 

            Friend and community leader Ousman Ba said 10 years was not justice for such a crime and wondered what would have happened if five members of a white family were killed in such a way.

            “But Black lives don't matter,” he said. 

            Siebert looked toward family members and friends as they addressed Egelhoff but did not seem to display any emotion. When given a chance to make a statement, he did express remorse.

            “I am here to apologize for what I have done to you and your family,” said Siebert, who also spoke of how upset he had been when losing a single, valued family member, his grandmother, shortly before the fire after not being able to see her because of pandemic restrictions. 

            His defense attorney, Johnna Stuart, described Siebert as an “extreme follower” who was bullied over a speech delay, and fell in with Bui and Seymour amid the isolation of the pandemic.

            Bui — who was identified as a suspect with the others after police got a search warrant asking Google for which accounts had searched the home's address within 15 days of the fire — allegedly told investigators he had been robbed the month before the fire while trying to buy a gun, and traced his iPhone to the home using an app. He admitted to setting the fire, only to find out the next day through news coverage that the victims were not the people who robbed him, according to police.

            Lawyers for Bui and Seymour are challenging police's use of the Google keyword search results, calling it a “digital dragnet” that swept up searches of billions of people around the world. 

            Egelhoff denied an attempt last year to have the Google search evidence thrown out, but defense lawyers have now asked the Colorado Supreme Court to consider the issue. It is scheduled to hear arguments on it in May.DENVER (AP) — A Colorado teenager who was one of three friends who authorities say ignited a house fire that killed five Senegalese immigrants was sentenced Wednesday to 10 years behind bars in court where a man who lost his wife and baby daughter called the boy a “monster.”Amadou Beye said he thinks about killing himself every day and needs medication to sleep.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797349,Bulgaria and Serbia diversify energy supplies,"SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) — The presidents of Bulgaria and Serbia on Wednesday launched the construction of the Bulgarian part of a gas link that is designed to diversify the energy supplies of a region that until recently was almost fully dependent on natural gas deliveries from Russia.

            The 85.5 million-euro ($93.2 million) project is one of several planned gas interconnectors that would give eastern European Union members and countries hoping to join the 27-nation bloc access to the global gas market.

            The 170-kilometer (106-mile) conduit, which the EU is mostly funding, will run from the Bulgarian city of Novi Iskar to Nis in southern Serbia. Plans call for an initial capacity of 1.8 billion cubic meters of gas a year with the possibility of reverse flow. 











            The pipeline extension is intended to bring gas from Azerbaijan through a new pipeline system that ends in Italy and to give Serbia access to ports in Greece that are importing liquefied natural gas, or LNG.

            “The interconnector is an example of the successful implementation of the European strategy for affordable energy,” Bulgarian President Rumen Radev said after the symbolic start of the construction.

            Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic thanked the European Union for helping to finance the project, which faced multiple holdups and is set to be completed in October.

Plans call for an initial capacity of 1.8 billion cubic meters of gas a year with the possibility of reverse flow.The pipeline extension is intended to bring gas from Azerbaijan through a new pipeline system that ends in Italy and to give Serbia access to ports in Greece that are importing liquefied natural gas, or LNG.“The interconnector is an example of the successful implementation of the European strategy for affordable energy,” Bulgarian President Rumen Radev said after the symbolic start of the construction.Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic thanked the European Union for helping to finance the project, which faced multiple holdups and is set to be completed in October.“It is important not only for diversification, but also for securing the energy future of our countries and of the entire region,” Vucic saidBulgaria is a member of the EU, and Serbia is a candidate for membership.",2023/02/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797350,Women's World Cup hosts urge FIFA not to sign Saudi sponsor,"GENEVA (AP) — Women’s World Cup co-hosts Australia and New Zealand urged FIFA on Wednesday not to sign a sponsor deal with the tourism authority of Saudi Arabia where “rights of women remain severely restricted.”

            Leaders of the two national soccer federations warned in a letter to FIFA, including president Gianni Infantino, that unilaterally sealing the “Visit Saudi” sponsorship could “severely tarnish the reputation” of the 32-nation tournament that starts in July.

            That is despite the tourism brand being endorsed by men's World Cup-winning captain Lionel Messi, who was announced last year as a paid pitchman.











            Such a confrontation between a World Cup host and FIFA is unprecedented in recent history, and is likely to shine more attention on so-called “sportswashing” investments by Saudi Arabia. 

            “We write to express our serious disappointment and concern at the news of the apparent appointment of Visit Saudi as a sponsor,” Chris Nikou of Australia and New Zealand’s Joanna Wood wrote Wednesday in the letter to FIFA seen by The Associated Press.

            “We cannot express strongly enough the potential repercussions and fallout that could result of this decision.

            “Australia and New Zealand, both as sovereign nations and as football associations, have for decades placed the utmost importance on gender equality, and have sought to promote these ideals around the world,” the letter said, reminding FIFA their governments have invested hundreds of millions in the soccer event.

            Tournament organizers and government officials in both countries were said not to have been consulted, they claimed, nor offered the chance to make a counter proposal for a domestic tourism campaign.

            Wood is among the few women to lead one of FIFA’s 211 member federations and also an elected member of FIFA’s ruling council which Infantino chairs.

            FIFA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

            Saudi Arabia has made progress in women’s soccer in the past three years creating a national team and a domestic league, plus preparing a bid to host the 2026 Women’s Asian Cup.

            In Saudi society, however, women’s freedoms are limited by strict male guardianship laws.

            “While we acknowledge some important and positive gender equality reforms have commenced in Saudi Arabia, it remains undeniable under any reasonable standard that the rights of women remain severely restricted,” the Women’s World Cup hosts wrote to FIFA.

            Tony Gustavsson, head coach of Australia's women's national team, didn't directly comment on the issue of the sponsorship Thursday while unveiling a squad for the Feb. 16-22 Cup of Nations tournament, but said “I know what these women stand for and what the team stands for.""

            “I’ve had the privilege to meet the Matildas alumni and everyone knows the core values of this team,"" he said. Football Australia “is seeking more information and the team knows what they stand for.”

            The “Visit Saudi” campaign was among more than 30 sponsors at the men’s World Cup in Qatar last year.

            FIFA did not formally announce that deal which became apparent through pitchside advertisements when the games started in November.

            The Women’s World Cup is to be played July 20-Aug. 20. The United States is defending its title in the first edition of the marquee tournament expanded to 32 teams.

            It will also be the first test of FIFA's policy to separate broadcasting and sponsor deals for the Women's World Cup from the men's event. That was intended to give independence to women's soccer and prove it had its own commercial value.

            Infantino previously defended the women's tournament when he used the platform of the finals tournament draw in Auckland in October to criticize broadcasters for making offers for rights that FIFA deemed unacceptably low.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797351,"Dani Alves offers to turn in passport, wear tracking device","MADRID (AP) — Brazilian soccer player Dani Alves has agreed to turn in his passport and wear a tracking device if he is set free pending the sexual assault investigation against him, his lawyers said in an appeal filed to a Spanish court this week.

            Alves was provisionally detained in January after being accused of sexually assaulting a woman at a nightclub on Dec. 30. A judge ordered the veteran player to be jailed without bail after analyzing the initial probe by authorities and hearing testimony from Alves, the alleged victim and a witness.

            Alves has denied any wrongdoing.











            In the appeal obtained by The Associated Press on Wednesday, Alves offered to report to the court and to authorities as often as required, including daily, and to not leave Spain. He would not get within 500 meters (yards) of the accuser or her home or work place, and would not communicate with her in any matter. The appeal said he would agree to wear a device allowing authorities to constantly monitor his whereabouts to make sure he complied with his obligations.

            The appeal said Alves would pay bail in the amount established by the judge, in addition to giving up his travel documents to authorities. The judge had denied Alves bail in part because he was deemed a flight risk.

            Alves' lawyers, which includes the same one who worked for Lionel Messi in his tax fraud case, claimed that the accusations alone made by the alleged victim were not enough to prompt his detention without bail.

            They said there were inconsistencies in her testimony, including when she said she was scared of Alves and his friends at the nightclub even though security cameras showed that she and her friends were in a “festive” way.

            They also point to images that showed that the accuser was not forced into the bathroom where she claimed to have been assaulted.

            Alves initially denied having sex with her but later admitted to a consensual sexual encounter.

            The lawyers said in the appeal that he initially denied that he had sex with her because he wanted to protect his wife and children.

            The accuser has reportedly relinquished her right to seek financial compensation from Alves if he is eventually found guilty.

            Under Spain’s sexual consent law passed last year, sexual assault takes in a wide array of crimes from online abuse and groping to rape, each with different possible punishments. A case of violent rape can receive a maximum sentence of 15 years.

            The 39-year-old Alves won 42 soccer titles, including three Champions Leagues with Barcelona and two Copa Americas with Brazil. He played in his third World Cup last year in Qatar.

            Alves had his contract with Mexican club Pumas terminated after his arrest. He was detained after returning from Brazil to Spain and agreeing to talk to authorities about the case. His lawyers said Alves has also lost sponsorships because of his arrest.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797399,Dutch government reports 1 case of mad cow disease on farm,"THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — A cow that died recently on a Dutch farm tested positive for mad cow disease, the government of the Netherlands announced Wednesday, in a rare case of the cattle illness that can cause a fatal brain disease in people who eat tainted beef.

            The farm where the cow died has been sealed off, Agriculture Minister Piet Adema said in a letter to lawmakers. He added that the infected animal “did not get into the food chain and does not constitute a risk to food safety.”

            Formally called bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE, the disease first broke out in the late 1980s among cattle in Britain. Hundreds of people fell ill with the human equivalent, a brain disorder called variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and many died. Over the years, 4.5 million cattle were slaughtered to contain the spread.











            The number of BSE cases plummeted after bans were introduced on feed that included meat and bone meal from infected cows believed to cause the disease.

            Tests on the 8-year-old cow from a farm in South Holland province established that the dead animal had a naturally occurring form of the disease called atypical BSE, the government said later Wednesday, and not so-called classical BSE, which is caused by animals eating contaminated feed.

They will be euthanized, tested for BSE and destroyed, the ministry said.THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — A cow that died recently on a Dutch farm tested positive for mad cow disease, the government of the Netherlands announced Wednesday, in a rare case of the cattle illness that can cause a fatal brain disease in people who eat tainted beef.The farm where the cow died has been sealed off, Agriculture Minister Piet Adema said in a letter to lawmakers. He added that the infected animal “did not get into the food chain and does not constitute a risk to food safety.”Formally called bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE, the disease first broke out in the late 1980s among cattle in Britain. Hundreds of people fell ill with the human equivalent, a brain disorder called variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and many died. Over the years, 4.5 million cattle were slaughtered to contain the spread.The number of BSE cases plummeted after bans were introduced on feed that included meat and bone meal from infected cows believed to cause the disease.The last case detected in the Netherlands was in 2011.Tests on the 8-year-old cow from a farm in South Holland province established that the dead animal had a naturally occurring form of the disease called atypical BSE, the government said later Wednesday, and not so-called classical BSE, which is caused by animals eating contaminated feed.Food safety authorities are conducting an investigation to trace any offspring of the dead animal as well as cows that ate the same feed or grew up with it.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797400,"Tom Brady retires at 45, insisting this time it's 'for good'","TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — This time, Tom Brady says he's done for good.

            The seven-time Super Bowl winner with New England and Tampa Bay announced his retirement from the NFL on Wednesday, exactly one year after first saying his playing days were over, by posting a brief video lasting just under one minute on social media.

            Unlike last winter, though, the most successful quarterback in league history, as well as one of the greatest athletes in team sports, said his decision was final.











            “Good morning guys. I'll get to the point right away,"" Brady says as the message begins. “I'm retiring. For good.""

            He briefly retired after the 2021 season but wound up coming back for one more year with the Buccaneers. He retires at age 45, the owner of virtually every meaningful NFL passing record in an unprecedented 23-year career.

            A year ago when he retired, it was in the form of a long Instagram post. But about six weeks later, he decided to return for one more run, citing “unfinished business” after an early playoff exit.

            The Buccaneers — with whom he won a Super Bowl two seasons ago — made the playoffs again this season, losing in their playoff opener. And at the time, it begged the question about whether Brady would play again.

            Only a couple of weeks later, he has given the answer.

            “I know the process was a pretty big deal last time, so when I woke up this morning, I figured I’d just press record and let you guys know first,"" Brady says in the video. “I won’t be long-winded. You only get one super emotional retirement essay and I used mine up last year.

            “I really thank you guys so much, to every single one of you for supporting me. My family, my friends, teammates, my competitors. I could go on forever. There’s too many. Thank you guys for allowing me to live my absolute dream. I wouldn’t change a thing. Love you all.""

            Brady is the NFL’s career leader in yards passing (89,214) and touchdowns (649). He is the only player to win more than five Super Bowls and has been MVP of the game five times. He also holds marks for regular-season wins (251), Super Bowl appearances (10), playoff games and wins (48, 35), as well as playoff yards (13,400) and TDs (88).

            “Tom’s legacy is unmatched in the history of this game. All the Super Bowl titles and statistical records speak for themselves, but the impact he had on so many people through the years is what I appreciate the most,” Buccaneers general manager Jason Licht said.

            “His imprint on this organization helped take us to the mountaintop. We will certainly miss him as our quarterback, but I will also miss him as a leader and friend,” Licht added. ""Our entire organization is indebted to him for what he provided us over the past three years. We won’t ever forget the wins or the accolades, and his influence will be felt for years to come.”

            Brady announced his retirement one day after attending the premiere of “80 for Brady"" — which comes out Friday — in Los Angeles. The movie tells the story of four lifelong friends, played by Lily Tomlin, Jane Fonda, Rita Moreno and Sally Field, who went to a Super Bowl to see Brady play.

            He was asked Tuesday night whether he felt a connection working with women — the four stars range in age from 76 to 91 — who don’t want to retire.

            “They’re working hard and they love it. So good for them,"" Brady told The Associated Press. “You know, it’s just that’s what life is about. You got to, you know, wake up every day with a purpose. And when you find something you love to do, you know, it’s hard to stop. You really enjoy it. And there’s a lot of aspects that you do enjoy. So they still bring it at this age. It’s really unbelievable to watch them on set and how much energy they have. And I certainly was inspired by them and learned a lot of lessons on this whole experience.”

            Famously underrated coming into the NFL — he was picked 199th in the 2000 draft by the Patriots, behind six other quarterbacks, three kickers and a punter — Brady certainly wasn’t expected to become synonymous with greatness. He played in one game as a rookie, completing one of three passes for six yards.

            The next year, it all changed.

            Brady took over as the Patriots’ starter, the team beat the St. Louis Rams in the Super Bowl that capped the 2001 season and he and New England coach Bill Belichick were well on their way to becoming the most successful coach-QB duo in football history.

            More Super Bowl wins came after the 2003 and 2004 seasons. The Patriots returned to football’s mountaintop for a fourth time in Brady’s era a decade later to cap the 2014 season, the start of three more titles in a span of five years.

            He signed with Tampa Bay in free agency in 2020 and added a seventh Super Bowl ring to his collection in his first season with his new team. The Bucs and won 37 games (including postseason) with Brady at quarterback — third most in the league over the past three seasons behind Kansas City (46) and Buffalo (41).

            “I think I’ve been on the record dozens of times saying there’s no quarterback I’d rather have than Tom Brady, and I still feel that way,"" Belichick said in 2021 — shortly before Tampa Bay, with Brady, came to New England and beat the Patriots in a game dubbed “The Return."" “I was very lucky to have Tom as the quarterback, to coach him, and he was as good as any coach could ever ask for.""

            Brady set league single-season records for completions (490) and pass attempts (733) while throwing for 4,643 yards, 25 touchdowns and nine interceptions in his final season. The Bucs, however ranked dead last in rushing offense and, forced to rely almost solely of Brady’s arm, struggled to get the ball into the end zone.

            After scoring 61 touchdowns in 2021, Tampa Bay slipped to 31 last season and averaged just 18.4 points per game — down from over 30 in Brady’s first two seasons with the Bucs.

            At 8-9, Brady’s only losing season in over two decades as a NFL starter, the Bucs became just the fourth team in league history to earn a postseason berth with a losing mark in a non-strike year. The offensive struggles continued during a lopsided loss to Dallas in the NFC wild-card round.

            Brady won three NFL MVP awards, was a first-team All-Pro three times and was selected to the Pro Bowl 15 times.

            Brady and model Gisele Bündchen finalized their divorce this past fall, during the Bucs' season. It ended a 13-year marriage between two superstars who respectively reached the pinnacles of football and fashion.

            It was announced last year that when Brady retires from playing, he would join Fox Sports as a television analyst in a 10-year, $375 million deal.

            Audible announced Wednesday that the former first lady will launch the “Michelle Obama: The Light Podcast” on March 7. It’s based on Obama’s tour promoting “The Light We Carry,” her recent bestselling book, which featured special guests like Oprah Winfrey, Ellen DeGeneres, Tyler Perry, David Letterman and more.

            “Though only a few thousand people were able to attend the events live, these remarkable conversations can now be heard by everyone,” Audible said in a news release.

            Obama said in a statement that the book tour was a way to expand on the book’s reflections about dealing with stress and change and a chance to “connect with real people once again.” The podcast, she said, is “a deeper examination of those fun and meaningful moments.”

            State troopers were called to the Alburgh Community Education Center just before 7 p.m. Tuesday after a report of a large fight involving spectators during a seventh- and eighth-grade boys basketball game between Alburgh and St. Albans.

            The fight ended before troopers arrived, and many of the participants had left. Russell Giroux, of Alburgh, sought medical attention, police said. He was taken by ambulance to the Northwestern Medical Center in St. Albans, where he was pronounced dead.

            Gill scored 126 not out off 63 balls, including 12 fours and seven sixes, as India put up 234-4 (20 overs). In reply, New Zealand collapsed to 66 all out in 12.1 overs, its third-lowest T20 total.

            Gill topped Virat Kohli’s 122 not out against Afghanistan last year.











            “I am happy that my hard work in practice is paying off,"" the player-of-the-match said. “I was backing myself to score big. It didn’t work against Sri Lanka, but I am glad it worked out now. It was my dream to play for India and I am very fortunate to be part of the team in all three formats.”

            Batting first, India lost Ishan Kishan (1) to spin but Rahul Tripathi smacked 44 off 22 balls, including four fours and three sixes, to set the tempo for India in its biggest T20 win (by runs).

            Tripathi and Gill added 80 off 42 balls for the second wicket, as the latter reached 50 off 35 balls.

            Gill added another 38 runs with Suryakumar Yadav (24) before reaching his maiden T20 hundred off 54 balls.

            He became the fifth Indian batsman to score a hundred in all three formats, after Suresh Raina, Rohit Sharma, Lokesh Rahul and Virat Kohli.

            Gill accelerated in the second part of his innings, scoring the second 50 off only 19 balls, including three fours and five sixes.

            The hosts garnered 103 runs in the final seven overs thanks to Gill’s onslaught.

            In doing so, he added 103 runs off only 40 balls with Hardik Pandya (30) for the fourth wicket as India notched its fifth-highest T20 total.

            Chasing an improbable 235, New Zealand crashed to the biggest defeat (by runs) between two full member T20 nations.

            India’s pacers were on the money from the word go, using the dew to full effect.

            Pandya struck twice in two overs to remove Finn Allen (3) and Glenn Phillips (2). Suryakumar Yadav took identical leaping catches at slip to help dismiss both.

            At the other end, Arshdeep Singh dismissed Devon Conway (1) and Mark Chapman (0).

            New Zealand was down to 7-4 in 2.4 overs, and then 21-5 in 4.3 overs. Umran Malik bowled Michael Bracewell (8) to end the Black Caps’ ceremonial challenge.

            Pandya finished with 4-16 from four overs. Singh (2-16), Malik (2-9) and Shivam Mavi (2-12) took a couple wickets each as only one over of spin was used.

            Daryl Mitchell top-scored with 35 off 25 balls for the visitors, with Mitchell Santner (13) the only other batsman to reach double figures.

            India had swept the three-match ODI series. Its next assignment is the four-test Border-Gavaskar Trophy against Australia beginning Feb. 9.

And while there are dozens of tomato-based choices, you can also find more exotic offerings, many of them fruit-forward. And those can become inspiration for our homemade versions.

            Popular salsa variations include peach, mango, pineapple, black bean and corn, avocado, and green tomatillo.

            What game day foods does salsa go with? What DOESN’T salsa go with? Clearly, it works well with chips (potato, tortilla, pita and so on). Definitely nachos, tacos, burritos, quesadillas. Ditto an assortment of raw veggies, from carrots to cucumber slices to planks of jicama. A scoop of salsa on a bowl of chili is a terrific contrasting topper. Chicken wings benefit from a dunk in a bright spicy salsa. And a spoonful is excellent atop a burger or slider.

            So, let’s wow our friends and make our own. Here are three quick and easy fruit salsas that will elevate game day and still fit right in.

            PINEAPPLE-MINT-JALAPENO SALSA

            This so, so pretty and colorful salsa is truly refreshing, even with the kick from the jalapenos (and of course the amount of jalapeño can be adjusted as desired). The sweetness of the pineapple is a bright surprising base. If you use two different-colored bell peppers, the salsa gets that much more colorful, but if you use just one pepper of any color that’s absolutely fine, too. Try this with teriyaki beef skewers or pulled pork sandwiches.

            In a medium bowl, combine 2 cups ¼-inch diced pineapple, ½ cup diced bell pepper (any color or mix of colors), 1 to 2 tablespoons chopped mint, 1 teaspoon minced jalapeno (or more to taste), 1 tablespoon lime juice and salt to taste.

            TROPICAL FRUIT SALSA

            Besides the usual game-day menu suspects, this is great with fish (think fish tacos) and on top of grilled chicken.

            In a medium bowl, combine 1/2 cup finely diced pineapple, ½ cup finely diced mango, ½ cup finely diced papaya (or additional mango), ½ cup finely diced red bell pepper, ½ cup finely diced onion, 1 kiwi peeled and finely diced, 1 teaspoon minced jalapeno, 2 teaspoons minced cilantro, the juice of 1 lime, ¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes or to taste, pinch cayenne pepper, and salt to taste.

            SPICY PEAR SALSA

            Also remember this next time you make a roasted pork loin or cook a turkey breast. The pomegranate seeds are optional, but they sure do offer a lot of visual appeal, not to mention crunchy pops of sweet tart flavor. You can use whatever pears you have around, making sure they are ripe but still firm so they hold their shape when diced. Try Bosc, Anjou or Bartlett.

            In a medium bowl, combine 2 diced ripe-but-firm pears, a minced ½ red onion, a couple of tablespoons pomegranate seeds, 1 teaspoon minced jalapeno, 1 tablespoon minced fresh cilantro, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, 1 tablespoon orange juice, and salt and pepper to taste.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797423,Black history class revised by College Board amid criticism,"BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) — High school senior Kahlila Bandele is used to courses that don’t address the African American experience. Then there’s her 9 a.m. class. This week, it spanned topics from Afro-Caribbean migration to jazz.

            The discussion in her Advanced Placement course on African American studies touched on figures from Marcus Garvey and Malcolm X to Jimi Hendrix and Rihanna. In her AP European History course, she said, “we’re not discussing Black people at all” — even though they were colonized by Europeans.

            Her school in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, is one of 60 schools around the country testing the new course, which has gained national attention since Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis threatened to ban it in his state. The rejection has stirred new political debate over how schools teach about race.











            The official curriculum for the course, released Wednesday by the College Board, downplays some components that had drawn criticism from DeSantis and other conservatives. Topics including Black Lives Matter, slavery reparations and queer life are not part of the exam. Instead, they are included only on a sample list states and school systems can choose from for student projects. 

            The College Board, which oversees AP exams, said revisions to the course were substantially complete before DeSantis shared his objections. 

            “The fact of the matter is that this landmark course has been shaped over years by the most eminent scholars in the field, not political influence,” the organization said in a written statement.

            The revised curriculum will guide the course’s expansion to hundreds of additional high schools in the next academic year. College Board officials said developers consulted with professors from more than 200 colleges, including several historically Black institutions, and took input from teachers piloting the class.

            The students at Baton Rouge Magnet High School were aware of the political controversy over the course. But the class on Monday was filled with discussion of the Négritude and Negrismo movements that celebrated Black culture and a painting by the Afro-Asian-Latino artist Wifredo Lam.

            Afterward, Bandele, 18, said she doesn’t understand arguments that the course would indoctrinate children.

            “I don’t feel particularly indoctrinated,” she said.

            DeSantis, a possible Republican presidential candidate in 2024, said he was blocking the course in Florida because it pushed a political agenda.

            “In the state of Florida, our education standards not only don’t prevent, but they require teaching Black history, all the important things. That’s part of our core curriculum,” DeSantis said at a news conference last week. “We want education and not indoctrination.” 

            A spokesperson for DeSantis on Wednesday said the state education department is reviewing the revised curriculum for compliance with Florida law.

            Despite the College Board's assurances otherwise, the notion that the course changed because of political controversy generated fresh outrage Wednesday. “To wake up on the first day of Black History Month to news of white men in positions of privilege horse trading essential and inextricably linked parts of Black History, which is American history, is infuriating,” said David Johns, executive director of the National Black Justice Coalition. 

            The course has been popular among students in schools where it has been introduced. In Baton Rouge, so many students were interested that Emmitt Glynn is teaching it to two classes, instead of just the one he was originally planning.

            Earlier this week, his students read selections of “The Wretched of the Earth” by Frantz Fanon, which deals with the violence inherent in colonial societies. In a lively discussion, students connected the text to what they had learned about the conflict between colonizers and Native Americans, to the war in Ukraine and to police violence in Memphis, Tennessee.

            “We’ve been covering the gamut from the shores of Africa to where we are now in the 1930s, and we will continue on through history,” Glynn said. He said he was proud to see the connections his students were making between the past and now.

            For Malina Ouyang, 17, taking the class helped fill gaps in what she has been taught. “Taking this class,"" she said, ""I realized how much is not said in other classes.”

            Matthew Evans, 16, said the class has educated him on a multitude of perspectives on Black history. He said the political controversy is just “a distraction.”

            “Any time you want to try to silence something, you will only make someone want to learn about it even more,” he said.

            The College Board offers AP courses across the academic spectrum, including math, science, social studies, foreign languages and fine arts. The courses are optional. Taught at a college level, students who score high enough on the final exam usually earn course credit at their university.

            In Malcolm Reed's classroom at St. Amant High School in Louisiana, where he teaches the AP class, he tries to be mindful of how the material and discussions can affect students.

            “I give them the information and I've seen light bulbs go off. I ask them, ‘How does it affect you? How do you feel about learning this?’ ” he said. “It's also new for me, and I'm just taking it in stride. We're not just learning history, but we're making history.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797425,"Myanmar extends state of emergency, delaying expected polls","BANGKOK (AP) — Myanmar’s military government announced Wednesday that is extending a state of emergency it imposed when it seized power two years ago, a move that appears to set back its plans for an election that had been expected in August.

            The announcement on state-run MRTV television said the National Defense and Security Council, which met Tuesday, extended the state of emergency for another six months because the country remains in an abnormal situation and time is needed to prepare for a peaceful and stable election. The NDSC is nominally a constitutional administrative government body, but in practice is controlled by the military.

            No exact date has been announced for the polls, though the head of the ruling military council, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, has suggested they could be held in August. Wednesday's report said the election will be held after accomplishing the provisions of the state of emergency.











            The state of emergency allows the military to assume all government functions, giving Min Aung Hlaing legislative, judicial and executive powers.

            The announcement, on the anniversary of the army's seizure of power in 2021 from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, will be seen as an admission that the army has failed to quell widespread opposition to military rule, which includes increasingly challenging armed resistance as well as nonviolent protests and civil disobedience. State media said Tuesday’s NDSC meeting discussed how opposition groups are seeking to take power through “wrongful forcible means” including assassinations, bombings and destruction of state property. 

            The constitution stipulates that to hold an election, the military has to transfer government functions to the president, who heads the NDSC, six months before the polls, which in the current case would mean Acting President Myint Swe, an army ally.

            A spokesperson for the opposition’s underground National Unity Government, which acts as a shadow government opposed to army rule, said the extension was no surprise because they had expected the military would take some action to cement its control on the anniversary of its takeover.

            Nay Phone Latt said in a text message that his group and its allies have the support of the public, whose determination will continue until “revolution” is achieved.

            The military said its 2021 takeover was prompted by massive voting fraud in a November 2020 general election, though independent election observers did not find any major irregularities. Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy party won a landslide victory for a second term in the election, humiliating the military-backed opposition Union Solidarity and Development Party.

            Critics say the military-planned election will be neither free nor fair because there is no free media and most of the leaders of Suu Kyi’s party have been arrested or gone into hiding or exile. Suu Kyi, 77, is serving prison sentences totaling 33 years after being convicted in a series of politically tainted prosecutions brought by the military.

            Last week, the military government enacted a new law on registration of political parties that makes it difficult for opposition groups to mount a serious challenge to army-backed candidates in a general election. 

            The National League for Democracy declared last November that it will not accept or recognize the military-planned election, which it described as “fake.” It said the polls are an attempt by the military to gain political legitimacy and international recognition.

            Opposition militants have been attempting to disrupt preparations for the election by attacking personnel of the military government who are conducting a population survey that could be used to assemble voter rolls. 

            ""Upon accomplishing the provisions of the state of emergency, free and fair elections will be held in line with the 2008 constitution, and further work will be undertaken to hand over state duties to the winning party in accordance with the democratic standards,” Min Aung Hlaing declared at a Jan. 4 celebration of Myanmar’s independence day in the capital, Naypyitaw,BANGKOK (AP) — Myanmar’s military government announced Wednesday that is extending a state of emergency it imposed when it seized power two years ago, a move that appears to set back its plans for an election that had been expected in August.The announcement on state-run MRTV television said the National Defense and Security Council, which met Tuesday, extended the state of emergency for another six months because the country remains in an abnormal situation and time is needed to prepare for a peaceful and stable election.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797437,Munich Philharmonic names Lahav Shani next chief conductor,"Lahav Shani will take over as chief conductor of the Munich Philharmonic, a leading German and international orchestra, starting September 2026. The announcement was made Wednesday morning by the mayor of Munich, Dieter Reiter, who underscored the freshness Shani would bring to the orchestra as one of the youngest chief conductors in the ensemble's history.""Lahav Shani is a perfect fit for the Munich Philharmonic. The city orchestra, with its tradition and renown, has been rejuvenated and is awakening a new excitement for classical music,"" Reiter said.Shani's appointment was decided by the Munich City Council on the recommendation of the orchestra. The musician was present in Munich to sign the contract.""I met the orchestra just last year for the first time, and the relationship was immediately very strong and very promising for the future, and so it's a big promise, and I'm so much looking forward to the next years,"" Shani said in a video posted to his Instagram account and the Munich Philharmonic's Twitter account following the contract signing.Shani's appointment comes roughly one year after his predecessor, the prominent Russian conductor Valery Gergiev, was dismissed from the position for failing to denounce the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The 69-year-old Gergiev has openly maintained close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin for years.With Shani, the Munich Philharmonic has acquired a musical star who has appeared with top international ensembles, not just as a conductor, but also as a pianist and a bassist.Born in Tel Aviv in 1989, Shani was immersed in classical music from a young age. ""My father was a choir conductor, and music was always part of my life. I grew up with it. At home, on video tapes, and my father would take me to rehearsals and performances by the Israel Philharmonic,"" he said in an interview for the London Symphony Orchestra blog.Shani began studying piano at age 6 and at 18 soloed with the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra under the ensemble's long-term music director Zubin Mehta. Since then, Shani has maintained strong ties to the Israeli orchestra, performing as a pianist and bassist with the ensemble, appearing as a regular guest conductor every year since 2013 and eventually taking over the music director position from Mehta in 2020.A musical multi-talent, Shani's initial focus wasn't on conducting but performing as an instrumentalist.""Then I was more and more attracted to the idea of making musical decisions, leading the orchestra in a certain way that I thought was the right way for me, very subjective,"" he told US public radio station WRTI.Shani pursued conducting studies alongside piano in Berlin, where he was mentored by Argentine-Israeli pianist and conductor Daniel Barenboim.His conducting breakthrough came in 2013, when he won the Gustav Mahler Conducting Competition in Bamberg, a prestigious international competition that has helped launch the careers of top conductors like Gustavo Dudamel, Oksana Lyniv and Shi-Yeon Sung.In 2018 Shani became chief conductor of the Rotterdam Philharmonic at age 27, making him the youngest person ever to hold the position.The classical music world is one in which top musicians can maintain prominent, active careers well into their 70s, 80s, or even beyond. Musicians up through their 40s are often referred to as ""young"" or ""emerging"" — sometimes despite having years of professional experience under their belts.At 34, Shani has already led some of the most prestigious orchestras including the Vienna Philharmonic, the Berlin Philharmonic, the Boston Symphony Orchestra and  Amsterdam's Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, among others. In announcing his appointment, the Munich Philharmonic leadership described it as a ""generational change.""Shani has maintained that it is not age but rather the connection between an orchestra and the conductor that determines the potential for working well together.""You can have a very young conductor coming to a great orchestra, and it will work — as it did in our case,"" Shani said of his relationship with the Rotterdam Philharmonic in a 2022 interview with Bachtrack. ""You can have an older and very famous conductor coming to a great orchestra, and even with very high expectations on both sides, it's somehow not working because there is no chemistry. They don't understand each other well, or they have very different approaches and cannot really communicate.""Shani will stop leading the Dutch ensemble when his contract expires in 2026 — just in time to take up the reins at the Munich Philharmonic. His initial term as chief conductor of the Bavarian ensemble will last five years.Disclosure: The author of this article was employed by Shani's management agency in 2016.Edited by: Elizabeth Grenier",2023/02/01,,

""We can't rule out internal assistance but since the investigation is still in progress, I will not be able to share more details.""A senior official separately told AFP, on condition of anonymity, that police had detained 23 people in connection with the attack. The official also confirmed that they were investigating possible help from the inside, adding that they were looking into possible connections with groups outside of Pakistan.On Monday, a suicide bomber blew himself up inside a mosque in a security compound in Peshawar during afternoon worship. More than 300 worshippers were in the building at the time.It remained unclear how the attacker entered the high-security area, home to police and regional government headquarters, with explosives.The head of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province police force, Moazzam Jah Ansari, had said on Tuesday that the attacker had entered the mosque as a guest before exploding 10 to 12 kilograms (about 22 to 26 pounds) of explosive material that had been brought into the compound beforehand.No group has yet claimed responsibility for the attack. The Pakistani Taliban denied it had been involved after an initial assertion by one of its commanders.The region — which runs along the border with Afghanistan — has seen a steady increase in violence since the Taliban took control of Pakistan's neighbor in August 2021.Monday's attack was the deadliest in Peshawar since the 2013 suicide bombings of a Christian church.Pakistan, which is facing numerous issues including violence, economic problems and the fallout of largescale flooding in 2022, is also preparing for elections later this year.ab, tg/nm (Reuters, AFP)",2023/02/01,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797439,Is Bangladesh getting tired of hosting Rohingya refugees?,"In 2017, Bangladesh welcomed fellow Muslims from Myanmar's troubled Rakhine state to the southern coastal community of Cox's Bazar with open arms, food and shelter.Despite the presence of hundreds of thousands of Rohingya in the already overcrowded settlements for decades, they didn't have to think twice about accommodating the new surge of people, albeit into an already overcrowded area of Bangladesh.Attempts to repatriate the Rohingya refugees have failed due to unstable conditions in Myanmar. As such, they have become victims of the worst refugee crisis in the last 50 years .In 1971, some 10 million East Pakistanis sought refuge in India during Bangladesh's independence war against Pakistan. But unlike the Rohingya, they returned home within nine months.""The conflicts between the host community and Rohingya refugees are increasing; they are frequently getting involved into conflicts these days,"" according to Imran Hossain, government administrator for Ukhiya town which hosts one of the world's largest refugee camps.Abdur Rashid used to be an affluent landlord in southeastern Bangladesh. He allowed refugees to stay next to his land when they arrived in August 2017. Now he walks past his once-agricultural land, angry and frustrated because it has since been transformed into a barren swamp full of polythene, excrement and mosquitoes next to Cox's Bazar's sprawling Balukhali camp.The 72-year-old retired farmer blames refugees for ""ruining"" his 10-acre plot of land.""This land was so fertile. We used to harvest paddies twice in a year that fed my family well,"" he said.""Look what they have done!"" Rashid yelled, shaking in anger and breaking down in tears.But life is also tough for the refugees.With no scope of regular work, movement and meaningful education, 1 million refugees see no future, explained Rohingya community leader Abu Jafar.""It only makes sense how easy it has become these days to exploit fit-but-jobless Rohingya youths for organized crimes,"" he told DW, referring to crimes ranging from  methamphetamine pill trafficking to murders.Salam Mia is a Tuk-Tuk driver in Cox's Bazar's Ukhiya area who usually rents a rickshaw to earn a living. But in the last few years, he's had to deal with fresh competition for work.""If I delay reaching the garage, then I don't get to rent a rickshaw that day. Which means I cannot buy food for my children,"" the 25-year-old father of three said.""Why? Because a Rohingya driver probably would have booked it paying more rent! These refugees are literally kicking on our stomach by stealing our jobs.""The standard salary for a Bangladeshi farmhand is 600 taka (just over €5; $5.6) per day when Rohingya men offer the same job for half the price, according to a local mason.""Even construction shroffs from nearby towns often take truck loads of Rohingya workers for masonry work,"" the mason said, on condition of anonymity.Syed Harunur Rashid, a police officer at the camp, admitted that it's ""easy for the refugees"" to sneak past the police in the hilly terrain.""They cut down the barbed wire at over 160 places and created passages to the outer world,"" he told DW.Mohammad Shahjahan, a 13-year-old Rohingya refugee from the Leda camp, was badly injured by a pellet which had been shot from a homemade gun by suspected drug traffickers. His was accused of being a drug mule, a charge he denies.A few of Mohammad's friends went missing from the refugee settlement. Days later, their decomposed corpses were seen floating in the Naf river which divides Bangladesh and Myanmar.Drug cartels in Bangladesh's coastal town of Teknaf are suspected of using Rohingya youths as lieutenants and drug mules. The narcotic traffickers have turned to violence and kidnappings.In late December, armed Rohingya men abducted eight Bangladeshi farmers. Four days later, they were returned only after paying a hefty ransom of 640,000 taka.""Families of these poor farmers had to borrow money with huge interest to pay the ransom,"" local councilor Rashed Mahmud Ali said.Law enforcement agencies also claimed that groups of Islamist extremists are trying to set up a base inside the camp.Last week, the elite Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) exchanged fire with suspected extremists in Kutupalong refugee camp, which further angered the locals.Nur Sadek, a 19-year-old Rohingya — who was recently rescued after setting out on a perilous voyage towards Malaysia on a rickety boat — admitted that he ""did not find any other option.""""Though it was a mistake, I foresaw no end to this misery we are in and I became desperate,"" the teen said, breaking down in tears. ""What is our destiny? What should we do then?""Refugee and migration crisis expert Professor Shahab Enam Khan said the end to this unrest solution lies only in Myanmar where a military junta has ""no genuine interest"" in repatriation.Until then, the refugee camps should become a self-sustaining economic ecosystem, he suggested.""The government and the international community must work to build entrepreneurial skills to let the refugees have gainful economic opportunities,"" the University of Delaware Fulbright professor said.The UNHCR says it receives regular complaints about abductions, disappearances, threats or physical attacks by armed groups and criminal gangs involved in illegal activities along with gender-based, domestic and neighborhood violence.""Mediation is provided to prevent escalation of conflicts. UNHCR has also enhanced its presence in the camps, and increased monitoring activities,"" UNHCR spokeswoman Regina De La Portilla said.""Protection and assistance services, including psychosocial support, are being provided to respond to the specific needs of individuals.""But the once-warm welcome for the refugees has cooled.""The Rohingya have already overstayed their welcome,"" Rahman, also a lawyer, said.Refugee leaders say that such a belligerent attitude would only deteriorate the mutual respect.""We are just stuck and strangled in a very odd position. As if we don't even exist,"" said Sadek, wiping away his tears.Edited by: Keith Walker",2023/02/01,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797440,More undocumented Indians attempt to enter the United States,"During a speech in January, Georgia Congressman Rich McCormick said that Indian Americans are ""some of the best citizens we have in America"" and called for a ""streamlined"" immigration process for those who have come to the United States to ""obey the law, pay their taxes and be the most creative and productive in society.""Although Americans of Indian origin are often presented in this manner as ""model"" migrants, an increased number of Indians sought unauthorized entry to the US in 2022, according to US Customs and Border Patrol data.In 2022, 63,927 undocumented Indians reached the US borders and sought asylum, which is more than double the previous year's figure. The US southern border with Mexico is a common arrival point.From October 2021 to September 2022, US border authorities stopped Indian migrants ""18,300 times"" at the US southern border, according to the Migration Policy Institute's (MPI) 2022 report on Indian immigration to the US. This is a spike from 2,600 encounters recorded the previous year.Lopita Nath, professor of history and Asian Studies at the University of the Incarnate Word in San Antonio, Texas, said that this increase in unauthorized Indian arrivals could serve to tarnish the positive image of Indian immigration.""If the numbers grow as exponentially as they are now, the Indian diaspora will not be very happy about it, because it gives a bad name to the legal migrants,"" she told DW.As of 2021, 2.7 million immigrants of Indian origin are living in the US, according to the MPI report.The Indians coming to the US are generally highly educated, and many Indians receive employer-sponsored H-1B temporary visas for high-skilled workers. Indians are also the second largest demographic of foreign students at US universities.However, a lower percentage of Indian immigrants become US citizens when compared to other groups.""Indians were less likely to be naturalized US citizens than immigrants overall, which may reflect the large numbers arriving on temporary visas and the relative recency of arrival,"" the report said.New York-based immigration lawyer Rohit Biswas told DW that with the legal pathway to naturalization getting tougher, more and more Indians may opt to either enter illegally or flout visa laws.""We have an economic system that requires certain immigrants. And I don't think we have the immigration system that supports it,"" he saidStringent visa rules and organized migrant smuggling networks are also contributing to rising Indian encounters at the US border, said S Irudaya Rajan, chairman of the International Institute of Migration and Development in the southern Indian city of Thiruvananthapuram.Although smuggling networks operate more on the southern US border, when it comes to Indians, the US-Canada border has seen a recent increase in encounters with undocumented migrants.In 2020, an Indian Uber driver was arrested for transporting people illegally across the border. A subsequent investigation revealed how this one arrest led to the uncovering of 90 similar people-smuggling trips.And many undocumented Indians are those who have overstayed their visa. It is a huge task to pinpoint every single visa overstayer in the US.Moreover, newly arrived undocumented Indians often find it easy to ""blend in"" with the sizable Indian diaspora, said Nath.""After they are let out from the detention centers, they go wherever they have friends, family connections,"" she said.However, Jeanne Batalova, one of the MPI report authors, said that undercounting the number of people living in a community can have long-term negative effects on funding and providing social services.Indian immigrants in the US have high labor market participation, with 72% of Indian immigrants aged 16 and older in the 2021 civilian labor force, according to MPI data. This is more than both foreign and US-born populations, whose labor market participation ranged respectively from 66 to 62%.Both Nath and Rajan said the recent emergence of a new middle class in India has allowed more people to afford the costs of migration.Preexisting networks within the Indian diaspora — and the image of success they present — also encourage Indians with money to take their shot at the ""American dream.""""Where there are networks, jobs, possibility of a family connection, that is where migrants are inclined to go,"" said Nath.""On the other hand, the domestic reality [of India] is out in the open. We noticed a lot of backlashes against minority communities, whether it is the Muslims, Christians, or on the basis of sexuality or gender,"" she added.The MPI report also cited ""growing religious and political persecution in India against non-Hindus"" as well as ""lack of domestic economic opportunities"" as contributing to Indians arriving at the US border.Edited by: Wesley Rahn",2023/02/01,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797444,South Africa government pursuing sponsor deal with Tottenham,"CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — The South African government is pursuing a sponsorship deal with Premier League club Tottenham, following in the footsteps of the United Arab Emirates, Rwanda, Malta and others who have used the world's biggest soccer league to promote their countries.

            South Africa's Ministry of Tourism said Wednesday it was looking to conclude a memorandum of understanding with Tottenham through SA Tourism, which is the tourism marketing arm of the government.

            South African media reports claimed the deal would be worth $52 million over three years from the start of the 2023-2024 season and give SA Tourism branding space on Tottenham's uniform, among other things. The Ministry of Tourism didn't give financial details of the deal and said it must still gain final approval from government. 











            Right now, the proposal was to conclude the memorandum of understanding with Tottenham, the ministry said.

            Tottenham's north London rival Arsenal has a ""Visit Rwanda"" message on its shirt sleeve, while UAE's two official airlines, Emirates and Etihad, are the principal sponsors of Arsenal and Manchester City, respectively.

            Manchester United has an agreement to promote the Mediterranean island nation of Malta.

            The proposed deal was criticized by a South African opposition party, which said the money reportedly involved — which is equivalent to more than 900 million South African rand — represented nearly 40% of SA Tourism's budget. The party, ActionSA, also questioned who would benefit from some of the other perks of the deal for South Africa.

            It “arguably has more to do with the benefit officials and politicians will derive from the agreement, including gaining access to stadium hospitality and tickets at Tottenham Hotspur games in London,” ActionSA said. 

            SA Tourism has been active in promoting South Africa after the country's important tourism sector was badly impacted by travel lockdowns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. SA Tourism has also partnered with streaming service Netflix to promote South Africa to potential international visitors.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797445,"Jamaica ready to send soldiers, police to quell Haiti chaos","SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — Jamaica’s prime minister said his government is willing to send soldiers and police officers to Haiti as part of a proposed multinational security assistance deployment.

            The announcement comes a week after U.N. special envoy for Haiti Helen La Lime said she hoped that the U.N. Security Council would deal “positively” with the pending request from Haiti’s government for international armed forces despite the U.S. and Canada showing no interest.

            Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness told the island’s House of Representatives on Tuesday that he wants to help Haiti and “support a return to a reasonable level of stability and peace, which would be necessary for any inclusive, democratic process to take root.”











            The announcement appears to mark the first time that a nation in the Western Hemisphere publicly offers boots on the ground after Haiti’s prime minister and other top officials requested the immediate deployment of foreign troops in early October amid a crippling fuel siege blamed on the country’s most powerful gang.

            U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres and La Lime have backed Haiti's plea to no avail.

            
                The U.N. Security Council has mulled the request but taken no action, opting instead to issue sanctions on people including Jimmy Chérizier, a dominant gang leader and former police officer blamed for masterminding multiple massacres.

            “It is our impression that the international community has not yet taken stock of the urgency of the situation that the Haitian people are facing,” Léon Charles, former chief of Haiti’s National Police, said Wednesday during an Organization of American States meeting.

            “My country is experiencing one of the most difficult moments in its history,” said Charles, who is Haiti’s permanent representative to the OAS.

            He likened the aid that Haiti has received so far from the international community to buckets of water to help put out a raging fire when what the country needs is firetrucks equipped with heavy-duty hoses.

            Meanwhile, Holness said Jamaica is ready to offer bilateral support if needed.

            “It is our real hope that Haiti will soon overcome her challenges and embark on a path toward restoration of stability, long-lasting peace and sustainable development for her land and people with the full backing of the international community,” he said.

            Vanessa Frazier, Malta's ambassador at the United Nations who is the current president of the Security Counil, said at a council meeting Tuesday that they welcomed Jamaica's declaration and added that it had yet to receive notifications from other countries.

            “Hopefully we will, because we understand that this … multinational security force is very important and is required on the ground in order to stabilize the situation in Haiti,"" she said.

            Jamaica is a member of a regional trade bloc known as Caricom, which last week issued a statement urging “all stakeholders to come together in their search for a consensus agreement” to resolve what it called a protracted political stalemate in Haiti, adding that it was prepared to hold a meeting in the Caribbean to talk about the issue.

            Haiti was stripped of all democratically elected institutions when the terms of the remaining 10 senators expired in early January. Prime Minister Ariel Henry has promised to hold general elections for more than a year, but a provisional electoral council has yet to be chosen, which some critics say has led to a de-facto dictatorship.

            Haiti also has been struggling with levels of violence not seen in decades ever since the July 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moïse at his private home, w ith gangs now believed to control 60% of the capital of Port-au-Prince.

            The number of reported kidnappings soared to 1,359 last year, double compared with the previous year, and reported killings have spike by a third to 2,183, according to the U.N.

            “These are truly chilling figures,” Charles said. “The situation in Haiti is extremely urgent.”

            Haiti’s National Police has fewer than 9,000 active police officers for a country of more than 11 million people who not only face a spike in violence but also deepening poverty, widespread hunger and a deadly cholera outbreak.

Prime Minister Ariel Henry has promised to hold general elections for more than a year, but a provisional electoral council has yet to be chosen, which some critics say has led to a de-facto dictatorship.Haiti also has been struggling with levels of violence not seen in decades ever since the July 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moïse at his private home, w ith gangs now believed to control 60% of the capital of Port-au-Prince.The number of reported kidnappings soared to 1,359 last year, double compared with the previous year, and reported killings have spike by a third to 2,183, according to the U.N.“These are truly chilling figures,” Charles said. “The situation in Haiti is extremely urgent.”Haiti’s National Police has fewer than 9,000 active police officers for a country of more than 11 million people who not only face a spike in violence but also deepening poverty, widespread hunger and a deadly cholera outbreak.___Associated Press reporter Edith M.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797446,'Dr. Phil' talk show to end daytime TV run after 21 years,"NEW YORK (AP) — Daytime television psychologist “Dr. Phil” McGraw says he plans to end his talk show after 21 years in the coming months, but viewers haven't seen the last of him.

            “Dr. Phil” was the most prominent spinoff from Oprah Winfrey's show, which once dominated daytime TV. The Texan's program debuted in September 2002 after he'd been featured as a regular guest on Winfrey's.

            “With this show, we have helped thousands of guest and millions of viewers through everything from addiction and marriage to mental wellness and raising children,” McGraw said in a statement. “This has been an incredible chapter of my life and career, but while I'm moving on from daytime, there is so much more I wish to do.”











            The traditional broadcast TV season ends in spring; there was no date given for Phil's final show.

            McGraw, 72, said he wants to focus on prime-time programming and is planning an unspecified project for early next year.

            In the meantime, while new “Dr. Phil” episodes won't be made, the show won't disappear from TV. CBS Media Ventures, which syndicates his program, said it will offer stations a package of reruns with occasional new wraparound content for future seasons.

            That's a cost-saving path blazed by “Judge Judy,” which aired its last original show in June 2021 but continues to be popular in reruns.

            “We plan to be in the ‘Dr. Phil’ business with the library for years to come and welcome opportunities to work together in the future,” said Steve LoCascio, president of CBS Media Ventures.NEW YORK (AP) — Daytime television psychologist “Dr. Phil” McGraw says he plans to end his talk show after 21 years in the coming months, but viewers haven't seen the last of him.“Dr. Phil” was the most prominent spinoff from Oprah Winfrey's show, which once dominated daytime TV.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797447,Spain's PM heads to Morocco to reap benefits of mended ties,"BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez traveled to Rabat on Wednesday along with 11 ministers for a meeting with Moroccan government officials, as part of the European country’s strategy to improve historically complex relations with its neighbor across the Strait of Gibraltar.

            The visit comes 10 months after Sánchez went to meet Moroccan King Mohammed VI and put an end to a diplomatic crisis that had erupted in 2021 regarding Morocco's disputed territory of Western Sahara. During that meeting, Sánchez declared “a new phase of bilateral relations” with Morocco, an important partner with the European Union in fighting extremism and aiding the bloc's irregular migration policies.

            Sánchez flew south again on Wednesday, a day before he will sit down with Moroccan Prime Minister Aziz Akhannouch, a billionaire businessman who won a 2021 election and is considered close to Mohammed VI.











            Akhannouch greeted Sánchez at Rabat's airport before they attended a forum with businesses from both countries.

            Sánchez’s agenda doesn't include another meeting with the Moroccan king, with whom he shared the Iftar meal to break the day’s fast during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan last April in the highlight of their reconciliation.

            Sánchez’s office said that the prime minister instead had a phone conversation with the monarch in which they agreed that the meeting would “contribute to consolidating this new era in the relations between Morocco and Spain.” It added that Sánchez accepted the invitation by the king to make another official visit to Rabat at an unspecified date.

            Moroccans make up the single largest foreign community with 800,000 residents in Spain, and important economic ties unite the neighbors which are separated by just 13 kilometers (8 miles) of water at the nearest point.

            But relations between Spain and Morocco were severely damaged in May 2021 after Spain allowed the leader of the Polisario Front, which has waged a low-intensity armed rebellion seeking the Western Sahara’s independence from Morocco, to receive medical treatment for COVID-19 in Spain.

            Morocco responded by relaxing its border controls around Spain’s North African exclave of Ceuta and thousands of people crossed over into the city. Tensions remained high until Sánchez did an about-face on Spain’s long-standing position on Western Sahara by backing Rabat’s proposal to give it more autonomy as long as it remains unquestionably under Moroccan control. Madrid maintains that the people of Western Sahara must decide their future via a referendum.

            Sánchez paid a high price for moving closer to Morocco.

            His shift on Western Sahara angered Algeria, a backer of the Polisario Front and major natural gas supplier to Spain. It was also widely criticized in Spain, which held Western Sahara as a colony until 1975, and caused friction inside Spain’s governing left-wing coalition between Sánchez’s Socialists and its junior partner. Politicians from across Spain's spectrum considered Sánchez to have betrayed the Sahrawi people of Western Sahara for very little tangible gains in return.

            Now, Sánchez is aiming to reap some benefits after last year’s return to diplomatic normalcy.

            This will be first meeting since 2015 with such a large delegation of ministries represented. Sánchez is taking along his ministers in charge of the economy, energy, foreign affairs, security and policing, agriculture, commerce, transport and migration, among others.

            Thursday's meeting between the governments is expected to produce several agreements between ministries and to favor business growth, including the opening of customs offices at the border crossings for Ceuta and its sister exclave, Melilla, which Morocco has never officially recognized as Spanish territories. Melilla’s customs office was closed by Morocco in 2018, while Ceuta has never had one.

            Spain is the largest foreign investor in Morocco, accounting for a significant chunk of all foreign investments, making economic cooperation a top priority for the Moroccan government. Morocco is Spain’s third most important non-EU commercial partner after the United States and Britain.

            Morocco, in similar fashion to Turkey and other countries in north Africa, has reaped economic benefits from the EU in exchange for curbing irregular immigration to Spain. That, however, has not stopped thousands of migrants and refugees, including young Moroccans looking for a better future in Europe, from attempting a dangerous crossing of the Mediterranean, or a perilous Atlantic journey to the Canary Islands.

            The frontier policing methods of both Spain and Morocco have fallen under intense scrutiny following the death of at least 23 African men, many reportedly refugees from Sudan, when they stormed a border fence at Melilla in June.

            Rights group Amnesty International held a protest outside the seat of Spain’s government in Madrid on Wednesday, with cutout silhouettes of the victims of the Melilla tragedy. The rights group raises the number of deaths to 37 and says that 77 more people are still missing from the incident.

            “A summit today between Morocco and Spain pretends to ignore what happened just seven months ago,” Esteban Beltrán, head of Amnesty International in Spain, said. “We want to remember that (the victims) are with us, and we want to remember the suffering of their families who have no information or a real investigation of what happened.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797448,Welsh choir won't sing 'Delilah' amid rugby sexism claims,"CARDIFF, Wales (AP) — A popular song by Tom Jones that has been a regular feature at Welsh sporting events will not be performed at the Six Nations tournament amid allegations of sexism, bullying and racism at the Welsh Rugby Union.

            “Delilah,” which was first released in 1968, contains lyrics that are “problematic and upsetting to some supporters,” read a statement issued Wednesday on behalf of the WRU.

            The song is about a jealous lover seeing a woman, Delilah, with another man. One line reads: “I crossed the street to her house and she opened the door; she stood there laughing, I felt the knife in my hand and she laughed no more.”











            It will not be sung by a male-voice choir before Wales’ match against Ireland in the Six Nations on Saturday or at future games. Wales also plays at home against England in Round 3 of the tournament.

            “Delilah will not feature on the playlist for choirs for rugby internationals at Principality Stadium,” read the statement from the venue. “The WRU removed the song from its halftime entertainment and music playlist during international matches in 2015.

            “Guest choirs have also more recently been requested not to feature the song during their pre-match performances and throughout games. The WRU condemns domestic violence of any kind.”

            WRU chief executive Steve Phillips quit Sunday amid claims of a toxic culture at the organization. It came after a BBC documentary contained allegations of misogyny, sexism, racism and homophobia at the governing body.

            British newspaper The Daily Telegraph reported the WRU moved quickly after a news channel showed footage of a choir rehearsing “Delilah” before its appearance at the Wales-England match on Feb. 25.

            In 2020, England’s Rugby Football Union reviewed the context of England’s rugby anthem — “Swing Low, Sweet Chariot” — amid the Black Lives Matter protests.

            The song is believed to have its roots in American slavery, with its credited author being Wallace Willis — a freed slave from Oklahoma.

            The RFU didn’t ban the singing of the song but said it would “proactively” educate fans on the song’s history.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797450,Live updates | Funeral for Tyre Nichols,"MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) — Live Updates on the funeral for Tyre Nichols (all times local):

            3:15 p.m.

            Many mourners wiped away tears as Tyre Nichols ' sisters, brothers and parents shared their memories at the funeral of the Black man who died after being beaten by Memphis police officers.











            Nichols' mother, RowVaughn Wells, said her faith has given her some comfort in the weeks since his killing.

            “The only thing that’s keeping me going is that I truly believe that my son was sent here on assignment from God. And I guess now his assignment is done. He’s gone home,” Wells said through tears.

            Earlier in the service Wednesday, Vice President Kamala Harris took to the stage to urge Congress to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, aimed at stamping out police brutality. Nichols' mother made a heart-wrenching plea for its passage.

            “That George Floyd bill, we need it passed,"" Wells said. ""We need to take some action because there should be no other child that should suffer the way my son — and all the other parents here have lost their children — we need to get that bill passed. Because if we don’t, that blood — the next child that dies — that blood is going to be on their hands.” 

            LaToya Yizar, who says her mother was Nichols' godmother, read a poem she wrote invoking words Nichols said as police officers beat him just minutes from his home, titled, “I’m Just Trying To Go Home”

            2:58 p.m.

            The Rev. Al Sharpton has told mourners at the funeral of Tyre Nichols, that the Black man's death after being beaten by Black police officers in Memphis, Tennessee, reminded him of the legacy of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King. Jr. 

            King was shot and killed on April 4, 1968, in Memphis where he had been supporting a sanitation workers' strike after two workers were killed by a malfunctioning truck. Most of the strikers were Black. 

            Sharpton said that earlier Wednesday he took his daughter Ashley to the spot where King was shot at the former Lorraine Motel, which is now the National Civil Rights Museum.

            He then directly addressed Nichols' mother and stepfather, RowVaughn and Rodney Wells.

            “The reason why, Mr. and Mrs. Wells, what happened to Tyre is so personal to me, is that five Black men that wouldn’t have had a job in the police department, would not ever be thought of to be in an elite squad, in the city that Dr. King lost his life, not far away from that balcony, you beat a brother to death,” Sharpton said. “There’s nothing more insulting and offensive to those of us that fight to open doors, that you walk through those doors and act like the folks we had to fight for to get you through them doors.”

            2:29 p.m.

            The Rev. Al Sharpton has delivered a rousing sermon at the funeral of Tyre Nichols, a Black motorist who died after he was beaten by police in Memphis, Tennessee, this month.

            Sharpton said some police officers act as if they are above the law.

            “You don’t fight crime by becoming criminals yourself,"" he said. ""You don’t stand up to thugs in the street becoming thugs yourself. You don’t fight gangs by becoming five armed men against an unarmed man. That ain’t the police. That’s punks.”

            Five Black officers were fired following Nichols' death and charged with second-degree murder, aggravated assault, aggravated kidnapping, official misconduct and official oppression.

            Sharpton warned that despite the race of those five officers, they were still motivated by racism, saying: “If that man had been white, you wouldn’t have beat him like that.”

            2:05 p.m.

            Vice President Kamala Harris has called for Congress to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act while addressing mourners at the funeral service for Tyre Nichols.

            Harris, who got a standing ovation as she approached the stage, said the police beating of Nichols in Memphis, Tennessee, leading to his death three days later, should never have happened. She said the police are supposed to protect the public.

            ""This violent act was not in pursuit of public safety,” Harris said. 

            She continued: “Tyre Nichols should have been safe.”

            She went on to call for legislative action, saying the president supports the bill.

            ""As vice president of the United States, we demand that Congress pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. Joe Biden will sign it. And we should not delay and we will not be denied. It is nonnegotiable.”

            The pastor of the Mississippi Boulevard Christian Church is urging mourners to comfort the family and celebrate the life of Tyre Nichols.

            Vice President Kamala Harris was seated at the front of the church for the funeral service in Memphis, Tennessee, on Wednesday. The Rev. Al Sharpton and civil rights attorney Ben Crump were also in attendance.

            Pastor J. Lawrence Turner said Nichols was “a good person, a beautiful soul, a son, a father, a brother, a friend, a human being, gone too soon, denied his rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, denied the dignity of his humanity, denied the right to see the sun set another day, to embrace his mother, hang out with his friends, hold his child, and the right to grow old.”

            Nichols was brutally beaten by Memphis police officers this month just minutes from him home and died three days later.

            Mourners also watched a montage of photos taken by Nichols, who was an avid photographer, beginning with a slide bearing his own words: “My vision is to bring my viewers deep into what I am seeing through my eye and out through my lens.

            ___

            1:15 p.m.

            The funeral service for Tyre Nichols began Wednesday afternoon with a choir walking to the front of the Mississippi Boulevard Christian Church singing “We love you Tyre.” 

            The choir amassed behind Nichols' black casket, which was draped in a large white bouquet.

            After Nichols' family filed into the church, the Mississippi Boulevard Celebration Choir sang “Strength Like No Other,” bringing most of the mourners in attendance to their feet.

            ___

            The funeral program for Tyre Nichols includes numerous photos he took and his personal quotes.

            “My vision is to bring my viewers deep into what I am seeing through my eye and out through my lens,” reads one quote laid over a photo of Nichols standing in an open field.

            Several pages of the program also have text laid over sunset photos Nichols took. Nichols’ family said photography was one of his hobbies, and he had been taking photos of the sunset before his encounter with police Jan. 7.

            Two bridges in Memphis will be illuminated in the colors of the San Francisco 49ers football team starting at sundown Wednesday in honor of Tyre Nichols, Mighty Lights Memphis tweeted.

            Nichols grew up in Sacramento and was a fan of the NFL team based in California. Lights in the team's colors, red and gold, will be shined on the Big River Crossing bridge and the Hernando de Soto bridge, the Mighty Lights group said.

            According to the Mighty Lights website, Memphis Bridge Lighting, Inc. was formed as a nonprofit organization to use lighting on the bridges to promote activity on the city's riverfront and provide a “unifying symbol” for Memphis residents.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797451,FBI searches Biden's vacation home; no classified documents,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The FBI searched President Joe Biden’s vacation home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, on Wednesday without turning up any classified documents, the latest turn in an extraordinary series of searches of his and his predecessor's properties.

            Agents did take some handwritten notes and other materials relating to Biden's time as vice president for review, just as they had when they searched his Wilmington home last month where they also found classified items. Investigators searched his former office at a Washington think tank that bears his name in November, but it isn't clear whether they took anything.

            The Biden searches, conducted with his blessing, have come as investigators work to determine how classified information from his time as a senator and vice president came to wind up in his home and former office — and whether any mishandling involved criminal intent or was merely a mistake in a city where unauthorized treatment of classified documents is not unheard-of. 











            Law enforcement searches of property are a routine part of criminal probes, but there is nothing ordinary about the FBI scouring a sitting president's home, even as Biden and his aides have sought to contrast his actions with those of his predecessor.

            Former President Donald Trump is facing a special counsel criminal investigation into his retention of several hundred classified documents and other government records at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida — and his resistance to giving them up, which led to an FBI warrant and search to seize them last August.

            On Wednesday, Biden's personal attorney Bob Bauer said FBI agents authorized by the Department of Justice spent three and a half hours searching the president's beach home and that “no documents with classified markings were found.”

            In a statement disclosing the search, Bauer sought to portray Biden and his team as fully transparent and cooperative. He described the search as “planned” and “a further step in a thorough and timely DOJ process we will continue to fully support and facilitate.”

            He did not mention Trump by name, but the statement seemed aimed at juxtaposing the Biden investigation with the Trump case, where months of fruitless Justice Department efforts to recover all the classified records taken to the former president's Florida estate culminated in the August search warrant and removal of nearly three dozen boxes of documents and other items.

            Searches of Biden's former office and Delaware homes, by contrast, have all been done voluntarily and without a warrant. But the fact the FBI did its own search reflected the Justice Department’s determination to retrieve any and all possible classified items rather than rely on assurances that such documents had been located.

            Biden has said he was surprised by the initial trove discovered by his lawyers in November when they were cleaning out an office inside the Penn Biden Center. 

            The latest search follows the FBI's 13-hour, top-to-bottom check of his Wilmington, Delaware, home, where agents located documents with classified markings from his time as a vice president and senator and also took possession of some of his handwritten notes. 

            One week earlier, Biden's personal lawyers revealed that they had found a document bearing classified markings while searching the Wilmington property but said they had not found others during a separate inspection of the Rehoboth Beach home.

            The White House did not disclose the Justice Department's investigation until last month, when it acknowledged the Nov. 2 discovery of a “small number” of classified documents by Biden lawyers as they closed an office at the Penn Biden Center, a think tank affiliated with the Ivy League school. 

            Though officials have not disclosed this, The Associated Press and other news organizations reported on Tuesday that the FBI had conducted a voluntary search of that office later in November.

            The administration’s public response has been delayed and incomplete. There are many unanswered questions - on what information the documents contained, exactly how many were discovered and why he had them in his possession, despite Biden’s attorneys and the White House Counsel’s insistence they are being as transparent as possible with the public. 

            “I think we’ve been pretty transparent from the very beginning,” a spokesman for the White House Counsel’s office, Ian Sams, said Wednesday. ""We want to be careful to be very respectful of the integrity of that ongoing investigation.”

            Sams reiterated that Biden was working with Justice investigators. 

            “The president has been fully cooperative in offering unprecedented access to his home ... every single room of his home in Rehoboth as well as the one in Wilmington,” he said. 

            The Justice Department declined comment on the Wednesday search.

            Biden's lawyers have described the retention of the records as a “mistake."" The Justice Department has historically brought criminal charges related to mishandling of classified records only when it can establish, among other things, that a person acted knowingly in improperly removing or storing sensitive records.

            The Biden documents probe is being handled by a special counsel, Robert Hur, a former senior Justice Department official during the Trump administration who served as the top federal prosecutor in Baltimore. He is starting his work this week, inheriting a months-long investigation already undertaken by FBI agents and Justice Department prosecutors. 

            Attorney General Merrick Garland had assigned the U.S. attorney in Chicago, John Lausch, to conduct an initial review before announcing Hur's appointment last month.

            In a separate effort that preceded the Biden probe, special counsel Jack Smith is investigating the retention by Trump of roughly 300 documents with classified markings that were taken from the White House to Mar-a-Lago. Agents last August obtained a search warrant to recover classified documents following what the Justice Department said were months of resistance by Trump and his representatives to return the records to the government. 

            Investigators in the Biden case have already conducted interviews, including of Biden's former executive assistant who helped oversee the packing of boxes that went to the Penn Biden Center. It is not yet clear if and when the Justice Department might look to question Biden himself.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797455,"Job market still hot, December openings rise to 11 million","WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. job openings rose to 11 million in December, delivering a setback to the Federal Reserve's effort to cool a hot job market.

            Openings were up from 10.44 million in November and were the highest since July, according to data released Wednesday by the Labor Department. Economists had expected job openings to drop slightly in December. 

            For 18 straight months, employers have posted at least 10 million openings — a level never reached before 2021 in Labor Department data going back to 2000. The number of openings in December meant that there were about two vacancies for every unemployed American.











            Employers hired 6.17 million workers in December, up from 6.03 million in November. 

            Still, layoffs and discharges blipped up to 1.47 million in December from 1.42 million in November. And the number of Americans quitting their jobs — a sign they have confidence they can find a better opportunities elsewhere — fell slightly in December.

            Hotels, restaurants and bars accounted for more than 70% of the December increase in job openings. 

            The American job market has been surprisingly resilient throughout this period of economic uncertainty. 

            Employers created 375,000 jobs a month in 2022 — second most in Labor Department records dating back to 1940 — and likely added another 185,000 last month, according to a survey of forecasters by the data firm FactSet. January's hiring numbers come out Friday.

            Hiring has remained strong even in the face of rising interest rates, which can increase costs for businesses. Combating inflation that last year hit a four-decade high, the Federal Reserve has hiked its benchmark rate seven times since March and is expected to announce another rate hike later Wednesday.

            Fed policymakers are aiming for a soft landing — slowing the economy enough to contain inflation without causing much economic pain. One hope was that that employers would cut job openings — and ease upward pressure on wages that can feed inflation — and without actually cutting many jobs.

            “With Fed officials hoping for signs of slowing hiring to support wage growth deceleration, every data point matters,'' said Matthew Martin, U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. “The December report unfortunately offered the opposite ... showcasing the stubborn resiliency of the labor market.''

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797456,Brazil authorities probe Amazon ties to capital attacks,"SAO PAULO (AP) — On the edge of Brazil’s Amazon rainforest, the Rovaris family is a symbol of a pioneering success story. 

            The family arrived in the state of Mato Grosso in the 1970s as part of a wave of agricultural expansion promoted by the country’s then-military dictatorship. In a short span, the Rovaris clan accumulated vast wealth as agronomists figured out how to successfully grow soy in the hostile tropical climate.

            Now, the family’s scion, Atilio Rovaris, is being investigated in the sprawling criminal probe into how supporters of former President Jair Bolsonaro tried to subvert Brazil’s democracy when they blocked highways right after the election and temporarily took over several government buildings in the capital of Brasilia in early January. Bolsonaro lost October's election to President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, a result that many Bolsonaro supporters don't accept. 











            Much of the investigation is centered along the northern stretch of highway BR-163, built in the 1970s. It connects two of Bolsonaro’s most substantial support bases. In Mato Grosso, these are Rovaris and other businesspeople from wealthy cities such as Sorriso, Brazil’s largest soybean producer. In Para, they are land-grabbers, illegal gold miners, and loggers who sustain impoverished cities such as Novo Progresso, 700 km (438 miles) north of Sorriso.

            Days after the failed takeover, Justice Minister Flávio Dino said that “agribusiness sectors” were among the leading financiers. And Environment Minister Marina Silva said some of the rioters were linked to criminal activities in the Amazon.

            “A significant portion of the enraged crowd were individuals who, under the Bolsonaro government, believed their criminal activities, such as deforestation, land grabbing, illegal logging, illegal fishing, and illegal mining, would go unpunished,” Silva told daily Folha de S.Paulo a few days after the Jan. 8 attack. 

            Bolsonaro won by big margins in population centers along the highway, as many people in theses areas share his view that Brazil needs to push economic growth by rolling back environmental regulations aimed at slowing deforestation. They deem conservation units and Indigenous territories as barriers that undermine agribusiness. Protected areas in the region are reeling from invasions from cattle farmers, loggers and gold miners.

            That so much support for Bolsonaro came from these areas could complicate Lula's promise to reach “zero deforestation” in the Amazon, as such efforts will require the buy in of locals and must be joined with sustainable forms of development. 

            Rovaris, an amateur rally car driver, has made no secret of his support for Bolsonaro. He was one of the biggest donors to his presidential campaign, contributing close to $100,000, according to public election data. 

            Although no evidence in the fledgling probe has emerged publicly tying him to the rioters who vandalized Brazil’s presidential palace and congress, he is being investigating for alleged support of protests that blocked major highways for weeks in attempts to restore Bolsonaro to power after the lost the elections in October. 

            In November, a bank account belonging to a trucking company that Rovaris owns was one of 43 frozen by the Supreme Court as part of an investigation into possible crimes against Brazil’s democracy. In total, 30 of the frozen accounts belonged to individuals or companies from Mato Grosso — a sign of how deep support for Bolsonaro remains in one of Brazil’s key economic hubs.

            “There is a repeated abuse of the right of assembly, directed illicitly and criminally, to propagate non-compliance and disrespect for the result of the election for president,” Justice Alexandre de Moraes wrote in the ruling.

            Rovaris merely supported Bolsonaro in the campaign and had no involvement in anti-democratic acts, Larissa Gribler, his spokesperson, told The Associated Press. Gribler said Rovaris declined to answer further questions or give an interview. 

            During his first term as president, between 2003 and 2006, Lula started paving BR-163, a job later completed by Bolsonaro. As part of the environmental licensing to authorize the paving, conservation units were created along the highway. The goal was to “close the agriculture border” to prevent uncontrolled deforestation, as had happened in Mato Grosso.

            In the Novo Progresso region in Para state, these conservation units have been largely invaded by land-grabbers, who have fought to annul them. The most prominent example is Jamanxin National Forest, the most deforested federal conservation unit in the Amazon.

            A roadblock there lasted several days in November. Footage shows police cars being attacked with stones by an angry mob and a felled Brazil Nuts tree, a protected species, across the road. According to local press reports, about 30 Novo Progresso residents were arrested in Brasilia following the attack. Those included the owner of a sawmill.

            ""The city relies on illegal activities such as illegal gold mining, illegally harvested wood, cattle raised in off-limits areas within conservation units, and land grabbing,” said Mauricio Torres, a geographer from Para Federal University.

            “Bolsonaro supported these illegal activities. And the people are willing to kill and die for it because they have no other option. So I don’t know how Lula will be able to implement the rule of law,"" he added.

            That is a different situation from Sorriso, where initial deforestation and land-grabbing were legalized decades ago, and the economy depends on soybean exports, Torres said.

            Just as the profile of the Amazonian strongholds for Bolsonaro differ, combatting deforestation will require different approaches, depending on the place, according to deforestation experts. 

            Lula's administration will have to act on many fronts, said Brenda Brito from Amazon Institute of People and the Environment, a group focused on sustainable development in the Amazon. It will have to reverse court decisions that have favored land-grabbers inside conservation units and a offer wide range of economic incentives, from forest land concessions to supporting ecotourism. 

            “Otherwise, even if we manage to remove invaders, the protected areas will be invaded again,” she said.

The goal was to “close the agriculture border” to prevent uncontrolled deforestation, as had happened in Mato Grosso.In the Novo Progresso region in Para state, these conservation units have been largely invaded by land-grabbers, who have fought to annul them. The most prominent example is Jamanxin National Forest, the most deforested federal conservation unit in the Amazon.A roadblock there lasted several days in November. Footage shows police cars being attacked with stones by an angry mob and a felled Brazil Nuts tree, a protected species, across the road. According to local press reports, about 30 Novo Progresso residents were arrested in Brasilia following the attack. Those included the owner of a sawmill.""The city relies on illegal activities such as illegal gold mining, illegally harvested wood, cattle raised in off-limits areas within conservation units, and land grabbing,” said Mauricio Torres, a geographer from Para Federal University.“Bolsonaro supported these illegal activities. And the people are willing to kill and die for it because they have no other option. So I don’t know how Lula will be able to implement the rule of law,"" he added.That is a different situation from Sorriso, where initial deforestation and land-grabbing were legalized decades ago, and the economy depends on soybean exports, Torres said.Just as the profile of the Amazonian strongholds for Bolsonaro differ, combatting deforestation will require different approaches, depending on the place, according to deforestation experts.Lula's administration will have to act on many fronts, said Brenda Brito from Amazon Institute of People and the Environment, a group focused on sustainable development in the Amazon. It will have to reverse court decisions that have favored land-grabbers inside conservation units and a offer wide range of economic incentives, from forest land concessions to supporting ecotourism.“Otherwise, even if we manage to remove invaders, the protected areas will be invaded again,” she said.___Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797461,Cryptocurrency fraud scheme lands man 8 years in prison,"BOSTON (AP) — The founder of a cryptocurrency and virtual payment services company who authorities say cheated dozens of investors out of about $7.5 million, which he used to buy a house, cars, jewelry, and other luxuries, has been sentenced to more than eight years in prison. 

            Randall Crater, 52, founded Las Vegas-based My Big Coin Pay Inc. in 2013, offering virtual payment services through a fraudulent digital currency, My Big Coin, from 2014 to 2017, the U.S. attorney's office in Boston said in a statement on Tuesday.

            Crater and associates he paid to promote the scheme through social media, email and text messages, said the coins were a fully functioning cryptocurrency backed by gold; that the company had a partnership with MasterCard; and that the currency could be exchanged for government-backed currency or other virtual currencies, none of which was true, prosecutors said.











            The Commodity Futures Trading Commission alleged that My Big Coin was a fraud in January 2018.

            Crater's 55 victims had to delay retirement, lost tuition money, and suffered other financial hardships, Joseph Bonavolonta, head of the FBI's Boston office, said in a statement.

            “Spreading outright lies, Randall Crater defrauded dozens of victims out of more than $7.5 million, convincing them their cryptocurrency investments were backed by gold when in reality their hard-earned money went to funding his lavish lifestyle,” he said.

            A federal jury convicted Crater in July of wire fraud, unlawful monetary transactions, and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. 

            In addition to eight years and four months behind bars, Crater, of Lake Mary, Florida, was sentenced to three years of probation, ordered to forfeit more than $7.5 million, and pay restitution of an amount to be determined.BOSTON (AP) — The founder of a cryptocurrency and virtual payment services company who authorities say cheated dozens of investors out of about $7.5 million, which he used to buy a house, cars, jewelry, and other luxuries, has been sentenced to more than eight years in prison.Randall Crater, 52, founded Las Vegas-based My Big Coin Pay Inc. in 2013, offering virtual payment services through a fraudulent digital currency, My Big Coin, from 2014 to 2017, the U.S. attorney's office in Boston said in a statement on Tuesday.Crater and associates he paid to promote the scheme through social media, email and text messages, said the coins were a fully functioning cryptocurrency backed by gold; that the company had a partnership with MasterCard; and that the currency could be exchanged for government-backed currency or other virtual currencies, none of which was true, prosecutors said.The Commodity Futures Trading Commission alleged that My Big Coin was a fraud in January 2018.Crater's 55 victims had to delay retirement, lost tuition money, and suffered other financial hardships, Joseph Bonavolonta, head of the FBI's Boston office, said in a statement.“Spreading outright lies, Randall Crater defrauded dozens of victims out of more than $7.5 million, convincing them their cryptocurrency investments were backed by gold when in reality their hard-earned money went to funding his lavish lifestyle,” he said.A federal jury convicted Crater in July of wire fraud, unlawful monetary transactions, and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business.In addition to eight years and four months behind bars, Crater, of Lake Mary, Florida, was sentenced to three years of probation, ordered to forfeit more than $7.5 million, and pay restitution of an amount to be determined.",2023/02/01,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797463,Finland ends infertility requirement for transgender people,"HELSINKI (AP) — Lawmakers in Finland approved amendments Wednesday that will make it substantially easier for people to change their legally recognized gender in the Nordic country.

            The amendments, which are expected to take effect as soon as possible, also abolish a provision that required transgender people to provide a medical certificate proving they were infertile or sterilized before the government would recognize their gender identity. That part of the existing law was intended to keep transgender individuals from having children. 

            Finland’s 200-seat parliament, the Eduskunta, voted 113-69 in favor of making the changes, which lawmakers fiercely debated in recent months. 











            The bill allows transgender individuals who are 18 or older in Finland to legally change their genders by self-declaration without having to supply a psychiatric assessment and the certificate on their ability to reproduce. To prevent misuse of the revised law, such requests only can be made once a year. 

            “By passing this act, Finland has taken a major step towards protecting trans people’s rights and improving their lives and right to self-determination,” Matti Pihlajamaa, Amnesty International Finland's LGBTI rights advisor, said in a statement.

            Prime Minister Sanna Marin has earlier said that getting the amendments approved was a priority for her center-left government still during the Cabinet’s remaining two months in office. Finland will hold general election in early April. 

            
                Spain approved legislation allowing gender changes by self-declaration last month, while the British government vetoed a similar bill that lawmakers in Scotland passed in December.HELSINKI (AP) — Lawmakers in Finland approved amendments Wednesday that will make it substantially easier for people to change their legally recognized gender in the Nordic country.The amendments, which are expected to take effect as soon as possible, also abolish a provision that required transgender people to provide a medical certificate proving they were infertile or sterilized before the government would recognize their gender identity.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797467,African state Chad to open embassy in Israel,"JERUSALEM (AP) — Chad will open an embassy in Israel, four years after the countries restored diplomatic relations, Israel's Prime Minister's Office said Wednesday. 

            Benjamin Netanyahu's office said the embassy would be inaugurated on Thursday as part of Chadian President Mahamat Deby’s state visit to Israel. 

            Netanyahu visited the central African state in January 2019 as part of Israel's push to establish diplomatic ties with Muslim states. The following year Israel signed normalization agreements with Morocco, Bahrain, Sudan and the United Arab Emirates as part of the U.S.-brokered “Abraham Accords.” 











            “These are relations we want to upgrade to new levels, to new heights, and your visit here to Israel and opening an embassy are an expression of that,” Netanyahu said during a meeting with Deby. 

            Deby was declared head of state in 2021 after the military announced that his father had been killed by rebels after more than three decades in power. 

            Deby was greeted on the tarmac by Mossad intelligence agency chief David Barnea, the Prime Minister's Office said. 

            Deby’s father and predecessor in office, Idriss Deby, visited Jerusalem in 2018. Chad had relations with Israel until 1972, when it terminated diplomatic ties under pressure from other Arab countries. 

            The desert country is one of the world’s least developed states, according to the World Bank’s Human Development Index, and its government has been accused of widespread human rights abuses and rigged elections.JERUSALEM (AP) — Chad will open an embassy in Israel, four years after the countries restored diplomatic relations, Israel's Prime Minister's Office said Wednesday.Benjamin Netanyahu's office said the embassy would be inaugurated on Thursday as part of Chadian President Mahamat Deby’s state visit to Israel.Netanyahu visited the central African state in January 2019 as part of Israel's push to establish diplomatic ties with Muslim states.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797470,"Pat Riley: Kareem never had potential, 'only greatness'","Pat Riley remembers just about every detail surrounding the events of Dec. 29, 1961. It was a cold night in Schenectady, New York. A little snowy, the roads a little icy. And when the bus carrying the opposing team from New York City arrived, all of Riley’s Linton High teammates peered out the window.

            They saw a giant.

            Long before Riley and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar were winning NBA championships together as coach and player with the Showtime-era Los Angeles Lakers in the 1980s, they were opponents. Riley and Linton beat Power Memorial and Lew Alcindor — Abdul-Jabbar’s name before converting to Islam — 74-68 that night.











            Abdul-Jabbar, then a 6-foot-10 freshman, was held to eight points because he spent virtually the entire game in foul trouble. He has told Riley several times over the years that Linton won because Riley’s father — a lifelong baseball man — had his umpiring friends refereeing the game.

            “Which we did,” Riley acknowledges.

            Riley knew it then and came to appreciate it even more years later — there were only a few ways to stop the player who would eventually spend nearly four decades as the most prolific scorer in NBA history. Abdul-Jabbar was passed Tuesday night atop the scoring list by the Lakers’ LeBron James, the 38-year-old who was nearly nine months from being born when the unforgettable center made one of his signature sky hooks on April 5, 1984 to overtake Wilt Chamberlain and become the league’s scoring leader.

            “Kareem was a guy that never had any potential. He just had greatness,” said Riley, now the president of the Miami Heat and one of the few who has worked with both Abdul-Jabbar and James. “You could see that. When you can bypass potential and you move right to greatness as a high school player, and then college and then the pros ... there are very few like him. There’s a handful. Two handfuls, at the most.”

            James is one of them, going from high school straight to the NBA.

            This past October, Abdul-Jabbar — on his Substack page where he discusses and offers opinion on a variety of topics, often nothing to do with sports — wrote that when James passed Kobe Bryant for No. 3 on the all-time scoring list in 2020, he “knew it was just a matter of time before he passed me too.”

            Abdul-Jabbar added that every time a record is broken, all people are elevated.

            “When I broke Wilt Chamberlain’s scoring record in 1984 — the year LeBron was born — it bothered Wilt, who’d had a bit of a one-sided rivalry with me since I’d started doing so well in the NBA,"" he wrote. ""I don’t feel that way toward LeBron. Not only will I celebrate his accomplishment, I will sing his praises unequivocally.”

            The relationship between Abdul-Jabbar and James seems complicated. Abdul-Jabbar was outside of the Cleveland locker room during the 2016 Eastern Conference finals as James was jogging by; the two embraced and shared a few kind words, prompting James to discuss the respect he has for Abdul-Jabbar and others who paved the way in his postgame remarks.

            Abdul-Jabbar also has lauded James “as a community leader and athlete.” But he criticized James for not doing more with his platform to encourage people to get vaccinated against COVID-19. And earlier this season, James said he has “no relationship” with Abdul-Jabbar.

            There are ties that bind them, though. Both are champions. Both have worked to promote social justice and spoken out against racial inequality. Abdul-Jabbar played 20 years in the NBA; James is in Year 20. Abdul-Jabbar set the record while playing for the Lakers; James did the same.

            And If nothing else, James' pursuit of the record may have exposed a generation or two that never saw Abdul-Jabbar play to how great he was.

            “We have to always acknowledge those who come before us, those who’ve paved the way,” Lakers coach Darvin Ham said. “You think of all those points Kareem scored and he had, what, one 3-pointer? You think about all of that, and these kids get to learn about a different era. It’s high, high-level education in the game of basketball, particularly NBA basketball.”

            When Abdul-Jabbar broke the record, Riley said Magic Johnson — then the Lakers’ point guard — made sure he was the one who got the assist on the play. Johnson nearly put himself back into the game against Utah in Las Vegas that night when Abdul-Jabbar was two points away.

            Years later, when the Lakers from those championship teams of that era gathered in Hawaii last summer for a reunion, Abdul-Jabbar was a day late because of personal matters. The Lakers in 2022 celebrated his arrival the same way they did the record-setter in 1984.

            “He felt special because he was special, because he is special,” Riley said of the man who once stood shoulder-to-shoulder alongside an embattled Muhammad Ali during the boxing champ's legal troubles in the late 1960s, and counted Bill Russell — another basketball giant and social-change champion — as a mentor. “He was treated as the patriarch by all the players. It was a great week for him. He was engaged, came to everything we did, gave some spontaneous talks. And he’s a shy guy, but he felt very comfortable in his group.”

            Riley coached Abdul-Jabbar in Los Angeles and later lured James to Miami for a four-year run starting in 2010. He sees in James much of what he saw in Alcindor when that bus pulled into Schenectady in 1961.

            “It’s all about LeBron right now, and it should be, with his unique career and unique opportunity to do this,” Riley said. “Training, travel, personal chefs, personal trainers, all that stuff has come into play since Kareem. I hope people realize Kareem’s story as well and how different it was. He went to college for four years; LeBron came out of high school. But they both dominated from Day 1. They both turned potential into greatness from Day 1.”

            AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsPat Riley remembers just about every detail surrounding the events of Dec. 29, 1961. It was a cold night in Schenectady, New York. A little snowy, the roads a little icy. And when the bus carrying the opposing team from New York City arrived, all of Riley’s Linton High teammates peered out the window.They saw a giant.Long before Riley and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar were winning NBA championships together as coach and player with the Showtime-era Los Angeles Lakers in the 1980s, they were opponents. Riley and Linton beat Power Memorial and Lew Alcindor — Abdul-Jabbar’s name before converting to Islam — 74-68 that night.Abdul-Jabbar, then a 6-foot-10 freshman, was held to eight points because he spent virtually the entire game in foul trouble. He has told Riley several times over the years that Linton won because Riley’s father — a lifelong baseball man — had his umpiring friends refereeing the game.“Which we did,” Riley acknowledges.Riley knew it then and came to appreciate it even more years later — there were only a few ways to stop the player who would eventually spend nearly four decades as the most prolific scorer in NBA history. Abdul-Jabbar was passed Tuesday night atop the scoring list by the Lakers’ LeBron James, the 38-year-old who was nearly nine months from being born when the unforgettable center made one of his signature sky hooks on April 5, 1984 to overtake Wilt Chamberlain and become the league’s scoring leader.“Kareem was a guy that never had any potential. He just had greatness,” said Riley, now the president of the Miami Heat and one of the few who has worked with both Abdul-Jabbar and James. “You could see that. When you can bypass potential and you move right to greatness as a high school player, and then college and then the pros ... there are very few like him. There’s a handful. Two handfuls, at the most.”James is one of them, going from high school straight to the NBA.This past October, Abdul-Jabbar — on his Substack page where he discusses and offers opinion on a variety of topics, often nothing to do with sports — wrote that when James passed Kobe Bryant for No. 3 on the all-time scoring list in 2020, he “knew it was just a matter of time before he passed me too.”Abdul-Jabbar added that every time a record is broken, all people are elevated.“When I broke Wilt Chamberlain’s scoring record in 1984 — the year LeBron was born — it bothered Wilt, who’d had a bit of a one-sided rivalry with me since I’d started doing so well in the NBA,"" he wrote.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797473,Records: Minor infractions for officers before Nichols case,"MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) — Four of five Memphis officers charged with killing Tyre Nichols after violently beating him had infractions on their records from previous police work.

            Their transgressions were mainly procedural but included using minor physical force during an arrest and failing to fill out a form about it, failing to report a domestic violence situation, and a car crash, records showed.

            Documents obtained by The Associated Press show four of the five Memphis Police Department officers had policy violations on their record before the Jan. 7 arrest, but nothing that rose to the brutality that led to Nichols’ death three days later. Two of the officers were previously suspended for procedural violations of department policy. 











            The five officers — Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley, Emmitt Martin III, Desmond Mills Jr. and Justin Smith — have been fired and charged with second-degree murder, kidnapping and other offenses. Harrowing video of the arrest was released Friday. 

            Records showed Bean was the only officer who did not have previous infractions or penalties in his administrative records. All five were hired between March 2017 and August 2020, and all were members of a crime-suppression unit that was disbanded after Nichols’ death. 

            Two officers, Haley and Mills, received reprimands for failing to file “response to resistance” forms after incidents involving women they arrested, records showed. 

            Such forms are filled out when an officer uses force or physical means to restrain a person deemed to be resisting arrest. In the documents, Memphis police stated that response to resistance included “the use of any part of the officer’s body to compel compliance.”

            Other infractions were related to car accidents and equipment issues.

            Lawyers for Haley, Martin and Mills declined to comment. A lawyer for Smith did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 

            Records showed Haley responded to a shooting on Feb. 21, 2021, “grabbed a complainant by the arm"" and turned her around to be handcuffed as she resisted arrest.

            During an administrative hearing, Haley said he understood the policy but was “simply mistaken” about the amount of force necessary in the situation. He received a written reprimand, records showed. A lieutenant cited in the documents for that case said Haley was a “hard-working officer” who routinely made good decisions.

            Mills also received written reprimand after he “physically assisted” other officers during an arrest March 21, 2019. Mills said in his hearing that he was trying to help other officers to “gain control” of a young woman to handcuff her. Mills said he did not realize he had to fill out a response to resistance form in the case.

            Records also showed Emmitt Martin III “refused to take a report” after responding to a domestic disturbance call involving two sisters. Martin was asked to take a report from the husband of one of the women, but he decided only to “advise all parties,” records showed. He was suspended for one day.

            Martin also was suspended for three days after he left a gun on the rear floor of his car after a shift.

            Smith received a two-day suspension after his police car was involved in a crash with two other vehicles. 

            Two other officers were suspended from the Memphis police force after Nichols’ arrest. Only one, Preston Hemphill, has been identified. It is not immediately known whether he had infractions on his record before the Nichols arrest.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797474,"In Congo, activists look to Pope to boost forest protections","Local climate activists in Congo are hoping Pope Francis' visit will help spur action to protect the country's rainforest from oil and gas interests.

            The Pope's call to protect Congo's “great green lungs of the world” on Tuesday was welcomed by campaigners who see the papal visit as a fresh opportunity to highlight threats to the country's biodiversity and global climate goals. 

            Parts of Congo's rainforest are up for oil and gas auction and several climate activist groups are petitioning the Pope to support their stance opposing fossil fuels investments. 











            The activists plan to present a petition calling for the cancellation of the oil blocks leases to the Pope, who is in Congo until Friday.

            “We appeal to Pope Francis to engage our government on this very crucial matter to call for the stop to these fossil fuel projects and the prioritization of renewable energy,"" said Congolese climate activist Bonaventure Bondo. 

            Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi said Tuesday evening that all projects involving natural resources in the country require “a serious and preliminary study of the environmental impact"" and said it was richer nations responsible for climate change.

            “We have always campaigned for climate justice so the biggest polluters, who are at the root of the destruction of the environment pay compensation to the guardians of the planet that we are,” Tshisekedi said in an address to the Pope.

            The Congo Basin, the world’s largest peatland, is an important carbon sink as it sucks up vast amounts of planet-warming carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Other threatened areas, such as Virunga National Park, are viewed as important biodiversity hotspots.

            On Tuesday Pope Francis condemned the exploitation of the continents resources, saying “Africa is not a mine to be stripped or a terrain to be plundered.”

            Greenpeace Africa’s Mbong Akiy Fokwa Tsafack said the activists' aims were in line with the position of the church. 

            “Human creation has a moral responsibility to take care of nature and not to destroy it ... it is our collective responsibility to reverse nature’s decline,” she said.

            The Laudato Si movement, which encourages those of Catholic faith to be involved in climate action, also voiced concern about oil and gas exploration in Congo. 

            It “sets us on the path of more climate catastrophes,” said the movement's Ashley Kitisya.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797475,"Tanker breaks down in Suez Canal, but traffic not disrupted","CAIRO (AP) — A tanker transporting liquefied natural gas broke down in the Suez Canal on Wednesday but traffic in the global waterway was unaffected, a canal spokesperson said.

            The Bahamas-flagged Grace Emilia suffered a malfunction of its rudder and tugboats pulled it to the side of the canal to allow other vessels to pass, said George Safwat, a spokesperson for Egypt's Suez Canal Authority.

            He told The Associated Press that the north-bound tanker stopped working in the southern part of the canal, where a two-lane waterway enables ships to transit.











            Canal services provider Leth Agencies reported the incident in a Twitter post, saying vessels “can pass in both directions.”

            Safwat, the spokesperson, said 68 vessels transited the canal on Wednesday. He said the canal tugs were towing the Grace Emilia to Great Bitter Lake to repair the malfunction.

            A statement from the vessel's operators said no pollution or injuries had been reported from the incident. It said an underwater inspection, along with an investigation, would be conducted to determine the causes of the breakdown.

            Built in 2021, the Grace Emilia is 297 meters (975 feet) long and 46 meters (151 feet) wide. Its cargo tank capacity is 174,000 cubic meters.

            According to VesselFinder, a vessel tracking service provider, the Grace Emilia sails between the port of Dabhol in India and Cove Point in Maryland.

            
                Last month, a cargo ship carrying corn went aground in the canal before it was refloated to allow the resumption of traffic.

            In March 2021, the Panama-flagged Ever Given, a colossal container ship, crashed into a bank on a single-lane stretch of the canal, blocking the waterway for six days.

            Opened in 1869, the Suez Canal provides a crucial link for oil, natural gas and cargo. About 10% of world trade flows through the canal, a pivotal source of foreign currency to Egypt.

            The Suez Canal Authority said 23,851 vessels passed through the waterway last year, compared to 20,649 vessels in 2021. The canal’s annual revenues reached $8 billion, the highest in its history.CAIRO (AP) — A tanker transporting liquefied natural gas broke down in the Suez Canal on Wednesday but traffic in the global waterway was unaffected, a canal spokesperson said.The Bahamas-flagged Grace Emilia suffered a malfunction of its rudder and tugboats pulled it to the side of the canal to allow other vessels to pass, said George Safwat, a spokesperson for Egypt's Suez Canal Authority.He told The Associated Press that the north-bound tanker stopped working in the southern part of the canal, where a two-lane waterway enables ships to transit.Canal services provider Leth Agencies reported the incident in a Twitter post, saying vessels “can pass in both directions.”Safwat, the spokesperson, said 68 vessels transited the canal on Wednesday.

            The highly anticipated tour announcement she made on Instagram and her website Wednesday comes days before the Grammy Awards on Sunday, where the global superstar is the most nominated artist and could make Recording Academy history. 

            Beyoncé, the most decorated woman in Grammy history with 28 wins, could break the late Hungarian-British conductor Georg Solti’s record for most awards won if she wins four awards.











            Her 2022 album “Renaissance” is a celebration of dance music and is nominated for album of the year. Her tour will make stops in London, Paris, Barcelona and Toronto before ending Sept. 27 in New Orleans.

            There were hints that she might tour again after she performed an invite-only show in January in Dubai at the Atlantis The Royal Resort, her first show in four years. Her last solo tour was in 2016, but she went on tour with her husband Jay Z in 2018.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797488,Czechs to end checks at Slovak border amid migration decline,"PRAGUE (AP) — The Czech Republic's government will end checks on the country's border with Slovakia that were renewed last year amid a new increase in migration, officials said Wednesday.

            
                The measure has been in place since Sept. 29 at 27 border crossings between the two European Union countries, which belong to the visa-free Schengen zone. It was initially supposed to last for 10 days.

            The authorities will stop carrying out the checks on Sunday after more than four months.











            The Czech Interior Ministry argued at the time that the border controls were necessary after authorities detained nearly 12,000 migrants on Czech territory last year, most of them from Syria. That was more than during Europe's migration crisis of 2015.

            Interior Minister Vit Rakusan said that about 400 migrants were detained on a daily basis in September.

            “The numbers have significantly dropped,” Rakusan said Wednesday.

            The ministry said that more than 3 million people have been checked, with 2,545 being denied entry. Around 10,000 migrants and 141 suspected human smugglers were detained.

            The ministry said that the refugees have been using the Czech Republic as a transit country on their way to countries further west.

            Schengen countries have adopted temporary border controls in the past for various reasons, including to curb illegal migration and to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.

            “He gets a bad rap, but at the end of the day, I don’t think anyone can question his athleticism. This guy, I did see, he had a 3-centimeter tear in his hammy,” Tiley said Wednesday in an interview with SEN Sportsday.

            “The doctors are ... going to tell you the truth,” Tiley said. “I think there was a lot of speculation of whether it was true or not. It’s hard to believe that someone can do what they do with those types of injuries. But he’s remarkable.”











            Djokovic won the trophy at Melbourne Park on Sunday by beating Stefanos Tsitsipas in straight sets for a record-extending 10th title there and record-tying 22nd Grand Slam trophy overall. Rafael Nadal is the only other man who has won that many majors.

            The triumph also allowed Djokovic to return to No. 1 in the ATP rankings on Monday.

            The 35-year-old from Serbia hurt his hamstring during a tune-up tournament in Adelaide ahead of the Australian Open. He wore a heavy bandage on his left thigh and was visited by trainers during matches in Week 1 in Melbourne.

            He said he took “a lot” of painkiller pills and did various treatments to help the leg.

            “Let me put it like this: I don’t say 100%, but 97% of the players, on Saturday when you get results of the MRI, you go straight to the referee's office and pull out of the tournament,” Djokovic's coach, Goran Ivanisevic, said after the final. “But not him. ...

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797491,Money Mexican migrants send home up 13.4% in 2022,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — The money that Mexican migrants send home to their relatives grew by 13.4% in 2022, totaling about $58.5 billion for the year as a whole, Mexico’s central bank said Wednesday.

            While that is a record amount for migrant remittances to Mexico, it represents a slowing of growth. In 2021, remittances grew by an astounding 27.1%, totaling about $51.6 billion for the year.

            Observers say the lower rate of increase may be due to slower economic growth in the United States — where most Mexican migrants work — and higher inflation and a stronger Mexican peso. 











            Remittances now surpass almost all other sources of the country’s foreign income, including tourism, oil exports and most manufacturing exports.

            Mexico receives more money from remittances than any other country except India. Indian migrants send home about $100 billion each year. China's share of remittances was affected by the coronavirus pandemic.

            Still, no one is getting rich in Mexico from remittances; the average amount each migrant sent was $391, according to the Bank of Mexico.

            BBVA Research said in a report that remittances sent to Mexico have grown for 31 straight months, a run that started in May 2020, around the time the pandemic began hitting in Mexico.

            The bank said “in 2023, it is estimated that remittances will continue to grow, but at a slower rate, due to a possible scenario of slower world economic growth.”

            Remittances as a percentage of Mexico’s GDP have almost doubled over the past decade, growing from 2% of GDP in 2010 to 3.8% in 2020, according to the government. Between 2010 and 2020, the percentage of households in Mexico receiving remittances rose from 3.6% to 5.1%.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797492,Regional heads plan joint push against al-Shabab in Somalia,"MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) — The leaders of Somalia, Djibouti, Ethiopia and Kenya have agreed on a joint “search and destroy” military campaign against the Somali al-Shabab Islamic militant group that has carried out attacks in the region — including firing mortars near the meeting venue in Mogadishu before officials gathered Wednesday.

            In a joint communique issued after the meeting in Somalia's capital, the four heads of state said the operation would “prevent any future infiltrating elements into the wider region.”

            “The Summit agreed to make the final push for joint operations in the areas that remain under the terrorists to completely liberate the whole of Somalia from Al-Shabab,” read Wednesday's communique from the four countries — whose soldiers are part of the Africa Union peacekeeping mission in Somalia.











            Somalia’s government is currently running what has been described as the most significant offensive against the al-Shabab extremist group in more than a decade.

            Al-Shabab’s thousands of fighters have held back the nation’s recovery from decades of conflict by carrying out brazen attacks in Mogadishu and elsewhere.

            Streets of Mogadishu which regularly face attacks were on Wednesday shut down with limited movement amid strong military patrols, and all commercial flights were suspended while the heads of state visited.

            Even then, witnesses reported that mortar shells landed near the presidential place before the meetings kicked off, but no fatalities were reported. Al-Shabab claimed responsibility for the attack.

            Somalia’s President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud said the meeting “reaffirms our resolve to rid our region of terrorism permanently.”

            Kenya’s President William Ruto said that peace was within reach due to the “collective effort in anti-terrorism.”

            The regional leaders have decided to establish a joint operations mechanism that will coordinate the drive to defeat al-Shabab.

            A Western humanitarian official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, said more territory has been taken from al-Shabab in the past six months than in the past five years, with close to 100 villages recaptured from the extremists.

            “It took us all by surprise because it was very organic,” the official said, with local communities rising up in revolt against al-Shabab’s harsh taxation amid Somalia’s worst drought on record. Somalia’s government quickly supported the local militia fighters in the offensive.

            While Somalia’s government vows to eliminate al-Shabab, some observers see that as a daunting task. “Al-Shabab has proven it can be effective without holding territory,” the humanitarian official said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797493,Brady's unprecedented career filled with highlight moments,"Nobody drove Tom Brady harder than the record-setting quarterback himself, even if his 23rd and final season after a brief retirement didn't end with him lifting yet another Lombardi Trophy.

            He leaves the NFL with more wins, yards passing and touchdowns than any other quarterback. He even set a pair of single-season passing records at the age of 45. And yes, nobody has more Super Bowl rings than Brady with seven.

            Brady competed so hard that he pulled his teammates along with him.











            Tampa Bay center Ryan Jensen, the nine-year pro who hurt his left knee on the second day of training camp, came off injured reserve to snap to Brady in the Buccaneers' wild-card loss to Dallas — the quarterback's final game.

            “Thanks for pushing me everyday this season mentally and physically to get back on the field,"" Jensen wrote on social media Wednesday. “I’m glad I was able to take the field with you one last time! Enjoy retirement, don’t dog me too much in the booth. Love ya man!”

            Brady did more than his part to fill the video vaults at NFL Films. Here are just a few of his greatest moments:

            FINAL FINAL SEASON

            Brady didn't finish his career with a winning record in his last season. He did, however, make his mark.

            He set a pair of NFL single-season records, completing 490 passes on 733 attempts, and wound up ranking third in the NFL with 4,694 yards passing. And yes, he led the Bucs to a second straight NFC South title even with a losing record.

            SUPER BOWL COMEBACK

            Of course, the first Super Bowl decided in overtime featured Brady leading one of the greatest comebacks in sports history.

            Trailing Atlanta 28-3 in the third quarter, Brady threw two TDs and then drove the Patriots 91 yards by completing six passes to set up the tying score inside the final minute. Once New England won the coin toss, Brady completed his first five passes as the Patriots won 34-28 for their fifth Super Bowl on Feb. 7, 2017.

            OVERTIME DRIVE FOR SUPER BOWL

            Already the oldest quarterback to play in a Super Bowl, Brady outdueled the NFL’s young MVP in Patrick Mahomes in Kansas City on Jan. 20, 2019, with another Super Bowl berth on the line. Brady answered each big drive by Mahomes, especially in a thrilling fourth quarter in which the lead was swapped four times.

            Once the Chiefs forced overtime, Brady took over after the Patriots won the coin toss. He converted on a trio of third-and-10s with a pair of passes to Julian Edelman and a third to Rob Gronkowsk to set up the clinching TD run by Rex Burkhead.

            SEVENTH RING

            Even coming close to Brady’s record in Super Bowls will be very challenging after he won No. 7 in his first season in Tampa Bay. He threw two touchdowns to Gronkowski and a third to Antonio Brown as the Bucs routed Mahomes and the Chiefs 31-9.

            And yes, Brady helped the Bucs become the first franchise ever to win the Super Bowl on its home field.

            GIVE HIM SIX

            Brady helped the Patriots put an end to Tebowmania in spectacular fashion. Brady tied a playoff record set first by Daryle Lamonica, then matched by Steve Young by throwing six TD passes in a divisional game against Tim Tebow and the Denver Broncos on Jan. 14, 2012.

            He threw the first within the first two minutes to Wes Welker and wound up with all six in the Patriots’ first nine drives. Brady threw three passes to Gronkowski. And two of Brady’s six TDs came in the final two minutes of the first half.

            Brady finished with 363 yards passing in the Patriots’ 45-10 victory.

            HEY PEYTON

            Brady dominated his rivalry with five-time NFL MVP Peyton Manning, winning 11 of their 17 meetings and their first playoff showdown.

            With the Patriots and Colts facing off in the AFC championship game on Brady’s home turf on Jan. 18, 2004, Brady set the tone from the start. He capped an opening drive with a TD pass to David Givens and had the Patriots up 15-0 at halftime on the way to a 24-14 victory and another Super Bowl berth.

            TUCK RULE

            Brady gave a preview of postseason success to come on Jan. 19, 2002, in his only playoff game at old Foxboro Stadium, with a big assist from a replay review.

            Trailing the Oakland Raiders 13-10 with 1:50 left, former Michigan teammate Charles Woodson knocked the ball out of Brady’s hand. The Raiders recovered the fumble and celebrated only to have the call reversed on replay by referee Walt Coleman because of the little-known Tuck Rule. The rule was later eliminated.

            Brady found David Patten on the next play for a 13-yard pass, setting up Adam Vinatieri’s tying field goal. In overtime, Brady completed eight straight passes to position Vinatieri for the winning field goal that launched Brady and the Patriots on the way to their first Super Bowl title.

            AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFLNobody drove Tom Brady harder than the record-setting quarterback himself, even if his 23rd and final season after a brief retirement didn't end with him lifting yet another Lombardi Trophy.He leaves the NFL with more wins, yards passing and touchdowns than any other quarterback. He even set a pair of single-season passing records at the age of 45. And yes, nobody has more Super Bowl rings than Brady with seven.Brady competed so hard that he pulled his teammates along with him.Tampa Bay center Ryan Jensen, the nine-year pro who hurt his left knee on the second day of training camp, came off injured reserve to snap to Brady in the Buccaneers' wild-card loss to Dallas — the quarterback's final game.“Thanks for pushing me everyday this season mentally and physically to get back on the field,"" Jensen wrote on social media Wednesday. “I’m glad I was able to take the field with you one last time! Enjoy retirement, don’t dog me too much in the booth. Love ya man!”Brady did more than his part to fill the video vaults at NFL Films. Here are just a few of his greatest moments:FINAL FINAL SEASONBrady didn't finish his career with a winning record in his last season. He did, however, make his mark.He set a pair of NFL single-season records, completing 490 passes on 733 attempts, and wound up ranking third in the NFL with 4,694 yards passing. And yes, he led the Bucs to a second straight NFC South title even with a losing record.SUPER BOWL COMEBACKOf course, the first Super Bowl decided in overtime featured Brady leading one of the greatest comebacks in sports history.Trailing Atlanta 28-3 in the third quarter, Brady threw two TDs and then drove the Patriots 91 yards by completing six passes to set up the tying score inside the final minute.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797494,How to make a mummy: Ancient Egyptian workshop has new clues,"NEW YORK (AP) — For thousands of years, ancient Egyptians mummified their dead in the search for eternal life. Now, researchers have used chemistry and an unusual collection of jars to figure out how they did it.

            Their study, published Wednesday in the journal Nature, is based on a rare archaeological find: An embalming workshop with a trove of pottery around 2,500 years old. Many jars from the site were still inscribed with instructions like “to wash” or “to put on his head.”

            By matching the writing on the outside of the vessels with the chemical traces inside, researchers uncovered new details about the “recipes” that helped preserve bodies for thousands of years.











            “It’s like a time machine, really,” said Joann Fletcher, an archaeologist at University of York who was not involved with the study. “It’s allowed us to not quite see over the shoulders of the ancient embalmers, but probably as close as we’ll ever get.”

            Those recipes showed that embalmers had deep knowledge about what substances would help preserve their dead, said Fletcher, whose partner was a co-author on the study. And they included materials from far-flung parts of the world — meaning Egyptians went to great lengths to make their mummies “as perfect as they could possibly be.”

            The workshop — uncovered in 2016 by study author Ramadan Hussein, who passed away last year — is located in the famous burial grounds of Saqqara. Parts of it sit above the surface, but a shaft stretches down to an embalming room and burial chamber underground, where the jars were discovered.

            It was in rooms like these where the last phase of the process took place, said Salima Ikram, an Egyptologist at The American University in Cairo who was not involved with the study. After drying out the the body with salts, which probably took place above ground, embalmers would then take the bodies below. 

            “This was the last phase of your transformation where the secret rites, the religious rites, were being performed,” Ikram said. “People would be chanting spells and hymns while you were being wrapped and resin was being anointed all over your body.”

            Experts already had some clues about what substances were used in those final steps, mainly from testing individual mummies and looking at written texts. But a lot of gaps remained, said senior author Philipp Stockhammer, an archaeologist at Ludwig Maximilian University in Germany.

            The new finds helped crack the case. 

            Take the word “antiu,” which shows up in a lot of Egyptian texts but didn't have a direct translation, Stockhammer said. In the new study, scientists found that several jars labeled as “antiu” contained a mixture of different substances — including animal fat, cedar oil and juniper resin.

            These substances, along with others found in the jars, have key properties that would help preserve the mummies, said lead author Maxime Rageot, an archaeologist at Germany’s University of Tubingen. 

            Plant oils — which were used to protect the liver and treat the bandages — could ward off bacteria and fungi, while also improving the smell. Hard materials like beeswax, used on the stomach and skin, could help keep out water and seal the pores. 

            Some of the substances came from very far away — like dammar and elemi, types of resin that come from the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. These results show that ancient Egyptians would trade far and wide to get the most effective materials, the authors said.

            “It’s interesting to see the complexity,” Stockhammer said. “Having this global network on the one hand, having all this chemical knowledge on the other side.”

            Ikram said an important next step for the research will be to test different parts of actual mummies to see if the same substances show up. And these recipes probably weren't universal — they changed over time and varied between workshops.

            Still, the study gives a basis for understanding the past, and can bring us closer to people who lived long ago, she said.

            “The ancient Egyptians have been separated from us through time and space, yet we still have this connection,"" Ikram said. ""Human beings all throughout history have been scared of death.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797495,Putin foe Navalny says he's in solitary cell for 6 months,"MOSCOW (AP) — Imprisoned Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny said in a social media post published Wednesday that prison authorities have placed him in a one-person cell for six months, a move his lawyer described as part of authorities' efforts to damage Navalny's health.

            Navalny, 46, said on Instagram that he had been denied the opportunity to visit with his family for the past eight months. The move to solitary confinement means he will not see his wife and children for another half a year, he said. 

            “Even maniacs and serial killers serving life sentences have the right for meetings, but I do not,” he said. “When such thing happens to you, you understand even more acutely how important it is to fight this unscrupulous government, how important it is to do at least something to free Russia from the yoke of these scoundrels from Russia and dispel the dope with which they have enveloped the heads of millions.”











            Navalny, who exposed official corruption and organized massive anti-Kremlin protests, is serving a nine-year fraud sentence in a maximum-security prison 250 kilometers (150 miles) east of Moscow.

            He was arrested in January 2021 upon returning from Germany, where he recuperated from nerve-agent poisoning that he blamed on the Kremlin. He was given a 2 1/2-year sentence for a parole violation and last year was sentenced to nine years for fraud and contempt of court. 

            Navalny rejects the charges as a political vendettas and an attempt by Russian authorities to keep him behind bars and out of politics for as long as possible. His supporters say his prosecution was intended to silence Russian President Vladimir Putin's most prominent foe. 

            His lawyer, Vadim Kobzev, alleged that prison authorities deliberately placed an ill inmate in the same cell as Navalny to infect him with a flu and then treated him with antibiotics, resulting in stomach problems and weight loss. 

            Kobzev described the decision to put Navalny in solitary confinement for six months as part of an “explicit strategy to destroy Navalny's health using all means,” adding that prison authorities could only have made the move with Kremlin approval.

            In recent months, Navalny was put in a tiny one-man cell, also called a “punishment cell,"" for purported disciplinary violations such as his alleged failure to properly button his prison robe or to wash his face at a specified time. Navalny's supporters have accused prison authorities of failing to provide him with proper medical assistance, using blindingly bright light in his cell and placing him next to a mentally unstable person. 

            Last week, his supporters erected a replica of Navalny's “punishment cell” outside the Russian Embassy in Berlin to raise awareness of his fate.MOSCOW (AP) — Imprisoned Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny said in a social media post published Wednesday that prison authorities have placed him in a one-person cell for six months, a move his lawyer described as part of authorities' efforts to damage Navalny's health.Navalny, 46, said on Instagram that he had been denied the opportunity to visit with his family for the past eight months.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797496,AMC exits Saudi Arabia as young cinema market booms,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — AMC Entertainment Holdings has decided to exit Saudi Arabia's fast-growing market amid heavy competition less than five years after the lifting of a decades-long ban on movie theaters.

            The world's biggest cinema chain, which announced the decision on Tuesday, said it had always planned to eventually hand operations over to its Saudi partners and that the $30 million sale would further boost its cash reserves as the industry struggles to recover from the pandemic. 

            Saudi Arabia lifted the ban on movie theaters and other forms of public entertainment as part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's efforts to overhaul the economy and bring Western-style entertainment to the once-cloistered and ultra-conservative kingdom.











            AMC marked its arrival by hosting a viewing of “Black Panther” in April 2018 that attracted a large crowd of men and women, a scene that would have been unimaginable just a few years earlier.

            But in the years since it has faced stiff competition, including from homegrown operator muvi Cinemas, which now leads the market, and Vox Cinemas, part of the Dubai-based Majid Al Futtaim Entertainment conglomerate.

            AMC will sell its investment to Saudi Entertainment Ventures, known as SEVEN, which is operated by the Saudi government's Public Investment Fund. 

            The Leawood, Kansas-based company will continue to license the AMC name for the 13 theaters it opened around the kingdom and for future locations. It had initially planned to open up to 40 cinemas by 2023 but scaled back in the face of the pandemic.

            “Our plan all along was to transition our now 13 Middle East theatres to local management, after we trained them and opened beautiful theatres. They still will operate as AMC Cinemas,” AMC Chairman and CEO Adam Aron tweeted. 

            “Plus we sold our 10% stake for $30 million, continuing to build our cash reserves. Cash is king!”

            AMC, which operates some 950 theaters and 10,500 screens around the world, was hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic and the various lockdowns.

            Saudi Arabia's crown prince, with the support of his father, King Salman, has moved to open the kingdom to foreign investors and tourists, hoping to build up the private sector and reduce the country's reliance on its vast oil reserves. Recent years have brought concerts, raves and major sporting events to the kingdom, where more than half the local population is under the age of 25.

            Those plans have proceeded despite the global outcry over the 2018 killing of Saudi dissident and Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, which U.S. intelligence concluded was likely ordered by the crown prince. Saudi authorities say the agents who killed Khashoggi acted on their own and have been tried and sentenced to lengthy prison terms.DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — AMC Entertainment Holdings has decided to exit Saudi Arabia's fast-growing market amid heavy competition less than five years after the lifting of a decades-long ban on movie theaters.The world's biggest cinema chain, which announced the decision on Tuesday, said it had always planned to eventually hand operations over to its Saudi partners and that the $30 million sale would further boost its cash reserves as the industry struggles to recover from the pandemic.Saudi Arabia lifted the ban on movie theaters and other forms of public entertainment as part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's efforts to overhaul the economy and bring Western-style entertainment to the once-cloistered and ultra-conservative kingdom.AMC marked its arrival by hosting a viewing of “Black Panther” in April 2018 that attracted a large crowd of men and women, a scene that would have been unimaginable just a few years earlier.But in the years since it has faced stiff competition, including from homegrown operator muvi Cinemas, which now leads the market, and Vox Cinemas, part of the Dubai-based Majid Al Futtaim Entertainment conglomerate.AMC will sell its investment to Saudi Entertainment Ventures, known as SEVEN, which is operated by the Saudi government's Public Investment Fund.The Leawood, Kansas-based company will continue to license the AMC name for the 13 theaters it opened around the kingdom and for future locations.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797497,Ukraine hails French gift of radar as 'cherry on the cake',"LIMOURS, France (AP) — Ukraine's defense minister said Wednesday that Ukrainian lives will be saved by a sophisticated air-defense radar that France is supplying and which is powerful enough to spot incoming missiles and exploding drones in the skies over all of Ukraine's capital and its surrounding region.

            The minister, Oleksii Reznikov, was so enthusiastic about what he called Ukraine's new “electronic eyes” that he quickly coined a nickname for the Ground Master 200 radar — the “Grand Master."" 

            Speaking through an interpreter at a handover ceremony for the radar with his French counterpart, Reznikov described the French-made GM200 as a ""very effective” improvement for Ukraine's network of about 300 different types of air-defense radars. 











            Thales, the manufacturer, says the radar detects and tracks rockets, artillery and mortar shells, missiles, aircraft, drones and other threats. 

            “Because of your support, Ukrainian lives will be saved,” the minister said at the ceremony in Limours, where Thales makes the equipment.

            “This radar will be the cherry on the cake,"" he added. “That's why it will be called ‘Grand Master.’"" 

            The French defense minister, Sebastien Lecornu, said the GM200's range of 250 kilometers (155 miles) would enable it to watch the skies over Kyiv and the Ukrainian capital's surrounding region, although it wasn't clear whether that's where Ukrainian forces intend to deploy it. 

            The radar is transportable on a truck. Thales says it can be deployed in 15 minutes and be moved to another location in 10 minutes, making it a harder target to hit.

            The minister was gifted a small model of the radar at the ceremony and brandished it with a big grin above his head.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797498,Key questions after Chelsea's unprecedented spending spree,"Chelsea ripped up soccer's traditional transfer rule book by embarking on a one-of-a-kind spending spree over the past two windows that broke records and completely distorted the market.

            Sixteen players signed. A total spend of $630 million. An innovative way of covering the huge costs to comply with financial rules.

            To say the English club's new American ownership has made its presence felt in its first year in the world of soccer would be an understatement.











            But, in an effort to remodel the squad in realistically the shortest possible timeframe, have Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital delivered a masterstroke or will their cute plan ultimately unravel and prove reckless?

            Here are the figures: Chelsea spent an unprecedented $280 million on new players in Europe's summer transfer window, the first in the post-Roman Abramovich era. Then, in January, the club splashed out an estimated $350 million on eight more players, headlined by the purchase — minutes before the window closed — of Argentina midfielder Enzo Fernandez for a British-record fee of 106.7 million pounds ($131.4 million).

            
                Premier League clubs spent a record $1 billion during the January window, 90% more than the previous high from 2018 and almost triple the amount last year, according to soccer finance expert Deloitte. Chelsea accounted for 37% of the total league spend.

            Chelsea's staggering outlay leaves a number of lingering questions, however.

            HOW CAN CHELSEA AFFORD IT?

            Chelsea is one of the world’s wealthiest clubs ranking No. 8 in the Deloitte Football Money League. Revenue was 568.3 million euros ($620 million) last season. This season, Chelsea gets its usual share of Premier League broadcast rights though potentially less prize money based on its current position of 10th place. The 2021 Champions League winner should earn upward of 80 million euros ($87 million) from this season’s competition. Chelsea plays Borussia Dortmund in the round of 16. Chelsea’s finances are monitored by the Premier League and UEFA to comply with rules drafted to help ensure spending is in line with legitimate income. By giving players contracts of seven or eight years, Chelsea has basically gamed the system by spreading “amortization” costs of transfer fees across the whole deal. UEFA plans to close this loophole. 

            CAN THEY DO IT AGAIN IN THE NEXT WINDOW?

            Unlikely, and an aggressive sale of excess players is probable. More need to follow Jorginho, Timo Werner and Emerson Palmieri leaving Stamford Bridge. UEFA’s updated monitoring rules — no longer called “financial fair play” — kick in next season when clubs should limit their “squad cost” of transfers and wages to 90% of income. It drops to 70% in the 2025-26 season. Still, UEFA lets clubs make losses up to 60 million euros ($65 million) over three years with an extra 10 million euros ($10.9 million) per year for those in “good financial health.” And Boehly is a wealthy investor in sports and entertainment. UEFA sanctions also rarely deter the wealthiest and most influential clubs. Chelsea will hit trouble by failing to qualify for a UEFA-run European competition next season. That is now a real risk of income dropping by 100 million euros ($109 million).

            HOW DOES THE SQUAD LOOK NOW?

            Bloated but very strong. Chelsea has some of the world's most sought-after young players — particularly Fernandez and Ukraine winger Mykhailo Mudryk, who are both 22 — and so much depth in many departments. The spending appeared rather scattergun, though, with the squad now containing five players who prefer to play off the left wing — Mudryk, January loan signing Joao Felix, summer signings Raheem Sterling and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, and Christian Pulisic — but being light on senior strikers, where Kai Havertz is now backed up by Armado Broja and a January recruit from the Norwegian league, David Datro Fofana. Fernandez might be the most important signing, given Chelsea's issues in midfield with N'Golo Kante injured and Jorginho allowed to leave for Arsenal.

            WHICH PLAYERS ARE VULNERABLE?

            Pulisic, the star player in U.S. soccer, must be concerned about his future given the competition for his spot. Similarly, Sterling — one of the big names of the English game — is far from guaranteed starts in the attack. And what about Hakim Ziyech, the Morocco winger who appeared to be leaving for Paris Saint-Germain on deadline day only for paperwork issues to scupper the deal? The 31-year-old Kante might leave in the offseason while Kalidou Koulibaly is probably the fourth-choice center back after arriving last year as one of the marquee signings. And spare a thought for the youngsters in Chelsea's renowned academy, whose pathway to the senior team has become harder to find following the arrival of so many signings. 

            HOW HARD IS THE MANAGER'S JOB NOW?

            Graham Potter knew he was walking into a huge job when he left the cosy environs of Brighton to join Chelsea for his first shot at big-time management. Even he mightn't have comprehended the size of the challenge he would face. Chelsea is already out of both domestic cups and sits in 10th place in the Premier League — 10 points off the top four, leaving qualification for the Champions League unlikely. The best route for returning to Europe's top tournament might be by winning it this season, and Chelsea has a round-of-16 matchup with Borussia Dortmund to come. Considering the amount of arrivals, Potter likely doesn't know his best team and now has a stacked squad to satisfy — with no domestic cup games to give fringe players any time of the field. Expect to see a lot of disgruntled-looking stars on the Chelsea bench in the coming weeks.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797500,EU unveils green industrial plan to counter US spending spree,"The European Union's top official laid out plans on Wednesday to offset a US domestic green tech spending spree, and ensure the bloc gets its slice of a globally burgeoning industry, expected by the International Energy Agency to more than triple in worth by 2030 to $650 billion (€596 billion).In her ""Green Industrial Plan,"" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen set out a four-pronged approach focused on streamlined regulation, relaxed state aid rules, worker skills, and using trade agreements to ensure critical raw material supply.""We are living now in a decisive time, basically the decade that will decide on whether we are going to be successful in fighting climate change or not,"" von der Leyen told reporters in Brussels. Industries that supported EU goals of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 were key to this fight, she stressed.A notable absence — at least in the short term — is the prospect of a fresh cash. Von der Leyen said existing EU money, mainly from the bloc's pandemic recovery fund, could be redirected to serve green industry, but stayed clear of the touchy question of new joint EU borrowing.The EU industrial plan comes in response to the United States' Inflation Reduction Act — a $369-billion package that raised hackles in Europe when unveiled by President Joe Biden last year.EU officials and leaders warned at the time of unfair subsidization, particularly for US-made electric vehicles, that could see EU businesses disadvantaged, or even encourage firms to base themselves stateside to benefit from planned tax credits, for example.On Wednesday, von der Leyen struck a conciliatory tone concerning other countries' investment plans. ""We welcome this. This is good news,"" she said, pointing also to initiatives in Japan, India, the United Kingdom and Canada. ""The fight against climate change is a must. However, it is important to ensure balanced competition, both globally and within the EU,"" von der Leyen added.The plan, which is not yet a formal legal proposal, will be debated by EU leaders at a summit next week. The 27 national governments must give the initiative their seal of approval.Though still only a broad outline, Wednesday's announcement was hotly anticipated by observers fearing an international subsidy race, but also within the EU because of a brewing showdown over skewed state aid and the prospect of shared EU debt.A key tenet of the industrial plan is to extend the application of relaxed state aid rules to aid climate-friendly projects not currently covered — renewable technologies, renewable hydrogen and biofuel storage, for example, according to press material from the Commission.The EU already relaxed its state aid rules in response to the COVID-19 pandemic starting 2020, and then again last year after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But loosening up state aid rules is controversial because more prosperous states, particularly Germany and France, can afford to help their companies the most. Of €672 billion ($733 billion) granted under the temporary crisis framework in 2022, 77% went to Berlin and Paris combined.In the interest of fairness to smaller member states, the European Commission previously seemed poised to propose a fund derived from fresh joint EU borrowing. But seven fiscally conservative member states, led by the Netherlands, made their opposition clear in recent weeks.Jacob Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund in Brussels believes it would be very difficult to get new money on the table given the political sensitivity.""But that may not be such a big problem because quite frankly, we still have quite a lot of firepower in the pandemic recovery fund,” Kirkegaard told DW.This €872 billion pot already includes €250 billion for green measures, including investments supporting the decarbonization of industry, the Commission press material from Wednesday stated.To keep the EU's edge in the long term, Brussels said it would propose by mid-2023  a new European Sovereignty Fund targeting critical and emerging technologies for green industry.It will also set out a so-called Net-Zero Industry Act, with a ""simplified regulatory framework for production capacity of products that are key to meet our climate neutrality goals,"" including batteries, windmills, heat pumps, solar, electrolyzsers, carbon capture and storage technologies.In addition, a Critical Raw Materials Act due to be published next month should support diversified supply of strategically important materials like lithium, used for batteries. This should give EU companies clarity about future supply.Within the EU, there is a real risk of market distortion if state aid relaxation is not matched by funding for smaller states to invest too, Kirkegaard warned. This can be repurposed EU money, as von der Leyen proposed, but it needs to be on the table, he said.When it comes to deciding which companies benefit from funds, Kirkegaard believes the European Commission should be firm in not letting Germany and France get away with too much. ""It needs to be a firmly narrow list of companies that is agreed among all member states,"" he told DW.In terms of the risk of an international subsidy race, Kirkegaard cautions Europeans not to be too drawn into the narrative that Biden's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) will trigger job relocation. ""There's nothing that Joe Biden and the US government, in my opinion, has done that's going to see European jobs shifted to the United States,"" he said.Less sanguine about the IRA is Bernd Lange, the head of European Parliament's Trade Committee. The IRA breaks World Trade Organization rules and is deliberately tempting over European industry, the German conservative poltician told DW.""I know that some states in the United States are advertising quite actively in this field of green technology,"" he said, adding: ""So saying, we have now the IRA, we have low bureaucratic burden and we have low energy prices, come to us.""While the US bill is protectionist, in Kirkegaard's view,  he said the key was for Brussels to ""remain calm.""""We want the United States to embrace also the green transition. And we should be less concerned, quite frankly, that our own green transition is put at risk,"" he said.Edited by. Uwe Hessler",2023/02/01,,

            Russian arms dealer Igor Zimenkov, his son and companies connected to “the Zimenkov network” in Singapore, Cyprus, Bulgaria and Israel, among other countries, were identified by the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control for financial penalties. 

            Roughly 22 people and organizations related to a sanctions evasion network supporting Russia’s military-industrial complex were named in Wednesday's news release.











            The administration uses an April 2021 executive order as its authority to impose the financial penalties, and took the actions in concert with the Russian Elites, Proxies, and Oligarchs Task Force, a multi-agency group that works with other countries to investigate and prosecute oligarchs and others allied with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

            “Russia’s desperate attempts to utilize proxies to circumvent U.S. sanctions demonstrate that sanctions have made it much harder and costlier for Russia’s military-industrial complex to resupply Putin’s war machine,” Treasury's Deputy Secretary Wally Adeyemo said in a Wednesday statement.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797505,Israeli jets strike what army says is Gaza rocket workshop,"TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli aircraft struck a rocket production workshop in the Gaza Strip early Thursday, the Israeli military said, hours after Palestinian militants fired a rocket toward Israel.

            The exchange further raised tensions during a particularly violent period in the long-running Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

            The Israeli military said the workshop contained chemicals and was run by the militant Hamas group, which controls Gaza. 











            Late Wednesday, Israeli air defenses intercepted a rocket from Gaza, the army said. 

            There were no reports of casualties from the rocket or the airstrike.

            Last week, Gaza militants and Israel broke months of cross-border calm by exchanging rockets and airstrikes after Israel killed 10 Palestinians, most of them militants, in a military operation in the West Bank refugee camp of Jenin.

            The latest friction point appeared to be over Palestinian prisoners held by Israel on security charges. Israel's National Security Minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, an ultra-nationalist and a senior member of the most right-wing government in Israel's history, has pledged even tougher treatment of the prisoners in recent days.

            Ben-Gvir said rockets from Gaza won’t stop him from implementing punitive policies against the prisoners. He called for an urgent Security Cabinet meeting to discuss the issue. 

            In Palestinian society, prisoners are generally revered as heroes, with virtually every Palestinian family having had members jailed by Israel on security charges over the course of the decades-long conflict. Several thousand are locked up at any given time, with charges ranging from stone-throwing to deadly attacks on Israelis.

            In a statement Tuesday, Hamas condemned what it said were assaults by Israeli prison guards against Palestinian detainees, particularly female prisoners.

            The Israeli Prison Service said the problems started Friday when it placed dozens of Palestinian prisoners in solitary confinement after they celebrated a Palestinian attack outside a synagogue in east Jerusalem in which seven people were killed. 

            A female Palestinian detainee tried to set fire to her cell in protest, the prison service said. In an unrelated move, the prison service removed televisions from three cells in Israel’s Ofer Prison near the city of Ramallah.

            Amani Srahneh from the Palestinian Prisoners Club, a group representing former and current prisoners, said the “escalatory measures and this new Israeli government’s policy of inciting against prisoners” was creating a tense situation.

            Israeli-Palestinian violence has spiked in recent days as U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited with a call for calm. 

            Last week's army raid in the Jenin camp was followed by the shooting attack near the Jerusalem synagogue on Friday and another Jerusalem shooting in which a 13-year-old Palestinian wounded two Israelis.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797506,The legal woes of former South African president Jacob Zuma,"CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — The judge presiding over former South African President Jacob Zuma's corruption trial recused himself from the case this week, saying he didn't want there to be any chance that the proceedings could be viewed as biased against Zuma.

            It is the latest twist in just one of multiple legal battles involving the 80-year-old former South African leader, who resigned in 2018 amid mounting allegations of corruption but has retained political influence.

            Here is a look at the court cases involving Zuma and how they are impacting politics in Africa's most developed economy.











            CORRUPTION TRIAL

            
                Zuma was charged in 2021 with multiple counts of corruption over a multibillion-dollar arms deal that South Africa signed in 1999 with French company Thales, then known as Thomson-CSF. He is accused of taking hundreds of bribes to help Thales get the deal and faces at least 15 years in jail.

            Zuma is alleged to have taken the bribes while he was a political figure on the rise in the late 1990s and 2000s, although before he became president in 2009. 

            Zuma was first implicated 20 years ago but charges against him were dropped and reinstated numerous times amid allegations of political interference. His corruption trial officially began nearly two years ago but no evidence has yet been heard as Zuma has launched a series of legal challenges.

            One of those is an attempt to get the chief prosecutor removed because Zuma claims he is biased. Because Judge Piet Koen expressed doubts over the validity of Zuma's claim, he has removed himself and allowed another judge to oversee the trial.

            Zuma is also taking separate legal action against the prosecutor and a journalist for allegedly leaking his confidential medical records.

            IMPROPER PAROLE?

            Zuma is fighting to stay out of jail in a second case related to corruption. The former president was convicted of contempt of court in 2021 for refusing to answer questions under oath at an inquiry into allegations of extensive government graft during his time as president, and sentenced to 15 months.

            His jailing sparked violent riots in parts of South Africa that left more than 300 people dead, underlining the sway he still holds in some areas. He was freed on medical parole two months later, but his release came under scrutiny when it was revealed his parole was approved by the head of the corrections department, Arthur Fraser, despite a parole committee rejecting it. Fraser is believed to be close to Zuma and served as the state security agency boss when Zuma was president. 

            Two courts have ruled that Zuma should return to prison and serve the remainder of his sentence. He is appealing that to South Africa's highest court. 

            BATTLE WITH CURRENT PRESIDENT

            Zuma is seeking to privately prosecute current President Cyril Ramaphosa — something that can happen in South Africa if the state prosecutor decides against laying charges — over the leaking of his medical records. Zuma says Ramaphosa needs to explain why he hasn't ordered an investigation into the leak by state prosecutors.

            The legal wrangle between Zuma and Ramaphosa is seen as part of a larger political battle between the two. 

            Analysts say Zuma finally going on trial for corruption is an indicator of Ramaphosa's willingness to ensure high-ranking figures in his own party face the law after years of alleged government corruption. Others serving in senior positions in government or the ANC were implicated in the graft inquiry where Zuma refused to testify.

            But the situation has been clouded by a scandal now enveloping Ramaphosa. He's been accused of breaking the law by holding more than $500,000 in U.S. currency at his ranch, money which was stolen in a robbery in 2020. 

            The existence of the cash and the robbery were kept under wraps until last year. The man who first revealed it and made the allegations against Ramaphosa was Zuma ally Fraser.

            Amid the scandal, Ramaphosa won re-election as leader of his party in December and succeeded in avoiding an impeachment inquiry in an initial vote in Parliament but faces further investigations and could be criminally charged.CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — The judge presiding over former South African President Jacob Zuma's corruption trial recused himself from the case this week, saying he didn't want there to be any chance that the proceedings could be viewed as biased against Zuma.It is the latest twist in just one of multiple legal battles involving the 80-year-old former South African leader, who resigned in 2018 amid mounting allegations of corruption but has retained political influence.Here is a look at the court cases involving Zuma and how they are impacting politics in Africa's most developed economy.CORRUPTION TRIALZuma was charged in 2021 with multiple counts of corruption over a multibillion-dollar arms deal that South Africa signed in 1999 with French company Thales, then known as Thomson-CSF. He is accused of taking hundreds of bribes to help Thales get the deal and faces at least 15 years in jail.Zuma is alleged to have taken the bribes while he was a political figure on the rise in the late 1990s and 2000s, although before he became president in 2009.Zuma was first implicated 20 years ago but charges against him were dropped and reinstated numerous times amid allegations of political interference.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797507,Apple embraces potential of sports streaming with MLS deal,"CUPERTINO, Calif. (AP) — After taking its first dip into sports streaming last year, Apple is now immersing itself. 

            The tech giant kicked off a 10-year partnership with Major League Soccer on Wednesday with the launch of Season Pass on Apple TV+.

            ""This is very important for us. It is one of the key things we are doing this year and for the next 10 years. We’re now part of a family together,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said during a presentation for MLS players, owners and media at Apple Park last month.











            The Apple launch comes after a transformative year for sports and streaming services. The NFL further embraced streaming last year as Prime Video carried “Thursday Night Football” and Major League Baseball partnered with Apple TV and Peacock to stream games. The NFL also reached an agreement with Google’s YouTube TV to carry the “Sunday Ticket” package beginning next season.

            Tech companies and broadcast outlets likewise see the value of live sports programming. According to a recent report by Parks Associates, revenue from sports streaming subscription packages is expected to increase 73% to $22.6 billion in 2027 after generating $13.1 billion last year. 

            In the era of cord cutting, tech companies, advertisers and sports leagues are also finding that younger viewers continue to migrate toward streaming and are watching for extended periods.

            According to Amazon tracking data, 22% of “Thursday Night Football” viewers on Prime Video were in the coveted 18-34 age demographic, compared with 14% of viewers watching NFL games on linear networks.

            The average viewing time for “Thursday Night” games was 85 minutes — nine minutes longer than games not on Prime. 

            Apple teaming with MLS makes sense for both parties. Various studies have found that soccer fans are more likely to watch sports on streaming devices or recorded TV.

            “This is a deal that expresses where things have been headed for a while and pushes them forward as well,” said Daniel Kirschner, the cofounder and CEO of Greenfly, a digital media distribution platform that works with over 30 leagues.

            MLS will receive at least $250 million per season from Apple. The league averaged $90 million per season under its previous eight-year agreements with Fox, ESPN and Univision.

            Apple has made previous forays into sports streaming, but this is its first significant involvement with a league. MLB aired two games on Apple TV+ on Friday nights last year, including the game where St. Louis’ Albert Pujols became the fourth player in baseball history to reach 700 career home runs.

            This deal could signal where sports streaming and league media rights are headed. 

            Apple and MLS are teaming up for a direct-to-consumer product that will allow fans to watch every game without local blackouts or restrictions and that reaches beyond North America. Fans in London, Paris and wherever the Apple TV app is available will be able to see the games as well.

            “We’ve looked at sports and acknowledged that there’s never been a better time to be a sports fan, and there’s also never been a worse time to be a sports fan,” said Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of services. “We have an opportunity with this partnership to make the experience a lot better for fans, and help grow the sport and the league in the US and beyond.”

            MLS is taking over the production of all its matches, similar to how European soccer leagues do business. But the other leagues, such as the Premier League and Germany’s Bundesliga, then sell their rights to broadcast outlets in each country. In this case, only one outlet — Apple — has worldwide rights.

            Even games on Fox in the United States, TSN and RDS in Canada and TelevisaUnivision will be on the Apple TV+ app.

            “I think they were the right league to recognize that the long-term value of their rights is best situated with a streaming partner or a technology partner, as opposed to the traditional leagues that sill need big billions of dollars of payments from traditional networks,” said Jon Cohen, senior vice president at Frequency, which provides software for ad-supported streaming channels. “I think it’s the right time for both to do this.”

            While Apple TV+ has had success as the first streaming service to receive an Oscar for Best Picture with “CODA” last year and “Ted Lasso” won back-to-back Emmys for Best Comedy, it is not turning into an entertainment company or studio. It remains a diversified company.

            “Sports drives a lot of engagement in terms of media. I think it shows that they have a very specific strategy with respect to growing their subscription and video services,” Cohen said.

            MLS and Apple’s progress will be watched closely by other leagues. While the NFL, NHL and baseball have wrapped up rights deals the past two years, the NBA is expected to have some streaming component when it begins negotiations on its media rights this year.

            Cue and Cook acknowledge there will be growing pains during the first year, especially with MLS getting up to speed with its own production company. Everyone, though, is focused on the potential of the project and the road ahead.

            “People are going to say we are the smartest guys in the room or we were a couple of years too early,” MLS Commissioner Don Garber said. “The opportunities are endless, but it is an undertaking with many tests.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797508,Google has the next move as Microsoft embraces OpenAI buzz,"NEW YORK (AP) — Before the artificial intelligence tool ChatGPT was unleashed into the world, the novelist Robin Sloan was testing a similar AI writing assistant built by researchers at Google.

            It didn’t take long for Sloan, author of the bestseller “Mr. Penumbra’s 24-Hour Bookstore,” to realize that the technology was of little use to him.

            “A lot of the state-of-the-art AI right now is impressive enough to really raise your expectations and make you think, ‘Wow, I’m dealing with something really, really capable,’” Sloan said. “But then in a thousand little ways, a million little ways, it ends up kind of disappointing you and betraying the fact that it really has no idea what’s going on.”











            Another company might have released the experiment into the wild anyway, as the startup OpenAI did with its ChatGPT tool late last year. But Google has been more cautious about who gets to play with its AI advancements despite growing pressure for the internet giant to compete more aggressively with rival Microsoft, which is pouring billions of dollars into OpenAI and fusing its technology into Microsoft products.

            That pressure is starting to take a toll, as Google has asked one of its AI teams to “prioritize working on a response to ChatGPT,” according to an internal memo reported this week by CNBC. Google declined to confirm if there was a public chatbot in the works but spokesperson Lily Lin said it continues ""to test our AI technology internally to make sure it’s helpful and safe, and we look forward to sharing more experiences externally soon.”

            Some of the technological breakthroughs driving the red-hot field of generative AI — which can churn out paragraphs of readable text and new images as well as music and video — have been pioneered in Google's vast research arm. 

            “So we have an important stake in this area, but we also have an important stake in not just leading in being able to generate things, but also in dealing with information quality,” said Zoubin Ghahramani, vice president of research at Google, in a November interview with The Associated Press.

            Ghahramani said the company wants to also be measured about what it releases, and how: “Do we want to make it accessible in a way that people can produce stuff en masse without any controls? The answer to that is no, not at this stage. I don’t think it would be responsible for us to be the people driving that.”

            And they weren't. Four weeks after the AP interview, OpenAI released its ChatGPT for free to anyone with an internet connection. Millions of people around the world have now tried it, sparking searing discussions at schools and corporate offices about the future of education and work.

            OpenAI declined to comment on comparisons with Google. But in announcing their extended partnership in January, Microsoft and OpenAI said they are committed to building “AI systems and products that are trustworthy and safe.”

            As a literary assistant, neither ChatGPT nor Google's creative writing version comes close to what a human can do, Sloan said.

            A fictionalized Google was central to the plot of Sloan's popular 2012 novel about a mysterious San Francisco bookstore. That's likely one reason the company invited him along with several other authors to test its experimental Wordcraft Writers Workshop, derived from a powerful AI system known as LaMDA.

            Like other language-learning models, including the GPT line built by OpenAI, Google's LaMDA can generate convincing passages of text and converse with humans based on what it's processed from a trove of online writings and digitized books. Facebook parent Meta and Amazon have also built their own big models, which can improve voice assistants like Alexa, predict the next sentence of an email or translate languages in real time.

            When it first announced its LaMDA model in 2021, Google emphasized its versatility but also raised the risks of harmful misuse and the possibility it could mimic and amplify biased, hateful or misleading information.

            Some of the Wordcraft writers found it useful as a research tool — like a faster and more decisive version of a Google search — as they asked for a list of “rabbit breeds and their magical qualities” or “a verb for the thing fireflies do” or to “Tell me about Venice in 1700,″ according to Google’s paper on the project. But it was less effective as a writer or rewriter, turning out boring sentences riddled with clichés and showing some gender bias.

            “I believe them — that they’re being thoughtful and cautious,” Sloan said of Google. “It’s just not the model of a reckless technologist who is in a hurry to get this out into the world no matter what.”

            Google's development of these models hasn't been without internal acrimony. First, it ousted some prominent researchers who were examining the risks of the technology. And last year, it fired an engineer who publicly posted a conversation with LaMDA in which the model falsely claimed it had human-like consciousness, with a “range of both feelings and emotions.”

            While ChatGPT and its competitors might never produce acclaimed works of literature, the expectation is they will soon begin to transform other professional tasks — from helping to debug computer code to composing marketing pitches and speeding up the production of a slide presentation. 

            That's key to why Microsoft, as a seller of workplace software, is eager to enhance its suite of products with the latest OpenAI tools. The benefits are less clear to Google, which largely depends on the advertising dollars it gets when people search for information online. 

            ""If you ask the question and get the wrong answer, it’s not great for a search engine,” said Dexter Thillien, a technology analyst for the London-based Economist Intelligence Unit.

            Microsoft also has a search engine — Bing — but ChatGPT's answers are too inaccurate and outdated, and the cost to run its queries too expensive, for the technology to pose a serious risk to Google's dominant search business, Thillien said.

            Google has said that its earlier large language model, named BERT, is already playing a role in answering online searches. Such models can help generate the fact boxes that increasingly appear next to Google's ranked list of web links.

            Asked in November about the hype around AI applications such as OpenAI's image-generator DALL-E, Ghahramani acknowledged, in a playful tone, that “it’s a little bit annoying sometimes because we know that we have developed a lot of these technologies.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797509,US opens embassy in Solomon Islands to counter China,"WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — The United States opened an embassy in the Solomon Islands on Thursday in its latest move to counter China's push into the Pacific.

            The embassy in the capital, Honiara, is starting small, with a chargé d’affaires, a couple of State Department staff and a handful of local employees. The U.S. previously operated an embassy in the Solomon Islands for five years before closing it in 1993 as part of a global reduction in diplomatic posts after the end of the Cold War.

            But China's bold moves in the region have the U.S. seeking to increase its engagement in a number of ways, such as by donating COVID-19 vaccines, bringing back Peace Corps volunteers to several island nations, and investing in forestry and tourism projects.











            “The opening of the embassy builds on our efforts not only to place more diplomatic personnel throughout the region, but also to engage further with our Pacific neighbors, connect United States programs and resources with needs on the ground, and build people-to-people ties,” said Secretary of State Antony Blinken in a statement.

            The opening comes as Fiji's new leader, Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka, appears to be reassessing some aspects of his nation's engagement with China. Rabuka told The Fiji Times last week he planned to end a police training and exchange agreement with China.

            The U.S. State Department notified lawmakers early last year that China’s growing influence in the region made reopening the Solomon Islands embassy a priority. Since then, the Solomons has signed a security pact with China, raising fears of a military buildup in the region, and the U.S. has countered by sending several high-level delegations.

            The Solomon Islands switched allegiance from the self-ruled island of Taiwan to Beijing in 2019, threatening the close ties with the U.S. that date to World War II.

            “We are seeing this bond weaken as the People’s Republic of China aggressively seeks to engage Solomon Islands’ political and business elites, utilizing a familiar pattern of extravagant promises, prospective costly infrastructure loans, and potentially dangerous debt levels,” the department said in a December notice to Congress that was obtained by The Associated Press.

            A senior State Department official who insisted on anonymity to brief the media said the U.S. had been encouraged by the Solomon Islands' commitment to continue working with traditional security partners such as Australia and the U.S., but remained concerned about the secrecy surrounding the security agreement with China.

            He said any type of militarization in the Pacific by China would be a great concern.

            The official said the U.S. had yet to have deep conversations with the new Fijian leadership so it was too early to tell if the move on policing signaled a change in direction for Fiji on China.

            The Fijian government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — The United States opened an embassy in the Solomon Islands on Thursday in its latest move to counter China's push into the Pacific.The embassy in the capital, Honiara, is starting small, with a chargé d’affaires, a couple of State Department staff and a handful of local employees. The U.S. previously operated an embassy in the Solomon Islands for five years before closing it in 1993 as part of a global reduction in diplomatic posts after the end of the Cold War.But China's bold moves in the region have the U.S. seeking to increase its engagement in a number of ways, such as by donating COVID-19 vaccines, bringing back Peace Corps volunteers to several island nations, and investing in forestry and tourism projects.“The opening of the embassy builds on our efforts not only to place more diplomatic personnel throughout the region, but also to engage further with our Pacific neighbors, connect United States programs and resources with needs on the ground, and build people-to-people ties,” said Secretary of State Antony Blinken in a statement.The opening comes as Fiji's new leader, Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka, appears to be reassessing some aspects of his nation's engagement with China. Rabuka told The Fiji Times last week he planned to end a police training and exchange agreement with China.The U.S. State Department notified lawmakers early last year that China’s growing influence in the region made reopening the Solomon Islands embassy a priority. Since then, the Solomons has signed a security pact with China, raising fears of a military buildup in the region, and the U.S. has countered by sending several high-level delegations.The Solomon Islands switched allegiance from the self-ruled island of Taiwan to Beijing in 2019, threatening the close ties with the U.S. that date to World War II.“We are seeing this bond weaken as the People’s Republic of China aggressively seeks to engage Solomon Islands’ political and business elites, utilizing a familiar pattern of extravagant promises, prospective costly infrastructure loans, and potentially dangerous debt levels,” the department said in a December notice to Congress that was obtained by The Associated Press.A senior State Department official who insisted on anonymity to brief the media said the U.S. had been encouraged by the Solomon Islands' commitment to continue working with traditional security partners such as Australia and the U.S., but remained concerned about the secrecy surrounding the security agreement with China.He said any type of militarization in the Pacific by China would be a great concern.The official said the U.S. had yet to have deep conversations with the new Fijian leadership so it was too early to tell if the move on policing signaled a change in direction for Fiji on China.The Fijian government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",2023/02/02,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797512,Kosovo leader says ethnic Serb association isn't a priority,"PRISTINA, Kosovo (AP) — Kosovo’s prime minister said Wednesday that creating an association of the country's five Serb-majority municipalities was not a priority for his Cabinet even though the U.S. has argued the issue is important to an eventual normalization of ties between Kosovo and Serbia.

            Prime Minister Albin Kurti repeated concerns that such an organization could evolve into a ministate and said resuming European Union-led negotiations between Serbia and Kosovo would be more productive. 

            “A monoethnic association in a multiethnic Kosovo is not possible,” Kurti told journalists.











            Washington has increased pressure on Pristina to implement a 2013 agreement to establish the Association of Serb-Majority Municipalities, which would coordinate work on education, health care, land planning and economic development at the local level. Kosovo’s Constitutional Court later declared the plan unconstitutional, ruling it wasn’t inclusive of other ethnicities and could entail the use of executive powers.

            Diplomats from the U.S. Embassy in Pristina met this week with a group of civil society leaders, government officials and political leaders to discuss the steps Kosovo's government needs to take to authorize the association. U.S. and European Union envoy s also visited Kosovo and Serbia last month to encourage the two countries to accept a new proposal for normalizing their relations and furthering their candidacies for EU membership.

            The proposal’s details haven’t yet been made public. 

            U.S. Ambassador to Kosovo Jeff Hovenier sought to address the concerns of Kurti's government by reiterating that Washington opposed setting up the Association of Serb-Majority Municipalities, or ASM, to resemble Republika Srpska, one of two political entities in Bosnia with broad governing authority. 

            Kurti remained skeptical, asserting that while Serbia has recognized Bosnia's statehood de jure, “de facto it sabotages it everyday.” 

            “Let’s discuss it, listen to everyone,"" he said of the renewed push to create the ASM. ""But you cannot ask from the prime minister of the republic to violate the people’s will and state interests.” 

            Kurti said Wednesday that Kosovo and Serbia have signed 33 agreements during 12 years of EU-mediated negotiations and all “are equal; you can’t pick up one they like as a priority.”

            He mentioned the barricades ethnic Serbs erected in northern Kosovo in December to protest the arrest of a Serb police officer. The barricades were removed only after mediation by Washington and Brussels.

            Serbia fought a 1998-99 war with ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo, which at the time was a Serbian province. A NATO intervention that forced Serbia to pull out of the territory ended the war, but tensions over Kosovo's status remains a source of instability in the Balkans.

            In 2008, Kosovo declared independence from Serbia, which Belgrade has refused to recognize, supported by Russia and China. The U.S. and most EU nations have recognized Kosovo as a sovereign nation.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797513,Stewart heads to New York on 1st day of WNBA free agency,"Breanna Stewart couldn't turn down a chance to play in New York and potentially help the Liberty win their first WNBA championship.

            The most coveted free agent this offseason, who won the WNBA MVP award in 2018, announced on social media that she was going to New York with a photo of her in a Liberty shirt on Wednesday. Stewart had spent her entire career in Seattle since the Storm drafted her No. 1 overall in 2016. She won championships with the team in 2018 and 2020.

            “I decided to go to New York as I wanted to continue to be great. And I wanted to go to the place where I think I can help this league become better, to raise the standard,” Stewart said in an interview on ESPN. “I feel like why not go to the biggest market in all of sports. I’m excited to go after their first championship.”











            The 28-year-old wing has averaged 20.3 points and 8.6 rebounds in her WNBA career. She missed the 2019 season with an Achilles tendon injury.

            “New York is a basketball city and I can’t wait to be a part of it,” Stewart said.

            Coming to New York brings Stewart closer to home. She grew up in Syracuse, which is an hourlong flight away. She'll also have a shorter flight to Spain to visit relatives of her wife, Marta.

            New York representatives, including coach Sandy Brondello and co-owner Clara Wu Tsai met with Stewart in Turkey last week. Stewart had narrowed her choices to Seattle and New York before choosing the Liberty.

            The move turns the Liberty into an instant championship contender. New York, one of the WNBA's original franchises, has never won a championship. The Liberty already added 2021 MVP Jonquel Jones and Kayla Thornton through a three-way deal to complement 2020 No. 1 draft pick Sabrina Ionescu.

            “I think this group has a ton of potential, a lot of amazing players,” Stewart said. “The selflessness helps us set ourselves apart from everyone else.”

            The news was met with elation on social media by Jones, Ionescu and Brooklyn Nets star Kevin Durant, who said on a podcast that he had reached out to Stewart to get her to come to New York.

            Stewart was the second big-name free agent to announce her intentions to play for another team. Candace Parker said last weekend she was going to sign with the Las Vegas Aces and did so on Wednesday.

            “As I’ve gone through free agency this time around, of course I’m thinking of where I can compete for my third championship, but the words home and family are what I kept coming back to,"" said Parker, a longtime Southern California resident. “After evaluating the landscape together with my family, we’ve decided the Las Vegas Aces are the right organization for us at this point in our lives. To play for a championship close to home is the perfect situation for us. I’m looking forward to continuing the journey this summer in Las Vegas.”

            Wednesday was the first day that free agents could sign contracts. Other moves announced included:

            — Brittney Sykes and Shatori Walker-Kimbrough with Washington.

            — Lexie Brown and Stephanie Talbot with Los Angeles.

            — Teaira McCowan with Dallas.

            — Alysha Clark and Cayla George with Las Vegas.

            — AD Durr and Nia Coffey with Atlanta.

            Many free agents were waiting for Stewart to make her decision, including Courtney Vandersloot.

            Vandersloot announced on social media late Tuesday night that she wasn’t returning to Chicago, where she had spent her entire career. She has led the league in assists six times during her 12-year career and helped the Sky win the 2021 WNBA championship.

            “To the Sky organization who drafted the little guard from a mid-major and believed in me from the jump, I couldn’t have asked for anything better,” Vandersloot wrote on Instagram. “Thank you from the bottom of my heart. I have realized my dreams because of you. Although I never planned for this day to come, I have decided it is time for me to pursue a new beginning.”

            Stewart and Vandersloot are currently playing together in Turkey.

            “My message to Sloot is she knows I love to play with her, but I'm going to support her in any decision she makes,” Stewart said. “Free agency is hard. It’s been an emotional rollercoaster for everybody. It’s not only basketball these decisions are made behind. It’s life.”

            While Stewart and Vandersloot will be playing for different WNBA teams, Brittney Griner, who is also a free agent, announced in December when she returned home from her 10-month ordeal in Russia that she planned to remain with the Phoenix Mercury. Her long-time Mercury teammate Diana Taurasi is also a free agent, but she too is expected to go back to Phoenix.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797515,AP source: Rhule files $5M arbitration suit vs. Panthers,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — Nebraska football coach Matt Rhule has filed an arbitration suit with the NFL against the Carolina Panthers seeking about $5 million in offset severance compensation, a person with knowledge of the situation told The Associated Press on Wednesday.

            Rhule was fired as Panthers head coach on Oct. 10. He has since hired high-profile New York City litigator John Singer of Singer Deutsch LLP to handle the lawsuit, according to the person who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because the arbitration suit has not been made public.

            A Panthers spokesman would not confirm the suit and declined to comment to the AP. Rhule, reached by text, also declined to comment.











            CBS Sports was first to report the arbitration suit.

            Rhule was fired after Week 5 of the NFL season, less than three years into a seven-year, $62 million contract. He was 11-27 as head coach with the Panthers. He was owed approximately $34 million at the time he was fired by billionaire David Tepper, the NFL's second-wealthiest owner.

            Rhule returned to college coaching in November when he was hired by Nebraska, receiving a reported eight-year, $72 million contract that seemingly offset what the Panthers owed him. But the arbitration suit alleges the Panthers still owe him about $5 million because of how the contract with Carolina was structured.

            The Panthers introduced Frank Reich as their new head coach at a news conference on Tuesday.

            Tepper said he made a “mistake” hiring Rhule, whom he described as a ""CEO-type head coach.” Tepper added that it is “preferable to have a coach that is really extraordinary on one side of the ball or the other side of the ball.”

            “Listen, I’ll self-admit — we could have run a better process last time,” Tepper said. “And I am learning. ... With all humility, I could have done better, OK? I’m not saying that Rhule wasn’t a good coach. I’m not saying that. Please don’t interpret it that way. I’m saying I could have run a better process last time. I do believe that. I think this time we were very thorough. I was in every single interview.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797516,"20 attorneys general warn Walgreens, CVS over abortion pills","ST. LOUIS (AP) — Attorneys general in 20 conservative-led states warned CVS and Walgreens on Wednesday that they could face legal consequences if they sell abortion pills by mail in those states.

            A letter from Republican Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey to the nation's largest pharmacy-dispensing companies was co-signed by 19 other attorneys general, warning that sale of abortion pills would violate federal law and abortion laws in many states. Missouri is among states that implemented strict abortion prohibitions last summer after the Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade.

            Bailey didn't specify what legal action he would take if the pharmacies begin selling abortion pills to Missourians by mail.











            “I will enforce the laws as written,"" Bailey said in a statement in response to questions from The Associated Press. ""That includes laws protecting the health of women and their unborn children. The FDA rule is in direct violation of federal law, and the unelected bureaucrats at the FDA have no authority to change Missouri law, either. The people’s elected representatives have spoken on the issue of abortion in our state, and we will fight to uphold that in court.”

            Nineteen states have imposed restrictions on abortion pills, but there’s a court battle over whether they have the power to do so in defiance of U.S. Food and Drug Administration policy. A physician and a company that makes the pill mifepristone filed separate lawsuits last month seeking to strike down bans in North Carolina and West Virginia.

            For more than 20 years, the FDA limited dispensing of the drug to a subset of specialty offices and clinics because of safety concerns. But since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the agency eased restrictions, eliminating the in-person requirement for the pill and allowing brick-and-mortar pharmacies to dispense it. At least one lawsuit filed by abortion opponents argues that the FDA has overstepped its authority in approving the abortion drugs.

            A spokesman for Walgreens said the company is not currently dispensing mifepristone, although they are working to become eligible through an FDA-mandated certification process, requiring pharmacies to meet specific standards in shipping, tracking and confidentially storing drug prescribing records.

            “We fully understand that we may not be able to dispense Mifepristone in all locations if we are certified under the program,” a statement from spokesman Fraser Engerman read.

            Messages left with CVS were not immediately returned.

            On Jan. 3, the FDA finalized a rule change that broadens availability of abortion pills to many more pharmacies, including large chains and mail-order companies.

            The letter to the pharmacy giants said President Joe Biden's administration's endorsement of abortion pills by mail is “an attempt to circumvent the right of states to protect women and children.” It was co-signed by attorneys general in Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, and West Virginia.

            The Missouri law was written in 2019 to go into effect if Roe v. Wade was ever overturned. It was implemented almost immediately after the Supreme Court decision was announced in June. The law makes it a felony punishable by five to 15 years in prison to perform or induce an abortion. Medical professionals who do so also could lose their licenses. The law says that women undergoing abortions cannot be prosecuted.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797532,Taliban asks Pakistan not to blame them for violence at home,"ISLAMABAD (AP) — Afghanistan's Taliban-appointed foreign minister Wednesday asked Pakistani authorities to look for the reasons behind militant violence in their country instead of blaming Afghanistan.

            The comments from Amir Khan Muttaqi came two days after Pakistani officials said the attackers who orchestrated Monday's suicide bombing that killed 101 people in northwest Pakistan staged the attack on Afghan soil.

            During a ceremony to inaugurate a drug addiction treatment center in the capital of Kabul on Wednesday, Muttaqi asked Pakistan's government to launch a serious investigation into Monday’s mosque bombing in Peshawar.











            He insisted that Afghanistan was not a center for terrorism, saying if that was the case then attacks would have also taken place in other countries. 

            “If anyone says that Afghanistan is the center for terrorism, they also say that terrorism has no border,"" Muttaqi said. “If terrorism had emanated from Afghanistan, it would have also impacted China, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan or Iran.""

            “We have to cooperate with each other, instead of blaming each other,"" he said. “Both countries are brothers to each other and must work in a peaceful environment together.”

            Authorities in Pakistan said Wednesday the death toll from Monday's suicide bombing at a mosque in Peshawar increased by one to 101. It was not clear how the bomber was able to slip into the walled police compound in a high-security zone with other government buildings. 

            Pakistan Defense Minister Khawaja Mohammad Asif on Tuesday accused the Pakistani Taliban, or Tahreek-e Taliban-Pakistani, or TTP, of carrying out the attack, saying they were operating from neighboring Afghan territory. He demanded the Afghan Taliban take action against them. A TTP commander earlier claimed responsibility, but a spokesperson for the group later distanced the TTP from the carnage, saying it was not its policy to attack mosques. 

            During the nearly 20-year U.S. war against the Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan, militant groups blossomed in the tribal regions of Pakistan along the border and around Peshawar. Like the Taliban, they took root among the ethnic Pashtuns who make up a majority in the region and in the city. 

            Some groups were encouraged by the Pakistani intelligence agencies. But others turned their guns against the government, angered by heavy security crackdowns and by frequent U.S. airstrikes in the border region targeting al-Qaida and other militants.

            Chief among the anti-government groups was the Pakistani Taliban. In the late 2000s and early 2010s, it waged a brutal campaign of violence around the country. Peshawar was the scene of one of the bloodiest TTP attacks in 2014, on an army-run public school that killed nearly 150 people, most of them schoolboys.ISLAMABAD (AP) — Afghanistan's Taliban-appointed foreign minister Wednesday asked Pakistani authorities to look for the reasons behind militant violence in their country instead of blaming Afghanistan.The comments from Amir Khan Muttaqi came two days after Pakistani officials said the attackers who orchestrated Monday's suicide bombing that killed 101 people in northwest Pakistan staged the attack on Afghan soil.During a ceremony to inaugurate a drug addiction treatment center in the capital of Kabul on Wednesday, Muttaqi asked Pakistan's government to launch a serious investigation into Monday’s mosque bombing in Peshawar.He insisted that Afghanistan was not a center for terrorism, saying if that was the case then attacks would have also taken place in other countries.“If anyone says that Afghanistan is the center for terrorism, they also say that terrorism has no border,"" Muttaqi said. “If terrorism had emanated from Afghanistan, it would have also impacted China, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan or Iran.""“We have to cooperate with each other, instead of blaming each other,"" he said. “Both countries are brothers to each other and must work in a peaceful environment together.”Authorities in Pakistan said Wednesday the death toll from Monday's suicide bombing at a mosque in Peshawar increased by one to 101.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797535,Records: 'Dances with Wolves' actor armed cult against cops,"LAS VEGAS (AP) — Nathan Chasing Horse trained his wives to use firearms, instructing them to “shoot it out” with police officers if they ever tried to “break their family apart,” according to records obtained by The Associated Press. If that failed, the actor from “Dancing With Wolves” said they should take “suicide pills.""

            The abuse that authorities said spanned two decades led Tuesday to the arrest of Chasing Horse following a monthslong investigation by Las Vegas police. He was taken into custody as he left the home he shares with his five wives in North Las Vegas. SWAT officers were seen outside the two-story home in the evening as detectives searched the property.

            During the raid, police found memory cards with videos of the sexual assaults, firearms, 41 pounds of marijuana and psilocybin mushrooms in the home, according to an arrest report released Wednesday.











            Known for his role as the young Sioux tribe member Smiles a Lot in the Oscar-winning Kevin Costner film “Dances with Wolves,"" Chasing Horse gained a reputation among tribes across the United States and in Canada as a so-called medicine man who performed healing ceremonies. But police said he abused his position, physically and sexually assaulting Indigenous girls and women, taking underage wives and leading a cult. 

            Chasing Horse, 46, will be charged with at least two counts of sex trafficking and one count each of sexual assault of a child younger than 16, child abuse or neglect and sexual assault, according to court records. Authorities have not said when he will be formally charged.

            He was booked before midnight into Clark County’s jail, where he remained held without bail on the sexual assault charges as he awaits his first court appearance, expected Thursday in North Las Vegas. There was no lawyer listed in court records for Chasing Horse who could comment on his behalf, and Las Vegas police said he was “unable” to give a jailhouse interview Wednesday.

            According to a 50-page search warrant obtained by the AP, Chasing Horse is believed to be the leader of a cult known as The Circle. 

            At least two women told police that Chasing Horse had shown his wives a stash of “small white pills” that he called “suicide pills” sometime in 2019 or 2020, years before his arrest. 

            The women were instructed to “take a pill to kill themselves in the event he dies or law enforcement tries to break their family apart,"" according to the warrant.

            One of Chasing Horse's former wives also told police that she believed his current wives would “carry out the instructions” to take the pills and open fire on law enforcement if officers came to the home to arrest Chasing Horse.

            Las Vegas police said in the document they have identified at least six sexual assault victims, some who were as young as 14 when they say they were abused, and traced the sexual allegations against Chasing Horse to the early 2000s in multiple states, including Nevada, where he has lived for about a decade, and South Dakota and Montana.

            “Nathan Chasing Horse used spiritual traditions and their belief system as a tool to sexually assault young girls on numerous occasions,” detectives wrote in the warrant, adding that his followers referred to him as “Medicine Man” or “Holy Person” because they believed he could communicate with higher beings.

            One of Chasing Horse’s wives was offered to him as a “gift” when she was 15, according to police, while another became a wife after turning 16.

            Chasing Horse also is accused of recording sexual assaults and arranging sex with the victims for other men who paid him.

            He was arrested nearly a decade after he was banished from the Fort Peck Reservation in Poplar, Montana, amid allegations of human trafficking.

            Fort Peck tribal leaders had voted 7-0 to ban Chasing Horse from stepping foot again on the reservation, citing the trafficking allegations in addition to accusations of drug dealing, spiritual abuse and intimidation of tribal members, Indian Country Today reported.

            State attorneys general and lawmakers around the U.S. are looking into creating specialized units to handle cases involving Native American women.

            In South Dakota, where police said Chasing Horse committed some of his crimes, the attorney general’s office has put a new focus on crimes against Native American people, including human trafficking and killings.

            Chasing Horse was born on the Rosebud Reservation in South Dakota, which is home to the Sicangu Sioux, one of the seven tribes of the Lakota nation.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797536,Ex-ABC journalist charged in child sexual exploitation case,"A well-known former investigative journalist for ABC News has been arrested on a charge of “transporting” images depicting the sexual abuse of children, the Department of Justice said on Wednesday. 

            James Gordon Meek, 53, of Arlington, Virginia, who covered national security and the military, was arrested Tuesday, months after his home was searched by federal authorities. 

            Authorities found images of children engaged in sexually explicit conduct on electronic devices taken from his home. Authorities also discovered multiple conversations in which “participants expressed enthusiasm for the sexual abuse of children,"" according to court papers. 











            He faces a charge of transportation of child pornography, which calls for a minimum of five years and up to 20 years in prison, officials said. An email seeking comment was sent to Meek's attorney. 

            ABC News declined to comment Wednesday. Meek resigned from ABC News last year.

            The FBI's investigation was prompted by a tip from Dropbox about videos showing the sexual abuse of children found in March 2021 in an account that was associated with Meek, according to court papers. Federal authorities searched his home in April. 

            Investigators also found that Meek engaged with minors on platforms like Snapchat, according to court documents. A minor interviewed by law enforcement told authorities that Meek approached her through Snapchat and pressured her to provide sexually explicit photos, according to court papers. 

            Meek joined ABC News' Washington bureau as an investigative producer in 2013. He previously worked for the New York Daily News and also served as senior counterterrorism adviser and investigator for the U.S. House Committee on Homeland Security.

(AP) — The Augusta National Women's Amateur has attracted the top 45 players in the world and will have expanded television coverage for the fourth edition of what quickly has become one of the premier events for female amateurs.

            The tournament starts March 29 for two rounds at Champions Retreat before going to Augusta National for a practice round Friday and the final round on Saturday.

            Golf Channel will televise the opening two rounds, and then NBC again shows the final round from the home of the Masters.











            Rose Zhang, the No. 1 amateur in women's golf, leads the 70 players who have accepted invitations. That leaves two spots to be filled, one potentially coming from the winner of the Asia Pacific Women's Amateur next month in Singapore.

            The top 45 come from the final World Amateur Golf Ranking of 2022.

            The field includes the last two winners, defending champion Anna Davis from San Diego County and Tsubasa Kajitani of Japan.

            This will be the first time top amateurs do not have to decide between the Augusta National Women's Amateur and the first LPGA Tour major of the year, which also invites leading amateurs. The Chevron Championship has moved from the California desert to Houston, and it has left its former date of a week before the Masters.

            Also new to the Augusta National Women's Amateur this year is the absence of a playoff. The top 30 players after two rounds advance to the final round; there previously was a playoff to get the number to 30 players.

            This year, the top 30 and ties will advance to the final round at Augusta National. All 72 players can play a practice round Friday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797538,Cohen says DA took phones for renewed Trump hush-money probe,"NEW YORK (AP) — Donald Trump’s long-estranged former lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen, says Manhattan prosecutors recently took his cellphones to preserve evidence related to a hush-money payment he made to porn actress Stormy Daniels in the waning weeks of the 2016 presidential campaign.

            The payment to Daniels, which Cohen says was intended to buy her silence about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump, has been the subject of law-enforcement scrutiny for years, but a new grand jury is giving it a fresh look.

            Cohen said Wednesday that Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s office asked for the phones because it wants to extract voice recordings of conversations he had with a lawyer for Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, as well as emails and text messages.











            “That way it could be used as evidence if in fact they proceed forward, which, I would suspect they are,” Cohen said in an appearance on CNN.

            Cohen told the AP on Wednesday that Manhattan prosecutors investigating the payments asked him for the devices after they met with him recently to discuss the probe. Cohen said he was questioned for about 2½ hours. He is also expected to testify before the grand jury at some point.

            Cohen went to prison in 2019 after pleading guilty to tax evasion, lying to Congress and campaign finance crimes. He has since finished his sentence.

            The campaign finance charges were related to the payment to Daniels and a similar payout Cohen arranged to the model Karen McDougal. Both women said they had trysts with Trump during his days as a reality TV star. Trump says those stories aren't true. 

            Federal prosecutors said during Cohen's criminal case that Trump was aware of the payments to the women. The U.S. attorney's office in New York, however, declined at the time to seek a criminal charge against the then-sitting president.

            Cohen told CNN that the material is “the same stuff” the FBI obtained from him in a raid in 2018, “but it’s new to the district attorney. They’ve seen some of it but now they’re in full possession of it.”

            Bragg has empaneled a new grand jury to hear evidence about hush-money payments made to women alleging affairs with Trump, two people familiar with the investigation told the AP. The people were not authorized to speak publicly about the grand jury proceeding, which is secret, and did so on condition of anonymity.

            The existence of the grand jury has been previously reported by multiple news organizations.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797541,"Qatar Airways, Airbus reach settlement in A350 legal case","LONDON (AP) — Qatar Airways and Airbus have reached a settlement in a longstanding legal dispute over the safety of the A350 jetliner and billions of orders for other planes.

            The companies said in a joint statement Wednesday that the settlement was “amicable and mutually agreeable.’’

            “A repair project is now underway and both parties look forward to getting these aircraft safely back in the air,’’ the companies said in a statement.











            Qatar Airways had grounded Airbus A350s over what it described as fuselages “degrading at an accelerated rate” in the long-range aircraft. The airline had raised questions about the A350s’ carbon composite fuselage, designed to make the twin-aisle aircraft lighter and cheaper to operate by burning less jet fuel.

            In December 2021, Qatar’s national carrier announced it was suing Airbus in London over what it described as the “accelerated surface degradation” of the wide-body A350. 

            The next month, European planemaker Airbus terminated a multibillion-dollar order by Qatar Airways for 50 of its smaller single-aisle in-demand A321neo jets. The termination of the contract for the Airbus 321neos followed Qatar Airways' refusal to take any more A350s until the problem was fixed.

            Now that the dispute has been resolved, Airbus will “reintegrate” Qatar's 50 A321neo orders, with deliveries due to resume in 2026, Airbus spokesman Justin Dubon said. The Toulouse, France-based planemaker also will resume deliveries this year of 23 A350s that that airline had put on hold because of the dispute, he said. 

            The details of the settlement are confidential, and there was no admission of liability.

            “This agreement will enable Qatar Airways and Airbus to move forward and work together as partners,'' the companies' statement said.LONDON (AP) — Qatar Airways and Airbus have reached a settlement in a longstanding legal dispute over the safety of the A350 jetliner and billions of orders for other planes.The companies said in a joint statement Wednesday that the settlement was “amicable and mutually agreeable.’’“A repair project is now underway and both parties look forward to getting these aircraft safely back in the air,’’ the companies said in a statement.Qatar Airways had grounded Airbus A350s over what it described as fuselages “degrading at an accelerated rate” in the long-range aircraft.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797543,Eagles reserve lineman accused of rape ahead of Super Bowl,"CAMBRIDGE, Ohio (AP) — Josh Sills, a reserve offensive lineman for the NFC champion Philadelphia Eagles, has been indicted on rape and kidnapping charges that stem from an incident in Ohio just over three years ago, authorities said Wednesday. 

            Sills, an undrafted free agent who appeared in just one game this season, was placed on the commissioner’s exempt list. That means he can’t practice, play or travel with the team as it prepares for the Super Bowl.

            The NFL announced the move Wednesday and said the issue is being reviewed under the league's personal conduct policy.











            The rookie, who played at West Virginia and Oklahoma State, was indicted Tuesday by a Guernsey County grand jury in Ohio and ordered to appear in court on Feb. 16, four days after the Eagles are to play the Kansas City Chiefs in the Super Bowl. 

            His attorney, Michael Connick, said the allegations are false and that Sills will be aggressively defended.

            Sills was listed as a backup guard and played just four snaps on special teams against the Cardinals on Oct. 9, the one game he played. He was on the inactive list for most of the year, including this past Sunday in Philadelphia’s conference title victory over the San Francisco 49ers.

            “The organization is aware of the legal matter involving Josh Sills. We have been in communication with the league office and are in the process of gathering more information. We have no further comment at this time,” the Eagles said in a statement. 

            The indictment accuses Sills, who is from Sarahsville, Ohio, of engaging in sexual activity that was not consensual and holding a woman against her will on Dec. 5, 2019. 

            A statement issued by Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost said the incident was immediately reported, and that the county sheriff’s office conducted a detailed investigation.CAMBRIDGE, Ohio (AP) — Josh Sills, a reserve offensive lineman for the NFC champion Philadelphia Eagles, has been indicted on rape and kidnapping charges that stem from an incident in Ohio just over three years ago, authorities said Wednesday.Sills, an undrafted free agent who appeared in just one game this season, was placed on the commissioner’s exempt list.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797546,M's beat Diego Castillo in year's 1st arbitration decision,"ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) — The Seattle Mariners defeated Diego Castillo in the first salary arbitration decision this year, and the relief pitcher will get a raise to $2.95 million rather than his request of $3,225,000.

            Richard Bloch, Melinda Gordon and Brian Keller made the decision on Wednesday, a day after hearing arguments.

            A 29-year-old right-hander who made $2.15 million last season, Castillo was 7-3 with a 3.64 ERA and seven saves in 59 relief appearances, striking out 53 and walking 22 in 54 1/3 innings. The Mariners made the playoffs for the first time since 2001 and lost to eventual World Series champion Houston in the Division Series.











            Castillo signed with the Rays in 2014 and pitched for Tampa Bay from 2018 until he was traded to Seattle in July 2021. He is 24-18 with a 3.12 ERA and 35 saves in five major league seasons, and is eligible for free agency after the 2024 World Series.

            Outfielder Teoscar Hernández, acquired by the Mariners from Toronto, also remains on track for a hearing. He asked for a raise from $10.65 million to $16 million, and Seattle offered $14 million.

            
                Angels outfielder Hunter Renfroe and Los Angeles argued the first case of the year on Monday in a decision that is being held for later announcement. He asked for a raise from $7.65 million to $11.9 million, and the Angels argued for $11.25 million.

            Twenty-four players remain scheduled for hearings, to take place through Feb. 17.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797549,Turkey's Erdogan again rebukes Sweden over NATO bid,"Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Wednesday again shot down Sweden's bid to join NATO, after the Quran was recently burned in the Swedish capital of Stockholm.""Sweden, don't even bother! As long as you allow my holy book, the Quran, to be burned and torn, and you do so together with your security forces, we will not say 'yes' to your entry into NATO,"" Erdogan told lawmakers in his conservative AKP party.The burning of the Quran last month in Stockholm by a far-right activist has stirred outrage in Muslim-majority Turkey, with recent protests taking place in front of Swedish diplomatic missions in Istanbul and Ankara. Muslims consider the desecration of the Quran to be a form of blasphemy.Both Sweden and Finland submitted a joint application last year to NATO amid security concerns due to Russia's war on Ukraine.Under current rules, all 30 members of the NATO alliance must agree unanimously in order for a new country to join. Another NATO country, Hungary, has also expressed skepticism towards Sweden's application following the Quran burning.The Swedish government has condemned protests where anti-Muslim activities took place, but has also said the demonstrations fall under freedom of speech protections. Swedish Foreign Minister Tobias Billstrom said ""religion is not part of the agreement"" it signed last year with Turkey regarding NATO membership.The protesters in Sweden have also criticized Turkey's actions towards its Kurdish minority — demonstrators last month hanged an effigy of Erdogan. Turkey was outraged by this act, with the Turkish government accusing the protesters of being linked to the Kurdish PKK group.The PKK are not only considered to be a terrorist organization by Turkey, but also the US and EU.Although Erdogan has expressed disapproval of Sweden's bid, the Turkish leader said ""our position on Finland is positive.""An official statement from Finland on Wednesday said the country remains adamant that it will join NATO with Sweden at the same time.Finnish Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto had suggested last month in an interview that Finland could join the defense pact without its Nordic neighbor.Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said earlier Wednesday that if Finland does indeed decide to go it alone on the NATO application, Turkey ""will then of course reconsider Finland's membership separately and more favorably.""wd/nm (Reuters, AP)",2023/02/01,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797550,"India budget unveils infrastructure, green energy plans","India will boost its spending on infrastructure and focus on creating more jobs, according to the government's annual federal budget unveiled on Wednesday.Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented to parliament an annual federal budget of $550 billion (€503 billion) for the 2023-24 financial year.""After a subdued period of the pandemic, private investments are growing again,"" the finance minister said.""Capital investment is being increased steeply for the third year in a row by 33% to 10 trillion rupees,"" she added. That is the equivalent of $122 billion the government is planning to spend on the construction of schools, airports and ports.While India's economy is projected to grow 7% in the fiscal year ending next March, the government forecasts growth of 6-6.5% next year.While the budget put an emphasis on boosting infrastructure to spur economic growth, it also lays focus on creating more jobs, ramping up welfare schemes, slashing taxes for the middle class, and boosting renewable energy.The government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been under pressure to generate more jobs as it faces key state polls this year and a general election in 2024. Sitharaman said there was ""the need once again to ramp up the virtuous cycle of investment and job creation.""India surpassed the United Kingdom last year to become the world's fifth largest — and Asia's third largest — economy. On Wednesday, Modi praised the budget as laying a strong ""foundation for the aspirations and resolutions of a developed India.""Finance Minister Sitharaman said ""green growth"" is a top priority for the country and announced several new initiatives.The budget provided around 35,000 crore rupees, or $4.3 billion, to ramp up energy transition initiatives to help India reach its goal of net-zero emissions by 2070. India is currently the world's third highest-emitting nation.Sitharaman announced around $8 billion for other projects as well, including mangrove restoration and converting waste into biogas.The government also slashed taxes for India's large middle class — individuals with income up to 700,000 rupees ($8,560, €7,840) will not have to pay tax under the new income tax regime. A host of new tax relief measures is also expected to drive consumption.Despite the tax cuts, Sitharaman said the goverment is aiming for a budget deficit of 5.9% of India's gross domestic product for the fiscal year ending next March, lower than the 6.4% for this fiscal year.The budget also extended a $24 billion scheme to provide free grains to vulnerable households for one year and hiked spending by 66% on providing affordable housing to the urban poor.In the budget, India boosted its defense expenditure to around $73 billion — a 13% rise — as it faces tensions with China on their disputed Himalayan border. But the resources allocated specifically for the modernization of the armed forces saw only a moderate hike, according to experts.India plans to spend almost 242 billion rupees ($3 billion) for naval fleet construction and 571.4 billion rupees ($7 billion) for air force procurements, budget documents showed.The country's defense spending, estimated at about 2% of GDP, is still lower than China's 1.45 trillion yuan ($230 billion) in allocations for 2022.rm/nm (AP, AFP, Reuters)",2023/02/01,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797551,"Drones for Ukraine, made in Germany","Ukraine will soon receive battle tanks as well as reconnaissance drones from Germany. Both decisions were announced on the same day last week — but news that Leopard 2 battle tanks would finally be delivered to the Ukrainian army eclipsed that of the drones. The announcement involved a young company, Quantum-Systems, which has received a large follow-up order for its Vector drones from the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense — paid for by the German government.The Vector reconnaissance drone has proven to be a true asset in the war in Ukraine. Kyiv ordered 33 of them early last August and has ordered another 105 since. But practical field tests predated that. Last spring, Quantum-Systems CEO and co-founder Florian Seibel told the German media that a Ukrainian billionaire had approached him to buy drones for his country's army, and that several other oligarchs followed his example.Vector drones were already in use in Ukraine at a time when many politicians in Germany still had serious doubts about the advisability of supplying weapons to Kyiv. Drones, however, are not weapons as such, which explains the rapid export approval granted by the German Ministry of Economic Affairs at the time. The electric vertical takeoff unmanned aerial vehicle (eVTOL UAV) in the shape of a propeller aircraft has a length of 1.63 meters (64 inches), a wingspan of 2.8 meters (110 inches), and is used for aerial reconnaissance. It has a flight duration of 120 minutes and can transmit video footage and data from a distance of up to 30 kilometers (18.6 miles), which is the range of many artillery weapons.The drones cost €180,000 ($195,600) each, which means the German government will be shelling out almost €20 million for the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense's follow-up order. When asked why the Vector is so expensive, Seibel told DW that it is actually in the lower price segment — and that Israeli and US military reconnaissance drones are significantly more expensive. ""There is simply a lot of military technology built in: special antennas, night vision devices, infrared cameras, tap-proof data links,"" he said, adding the software involves decades of development work, for instance concerning control and navigation.Seibel did not originally intend to supply the military. He first focused on the development, design and production of small UAVs for the commercial civilian sector. He had previously spent 16 years in the military, first as a helicopter pilot, then at the Bundeswehr University Munich, where he conducted research for his doctoral thesis at the Faculty of Aerospace Engineering. There, he met three other future company founders, patented the prototype of a drone with one of them — and dropped his doctorate plans. He launched the start-up Quantum-Systems in January 2015.Two years later, series production of the Trinity drone began. It was mainly used for land surveying and mapping agricultural and construction projects, including in Germany, Indonesia, Ghana and the US. It was used in Ukraine, too, first in the agricultural sector and then as part of a project in Chernobyl.Development of the dual-use Vector drone, which is designed for military use as well as by police, firefighters and border guards, began at Quantum-Systems in 2018. ""Of course, I couldn't have guessed that the Russians would invade all of Ukraine, even though they had already partly done so in Crimea in 2014,"" Seibel told DW. ""I just had the feeling that we in Europe were neglecting our security and should be more concerned about the issue.""Often something starts out as a military development and then finds its way into the civilian world, Seibel said. ""In this case, we took the opposite approach and made our commercial technology available to the military. They can learn to use our system with almost effortless ease within a few hours.""The Vector series went into production in 2020. Its spring 2022 deployment in Ukraine was its first ever military use, and that in a war zone. ""We, the West, must do everything we can to end this war as quickly as possible, but we can only force Russia to the negotiating table if the Russians see they are going to lose the war,"" the head of Quantum-Systems said, arguing that as long as they assume they can win, they will fight on.Deliveries to Ukraine have also sparked other militaries' interest in the reconnaissance drone. The Bundeswehr, the US army and the Dutch army have all placed orders.Some people in Germany might see Florian Seibel as a war profiteer. ""We are an economic winner of the war because we are making money by providing technology that is needed,"" conceded Seibel, who compared the situation with that of Germany's Biontech, which developed and marketed the world's most successful innovative vaccine against COVID in cooperation with US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer. Biontech, said Seibel, helped rid the world of a major health disaster, and it is only fair that the company's founders and the investors — who for years funded their work at their own risk — should be rewarded.Quantum-Systems is responsible to the investors who entrusted the young company with tens of millions of euros, Seibel said, adding that they include Bayern Kapital, the German state of Bavaria's investment company, which promotes the aerospace industry — in particular in the greater Munich area, where Quantum-Systems is located.In October 2022, Peter Thiel, a German-American tech investor and billionaire entrepreneur, decided to take a stake in the company as well. That came close to a knighthood, Seibel said. ""Peter Thiel is certainly one of the most successful, if not the most successful tech investor in the world, he was able to build a financial foundation with Paypal, thanks to which he then invested more, for instance in Facebook, where he was involved early on.""Seibel said he is aware of the fact that Thiel is a controversial political figure because of his support for Donald Trump and right-wing US Republicans. ""But it's not my job to discuss politics with him,"" the Quantum-Systems CEO argued. What matters is that ""Peter Thiel invested in a German drone company because he basically believes it can do something great.""As far as drone deliveries to the Ukrainian army are concerned, Quantum-Systems representatives are working on organizing maintenance on site in Ukraine to avoid having to bring them back to Germany.This article was originally written in German.",2023/02/01,109,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797552,Maryland Gov. Wes Moore emphasizes public service in speech,"ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) — Maryland Gov. Wes Moore emphasized commitment to public service in his first State of the State speech Wednesday, highlighting his proposal to create a service year program for high school graduates that he said will be the first of its kind in the nation.

            
                Moore, who is the state’s first Black governor, noted that the word “service” comes from the Latin word for “slavery.”

            “So, it’s fitting as the first African American in the state of Maryland to deliver this speech,” Moore said, pausing while lawmakers applauded, “standing in a building that was built by the hands of enslaved people, that we are now putting service ... towards the good of all. The irony is that it’s service that will help save us.”











            The new governor said he wants to promote service as a state ideal, telling legislators that he benefited because of people in his life “who stepped up even when they were not called.” He has set aside $18 million in the budget for a new Department of Service and Civic Innovation initiative — which will be a voluntary, service year program for high school graduates to better prepare them for future jobs. 

            “While our young people give back, they also lay the foundation for their future success through job training, through mentorship programs, and it creates a lifelong habit of service to our state — something we so desperately need,” Moore said. “Whether they’re preparing our state for the realities of climate change or tutoring our students, or caring for the sick, young people should have the option to perform important service today and build a foundation for our shared future.”

            Moore, a Democrat who has been in office for two weeks, pitched his legislative priorities to a General Assembly where Democrats hold strong majorities. His landslide victory in November brought an exuberant lift to Democrats, who had grown weary from the rare, two-term tenure of a Republican governor in a state where Democrats outnumber GOP voters 2-1.

            Moore entered office with the benefit of a large budget surplus, largely due to enormous federal COVID-19 pandemic relief. The governor’s $63.1 billion budget proposal, which is about 3% less than last year's budget, includes about $2.5 billion in the state’s rainy day fund, or about 10% of the state’s general fund. In addition, the state budget has a fund balance of $820 million.

            Speaking to a crowded room of legislators in the House of Delegates, Moore also focused on addressing childhood poverty. The former CEO of the national anti-poverty group called the Robin Hood Foundation has budgeted $171 million to permanently extend the earned income tax credit and to expand the child tax credit.

            The governor, who served as a paratrooper and captain in the U.S. Army in Afghanistan, also has set aside $33 million in his budget plan for tax relief for military retirees to encourage veterans to remain in Maryland. 

            During his speech, Moore introduced several guests to illustrate the need for the legislation he supports this session. One of them was Angela McCullough, a retired U.S. Air Force Master Sergeant, and the owner and CEO of Maryland-based consulting firm, Tri-Logistics. 

            “She’s an example of what our state needs more of,” Moore said. 

            The governor also called attention to a proposal to strengthen the pipeline of qualified teachers with a measure called the “Maryland Educator Shortage Act.” Moore said the measure will create new pathways to address the shortage of qualified teachers, giving students the mentors and leaders they need to explore the full range of opportunities in emerging sectors.

            Moore also said he wants to increase salaries to recruit and retain corrections and parole officers. He said his budget calls for more than $30 million to get the state more staff and resident advisors for juveniles. 

            Moore also wants to reach a $15 hourly minimum wage at a faster pace than the gradual increases approved by lawmakers in 2019 and index it for inflation. Under current law, the state won't reach $15 until 2025. The minimum wage rose to $13.25 last month.

            Moore also underscored the importance of his proposed salary increases for state employees — in order to make state government a more attractive place to work. He also wants to fill about half of the state’s 6,500 vacant positions in executive branch agencies.

            “This isn’t about creating big government,” Moore said. “This is about creating a better one.”ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) — Maryland Gov.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797553,DeSantis injects politics into $115B Florida budget proposal,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis promised tax relief Wednesday on children’s books, pet food and even the gas stoves that have become a rallying cry for Republicans while assuring that the state has plenty of reserves to withstand any economic downturn.

            He's also seeking another $12 million to prevent immigrants in the country illegally from arriving in Florida, similar to the money he spent to fly almost 50 migrants from Texas to Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, last year.

            DeSantis' annual state budget proposal outlined during a news conference in Tallahassee is nearly $115 billion, but is only a recommendation. The Legislature will approve a final budget during the annual session that begins next month.











            But DeSantis has proven he usually gets what he wants from the GOP-dominated Legislature, and he's likely to see little resistance from House and Senate leaders as the governor builds a case for a possible 2024 presidential run.

            And while DeSantis said he expects bad news for the national economy that will affect the state, he said Florida is in good shape.

            “When you have $15.7 billion in reserves, when you have $3.4 billion in your rainy day fund, you are prepared to be able to weather those types of storms,” DeSantis said. “We are built to be able to withstand that.”

            DeSantis also used the announcement to make political jabs. Republicans have expressed outrage since a study suggested gas stoves could cause health problems and some have questioned whether they should be banned, and DeSantis said liberals are coming after stoves.

            “It needs to be done — no tax permanently on gas stoves,” DeSantis said. “They want your gas stove and we're not going to let that happen.”

            DeSantis' use of the gas stove issue had Democrats rolling their eyes.

            “Is it really in there?” Democratic Sen. Jason Pizzo said about the gas stove sales tax, adding that calls to ban them have been a joke. “Nobody took that seriously. He has no sense of humor.”

            Democratic Rep. Kelly Skidmore also pointed out that DeSantis continues to use a nameless enemy (though presumably liberals) on culture war issues.

            “This is what the governor does. He pits people against each other. So who are ‘They?’ The conspiratorial they that want to take our gas stoves away, that want to indoctrinate our children ... the they that is the bogeyman d'jour,” she said. “It was completely silly.”

            And the ongoing effort to relocate immigrants is also a political move aimed at the Biden administration and one that will surely be a talking point during a presidential campaign.

            “We've had a deterrent effect,” DeSantis said. “People are sick of having an open border with no rule of law in this country, so we can just sit here and do nothing about it or we can actually stand up and say, ‘Whatever tools we have at our disposal, we’re going to use.'”

            DeSantis is also proposing to expand sales tax holidays for school supplies as well as pushing new sales tax holidays on household supplies that cost under $25, dental supplies, toiletries, pet food and on children's books, toys and athletic equipment.

            “This is going to be really, really good for families in Florida,” DeSantis said.

            If the Legislature agrees, state workers would get an across the board 5% raise and state jobs that are hard to fill or retain employees would see a bump of 10%.

            At this point in the process, the budget will change. DeSantis originally proposed nearly $100 billion for the current fiscal year but eventually signed a $110 billion spending plan. The final product will be approved by lawmakers and DeSantis can veto individual items.

            Skidmore did praise some elements in the budget proposal, saying it addresses needs like state worker pay and eliminating taxes on diapers and baby supplies that Democrats have been seeking for years.TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis promised tax relief Wednesday on children’s books, pet food and even the gas stoves that have become a rallying cry for Republicans while assuring that the state has plenty of reserves to withstand any economic downturn.He's also seeking another $12 million to prevent immigrants in the country illegally from arriving in Florida, similar to the money he spent to fly almost 50 migrants from Texas to Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, last year.DeSantis' annual state budget proposal outlined during a news conference in Tallahassee is nearly $115 billion, but is only a recommendation. The Legislature will approve a final budget during the annual session that begins next month.But DeSantis has proven he usually gets what he wants from the GOP-dominated Legislature, and he's likely to see little resistance from House and Senate leaders as the governor builds a case for a possible 2024 presidential run.And while DeSantis said he expects bad news for the national economy that will affect the state, he said Florida is in good shape.“When you have $15.7 billion in reserves, when you have $3.4 billion in your rainy day fund, you are prepared to be able to weather those types of storms,” DeSantis said. “We are built to be able to withstand that.”DeSantis also used the announcement to make political jabs. Republicans have expressed outrage since a study suggested gas stoves could cause health problems and some have questioned whether they should be banned, and DeSantis said liberals are coming after stoves.“It needs to be done — no tax permanently on gas stoves,” DeSantis said. “They want your gas stove and we're not going to let that happen.”DeSantis' use of the gas stove issue had Democrats rolling their eyes.“Is it really in there?” Democratic Sen. Jason Pizzo said about the gas stove sales tax, adding that calls to ban them have been a joke. “Nobody took that seriously. He has no sense of humor.”Democratic Rep. Kelly Skidmore also pointed out that DeSantis continues to use a nameless enemy (though presumably liberals) on culture war issues.“This is what the governor does. He pits people against each other. So who are ‘They?’ The conspiratorial they that want to take our gas stoves away, that want to indoctrinate our children ... the they that is the bogeyman d'jour,” she said. “It was completely silly.”And the ongoing effort to relocate immigrants is also a political move aimed at the Biden administration and one that will surely be a talking point during a presidential campaign.“We've had a deterrent effect,” DeSantis said. “People are sick of having an open border with no rule of law in this country, so we can just sit here and do nothing about it or we can actually stand up and say, ‘Whatever tools we have at our disposal, we’re going to use.'”DeSantis is also proposing to expand sales tax holidays for school supplies as well as pushing new sales tax holidays on household supplies that cost under $25, dental supplies, toiletries, pet food and on children's books, toys and athletic equipment.“This is going to be really, really good for families in Florida,” DeSantis said.If the Legislature agrees, state workers would get an across the board 5% raise and state jobs that are hard to fill or retain employees would see a bump of 10%.At this point in the process, the budget will change.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797555,O's-Nats TV dispute goes before NY's top court on March 14,"ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — The New York Court of Appeals has scheduled oral arguments for March 14 in the long-running dispute between the Baltimore Orioles and Washington Nationals over television rights fees.

            
                After agreeing in September 2021 to consider the case, the state's highest court said this week that it will hear arguments on the question of “whether courts have the power, after vacating an arbitration award based on 'evident partiality' related to the forum, to order rehearing in a forum other than that provided for in the parties’ arbitration agreement.""

            The Mid-Atlantic Sports Network was established in March 2005 after the Montreal Expos relocated to Washington and became the Nationals, moving into what had been Baltimore’s exclusive broadcast territory since 1972. The Orioles have a controlling interest in the network.











            MASN paid the Nationals for 2012-16 what the Orioles proposed: $197.5 million. Washington argued it should be paid $475 million.

            An arbitration panel of baseball executives — Pittsburgh Pirates President Frank Coonelly, Tampa Bay Rays principal owner Stuart Sternberg and New York Mets chief operating officer Jeff Wilpon — heard the case in 2012 and ruled in 2014 that the Nationals were owed $298.1 million.

            The Orioles appealed, and that decision was thrown out in 2015 by New York Supreme Court Justice Lawrence K. Marks, who ruled a law firm representing the Nationals was conflicted because it had worked for clubs of executives on the panel. The case was sent back to baseball to be heard by a reconstituted Revenue Sharing Definitions Committee.

            A second panel of baseball executives — Milwaukee Brewers chairman Mark Attanasio, Seattle Mariners President Kevin Mather and Toronto Blue Jays President Mark Shapiro — ordered a slightly lower payment of $296.8 million. That decision was confirmed in August 2019 by New York Supreme Court Justice Joel M. Cohen.

            The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court for the First Department unanimously affirmed Cohen’s decision in October 2020, ruling the Orioles failed to establish evident partiality in the second arbitration panel. The First Department’s decision was by Justices Dianne T. Renwick, Cynthia S. Kern, Saliann Scarpulla and Martin Shulman.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797556,Judge: Defiant NJ beach town can sue for $21M in dune costs,"CAPE MAY COURT HOUSE, N.J. (AP) — A New Jersey beach town that defied state environmental authorities and fixed its dunes that were seriously eroded by a storm can proceed with a lawsuit seeking to recover $21 million it spent bulking up its shoreline, but cannot build a bulkhead to permanently thwart the waves, a judge ruled Wednesday.

            Superior Court Judge Michael Blee issued a restraining order barring North Wildwood from building a bulkhead along a severely eroded section of its shoreline, as it has been threatening to do for months. The city defied the state Department of Environmental Protection and carried out emergency repairs to its beach in October after the remnants of Hurricane Ian chewed huge chunks out of protective sand dunes. 

            Blee also ordered the city to submit a new request to the DEP for authorization to do emergency repairs in light of what the city says are steadily deteriorating conditions on the beach, which officials say has lost 75% of its sand.











            But in what Mayor Patrick Rosenello viewed as a significant victory, the judge allowed North Wildwood to proceed with its own litigation against the state. The city wants to recoup the $21 million it has spent trucking in sand from neighboring beaches over the past decade while waiting for a federal and state beach replenishment project that most of the rest of the Jersey Shore has already gotten.

            “I'm very pleased, obviously,” Rosenello said after the judge's ruling. “We're going to have to go through the legal and administrative process and hopefully get to a good decision.”

            As it has since October, North Wildwood claimed Wednesday that parts of its beaches are at imminent risk of destruction in the next serious storm.

            “This is the most erosional site in the state of New Jersey,” said Anthony Bocchi, an attorney for North Wildwood. ""Conditions have only worsened in the four months since October. Yes, the dunes have not breached, by the grace of God. We are just lucky.""

            Kevin Terhune, a deputy attorney general representing the state, said the immediate danger ended when Ian left the area in October, and noted that the city's dire predictions have not come to pass.

            The DEP declined to comment on the judge's ruling. It previously said the work North Wildwood wants to do could actually make erosion worse, and would likely harm environmentally sensitive areas.

            In October, North Wildwood sought permission from the state to do emergency repair work on the beach, including construction of a bulkhead and the placement of temporary traffic-style barriers in front of its lifeguard headquarters building. The DEP allowed the temporary barriers but denied the other requested work.

            But North Wildwood did repairs anyway, including moving sand from one section of beach to another, which was forbidden by the state in the absence of a permit. And it has amassed building materials and construction equipment on the shoreline in case it won permission from the court to build a bulkhead, which remains off the table for now.

            The disagreement between North Wildwood and the state stretches back more than a decade. The state notes that North Wildwood continues to flout a 2020 order to restore 12 acres (5 hectares) of mature, vegetated dunes that were removed for a different unauthorized seawall project.

            While most of the Jersey Shore’s 127-mile (204-kilometer) coastline got replenished beaches in the years after Superstorm Sandy hit in 2012, North Wildwood has not. The city is part of a proposed multi-town federal and state beach replenishment project also involving Wildwood, Wildwood Crest and Lower Township.

            Numerous legal and real estate agreements must be finalized before that can happen, and that project likely can’t start until the fall of 2024 at the earliest, the state estimated in August.

            In the meantime, the city is keeping its collective fingers crossed.

            “If there is a moderate storm, it is over,” Bocchi told the judge. “There is zero beach left.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797557,Commanders talk to 49ers' Lynn for offensive coordinator job,"The Washington Commanders are interviewing Anthony Lynn for their offensive coordinator vacancy.

            The team confirmed the interview Wednesday. Lynn, the San Francisco 49ers assistant head coach/running backs coach, is the sixth candidate the Commanders have spoken to about the job.

            Coach Ron Rivera interviewed Lynn in person in California days after the 49ers flew home following their loss at Philadelphia in the NFC championship game. Rivera was criticized on social media Tuesday by Washington radio broadcasters for golfing at Pebble Beach before hiring an offensive coordinator.











            That process has been ongoing since Rivera fired Scott Turner on Jan. 10, less than 48 hours after the Commanders missed the playoffs with the NFL's 20th ranked offense. Turner's at times curious play-calling and underwhelming results with multiple quarterbacks contributed to derailing their postseason hopes.

            Lynn, 54, offers a deep resume after coaching the Los Angeles Chargers from 2017-20 and serving as offensive coordinator for the Detroit Lions in 2021 before joining San Francisco. The 49ers have already lost defensive coordinator DeMeco Ryans, who was hired by the Houston Texans as their next coach.

            Before Lynn, the Commanders interviewed former Denver Broncos offensive coordinator Pat Shurmur, current Washington quarterbacks coach Ken Zampese, Atlanta Falcons QB coach Charles London, Miami Dolphins associate head coach/RBs coach Eric Studesville and Los Angeles Rams assistant head coach/tight ends coach Thomas Brown.

            Rivera and general manager Martin Mayhew in their season-ending news conference said they preferred a run-first style of offense.

            “I think it's a philosophical belief,” Rivera said hours before firing Turner. ""If you look at a lot of the teams that do end up at the end where they are, most of them rush for well over 1,000 (yards). They control the tempo of the game, and I think that’s what we need to do to win football games.”

            Whoever gets the job could also inherit QB Sam Howell going into his second pro season. Howell made his NFL debut in the season finale, throwing and rushing for a touchdown in beating the playoff-bound Dallas Cowboys.

            “He was impressive,” Mayhew said. ""He got off to a really good start, and it’s going to be a lot of evaluation process for him, as well. We’ll see where it all shakes out.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797558,"Passengers disarm gunman who killed DC employee, shot others","WASHINGTON (AP) — A man “randomly” brandishing a firearm shot three people, killing one, in a Wednesday morning rampage in the nation's capital that started on a city bus and ended in a Metro tunnel after passengers attacked and disarmed him. 

            Authorities were still piecing together the chaotic series of events that left two people with gunshot wounds to the leg and Metro employee Robert Cunningham shot dead. The shooter is in police custody and has not been publicly identified.

            Metropolitan Police Department Executive Assistant Chief Ashan Benedict praised the “heroic actions of our citizens, our community, to disarm this shooter.""











            But he added, “The fact that our citizens had to intervene with armed gunmen is disturbing to me.”

            The violence began shortly after 9 a.m. when the man began brandishing a weapon and confronting passengers on a city bus in the southeast area of the city. The man pursued one of the passengers off the bus and shot them in the leg, Benedict said.

            The man then went down the escalator of the nearby Potomac Avenue Metro stop, confronted someone who was buying a Metro pass and shot that person in the leg as well. Both victims were recovering in local hospitals.

            The armed man then went down to the train platform and began confronting a woman there. Benedict characterized his behavior as deeply erratic, saying, “He’s walking around brandishing a firearm and just randomly engaging people in confrontation. He’s clearly agitated about something.” 

            At that point, Cunningham, a 64-year-old mechanic in Metro's power department, tried to intervene and was killed by a gunshot. A statement from Paul Smedberg, chair of the Metro board, said Cunningham “acted with extreme bravery to help a customer who was being threatened by the shooter.” 

            The armed man then attempted to board a Metro train and was apparently confronted and disarmed by the passengers. He exited the train car and was taken into custody by police officers, who recovered his weapon on the train tracks, Benedict said. 

            Mayor Muriel Bowser said the shootings highlight the need for serious gun control. Bowser and the Police Department have recently endured intense public pressure after a city employee shot and killed a 13-year old boy who was part of a group of youth breaking into parked cars on his block. The resident was charged this week with second-degree murder. 

            “We’re focused on how we get guns out of our city,” Bowser said. ""Whether it’s the Metro, it’s the street, it’s in individual homes, we know that we have guns that are creating tragedies in our city and in our nation.” 

            Metro General Manager Randy Clarke said his administration had recently beefed up security measures, including increased police patrols and video surveillance. But he said the morning's incident was indicative of a wider issue beyond Metro security.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797559,Justice Department: MLB antitrust exemption should be narrow,"NEW YORK (AP) — The U.S. Justice Department asked a federal appeals court to narrowly consider Major League Baseball’s antitrust exemption, a filing made in a case involving four eliminated minor league teams hoping to end the sport’s century-old legal protection.

            
                MLB cut the minimum guaranteed minor league affiliation agreements from 160 to 120 in September 2020 and took over running the minors from the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues, which had been in charge since 1901.

            The parent companies of the Staten Island Yankees, Tri-City ValleyCats, Salem-Keizer Volcanoes and Norwich Sea Unicorns sued MLB in December 2021 in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, alleging a violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act caused by “a horizontal agreement between competitors that has artificially reduced and capped output in the market for MiLB teams affiliated with MLB clubs.”











            The suit was dismissed in October by a judge who cited the antitrust exemption created by a 1922 U.S. Supreme Court decision involving the Federal League. The teams then asked the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to send the case onto the Supreme Court.

            “The court need not resolve the exemption’s precise contours,” the Justice Department wrote in a brief to the 2nd Circuit filed Monday by Assistant Attorney General Jonathan S. Kanter and several other lawyers. “The United States therefore does not take a position on whether the exemption applies here. Instead, the United States files this brief to reaffirm, as the Supreme Court has said, that courts should ‘not extend’ the Federal Baseball exemption.”

            After the case was filed, MLB moved to dismiss while citing the sport’s antritrust exemption, alleging lack of standing and claiming there was no antitrust violation.

            U.S. District Judge Andrew L. Carter ruled on Oct. 26 that the minor league teams had standing and “had pleaded sufficient facts to show an actual adverse effect on competition in the identified market.” But he dismissed the suit because of the antitrust exemption.

            “Plaintiffs believe that the Supreme Court is poised to knock out the exemption, like a boxer waiting to launch a left hook after her opponent tosses out a torpid jab,” Carter wrote. “It’s possible. But until the Supreme Court or Congress takes action, the exemption survives; it shields MLB from plaintiffs’ lawsuit.”

            The Supreme Court granted baseball an antitrust exemption in the Federal League case when Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote that baseball was not interstate commerce but exhibitions exempt from antitrust laws. The Supreme Court reaffirmed the decision in a 1953 case involving New York Yankees farmhand George Toolson and in the 1972 Curt Flood decision, saying any changes should come from Congress.

            A 1998 law applied antitrust laws to MLB affecting the employment of major league players at the major league level.

            “This court must, of course, apply controlling precedent even when it is wrong,” the minor league teams wrote in a Jan. 9 brief to the 2nd Circuit. “But the court should, if it sees fit, dispatch this case to the Supreme Court with a message attached: Enough already.”

            ___

            AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_SportNEW YORK (AP) — The U.S. Justice Department asked a federal appeals court to narrowly consider Major League Baseball’s antitrust exemption, a filing made in a case involving four eliminated minor league teams hoping to end the sport’s century-old legal protection.MLB cut the minimum guaranteed minor league affiliation agreements from 160 to 120 in September 2020 and took over running the minors from the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues, which had been in charge since 1901.The parent companies of the Staten Island Yankees, Tri-City ValleyCats, Salem-Keizer Volcanoes and Norwich Sea Unicorns sued MLB in December 2021 in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, alleging a violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act caused by “a horizontal agreement between competitors that has artificially reduced and capped output in the market for MiLB teams affiliated with MLB clubs.”The suit was dismissed in October by a judge who cited the antitrust exemption created by a 1922 U.S. Supreme Court decision involving the Federal League. The teams then asked the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to send the case onto the Supreme Court.“The court need not resolve the exemption’s precise contours,” the Justice Department wrote in a brief to the 2nd Circuit filed Monday by Assistant Attorney General Jonathan S. Kanter and several other lawyers. “The United States therefore does not take a position on whether the exemption applies here. Instead, the United States files this brief to reaffirm, as the Supreme Court has said, that courts should ‘not extend’ the Federal Baseball exemption.”After the case was filed, MLB moved to dismiss while citing the sport’s antritrust exemption, alleging lack of standing and claiming there was no antitrust violation.U.S. District Judge Andrew L. Carter ruled on Oct. 26 that the minor league teams had standing and “had pleaded sufficient facts to show an actual adverse effect on competition in the identified market.” But he dismissed the suit because of the antitrust exemption.“Plaintiffs believe that the Supreme Court is poised to knock out the exemption, like a boxer waiting to launch a left hook after her opponent tosses out a torpid jab,” Carter wrote. “It’s possible. But until the Supreme Court or Congress takes action, the exemption survives; it shields MLB from plaintiffs’ lawsuit.”The Supreme Court granted baseball an antitrust exemption in the Federal League case when Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote that baseball was not interstate commerce but exhibitions exempt from antitrust laws. The Supreme Court reaffirmed the decision in a 1953 case involving New York Yankees farmhand George Toolson and in the 1972 Curt Flood decision, saying any changes should come from Congress.A 1998 law applied antitrust laws to MLB affecting the employment of major league players at the major league level.“This court must, of course, apply controlling precedent even when it is wrong,” the minor league teams wrote in a Jan. 9 brief to the 2nd Circuit. “But the court should, if it sees fit, dispatch this case to the Supreme Court with a message attached: Enough already.”___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sport",2023/02/02,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797560,"College stars to NBA? Scoring is great, but can he defend?","Max Abmas of Oral Roberts won the NCAA scoring title as a sophomore, averaging 24.5 points and he helped his team become just the second No. 15 seed in history to reach the Sweet 16.

            He's been among the national scoring leaders the last two seasons as well, with his 22-point average this year near the top of Division I.

            His resume, like those of several top players in the college ranks this season, looks great. But is it NBA worthy? That's where the Rockwell, Texas, native has much proving to do, and he's not alone. A number of players with eye-catching numbers may or may not move on to the top league in the world.











            At just 6 feet tall and 175 pounds, Abmas would be among the smallest guards in the NBA, so showing he can defend as well as score will be a necessity.

            “The size aspect can make me an underdog for sure, but that’s kind of something that I’ve dealt with my whole life, even coming out of high school and not being really highly recruited,” Abmas said. “A lot of coaches probably thought that I was too small.”

            How it shakes out could force Abmas to execute Plan B: He is getting a degree in biomedical engineering with designs on pursuing a career in forensics after his playing career.

            JAKE STEPHENS, 7-0, 275, Chattanooga

            A four-year starter at VMI, this graduate student stands apart from other bigs on draft boards because he is an “unbelievable shooter” from 3-point range, according to Ryan Blake, director of scouting for the NBA. Stephens has made 42 3s this season on 41% shooting, and he also averages 2.35 blocks and 10.2 rebounds.

            “The problem is he’s not that mobile,” Blake said, which could make teams concerned that he wouldn’t be able to hold his own against athletic big men on the defensive end. “He’s so smart and he can pass the ball. If he had really good athleticism, he’d be a lottery pick.""

            DREW TIMME, 6-10, 235, Gonzaga

            An AP All-American the past two seasons, Timme has been a major reason why No. 12 Gonzaga has lived near the top of the rankings. He averages 21.4 points and shoots 61%, but doesn’t shoot many 3s (2 of 18) and is not a dominant rebounder (7.5 rpg) even in the mediocre West Coast Conference.

            What he does have, though, is a high basketball IQ and a knack for stepping up at crunch time.

            “You look take a circle graph and you chart all those things,” Blake said. “The guy knows how to play. He can score. He can defend, but can he defend on the next level? Can he defend against stronger and quicker players? Those are going to be the questions that have to be answered and that’s probably why he hasn’t left yet.”

            Timme's endorsement earning are thought to be at least close to the $200,000-$500,000 NBA rookies can earn on two-way contracts.

            Timme could return to the Zags again next season thanks to the NCAA giving every player from the COVID-19 years an option for an extra year. His projected position in the draft could be key because contracts for first-round picks are guaranteed; second-round contracts are not.

            ANTOINE DAVIS, 6-1, 165, Detroit Mercy

            This season's NCAA scoring leader (26 per game) broke Fletcher Magee of Wofford's Division I record of 509 career 3-pointers, and then broke John Grotberg of Grinnell's all-division mark of 526.

            As of Wednesday, Davis has 534 3s and stands second on the NCAA scoring list with 3,332 career points, second to Pete Maravich of LSU (3,667).

            Maravich set his mark in just three seasons: Davis is in his fifth year with at least nine games left and would need to average more than 37 points to catch Maravich.

            “He can shoot. He can score. He's a coach's son. A lot of qualities,” Blake said of the 6-1 son of Titans' coach Mike Davis. ""I like the kid. He will be a guy that can be more of a playmaker, distributor, defender.""

            Davis seems to have the tools — he and Keydren Clark of Saint Peter's are the only players in history with 3,000 points and 500 assists.

            PROVING GROUND

            Blake and his staff invite 64 players to the three-day Portsmouth Invitational in Virginia. Not the can’t-miss players eligible for the draft, the invitees are those who warrant a closer look against better competition.

            The four-day, 12-game tournament in April is attended by scouts from the NBA and international leagues. Organizers guarantee that at least five players will then be invited to the NBA’s Chicago combine, where many of the top players in the draft pool compete against each other.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797562,Vessel strike blamed for humpback whale's death in New York,"LIDO BEACH, N.Y. (AP) — A humpback whale that washed ashore on a New York beach this week was likely killed by a vessel, federal authorities said Wednesday.

            A necropsy will determine the exact cause of death for the whale, a male named Luna that was more than 40 years old and had been tracked by marine biologists for decades, said officials with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

            The whale was discovered Monday morning at Lido Beach West Town Park on Long Island and was hauled up to the beach with a crane.











            A necropsy team including representatives from the Atlantic Marine Conservation Society, NOAA Fisheries, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, the Mystic Aquarium Animal Response Program and the Marine Mammal Stranding Center assembled Tuesday and cut through the blubber to collect samples of the whale's internal organs, NOAA officials said in a statement.

            The whale was likely killed by a vessel strike, the officials said, but more will be known once the results of the samples become available.

            Officials said the whale's level of decomposition indicated that it had died several days before washing ashore, contradicting early reports that the animal had beached itself while it was alive.

            The whale was about 41 feet (12 meters) long and weighed 29,000 pounds (13,154 kilos), the officials said.

            NOAA, which is responsible for the nation’s oceans and fisheries, says 19 humpback whales were stranded last year along the U.S. Atlantic coast. During the first month of this year, there have already been seven of the whales beached from Maine to Florida.LIDO BEACH, N.Y.

            José Rubén Nava was replaced as director of the local zoo in the city of Chilpancingo on Jan. 12 following the death of a deer there. 

            But officials said Tuesday that an investigation found some of the animals in the zoo’s collection had allegedly been sold off, traded or eaten under Nava’s orders. 











            The state environment department said a zebra was traded for tools and deer and Watusi cattle were traded off to private individuals, without proper accounting.

            It was not clear if Nava had been formally charged in the case, or if he had a lawyer.

            But the most shocking accusation was made by Fernando Ruiz Gutierrez, the state environment department's director of wildlife. He said Nava had four of the zoo's male pygmy goats killed and cooked for an end-of-year banquet.

            “These four animals slaughtered and cooked on the zoo's premises, and were served as food at the year-end party,” Ruiz Gutierrez said.

            “This put the health of the people who ate them at risk, because these animals were not fit for human consumption,” he said.

            Nava also allegedly traded the zoo's zebra for some tools needed to fix things around the zoo, but an inspection did not locate any such tools at the facility.

            Mexico has long had a problem with private citizens illegally acquiring exotic animals. For years, drug traffickers in Mexico have been known to build private menageries of lions, tigers and other wild animals. They sometimes escape, sowing panic. 

            In the central city of Aguascalientes, state police said a loose lion attacked and seriously injured a woman on the patio of her home. The lion apparently escaped from a nearby home. The woman was hospitalized with injuries to her legs, skull and a lung.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797566,Cremonese pulls off another Italian Cup shock to beat Roma,"MILAN (AP) — Hapless in Serie A, Cremonese pulled off another shock in the Italian Cup on Wednesday by beating Roma 2-1 to reach the semifinals for only the second time in its history — and the first in 36 years.

            Last-place Cremonese, without a win in the league, followed up its cup victory at Napoli in the last round by eliminating José Mourinho’s Roma.

            It will face Fiorentina in its first semifinal since 1987. The other semifinal pits holder Inter Milan against either Juventus or Lazio.











            Cremonese's win at Napoli was coach Davide Ballardini’s first match in charge and he followed that up with a draw at Bologna and a narrow loss to Inter in Serie A.

            Wednesday's match at Rome's Stadio Olimpico was Cremonese’s first quarterfinal since 1997 but the players didn’t let the occasion get to them and impressed from the start.

            Roma defender Marash Kumbulla was partly to blame for the opener, however, as he took too long on the ball, allowing Cyriel Dessers to steal it off him on the halfway line and sprint downfield into the area where he was brought down by goalkeeper Rui Patrício.

            Dessers dusted himself down and fired a precise penalty into the top left corner to give the visitors a 28th-minute lead.

            Mourinho rang the changes at halftime but Cremonese doubled its advantage four minutes after the break. David Okereke raced down the right flank and rolled the ball across for Charles Pickel, who tried to flick it on to Frank Tsadjout but it was deflected into his own net by Roma defender Mehmet Çelik to send the 200 traveling fans wild.

            Andrea Belotti pulled one back for Roma in the fourth minute of stoppage time.

            JOY FOR JOVIC

            Fiorentina avenged its league loss Torino by beating it 2-1 in the quarterfinals.

            After chances for both teams in Florence, the breakthrough was made in the 65th minute. A corner was taken short to Aleksa Terzić, who whipped in a cross for Luka Jović to head in at the far post.

            Jonathan Ikoné sealed the result — and a place in the final four — with a fine strike into the bottom right corner in the final minute after good work from Arthur Cabral.

            Cabral also hit the crossbar in stoppage time before Yann Karamoh pulled one back for Torino to set up a nervy final three minutes.

            Torino had won 1-0 at Fiorentina in Serie A less than two weeks ago.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797567,"Biden, McCarthy meet face-to-face on debt crisis worries","WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy met face-to-face Wednesday for more than an hour of highly anticipated budget talks — ""a good first meeting,"" the new Republican leader said — but expectations were low for quick progress as GOP lawmakers push for steep cuts in a deal to prevent a national debt limit crisis.

            Biden has resisted direct spending negotiations linked to vital action raising the nation's legal debt ceiling, warning against potentially throwing the economy into chaos.

            McCarthy had all but invited himself to the White House to start the conversation before a summer debt deadline. And he emerged saying the meeting went better than expected: The two agreed to meet again, and the speaker said he expected to hear from Biden soon.











            “No agreement, no promises except we will continue this conversation,” McCarthy told reporters outside the White House. 

            He said he told the president he would not raise the debt ceiling without concessions from Democrats.

            “I was very clear,"" he said. “We’re not spending more next year than we spent this year.”

            And Biden's response? McCarthy said the president insisted on a “clean debt ceiling” vote without the budget cuts Republicans are demanding.

            “We both have different perspectives on this, but I thought this was a good meeting,” McCarthy said. 

            The White House said the president and the speaker agreed to continue the conversation. The president made clear that it is their “shared duty” to not allow a “catastrophic default,” the White House said.

            The House speaker arrived for the afternoon session carrying no formal GOP budget proposal, but he is laden with the promises he made to far-right and other conservative Republican lawmakers during his difficult campaign to become House speaker. He vowed then to work to return federal spending to 2022 levels — an 8% reduction. He also promised to take steps to balance the budget within the decade — an ambitious, if politically unattainable goal.

            McCarthy said he told the president, ""I would like to see if we can come to an agreement long before the deadline.”

            The political and economic stakes are high for both leaders, who have a cordial relationship, and for the nation as they work to prevent a debt default.

            Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen notified Congress last month that the government was reaching the limit of its borrowing capacity, $31 trillion, with congressional approval needed to raise the ceiling to allow more debt to pay off the nation’s already accrued bills. While Yellen was able to launch “extraordinary measures” to cover the bills temporarily, that funding is to run out in June.

            “Everyone is asking the same question of Speaker McCarthy: Show us your plan. Where is your plan, Republicans?” said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., ahead of the meeting.

            ""For days, Speaker McCarthy has heralded this sitdown as some kind of major win in his debt ceiling talks,"" Schumer said. But he added, “Speaker McCarthy showing up at the White House without a plan is like sitting down at the table without cards in your hand.”

            Raising the debt ceiling is a once-routine vote in Congress that has taken on oversized significance over the past decade as the nation's debt toll mounts. Newly empowered in the majority, House Republicans want to force Biden and Senate Democrats into budget cuts as part of a deal to raise the limit.

            Ahead of the White House meeting, House Republicans met in private to discuss policies. And McCarthy met with Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday at the Capitol. 

            McConnell has a history of dealmaking with Biden during the last debt ceiling showdown a decade ago. But the GOP leader of the Senate, in the minority party, says it's up to McCarthy and the president to come up with a deal that would be acceptable to the new House majority.

            Still, McConnell is doing his part to influence the process from afar, and nudging Biden to negotiate.

            “The president of the United States does not get to walk away from the table,” McConnell said in Senate remarks.

            Slashing the federal budget is often easier said than done, as past budget deals have shown.

            After a 2011 debt ceiling standoff during the Obama era, Republicans and Democrats agreed to across-the-board federal budget caps on domestic and defense spending that were supposed to be in place for 10 years but ultimately proved too much to bear.

            After initial cuts, both parties agreed in subsequent years to alter the budget caps to protect priority programs. The caps recently expired anyway, and last year Congress agreed to a $1.7 trillion federal spending bill that sparked new outrage among fiscal hawks.

            McCarthy reiterated that he would not be proposing any reductions to the Social Security and Medicare programs that are primarily for older Americans. But other Republicans want cuts to those as part of overall belt-tightening.

            Such mainstay programs, along with the Medicaid health care system, make up the bulk of federal spending and are politically difficult to cut, particularly with a growing population of those in need of services in congressional districts nationwide.

            Agreeing on the size and scope of the GOP’s proposed cuts will be a tall order for McCarthy as he struggles to build consensus within his narrow House Republican majority and bridge the divide between his conservative and far-right wings of the party.

            McCarthy told reporters he's not counting on Republican support alone and wants Democratic help to pass a deal in Congress. But relying on a bipartisan approach could bring a revolt from McCarthy's hard-right flank of lawmakers who can threaten to oust him from his speakership.

            After Wednesday morning's closed-door House GOP briefing, several Republican lawmakers insisted they would not allow the negotiations to spiral into a debt crisis.

            “Obviously, we don’t want to default on our debt. We’re not going to,” said Rep. Warren Davidson, R-Ohio. “But we are going to have to have a discussion about the trajectory that we're on. Everyone knows that it’s not sustainable.”

            Rep. Kevin Hern of Oklahoma, chairman of the Republican Study Committee, held a separate briefing for his group, whose 175 or so members make up most of the House GOP majority. 

            Hern sent a letter to McCarthy outlining their principles for budget cuts ahead of the White House meeting.

            The federal budget's non-mandatory programs, in defense and domestic accounts, have also proven tough to trim.

            Fast bowler Jofra Archer, playing in his first international series for two years, took 6-40 and blew through South Africa's top and middle order to carry England to its 59-run win in Kimberley. Archer fittingly finished it off by bowling Tabraiz Shamsi.

            South Africa was all out for 287 chasing England's 346-7.











            
                South Africa had already won the series after taking a 2-0 lead and while the victory in the final game of the series was a consolation for England, it had repercussions for South Africa.

            South Africa is still outside of the automatic qualifying places for the 50-over World Cup in India this year and needs every win it can get. The Proteas have two ODIs left against the Netherlands to clinch automatic qualification. England is already assured of a place at the World Cup.

            England built its daunting total in Kimberley through a magnificent partnership of 232 for the fourth wicket between Buttler and Malan.

            Opener Malan made 118 off 114 balls and Buttler hit 131 off 127 to turn England's innings around after Jason Roy (1), Ben Duckett (0) and Harry Brook (6) all went cheaply.

            From 14-3, England had surged to 246-4 by the time the partnership was broken when Malan miscued a slog high in the air and was caught by wicketkeeper Heinrich Klaasen.

            Moeen Ali cracked 41 from 28 at the end to help England to the highest ODI total at Kimberley by some way, surpassing the 304-5 Sri Lanka got in 2012.

            With South Africa resting top fast bowlers Kagiso Rabada and Anrich Nortje, Lungi Ngidi put in the best performance with the ball for the Proteas with 4-62.

            South Africa wasn't able to maintain the rate needed to win and Archer, who returned for England in the first game of the series after a long absence with elbow and back injuries, made all the meaningful breakthroughs.

            He removed Rassie van der Dussen, Aiden Markram, dangerman David Miller and top-scorer Heinrich Klaasen (80) in his six wickets as England won comfortably this time after letting dominant positions slip in the first two games of the series.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797581,Adani scraps $2.5B share sale after fraud claims hit stock,"NEW DELHI (AP) — Embattled Indian billionaire Gautam Adani said Thursday his conglomerate will review its plans for raising capital after calling off his flagship company’s $2.5 billion share offering following the loss of tens of billions of dollars in market value due to claims of fraud by a U.S.-based short-selling firm. 

            Adani Enterprises canceled the share sale late Wednesday, citing “market volatility.” Stocks in the coal mines to ports empire sank after Hindenburg Research, which has a track record of sending stock prices of its targets tumbling, accused the group of “brazen” stock market manipulation and accounting fraud, among other financial abuses. 

            The share sale was seen as a crucial test of investor confidence in Adani, whose net worth shot up about 2,000% in recent years as share prices for his listed companies soared.











            By the time trading closed Wednesday, Adani Enterprises was down by a whopping 28%. But the share offering had drawn nearly 51 million bids, exceeding the 45.5 million offered to the public. Stock in six of Adani’s other listed companies sank between 2% and 19%.

            Early Thursday, Adani Enterprises was down by 5%. Stocks in four of Adani’s other listed companies were down by 10% and two others sunk between 5% and 8%. 

            In a video address Thursday, Adani said the decision to scrap the share offering was made “to insulate the investors from potential losses.”

            “For me, the interest of my investors is paramount and everything else is secondary,” he said.

            Adani Enterprises said in a statement that it would withdraw the transaction and return the money to its investors. The decision would not “have any impact on our existing operations and future plans,” it said, adding that the group’s balance sheet was “very healthy” with strong cashflows and secure assets.

            Adani made a vast fortune mining coal as energy-hungry India grew swiftly after its economy was liberalized in the 1990s. Adani companies operate airports in major cities, build roads, generate electricity, manufacture defense equipment, develop agricultural drones, sell cooking oil and run a media outlet. 

            Hindenburg said it was betting against the group, accusing it of “pulling the largest con in corporate history.” It said it judged the seven key Adani listed companies to have an “85% downside, purely on a fundamental basis owing to sky-high valuations.”

            Most of the allegations involved concerns about the group’s debt levels, activities of top executives, use of offshore shell companies to artificially boost share prices and past investigations into fraud. It listed 88 questions for the group to answer.

            Adani Group dismissed Hindenburg’s allegations, and called its report a “calculated attack on India, the independence, integrity and quality of Indian institutions, and the growth story and ambition of India.” On Sunday, it issued a 413-page report that rejected its questions, saying none were “based on independent or journalistic fact finding.”

            Adani’s response included documents and data tables. It said the group has made all necessary regulatory disclosures and abided by local laws.

            The stock losses on Wednesday cost Adani his title as the richest man in Asia and in India. Adani also slid from a ranking of being the world’s third richest man to the 13th as his fortune plummeted to $72 billion, according to Bloomberg’s Billionaire Index.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797582,Unheralded group of Chiefs get redemption in Super Bowl hunt,"KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — The Kansas City Chiefs have some of the biggest names in the NFL, from Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce to Chris Jones and JuJu Smith-Schuster, yet they're playing in their third Super Bowl in four years largely because they refused to give up on players only their most-passionate fans know about.

            There’s the quartet of rookie defensive backs that were picked on all season, but who largely shut down Ja’Marr Chase and the Bengals' other talented wide receivers while picking off Joe Burrow twice in the AFC championship game.

            There's Skyy Moore, their fumble-prone rookie punt returner whose fumble cost them a win in Indianapolis in Week 3, but whose big return in the waning seconds Sunday night helped to set up the winning field goal in the 23-20 victory.











            And there's their kicker, Harrison Butker, whose sprained ankle in the regular-season opener in Arizona led to the most inaccurate season of his career, yet who drilled the 45-yarder with 3 seconds left that ultimately sent the Chiefs back to the desert.

            “Really, those are the redemption stories that you get into,” Chiefs coach Andy Reid said. “It was quite a deal to watch.”

            Indeed, Reid has been around long enough to understand the unforgiving nature of the NFL, where players' careers are often measured in weeks rather than years. He's seen hundreds with promise flame out, their chances at making it big done in by fumble problems, blown blocking assignments, missed tackles or other seemingly minor miscues.

            He likes to say that the line between success and failure is so small that it's almost imperceptible.

            His players understand that, too.

            “With the circumstances so high,” Chiefs offensive tackle Orlando Brown Jr. admitted, “the margin of error is so slim.”

            So nobody would have batted an eye had the Chiefs relegated Moore to the mothballs earlier in the season, when the first-year wide receiver couldn't even make a fair catch. To be fair, Moore had never really been put in that position, but that did not stop fans from groaning every time he fumbled a punt.

            The Chiefs finally pulled him from return duties, at least during games. But Moore continued to work in practice, and it wound up paying off. Their new returner, Kadarius Toney, hurt his ankle against the Bengals, and his backup Justin Watson already was inactive with an illness. So, the Chiefs sent Moore back to fetch the biggest punt of the season.

            He not only fielded it cleanly but raced up the sideline to give Kansas City a chance to win the AFC title in regulation.

            “I just had to remind myself who I was and why I was here,” Moore said. ""I was doing something new, and I was going to take my bumps and bruises. I just kept working at it. I didn’t think I was ever going to get a punt return again this season. But I didn’t stop catching punts. I was prepared for that moment and it paid off.”

            So did the decision by the Chiefs to keep putting rookie cornerbacks Trent McDuffie, Jaylen Watson and Josh Williams on the field together, often with rookie safety Bryan Cook, even as wily wide receivers kept beating them and flags kept flying for pass interference. Much like Moore, they took their lumps early in the season so they would be ready later.

            In the AFC title game, Watson and Williams both picked off passes, one of them after Cook batted the ball in the air.

            “They told us we were going to be a big part of this defense. They threw us in the fire,"" Williams said. ""They definitely gave us every piece of information and every detail to prepare us to play well in tight situations. They didn’t just tell us to go out there and play. They gave us a game plan and showed us how to execute. We did that and we bought in.”

            Butker was a slightly different case. His ankle injury in the opener in Arizona not only caused him to miss three weeks, it also forced him to alter his approach to kickoffs and field goals. The result was a shaky season in which the veteran kicker with the big leg missed a career-worst six field-goal attempts and blew three extra points.

            Yet when Moore's punt return gave Patrick Mahomes and Co. the ball, and the All-Pro quarterback scrambled into field-goal range on his own sprained ankle, the Chiefs had confidence enough in Butker to send him trotting onto the field.

            It was frigid. The wind was swirling. The ball probably felt like a rock. And yet Butker managed to get just enough oomph on the 45-yarder that it squeaked over the crossbar and gave the Chiefs their third AFC title in four years.

            “You dream about the big kicks. That’s what people remember,"" Butker pointed out in the jubilant Kansas City locker room afterward. ""They don’t remember your field-goal percentage during the year.”

            Nor do folks remember the adversity that players such as Moore, Butker and the Chiefs' rookie defensive backfield have faced when they suddenly find themselves playing in the Super Bowl.

            “Everybody pushed through and made it work,"" Reid said, “so I'm very proud for our guys.”

            AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFLKANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — The Kansas City Chiefs have some of the biggest names in the NFL, from Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce to Chris Jones and JuJu Smith-Schuster, yet they're playing in their third Super Bowl in four years largely because they refused to give up on players only their most-passionate fans know about.There’s the quartet of rookie defensive backs that were picked on all season, but who largely shut down Ja’Marr Chase and the Bengals' other talented wide receivers while picking off Joe Burrow twice in the AFC championship game.There's Skyy Moore, their fumble-prone rookie punt returner whose fumble cost them a win in Indianapolis in Week 3, but whose big return in the waning seconds Sunday night helped to set up the winning field goal in the 23-20 victory.And there's their kicker, Harrison Butker, whose sprained ankle in the regular-season opener in Arizona led to the most inaccurate season of his career, yet who drilled the 45-yarder with 3 seconds left that ultimately sent the Chiefs back to the desert.“Really, those are the redemption stories that you get into,” Chiefs coach Andy Reid said. “It was quite a deal to watch.”Indeed, Reid has been around long enough to understand the unforgiving nature of the NFL, where players' careers are often measured in weeks rather than years. He's seen hundreds with promise flame out, their chances at making it big done in by fumble problems, blown blocking assignments, missed tackles or other seemingly minor miscues.He likes to say that the line between success and failure is so small that it's almost imperceptible.His players understand that, too.“With the circumstances so high,” Chiefs offensive tackle Orlando Brown Jr. admitted, “the margin of error is so slim.”So nobody would have batted an eye had the Chiefs relegated Moore to the mothballs earlier in the season, when the first-year wide receiver couldn't even make a fair catch.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797584,Youth hailed as hero in icy pond rescue dies in shooting,"DREXEL HILL, Pa. (AP) — A Philadelphia-area teenager hailed as a hero for helping to rescue three children from an icy pond last year has died in an apparent accidental shooting over the weekend, authorities said.

            Police in Upper Darby said a group of teenagers and young adults were in a Drexel Hill apartment at about 5 p.m. Sunday when a gunshot fatally wounded 17-year-old Anthony Alexander of Collingdale Borough. A 16-year-old Collingdale youth who surrendered the next day faces third-degree murder, involuntary manslaughter, weapons and other charges in Delaware county and was being held in lieu of 10% of a $750,000 bail. 

            Investigators said in an affidavit of probable cause that the youth told police the teens had been live-streaming themselves on Instagram in the apartment while “passing around” two handguns when one of them went off, striking Alexander. His attorney declined comment on the charges Wednesday.











            “He was a beautiful child, and this is still not real for me,” Alexander’s stepmother, Ava Alexander, told The Philadelphia Inquirer on Tuesday. “He saw the good in everybody, and he would always come to someone’s defense.”

            On the afternoon of Feb. 21, 2022, then-16-year-old Anthony Alexander was in Collingdale Park when he heard screams coming from two girls and a boy who had fallen through the ice. He tried to use a stick to save them before going into the water himself and rescuing them. He was later honored along with police who assisted by the borough council.

            Alexander was to be honored next month with a Citizen Honors award in the Young Hero category of the Congressional Medal of Honor Society. “He will continue to be the solo Young Hero awardee” at the March 25 ceremony in Washington, said Kathleen Blomquist, the organization's executive director of communication.

            Family members said Alexander had been looking forward to the trip and was eager to meet the Medal of Honor recipients who would have hung the medal around his neck, the Inquirer reported. The Academy Park junior loved football, basketball and karate and hoped to enlist in the Marine Corps, his stepmother said.

            “We have to do something about the gun violence,” Ava Alexander told the newspaper, holding back tears, “because we cannot afford to keep losing our teenagers.”DREXEL HILL, Pa.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797585,"Disbarred, bankrupt lawyer Girardi charged with client theft","LOS ANGELES (AP) — Disgraced ex-lawyer Tom Girardi, once celebrated for winning massive settlements, has been indicted by federal grand juries in Los Angeles and Chicago on charges he stole more than $18 million from clients, prosecutors announced Wednesday.

            The charges are the latest legal blow to a once-powerful player who rubbed elbows with politicians and celebrities. As one of the nation’s most prominent plaintiff’s attorneys, Girardi was known for high-profile litigation such as the case that led to a $333 million settlement portrayed in the movie “Erin Brockovich.”

            With a weekly radio show called “Champions of Justice,” Girardi stood up to large corporations on behalf of people harmed by pollution, medical products and automobiles. At the same time, however, he was robbing some of those clients, Los Angeles U.S. Attorney Martin Estrada said at a news conference.











            “He claimed to be fighting for those less fortunate,” Estrada said. “But our investigation has revealed that behind this public persona, (he was) committing fraud on a massive of scale."" 

            The schemes included swindling a Los Angeles couple whose son was paralyzed in a car wreck, an Arizona widow whose husband died when a boat unexpectedly sped up to 120 miles per hour (193 kilometers per hour) and flipped, and family members of victims in a 2018 Lion Air crash that killed 189 people, according to the indictments.

            Girardi, 83, who once played a supporting role on “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills,” which starred his now-estranged wife Erika Jayne, was disbarred last summer for siphoning client funds. His Los Angeles firm Girardi Keese is bankrupt and he’s said to be suffering from dementia and is under a court conservatorship.

            U.S. prosecutors in Chicago said Girardi, his attorney son-in-law and their firm's chief financial officer took funds for five clients who reached settlements with Boeing, the makers of the 737 Max operated by Indonesia’s Lion Air that crashed into the Java Sea on Oct. 29, 2018 and killed 189 people.

            “The substantial misappropriation alleged in this indictment compounded the grief and anguish of the clients who lost loved ones in the Lion Air crash,” said John Lausch, the U.S. attorney for the northern district of Illinois.

            A Chicago law firm involved in the Lion Air case filed a racketeering lawsuit last year alleging that Girardi and his associates essentially ran a Ponzi scheme, siphoning off $100 million from their clients, attorneys they worked with and others.

            “The real story is one that seems like a tale out of a John Grisham novel: Girardi Keese was little more than a criminal enterprise, disguised as a law firm,” according to the lawsuit filed in Los Angeles by the Edelson law firm. “Indeed, the Girardi Keese firm operated what we now know was the largest criminal racketeering enterprise in the history of plaintiffs’ law.""

            Girardi made his name, and his money, taking on powerful corporations and public institutions, including Hollywood’s major movie studios, Lockheed, The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority and Pacific Gas and Electric in a case that inspired “Erin Brockovich,” the 2000 Julia Roberts film about a California desert community whose water has been poisoned. Girardi served as an adviser on the Oscar-winning flick.

            “That particular case revolutionized people’s thinking about all the toxic things they are exposed to,” he told Attorney at Law magazine in 2015.

            Girardi married Jayne in 2000. She became a member of the cast of “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills,” on which he made several appearances. He spent considerable money funding her unsuccessful musical career.

            Jayne filed for divorce in 2020.

            While Girardi's legal and financial woes only surfaced publicly in the past few years, clients filed more than 200 complaints against him over four decades, The State Bar of California revealed in November. Nearly 60% of complaints were about accounts set up to safeguard client funds. 

            Until he was disbarred in June, he had never been publicly disciplined. 

            Ruben Duran, the chair of the bar’s board of trustees, issued a mea culpa over “serious failures” in its discipline system. 

            “There is no excuse being offered here,” Duran wrote. “Girardi caused irreparable harm to hundreds of his clients, and the State Bar could have done more to protect the public. We can never allow something like this to happen again.”

            An ongoing investigation by an outside law firm is examining whether Girardi’s influence or connections at the bar helped him evade discipline for the unusual volume of complaints.

            Girardi and attorney David Lira, 62, his son-in-law, and firm CFO Christopher Kamon face eight charges of wire fraud and four counts of criminal contempt of court in Chicago.

            Girardi and Kamon, 49, are charged in Los Angeles with wire fraud for embezzling more than $15 million from clients, prosecutors said.

            In one case, described in the LA indictment, Girardi settled a case for $53 million involving a man severely burned in a PG&E gas line explosion in San Bruno, California, in 2010. But he told the client the settlement was for $7.25 million.

            More than half the settlement was then embezzled and some was used to pay expenses, firm liabilities and other clients whose funds had also been misappropriated. Payments to the burn victim, meanwhile, were delayed through a series of stall tactics.

            When asked about how an Alzheimer's diagnosis that Girardi was given in his conservatorship matter would affect the criminal case, Estrada said it would be up to the court to evaluate his mental competency.

            “The indictment charges misconduct during a 10-year timeframe,” he said. “When Mr. Girardi was a practicing lawyer, we believe the evidence shows he was competent during that time.”

            Girardi is expected to appear Monday in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles. Arraignments were set for Feb. 7 in Chicago.

            Kamon, who is custody, has pleaded not guilty to another wire fraud case in which he's accused of embezzling law firm funds to renovate two LA-area homes, pay for shopping sprees and hire an escort.

            Attorneys for Girardi and Kamon did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

            Lira's attorney said his client is innocent, will plead not guilty and will fight the charges.

            “David Lira was not involved in a scheme to defraud,"" attorney Damon Cheronis said in an email. “Mr. Lira is a well-respected lawyer and has been for over three decades.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797586,2nd ex-NC State athlete sues school in sexual abuse case,"A second former North Carolina State athlete sued the school Wednesday alleging he was sexually abused by the Wolfpack’s former director of sports medicine under the guise of treatment.

            The lawsuit filed in federal court accuses Robert Murphy Jr. of improperly touching the athlete’s genitals and elsewhere between two separate occasions in 2016. The plaintiff’s name is listed as “John Doe” to protect anonymity and doesn’t specify which sport he played.

            The Title IX lawsuit alleges the school failed in a “duty of reasonable care” to protect the plaintiff and was “deliberately indifferent” in acting on concerns about Murphy’s conduct.











            
                Former Wolfpack soccer player Benjamin Locke was the first to sue the school in late August, accusing Murphy of improperly touching his genitals during roughly 75 to 100 massages that Locke said he later believed lacked “legitimate” medical necessity between August 2015 and May 2017.

            That lawsuit also alleged that former head coach Kelly Findley told a senior athletics official in February 2016 that Murphy was “engaging in contact… consistent with ‘grooming behavior’” but there was no follow-up action by the school.

            The Associated Press typically doesn’t identify those who say they have been sexually assaulted or abused, but Locke spoke out publicly.

            The lawsuit states the second athlete came forward after learning of Locke’s complaint and cites similar allegations in terms of the school’s response.

            Both lawsuits stated the athletes had sought professional counseling.

            Durham-based attorney Kerry Sutton, who has worked numerous Title IX cases as well as sexual harassment matters in 14 states, represents both clients. In a statement to the AP, Sutton said she has spoken with four men with “similar claims so far.”

            “Ben Locke and John Doe suffered silently for years and hope their stories will inspire others to come forward,” Sutton said. “Locke and John Doe shine a spotlight on a dark corner in the NCSU athletics department that was presumed to be safe.”

            Jared Hammett, a Raleigh-based attorney working with Murphy, didn’t immediately return an email requesting comment Wednesday. An attorney who worked with Murphy previously has said Murphy offered “appropriate medical procedures ... but nothing that was ever of a sexual nature.”

            The school said previously that Murphy, who arrived in 2012 from Mercer, was placed on administrative leave in January 2022 amid a Title IX investigation tied to Locke’s allegations.

            Locke's complaint stated he learned in June that Murphy no longer worked at N.C. State due to an “involuntary separation,” though reasons weren't disclosed. The Title IX investigation ultimately found “a violation would have been substantiated via the preponderance of the evidence standard” if Murphy remained, according to a letter to Locke from the school’s Office for Institutional Equity and Diversity.

            In a statement Wednesday, N.C. State declined comment on specific allegations while reviewing the lawsuit.

            “Sexual misconduct of any kind is completely unacceptable and contrary to the culture and standards of the athletic department and the university,” the school said, adding its commitment ""to continually reviewing and improving its processes to ensure student health, safety and privacy.”

            Follow Aaron Beard on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/aaronbeardapA second former North Carolina State athlete sued the school Wednesday alleging he was sexually abused by the Wolfpack’s former director of sports medicine under the guise of treatment.The lawsuit filed in federal court accuses Robert Murphy Jr. of improperly touching the athlete’s genitals and elsewhere between two separate occasions in 2016. The plaintiff’s name is listed as “John Doe” to protect anonymity and doesn’t specify which sport he played.The Title IX lawsuit alleges the school failed in a “duty of reasonable care” to protect the plaintiff and was “deliberately indifferent” in acting on concerns about Murphy’s conduct.Former Wolfpack soccer player Benjamin Locke was the first to sue the school in late August, accusing Murphy of improperly touching his genitals during roughly 75 to 100 massages that Locke said he later believed lacked “legitimate” medical necessity between August 2015 and May 2017.That lawsuit also alleged that former head coach Kelly Findley told a senior athletics official in February 2016 that Murphy was “engaging in contact… consistent with ‘grooming behavior’” but there was no follow-up action by the school.The Associated Press typically doesn’t identify those who say they have been sexually assaulted or abused, but Locke spoke out publicly.The lawsuit states the second athlete came forward after learning of Locke’s complaint and cites similar allegations in terms of the school’s response.Both lawsuits stated the athletes had sought professional counseling.Durham-based attorney Kerry Sutton, who has worked numerous Title IX cases as well as sexual harassment matters in 14 states, represents both clients. In a statement to the AP, Sutton said she has spoken with four men with “similar claims so far.”“Ben Locke and John Doe suffered silently for years and hope their stories will inspire others to come forward,” Sutton said. “Locke and John Doe shine a spotlight on a dark corner in the NCSU athletics department that was presumed to be safe.”Jared Hammett, a Raleigh-based attorney working with Murphy, didn’t immediately return an email requesting comment Wednesday. An attorney who worked with Murphy previously has said Murphy offered “appropriate medical procedures ... but nothing that was ever of a sexual nature.”The school said previously that Murphy, who arrived in 2012 from Mercer, was placed on administrative leave in January 2022 amid a Title IX investigation tied to Locke’s allegations.Locke's complaint stated he learned in June that Murphy no longer worked at N.C. State due to an “involuntary separation,” though reasons weren't disclosed. The Title IX investigation ultimately found “a violation would have been substantiated via the preponderance of the evidence standard” if Murphy remained, according to a letter to Locke from the school’s Office for Institutional Equity and Diversity.In a statement Wednesday, N.C.

            SPAIN

            Real Madrid hosts Valencia in a league match postponed from January because of the teams' participation in the Spanish Super Cup. Madrid and Valencia played in the semifinals of the tournament in Saudi Arabia, with Madrid advancing in a penalty shootout before eventually losing the final to Barcelona. Madrid needs a win at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium to stay close to league leader Barcelona. It will be Valencia's first game without coach Gennaro Gattuso, whose contract was terminated by mutual agreement amid the team's poor run. Valencia has won only one of its last 10 league games and is one point above the relegation zone. Its only two wins this year came in the Copa del Rey.











            ITALY

            Juventus will try to put its league misery behind it when it hosts Lazio with a place in the Italian Cup semifinals at stake. Juventus was penalized 15 points last month for false accounting and that, coupled with poor results has left it just 10 points above the relegation zone. Sunday’s 2-0 loss at home to Monza was preceded by a draw against Atalanta and a hefty 5-1 loss at Napoli. Juventus has won the trophy a record 14 times however. Lazio is undefeated in its past five matches but lost 3-0 at Juventus in the league in November. The winner will face holder Inter Milan in a two-legged semifinal in April.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797588,Spanish league decries 'doped' market of high-spending EPL,"MADRID (AP) — Spanish league president Javier Tebas criticized the high spending of the Premier League clubs in the winter transfer window on Wednesday, saying the “British market is doped.”

            Tebas pointed to Chelsea's spending spree after the London club made almost half of the signings in the Premier League while spending about $225 million — more than every club in the top leagues in Spain, Italy, Germany and France combined.

            “The Premier League is a competition that loses billions of pounds in the last few years,” Tebas said. “And this is financed with contributions from the patrons, in this case large American investors who finance at a loss. This does not happen in the Spanish League and neither does it happen in the German League, especially those two.”











            Tebas noted Spain's strict control of economic sustainability by not allowing “contributions to cover losses in these barbaric amounts that are occurring, and that is what makes the difference in the market.”

            Tebas recognized that the English clubs have a higher turnover commercially “but not in the volume of this difference that there is.”

            “It is quite dangerous that the markets are doped, inflated, as has been happening in recent years in Europe, because that can jeopardize the sustainability of European football,” Tebas said.

            The Spanish league president, whose goal has been to cut into the Premier League's global dominance, said that “buying players at the price the Premiership buys them is inflationary buying.”

            He said the Spanish league still does well and noted that it recently had two Champions League semifinalists, as well as the Ballon d'Or winner in Real Madrid's Karim Benzema and the Golden Boy winner in Barcelona's Gavi.

(AP) — AL batting champion Luis Arraez went to a salary arbitration hearing Wednesday against the Miami Marlins, who acquired the infielder from the Minnesota Twins last month.

            Arraez asked for a raise from $2.2 million to $6.1 million, and the Marlins argued for $5 million. The case was heard by John Stout, Mark Burstein and Scott Buchheit, who are expected to issue a decision Thursday.

            Arraez hit .316 with eight homers, 49 RBIs and a .795 OPS, starting 61 games at first base, 34 at designated hitter and 31 at second. The 25-year-old was traded on Jan. 20 for starting pitcher Pablo López and a pair of prosects: infielder Jose Salas and outfielder Byron Chourio.











            Arraez is eligible for free agency after the 2026 season.

            Seattle defeated Diego Castillo in the first salary arbitration decision this year on Wednesday, and the relief pitcher will get a raise to $2.95 million rather than his request of $3,225,000.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797592,Both sides use trove of cell data at Alex Murdaugh trial,"A state agent testifying Wednesday in Alex Murdaugh's double murder trial meticulously reconstructed activity from his iPhone and the cellphones of his son and wife the night they were killed to try to link the disgraced South Carolina attorney to the shooting deaths.

            The key evidence for prosecutors is a video from the son's phone of a dog at the kennels near where Murdaugh's son Paul was killed with a shotgun and wife Maggie was shot several times with a rifle at the family's Colleton County hunting lodge on June 7, 2021.

            The timeline from prosecutors said the video was taken about five minutes before the killings. Two friends of Paul Murdaugh testified later Wednesday that they were certain they heard Alex, Paul and Maggie Murdaugh's voices on it.











            In interviews with police, Alex Murdaugh said he was never at the kennels that night.

            Later Wednesday, Murdaugh's defense used that same data to suggest that Murdaugh's phone and his wife's phone were not together when her iPhone recorded a final change in orientation between portrait and landscape mode, indicating it may have been tossed on the side of the road about a half-mile (800 meters) from the family's property. 

            Murdaugh, 54, is standing trial on two counts of murder in the shootings of his 52-year-old wife and 22-year-old son. Murdaugh faces 30 years to life in prison if convicted.

            Court ended Wednesday with a cliffhanger. Judge Clifton Newman said he would rule Thursday morning on whether evidence of Murdaugh possibly stealing from clients and his family law firm could be admitted.

            Prosecutors opened the door by asking one of Paul Murdaugh's friends in the last question of the day if he knew anything about Alex Murdaugh “being confronted on the morning of June 7, 2021, about $792,000 of missing fees from his law firm?” The friend answered no.

            Prosecutors said fear that this theft was about to be exposed led Murdaugh to kill his wife and son to get sympathy and buy time to cover up the crimes. The defense said it's absurd to think a lawyer would believe the brutal deaths of his family would not bring more scrutiny into his life.

            State Law Enforcement Division Lt. Britt Dove returned to the witness stand Wednesday on the fifth day of testimony. He specializes in retrieving and analyzing cellphone data.

            Dove went over a trove of information from the cellphones of Alex Murdaugh, his wife and son. There were phone call logs and texts, steps recorded, apps asking for information, GPS locations, changes when the phone went from vertical portrait mode to horizontal landscape mode and back, and — key to the prosecution's case — when the camera was activated.

            The last time the camera on Paul Murdaugh's cellphone came on was 8:44:49 p.m., when it took a video for under a minute, Dove said.

            Someone appears in the video to be trying to get an image of a wagging dog's tail. Voices are heard trying to get the dog to stay still and figuring out if it had a chicken or a guinea in its mouth.

            The video was meant for Rogan Gibson, who testified Wednesday he considered the Murdaughs a second family.

            “Can you think of any circumstances that you can envision, knowing them as you do, where Alex would brutally murder Paul and Maggie,"" defense lawyer Jim Griffin asked Gibson.

            “Not that I can think of,"" he responded.

            Paul Murdaugh read the final text on his phone at 8:48:59 p.m. and 36 seconds later another text came in that he never read. Maggie Murdaugh's phone showed she last read a text 28 seconds later, Dove testified.

            Alex Murdaugh told police the night of the killings and three days later that he was never at the kennels with his family, instead taking a short nap several hundred yards away before leaving to visit his ailing mother. Computer data from the SUV indicated he started the vehicle at about 9:06 p.m. and drove off.

            At nearly the same time, Alex Murdaugh's phone called his wife's phone, which indicated its display came on and there was an orientation change. Defense attorney Phillip Barber suggested to Dove that the person who killed Maggie Murdaugh had her phone in their hand and was surprised at the call, throwing it out the window.

            Dove said he didn't have enough information, such as how the phone could have been thrown, to agree or disagree.

            There were no more significant changes to Maggie Murdaugh's phone until it was recovered from the side of the road the next day, Dove said.

            But about five minutes after she read the final text, Maggie Murdaugh's data indicated her cellphone camera turned on for one second. Dove told prosecutors that can happen when an iPhone is trying to detect a face to see if it is the owner wanting to unlock the phone.

            The defense suggested a different scenario — that in a panic, she tried to use her phone camera to take a photo of someone.

            “And if the perpetrator or perpetrators responded by shooting at her, would that explain why it went off in one second and there was a bunch of orientation changes very shorty thereafter?"" Barber asked.

            “There’s a lot of possibilities could happen not knowing how a person reacts,"" Dove said.

            Prosecutors also had Dove read where Maggie Murdaugh texted someone that she was worried about her husband's health, and after a doctor's appointment that day, she was heading back to the lodge in Colleton County instead of the family's house on Edisto Island. 

            ""Alex wants me to come home,"" she texted.

            Alex Murdaugh also faces about 100 charges related to accusations of money laundering, stealing millions from clients and the family law firm, tax evasion and trying to get a man to fatally shoot him so his surviving son could collect a $10 million life insurance policy. He was being held in jail without bail on those counts before he was charged with murder.

            Since the killings, Murdaugh’s life has seen a stunningly fast downfall. His family dominated the legal system in tiny Hampton County for generations, both as prosecutors and private attorneys known for getting life-changing settlements for accidents and negligence cases.A state agent testifying Wednesday in Alex Murdaugh's double murder trial meticulously reconstructed activity from his iPhone and the cellphones of his son and wife the night they were killed to try to link the disgraced South Carolina attorney to the shooting deaths.The key evidence for prosecutors is a video from the son's phone of a dog at the kennels near where Murdaugh's son Paul was killed with a shotgun and wife Maggie was shot several times with a rifle at the family's Colleton County hunting lodge on June 7, 2021.The timeline from prosecutors said the video was taken about five minutes before the killings.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797593,Top Dem on House intel seeks briefings on classified records,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The new top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee on Wednesday called for more information about the classified records discovered in the private possession of President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump.

            Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut was named the committee’s ranking member Wednesday by House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. Along with Ohio Rep. Mike Turner, the committee's new Republican chairman, Himes will lead a panel that has been split by highly political fights in a break from its traditionally quieter oversight of the U.S. spy agencies. 

            Turner and the leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee have in recent weeks pushed the White House to share more in private about the classified material found. The U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence has declined to comment on its review of classified material, which is also the subject of multiple Justice Department investigations.











            “There’s a strong bipartisan concern that Congress is not being briefed on even preliminary reviews of classified information that might have been exposed,” Himes said in an interview Wednesday with The Associated Press. “That’s wrong. That’s wrong as a matter of law.”

            The intelligence committees already face several major tests this year, from multiple discoveries of top leaders keeping classified documents to the fight over whether to renew foreign surveillance powers used by the FBI, National Security Agency and other spy agencies. 

            Himes succeeds Rep. Adam Schiff, who was Jeffries’ original pick to lead the Democrats but along with Rep. Eric Swalwell was denied a spot on the panel by House Speaker Kevin McCarthy.

            McCarthy accused Schiff of lying to Americans when he led the Intelligence Committee during the first impeachment of Trump, who was accused of withholding military aid to Ukraine unless President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced an investigation of Biden and his son. 

            And McCarthy alleged Swalwell was compromised based on his contact with a suspected Chinese spy. Both Schiff and Swalwell denied McCarthy's allegations and accused him of taking political retribution.

            Himes said Republicans had wrongly accused Swalwell of being a security risk and said Schiff had been a strong leader of the panel. 

            “It's not that hypocrisy is a new thing to me, but in this case, it obviously removed some real institutional knowledge from the committee, so I was disappointed,"" Himes said. 

            But Himes said he and Turner have a “really good working relationship” and noted that they traveled to Ukraine together last year to meet Zelenskyy. 

            “When you spend 12 hours on an overnight train together, you get to know each other a little bit,” Himes said. “He's extremely knowledgeable on a lot of topics, so I'm really looking forward to working with him.”

            In the interview, Himes outlined his priorities for the committee as well as his views on Russia and China. 

            He called on the Biden administration to supply Ukraine with the longer-range missiles it has long sought to fend off Russia, saying the U.S. must prevent the war from becoming a stalemate. 

            Himes and others say the U.S. should grant Ukrainian requests for the Army Tactical Missile System, known as ATACMS, which use the same launchers as the HIMARS rockets that Kyiv has successfully used but have a range as much as three times greater. U.S. officials have been concerned that Ukraine could use longer-range missiles to strike targets inside Russia and possibly provoke a direct war between Washington and Moscow. 

            “We’ve done a great job, but that we haven’t pressed the accelerator quite as much as we should have,” he said. “A stalemate is a Russian victory, and that can’t be the ending. So we need to give the Ukrainians the tools they need to continue to push the Russians backwards.”

            Himes also called for greater discussion of how a war between Beijing and Taiwan would damage American interests and particularly the U.S. economy, given China’s ownership of U.S. sovereign debt and the business relationships between the two countries. He criticized a recent reported statement by Air Force Gen. Michael Minihan, who predicted in a memo that China and the U.S. could be at war in two years.

            “Everybody’s starting to listen to the drums of war and how do we arm and how do we fight,” Himes said. “It’s time to really sober up and think harder about how we avoid a military conflict with China.”

Both Schiff and Swalwell denied McCarthy's allegations and accused him of taking political retribution.Himes said Republicans had wrongly accused Swalwell of being a security risk and said Schiff had been a strong leader of the panel.“It's not that hypocrisy is a new thing to me, but in this case, it obviously removed some real institutional knowledge from the committee, so I was disappointed,"" Himes said.But Himes said he and Turner have a “really good working relationship” and noted that they traveled to Ukraine together last year to meet Zelenskyy.“When you spend 12 hours on an overnight train together, you get to know each other a little bit,” Himes said. “He's extremely knowledgeable on a lot of topics, so I'm really looking forward to working with him.”In the interview, Himes outlined his priorities for the committee as well as his views on Russia and China.He called on the Biden administration to supply Ukraine with the longer-range missiles it has long sought to fend off Russia, saying the U.S. must prevent the war from becoming a stalemate.Himes and others say the U.S. should grant Ukrainian requests for the Army Tactical Missile System, known as ATACMS, which use the same launchers as the HIMARS rockets that Kyiv has successfully used but have a range as much as three times greater. U.S. officials have been concerned that Ukraine could use longer-range missiles to strike targets inside Russia and possibly provoke a direct war between Washington and Moscow.“We’ve done a great job, but that we haven’t pressed the accelerator quite as much as we should have,” he said. “A stalemate is a Russian victory, and that can’t be the ending. So we need to give the Ukrainians the tools they need to continue to push the Russians backwards.”Himes also called for greater discussion of how a war between Beijing and Taiwan would damage American interests and particularly the U.S. economy, given China’s ownership of U.S. sovereign debt and the business relationships between the two countries. He criticized a recent reported statement by Air Force Gen. Michael Minihan, who predicted in a memo that China and the U.S. could be at war in two years.“Everybody’s starting to listen to the drums of war and how do we arm and how do we fight,” Himes said. “It’s time to really sober up and think harder about how we avoid a military conflict with China.”___Associated Press writer Tara Copp contributed to this report.",2023/02/02,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797594,California seeks new gun restrictions following shootings,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California could soon ban people from carrying guns in nearly all public places as Gov. Gavin Newsom and his allies in the state Legislature seek to test the limits of the U.S. Supreme Court’s new conservative majority in the aftermath of six mass shootings last month that left 29 people dead

            Churches, public libraries, zoos, amusement parks, playgrounds, banks and all other privately owned businesses that are open to the public would be gun-free zones — even for people who have a permit to carry concealed guns -- under new legislation announced Wednesday. The one exception would be for business owners or churches who put up a sign that guns are OK on their property.

            “You don't need a gun to go to Dodger Stadium or to your daughter's AYSO soccer game,” said Anthony Portantino, a Democratic state senator from La Cañada Flintridge and the author of the bill.











            
                The bill is California's next move in its chess match with the U.S. Supreme Court's conservative majority over guns and where people are allowed to have them. Last year, the court struck down California's rules that required a person to give a reason for wanting a permit to carry a concealed gun — such as a threat to their safety.

            That ruling set new standards for how states can regulate guns. This proposal is California's response to those new standards, a carefully crafted bill supporters believe complies with the court's ruling while also imposing tough new restrictions. 

            Portantino, who recently announced a run for Congress, said he wrote the bill expecting it to be challenged in court. While the bill would ban people from carrying guns in nearly all public places, it includes a broad exception for business owners who put up a sign saying guns are OK on their property.

            “By having that provision, you can't argue that it's a total prohibition,” Portantino said. “You can't argue that it's somehow so prescriptive that people can't have some sovereignty over the issue, and I think that's a legal nuance that I think helps it with constitutional muster.”

            Gun rights groups don't buy it. Chuck Michel, president of the California Rifle and Pistol Association, said his group has a lawsuit already written and ready to file the moment the bill is signed into law. He said in other states, the law is to make business owners put up a sign if they don't want concealed guns allowed.

            “That flips the Second Amendment on its head,” he said. “By doing it the other way, they are hoping that they can criminalize possession in more places.”

            The bill would also make lots of changes to how people can apply for a permit to carry a concealed gun in California. No one could get a permit if they are younger than 21. People would no longer have to give a reason for wanting a concealed weapon permit — like fearing for their safety — but they would still have to tell authorities about all of their prior arrests, convictions and restraining orders. 

            Plus, they would have to submit three character references and sit for an in-person interview. No one could carry more than two guns at once, and applicants would have to complete at least 16 hours of training, including on how to safely store and transport guns.

            California already bans the sale of guns to anyone under 21, with some exceptions for hunting. Last year, a federal appeals court struck down a California law that banned the sale of semiautomatic weapons to anyone younger than 21. That ruling suggests the age limit for a concealed carry permit could be challenged — but Portantino said he believes it would be legal.

            California — a state controlled by Democrats — has some of the toughest gun restrictions in the country. But that doesn't mean passing new restrictions is easy. Last year, lawmakers failed to pass a similar proposal on the final day of the legislative session. But that was more because of a strategic blunder by supporters to require a two-thirds vote of the Legislature so the bill could take effect immediately. 

            Democrats could not round up enough support, and the bill died.

            “That's not going to happen this year,” Newsom said Wednesday. “I will be signing this legislation.”

            Newsom and legislative Democrats repeatedly said they have renewed urgency to pass the bill this year after mass shootings in Monterey Park and Half Moon Bay left 18 people dead and 10 others wounded. In total, the state had six mass shootings in January and at least 29 people were killed.

            California Senate Republican Leader Brian Jones said the state has more than 100 gun laws, “and yet felons freshly back on the street continue to possess guns, known prohibited persons still have them, illegal firearms proliferate, and our databases remain inadequate.”

            “Instead of pretending more laws are needed to end these tragic shootings, I encourage the Executive branch to embrace their Constitutional duties and enforce those laws we already have,” Jones said.SACRAMENTO, Calif.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797595,Pat Flaherty hired as Rutgers offensive line coach,"PISCATAWAY, N.J. (AP) — Pat Flaherty, a member of two Super Bowl-winning staffs with the New York Giants, is returning to Rutgers as the offensive line coach.

            Coach Greg Schiano announced the hiring on Wednesday. The 66-year-old Flaherty started his coaching career at a Pennsylvania high school in the late 1970s.

            “Pat is a highly respected coach and someone I have known for a long time,” said Schiano, who hired Flaherty as a consultant last season. “His experience will be beneficial to the development of our offensive line. We all know the Big Ten is a line-of-scrimmage league and Pat understands what it takes to be successful at the highest level.”











            Flaherty spent two decades coaching in the college ranks, including a stint as the Scarlet Knights' offensive line coach from 1984-91. He also coached at East Stroudsburg, Penn State, East Carolina, Wake Forest and Iowa.

            His NFL career started with a job in Washington. He went to Chicago before working for the Giants for a stint that lasted from 2004-2015. During that time, the Giants won Super Bowls after the 2007 and 2011 seasons with lines that included three Pro Bowl selections: Chris Snee, David Diehl and Shaun O’Hara, a former Scarlet Knight.

            This will be Flaherty’s first coaching job since 2019 when he was the offensive line coach for the Miami Dolphins. He served as an analyst at Penn State in 2019-20 and as a consultant for the Giants in 2021. He also coached in the NFL with San Francisco and Jacksonville.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797596,Trump starts 3rd White House bid lagging in campaign cash,"NEW YORK (AP) — Former President Donald Trump’s political operation started the year with about $25 million socked away for his recently launched 2024 presidential campaign, a sum that is substantially less than what he had on hand just one year ago, new campaign finance reports show.

            The diminished sum, which is spread out across four campaign committees, is far less than the $105 million that Trump reported at the start of 2022. It speaks to the potential challenges for Trump as he mounts his third bid for the presidency facing what is likely to be a crowded field of GOP candidates who will also be vying for campaign cash from the party's donors. 

            Across his political committees, including his main campaign account, Trump raised $9.5 million since launching his bid on Nov. 15, according to his campaign, a far cry from the gargantuan sums his campaign boasted of raising in a matter of days — or even hours — back when he was still president. 











            Although Trump has faced questions about whether he would struggle to raise money, especially as some Republicans openly discuss whether it's time for the party to move on, his campaign defended the numbers.

            ""The campaign built out a second-to-none operation both on the national level and in early states since announcing. The President will wage an aggressive and fully-funded campaign to take our country back from Joe Biden and Democrats who seek to destroy our country,"" Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung said in a statement.

            Part of why Trump has less money than he previously did is because one of his committees, a leadership PAC called Save America, transferred $60 million to a separate super PAC supporting his bid. 

            Some campaign finance watchdogs have questioned the legality of that move, arguing that the transfer skirts limits placed on such committees, which were established to raise money for other candidates — not to finance a candidate's own political ambitions. Super PACs can raise unlimited sums but cannot formally coordinate spending with Trump’s campaign. 

            That committee, called MAGA Inc., started 2023 with more than $54 million to spend, according to reports filed Tuesday night with the Federal Election Commission. Super PACs can raise unlimited money and spend it freely but are barred from coordinating directly with campaigns.

            Trump has also spent at least $8 million on legal fees, while facing numerous investigations as well as a congressional inquiry into his role in the Jan. 6 insurrection.

            Trump's campaign has been off to a slow start, with the former president making his first campaign appearance over the weekend. At stops in New Hampshire and South Carolina, he said he was more committed than ever and promised to hold his signature big rallies soon. He recently opened a headquarters in Palm Beach, Florida, and has been hiring staff. 

            
                High-dollar donors have been reconsidering whether they'll stick with Trump as he's mired in investigations and legal troubles and has been blamed for Republicans' disappointing performance in the midterm elections.

            But his popularity among the ranks of Republican voters and his prolific fundraising relying on small-dollar donations could allow him to win the nomination without big donors' help.

            He will soon be able to revive a key fundraising source for his campaigns when his Facebook account is restored, allowing him to communicate directly with 34 million followers. The audience is more than seven times what he has on his Truth Social network.

            
                Facebook parent Meta announced it will be restoring Trump’s account in the coming weeks after a two-year suspension imposed after the Jan. 6 insurrection.

            At least one Republican challenger is preparing to jump into the race soon. Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who was Trump's ambassador to the United Nations, is planning to announce her campaign Feb. 15.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797599,North Carolina Senate again seeking LGBTQ limits in schools,"RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — A bill advancing in North Carolina's Senate would prohibit instruction about sexuality and gender identity in K-4 public school classes, defying the recommendations of parents, educators and LGBTQ youths who testified against it.

            Sponsors of the bill, approved Wednesday by the Senate education committee, say they want to grant parents greater authority over their children’s education and health care. In addition to making classroom reading materials available for parental review, the bill would require schools to alert parents, in most circumstances, prior to a change in the name or pronouns used for their child. It also instructs schools to inform parents of any discernible changes to a child's mental well-being. 

            Critics of the measure have equated it to the Florida law that opponents dubbed “Don’t Say Gay"" and warned that it could harm LGBTQ or questioning youths who have unsupportive families. But bill sponsor Sen. Amy Galey, an Alamance County Republican and education committee co-chair, said that without it, teachers can “shove parents out of the school door” and teach curriculum that conflicts with parents’ beliefs.











            “It baffles me to think that this bill would be divisive, quite frankly,” Galey told the committee Wednesday. “I cannot understand why it would be controversial to say that children 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 years old, should not be taught about sexuality or sexual activity in public school classrooms — that blows my mind.”

            A version of the bill passed the state Senate last year but did not get a vote in the House. The current bill raises the curriculum restriction to fourth grade, up from third grade in the previous version. Galey said the change was made because health classes begin around fifth grade.

            The bill now heads to the Senate health care committee. Prospects for passage this year have improved as Republicans increased their margins in the November elections, falling just one seat short of a veto-proof supermajority on the House side. 

            Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper said the legislature's past actions regarding the LGBTQ community demonstrate how much harm a bill like this could cause. He had signaled last year that he likely would have vetoed the 2022 bill had it reached its desk, linking it to the Florida law.

            “Parents are critical to the success of our schools, and their participation should be welcomed and encouraged, but the last thing we need is to force the ‘Don’t Say Gay’ culture wars on our children and our state,"" Cooper said in a statement Wednesday.

            House Speaker Tim Moore pointed last session to the political dynamics in the legislature as to why the bill didn’t get heard in 2022. There were enough Democrats in the House so that they could have upheld a Cooper veto if they remained united.

            Moore has said he anticipates some Democrats will join the GOP at times to complete veto overrides this session, but he hasn’t identified the topics on which they could. Republicans would likely need some Democratic support to push through the measure.

            Galey told reporters she was open-minded about negotiating with Democrats but would need to hear an extremely persuasive reason to change the K-4 restriction.

            Still, Moore suggested in June that a wide-ranging measure may not be needed. He pointed to laws already on the books about the discussion of sex-related topics in early grades.

            Lawmakers in at least 23 other states are currently considering similar bills, constitutional amendments or both. The states include many with Republican leadership and some liberal strongholds such as Oregon and Massachusetts, where the measures are unlikely to go far.

            The curriculum restriction outlined in North Carolina's bill would apply to standard course material, including textbooks, supplemental readings and information provided by third parties, but “does not include responses to student-initiated questions.”

            Sen. Michael Lee, a New Hanover County Republican and education committee co-chair, told reporters the bill is not meant to stifle classroom discussion or place a greater strain on educators.

            Democratic lawmakers, including Sens. Natasha Marcus of Mecklenburg County and Natalie Murdock of Durham County, said they were disappointed that this was the first bill on the committee's agenda instead of a more pressing matter, like teacher shortages.

            Jack Turnwald, a parent and former educator who left teaching due to their own experiences with anti-LGBTQ discrimination, said at the hearing that the bill would silence queer youth under the guise of parental rights. 

            ""I watched unsupported queer youth suffer due to a lack of education all around about who they are and how they can be supported in our schools,"" said Turnwald, who is transgender and nonbinary. “It is unsafe at present to be a trans educator or student in a hostile state like ours.”

            They warned the provision alerting parents of name or pronoun changes would forcibly out gender-nonconforming students before they’re ready and could contribute to the heightened risk of suicide for LGBTQ youths.

            “You don't have to love us,” said Brenda Dimas, a gay North Carolinian who testified at the hearing. “But your job requires you to protect and serve all your constituents, even the gay ones.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797602,Messi scores as PSG moves 5 points clear but Mbappe injured,"PARIS (AP) — World Cup winner Lionel Messi scored and Kylian Mbappé missed a twice-taken penalty before getting injured as Paris Saint-Germain won 3-1 at Montpellier to move five points clear at the top of the French league on Wednesday.

            Mbappé went down clutching his leg just under the right knee and limped off in the 21st minute — having earlier missed a twice-taken penalty and blazed the rebound over an open goal on his second effort.

            It was unclear exactly what his injury was. Television cameras also caught him rubbing the back of his left thigh as he walked to the dressing room.











            PSG coach Christophe Galtier told broadcaster Canal Plus “he took a blow behind the knee,” and then said at his news conference the injury does not appear serious.

            “Is it a bruise? We don't know yet. It doesn't look very serious,” Galtier said. “We're not too worried.”

            
                The Argentina star Messi tucked home PSG's second goal with a typically neat finish in the 72nd after being set up by Fabián Ruiz, who put PSG ahead in the 55th.

            Striker Arnaud Nordin pulled one back in the 89th and, with the home team pushing forward, 16-year-old substitute Warren Zaïre-Emery drove the ball home for 3-1 in stoppage time with his first goal for the club.

            “It's my first goal in the first division, so I'm very happy,” Zaïre-Emery said after becoming PSG's youngest scorer. The midfielder turns 17 in March.

            Defending champion PSG is five points ahead of Marseille, which won 2-0 at Nantes to move one point ahead of Lens into second spot for the automatic Champions League place.

            Lens lost 1-0 against Nice for its first home league defeat and second overall.

            PSG visits both Monaco and Marseille this month and is at Marseille in the French Cup, as well as takes on Bayern Munich in the first leg of their round-of-16 encounter in the Champions League on Feb. 14.

            Earlier, Marseille extended its unbeaten run to 10 games overall.

            Marseille scored in the 58th when Nantes central defender Joao Victor put the ball into his own net when tackling on-rushing winger Cengiz Ünder inside the penalty area. New signing Azzedine Ounahi, a midfielder with World Cup semifinalst Morocco, added the second goal in stoppage time on his Marseille debut.

            Nantes had not conceded a goal in its seven previous games. Marseille has won seven of its past eight league matches under coach Igor Tudor.

            Striker Gaetan Laborde netted for the second straight game as eighth-place Nice handed Lens its first league defeat since Oct. 9.

            Fourth-place Monaco continued its scoring form with a 3-2 home win against 19th-place Auxerre to stay one point ahead of fifth-place Rennes. Striker Wissam Ben Yedder and 17-year-old attacking midfielder Eliesse Ben Seghir both scored for Monaco, which has 13 goals in its past four league games.

            Forward Amine Gouiri scored twice for Rennes in a 3-0 home win against 18th-place Strasbourg while mid-table Lyon drew 0-0 at home to Brest.

            Elsewhere, English striker Folarin Balogun, who equalized in stoppage time when Reims drew 1-1 at PSG on Sunday, grabbed a hat-trick in his team's 4-2 win against Lorient to move top of the scoring charts. His 14 goals put him one ahead of PSG striker Kylian Mbappé.

            Balogun, who started his career at Premier League club Arsenal, netted his treble against goalkeeper Vito Mannone, who also began his career at Arsenal, and even went close to a fourth goal near the end.

            Dutch striker Thijs Dallinga followed up his two goals for Toulouse last weekend with his team's first goal in a 4-1 win against Troyes.

            Also, Clermont earned a 0-0 draw at Lille and last-place Angers lost 2-1 at home to fellow struggler Ajaccio, which scored in the fourth minute of injury time through striker Mounaïm El Idrissy.

            Angers has lost a French league record 13 straight matches and has won only two of 21 this season.

(AP) — A Hyundai Motor Group supplier announced Wednesday that it will invest $76 million in a new plant near Savannah to manufacture parts for the automaker's upcoming in plant in nearby Ellabell, hiring more than 500 workers.

            Seoyon E-HWA said it will build the plant to make interior and exterior parts including door trim, headlining and tailgate trim. The company plans to begin production in October 2024.

            The company already has a plant with 630 employees in LaGrange, near Hyundai's plant in Montgomery, Alabama, and Kia's plant in West Point. Seoyon E-Hwa operates 32 units worldwide.











            Seoyon E-HWA is the fourth Hyundai supplier to announce plans for a southeast Georgia plant since Hyundai in May said it would build a $5.5 billion plant to assemble electric vehicles and batteries. That plant, which could grow to 8,100 employees, is supposed to begin turning out vehicles in 2025.

            Earlier, Hyundai Mobis announced plans for a $926 million powertrain plant in Richmond Hill, employing 1,500. Joon Georgia announced plans for a $317 million plant near Statesboro, employing 630. Ecoplastic announced plans for a $205 million plant employing 456 in Register.

            Gov. Brian Kemp has proclaimed that his goal for his second term is to make Georgia the leading state for electric-powered vehicles.

            Trip Tollison, president and CEO of the Savannah Economic Development Authority, said the jobs would be “well paying,"" but didn't say how much workers would earn.

            The company already imports parts through Savannah's port to supply its LaGrange plant.

            The state will pay to train workers, but the total incentive package from state and local governments wasn’t immediately clear Wednesday. Seoyon E-HWA could qualify for more than $3.1 million in state income tax credits, at $1,250 per job over five years, as long as workers make at least $31,300 a year.SAVANNAH, Ga.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797604,Second jury finds Wisconsin man guilty in wife's slaying,"KENOSHA, Wis. (AP) — A jury found a Wisconsin man guilty Wednesday in a second trial for killing his wife with antifreeze and by suffocation in 1998.

            The verdict of first-degree intentional homicide against Mark Jensen was announced in a Kenosha County courtroom.

            Jensen, 63, first was convicted in 2008 in the slaying of Julie Jensen inside their Pleasant Prairie home. 











            
                Prosecutors alleged he began poisoning her with antifreeze in December 1998, drugged her with a sleeping medication and later suffocated her to death over a three-day period.

            Jensen had maintained his innocence, with his attorneys arguing that Julie Jensen was depressed and killed herself after framing her husband.

            He was sentenced then to life without parole, but a Kenosha County judge vacated Jensen's first conviction in April 2021 after the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled he deserved a new trial. The court found that a letter his wife wrote incriminating him in the event something should happen to her could not be used by the prosecution.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797606,Mbappé off injured for PSG after missing twice-taken penalty,"PARIS (AP) — Kylian Mbappé’s night went from bad to worse when he missed a twice-taken penalty for Paris Saint-Germain against Montpellier and blazed the rebound over the crossbar before limping off injured later in the game Wednesday.

            The World Cup star went off midway through the first half moments after clutching his right leg below the knee following a challenge. TV cameras also showed him rubbing the back of his left thigh as he walked to the dressing room.

            But PSG coach Christophe Galtier was optimistic.











            “Is it a bruise? We don’t know yet. It doesn’t look very serious,” Galtier said after PSG won 3-1 to move five points clear atop the league. “We’re not too worried.”

            PSG was awarded a penalty in the seventh minute via video replay when central defender Christopher Jullien was adjudged to have pulled back Sergio Ramos.

            Goalkeeper Benjamin Lecomte saved Mbappé’s first effort and, after the referee ordered it to be re-taken, made an outstanding save to push Mbappé’s effort onto the right post.

            Mbappé somehow missed an open goal when the rebound fell to him and he fired the ball high over the crossbar. Mbappé, who scored two penalties in his hat trick for France in the World Cup final and another one in the penalty shootout loss to Argentina, looked stunned.

            Mbappé sat down and pointed to his leg following a challenge. He was substituted in the 21st and was able to walk off the field unimpeded despite staff members offering assistance.

            The veteran central defender Ramos went off injured after about 30 minutes.

TV cameras also showed him rubbing the back of his left thigh as he walked to the dressing room.But PSG coach Christophe Galtier was optimistic.“Is it a bruise? We don’t know yet. It doesn’t look very serious,” Galtier said after PSG won 3-1 to move five points clear atop the league. “We’re not too worried.”PSG was awarded a penalty in the seventh minute via video replay when central defender Christopher Jullien was adjudged to have pulled back Sergio Ramos.Goalkeeper Benjamin Lecomte saved Mbappé’s first effort and, after the referee ordered it to be re-taken, made an outstanding save to push Mbappé’s effort onto the right post.Mbappé somehow missed an open goal when the rebound fell to him and he fired the ball high over the crossbar.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797607,"Kellen Moore excited to get to work with Chargers, Herbert","Kellen Moore worked with Justin Herbert on a commercial last year.

            The two will now try to see if they can get the Los Angeles Chargers’ offense to the next level.

            Moore was introduced as the Chargers offensive coordinator Wednesday after the two sides agreed to a deal on Monday.











            “It’s amazing how life can come full circle on you,” said Moore of the commercial shoot with Herbert for a Pacific Northwest auto group. “We laugh about those commercials, but we did get a chance to spend a few days this summer together as we went through that. He’s an awesome, awesome person, an awesome player. Certainly, we know all the physical talent, but I’m just really, really excited to work with him.”

            Moore said he has spent little time with Herbert besides the commercial. That will change, though, as the two try to get the Chargers to the next level.

            Los Angeles reached the playoffs for the first time since 2018, but the offense was inconsistent throughout the season. It was ranked ninth in total offense, but 20th in scrimmage yards per play, and had the third-worst rushing attack in the league.

            Moore comes to the Chargers after eight seasons with the Dallas Cowboys, including the past four as offensive coordinator. 

            After interviewing with the Carolina Panthers for their head coach opening last week, Moore talked with Dallas coach Mike McCarthy late last week about his future and then interviewed with the Chargers last Sunday.

            Monday’s announcement came less than 24 hours after Dallas said Moore would not return. He was the last of five candidates to interview for the opening. Joe Lombardi, LA’s coordinator for two seasons under coach Brandon Staley, was fired on Jan. 17.

            “I’ve been fortunate to have been at one spot for eight years — three years as a player and five years as a coach. It’s certainly a very special place to me,” Moore said. “As we went through the process, sometimes change can be really good for all of us, and I felt like I was in that space. It works for both sides. I think that it’s an awesome opportunity for Dallas and an awesome opportunity for me. I’m certainly really, really excited about how this thing all played out.”

            Moore worked with Staley last year in helping to organize the two days of practices between the Cowboys and Chargers. The two exchanged text messages throughout the season.

            In Moore’s four seasons as offensive coordinator, the Cowboys were second in the league in total offense (391.0 yards per game) and scoring (27.7 points per game).

            Staley said one important thing he is looking for from the offense is better balance. Los Angeles had the NFL’s second-biggest discrepancy between passing and running plays (65% pass to 35% run).

            Under Moore, Dallas was 53% pass to 47% run last season, tied for the ninth-highest rate of run plays.

            “As we build this thing, certainly, the run game and the play-action pass and the movements on first and second down, when those two are in sync, and the presentations are similar, it puts defenses in conflict,” Moore said. 

            “It will allow you to be more aggressive, to get the ball downfield. It certainly doesn’t mean that you go crazy with it, but you can build those marriages. We all know that the top offenses in this league, the beauty is when those two things are in sync. It’s a beautiful thing.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797611,US charges 4 key suspects in killing of Haiti’s president,"MIAMI (AP) — Four key suspects in the killing of Haiti's president appeared for the first time in U.S. federal court Wednesday to face accusations that they plotted and participated in his assassination, a day after they were transferred to the United States for prosecution. 

            Haitian-Americans James Solages, Joseph Vincent and Christian Emmanuel Sanon and Colombian citizen Germán Rivera García looked calm as they entered a federal court in Miami wearing beige prisoner uniforms with their hands and ankles shackled. 

            They did not speak at the hearing, except to petition for a public defender when Judged Alicia Otazo-Reyes asked each of them if they can afford to pay an attorney.











            “I would appreciate it if the court would appoint a counselor,"" said Solages, the second of the defendants called by the judge to listen to the charges. He, like each of them, answered “no” when the judge asked if they have work, savings or property.

            The judge appointed a different attorney for each of them. 

            Solages, 37, Vincent, 57, and Rivera, 44, were among the first arrested after Jovenel Moïse was shot 12 times at his private home near the capital of Port-au-Prince on July, 7 2021. All three are accused of conspiring to commit murder or kidnapping outside the U.S. and providing material support and resources resulting in death. 

            Sanon, a pastor, doctor and failed businessman, 54, is charged with conspiring to smuggle goods from the United States and cause export information not to be filed, as well as with smuggling goods from the United States and providing unlawful export information. Court documents state that he allegedly shipped 20 ballistic vests to Haiti, but that the items shipped were described as “medical X-ray vests and school supplies.”

            If convicted, Solages, Vincent and Rivera face up to life imprisonment. Sanon, whose associates have suggested he was deceived by the real and still unidentified masterminds behind the assassination, faces up to 20 years if convicted. 

            Duing the approximately half-hour hearing, the prosecutors requested that the four remain in detention at a federal prison, arguing there was a risk that they would flee the country. The judge set a bond hearing for Monday and arraignment for Feb. 15. 

            A total of seven suspects in the case are now in U.S. custody facing charges in South Florida for their alleged participation in the killing of the Haitian leader. Among them are Rivera and Mario Palacios, two among nearly two dozen former Colombian soldiers charged in the case. 

            The other suspects already in U.S. custody are Rodolphe Jaar, a former U.S. government informant and a Haitian businessman who was extradited from the Dominican Republic, where he was detained in January 2022.

            Also arrested that same month was Mario Antonio Palacios Palacios, a former Colombian soldier deported by Jamaica after fleeing there from Haiti. He was detained by U.S. officials in Panama during a layover while en route to Colombia.

            In January 2022, authorities arrested former Haitian Sen. John Joël Joseph, who also had fled to Jamaica.

            In Haiti, the case is at virtual standstill amid death threats that have spooked local judges. 

            According to court documents, two months before Moïse was killed, Vincent texted Solages a video of a cat “reacting alertly” to the sound of gunfire. Solages laughed, prompting Vincent to respond: “That’s the way Jovenel will be pretty much, but (sooner) if you guys really up to it!. Then Solages responded that “(this) cat will never come back,” and “trust me brother, we definitely working our final decision,"" the documents stated.

            Later, in June, some 20 former Colombian soldiers were recruited to supposedly help arrest the president and protect Sanon, who envisioned himself as Haiti’s new leader. Rivera was in charge of that group, according to the documents that are part of the case in South Florida.

            Authorities said the plan was to detain Moïse and whisk him to an unidentified location by plane, but that plot fell through when the suspects couldn’t find a plane or sufficient weapons.

            A day before the killing, Solages falsely told other suspects that it was a CIA operation and that the mission was to kill the president, according to the documents. Shortly before the killing, authorities said, Solages shouted that it was allegedly a DEA operation to ensure compliance from the president’s security detail.

            About a year after the killing, U.S. authorities say they interviewed Solages, Vincent and Rivera while they were in Haitian custody and that they agreed to talk.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797612,Updated permit required to legalize bedrooms at Twitter HQ,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — San Francisco building inspectors have given Twitter's construction contractor two weeks to submit a corrected building use permit if the social media company wants to keep using two conference rooms as bedrooms at its headquarters.

            The correction notice issued Monday from San Francisco's Department of Building Inspection to Hathaway Dinwiddie Construction Company asks the contractor to correctly label conference rooms as sleeping areas in a floor plan, the San Francisco Chronicle reported Wednesday. 

            The city launched an investigation in December after Forbes reported on the beds, prompting owner Elon Musk to lash out at San Francisco Mayor London Breed, even though there is no evidence she was involved in the inspection. 











            “So city of SF attacks companies providing beds for tired employees instead of making sure kids are safe from fentanyl. Where are your priorities @LondonBreed!?” Musk posted on Twitter, referring to a story about a baby's reported fentanyl overdose. 

            The other option is for Twitter to restore the conference rooms to their original use. 

            Hathaway Dinwiddie and Twitter did not respond to requests for comment. 

            Inaccurately labeled bedrooms appear to be the least of Musk's problems.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797613,FTC fines GoodRx for unauthorized sharing of health data,"In a first-of-its-kind enforcement, the Federal Trade Commission has imposed a $1.5 million penalty on telehealth and prescription drug discount provider GoodRx Holdings Inc. for sharing users' personal health data with Facebook, Google and other third parties without their consent.

            Under a settlement, California-based GoodRx also accepted that it will be prohibited going forward from sharing user health data with third parties for advertising purposes, the FTC said. GoodRx admitted no wrongdoing and said in a blog post that it settled “to avoid the time and expense of protracted litigation.” The agreement is pending federal court approval.

            Consumer protection advocates hailed Wednesday's announcement as a potential game-changer that could seriously curtail a little-known phenomenon: The trafficking in sensitive health data by businesses not strictly classified as health care providers. 











            ""Digital health companies and mobile apps should not cash in on consumers’ extremely sensitive and personally identifiable health information,” Samuel Levine, head of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a statement. “The FTC is serving notice that it will use all of its legal authority to protect American consumers’ sensitive data from misuse and illegal exploitation.” 

            The enforcement is the first under a 2009 law, the Health Breach Notification Rule, which applies to personal health record vendors and related providers not covered by HIPAA, the federal privacy rules that govern the health care industry,

            It comes three years after Consumer Reports discovered that GoodRx was sharing people's personal health information with more than 20 companies. “People told us they’d never expected that their sensitive information was being shared with the likes of Google and Facebook,” Marta Tellado, president and CEO of Consumer Reports, said in a statement Wednesday. “This is a win for consumers, and it could have a profound effect on how our health information is kept private moving forward.""

            In a legal complaint filed on the FTC's behalf, Justice Department lawyers said GoodRx's actions had “unjustly enriched” the company at the expense of users — many sufferers of chronic health conditions — who could face “stigma, embarrassment or emotional distress” as well as discrimination if facts it shared were disclosed.

            GoodRx said the focus of the FTC’s concerns was “proactively addressed” nearly three years ago, before the FTC inquiry began. 

            Justin Brookman, the director of technology policy at Consumer Reports, said he believed the FTC inquiry began after his organization’s Feb. 25, 2020 report. Prior to that, the government said, “GoodRx had no sufficient formal, written, or standard privacy or data-sharing policies or compliance programs in place. And, even after GoodRx’s practices came to light, it failed to notify users that their health information had been disclosed without their authorization.”

            Company spokeswoman Lauren Casparis said via email that GoodRx ""used vendor technologies to advertise in a way that we believe was compliant with all applicable regulations and that remains common practice among many websites.” 

            Those technologies included embedded web beacons known as “pixels” and other tracking and data-collection tools from companies including Google and Facebook, the government said.

            “They put pixels on their site,” Brookman of Consumer Reports said by telephone. “They don't have to do that.”

            In a statement, Brookman said “health apps and websites have been giving away our personal data for years without consequence. This case should be a turning point — now companies have to understand that sharing customer data without clear permission will lead to investigations and fines.""

            On its website, GoodRx says it has helped consumers save more than $45 billion since 2011.

            The FTC said more than 55 million consumers have visited GoodRx's website or mobile apps since January 2017. It said the company collects personal and health information from its users and from pharmacy benefit managers — the companies that manage prescription drug benefits — that confirm when one of its coupons has been used in a purchase. 

            The FTC said in a news release that GoodRx “deceptively promised its users that it would never share personal health information with advertisers or other third parties"" while sharing information on their prescriptions and health conditions with third-party advertising companies and platforms including Facebook, Google and Criteo. That process helped GoodRx target personalized ads on Facebook and Instagram and other platforms, the FTC said.

            Other provisions of proposed federal court order oblige GoodRx to direct third parties with whom it shared consumer health data to delete it and inform consumers. 

            GoodRX spokeswoman Casparis said the company believes ""the requirements detailed in the settlement will have no material impact on our business or on our current or future operations.”In a first-of-its-kind enforcement, the Federal Trade Commission has imposed a $1.5 million penalty on telehealth and prescription drug discount provider GoodRx Holdings Inc. for sharing users' personal health data with Facebook, Google and other third parties without their consent.Under a settlement, California-based GoodRx also accepted that it will be prohibited going forward from sharing user health data with third parties for advertising purposes, the FTC said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797614,Race to vaccinate rare wild monkeys gives hope for survival,"SILVA JARDIM, Brazil (AP) — In a small lab nestled in Brazil’s Atlantic Forest, researchers with gloved hands and masked faces cradle four tiny golden monkeys so a veterinarian can delicately slide a needle under the thin skin of each sedated animal’s belly. 

            The next morning, biologist Andréia Martins brings them to the precise spot where they were caught. She opens the wire cages and the monkeys dart out, hopping to a tree or the ground, ascending the canopy and regrouping as a family. They chatter noisily as they vanish into the rainforest.

            This brief, strange encounter with humanity has been for the sake of their own health – and the survival of their kind. These endangered wild monkeys, called golden lion tamarins, have now been vaccinated against yellow fever, part of a pathbreaking campaign to save a threatened species. 











            “Vaccinating wild animals for the sake of animals, not to protect humans, is novel,” said Luís Paulo Ferraz, president of the nonprofit Golden Lion Tamarin Association. 

            When yellow fever began to spread in Brazil in 2016, resulting in more than 2,000 human infections and around 750 deaths, it also quickly killed a third of the highly vulnerable tamarins, the majority of them in just a few months. So scientists in Brazil developed a yellow fever vaccine customized for the endangered monkeys.

            The inoculation campaign started in 2021, and already more than 300 tamarins have been vaccinated. The first such effort in Brazil, it raises vital questions about how far to go to save a species from extinction. 

            One of the traditional adages of conservation is “Leave it be.” But in an age when every corner of the globe is touched by human influence – from melting icebergs to fragmented forests to plastic-filled oceans – a new generation of scientists and environmentalists is increasingly calling for more interventionist approaches to save wild animals and ecosystems.

            Carlos R. Ruiz-Miranda, a conservation biologist at State University of Northern Rio de Janeiro, is among the scientists who have worked for more than three decades to protect the golden lion tamarins, twice going to their rescue when extinction threatened. He says the vaccinations are the only option left: “Is it too extreme? Give me another alternative.” 

            Viruses have always abounded in nature. But humans have drastically changed the conditions and impacts of how they spread in wildlife. Epidemics can travel across oceans and borders faster than ever, and species already diminished by habitat loss and other threats are more at risk of being wiped out by outbreaks.

            “Human activity is absolutely accelerating disease spread in non-human populations,” said Jeff Sebo, an environmental researcher at New York University, who was not involved in the Brazil project. 

            ___

            Southeastern Brazil was once covered by the rainforest, but today the undulating landscape is an uneven checkerboard of dark green jungle and grassy cow pastures – only 12% of this rainforest remains. 

            Yet it’s the only place in the world that wild golden lion tamarins live. 

            The longstanding effort to save the charismatic monkeys – famous for their copper-colored fur and small inquisitive faces framed by silken manes – included a pioneering captive breeding program, coordinated among around 150 zoos worldwide. Many of those animals were then carefully released in Brazil starting in 1984, in cooperation with local landowners.

            Then came yellow fever. 

            After the first lab-confirmed death of a tamarin from the virus in 2018, a census of the monkeys revealed the population of wild tamarins had dropped from around 3,700 to 2,500. 

            “This epidemic moved very quickly from north to south, across the country – no wildlife does that,” said Ruiz-Miranda. “It’s people. They cross vast distances in buses, trains, planes. They bring the disease with them.” Yellow fever is transmitted by mosquitoes, he explained, but highly mobile infected people spread the disease much farther and faster than insects alone.

            “We realized that in five years, we could lose the entire population if we did nothing” said Ferraz, of the Golden Lion Tamarin Association. 

            ___

            At the time of the yellow fever outbreak, Marcos da Silva Freire was a deputy director of technological development at Brazil’s Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, which oversees vaccine diagnostics and production in the country.

            Freire arranged with the Primate Center of Rio de Janeiro to begin trials of different doses of yellow fever vaccines on about 60 monkeys, close relatives of the tamarins, in January 2018. 

            A year later, he checked the level of antibodies in their blood. The vaccine appeared to work, without negative side effects. When the team got government approval to begin vaccinating wild monkeys, Freire supervised the first rounds of shots.

            So far, they’ve vaccinated more than 300 tamarins and detected no adverse side effects. When they’ve caught and retested monkeys, 90% to 95% have shown immunity -- similar to the efficacy of human vaccines. 

            The outbreak appears to have subsided, and the monitored monkey population has stabilized overall and even increased a little inside the Poço das Antas Biological Reserve. 

            ___

            While authorities elsewhere have inoculated animals to safeguard human health, it’s still very rare for scientists to administer vaccine injections to directly protect an endangered species. 

            “What are the unintended consequences of vaccination? You can’t always be certain,” said Jacob Negrey, a biologist and primatologist at Wake Forest University’s School of Medicine. 

            But increasingly scientists are examining the merits of vaccinating endangered wildlife, drawing up plans to potentially vaccinate tigers against canine distemper in Asia, chimpanzees against respiratory diseases in Africa, and koalas against chlamydia in Australia. 

            “There are people who say we shouldn’t touch nature, that we shouldn’t alter anything. But really, there are no pristine natural habitats left,” said Tony Goldberg, a disease ecologist and veterinarian at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who supports vaccinating wildlife when it’s safe and practical. 

            “People are waking up to the magnitude of the problem and realizing they have to do something.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797615,"Warnock, deal-maker yet party loyalist, settles into Senate","WASHINGTON (AP) — Newly reelected Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock of Georgia is promising to use his first full term to cut deals where possible with Republicans and deliver for his home state. But he’s adding a new role: unapologetic supporter of President Joe Biden.

            Warnock, who tried to avoid mention of Biden during his hard-fought campaign last year against Republican Herschel Walker, said he looks forward to supporting Biden if the president runs, as he has indicated he will, for a second term in 2024.

            “I’m not going to get ahead of the president,” Warnock told The Associated Press in a wide-ranging interview Wednesday. “I think he will announce that he’s going to run and ... I intend to support him.”











            Warnock, 53, sidestepped questions about his political ambitions but indicated he was warming to his status as a leading figure among Georgia Democrats. He said he is lobbying Biden and national Democrats to choose Atlanta for the party’s 2024 national convention. And he supports a plan by the Democratic National Committee, championed by Biden, to make Georgia an early nominating state in the presidential primary process.

            Warnock has faced voters five times over the past three years in an unusual combination of primaries, special elections, traditional elections and runoffs. Now he can settle into a six-year term.

            As he did during his last campaign, Warnock plays up the substance of his elected job — pushing Republicans in Georgia to expand Medicaid, capping insulin costs for diabetics on Medicare, working with Republicans on Capitol Hill to keep Georgia-based military operations open. That's in addition to his service as senior pastor at Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church. 

            “I don’t want to give them too much credit, but it’s just obvious that they ran a very good campaign,” said Chip Lake, a top adviser to Walker’s campaign.

            Warnock lamented some of the most searing attacks against him, especially tied to his position at Ebenezer , where Martin Luther King Jr. preached. Republicans hammered him for getting a $7,000-plus monthly housing allowance from the church. It was considerably higher than during his pre-Senate tenure and was a way for Warnock to continue to draw money from his pastor’s role while avoiding exceeding the Senate’s cap on members’ outside wage income.

            “We followed all of the requirements, and we disclosed everything,” he said.

            Lake said it’s a mistake to dismiss Warnock’s abilities simply because of how much Walker, a former football star and first-time candidate, struggled to navigate his troubled past. 

            Warnock’s winning runoff margin — just shy of 3 percentage points — was less than Republican Gov. Brian Kemp’s nearly 8-point victory in November over Democrat Stacey Abrams. But the bottom line, Lake said, is that Warnock did the same thing Kemp did: “He figured out to win his base and the middle.”

            The senator insists that he always will “work with anybody,” even the most conservative, Trump-allied Republicans. He declined to offer details about his relationships with Republican senators, saying he does not want to hurt them politically. 

            “When we’re working together to get things done, sometimes that’s not all that sexy to people and all that interesting,” he said.

            Warnock cited his collaboration with Rep. Buddy Carter, R-Ga., and the congressional delegation’s work on infrastructure, agriculture and in-state defense facilities. Warnock said there’s a group of senators from both parties who are willing to build on his measure that caps Medicare recipients’ monthly insulin costs at $35.

            “We ought to be able to get that done for people on private insurance as well,” Warnock said, though he would not identify GOP senators who might help the effort in a chamber where it takes 60 votes to move most legislation.

            Yet alongside his talk of bipartisanship, Warnock leveled a withering critique at Kemp and Georgia Republicans who have declined to expand Medicaid under the 2010 Affordable Care Act. The decision means hundreds of thousands of Georgians are not considered poor enough to qualify for existing Medicaid but also are not wealthy enough to use the health law's marketplace.

            “It’s obvious that Georgia ought to expand Medicaid. I mean, it’s really obvious. And the only thing that gets in the way of that is politics,” Warnock said, noting that many Republican-run states are among the 38 that have expanded Medicaid.

            Warnock said he has talked with Kemp since their respective victories but would not detail their conversations.

            Warnock said he does “pinch himself” because of his role and status as Georgia's first Black senator. He noted that his office is located in an imposing Washington edifice named for the late Georgia Sen. Richard Russell, who was serving when Warnock was born in 1969.

            “He got a lot of things done for Georgia. He did. But he was also a segregationist,” Warnock said. “I am inspired when I think about the arc of American history and what’s possible. We still have a long ways to go, but we’ve gotten a lot done.”WASHINGTON (AP) — Newly reelected Democratic Sen.

It was considerably higher than during his pre-Senate tenure and was a way for Warnock to continue to draw money from his pastor’s role while avoiding exceeding the Senate’s cap on members’ outside wage income.“We followed all of the requirements, and we disclosed everything,” he said.Lake said it’s a mistake to dismiss Warnock’s abilities simply because of how much Walker, a former football star and first-time candidate, struggled to navigate his troubled past.Warnock’s winning runoff margin — just shy of 3 percentage points — was less than Republican Gov. Brian Kemp’s nearly 8-point victory in November over Democrat Stacey Abrams. But the bottom line, Lake said, is that Warnock did the same thing Kemp did: “He figured out to win his base and the middle.”The senator insists that he always will “work with anybody,” even the most conservative, Trump-allied Republicans. He declined to offer details about his relationships with Republican senators, saying he does not want to hurt them politically.“When we’re working together to get things done, sometimes that’s not all that sexy to people and all that interesting,” he said.Warnock cited his collaboration with Rep. Buddy Carter, R-Ga., and the congressional delegation’s work on infrastructure, agriculture and in-state defense facilities. Warnock said there’s a group of senators from both parties who are willing to build on his measure that caps Medicare recipients’ monthly insulin costs at $35.“We ought to be able to get that done for people on private insurance as well,” Warnock said, though he would not identify GOP senators who might help the effort in a chamber where it takes 60 votes to move most legislation.Yet alongside his talk of bipartisanship, Warnock leveled a withering critique at Kemp and Georgia Republicans who have declined to expand Medicaid under the 2010 Affordable Care Act. The decision means hundreds of thousands of Georgians are not considered poor enough to qualify for existing Medicaid but also are not wealthy enough to use the health law's marketplace.“It’s obvious that Georgia ought to expand Medicaid. I mean, it’s really obvious. And the only thing that gets in the way of that is politics,” Warnock said, noting that many Republican-run states are among the 38 that have expanded Medicaid.Warnock said he has talked with Kemp since their respective victories but would not detail their conversations.Warnock said he does “pinch himself” because of his role and status as Georgia's first Black senator. He noted that his office is located in an imposing Washington edifice named for the late Georgia Sen. Richard Russell, who was serving when Warnock was born in 1969.“He got a lot of things done for Georgia. He did. But he was also a segregationist,” Warnock said. “I am inspired when I think about the arc of American history and what’s possible. We still have a long ways to go, but we’ve gotten a lot done.”",2023/02/02,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797618,New OC Riley looks to push Clemson offense into next gear,"CLEMSON, S.C. (AP) — Garrett Riley is almost familiar with his new facility at Clemson — emphasis on almost.

            Riley, who led TCU's offense on its run to the national title game this past season, took over as the Tigers' offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach a few days after the Horned Frogs lost the CFP championship to Georgia last month.

            Ever since, he warns recruits when taking them around Clemson's massive operations center, “better not ask me where something is,"" Riley said Wednesday at his formal introduction.











            Clemson signed all of its 27-member class in December before the offensive change. Tigers coach Dabo Swinney said the program was celebrating its newest members on national signing day, no newcomer more essential than Riley.

            Riley, 33, is the reigning Broyles Award winner as the game's top assistant for what he did at TCU, which went from five victories in 2021 to the College Football Playoff.

            Things happened so quickly — Swinney and Riley spoke for the first time the night after TCU's defeat — that Riley hasn't had the chance to fully celebrate his accomplishments last season.

            “It's been a whirlwind,” he said. “It was a great run (at TCU), just like it will be at Clemson.”

            Swinney praised his previous coordinator, Brandon Streeter, who led an attack that improved in yards and points from 2021 to 2022 and won the Atlantic Coast Conference championship in his only season in charge.

            “I just felt like it was the right time,” Swinney said. “We weren't quite where we needed to be.""

            Swinney talked to Riley's brother, Southern Cal coach Lincoln Riley, about Garrett before talking to him directly. Garrett Riley was the only person he talked with about the job, Swinney said.

            Garrett Riley played quarterback for Texas Tech and was groomed in the “Air Raid” offense of the late Mike Leach.

            Riley said Leach, who died two months ago while he was Mississippi State's head coach, had a profound impact on his coaching career — and not necessarily for the X’s and O’s.

            Leach and his “out of the box thinking were very appealing to me,” Riley said.

            More to Swinney's liking was Riley's use of the run. TCU finished 31st nationally at nearly 194 yards rushing per game. Riley is still learning new personnel but believes the base for success is there with Tigers runners Will Shipley and Phil Mafah.

            Shipley, a first-time All-ACC selection, gained 1,182 yards and 15 touchdowns. Mafah had 515 yards and four TDs.

            Riley gets dubbed with the “Air Raid” tag because of his background, Swinney said. “But if you study him, he runs the football,” the head coach continued. “I have no doubt he’s going to make us better offensively.”

            Riley had recruited expected Clemson starting quarterback Cade Klubnik to SMU when he worked there a few years back and believes they'll have a solid, productive partnership going forward.

            Every aspect of Clemson's program gives Riley confidence that the Tigers can land back where TCU was this year in the CFP semifinals, which Clemson has missed the past two seasons after making six straight from 2015 through 2020.

            Klubnik became starter late in the season, supplanting DJ Uiagalelei early in the ACC title game, and led the Tigers to a 39-10 victory over North Carolina. Klubnik and the Tigers struggled in their Orange Bowl loss to Tennessee, 31-14.

            Riley sees the potential ahead for his new group and sees Klubnik as a driving force.

            “I know that kid's foaming at the mouth just like the rest of our players, and trust me, us coaches are ready to get going, too,” Riley said.

            Riley, who was born and raised in Texas, said he and his family were happy at TCU. He wasn't looking to leave, particularly after the Horned Frogs' landmark season. But Clemson offered a prime opportunity for Riley to advance his career. He received a three-year contract worth $1.75 million per year.

            “It had to be something that was going to check the box in all areas,” Riley said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797630,Biden administration recommends major Alaska oil project,"JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) — The Biden administration released a long-awaited study Wednesday that recommends allowing a major oil development on Alaska's North Slope that supporters say could boost U.S. energy security but that climate activists decry as a “carbon bomb.”

            The move — while not final — drew immediate anger from environmentalists who saw it as a betrayal of the president's pledges to reduce carbon emissions and promote clean energy sources.

            ConocoPhillips Alaska had proposed five drilling sites as part of its Willow project, and the approach listed as the preferred alternative by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management in the report calls for up to three drill sites initially. Even as the land agency released its report, the U.S. Interior Department said in a separate statement that it has “substantial concerns” about the project and the report's preferred alternative, “including direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions and impacts to wildlife and Alaska Native subsistence.”











            The Bureau of Land Management, which falls under the Interior Department, also said in the report that identifying a preferred alternative “does not constitute a commitment or decision” and notes it could select a different alternative in the final decision.

            Opponents have raised concerns about the impacts of oil development on wildlife, such as caribou, and efforts to address climate change. 

            The project is in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, a vast region roughly the size of Indiana on Alaska’s resource-rich North Slope. ConocoPhillips Alaska says the project, at its peak, could produce an estimated 180,000 barrels of oil a day. 

            The Arctic Slope Regional Corporation, an Alaska Native corporation, and the Iñupiat Community of the Arctic Slope joined the North Slope Borough in praising the proposed alternative and calling on the administration to move ahead on the project. In a joint statement, they said advancing the project “is critical for domestic energy independence, job security for Alaskans and the right of Alaska Natives to choose their own path.”

            Other Alaska Native groups have expressed concerns.

            Leaders of the Native Village of Nuiqsut and city of Nuiqsut in a recent letter said they do not feel like the Bureau of Land Management is listening. The community is about 36 miles (58 kilometers) from the Willow project, in a remote region of Alaska’s far north.

            The Bureau of Land Management’s “engagement with us is consistently focused on how to allow projects to go forward; how to permit the continuous expansion and concentration of oil and gas activity on our traditional lands,” Native Village of Nuiqsut President Eunice Brower and City of Nuiqsut Mayor Rosemary Ahtuangaruak wrote in a letter dated last week.

            ConocoPhillips has estimated the project would create as many as 2,000 jobs during construction and 300 permanent jobs and generate between $8 billion and $17 billion in federal, state and local revenue in an area more than 600 miles (965 kilometers) from Anchorage.

            Erec Isaacson, the president of ConocoPhillips Alaska, said in a statement the company believes the project will “benefit local communities and enhance American energy security while producing oil in an environmentally and socially responsible manner.” He said the review process “should be concluded without delay.”

            The members of Alaska's congressional delegation — Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan and Rep. Mary Peltola, a Democrat — all said they welcomed Wednesday's environmental review and urged the administration to allow the project to move forward. 

            The project would bring miles of roads and hundreds of miles of pipeline to the area, disrupt animal migration patterns and erode habitat if it goes forward, said Earthjustice, an environmental group.

            Jeremy Lieb, an attorney with the group, said Willow is currently the largest proposed oil project in the U.S. He said it is “drastically out of step with the Biden administration’s goals to slash climate pollution and transition to clean energy.” President Joe Biden campaigned on pledges to end new drilling on public lands and has set an ambitious goal to cut greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030.

            Biden ""will be remembered for what he did to tackle the climate crisis, and as things stand today, it’s not too late for him to step up and pull the plug on this carbon bomb,” Lieb said.

            U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, who fought the Willow project as a member of Congress, has the final decision on whether to approve it, although top White House climate officials are likely to be involved. Haaland has multiple options, including outright approval or rejection or a middle ground that allows some drilling but blocks other development. A final decision is expected no sooner than early March. 

            Federal agencies have within the last week made two major decisions around resources in Alaska. Last week, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said it was reinstating restrictions on road-building and logging on the country’s largest national forest in southeast Alaska, the Tongass National Forest. 

            And on Tuesday, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said it was exercising its so-called veto authority under the federal Clean Water Act to block plans for a proposed copper and gold mine in a mineral-rich area of southwest Alaska because of concerns about its environmental impact on a rich Alaska aquatic ecosystem that supports the world’s largest sockeye salmon fishery.

Mary Peltola, a Democrat — all said they welcomed Wednesday's environmental review and urged the administration to allow the project to move forward.The project would bring miles of roads and hundreds of miles of pipeline to the area, disrupt animal migration patterns and erode habitat if it goes forward, said Earthjustice, an environmental group.Jeremy Lieb, an attorney with the group, said Willow is currently the largest proposed oil project in the U.S. He said it is “drastically out of step with the Biden administration’s goals to slash climate pollution and transition to clean energy.” President Joe Biden campaigned on pledges to end new drilling on public lands and has set an ambitious goal to cut greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030.Biden ""will be remembered for what he did to tackle the climate crisis, and as things stand today, it’s not too late for him to step up and pull the plug on this carbon bomb,” Lieb said.U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, who fought the Willow project as a member of Congress, has the final decision on whether to approve it, although top White House climate officials are likely to be involved. Haaland has multiple options, including outright approval or rejection or a middle ground that allows some drilling but blocks other development. A final decision is expected no sooner than early March.Federal agencies have within the last week made two major decisions around resources in Alaska. Last week, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said it was reinstating restrictions on road-building and logging on the country’s largest national forest in southeast Alaska, the Tongass National Forest.And on Tuesday, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said it was exercising its so-called veto authority under the federal Clean Water Act to block plans for a proposed copper and gold mine in a mineral-rich area of southwest Alaska because of concerns about its environmental impact on a rich Alaska aquatic ecosystem that supports the world’s largest sockeye salmon fishery.___Daly reported from Washington, D.C.",2023/02/02,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797631,New Mexico considers roasted chile as official state aroma,"ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) — The sweet smell of green chile roasting on an open flame permeates New Mexico every fall, wafting from roadside stands and grocery store parking lots and inducing mouth-watering visions of culinary wonders. 

            Now one state lawmaker says it's time for everyone to wake up and smell the chile. 

            Sen. Bill Soules' visit with fifth grade students in his southern district sparked a conversation about the savory hot peppers and the potential for New Mexico to become the first state in the nation to proudly have an official state aroma, a proposal now being considered by lawmakers. 











            “It’s very unique to our state,” the Las Cruces Democrat said of roasting chile. “I have tried to think of any other state that has a smell or aroma that is that distinctive statewide, and I can’t think of any.”

            For New Mexico, chile is more than a key ingredient for every meal. It's life. It's at the center of the official state question — “Red or green?” — and is one of the state's official vegetables.

            New Mexico produced more than 60% of the U.S. chile pepper crop in 2021 and is home to Hatch, an agricultural village known as the chile capital of the world for the unique red and green peppers it has turned out for generations. The famous crop also is used in powders, sauces and salsas that are shipped worldwide.

            Legislation recognizing roasted chile as the official aroma passed its first committee on Tuesday, and supporters say it's not likely to fire up much debate — other than lawmakers sharing their own stories about how they can't go a day without eating it, from red chile lattes to smothered breakfast burritos to plates of enchiladas and tamales infused with the peppers.

            “Chile is in the hearts and on the plates of all New Mexicans, and the smell of fresh roasting green chile allows us to reminisce on a memory eating or enjoying our beloved signature crop. We like to call that memory a person’s ‘chile story,’ and each of us as New Mexicans have a chile story,"" said Travis Day, executive director of the New Mexico Chile Association.

            Officially recognizing the aroma could also pay off as another way to market New Mexico to visitors.

            A legislative analysis of the bill noted that peak tourist season typically begins in March and tapers down toward the end of October, meaning it overlaps with the time for chile roasting. The analysis also noted that New Mexico has consistently lower visitation rates than neighboring Colorado, which reported 84.2 million visitors in 2021 compared with about 40 million in New Mexico. 

            “The new state aroma could help draw visitors away from Colorado, which, for some reason, thinks it has green chile comparable to that of New Mexico,” the analysis quipped, in a nod to an ongoing feud between the two states.

            Soules, a former teacher and elementary school principal, has been using the aroma legislation as an opportunity to teach the fifth-graders about the legislative process. The students have been researching state symbols in New Mexico and elsewhere as part of preparing to testify on behalf of the bill.

            “They’re learning how to lobby, how to write letters to legislators to support this bill, they’re practicing their public speaking,"" Soules said. ""They’re learning lots about other things as part of their curriculum around this as a topic, so it's a good education too.”ALBUQUERQUE, N.M.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797633,Devils associate coach Andrew Brunette charged with DUI,"DEERFIELD BEACH, Fla. (AP) — New Jersey Devils associate coach and former Florida Panthers head coach Andrew Brunette was arrested early Wednesday morning in South Florida while driving home from a bar in his golf cart, authorities said.

            Brunette, 49, was pulled over just blocks from the ocean in the Deerfield Beach area, north of Fort Lauderdale, according to a Broward Sheriff's Office arrest report. He was charged with one count of driving under the influence and two counts of disobeying a stop or yield sign. Brunette was released later Wednesday on $500 bond.

            The Devils said in a statement that the team was aware of Brunette's arrest and gathering additional information.











            According to the arrest report, a deputy was in the process of giving Brunette's illegally parked golf cart a ticket around midnight when Brunette walked out of a nearby bar and told the deputy he was about to leave. The deputy said Brunette seemed unsteady on his feet and slurred his speech, and when he was joined by his wife, the deputy said he overheard the wife tell Brunette not to drive while the deputy was there.

            The deputy remained in the area and reported watching the couple drive away about 17 minutes later, according to the report. The deputy said he watched the golf cart run two stop signs before pulling Brunette over on a residential street about a mile away from his home. According to the report, Brunette had difficulty following instructions during a field sobriety test before eventually quitting and asking for an attorney. He also declined to take a breathe test to measure his blood-alcohol level, officials said.

            Online jail and court records didn't list an attorney for Brunette.

            Brunette is in his first season as associate coach of the Devils. He was interim coach of the Florida Panthers last season after taking over when Joel Quenneville resigned for his connection to a 2010 Chicago Blackhawks sexual abuse scandal. 

            The Panthers fired Brunette after they lost in the second round of the playoffs last spring despite him leading them to the Presidents’ Trophy as the league’s top team during the regular season. 

            The Sudbury, Ontario, native played 1,159 NHL games for Washington, Nashville, Atlanta, Minnesota, Colorado and Chicago from 1995-2012. He was a Wild assistant in 2015-16 and worked on Florida’s staff from 2019-2022.DEERFIELD BEACH, Fla.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797634,"South Dakota Senate censures, reinstates suspended lawmaker","PIERRE, S.D. (AP) — The South Dakota Senate on Wednesday censured and reinstated a Republican senator who was suspended last week amid allegations she harassed a legislative aide by telling the aide that she had harmed her child by getting him vaccinated.

            The Republican-controlled Senate overwhelmingly approved a report from an investigative committee that concluded Sen. Julie Frye-Mueller harassed a staff member of the Legislative Research Council, which assists lawmakers with drafting bills and research. 

            The aide, who has not been publicly named, filed a complaint last week alleging that Frye-Mueller became aggressive when she asked about vaccines and told the aide her child could die from them or have health issues.











            According to the complaint, the aide also said Frye-Mueller asked her about breastfeeding. When the aide said she wished she could breastfeed, Frye-Mueller allegedly suggested that the aide's husband could “suck on my breasts” to get milk to come in, the complaint said. The aide said in her complaint — which was released by the Senate's investigative committee this week — that Frye-Mueller's husband was in the room at the time and that he “smiled and nodded.”

            Frye-Mueller said she was voicing her opinion that people should be able to choose to get vaccines, and that the staffer brought up breastfeeding. Frye-Mueller's husband has said he tried to leave the room when the latter issue came up.

            “The language contained in the staff person’s statement was shocking and filthy and is not what I said or conveyed,” the senator said in a statement Wednesday. “That aspect of the conversation was entirely fabricated. The permanent damage done to my reputation and that of my family is a stain that will not go away.”

            The senator has sued the Senate's leadership in federal court, arguing that her suspension, which was made without first holding a hearing, violated her right to due process and free speech and her ability to represent her constituents.

            “The Senate committee, in adopting its report, has clearly made a statement that we believe” the aide, Republican Sen. David Wheeler said. “We believe misconduct happened and some sort of discipline is appropriate.”

            Only one senator voted against adopting the report and its discipline: Republican Tom Pischke said he disagreed with nearly everything the Senate had done to discipline Frye-Mueller, that it had deprived her of due process and tried to cast doubt on the credibility of the aide.

            Frye-Mueller, who is allied with a right-wing group of Republicans, will be reinstated to the Senate but barred from interacting with most of the Legislative Research Council staff. She was allowed back on to the Senate floor Wednesday after the vote.

            “I completely disagree with the censure,” Frye-Mueller told reporters. “The only reason I’m going back in is to be a voice for the voters of District 30.” 

            Medical authorities say childhood vaccines are safe and help prevent potentially deadly diseases. They have have long been celebrated as public health success stories, but vaccination rates among kindergarteners have dropped nationwide in recent years.PIERRE, S.D. (AP) — The South Dakota Senate on Wednesday censured and reinstated a Republican senator who was suspended last week amid allegations she harassed a legislative aide by telling the aide that she had harmed her child by getting him vaccinated.The Republican-controlled Senate overwhelmingly approved a report from an investigative committee that concluded Sen. Julie Frye-Mueller harassed a staff member of the Legislative Research Council, which assists lawmakers with drafting bills and research.The aide, who has not been publicly named, filed a complaint last week alleging that Frye-Mueller became aggressive when she asked about vaccines and told the aide her child could die from them or have health issues.According to the complaint, the aide also said Frye-Mueller asked her about breastfeeding. When the aide said she wished she could breastfeed, Frye-Mueller allegedly suggested that the aide's husband could “suck on my breasts” to get milk to come in, the complaint said. The aide said in her complaint — which was released by the Senate's investigative committee this week — that Frye-Mueller's husband was in the room at the time and that he “smiled and nodded.”Frye-Mueller said she was voicing her opinion that people should be able to choose to get vaccines, and that the staffer brought up breastfeeding. Frye-Mueller's husband has said he tried to leave the room when the latter issue came up.“The language contained in the staff person’s statement was shocking and filthy and is not what I said or conveyed,” the senator said in a statement Wednesday. “That aspect of the conversation was entirely fabricated.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797635,Analysis: Tom Brady's legacy goes beyond Super Bowl rings,"TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — Tom Brady had nothing left to prove.

            Already considered the GOAT — greatest of all time — Brady finally walked away from the NFL on Wednesday following the most difficult, emotionally draining season in his life.

            “I’m retiring. For good,"" Brady said in a short video he posted on social media.











            Brady leaves with seven Super Bowl rings, five Super Bowl MVP awards, numerous other honors and nearly every passing record in league history.

            His success on the field is unmatched and his career accomplishments long ago cemented his Pro Football Hall of Fame credentials.

            But Brady’s legacy stretches beyond the field, his championships and his 89,214 passing yards and 649 touchdowns.

            He set a standard for longevity that will be difficult to duplicate. It requires unique dedication to proper training and nutrition, an unfailing commitment to mental preparation and an unquenchable desire to compete.

            At age 44, Brady led the NFL with a career-best 5,316 yards passing and tossed 43 TDs. In a subpar season by his standards, 45-year-old Brady still led the NFC with 4,694 yards passing, threw 25 TDs and broke his own NFL record for completions with 490.

            There’s little doubt Brady could still play another year at a high level despite the way his season ended with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers being dominated by Dallas in the playoffs. Brady still has the arm strength and there was no drop-off in his velocity. He threw a career-high 66 passes against the Cowboys in his last game, including on-target deep balls.

            However, Brady knows it’s time, especially after briefly retiring last year. His desire to be closer to his children and to spend more time with them after his divorce from supermodel Gisele Bündchen had to be a major factor in his decision.

            Now, Brady moves onto the next chapter. He’ll stay in football with a lucrative contract to be an analyst on Fox Sports.

            His impact on this and other sports carries on through his TB12 method.

            Brady’s extraordinary ability to excel in his 40s in a physically demanding game will inspire others to try to follow his path. That’s been one of Brady’s goals. He hopes athletes learn how to better take care of their bodies to allow themselves opportunities to extend their careers.

            “I feel like everything I’ve learned over the course of 23 years in football has and will allow me to continue to help people in different ways,” Brady said in September. “The things I’ve learned have been a huge benefit to me and I realize that there are systems that are broken and you’d like to try to improve that the best way you can by giving people the knowledge that has allowed me to be successful. I think a big part of my future life will be that as well.

            “Unfortunately, like everything else, there was a lot of money made in the old system and it’s hard because preventive care and preventive maintenance to your body is a challenge because it takes time and energy.

            ""But I think starting young is really important, educating people on what works as opposed to the way things have always been. And I think the way things have always been will always result in basically the same outcomes for people. And I think what I’ve tried to do is challenge that norm by performing over a long period of time, and I’ve really done it in a way that’s, I’d say, been unique. And I’ve tried to allow my teammates to learn, as well as tens of thousands of other people that have kind of been educated and adopted a different type of belief system.”

            One of Brady’s most striking characteristics was being relatable to teammates, even younger guys half his age. For a mega-celebrity, Brady was approachable, down-to-earth. He’d walk out of the stadium after games alone with no security or entourage surrounding him, chatting with anyone who came over to him whether it was reporters or stadium employees.

            “Just being able to meet him, play alongside him and just pick his brain as a human being outside of sports and things like that was great,” rookie running back Rachaad White said after Brady’s last game.

            Many of Brady's teammates echoed those sentiments.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797636,"Meta posts lower Q4 profit, announces huge stock buyback","SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Facebook parent company Meta posted lower fourth-quarter profit and revenue on Wednesday, hurt by a downturn in the online advertising market and competition from rivals such as TikTok. 

            But the company's stock soared in extended trading, as its revenue beat Wall Street's muted expectations and the Menlo Park, California-based company announced a $40 billion stock buyback. 

            This is the third consecutive quarter of revenue decline for the tech giant, which laid off 11,000 workers, or about 13% of its workforce, in November. CEO Mark Zuckerberg blamed the layoffs on aggressive hiring during the pandemic, when Meta's business boomed because people were stuck at home, scrolling on their phones and computers, glued to social media. But as the lockdowns ended and people started going outside again, revenue growth began to falter.











            ""(Our) management theme for 2023 is the ‘Year of Efficiency’ and we’re focused on becoming a stronger and more nimble organization,” Zuckerberg said in a statement Wednesday. 

            Meta's mega stock buyback appeared to ease investors' concerns over the company's spending on the “metaverse” — an immersive digital universe, viewed through a headset, that Zuckerberg predicts will eventually replace smartphones as the primary way people use technology.

            Meta Platforms Inc. said it earned $4.65 billion, or $1.76 per share, in the final three months of 2022. That's down 55% from $10.29 billion, or $3.67 per share, a year earlier.

            Analysts were expecting earnings of $2.26 per share, according to a poll by FactSet. 

            Revenue fell 4% to $32.17 billion from $33.67 billion. Analysts were expecting $31.55 billion. 

            Meta ended 2022 with a 1% revenue decline from 2021 — its first year-over-year drop. 

            “The downturn was slightly less than we thought it would be, but that’s not necessarily a good sign,” said said Insider Intelligence analyst Debra Aho Williamson. She said that Meta’s 2022 results were “a stark difference” from 2021, when the company's worldwide revenue grew 37%. 

            “Now the challenge is to return to positive territory. Meta needs to stay focused on stabilizing its core platforms, Facebook and Instagram,"" she added. ""And with losses at its VR division mounting, Mark Zuckerberg is going to have to accept an unfortunate reality: Virtual worlds are simply not what businesses or consumers want right now.”

            Meta's Reality Labs segment, which includes its virtual and augmented-reality hardware such as its headsets, as well as software and related content, posted a fourth-quarter operating loss of $4.28 billion, compared with a loss of $3.3 billion a year earlier.

            Though revenue declined, Meta continued to add users on its social media apps. Facebook's daily active users hit 2 billion for the first time — up 4% from a year earlier. Facebook had 2.96 billion monthly active users at the end of the year. Meta's monthly active users on what it calls its “family” of apps — Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp and Messenger — were 3.74 billion as of Dec. 31.

            ""The growth in monthly users is ... a good sign that there is still a small pool of new social network users (or perhaps lapsed users) who are willing to give Facebook a try,” Williamson said. 

            For the current quarter, Meta is forecasting revenue between $26 billion and $28.5 billion. Analysts are expecting $27.18 billion. The company also lowered its outlook for 2023 expenses to the range of $89 billion to $95 billion from its earlier guidance of $94 billion to $100 billion.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797637,Judge hikes bail for Army vet accused of threat to synagogue,"LAS VEGAS (AP) — A courtroom outburst by a man accused of telephoning threats to “shoot up” a Southern Nevada synagogue prompted a judge to increase his bail on Wednesday, despite the man’s father’s account that his son is a military veteran with “a mental issue” resulting from head injuries.

            Michael Sanchez, 37, blurted out a complaint about “false information being presented on both sides about my issues” before Las Vegas Justice of the Peace Amy Chelini told him she was increasing his bail amount from $20,000 to $100,000.

            “Those are alleged threats,” Sanchez said of accounts of his actions, prompting prosecutor Max Anderson to note for the judge that Sanchez appeared to admit guilt.











            Sanchez faces a felony charge of threatening an act of terrorism. He was not asked to enter a plea, pending a preliminary hearing of evidence scheduled Feb. 15.

            Chelini also ruled that if Sanchez can post bail for release from jail, he must be on high-level electronic monitoring.

            The judge told Sanchez her decisions were ""based upon this conduct here today and how you’re acting now to this court, to your attorneys, in the courtroom and the violent nature of the tone of your voice.""

            Sanchez was arrested Sunday, after police said he called the Chabad of Southern Nevada, told a rabbi that congregants were child molesters who deserved to die, and referred to a shooting in April 2019 at Chabad of Poway, California, that killed a 60-year-old woman and wounded three others, including a rabbi and an 8-year-old girl.

            Police said that following his arrest, Sanchez “admitted he made the call and did threaten to shoot up the synagogue,” and said he believed Jews and police were “out to get him.” Police also noted that Sanchez showed signs of paranoia.

            In court, Anderson said allegations that Sanchez also threatened another Las Vegas-area synagogue were being investigated. The prosecutor did not provide details.

            Sanchez’s verbal protest came after his father, also named Michael Sanchez, told the judge his son “may be a little crazy, but he’s not dangerous.”

            “He’s never carried out anything to anybody,” the elder Sanchez said. “He just talks.”

            Outside court, father Michael Sanchez of Hemet, California, said his son took part in heavy fighting in Iraq during two combat tours as a U.S. Army artillery officer before he was honorably discharged at the rank of sergeant.

            “He’s a veteran and he’s got a mental issue,” the father said, attributing his son’s mood swings to a head injury received after returning to the U.S. and a diagnosed brain aneurysm. “They’ve held him at the Veterans Administration psych ward several times already,"" he said.

            Separately, Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson said he believed Sanchez would pose an ongoing threat to the community if he were released from jail.

            “I recognize there may be indications of a mental illness,” Wolfson told The Associated Press. “But I can’t take the chance of this person acting out, regardless of whether he’s mentally ill or not.”LAS VEGAS (AP) — A courtroom outburst by a man accused of telephoning threats to “shoot up” a Southern Nevada synagogue prompted a judge to increase his bail on Wednesday, despite the man’s father’s account that his son is a military veteran with “a mental issue” resulting from head injuries.Michael Sanchez, 37, blurted out a complaint about “false information being presented on both sides about my issues” before Las Vegas Justice of the Peace Amy Chelini told him she was increasing his bail amount from $20,000 to $100,000.“Those are alleged threats,” Sanchez said of accounts of his actions, prompting prosecutor Max Anderson to note for the judge that Sanchez appeared to admit guilt.Sanchez faces a felony charge of threatening an act of terrorism.

            Offensive lineman O’Cyrus Torrence followed his coach, Billy Napier, from Louisiana-Lafayette to Florida and proved he could thrive against Southeastern Conference competition. He could get rewarded with being a first-round pick in April — and doesn’t have to answer questions about the level of competition he faced.











            “I feel like it shows that I’m more versatile than it originally seemed, and that I could hold my own against bigger, faster players,” said Torrence, an All-SEC selection. “And just different looks and different things I faced in the SEC. It just shows that I’m ready to hit the ground running with whatever team drafted me.”

            The transfer floodgates opened wide after the NCAA’s April 2021 rule change meant they wouldn’t have to sit out a year at another FBS school. It’s created some more opportunities for players and a chance for more homework from NFL teams, which can evaluate how players made the transition from one system to another and get feedback from multiple college coaching staffs.

            “We try to keep up with it as best as we can,” said Matt Groh, the New England Patriots’ player personnel director. “But you can look out there and there are countless number of players from this school, he was at that school.

            “We keep up with all that, and really it’s just another group of coaches, support staff from different schools (and we) get their opinions and their input on a prospect. You can be at one school and have four different offensive coordinators, though, so that’s the way it is here these days. These kids have got to learn to adapt.”

            Some do it better than others. The Senior Bowl and East-West Shrine Game rosters are loaded with players who played for multiple college teams in bids for more playing time, better personal situations or chances to improve their NFL draft stock. It's likely too early to tell how the increased movement affects players' transition to the NFL.

            Several first-rounders in last year's draft were transfers, including ex-Alabama and Ohio State wide receiver Jameson Williams, Florida State defensive end Jermaine Johnson Jr. (via Georgia) and Boston College guard Zion Johnson, who started his college career at Davidson.

            Zion Johnson became an immediate starter for the Los Angeles Chargers, Williams missed most of the Detroit Lions' season while recovering from a knee injury and Jermaine Johnson played in 14 games for the New York Jets.

            This season's prospects include some who clearly took advantage of their new situations.

            Linebacker Daiyan Henley went from second-team All-Midwest Conference as a Nevada junior to first-team All-Pac-12 and a Butkus Award finalist at Washington State.

            Ivan Pace Jr. became Cincinnati’s first unanimous All-American after moving 40 miles down Highway 27 from Miami, Ohio. Both are projected as likely mid-round picks.

            Tennessee quarterback Hendon Hooker emerged as a Heisman Trophy candidate in his second season after transferring from Virginia Tech. Hooker’s season ended with a torn ACL, leaving him as a bystander at the Senior Bowl practices in between meetings with NFL teams.

            He’s not sure he would have reached that point without the move.

            “It’s a long shot,” Hooker said. Also a long shot, but not out of the question: him being a first-rounder, though most projections have him closer to the third.

            How transfers handle the switch is more information for NFL teams to sort through. Jim Nagy, the Senior Bowl’s executive director and a former scout, said evaluating how players handled the transition from high school to college had been part of the process. Now, it’s frequently how did they adapt to changing college teams.

            Plus, he said, sometimes the staffs at different schools have very different takes on a player.

            “I think there’s more benefits sometimes from an NFL perspective, getting guys that have transferred and been through that, more positives than negatives,” Nagy said.

            Like Groh, Atlanta Falcons special teams coordinator Marquice Williams pointed out that sometimes players can stick it out at one school but still go through several different position coaches.

            “The more things that you’re exposed to, the more you’re able to grow,” Williams said. “And that’s if that person is willing to grow from those situations.”

            Cornerback Keidron Smith moved from Mississippi to Kentucky for his fifth year after logging 29 career starts in 47 games for the Rebels.

            “Just talking to the scouts, they really said I made a great decision,” Smith said. “Even my coaches at Kentucky said the decision to transfer was a momentum shift for me in this process.”

            Kansas defensive end Lonnie Phelps transferred from Miami, Ohio, for his final season. He had a ready answer for NFL teams wanting to know about the move.

            “All of them ask me why I transferred and I just tell them exactly the same thing: Kansas was just the icing on the cake and I’m an undersized defensive end and obviously they want to see me against bigger and better competition,” Phelps said.

            Now, Phelps & Co. are hoping those decisions prove beneficial in the draft.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797643,Ex-aide says Elon Musk had 'handshake deal' for Tesla buyout,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Elon Musk's former chief of staff on Wednesday testified that the billionaire believed he had a “handshake deal"" to take Tesla private in 2018 shortly before he tweeted he had the financing for an aborted buyout that is still haunting him in a high-profile trial.

            Sam Teller, who worked closely Musk from 2014 to 2019, detailed a series of meetings that his former boss held with representatives from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. His remarks came during testimony that also shed light on the quirks of a billionaire who runs Tesla, rocket ship maker SpaceX and Twitter. 

            Among other things, Teller said he sometimes had to “soften"" Musk's blunt emails. Teller attributed Musk's brusque manner to Asperger's syndrome, a form of autism that Musk acknowledged having during a May 2021 television appearance hosting “Saturday Night Live."" 











            Teller's testimony came on the ninth day of a trial triggered by a class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of Tesla shareholders alleging Musk misled them with tweets in August 2018. In the tweets, Musk indicated he had locked up the money to lead a buyout of the electric automaker, ending its then eight-year history as a publicly held company. The case is scheduled to be turned over to the nine-person jury Friday.

            Musk, 51, spent much of his roughly eight hours on the witness stand earlier in the trial maintaining he had a valid reason for disclosing he had “ funding secured"" for a Tesla buyout in an Aug. 7, 2018 tweet at $420 deal — a price that valued the electric automaker at $72 billion at that time.

            Teller was summoned to the stand Wednesday by Musk's lawyers in an attempt to substantiate and elaborate upon the billionaire's testimony. 

            In the last of five meetings held with Saudi fund that began in January 2017, Teller said Musk became increasingly excited as he discussed taking Tesla private with Yasir al-Rumayyan, a governor for the Saudi fund, during a July 31, 2018 meeting. 

            Although specific financing amounts were discussed, Teller recalled Musk pointing out to al-Rumayyan that taking Tesla private would be expensive.

            “Yasir was, like, ‘Don't worry about it, we've got a lot of money,'” Teller said.

            As he watched the two men happily conclude their meeting, Teller said, “It was my sense they made a handshake deal to proceed"" with taking Tesla private.

            A week later, Musk tweeted he had the money for the buyout shortly after being alerted that the Financial Times was about to publish a story disclosing the Saudi fund had built a 5% stake in Tesla — a stake that he knew about but hadn't been publicly announced.

            Amid widespread confusion about whether Musk’s Twitter account had been hacked or he was joking, Musk followed up a few hours later with another tweet suggesting a deal was imminent.

            The prospect of Tesla stock being sold caused the shares to soar during a 10-day period covered by the shareholder lawsuit that led to the current trial. The stock price dropped after Musk scrapped the going-private proposal, resulting in billions of dollars in losses, based on the estimates provided in testimony by an economist hired by the shareholder attorneys as an expert witness in the trial.

            After the Securities and Exchange Commission alleged Musk's tweets were misleading, he and Tesla reached a $40 million settlement in September 2018 without acknowledging wrongdoing. U.S. District Judge Edward Chen, who is presiding over the current trial, also has declared Musk's tweets to be falsehoods, leaving it to the jurors to decide if he posted them recklessly.

            During his testimony, Teller revealed that Musk doesn't like anyone filtering information for him. “He is the type of CEO who likes to absorb his communications,"" Teller said.

            Even so, Teller likened his job to an air traffic controller confronted with “a lot of problem solving"" at all hours. “Most of my waking hours were working,"" Teller said, a grueling schedule that led him to stop working for Musk in 2019. “I was pretty tired and it was time to do something else,' Teller said.SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Elon Musk's former chief of staff on Wednesday testified that the billionaire believed he had a “handshake deal"" to take Tesla private in 2018 shortly before he tweeted he had the financing for an aborted buyout that is still haunting him in a high-profile trial.Sam Teller, who worked closely Musk from 2014 to 2019, detailed a series of meetings that his former boss held with representatives from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797644,Police: Oregon kidnap suspect killed 2 men before cornered,"SALEM, Ore. (AP) — The suspect in a violent kidnapping in Oregon — a man who spent little time behind bars for a similar crime in Nevada — killed two men before being cornered by officers and fatally shooting himself, police said Wednesday.

            Benjamin Obadiah Foster, 36, died at a hospital Tuesday night, hours after he shot himself while hiding in a crawlspace underneath a house in Grants Pass. In a news conference the next day, law enforcement officers revealed details on the intensive manhunt for Foster, including finding the bodies of the two men in a rural area north of Grants Pass.

            Richard Lee Barron Jr., and Donald Owen Griffith were killed sometime between Monday afternoon and Tuesday morning, Oregon State Police Capt. Kyle Kennedy said.











            The men lived together in the unincorporated community of Sunny Valley and apparently did not know Foster, who police said left a gruesome scene and stole some of the victims’ belongings, including their dog. 

            He had been the subject of a manhunt after a woman was found unconscious, bound and near death in a house in Grants Pass on Jan. 24. Authorities say Foster tortured the woman, who remained hospitalized in critical condition on Wednesday.

            Foster was seen walking a dog Tuesday in Grants Pass, according to police. 

            Authorities converged on the neighborhood with rifles and at least one armored vehicle and searched the house where they had found the woman the previous week. Officers didn't initially find anyone, but then they sent a sheriff's department robot into the crawlspace and found signs Foster was hiding there. His presence was confirmed by a camera, Grants Pass Police Chief Warren Hensman said.

            The officers expected a gunfight, but instead Foster shot himself in the head, according to Hensman. Foster was said to be unconscious and still holding a .45-caliber pistol while wedged under the house, and officers had to remove floorboards to extract him.

            The fugitive had narrowly eluded a raid last Thursday in the unincorporated community of Wolf Creek, and police warned the public the next day that he was using dating apps to find people who could help him avoid authorities or to find new victims. 

            Foster then was seen Tuesday in the same neighborhood where the woman was found. He barricaded himself under the same house as police arrived in full force. Foster then shot himself, was taken into custody and died at a hospital, police said.

            In 2019, before moving to Oregon, Foster held his then-girlfriend captive inside her Las Vegas apartment for two weeks. He reached a deal with Clark County prosecutors in August 2021 that allowed him to plead guilty to one felony count of battery and a misdemeanor count of battery constituting domestic violence.

            A judge sentenced Foster to between one and 2 1/2 years in a Nevada prison. After factoring in the 729 days he had spent in jail awaiting trial, Foster could have been made to serve almost 200 additional days under the maximum sentence. Instead, he was released the day he was brought to prison, according to Nevada corrections department officials.

            Hensman said last week that it was “extremely troubling” that Foster wound up being sought for attempted murder in Oregon instead of doing time in Nevada.

            The attack on the woman and ensuing search by local, state and federal agents has rattled residents of Grants Pass, a town of some 40,000 in southwest Oregon.SALEM, Ore.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797646,McCarthy set to call plays for Cowboys after Moore departure,"MOBILE, Ala. (AP) — Dallas Cowboys coach Mike McCarthy is set to call plays in 2023 after the club parted ways with offensive coordinator Kellen Moore.

            Owner/general manager Jerry Jones told reporters at the Senior Bowl on Wednesday that McCarthy will run a version of the West Coast offense he used when calling plays as head coach in Green Bay from 2006-18.

            Executive vice president of personnel Stephen Jones hinted at philosophical differences between McCarthy and Moore, who kept the play-calling role for three seasons after McCarthy was hired.











            The Los Angeles Chargers hired Moore as offensive coordinator Monday, a day after the Cowboys announced Moore's departure.

            The Cowboys haven't had the head coach calling plays since Jason Garrett gave up that role after the 2012 season. Moore's debut as offensive coordinator came in 2019, Garrett's final year in Dallas.

            McCarthy said he wanted to keep Moore as the play-caller because he thought it was the best thing for quarterback Dak Prescott.

            The Cowboys had one of the league's most productive offenses the past two seasons when Prescott was healthy. But they misfired on offense in playoff losses each time, most recently in a 19-12 divisional-round loss to San Francisco last month.

            McCarthy briefly gave up play-calling with the Packers, and said he'd never give up that role again after taking it back over. 

            He was fired midseason in 2018 and reversed course on that declaration after joining Dallas in 2020. Now McCarthy is back in that role.

            “This is the logical step to build on it and use what we’ve established, if you will, the foundation of the things we’ve got,” Jones told reporters in Mobile, Alabama. “This is the time for us to build on it. That’s what this is, a building step.”

            Moore's departure came a few days after the Cowboys announced six assistant coaches on expiring contracts wouldn't return.

            With McCarthy set to call plays, Dallas is still planning to hire an offensive coordinator. Among the interviews are Carolina's Jeff Nixon and Thomas Brown of the Los Angeles Rams. Both have been assistant head coaches, with Nixon in charge of running backs and Brown coaching tight ends.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797648,Hall of Fame NFL executive Bobby Beathard dies at 86,"Bobby Beathard, the architect of four Super Bowl-winning teams with two different organizations during his lengthy tenure in football, has died. He was 86.

            A spokesperson for the Washington Commanders said Beathard's family told the team he died Monday at his home in Franklin, Tennessee, less than a week after his 86th birthday. A cause of death was not immediately available.

            Beathard was director of player personnel for two of the NFL championships by Miami in the 1970s and served as general manager for two more by Washington in the ’80s. He also scouted for Kansas City when the Chiefs won the American Football League title and made Super Bowl I following the 1966 season and was GM with San Diego when the Chargers got there in the mid-1990s.











            Part of seven teams that made the Super Bowl during his lengthy front office career, Beathard was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2018. Washington added him to the organization's Ring of Honor in 2016.

            “Bobby not only built winning teams throughout his career, but he also built winning cultures that lasted beyond his years with an organization,” Pro Football Hall of Fame president Jim Porter said in a statement. “He combined an eye for talent with a special gift for working with other people. The results speak for themselves.”

            Beathard also scouted for the Atlanta Falcons, but is most known for his roles with Don Shula's Dolphins that won the Super Bowl back-to-back and then hiring coach Joe Gibbs and drafting Darrell Green, Art Monk and others during his time in Washington.

            “I came to the Redskins from the Miami Dolphins, and the years at the Miami Dolphins including the ’72 season of undefeated teams and being with Shula, I learned a lot more than I ever had up until that time about football,” Beathard said in 2016 at Washington's training camp in Richmond, Virginia. “So I felt coming into a situation like this that I felt prepared because I never wanted to go into a situation that I felt was too big for me or where I wasn’t prepared.”

            Beathard resigned from that job in 1989, before Washington won a third Super Bowl with a core he constructed, and went into TV before being hired as GM of the Chargers in 1990. He spent a decade with them, including overseeing the team that went to the Super Bowl before losing to the San Francisco 49ers, though he nearly resigned before that 1994 season because of a dispute with owner Alex Spanos.

            But Spanos’ son, Dean, stepped in and was put in charge of the day-to-day operations. Beathard stayed, and the Chargers reached their only Super Bowl in franchise history.

            Now owner and chairman of the Chargers, Dean Spanos in a statement called Beathard “one of the best judges of football talent in NFL history.""

            “He was the best GM in football, but he was also the guy sitting on his surfboard in the ocean that you caught waves with, jogged trails alongside and chatted up in the checkout line of the local market,” Spanos said. “He was just a regular guy who happened to be anything but. Bobby was, in fact, exceptional. He was one of a kind. And he will be incredibly missed.”

            Beathard in more than three decades in an NFL front office loathed first-round picks and reveled in taking chances on players from out-of-the-way colleges, a strategy that paid off along the way. In 1988, Sports Illustrated called him “The Smartest Man in the NFL"" — a title he did not like.

            “That was kind of embarrassing,” Beathard said in 2018 before going into the Hall of Fame. “Whoever put that in there, I told them when it first came out, ‘Well, you better go back and ask my high school and college teachers if that’s true, and I don’t think they’d agree with that.’""

            In a statement expressing their condolences, the Commanders called Beathard “a man of extraordinary class and integrity"" and said he “cared deeply about everyone he worked with and always put the team first.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797649,"Man United beats Forest 2-0, reaches 1st final with Ten Hag","MANCHESTER, England (AP) — Erik ten Hag was hired to bring the good times back to Manchester United.

            Now, just nine months after his appointment, he is one game away from ending the club’s six-year trophy wait.

            A 2-0 win against Nottingham Forest on Wednesday sealed a 5-0 aggregate victory in the League Cup semifinals.











            
                United will face Newcastle in the final at Wembley Stadium on Feb. 26 for the English season’s first piece of major silverware.

            “It is good to reach the final of course, but it is not about reaching the final, it is about winning it,” Ten Hag said. “It has to give huge motivation to us and we want to bring that cup (back).”

            Substitute Anthony Martial opened the scoring in the 73rd minute and Fred added a second in the 76th, with both goals set up by Marcus Rashford. United won the first leg 3-0 at the City Ground last week.

            “When you get this far you want to go one further. The damage was really done last week,” Forest manager Steve Cooper said.

            Ten Hag has not made United fans wait long for a first cup final under him.

            The Dutchman took charge last April and was given the task of turning the club’s fortunes around after too long in the shadows of fierce rivals Manchester City and Liverpool.

            The League Cup was the earliest possible final he could reach and victory in the showpiece occasion later this month would further fuel belief that he is building a team capable of competing for the biggest prizes in club soccer again.

            United has not won a trophy since 2017 when former manager Jose Mourinho triumphed in the League Cup and Europa League in his first season in charge.

            While Ten Hag can emulate the Portuguese coach by also winning a trophy in his debut campaign with United, his ultimate challenge is to deliver Premier League and Champions League titles.

            Those were standards set by managerial great Alex Ferguson and ones United has not come close to meeting since his retirement in 2013.

            Ten Hag is the fifth permanent managerial appointment since then and took over a team that finished sixth last season, 35 points below champion City.

            A title bid was always unlikely this year, but United is in a strong position to qualify for the Champions League, currently fourth in the table and still competing in the FA Cup and Europa League.

            “We have a good squad so we have to demand and control the high standards. You have to bring that every game. We are Manchester United. When you are a United player you have to match the standards,” Ten Hag said.

            For a club that has won an English record 20 league titles, a League Cup final is a long way short of its greatest achievements. Old Trafford, however, was in party mood in anticipation of a trip to Wembley.

            Supporters expected United to comfortably complete the job after taking such a commanding lead into the second leg.

            Yet Forest came close to opening the scoring in the first half, only for Emmanuel Dennis’ close-range shot to be blocked by teammate Sam Surridge when the ball looked destined to find the back of the net.

            United striker Wout Weghorst then saw a header come back off the post.

            Ten Hag made changes, bringing on Rashford, Martial and Jadon Sancho shortly past the hour mark.

            It had the desired effect with Rashford setting up goals for Martial and Fred.

            United can expect a tougher challenge from a Newcastle team aiming to win its first major trophy since the FA Cup in 1955.

            The Saudi-backed club has been one of the biggest surprises of the season, sitting third in the Premier League, one place above United.

            The match will be a repeat of the 1999 FA Cup final, which United won 2-0.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797650,"Hochul's $227B budget helps NYC transit, migrant response","ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — New York Gov. Kathy Hochul proposed dramatic spending to help New York City handle a wave of international migrants and to stabilize its reeling public transit system with her $227 billion state budget Wednesday, even as she warned of tougher economic times ahead.

            The wide-ranging spending plan also includes a public university tuition hike, a 10% jump in school aid and a proposal to yet again revise state bail law, which is expected to meet resistance from liberal state lawmakers. The proposal kicks off weeks of intense negotiations with state legislative leaders as they try to agree on a finalized budget by the April 1 deadline.

            Hochul said caring for new migrants and the solvency of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs subways and other public transit in the downstate region, are among the most pressing issues facing the state. The MTA has been dealing with lower ridership and revenues since the pandemic. 











            “The New York City economy drives the state of New York, MTA helps drive the New York City economy. So it’s critically important to all of us,” Hochul said during her budget presentation. 

            Hochul's MTA package relies in part on increasing a payroll tax on city-area employers to raise $800 million annually. She also wants the authority to receive a share of state money that will come in from up three new casinos planned for the New York City region.

            Hochul called for $1 billion in “extraordinary funding” to provide services and help with migrant resettlement, with the costs divided among the state, city and federal government. Hochul said President Joe Biden assured her there would be federal money to help the city, though she said “he did not give a number.”

            Mayor Eric Adams has said that the city has been overwhelmed with new arrivals and has criticized the practice of some governors who transport migrants straight from the border to the city.

            “We will continue to need our federal and state partners to do their part, and we look forward to working in partnership with them,” Adams said in a prepared statement that commended his fellow Democrat for committing state resources.

            Adams also said the governor's proposal to have the city contribute about $500 million more annually for the MTA “could further strain our already-limited resources.”

            The spending plan includes a number of policies announced last month during the Democratic governor's State of the State address, including $1 billion to provide psychiatric beds and services for people with mental illnesses and a plan to spur the creation of 800,000 new homes, in part through changes in zoning rules.

            Hochul made the spending proposals even with a possible national recession looming. State tax collections are expected to fall in the coming fiscal year and the administration projected multibillion-dollar, out-year budget gaps. 

            Acting state budget director Sandra Beattie said a current $8.7 billion surplus will help the state weather an economic downturn.

            The budget would raise the state cigarette tax from $4.35 to $5.35 per pack. Washington, D.C., currently has the highest excise tax nationwide at $4.50, according to the Federation of Tax Administrators. 

            The budget would also prohibit the sale of all flavored tobacco products, as opposed to just flavored vaping products. The administration said the moves will reduce the number of young smokers.

            Under Hochul's proposal, state and city colleges could increase tuition annually by either 3% or an amount tied to the Higher Education Price Index, whichever is less. The state’s university centers would have the flexibility to raise tuition 6 percentage points above the system’s base tuition rate each year for the next five years for in-state students.

            State Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie said the tuition increase proposal is one that would be “tough” for the conference during budget deliberations.

            “We don’t want tuition to be raised on the students. We’re going to have to figure out a way to pay for it,” the Democrat said.

            Hochul also wants to make more revisions to the state’s bail law, which was changed in 2019 to do away with pretrial incarceration of people accused of most nonviolent offenses. The law has been tweaked since, but Republicans and some moderate Democrats continue to argue the rules have deprived judges of a tool they could use to hold people who are likely to commit new crimes.

            Budget briefing documents say Hochul wants to give judges greater discretion by removing the “least restrictive means” standard to ensure a defendant returns to court, as opposed to considering how dangerous they appear. The governor said the current guidelines are not always clear and that she wants to provide “clarity for the judges.”

            State Sen. Jessica Ramos, a Democrat who represents Queens, gave a frosty response to the bail proposal. 

            “I am not keen on budging on any of the bail reform work that we have done,” Ramos said. “It is incomplete work and I am hoping that the response is to actually build the mental healthcare facilities that we need so New Yorkers who are engaging in harm-doing can actually receive the services and given the treatment that they deserve.”

(AP) — New York Gov. Kathy Hochul proposed dramatic spending to help New York City handle a wave of international migrants and to stabilize its reeling public transit system with her $227 billion state budget Wednesday, even as she warned of tougher economic times ahead.The wide-ranging spending plan also includes a public university tuition hike, a 10% jump in school aid and a proposal to yet again revise state bail law, which is expected to meet resistance from liberal state lawmakers. The proposal kicks off weeks of intense negotiations with state legislative leaders as they try to agree on a finalized budget by the April 1 deadline.Hochul said caring for new migrants and the solvency of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs subways and other public transit in the downstate region, are among the most pressing issues facing the state.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797651,Mother of slain 13-year-old says shooting was unnecessary,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The mother of a 13-year-old boy who was killed while breaking into parked cars said Wednesday that she wanted “justice for my child” and claimed the resident charged in connection with his death set the violence in motion by opening fire when he was not under any threat.

            “It could have gone a whole different way,” said Londen Blake, whose son Karon was killed on Jan. 7. Facing community uproar over the shooting, police charged Jason Lewis, a longtime Parks and Recreation Department employee, with second-degree murder while armed. 

            The arrest warrant says Karon, a seventh grader, was part of a group of youths apparently robbing parked cars, and that he ran straight toward Lewis before Lewis opened fire. The charges don’t hinge directly on the shots that killed Blake, but rather on an earlier gunshot that Lewis didn’t mention in his initial statement to police.











            Londen Blake, who has three younger children, did not dispute the police contention that her son was part of a group of youths breaking into cars at 4 a.m. 

            “Kids do things that parents aren't always aware of,” she said. “But Karon came from a good home.” 

            Lewis is charged with firing first at a young man from the group who remained seated in what turned out to be a stolen car. In the confusion after that first shot, Karon Blake apparently ran directly toward Lewis and was fatally wounded.

            “The first shot was fired ... at someone sitting in a vehicle who wasn’t an immediate threat,” Police Chief Robert Contee said on Tuesday. This original shot, when Lewis had no claim of being personally under threat, was “where things really unraveled” and “put the chain of events into place” that resulted in the youth’s death, Contee said.

            Lewis' attorney maintains that his client acted in self-defense. He is being held without bond pending a Feb. 13 court date. 

            Contee has encouraged the youths who were with Blake that night to come forward to police with their own testimony. But he has stopped short of promising any sort of amnesty from criminal charges.

            “My assessment is that these young men obviously need some sort of intervention,” he said Tuesday. “Ï want to make sure they get what they need.”

            Londen Blake's lawyer, Brian McDaniel, disputed that characterization Wednesday. 

            “I would say that they are in need in support, he said. ”They're in need of direction and sometimes they are in need of forgiveness."" 

            McDaniel said his office planned to “keep a close eye on the prosecution.” 

            “Mr. Lewis was not responding to any threat. Mr. Lewis was probably angry,” he said. 

            Mayor Muriel Bowser made an apparent reference to the Blake shooting Wednesday when discussing another shooting in which a gunman killed one person and wounded two others before being forcibly disarmed by the passengers on a Metro train. 

            “We’re focused on how we get guns out of our city,” Bowser said. “Whether it’s the Metro, it’s the street, it’s in individual homes, we know that we have guns that are creating tragedies in our city and in our nation.”WASHINGTON (AP) — The mother of a 13-year-old boy who was killed while breaking into parked cars said Wednesday that she wanted “justice for my child” and claimed the resident charged in connection with his death set the violence in motion by opening fire when he was not under any threat.“It could have gone a whole different way,” said Londen Blake, whose son Karon was killed on Jan. 7.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797652,Violence frustrates historic Black cultural hub in Baltimore,"BALTIMORE (AP) — Joe Johnson-Winfield remembers when west Baltimore’s Pennsylvania Avenue attracted locals and tourists alike to its renowned jazz clubs, upscale shops and vibrant nightlife. Back then, the bustling commercial strip, also known as The Avenue, was a Black cultural hub frequented by civil rights leaders.

            Over a half-century later, nearly everything has changed. 

            On his way to the store for cat food Monday morning, Johnson-Winfield walked past the scene of a Saturday evening shootout that killed two people and left three others injured. 











            At least one of the gunshot victims, a young mother, was an apparent bystander. She was waiting for takeout with her two small children when gunfire broke out, according to police. She tried to drive away, but a bullet left her critically wounded behind the wheel. Her vehicle continued down the block before crashing into a pole. The children — a baby and a toddler — both suffered serious injuries from the crash. The woman died Monday in the hospital, police said. 

            Less than two weeks earlier, a man was stabbed to death at the same busy intersection, which includes a subway stop, corner stores and other businesses. 

            The brazen displays of violence left residents on edge, worried for their safety and further frustrated at the current state of Baltimore’s Upton neighborhood, which emerged during segregation as a bastion of Black culture and entertainment. Its cultural artifacts include the childhood home of Thurgood Marshall, the first African American appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court, and a bronze statue of jazz legend Billie Holiday, who also had roots in west Baltimore and performed at nearby clubs. 

            But since Upton’s heyday, the area has experienced a steady decline driven by urban flight and growing disinvestment. 

            “It breaks your heart,” said Johnson-Winfield, 65, a semi-retired hair stylist and lifelong resident of the area. 

            He gestured toward nearby blighted buildings and overgrown lots, familiar signs of poverty in an environment largely defined by the local drug trade and its devastating impacts: addiction, homelessness and violence. People were milling around on the sidewalks, some exhibiting obvious signs of substance abuse.

            Several makeshift memorials commemorated the recent victims with balloons, candles, liquor bottles, stuffed animals and photos. Trash bins lined the sidewalk, overflowing with discarded yellow crime tape.

            “This city is just one big memorial, candlelight vigils every week,” Johnson-Winfield said, shaking his head sadly at the number of young men carrying guns and resorting to violence in Baltimore, which recently recorded over 300 annual homicides for the eighth consecutive year.

            After losing younger relatives to gun violence, he sees no easy solution. He believes police officers should do more to address obvious criminal activity, but he also acknowledged the challenges they face, especially in areas that seem heavily saturated with guns and drugs. 

            The Upton of his childhood was a different place altogether. The neighborhood rose to prominence in the early 1900s and its heyday lasted into the ’50s and ’60s.

            “It was a hub,” Johnson-Winfield said. “On Friday and Saturday nights, people would get dressed to the nines and hit The Avenue.” 

            He recalled shopping with his family and sampling different cuisines at their local public market. The food hall now sits largely vacant next to the Upton subway stop, with several nearby corner stores and takeout joints offering little more than fast food, he griped. But officials announced plans last year to renovate the building, an investment they hope will spur additional revitalization in what was once Baltimore’s preeminent Black business district, filled with retail shops, grocery stores and restaurants.

            Other initiatives to preserve Upton history and stimulate positive development are ongoing, including its designation in 2019 as an arts and entertainment district, which officials said would provide tax breaks and other incentives to attract artists. But after witnessing decades of decline, Johnson-Winfield and other residents are skeptical. 

            He said some business owners left the area after social unrest broke out along Pennsylvania Avenue following the 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., when the area experienced widespread looting and destruction. A confluence of factors helped place the neighborhood on a downward trajectory, he said.

            Adrian Ferrell, a local minister, said the recent violence pushes him to keep showing up in underserved Baltimore communities, trying to instill hope. 

            “How many more must die for some to live,” he bellowed into a microphone Monday afternoon at the scene of Saturday’s shooting. He questioned how the city would respond if more of its homicide victims were white. 

            Ferrell said he speaks openly about his past transgressions, including drug sales and other crimes, because he wants to show people change is possible.

            But many young men growing up in poverty struggle to envision a future beyond the environment they’re raised in, said Kenneth Taylor, 58, who often hangs out along Pennsylvania Avenue. He said the community needs more help and called on city leaders to invest more in after school programs, recreation centers and job opportunities for youth. 

            “In Baltimore, you’ve got the haves and the have-nots,” Taylor said — often with just a few blocks separating them in a city crisscrossed by stark racial and economic divides.

            To address a surge in gun violence that began in the wake of Freddie Gray’s 2015 death in Baltimore police custody, city leaders have pursued a number of initiatives and increased funding of existing anti-violence efforts. Last year, they reorganized a mediation program that deploys violence interrupters to intervene in disputes and launched a “focused deterrence” strategy that offers services, mentoring and other supports to young men at high risk of violence. 

            Outside the Upton subway station Monday morning, Taylor pointed to a sign that describes the neighborhood’s “glory days” and directs visitors to learn more about the “Baltimore African Americans who helped build the city and changed the face of American music, art, literature and politics.” 

            Several yards away, blue and orange balloons commemorated the man who died from stab wounds in early January in a display of violence that occurred during daylight hours. Police later released surveillance video showing two suspects leaving the scene, but they haven’t announced any arrests. 

            When gunfire erupted Saturday evening, two men were injured, one fatally, while standing outside near the intersection, according to Baltimore police. Moments later, a group of people fired back from a short distance away. The young mother killed was caught in the crossfire while trying to escape with her children.

            Baltimore Police Commissioner Michael Harrison said detectives are investigating who was the intended target. 

            “What we need right now is information from our community,” Harrison said at the scene Saturday. “We know people heard something. We know people saw something.” 

            Police released surveillance images Tuesday morning showing three suspects who allegedly returned fire after the initial gunshots. 

            Mayor Brandon Scott, a Baltimore native who has made public safety a top priority for his administration, called on Black men to stand together against gun violence. He questioned when people will stop shooting each other over petty disputes.

            “We as a community, as people, we’ve got to be better,” he said.BALTIMORE (AP) — Joe Johnson-Winfield remembers when west Baltimore’s Pennsylvania Avenue attracted locals and tourists alike to its renowned jazz clubs, upscale shops and vibrant nightlife.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797653,Democratic-backed Connecticut bill would ban 'Latinx' term,"HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — A group of Hispanic lawmakers in Connecticut has proposed that the state follow Arkansas' lead and ban the term “Latinx” from official government documents, calling it offensive to Spanish speakers.

            The word is used as a gender-neutral alternative to “Latino” and “Latina"" and is helpful in supporting people who do not identify as either male or female, according to the word's backers.

            But state Rep. Geraldo Reyes Jr. of Waterbury, the bill's chief sponsor and one of five Hispanic Democrats who put their names on the legislation, said Latinx is not a Spanish word but is rather a “woke” term that is offensive to Connecticut's large Puerto Rican population. 











            “I'm of Puerto Rican descent and I find it offensive,"" he said.

            Last month, Arkansas banned government officials from using Latinx on formal documents as part of several orders issued by Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders within hours of her taking office.

            Reyes said his motivations might be different from Sanders', but he believes her decision was the right one. 

            The League of United Latin American Citizens, the oldest Latino civil rights group in the U.S., announced in 2021 that it would no longer use the term Latinx. 

            “The Spanish language, which is centuries old, defaults to Latino for everybody,"" Reyes said. “It's all-inclusive. They didn't need to create a word, it already exists.” 

            But Maia Gil'Adi, an assistant professor of “Latinx and Multiethnic Literature” at Boston University, said the word actually dates back to Latino and Latina youth and queer culture in the 1990s, with the “x” being a nod to many people's indigenous roots. 

            “The word Latino is incredibly exclusionary, both for women and for non-gender conforming people,” she said. “And the term Latinx is really useful because of the way it challenges those conceptions.”

            David Pharies, a Spanish language professor at the University of Florida, said another movement would replace the “o"" and “a” in many Spanish nouns referring to people with an “e.” He said that is something that would be easier for Spanish-speakers to pronounce than the word Latinx.

            “Latinx was clearly a solution that was proposed outside the Spanish-speaking world,” he said. 

            It's not clear how often the term Latinx has been used in state documents. A search for the word on the state government's portal returned 945 hits for documents including press releases, blogs, and reports using the word. Michelle Dumas Keuler, an attorney for the Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities, told Hearst Connecticut Media that it uses the term in any a complaint it submits about housing, employment or other types of discrimination, when requested.

            Reyes said he expects the bill to get a hearing before the Democratic-controlled Legislature's Government Administration and Elections Committee during the current session. 

            Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont’s spokesman, Adam Joseph, said the governor’s office will follow the debate as the bill moves through the Legislature.HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — A group of Hispanic lawmakers in Connecticut has proposed that the state follow Arkansas' lead and ban the term “Latinx” from official government documents, calling it offensive to Spanish speakers.The word is used as a gender-neutral alternative to “Latino” and “Latina"" and is helpful in supporting people who do not identify as either male or female, according to the word's backers.But state Rep. Geraldo Reyes Jr. of Waterbury, the bill's chief sponsor and one of five Hispanic Democrats who put their names on the legislation, said Latinx is not a Spanish word but is rather a “woke” term that is offensive to Connecticut's large Puerto Rican population.“I'm of Puerto Rican descent and I find it offensive,"" he said.Last month, Arkansas banned government officials from using Latinx on formal documents as part of several orders issued by Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders within hours of her taking office.Reyes said his motivations might be different from Sanders', but he believes her decision was the right one.The League of United Latin American Citizens, the oldest Latino civil rights group in the U.S., announced in 2021 that it would no longer use the term Latinx.“The Spanish language, which is centuries old, defaults to Latino for everybody,"" Reyes said. “It's all-inclusive. They didn't need to create a word, it already exists.”But Maia Gil'Adi, an assistant professor of “Latinx and Multiethnic Literature” at Boston University, said the word actually dates back to Latino and Latina youth and queer culture in the 1990s, with the “x” being a nod to many people's indigenous roots.“The word Latino is incredibly exclusionary, both for women and for non-gender conforming people,” she said. “And the term Latinx is really useful because of the way it challenges those conceptions.”David Pharies, a Spanish language professor at the University of Florida, said another movement would replace the “o"" and “a” in many Spanish nouns referring to people with an “e.” He said that is something that would be easier for Spanish-speakers to pronounce than the word Latinx.“Latinx was clearly a solution that was proposed outside the Spanish-speaking world,” he said.It's not clear how often the term Latinx has been used in state documents. A search for the word on the state government's portal returned 945 hits for documents including press releases, blogs, and reports using the word.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797654,"Stars aligned with new coach DeBoer, Nill-constructed roster","DALLAS (AP) — General manager Jim Nill sensed things were coming together for the Dallas Stars even before the season started with new coach Pete DeBoer and a roster mixed with proven veterans, up-and-coming young players and even a teenaged center.

            At the NHL’s All-Star break, after 51 games together, these Stars are leading the Western Conference.

            “Every year you start, you put a team together, and there’s always going to be question marks,” said Nill, in his 10th season as the Stars GM. “You have ideas how you think you’re going to come together, but there’s always the unknown. … This year has been one of those years where right from the start, you could just see everything was kind of jelling.”











            The Stars (28-13-10, 66 points) have their trio of 2017 draft picks that just keep getting better: All-Star winger Jason Robertson, goaltender Jake Oettinger and defenseman Miro Heiskanen. The seemingly ageless Joe Pavelski, at 38 and already re-signed for next season, is on the high-scoring top line with Robertson and point-a-game winger Roope Hintz. Wyatt Johnston, their first-round pick in 2021 and half Pavelski’s age, has 13 goals.

            There is also the resurgence of six-time All-Star forward Tyler Seguin two years after hip surgery and 33-year-old captain Jamie Benn, who already has more goals (19) than he did playing all 82 games last season.

            The Stars have a plus-40 goal differential, which is second-best in the NHL. They are averaging 3.37 goals per game, more than a half-goal better than last season when they were the only team to make the playoffs after being outscored in the regular season. They are also allowing fewer goals, and have improved on power plays and penalty kills.

            “Where we sit at this break, I think guys are happy with that,” Seguin said, before being asked the keys to the Stars leading the West and on pace for a 100-point season with their new coach.

            “Our style, our team speed, our puck speed, being predictable. All the clichés, knowing where the puck’s going. Really how we play the five-man unit,” he said. “Our pace this year, it’s been a lot quicker. There’s been some solid depth scoring this year while we’ve got one of the best lines in hockey.”

            The Stars went into the break on their only three-game losing streak of the season, all 3-2 overtime losses at home.

            “Those aren’t real losses,” said DeBoer, who twice has gone to the Stanley Cup Final in his first season with a new team. “I’m happy where we’re at. I like how we’re playing.”

            Plus, Dallas won’t have to worry in the playoffs about 3-on-3 hockey, which has been the only real stain on their season so far. Only one team has more than its 10 losses after regulation.

            “We’ve played a lot of good hockey. We’ve made a lot of good strides in our game,” DeBoer said. “We still have another level we have to get to when we get back, but there are a lot of good things that have happened. They’ve worked to have us where we are right now in the standings. … Good spot to be in.”

            The Stars have 31 games left in the regular season. The first four after the break at home, like the last four before their week-long hiatus.

            Robertson’s 33 goals rank sixth in the NHL, and the 23-year-old has the same number of assists while averaging 1.29 points a game even after he missed most of training camp before signing a $31 million, four-year contract. Pavelski has 48 points (14 goals, 34 assists) while playing every game, and Hintz 46 points (20 goals, 26 assists) in only 43 games.

            Oettinger, who is 21-7 in regulation, has a .923 save percentage and 2.26 goals against average since signing his $12 million, three-year contract. That deal came after 223 saves in a seven-game playoff series against Calgary last May, capped by 64 in the series finale that went to overtime.

            Nill said Robertson’s production has improved even with the league adjusting to the high-scoring forward, and that Oettinger is proving to be one of the league's best goalies. But they are just part of what has been a tremendous team effort.

            “They kind of had that mojo right from the start, and it was kind of this team’s got the right mix,” Nill said. “It’s come together well, and it’s shown in the standings. … It’s been good to watch.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797655,Child in California mountain lion attack leaves hospital,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A 5-year-old boy who was attacked by a mountain lion while hiking in rural Northern California with his mother and grandfather has been released from a hospital, authorities said Wednesday.

            The boy had raced ahead of the adults on a trail in San Mateo County, south of San Francisco, Tuesday when the big cat pounced on him and pinned him to the ground, said Capt. Patrick Foy, a spokesman with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.

            “The little boy was pretty viciously attacked by a mountain lion that took him to the ground,” Foy said. 











            San Mateo County authorities said the boy had puncture wounds. Foy earlier Wednesday said the child had been bitten, but that after speaking to his mother investigators are no longer sure.

            “He was pretty severely scratched. But whether he was bitten or not, I can’t confirm that at this time,” he said. 

            Foy said the boy fought the mountain lion and tried to free himself, but the animal only let go after the child's mother charged at it. 

            “Right before she even made physical contact with the lion, the lion released the little boy,” Foy said. 

            The child was released from Stanford Medical Center Tuesday evening, he said. 

            The attack was reported shortly before 7 p.m. on Tunitas Creek Road, south of Half Moon Bay. It occurred in a private property in a remote location east of Highway 1, the San Mateo County Sheriff’s Department said. 

            Foy said investigators have yet to get access to the property where the attack happened. He said they have collected the boy’s clothing and will check it for traces of saliva that could help them collect a DNA sample of the animal. 

            Mountain lion attacks on humans are rare. About 20 confirmed attacks have occurred in California in more than a century of record-keeping, according to the Department of Fish and Wildlife.

            Last September, a 7-year-old boy was bitten by a mountain lion while walking with his father around dusk in a park near Santa Clarita in Southern California. The father scared the animal away, and the child was treated for relatively minor wounds.SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A 5-year-old boy who was attacked by a mountain lion while hiking in rural Northern California with his mother and grandfather has been released from a hospital, authorities said Wednesday.The boy had raced ahead of the adults on a trail in San Mateo County, south of San Francisco, Tuesday when the big cat pounced on him and pinned him to the ground, said Capt.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797657,Cancelo helps Bayern beat Mainz 4-0 on debut in German Cup,"MAINZ, Germany (AP) — João Cancelo needed little time to make an impact for Bayern Munich as he helped his new team reach the quarterfinals of the German Cup with a 4-0 win at Mainz on Wednesday.

            The Portugal left back started on the right wing one day after joining on loan from Manchester City and he set up Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting to open the scoring in the 17th minute.

            It was Bayern’s first win of 2023 after re-starting the Bundesliga with three draws and the first time since 2020 the Bavarian powerhouse reached the German Cup quarterfinals.











            Cancelo made the most of some passive defending from Mainz as he lofted a cross to the far post for Choupo-Moting, then Thomas Müller set up Jamal Musiala to shoot in off the right post in the 30th.

            Joshua Kimmich struck the post with a free kick and Matthijs de Ligt missed another good chance as Bayern maintained its dominance.

            It got worse for Mainz before the break when captain Silvan Widmer had to go off injured and Choupo-Moting set up Leroy Sané to score.

            Mainz improved drastically for the second, but the visitors withstood the pressure and Kimmich delivered a free kick for Alphonso Davies to complete the scoring with a header in the 83rd.

            Mainz coach Bo Svensson had been sent off just before Davies' goal. Referee Deniz Aytekin said after the game that Svensson had asked the fourth official if they were all blind.

            Mainz defender Alexander Hack followed with his second yellow card in the 86th.

            Bayern visits Paris Saint-Germain for the first leg of their Champions League round of 16 tie on Feb. 14.

            Musiala limped off at the break but emerged to finish the game. Both de Ligt and Dutch compatriot Ryan Gravenberch needed attention after strong collisions in the second half. Both continued.

            Defending champion Leipzig earlier defeated Hoffenheim 3-1 to progress. Union Berlin and Stuttgart booked their quarterfinal places on Tuesday. There are more third-round games next week.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797659,Nuggets star Porter Jr.'s brother charged in fatal crash,"DENVER (AP) — University of Denver basketball player Coban Porter, the brother of Denver Nuggets star Michael Porter Jr., was charged Wednesday with felony counts of vehicular homicide and vehicular assault stemming from a suspected drunken-driving crash that killed a 42-year-old woman.

            Investigators say Porter, 21, smelled of alcohol and his speech was slurred when he was arrested following the early morning crash that killed Katharina Rothman on Jan. 22. A 47-year-old passenger in Rothman's vehicle was seriously injured.

            According to a probable cause statement, Porter ran a red light going about 50 mph (80 kmph) and hit Rothman's vehicle at an intersection near the university. When interviewed by police, Porter “displayed bloodshot and watery eyes, slurred and mumbling speech, and the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage on his breath,” the statement said. He also was wearing a “BudLight” paper wristband.











            Family members told KMGH-TV that Rothman, the mother of a 4-year-old boy, was driving for Uber at the time of the crash.

            The formal charges against Porter include vehicular homicide–DUI, vehicular homicide–reckless driving, vehicular assault–DUI and vehicular assault–reckless driving. Court records do not indicate if he has hired an attorney who can speak on his behalf.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797661,Joao Cancelo debut proves Julian Nagelsmann’s point,"He may have been a surprise late arrival, but Joao Cancelo was no panic signing. And it took him just 17 minutes of his debut to prove it, as Bayern Munich eased in to the quarterfinals on the German Cup on Wednesday.Bayern head coach Julian Nagelsmann has long had the Portuguese wingback right at the top of his dream shopping list. But even a man as tactically-minded as Nagelsmann wouldn't have imagined his pre-match assessment of his new loanee would be proved right so quickly.""He's a full-back who's very strong going forward, who slightly prefers playing on the right,"" Nagelsmann said, before announcing a team with a back three and Cancelo at right wingback. ""He also has the ability to go inside and then hits very good crosses to the far post.""Cancelo had read the script. After a couple of smart, penetrating forays inside, he stood up his man on the right and dug out one of those ""very good crosses to the far post."" Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting did the rest, steering in from a tight angle.It was a piece of play that Bayern's regular rightback, Benjamin Pavard, just isn't quite cut out for, the Frenchman more comfortable centrally, as he was on Wednesday.Cancelo's quality on the ball comes as no surprise. At Manchester City, he looked the archetypal Pep Guardiola fullback for several seasons. Solid enough defensively and comfortable enough to tuck in to midfield, take on his opponent or shoot from distance. There were echoes of how Guardiola used Phlipp Lahm at Bayern in Cancelo's time at City.But the falling out between Guardiola and Cancelo has offered Bayern a readymade solution to one of their more glaring problems. Teams often attack their right side, with Pavard's limitations, his alternate Noussair Mazraoui out injured, and Alphonso Davies a formidable opponent on the other side.While Cancelo's more eye-catching qualities come when he's going forward, he's a solid defender with a huge amount of top-level experience. Bayern will need that when the Champions League returns in two weeks' time. But, right now, they need players that can find a way to unlock deep defenses too. Three successive 1-1 draws since the Bundesliga returned from the World Cup have shown that.He won't be able to do it on his own, but an easing of the creative burden on Jamal Musiala and Joshua Kimmich also gives Bayern threats in different areas of the pitch: ""He just has a bit of a different profile to the other players we have,"" noted Nagelsmann.They used those different threats to great effect on Wednesday, with Musiala and Leroy Sanéadding goals in the sort of clinical first half display Bayern had yet to produce in 2023. Davies headed a fourth late on as the Bundesliga champions cruised through the second half.Bayern, and Cancelo, will doubtless face much greater challenges than a Mainz side who barely landed a punch. But progress in this competition has been fraught in recent years, with exits at the hands of Borussia Mönchengladbach and second tier Holstein Kiel in the last two years.Though it may never be the priority, Nagelsmann needs the German Cup. A league title is not always enough for Bayern, just ask Niko Kovac, and Champions League progress is a long way from guaranteed. So is the title right now, with the Bundesliga tight at the top. But early signs, and that assist, suggest Bayern are already a better team than they were last weekend.",2023/02/01,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797662,US opens embassy in Solomon Islands amid China threat,"The new US Embassy in the Solomon Islands is now up and running, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement, as Washington aims to put a check on China's growing influence in the Pacific.""The opening of the embassy builds on our efforts not only to place more diplomatic personnel throughout the region but also to engage further with our Pacific neighbors, connect United States programs and resources with needs on the ground, and build people-to-people ties,"" Blinken said.The embassy, which opened Thursday local time in the Solomons, will start out with a small staff. A charge d'affaires will manage the diplomatic outfit, which is based in the capital Honiara.The US previously had an embassy in the Solomons for a 5-year period from 1988 to 1993. The embassy was shut in the early 1990s as Washington sought to downsize its global diplomatic operations in the wake of the Cold War.Recent steps by China, however, have forced the US to refocus its diplomatic efforts on the Solomons, which has a population of around 700,000 people.In April, China said it signed a security accord with the Pacific Island nation, sparking concern in Washington. The US, along with partners Australia and New Zealand, believe the agreement will allow China to extend its military influence in the South Pacific.Solomon Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare signed onto the agreement after riots in November 2021.The unrest was triggered by the government's decision to switch allegiance from Taiwan to China, with buildings being burned to the ground and protesters attempting to breach the parliament. Corruption, poverty and other factors also exacerbated the anger of the demonstrators.Despite the China agreement, the Solomon Islands have pledged to continue cooperation with the US.In September, the island nation signed onto the US-Pacific Partnership, which aims to boost cooperation in areas such as security, climate and trade.wd/nm (AP, Reuters)",2023/02/01,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797663,EU holds talks with Ukraine in an active war zone,"It will be the biggest EU delegation Kyiv has welcomed since the beginning of Russia's invasion. 16 EU commissioners, including Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and the bloc's chief diplomat, Josef Borrell, as well as Council President Charles Michel, will take a train trip through the war-torn country. The commissioners will hold talks with Ukrainian government ministers in Kyiv on Thursday, followed by an EU-Ukraine summit in the Ukrainian capital on Friday.""It is obviously a very strong symbol,"" Marie Dumoulin, director of the Wider Europe program at the European Council on Foreign Relations and a former French diplomat, told DW. ""That's probably the way the EU institutions wanted it to be."" By holding the meetings in Kyiv, Dumoulin said, EU leaders demonstrate ""we are not afraid to come. We are ready to do this for you.""Dumoulin said she expects military and financial assistance to be on the meetings' agenda. The EU and its members have already delivered weapons and military equipment worth €11.5 billion ($12.5 billion) to Ukraine. The bloc is also slated to provide €18 billion in financial support in 2023, with a first tranche of €3 billion already disbursed. Money that is supposed to help the government in Kyiv keep paying wages and pensions and maintain essential public services running.""There are other discussions that will probably take place during the summit about the support for recovery and reconstruction,"" said Dumoulin. She pointed out that structures are already being put in place to coordinate donors and the overall reconstruction process. Beyond that, however, she expects only moderate progress from the summit in Kyiv in terms of tangible results.However, Rosa Balfour, director of the Carnegie Europe think tank, thinks the summit cannot be only symbolic. ""They need to have some tangibles,"" she said, emphasizing how far the bloc has already gone in supporting Ukraine and how Kyiv is continuously increasing pressure on Brussels to do more.""What used to be an ambiguous European policy towards Eastern Europe has now become a clear statement that Ukraine is a part of Europe and has a prospect of joining the bloc,"" Balfour said. Ukraine applied for EU membership days after Russia invaded on February 24 last year, and was granted candidate status in June 2022.Balfour emphasized how ""very quickly and thoroughly"" authorities in Kyiv went through the process of being recognized as a candidate country. ""The Ukrainian government really is, as the Americans say, walking and chewing gum at the same time. It's conducting a war, but it also has a plan for legislative reforms that are necessary in order to join the European Union,"" she said.The summit is meant to acknowledge these efforts and to encourage Ukraine to continue with reforms, so that one day they fulfill conditions required for EU membership, two EU officials told DW. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's 10-point peace plan is expected to be discussed in Kyiv, as well as the idea to create a special tribunal to hold Russia's leadership accountable for its war of aggression.However, speaking with DW, the EU officials also emphasized that the Ukrainian government might need to manage their expectations regarding the speed of the accession process.Balfour said the message will have to be that there is full support from the Europeans for Ukraine, but that this process will take time. She cited a recent interview with Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal, in which he spoke of an ambitious plan to join the EU within the next two years. ""There won't be a fast-track accession for Ukraine,"" Balfour said, ""but it's important to offer Ukraine incentives to continue with its reforms and to address current problems.""Balfour described corruption as one of the major problems that is at the top of the agenda of European policy makers, especially when it comes to mobilizing massive financial resources that will soon be needed for the reconstruction of the country. The European Commission has highlighted what it sees as ""the reform momentum"" in Ukraine, but some member states seem to question whether considerable progress has really been made.However, Balfour said she did not expect the recent corruption scandal that led to the resignations and sackings of several government officials to overshadow the summit. Both sides, Ukraine and the EU, Balfour pointed out, ""need to keep public opinion supportive of the support for Ukraine. We don't necessarily want to talk publicly about the underlying problems such as corruption because there is a question of morale. Morale that needs to be kept up for the Ukrainians, but also for the Europeans.""Balfour referred to some areas where announcements might be made, regarding further lowering customs duties, for instance, or bringing Ukraine into the EU free roaming zone for mobile phones.""These are hardly big prizes, but I think there will be movement. Both sides want to come out with a positive message for their domestic audiences and for each other."" Even if Kyiv will not get a fast track towards joining the European Union, Balfour said, the government will have something to show for to the Ukrainians.Edited by: Rob Mudge",2023/02/01,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797666,Man pleads guilty in death of long-missing Michigan woman,"BATTLE CREEK, Mich. (AP) — A man who previously admitted killing two women in Pennsylvania pleaded guilty Wednesday to killing a Michigan woman who disappeared more than 17 years ago.

            Harold David Haulman III pleaded guilty in Calhoun County District Court to second-degree murder in the death of 21-year-old Ashley Marie Parlier, Prosecutor David Gilbert said.

            Parlier went missing from her Battle Creek, Michigan, home on June 12, 2005, after her family, who believes she was pregnant, said she had an argument with her parents. 











            Haulman, 44, was charged in Parlier's killing in 2021. Her remains have not been found, but as part of his plea agreement, Haulman has agreed to help investigators find her body, WOOD-TV reported.

            “We obviously want closure for her remains,” said Parlier's sister, Nicole Campen. “But I try not to put my hopes in that with him because, to me, it’s more of a power thing for him. It’s one more thing he gets to have over us as a family.”

            Haulman is scheduled to be sentenced April 10.

            In September 2021, Haulman was sentenced to life in prison without parole after pleading guilty in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania to the killings of two women, The Daily Item reported at that time.

            Haulman admitted to killing Tianna Phillips, 25, of McClure, Pennsylvania, who had vanished in 2018, and Erica Shultz, 26, of Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania, who went missing in late 2020.

            As police were interviewing Haulman about those killings, he admitted to killing Parlier as well, telling authorities her body might be in a remote area in Newton Township, south of Battle Creek. An unsuccessful search for Parlier was conducted there in March 2021.BATTLE CREEK, Mich.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797667,Nebraska lawmakers put off vote on 'heartbeat' abortion ban,"LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) — The Nebraska Legislature’s Health and Human Services Committee took nearly eight hours of testimony Wednesday before adjourning without a vote on whether to advance a bill that would outlaw abortion at a point before many women know they’re pregnant.

            Hundreds of people crowded the halls of the state Capitol for a committee hearing on a so-called heartbeat bill.

            The bill would ban abortions once cardiac activity can be detected in an embryo, which is generally around the sixth week of pregnancy.











            The committee took testimony from around 100 people before adjourning. A decision about whether to advance the bill will come at a later date. 

            “This bill is about one thing: protecting babies with beating hearts from elective abortion,” Republican Sen. Joni Albrecht of Thurston told the Legislature's Health and Human Services Committee to kick off testimony on her bill Wednesday, which brought scores of ban supporters and hundreds of opponents into the Capitol.

            Lawmakers opposed to the ban have already attempted to throw up roadblocks to thwart the measure. Several attended a protest in the rotunda just before Wednesday's hearing that drew around 300 people opposed to the ban, including medical professionals and clergy. 

            Democratic Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha, who has been an outspoken opponent of restricting abortion rights, urged the crowd to continue showing up for each phase of the bill.

            “We need constant, prolonged, righteous outrage. They need to feel your energy,” Hunt said, drawing a shout of, “We'll never stop!” from someone in the crowd, followed by a roaring chant of “No more bans!” 

            Hunt also led a push to move the bill out of the conservative-leaning HHS committee, where it is almost certain to be advanced, and into the more politically balanced Judiciary Committee. She and other lawmakers argued that because the proposal would criminalize most abortions, it should be heard by the Judiciary Committee. 

            But that effort failed in a vote on the legislative floor last week, with backers of the ban countering that the bill does not include criminal penalties for women who receive abortions or doctors who perform them. They said it would subject doctors who perform outlawed abortions to professional discipline, which could include losing their medical licenses.

            While the bill doesn't list criminal penalties, it would make doctors vulnerable to criminal charges under existing state law, several lawmakers said. The law makes it a felony to perform an abortion not allowed under state law.

            “I think a prosecutor and potentially a jury could find that if you've performed an abortion that's not in compliance with medical practice — enough so to lose your license — then you're also in violation of that criminal law ,” said Democratic Sen. John Cavanaugh, an attorney from Omaha. 

            He pointed to an open case in Norfolk in which prosecutors charged a 41-year-old woman with a felony for helping her 17-year-old daughter end her pregnancy at 24 weeks by supplying her with pills to induce an abortion.

            “They will look at the statute and find ways to prosecute,” Cavanaugh said.

            Among those warily watching the latest attempt to effectively ban abortion in the red state is Kacie Ware, 35, of Omaha, who detailed a day before the hearing how she sought an abortion after becoming pregnant at 16 by a man twice her age who had raped her repeatedly starting when she was 15.

            Ware would not have been able to get an abortion under the current proposed ban because she didn't discover she was pregnant until well after six weeks of gestation, she said.

            “I would have done almost anything to end that pregnancy,” Ware said, even endangering her life to do so. “I could have died. What I know is, an abortion ban won't end abortions. It's only going to end safe abortions.”

            The hearing Wednesday ended with a heated exchange between Albrecht, the bill's main sponsor, and Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha, who strongly opposes the ban.

            Cavanaugh grilled Albrecht on how medical providers, under threat of losing their medical licenses, would be able to prove any abortions they provide were for women who were raped or to save the woman's life. 

            Albrecht insisted the way Nebraska doctors handle abortions won't change under the bill, repeating several times, “It's going to be done however it's done today,"" even though women currently have 20 weeks to terminate a pregnancy and don't have to report rape or incest to get an abortion.

            At one point, the senators yelled over each other, with Cavanaugh asking, “You're okay with women dying if this bill is passed?” 

            “I'm not going to do this theater,” Albrecht shot back. “I'm not going to answer that.”

            If enacted, Nebraska would join several other states that have passed similar cardiac activity abortion bans, including Georgia, Iowa, Ohio, South Carolina and Tennessee. Nebraska, which in 2010 became the first state to ban abortions after the 20th week of pregnancy, recently has struggled to enact tighter abortion restrictions.

            Anti-abortion lawmakers last year sought to pass a so-called trigger bill that would have automatically banned nearly all abortions, even those resulting from rape and incest, as soon as the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, which had guaranteed the right to abortion nationwide for nearly five decades. The effort fell two votes short of the 33 needed to overcome a filibuster. 

            Democrats in Nebraska's officially nonpartisan, one-house legislature hold 17 of the body's 49 seats, which would again leave abortion ban backers short of a supermajority. But abortion rights proponents have acknowledged the alliance behind last year’s filibuster may no longer hold that the ban includes exceptions for rape and incest.LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) — The Nebraska Legislature’s Health and Human Services Committee took nearly eight hours of testimony Wednesday before adjourning without a vote on whether to advance a bill that would outlaw abortion at a point before many women know they’re pregnant.Hundreds of people crowded the halls of the state Capitol for a committee hearing on a so-called heartbeat bill.The bill would ban abortions once cardiac activity can be detected in an embryo, which is generally around the sixth week of pregnancy.The committee took testimony from around 100 people before adjourning. A decision about whether to advance the bill will come at a later date.“This bill is about one thing: protecting babies with beating hearts from elective abortion,” Republican Sen. Joni Albrecht of Thurston told the Legislature's Health and Human Services Committee to kick off testimony on her bill Wednesday, which brought scores of ban supporters and hundreds of opponents into the Capitol.Lawmakers opposed to the ban have already attempted to throw up roadblocks to thwart the measure. Several attended a protest in the rotunda just before Wednesday's hearing that drew around 300 people opposed to the ban, including medical professionals and clergy.Democratic Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha, who has been an outspoken opponent of restricting abortion rights, urged the crowd to continue showing up for each phase of the bill.“We need constant, prolonged, righteous outrage. They need to feel your energy,” Hunt said, drawing a shout of, “We'll never stop!” from someone in the crowd, followed by a roaring chant of “No more bans!”Hunt also led a push to move the bill out of the conservative-leaning HHS committee, where it is almost certain to be advanced, and into the more politically balanced Judiciary Committee. She and other lawmakers argued that because the proposal would criminalize most abortions, it should be heard by the Judiciary Committee.But that effort failed in a vote on the legislative floor last week, with backers of the ban countering that the bill does not include criminal penalties for women who receive abortions or doctors who perform them. They said it would subject doctors who perform outlawed abortions to professional discipline, which could include losing their medical licenses.While the bill doesn't list criminal penalties, it would make doctors vulnerable to criminal charges under existing state law, several lawmakers said. The law makes it a felony to perform an abortion not allowed under state law.“I think a prosecutor and potentially a jury could find that if you've performed an abortion that's not in compliance with medical practice — enough so to lose your license — then you're also in violation of that criminal law ,” said Democratic Sen. John Cavanaugh, an attorney from Omaha.He pointed to an open case in Norfolk in which prosecutors charged a 41-year-old woman with a felony for helping her 17-year-old daughter end her pregnancy at 24 weeks by supplying her with pills to induce an abortion.“They will look at the statute and find ways to prosecute,” Cavanaugh said.Among those warily watching the latest attempt to effectively ban abortion in the red state is Kacie Ware, 35, of Omaha, who detailed a day before the hearing how she sought an abortion after becoming pregnant at 16 by a man twice her age who had raped her repeatedly starting when she was 15.Ware would not have been able to get an abortion under the current proposed ban because she didn't discover she was pregnant until well after six weeks of gestation, she said.“I would have done almost anything to end that pregnancy,” Ware said, even endangering her life to do so. “I could have died. What I know is, an abortion ban won't end abortions. It's only going to end safe abortions.”The hearing Wednesday ended with a heated exchange between Albrecht, the bill's main sponsor, and Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha, who strongly opposes the ban.Cavanaugh grilled Albrecht on how medical providers, under threat of losing their medical licenses, would be able to prove any abortions they provide were for women who were raped or to save the woman's life.Albrecht insisted the way Nebraska doctors handle abortions won't change under the bill, repeating several times, “It's going to be done however it's done today,"" even though women currently have 20 weeks to terminate a pregnancy and don't have to report rape or incest to get an abortion.At one point, the senators yelled over each other, with Cavanaugh asking, “You're okay with women dying if this bill is passed?”“I'm not going to do this theater,” Albrecht shot back. “I'm not going to answer that.”If enacted, Nebraska would join several other states that have passed similar cardiac activity abortion bans, including Georgia, Iowa, Ohio, South Carolina and Tennessee.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797668,US expresses concern over Sudan freeing diplomat's killer,"CAIRO (AP) — The U.S. said Wednesday it is “deeply concerned"" by Sudan's release of a man convicted in the 2008 killing of a U.S. diplomat and embassy employee in a drive-by shooting in the Sudanese capital, Khartoum. 

            State Department spokesman Ned Price said in a statement that Abdel-Raouf Abu Zaid, the Sudanese man who was found guilty of the murders, remains a “specially designated global terrorist.” 

            He was convicted of murdering John Granville, an official with the U.S. Agency for International Development, and his Sudanese driver, Abdel Rahman Abbas. They were shot while returing ome early in the morning on Jan. 1, 2008, from a New Year's Eve party.











            Price said any insinuation that the release was agreed by the United States as part of a settlement between the U.S. and Sudan was false. 

            In 2020, Sudan agreed to pay $335 million to settle compensation lawsuits at U.S. courts related to the 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, the 2000 attack of the USS Cole at Yemen’s southern port of Aden that killed 17 sailors and Granville’s killing.

            The settlement was made by Sudan’s former transitional government with the Trump administration to stop any future compensation claims being filed against the African country in U.S. courts.

            Abu Zaid was captured weeks after the shooting. He was convicted and sentenced to death for murder. Three other men also were sentenced to death in the case, while a fifth received a two-year sentence for providing the weapons used in the attack.

            The four awaiting hanging broke out of prison in June 2010, killing a Sudanese police officer and wounding another in a shootout in Khartoum’s twin city of Omdurman, according to a Sudanese notice to the international police agency, Interpol.

            Abu Zaid was re-arrested weeks later and returned to Kubar Prison. The three other men remained at large. 

            “We are deeply troubled by the lack of transparency in the legal process that resulted in the release of the only individual remaining in custody,” the State Department statement said, adding, that the U.S. “will continue to seek clarity about this decision.”

            Earlier this month, Abu Zaid’s family apologized for the killing of Granville and his driver, saying in a video message: “We, as a family, apologize and acknowledged Abdel-Raouf’s mistake, and he already admitted his mistake and expressed his regret and remorse for what has happened.”

            Granville, 33, was working to implement a 2005 peace agreement between Sudan’s north and south that ended more than two decades of civil war. A vehicle intercepted his car and gunmen inside opened fire, killing Granville and the driver, who also was a USAID employee.CAIRO (AP) — The U.S. said Wednesday it is “deeply concerned"" by Sudan's release of a man convicted in the 2008 killing of a U.S. diplomat and embassy employee in a drive-by shooting in the Sudanese capital, Khartoum.State Department spokesman Ned Price said in a statement that Abdel-Raouf Abu Zaid, the Sudanese man who was found guilty of the murders, remains a “specially designated global terrorist.”He was convicted of murdering John Granville, an official with the U.S. Agency for International Development, and his Sudanese driver, Abdel Rahman Abbas.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797669,"California has huge snowpack, but dry trend raises worries","LOS ANGELES (AP) — The mountain snowpack that supplies a significant amount of California's water got an incredible boost from recent powerful storms and is outpacing the state's wettest season on record, state water officials said Wednesday.

            But its too soon to know if the winter will be a drought-buster, they said. 

            Water content in the state's mountain snow is 205% of normal to date and 128% of the April 1 average, when the snow is at its historical peak, according to measurements taken by the California Department of Water Resources. Historically one-third of California's water supply has come from melting snow.











            “Our snowpack is off to an incredible start, and it’s exactly what California needs to really help break from our ongoing drought,” said Sean de Guzman, manager of the department's snow surveys and water supply forecasting unit.

            “However, for every day that it doesn’t rain or snow, we gradually return to drier conditions,” he said. 

            De Guzman conducted a manual measurement high in the Sierra Nevada at Phillips Station, south of Lake Tahoe, a location that demonstrates California's varying snow fortunes — sometimes buried in white and sometimes bare ground.

            His survey there found a snow depth of 85.5 inches (217.17 centimeters) and a water content that was 193% percent of the Feb. 1 average at the location. 

            The massive snowpack was largely left by nine atmospheric rivers that lasted from late December through mid-January. The storms dumped 32 trillion gallons of rain and snow on the state, allowing state water managers to boost water supplies for farms and cities.

            Most of California remains in moderate to severe drought, though that's better than several months ago when a huge swath of the state was in extreme or exceptional drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.

            The amount of water in the snowpack, technically described as snow water equivalent, currently outpaces California's record 1982-83 season, according to the department. But the weather has turned drier, with only modest systems passing through.

            DWR Director Karla Nemeth pointed out that February “is a traditional wet month that is actually starting off pretty dry” and the forecast is for dryness to continue.

            “Does our big January actually bust the drought in California? It’s too soon to tell,” Nemeth said. 

            Nemeth also suggested that the April 1 date is no longer reliable because climate change is changing the timing of the peak snowpack. She also cited recent years in which runoff has dropped off dramatically and storm conditions have shut down and been followed by excessive dry periods.

            “I don’t want to be the downer here,” Nemeth said. “But I do want to make sure that everyone understands that we need to exercise caution.” 

            The precipitation has filled some reservoirs but others remain below historic average storage to date. Among the state's largest reservoirs, Lake Oroville was at 65% of capacity and 112% of average as of midnight Tuesday. But Shasta Lake was lagging at 56% of capacity, 87% of its historic average to date.

            The storms also caused damaging flooding and landslides. There were at least 20 storm-related deaths, and a boy remains missing since being swept away by a swollen creek in San Luis Obispo County.LOS ANGELES (AP) — The mountain snowpack that supplies a significant amount of California's water got an incredible boost from recent powerful storms and is outpacing the state's wettest season on record, state water officials said Wednesday.But its too soon to know if the winter will be a drought-buster, they said.Water content in the state's mountain snow is 205% of normal to date and 128% of the April 1 average, when the snow is at its historical peak, according to measurements taken by the California Department of Water Resources.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797672,Star power at Pebble comes more from amateurs than pros,"PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. (AP) — U.S. Open champion Matt Fitzpatrick is one of only three players from the top 20 in the world at the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am. It's lacking star power by PGA Tour standards.

            That's not what Fitzpatrick saw.

            He played nine holes of practice Wednesday at Pebble Beach with retired Welsh soccer star Gareth Bale. And when he scanned the pairings for the three-course rotation, he realized actor and producer Jason Bateman would be in the group behind him.











            Fitzpatrick wants to meet him in hopes of getting on Bateman's podcast, prompting the question of whether Bateman knows the U.S. Open champion.

            “Oh, I doubt it. I severely doubt it,” Fitzpatrick said.

            Back to Bale, who retired after the World Cup and loves golf so much that Jon Rahm was raving about his game during the pro-am at Torrey Pines.

            Fitzpatrick and Bale first got to know each other a few years ago when Bale's management team was recruiting Fitzpatrick's younger brother.

            “I ended up having a conversation with him and his manager and he jokingly said to me, ‘If you sign for my management company, I’ll not score three goals against your team,' my team being Sheffield United,” Fitzpatrick said. “Obviously, I didn't sign. I'm happy with where I'm at.”

            Bale, on loan to Tottenham at the time, scored three goals against Sheffield.

            “I just remember watching the game and he scored all three and I was laughing,” Fitzpatrick said. “Obviously disappointed, as well.”

            Such is the nature of this tournament, held amid the incomparable scenery of the Monterey Peninsula between the NFL's conference championship games and the Super Bowl, a thing of beauty to see for those coping with the worst of winter.

            Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen opted out of the Pro Bowl and is playing for the second straight year, hopeful of making the cut this time. His caddie for the week is one of his best friends, Kyle Allen, who started two games at quarterback late in the season for the Houston Texans.

            It's easier to predict Aaron Rodgers being at Pebble Beach in early February than whether he'll be at training camp in July.

            That part of the tournament — athletes, actors, singers, corporate figures who shape the economy — doesn't change. It's the PGA Tour players who seem to be in short supply this year, perhaps due to a pair of $20 million events at Phoenix and Riviera to follow.

            And perhaps that's where Pebble Beach is headed.

            Jordan Spieth has never missed Pebble Beach, playing it for the first time in 2013 before he had a PGA Tour card and a corporate relationship with AT&T.

            “I would fight for an opportunity for this to be an elevated event in future years,” Spieth said. “I'm not sure if the format would have to change or what would have to happen. I really think the opportunity to get the top 50, 60, 70 players in the world playing Pebble Beach and that being a PGA Tour event would be as successful as when the U.S. Open’s held here. I think that trying to go to the world’s best courses, when you have the opportunity, would be advantageous.”

            What gives Pebble such a rich heritage — the amateurs — could be the sticking point. The only time amateurs were not part of the Pebble Beach Pro-Am was in 2021 amid tight restrictions because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Everything was different that year.

            There have been ruminations about Pebble once every so often having no amateurs and playing all four days at Pebble Beach — instead of including Spyglass Hill and the Shore course at Monterey Peninsula. That might feel like a U.S. Open in February.

            Could it form a rotation with Phoenix and Torrey Pines? Is there a way to make it an elevated event and keep the amateurs involved?

            This is part of the puzzle the PGA Tour is trying to figure out for 2024 and beyond. 

            Regardless of who plays, Pebble rarely lacks for memories, whether it's pure golf (Tiger Woods coming from seven shots behind with seven to play), pure entertainment (Bill Murray's antics) or pure danger.

            The latter would be Spieth last year on the eighth hole, when his tee shot ran through the fairway on the cusp of a cliff with a 60-foot drop to the rocks and ocean below.

            Keeping his balance, and against his caddie's advice, Spieth hit 7-iron and made par.

            “I think I saved a stroke,” he said. “Does the reward outweigh the risk? Not if you think the risk was dying. ... I think now, knowing my (14-month-old) son a lot better — he was really young at the time — I may not have hit that shot.”

            That might not be an option this year, anyway. While attention is on work to the eighth green that softened some ridges, the edge of the cliff now has rough thick enough to keep balls from rolling too far to the edge.

            “Yeah, it's not advised,” Spieth said. “I'm glad I ended up making a 4. Because if I made a 5 it would have been one of the worse decisions I ever made. Instead it was just a bad decision.”

            At least he lived to tell about it.

            AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsPEBBLE BEACH, Calif. (AP) — U.S. Open champion Matt Fitzpatrick is one of only three players from the top 20 in the world at the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am. It's lacking star power by PGA Tour standards.That's not what Fitzpatrick saw.He played nine holes of practice Wednesday at Pebble Beach with retired Welsh soccer star Gareth Bale. And when he scanned the pairings for the three-course rotation, he realized actor and producer Jason Bateman would be in the group behind him.Fitzpatrick wants to meet him in hopes of getting on Bateman's podcast, prompting the question of whether Bateman knows the U.S. Open champion.“Oh, I doubt it. I severely doubt it,” Fitzpatrick said.Back to Bale, who retired after the World Cup and loves golf so much that Jon Rahm was raving about his game during the pro-am at Torrey Pines.Fitzpatrick and Bale first got to know each other a few years ago when Bale's management team was recruiting Fitzpatrick's younger brother.“I ended up having a conversation with him and his manager and he jokingly said to me, ‘If you sign for my management company, I’ll not score three goals against your team,' my team being Sheffield United,” Fitzpatrick said. “Obviously, I didn't sign. I'm happy with where I'm at.”Bale, on loan to Tottenham at the time, scored three goals against Sheffield.“I just remember watching the game and he scored all three and I was laughing,” Fitzpatrick said. “Obviously disappointed, as well.”Such is the nature of this tournament, held amid the incomparable scenery of the Monterey Peninsula between the NFL's conference championship games and the Super Bowl, a thing of beauty to see for those coping with the worst of winter.Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen opted out of the Pro Bowl and is playing for the second straight year, hopeful of making the cut this time. His caddie for the week is one of his best friends, Kyle Allen, who started two games at quarterback late in the season for the Houston Texans.It's easier to predict Aaron Rodgers being at Pebble Beach in early February than whether he'll be at training camp in July.That part of the tournament — athletes, actors, singers, corporate figures who shape the economy — doesn't change. It's the PGA Tour players who seem to be in short supply this year, perhaps due to a pair of $20 million events at Phoenix and Riviera to follow.And perhaps that's where Pebble Beach is headed.Jordan Spieth has never missed Pebble Beach, playing it for the first time in 2013 before he had a PGA Tour card and a corporate relationship with AT&T.“I would fight for an opportunity for this to be an elevated event in future years,” Spieth said. “I'm not sure if the format would have to change or what would have to happen. I really think the opportunity to get the top 50, 60, 70 players in the world playing Pebble Beach and that being a PGA Tour event would be as successful as when the U.S. Open’s held here. I think that trying to go to the world’s best courses, when you have the opportunity, would be advantageous.”What gives Pebble such a rich heritage — the amateurs — could be the sticking point.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797673,"Lewandowski scores, Barça beats Betis to reach 50-point mark","MADRID (AP) — With another goal by Robert Lewandowski and yet another victory, Barcelona reached the 50-point mark and continued to show its strength going into the second half of the Spanish league.

            Lewandowski ended his scoring drought in the league to help Barcelona defeat Real Betis 2-1 and increase its lead over Real Madrid on Wednesday.

            Lewandowski sealed Barcelona's sixth straight victory in all competitions with his first league goal since October. He is the league's leading scorer with 14 goals. The Poland striker was making his return from a three-game suspension for disrespecting a referee in a match last year.











            Raphinha opened the scoring for Barcelona, which now is eight points in front of second-place Madrid ahead of the rival's home match against Valencia on Thursday.

            “We played a great match,” Barcelona coach Xavi said. “We are satisfied with the result and with how we played. We played well against a good team in a tough stadium.”

            Barcelona won the league four times after reaching 50 points or more through 19 rounds. It only failed to lift the trophy in that situation in 2013-14.

            “We are going through a good moment,” Raphinha said. “The points are a result of our effort. We remain confident for the rest of the season.”

            Both midweek games involving Barcelona and Madrid were postponed from January because of the teams’ participation in the Spanish Super Cup in Saudi Arabia. Barcelona defeated Betis in a penalty shootout in the semifinals before eventually winning the final against Madrid. Madrid played Valencia in the other semifinal, also advancing in a shootout.

            It was Betis' sixth straight league loss at home against Barcelona, which has won eight straight if counting the shootout win over Betis in the Super Cup.

            Betis stayed in sixth place in the league, 19 points behind Barcelona. It is three points behind fourth-place Atletico Madrid in the final Champions League place. Manuel Pellegrini's team has won one of its last five games in all competitions.

            Raphinha put Barcelona ahead with a touch from close range after a left-flank low cross by Alejandro Balde in the 65th minute. Lewandowski added to the lead with a shot from inside the area in the 80th, and Betis got on the board with an own-goal by Barcelona defender Jules Koundé in the 85th.

            Lewandowski has five goals in his last five matches in all tournaments.

            The win came after Barcelona closed the winter transfer window without any signings to boost its squad. It saw forward Memphis Depay move to Atletico and Héctor Bellerín join Sporting Lisbon. Veteran defender Gerard Piqué retired.

            Betis lost defender Álex Moreno to Arsenal and forward Loren Morón to Las Palmas, but it signed former Leicester forward Ayoze Pérez.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797678,IndyCar's Conor Daly open to last-minute Daytona 500 ride,"IndyCar driver Conor Daly would accept a last-minute Daytona 500 ride if offered the chance to enter “The Great American Race.”

            Helio Castroneves last week ruled out trying to make NASCAR's season-opening race because the four-time Indianapolis 500 winner did not believe there was enough time to prepare for the Feb. 19 event. Castroneves, after a ride failed to materialize with Trackhouse Racing, entered discussions with the team owned by Floyd Mayweather.

            Daly, meanwhile, made his NASCAR Cup Series debut last October driving for Mayweather's team. Daly indicated Wednesday that talks with The Money Team Racing about the Daytona 500 opened after Castroneves pulled out.











            “Who knows what will happen in the next couple days or weeks, I guess,” he said. ""If that opportunity were to come up, I chatted with a young man by the name of Helio Castroneves earlier, and I think for him an opportunity like that could probably come about really anytime. 

            “But for me, I don’t know if an opportunity like that would come again. If there is a chance, I feel like I can’t not do it, or not try to do it at least.”

            TMT last year made the Daytona 500 with driver Kaz Grala in the first NASCAR race for Mayweather’s team. Grala finished 26th. 

            Daly's only NASCAR experience on an oval was in the Truck Series. His Cup race in the No. 50 was on The Roval at Charlotte Motor Speedway, a hybrid road course that uses a portion of the oval. He finished 34th.

            “Really cool to get to do that and be a part of the NASCAR Cup Series and hopefully obviously shine some light on the IndyCar Series, as well,” Daly said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797679,Megan Rapinoe back with US for SheBelieves Cup,"Megan Rapinoe is set to return for the United States in the SheBelieves Cup after missing the team's recent trip to New Zealand because of an ankle injury. 

            Rapinoe has made 197 appearances for the United States and she could reach 200 during the tournament, which begins Feb. 16 in Orlando, Florida. 

            Thirteen U.S. women have reached the 200-game milestone. Alex Morgan was the most recent, making her 200th appearance in a match against Germany in November. She will be honored before the team's SheBelieves opener against Canada. 











            Japan plays Brazil to open the round-robin tournament at Exploria Stadium, followed by the U.S. game against rival Canada. The tournament moves to Nashville on Feb. 19, with the Americans facing Japan followed by Brazil against Canada. 

            The final matches will be in Frisco, Texas. Canada plays Japan before the United States meets Brazil. The winner is determined by points.

            Rapinoe and Morgan were among the 23 players on the U.S. roster announced Wednesday for the annual tournament. Defender Tierna Davidson, who is coming back to the team after an ACL injury, will join training but not play in the matches. 

            Coach Vlatko Andonovski continues to tweak his roster and look at different combinations as the United States prepares for this summer's Women's World Cup in Australia and New Zealand. 

            Sophia Smith, the U.S. Soccer Player of the Year, is still recovering from a foot injury and was not included on the roster. Catarina Macario is rehabbing from an ACL injury but is expected to join her club team in Lyon later this month. Smith and Macario were also absent from the team's training camp in New Zealand last month. 

            “It will show us where the team is now, but I don’t think it will be a real parameter of where the team is gonna be 5 1/2 months from now. Because I know we’re going to try different things, and test different combinations of players. I’m sure that the same thing will happen with the teams that we’re going to face,” Andonovski said about the latest roster. “So I don’t think it will show the exact level of where the teams are at.""

            Midfielder Sam Mewis announced Tuesday that she required a second surgery on her right knee and will likely miss the World Cup. Andonovski also suggested that Julie Ertz, who gave birth to a son in August, would not be ready for the tournament this summer.

            The United State roster by position, including club affiliation: 

            Goalkeepers: Adrianna Franch (Kansas City Current), Casey Murphy (North Carolina Courage), Alyssa Naeher (Chicago Red Stars). 

            Defenders: Alana Cook (OL Reign), Emily Fox (North Carolina Courage), Crystal Dunn (Portland Thorns), Naomi Girma (San Diego Wave), Sofia Huerta (OL Reign), Becky Sauerbrunn (Portland Thorns), Emily Sonnett (OL Reign).

            Midfielders: Lindsey Horan (Olympique Lyon), Taylor Kornieck (San Diego Wave), Rose Lavelle (OL Reign), Kristie Mewis (NJ/NY Gotham), Ashley Sanchez (Washington Spirit), Andi Sullivan (Washington Spirit. )

            Forwards: Ashley Hatch (Washington Spirit), Alex Morgan (San Diego Wave), Midge Purce (NJ/NY Gotham), Megan Rapinoe (OL Reign), Trinity Rodman (Washington Spirit), Mallory Swanson (Chicago Red Stars), Lynn Williams (NJ/NY Gotham FC).

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797680,"Biden goes after fees levied for flights, hotels and tickets","President Joe Biden took swipes at airlines and hotels Wednesday as he called on Congress to limit certain extra charges they impose on consumers.

            “These unfair fees add up,” he said, speaking just before a meeting of the White House Competition Committee. 

            Biden said Congress should restrict airline seat-assignment fees imposed on families trying to sit together, so-called resort fees that many hotels now tack on to the bill, excessive service charges on tickets for concerts and sporting events, and fees to switch or cancel internet, cable or cellphone service.











            “Some airlines charge extra to pick your seat, including for parents who just want to sit next to their child on a plane,” Biden said. “They charge extra — you don't know that going in though — and it's wrong.”

            A spokeswoman for Airlines for America, a trade group that represents the largest U.S. carriers, said its members — including American, United, Delta and Southwest — don't charge family-seating fees, although some budget airlines do. 

            The larger airlines “make every effort to accommodate customers traveling together, especially those traveling with children, without additional charges, and consumers are offered a range of choices at the time of ticket purchase, including various seating options,” said the spokeswoman, Marli Collier.

            Congress previously told the Transportation Department to review airline seating policies and consider how to ensure that children under 14 sit with an older family member at no extra cost. The department issued guidance last July urging airlines to do so “to the maximum extent practicable.”

            Biden also took aim at hotels for adding resort fees, “which can be over $50 a night, when you check out.”

            A spokesman for the American Hotel and Lodging Association said 94% of hotels don’t charge resort fees. For those that do, “it covers unique and tangible amenities such as food and beverage credits, special events, access to pools and beaches, transportation and spa services,” said the spokesman, Curt Cashour.

            On ticket fees, Democrats and Republicans on a Senate committee called last week for more transparency after Ticketmaster scrapped a general-public sale for Taylor Swift concerts.

            Separately, Biden touted a proposed new regulation from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that he said would limit credit-card late fees from $31 on average to $8. 

            The White House contends that legislation approved during the Obama administration lets the bureau regulate excessive credit card fees, while Biden's other proposals would need congressional approval, which could be difficult because of opposition from business interests.President Joe Biden took swipes at airlines and hotels Wednesday as he called on Congress to limit certain extra charges they impose on consumers.“These unfair fees add up,” he said, speaking just before a meeting of the White House Competition Committee.Biden said Congress should restrict airline seat-assignment fees imposed on families trying to sit together, so-called resort fees that many hotels now tack on to the bill, excessive service charges on tickets for concerts and sporting events, and fees to switch or cancel internet, cable or cellphone service.“Some airlines charge extra to pick your seat, including for parents who just want to sit next to their child on a plane,” Biden said. “They charge extra — you don't know that going in though — and it's wrong.”A spokeswoman for Airlines for America, a trade group that represents the largest U.S. carriers, said its members — including American, United, Delta and Southwest — don't charge family-seating fees, although some budget airlines do.The larger airlines “make every effort to accommodate customers traveling together, especially those traveling with children, without additional charges, and consumers are offered a range of choices at the time of ticket purchase, including various seating options,” said the spokeswoman, Marli Collier.Congress previously told the Transportation Department to review airline seating policies and consider how to ensure that children under 14 sit with an older family member at no extra cost.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797681,"Column: Brady's finale didn't go as planned, but not too bad","In a perfect world — and so much of Tom Brady's career was as close to perfection as a football player can get — the first retirement would've stuck.

            He certainly did nothing to enhance his legacy by returning for another season. And, of course, we’ll never know if that regrettable decision cost him his marriage, as well.

            But Brady's farewell year — he announced his retirement again on Wednesday, and this time insisted that he means it — will quickly fade from our collective memories, overwhelmed by the enormity of his accomplishments over an unprecedented career.











            The seven Super Bowl titles. The three MVP awards. The five Super Bowl MVP awards. The certain spot in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. The unquestioned legacy as the greatest quarterback ever to toss a pigskin.

            And Brady being Brady, even his final season with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers — the one he never should've come back for at age 45 — was hardly an embarrassment.

            Yes, he presided over a team with a losing record for the first time in his 23-year career. (Let that one sink in for a moment. One losing season in more than two decades as an NFL quarterback. Simply amazing.) 

            Yes, he did get embarrassed in the playoffs after the Bucs snuck in only because a geographical anomaly gifted them a division title they hardly deserved.

            But this wasn't Willie Mays or Joe Namath or Muhammad Ali at the end of their careers, pitiable shells of their former greatness.

            Tampa Bay was terrible on offense, but it was hardly Brady's fault. Playing behind a line that had more leaks than a rickety old garden hose, he broke his own, year-old NFL record for most completions in a season with 490, and eclipsed another league mark with 733 passes thrown. 

            Only five other times in his career did Brady throw for more yards than this season's 4,694. A 66.8% completion rate also was among the best he's ever put up.

            He wasn't at the top of the game anymore, but he wasn't that far off. NFL.com ranked him No. 11 among the league's 32 primary starting QBs at the end of the regular season, which seems an appropriate spot.

            Brady could've gone deep one time, looking to connect on a desperation pass that might've given him a shot at a more appropriate ending: an eighth Super Bowl ring. There were some teams that might've been interested, perhaps even the San Francisco 49ers.

            The team that reached the NFC championship game despite losing three quarterbacks to major injuries certainly has the talent everywhere else to make another run at the Super Bowl.

            A one-off with Brady might've slowed the development of Trey Lance and Brock Purdy, but it would've made the 49ers a clear Super Bowl favorite next season. For good measure, it would've given Brady a chance to close his career not far from where he grew up in the Bay Area.

            But we'll never know if such a scenario was ever realistic. With a 50-second video posted to social media on the one-year anniversary of his first retirement, Brady called it a career.

            This time, he insisted, it's gonna stick.

            “Good morning guys. I'll get to the point right away. I'm retiring,” he said, nodding his head slightly. “For good.”

            He chided himself a bit for the hoopla that surrounded his 2022 decision, which he reversed 40 days later. 

            “I know the process was a pretty big deal last time,” Brady said. “So when I woke up this morning, I figured I'd just press record and let you guys know first. I won't be long-winded. You only get one super-emotional retirement essay, and I used mine up last year.”

            The saddest part of Brady's final season was not the results on the field, but what happened away from the gridiron. 

            In late October, amid tabloid talk that Gisele Bündchen was livid at her husband for going back on his decision to retire, the couple finalized a divorce to their 13-year marriage.

            They seem on good terms now.

            Bündchen posted a comment to her ex-husband's video on Instagram that said, “Wishing you only wonderful things in this new chapter of your life."" She tacked on a praying hands emoji. He added pictures of Bündchen and their children to his post. 

            No need to fret for the G.O.A.T.

            Brady has already lined up an extremely lucrative landing for his post-playing career, agreeing last year to a staggering 10-year, $375 million contract to serve as a Fox game analyst.

            It will be intriguing to see if he can bring the same brilliance and insight to the broadcast booth, especially when he rarely said anything all that interesting as a player. 

            Not to mention, his arrival is sure to stir up a bit of drama since Fox's current lead analyst, Greg Olsen, has quickly gone from stopgap to one of the best of the business.

            But never bet against the guy who went from a sixth-round draft pick to the best there's ever been.

            “Thank you guys for allowing me to live my absolute dream,” Brady concluded in his retirement video, his voice quivering. “I wouldn't change a thing.”

            Not even a final season that didn't go as planned.

            As with all things Brady, it might be the best performance we'll ever see by a past-their-prime athlete who should've stayed retired.

            AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFLIn a perfect world — and so much of Tom Brady's career was as close to perfection as a football player can get — the first retirement would've stuck.He certainly did nothing to enhance his legacy by returning for another season. And, of course, we’ll never know if that regrettable decision cost him his marriage, as well.But Brady's farewell year — he announced his retirement again on Wednesday, and this time insisted that he means it — will quickly fade from our collective memories, overwhelmed by the enormity of his accomplishments over an unprecedented career.The seven Super Bowl titles. The three MVP awards. The five Super Bowl MVP awards. The certain spot in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. The unquestioned legacy as the greatest quarterback ever to toss a pigskin.And Brady being Brady, even his final season with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers — the one he never should've come back for at age 45 — was hardly an embarrassment.Yes, he presided over a team with a losing record for the first time in his 23-year career. (Let that one sink in for a moment. One losing season in more than two decades as an NFL quarterback. Simply amazing.)Yes, he did get embarrassed in the playoffs after the Bucs snuck in only because a geographical anomaly gifted them a division title they hardly deserved.But this wasn't Willie Mays or Joe Namath or Muhammad Ali at the end of their careers, pitiable shells of their former greatness.Tampa Bay was terrible on offense, but it was hardly Brady's fault. Playing behind a line that had more leaks than a rickety old garden hose, he broke his own, year-old NFL record for most completions in a season with 490, and eclipsed another league mark with 733 passes thrown.Only five other times in his career did Brady throw for more yards than this season's 4,694.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797682,First sweeping federal gun crime report in 20 years released,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The most expansive federal report in over two decades on guns and crime shows a shrinking turnaround between the time a gun was purchased and when it was recovered from a crime scene, indicating firearms bought legally are more quickly being used in crimes around the country. 

            It also documents a spike in the use of conversion devices that make a semiautomatic gun fire like a machine gun, along with the growing seizure of so-called ghost guns, privately made firearms that are hard to trace. 

            The report comes as the nation grapples with a rise in violent crime, particularly from guns.











            Much of the data from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives report hasn’t been widely available before, and its release is aimed at helping police and policy makers reduce gun violence, said Director Steve Dettelbach. “Information is power,” he said.

            The report shows 54% of guns that police recovered in crime scenes in 2021 had been purchased within three years, a double-digit increase since 2019. The quicker turnaround can indicate illegal gun trafficking or a straw purchase — when someone who can legally purchase a gun buys one to sell it to someone who can’t legally possess guns. The increase was driven largely by guns bought less than a year before, it said. 

            The number of new guns overall in the U.S. grew significantly during that time as gun sales shattered records during the coronavirus pandemic. 

            Most guns used in crimes changed hands since their purchase, the report states. It also found what Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco called an epidemic of stolen guns: more than 1.07 million firearms were reported stolen between 2017 and 2021. Almost all of those, 96%, were from private individuals. 

            Meanwhile, the report also documents a more than five-fold increase in the number of devices that convert a legal semi-automatic weapon into an illegal fully automatic one. Between 2012 and 2016, the ATF retrieved 814 of those, but that number jumped to 5,414 during the five-year period documented in the report. 

            A conversion device was used in a mass shooting that left six people dead and 12 wounded in Sacramento last April in what officers described as a shootout between rival gangs.

            The document also traces the rise of “ ghost guns,” privately made firearms without serial numbers that have increasingly been turning up at crime scenes around the nation. 

            The ATF traced more than 19,000 privately made firearms in 2021, more than double the year before. That jump is the result in part of the agency encouraging police to send it the weapons so they can be traced, even though they typically haven’t yielded as much information as typical firearms. The weapons do have unique ballistics and other characteristics that can be useful to investigators. 

            The report came after Attorney General Merrick Garland told the ATF to produce the first comprehensive study of criminal gun trafficking in more than 20 years.WASHINGTON (AP) — The most expansive federal report in over two decades on guns and crime shows a shrinking turnaround between the time a gun was purchased and when it was recovered from a crime scene, indicating firearms bought legally are more quickly being used in crimes around the country.It also documents a spike in the use of conversion devices that make a semiautomatic gun fire like a machine gun, along with the growing seizure of so-called ghost guns, privately made firearms that are hard to trace.The report comes as the nation grapples with a rise in violent crime, particularly from guns.Much of the data from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives report hasn’t been widely available before, and its release is aimed at helping police and policy makers reduce gun violence, said Director Steve Dettelbach. “Information is power,” he said.The report shows 54% of guns that police recovered in crime scenes in 2021 had been purchased within three years, a double-digit increase since 2019.

And the Fed signaled that even though inflation is easing, it remains high enough to require further rate hikes. At the same time, Chair Jerome Powell said at a news conference that the Fed recognizes that the pace of inflation has cooled — a signal that it could be nearing the end of its rate increases. The stock and bond markets rallied during his news conference, suggesting that they anticipate a forthcoming pause in the Fed’s credit tightening.

            NEW YORK (AP) — Wall Street rose to its best level since the summer following the latest hike to interest rates by the Federal Reserve, which said it’s finally seeing improvements in inflation. The S&P 500 rallied back from an early 1% loss Wednesday to rise 1%. As expected, the Fed raised its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point to its highest level since late 2007. It’s the smallest increase in the Fed’s blizzard of rate hikes since March. The Fed’s chair said more increases are likely needed, but he also said the disinflationary process has started.

Meta Platforms Inc. said Wednesday it earned $4.65 billion, or $1.76 per share, in the final three months of 2022. That’s down 55% from $10.29 billion, or $3.67 per share, a year earlier. According to a poll by FactSet, analysts were expecting earnings of $2.26 per share. Revenue fell 4% to $32.17 billion from $33.67 billion. Analysts were expecting $31.55 billion.

            LONDON (AP) — Europe’s inflation rate has dipped at the start of the year, giving some relief to consumers but still leaving them facing higher prices. The European Union statistics agency said Wednesday that the consumer price index for the 20 countries that use the euro currency reached 8.5% in January compared with a year earlier. That’s down from the annual rate of 9.2% in December. It’s the first report on consumer prices with data from Croatia, which joined the eurozone on Jan. 1. Inflation in Europe has now slowed for the third month in a row, falling from a record high of 10.6% in October. Food and energy prices are persisting as the major factors driving up inflation.

That was shortly before he tweeted he had the financing for an aborted buyout that still is still haunting him in a high-profile trial. The former aide, Sam Teller, detailed that Musk held with representatives from Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund during testimony in a trial triggered by a class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of Tesla shareholders alleging Musk misled them in August 2018 indicating a buyout of the electric automakers was in the works.

Thousands of schools closed some or all of their classrooms, train services are paralyzed and delays are expected at airports as teachers, university staff, civil servants, border officials and train and bus drivers join a mass walkout. Wednesday’s strikes mark an escalation of disruptive action across multiple key industries. Unions are stepping up pressure on the government to demand better pay. They argue that wages have stagnated for a decade and failed to keep pace with soaring inflation.

            WASHINGTON (AP) — There’s been a sharp increase in the number of hate-filled business reviews spotted by Yelp’s content moderators. The San Francisco-based company says it proactively removed more than 2,000 such posts last year, up from less than 250 the year before. While some of the content targeted Black, Latino and LGBTQ people, Asian American business owners experienced the worst increase, reflecting the lingering stigma of the COVID-19 pandemic. The increases are a function of Yelp’s improved efforts to remove racist content and show how even a site known for reviews of restaurants and repairmen can become ensnared in America’s ongoing battle over online civility.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797684,N. Korea warns of 'overwhelming nuclear force' to counter US,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea said Thursday it’s prepared to counter U.S. military moves with the “most overwhelming nuclear force” as it warned that the expansion of the United States’ military exercises with rival South Korea is pushing tensions to an “extreme red line.”

            The statement by Pyongyang’s Foreign Ministry came in response to comments by U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who said Tuesday in Seoul that the United States would increase its deployment of advanced military assets to the Korean Peninsula, including fighter jets and aircraft carriers, as it strengthens joint training and operational planning with South Korea. 

            South Korea’s security jitters have risen since North Korea test-fired dozens of missiles in 2022, including potentially nuclear-capable ones designed to strike targets in South Korea and the U.S. mainland. 











            In a statement attributed to an unidentified spokesperson of its Foreign Ministry, North Korea said the expansion of the allies’ drills is threatening to turn the Korean Peninsula into a “huge war arsenal and a more critical war zone.” The statement said the North is prepared to counter any short- or long-term military challenge with the “most overwhelming nuclear force.”

            “The military and political situation on the Korean Peninsula and in the region has reached an extreme red line due to the reckless military confrontational maneuvers and hostile acts of the U.S. and its vassal forces,” the spokesperson said. 

            North Korea for decades has described the United States’ combined military exercises with South Korea as rehearsals for a potential invasion, although the allies have described those drills as defensive. 

            South Korea’s Defense Ministry said the United States flew B-1B bombers and F-22 and F-35 fighter jets in an exercise Wednesday with South Korean fighters above South Korea’s western waters. The United States and South Korea are also planning to a joint simulation this month aimed at sharpening their response if North Korea uses nuclear weapons. 

            The North Korean statement portends another provocative run in weapons demonstrations in 2023, similar to how the North ramped up its own weapons launches in 2022 as the allies resumed their large-scale training. North Korea’s actions included a slew of missile and artillery launches that it described as simulated nuclear attacks on South Korean and U.S. targets.

            “DPRK will take the toughest reaction to any military attempt of the U.S. on the principle of ‘nuke for nuke and an all-out confrontation for an all-out confrontation!’” the North Korean spokesperson said, invoking the country’s formal name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.

            “If the U.S. continues to introduce strategic assets into the Korean Peninsula and its surrounding area, the DPRK will make clearer its deterring activities without fail according to their nature,” the spokesperson said.

            When asked about the North Korean statement in the Philippines on Thursday, Austin said the United States is “very serious” about its commitment to defending South Korea and will continue to work alongside its allies and “train and ensure that we maintain credible and ready forces.” 

            Ahn Eunju, spokesperson of South Korea’s Foreign Ministry, said North Korea’s expansion of its nuclear weapons and missile program and verbal threats of preemptive nuclear attacks have forced Seoul to react sternly to ensure the protection of its citizens. 

            “North Korea is the one that’s elevating tensions on the Korean Peninsula by rejecting dialogue offers from South Korea and the United States and making nuclear and missile provocations and threats,” she said, urging Pyongyang to return to denuclearization talks. 

            Jeon Ha Gyu, spokesperson of South Korea’s Defense Ministry, said the allies’ latest aerial drills were aimed at demonstrating the credibility of the U.S. “extended deterrence,” referring to a commitment to use the full range of its military capabilities, including nuclear ones, to defend South Korea. He declined to reveal the exact number of U.S. and South Korean aircraft involved in the exercise. 

            In a news conference following their meeting on Tuesday, Austin said he and South Korean Defense Minister Lee Jong-Sup agreed to further expand their combined military exercises, including more live-fire demonstrations. They pledged to continue a “timely and coordinated” deployment of U.S. strategic assets to the region. 

            The allies had previously downsized their training in recent years to create room for diplomacy with North Korea during the Trump administration and because of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

            South Korea and the United States have also been strengthening their security cooperation with Japan, which recently included trilateral missile defense and anti-submarine warfare exercises during a provocative run in North Korean weapons tests. 

            “We deployed fifth-generation aircraft, F-22s and F-35s, we deployed a carrier strike group to visit the peninsula. You can look for more of that kind of activity going forward,” Austin said. 

            Tensions could further rise with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un doubling down on his nuclear ambitions. 

            During a political conference in December, Kim called for an “exponential increase” in nuclear warheads, mass production of battlefield tactical nuclear weapons targeting South Korea, and the development of more powerful long-range missiles designed to reach the U.S. mainland.

            Kim could showcase his growing arsenal of nuclear-capable missiles next week as commercial satellite images indicate preparations for a huge military parade in capital Pyongyang, likely for the 75th founding anniversary of its army that falls on Feb. 8. 

            Experts say Kim’s nuclear push is aimed at forcing the United States to accept the idea of North Korea as a nuclear power so it can negotiate badly needed economic concessions from a position of strength. Nuclear negotiations between the U.S. and North Korea stopped in 2019 because of disagreements over a relaxation of U.S.-led economic sanctions against the North in exchange for steps by North Korea to wind down its nuclear weapons and missiles programs.

            The North Korean spokesperson said Pyongyang isn’t interested in any contact or dialogue with the United States as long as it maintains its “hostile policy and confrontational line,” saying Washington is trying to force Pyongyang to “disarm itself unilaterally.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797685,"Arkansas House passes school bathroom bill, heads to Senate","LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) — The Arkansas House on Wednesday approved legislation preventing transgender people at public schools from using bathrooms that match their gender identity, while a legislative panel endorsed a measure restricting drag performances in the state.

            The bills advanced through the majority-Republican Legislature two years after lawmakers approved restrictions on transgender youth, including a ban on gender-affirming care for minors that has been blocked by a federal judge. 

            Opponents of the bathroom bill said it's marginalizing transgender students who are already at high risk of bullying, and said it's a sign of misplaced priorities in the Legislature.











            “When I talk to my constituents, they worry about many things but I never hear anything about bathrooms,"" Democratic Rep. Tippi McCullough, the House minority leader and only openly gay member of the state Legislature, said before the vote.

            The legislation approved by the House on an 80-10 vote applies to multi-person restrooms and locker rooms at public schools and charter schools serving prekindergarten through 12th grades. Teachers, principals and superintendents who violate the measure could face fines from a state panel, and parents could file lawsuits to enforce the restriction.

            The bill now heads to the majority-Republican Senate. The Republican sponsor of the bill said she introduced it after being approached by members of the school board in the central Arkansas city of Conway, which enacted a similar policy last year.

            “Each child in our schools has a right to privacy and to feel safe and to feel comfortable in the bathroom they need to go to,"" Republican Rep. Mary Bentley said before the vote. 

            A wide-ranging bathroom bill was enacted in North Carolina in 2016 but rolled back a year later after it sparked boycotts and protests. Arkansas is one of several states where school bathroom bills have been proposed.

            Similar laws have been enacted in Alabama, Oklahoma and Tennessee. Lawsuits have been filed challenging the Oklahoma and Tennessee restrictions. Bentley has cited a federal appeals court ruling upholding a similar policy at a Florida school district last year. Two other appeals courts have upheld transgender students' rights to use the bathroom corresponding with the gender identity.

            The bathroom bill won initial approval hours after a House committee advanced legislation restricting drag performances. The measure, which now heads to the House for a vote, would make Arkansas the first state to restrict drag shows.

            Drag story hours — which feature drag queens reading books to children — and other events featuring drag performers have prompted protests by right-wing activists who see them as harmful to children.

            The bill originally classified drag performances as adult-oriented businesses, the same category used for strip clubs and adult theaters, and banned them from public property. The legislation was amended Wednesday to remove the reference to drag shows, but appears to place the same restrictions on them by creating a new category of “adult-oriented performances.""

            The new version of the bill defines adult-oriented performances as featuring someone nude or semi-nude and intended to appeal to “prurient"" interests, a term that's not defined in the legislation. It also defines such performances as featuring the “purposeful exposure"" of an anatomical area or prosthetic genitalia or breasts, or featuring a specific sexual activity.

            Opponents said the bill, as amended, could go well beyond restricting drag performances.

            “At its core, it’s really trying to target the LGBTQ population and regulate speech affecting all of us and overstepping into the rights of parents to raise their own children,"" Holly Dickson, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas. “The amendment didn’t fix any of those fatal problems.""LITTLE ROCK, Ark.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797686,Air Force opposes Chinese-owned corn plant for North Dakota,"The U.S. Air Force has told North Dakota leaders that it believes a Chinese company’s plans to build a wet corn milling plant near its Grand Forks base poses a “significant threat to national security,” prompting city officials to say they'll move to stop a project once touted as an economic boon.

            The Fufeng Group’s planned $700 million facility would be 12 miles (19 kilometers) from the Grand Forks Air Force Base, a location that triggered some local concern about potential espionage. Gov. Doug Burgum and U.S. Sens. John Hoeven and Kevin Cramer — all Republicans — pressed the federal government in July to expedite a review of any security risk.

            U.S.-China business ties have become strained amid growing tensions between the two countries over security and trade issues, which often overlap. China on Monday criticized U.S. controls on technology exports as a trade violation. Fears over spying have led the U.S. armed forces to prohibited the Chinese-owned app TikTok on military devices, and nearly half of state governments across the country have banned the video-sharing platform from state-owned devices. 











            The Grand Forks Air Force Base is a center for both air and space operations, according to a letter sent to Hoeven and Cramer by Andrew Hunter, an assistant secretary of the Air Force. The senators released the correspondence Tuesday. 

            “The proposed project presents a significant threat to national security with both near- and long-term risks of significant impacts to our operations in the area,” Hunter wrote. The letter didn't offer any evidence that Fufeng is a threat, nor did it detail what kind of risks the company's business might pose. 

            Still, it was enough to move local authorities to action.

            ""We believe the city should discontinue the Fufeng project and instead we should work together to find an American company to develop the agriculture project,” Hoeven and Cramer said in a joint statement. 

            Grand Forks Mayor Brandon Bochenski said in a statement that he will ask his City Council to deny building permits for the project and to refuse to connect the 370-acre (150-hectare) site in Grand Forks’ agri-business park to public infrastructure. The mayor, who previously favored the project, added that the federal government's response had been “slow and contradictory.”

            “It’s clearly a reflection of both the growing skepticism of trade ties with China and a sense of the security risks that come from Chinese investment,” said Adam Segal, director of the digital and cyberspace policy program at the Council on Foreign Relations.

            Without knowing more about specific risks the Air Force fears, it's not clear why the military considers Fufeng's proposed mill a greater threat than any other Chinese presence in the area, Segal said. The region is already home to a Chinese-owned Cirrus Aircraft plant.

            Fufeng officials previously have denied that the plant would be used for espionage. The company declined a request for comment Wednesday. The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.

            The Grand Forks City Council gave initial approval last February to the project, which officials said at the time could be the largest private sector investment in the community’s history. The governor initially supported it, too.

            But council meetings became increasingly heated over the summer amid growing public opposition and the increasingly strained U.S.-China relationship. 

            Given the “unambiguous” position of the Air Force, Burgum welcomed the city's decision to try to stop Fufeng from building the mill. He said in a statement that he would support the city's efforts to find another partner for a corn milling operation.

            Privately owned Fufeng makes products for animal nutrition, the food and beverage industry, pharmaceuticals, health and wellness, oil and gas, and others industries. It’s a leading producer of xanthan gum. The Grand Forks site was to be its first U.S.-based manufacturing facility, and it was expected to initially require 25 million bushels of corn annually.The U.S. Air Force has told North Dakota leaders that it believes a Chinese company’s plans to build a wet corn milling plant near its Grand Forks base poses a “significant threat to national security,” prompting city officials to say they'll move to stop a project once touted as an economic boon.The Fufeng Group’s planned $700 million facility would be 12 miles (19 kilometers) from the Grand Forks Air Force Base, a location that triggered some local concern about potential espionage.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797687,Nebraska man who shot inside Target got rifle 4 days earlier,"The man who was fatally shot by police after entering a Target store in Omaha, Nebraska, armed with an AR-15-style rifle had obtained the weapon just four days earlier at a Cabela’s sporting goods store, police said Wednesday. No one else was hurt. 

            Court records show that the man, identified by police as Joseph Jones, 32, of suburban Omaha, had no prior felony convictions in Douglas County, where Omaha is located. He also had no prior, documented contact with the city's police, records show. 

            He entered the store around noon Tuesday, where police said he fired several rounds, sending shoppers and workers scrambling for exits and cowering in bathroom stalls. Along with the rifle, he had 13 loaded rifle magazines of ammunition.











            Jones’ uncle, Larry Derksen Jr., said his nephew had schizophrenia and that his mental illness left him isolated. 

            “My nephew went into Target. I believe he had no intention of hurting anybody. He fired off a bunch of rounds,” Derksen told KETV-TV. “He had an AR-15 before law enforcement got there. If he had any intention of killing anybody, he would have. He would have had time to do so.”

            Mental health experts say that most people with mental illness are not violent. They are far more likely to be victims of violent crime than perpetrators, and access to firearms is a big part of the problem.

            Derksen told KETV that “this was predictable” and that his nephew never should have had a gun. 

            Callers flooded 911 dispatchers with around 30 calls for help, and Omaha police officers and a Nebraska State Trooper rushed to the scene. They quickly encountered Jones and ordered him to drop the rifle. 

            Police said Officer Brian Vanderheiden, a 20-year veteran of the city's police force, then fired, striking and killing Jones. The release said Vanderheiden was placed on paid administrative leave per department policy.

            Police haven’t yet released a timeline, showing how long Jones was in the store before officers responded, but Omaha police Lt. Neal Bonacci said they are working on one. 

            After the shooting, officers searched the store three times before declaring the scene safe, according to police. Through the investigation, officers foud bullet casings inside the store. 

            Cabela's didn't immediately respond to emails from The Associated Press seeking comment. 

            Bonacci said police are talking to family as they look for a motive. But he added: “I don’t know that we’ll ever necessarily know.""

            Several other shootings have taken place at stores across the country in recent months, at a time when mass shootings have commanded public attention on a disturbingly frequent basis. 

            In January, one woman was injured in a shooting at a Walmart store in Evansville, Indiana. Police said it could have been much worse if not for heroic actions by an employee and police. Officers arrived within minutes and fatally shot the gunman. A Walmart manager in Chesapeake, Virginia, killed six people in November when he began shooting wildly inside a break room. Six others were wounded. The gunman shot and killed himself before officers arrived.

            In Buffalo, New York, an 18-year-old fatally shot 10 people and injured three others last May, after seeking out a grocery store in a predominately Black neighborhood. Authorities immediately called it a hate crime.

(AP) — Republican lawmakers in Tennessee on Wednesday continued to block Democratic lawmakers from questioning the newly appointed health czar's contentious decision to forgo nearly $9 million in federal funding designed to prevent and treat HIV.

            Earlier this month, news broke that Tennessee would walk away from the funding at the end of May after state officials initially attempted to oust Planned Parenthood from the program in November amid Republican furor over the group's long promotion of abortion access and transgender health care. Abortion is currently banned in Tennessee while Republicans are pushing to prohibit gender-affirming care to minors. 

            The move shocked health advocates, who argue Republican Gov. Bill Lee’s administration chose the “nuclear option” in order to avoid having to work with Planned Parenthood and other organizations that support abortion and transgender rights. They specifically point to Shelby County, which encompasses Memphis, as having one of the highest rates of HIV infections in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.











            Health Commissioner Ralph Alvarado has not answered many questions surrounding the decision, including why the state initially attempted to oust Planned Parenthood from the program. 

            Alvarado was appointed by Lee last fall, but didn't take over the position until Jan. 16, just two days before the department announced it would cut off the HIV federal funding.

            The commissioner was invited to speak Wednesday in front of the House Health Committee on Wednesday to introduce himself. Yet when Democratic Rep. John Ray Clemmons asked about the HIV funding decision, he was gaveled down by Republican Rep. Bryan Terry.

            Terry reprimanded Clemmons that he had promised Alvarado that the meeting would only involve introductions.

            “Don't make me out to be a liar,” he said.

            “Welcome to Tennessee,” Clemmons later said. 

            A similar interaction took place last week when Alvarado was asked to introduce himself in front of the Senate Health Committee. When Democratic members asked Alvarado about his decision involving the HIV funds, the Republican chairman of the panel quickly interrupted and said those questions would be addressed in March when the department presents its budget proposal for the upcoming fiscal year. 

            At both meetings, Alvarado read from a statement that his department has also distributed maintaining that “prior administrations” had decided to accept the federal funding for HIV surveillance. In a letter sent to providers, the state announced that it's since determined “it is in the best interest of Tennesseans for the State to assume direct financial and managerial responsibility for these services.”NASHVILLE, Tenn.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797690,Review: '80 for Brady' is a sports film fumble for the ages,"Tom Brady has officially — and finally, he insists — retired from the National Football League. Based on his new movie “80 For Brady,” it's also time that he immediately retire from filmmaking.

            No one emerges with glory from this syrupy, undercooked story of four older friends who are determined to see Brady lead an astonishing come-from-behind win at the 2017 Super Bowl.

            A quartet of our finest actors — Lily Tomlin, Jane Fonda, Rita Moreno and Sally Field— are sacrificed for cheap laughs and unearned poignancy. And Brady, an executive producer, sullies one of his greatest triumphs. That hissing sound you hear in the theater is not footballs losing air but an audience deflated.











            Screenwriters Sarah Haskins and Emily Halpern seem to have opened a door into exploring loss, obligation and regret in our sunset years, but fumble badly, instead drifting into granny-accidentally-takes-an-edible territory.

            Up on that screen is an EGOT winner, multiple Oscar, Tony and Emmy owners, a recipient of the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor as well as Kennedy Center and Cecil B. DeMille Award honorees. But they are utterly wasted. At one point Field is reduced to participating in a pointless hot wings eating contest.

            There’s nothing wrong with silly buddy movies or celebrating age on screen and it's refreshing to see both bundled here. But don’t tell us you’re empowering older people by making them dance The Twist to get past security into the Super Bowl. Add this to the utter misuse of Diane Keaton in last year's “Mack & Rita,” and we call Hollywood for illegal blindside blocks on people over 70 and a loss of 15 yards.

            Very, very loosely based on actual events, the film is so light plot-wise that it threatens to float away. A ticket mix-up pads a few extra minutes but logic is tossed out, like the time our heroines just happen to find four empty seats in a row just at kickoff — at the Super Bowl. 

            Brady is a constant benevolent presence throughout, whether speaking to Tomlin's character through one of his bobble heads or from TV screens in dialogue only she can hear. “This is going to work out,” he promises.

            Each of our leading ladies get a single note to develop: Fonda plays the vain, boy-crazy author of Rob Gronkowski erotic fan fiction. Field is the sensible, responsible one. Recent widow Moreno is up for any adventure and Tomlin is the glue holding them together.

            When one of the quartet becomes fearful of a recurrence of cancer, Brady becomes her north star and she asks a bust of him what she should do, like a prayer. “He never gives up no matter what he’s up against,” she says. You come to expect a bright halo to appear over Brady’s head.

            Director Kyle Marvin fails to build any real tension as he frighteningly shifts from farce to cringe to melancholy, but real footage of the big game is nicely knitted into the second half. The message here is simple: When you're down, dig deep and go for it. In other words, have the courage to go to a different movie.

            At some points the film just becomes a branding opportunity, like for Microsoft Surface and the theme park NFL Experience. “This is better than my wildest dreams,” one of our august actors is forced to say while throwing footballs. When the four later finagle their way into a skybox during the game, one helpfully explains: “You can see everything!” Yes, from up here, you can see terrible writing.

            This is a movie that is supposed to boost people in their 70s and 80s but has jokes about fanny packs and Pat Sajak. Co-stars Billy Porter, Sara Gilbert and Guy Fieri somehow emerge OK in small roles but the main heroines tread water in what can only be considered an after-school special for older people.

            “80 for Brady,” a Paramount Pictures release that is only in theaters starting Feb. 3, is rated PG-13 for brief strong language, some drug content and some suggestive references. Running time: 98 minutes. Half a star out of four.

            The disappearance Monday of the two emperor tamarin monkeys — named Bella and Finn — and the discovery that their enclosure had been cut were the latest in a string of unusual events at the zoo over the last few weeks, which has included other cut fences, the escape of a small leopard and the suspicious death of an endangered vulture.

            Dallas police said they found the monkeys — who have long whiskers that look like a mustache — late Tuesday afternoon in the closet of a home south of the zoo after getting a tip from the public. No arrests have been made.











            The zoo said Wednesday on Twitter that both Bella and Finn “started eating and drinking almost immediately"" after they were examined, and the two were “so happy to snuggle in their nest sack” on Tuesday night.

            “We will continue to monitor them closely, but for now, we’re so glad they are safe and back with us,” the zoo said in a Wednesday statement. 

            Police had released a photo and video of a man they said they wanted to talk to about the monkeys, and were still seeking him Wednesday. 

            They are also trying to determine if the string of incidents over the last few weeks at the zoo are related or not.

            On Jan. 13, arriving workers found that a clouded leopard named Nova was missing from her cage, and police said that a cutting tool had been intentionally used to make an opening in her enclosure. The zoo closed as a search for her got underway, and she was found later that day near her habitat.

            Zoo workers had also found a similar gash in an enclosure for langur monkeys, though none got out or appeared harmed, police said.

            On Jan. 21, workers arriving at the zoo found an endangered lappet-faced vulture named Pin dead. Gregg Hudson, the zoo's president and CEO, called the death “very suspicious” and said the vulture had “a wound,"" but declined to give further details.

            The zoo said in its Wednesday statement that the incidents over the last few weeks have led officials there to “take a a hard look” at security measures, saying that while what they've had in place has worked in the past “it has become obvious that we need to make significant changes.”

            The zoo said it has already implemented additional security measures that have included adding more cameras, additional fencing and more patrols, and will make other changes as well.

            The zoo said that since Bella and Finn were taken away from the zoo, they'll need to undergo a quarantine period before they can return to their habitat there.

            Meanwhile, in Louisiana, officials said they have launched an investigation after 12 squirrel monkeys were discovered missing Sunday from a zoo in the state's southwest. Their habitat at Zoosiana in Broussard, about 60 miles (96 kilometers) west of Baton Rouge, had been “compromised” and some damage was done to get in, city Police Chief Vance Olivier said Tuesday.DALLAS (AP) — The two small monkeys who were found in a vacant house a day after being taken from the Dallas Zoo lost a bit of weight during their ordeal but show no signs of injury, the zoo said Wednesday.The disappearance Monday of the two emperor tamarin monkeys — named Bella and Finn — and the discovery that their enclosure had been cut were the latest in a string of unusual events at the zoo over the last few weeks, which has included other cut fences, the escape of a small leopard and the suspicious death of an endangered vulture.Dallas police said they found the monkeys — who have long whiskers that look like a mustache — late Tuesday afternoon in the closet of a home south of the zoo after getting a tip from the public.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797694,Atlantic City casino smoking ban bill to get Feb. 13 hearing,"ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) — New Jersey lawmakers will soon discuss a proposed law that would ban smoking in Atlantic City's casinos, the first action in nearly three years on an emotional issue that is dividing casino patrons and sickening some workers.

            The state Senate Health, Human Services and Senior Citizens Committee will hold a hearing Feb. 13 in Trenton to discuss the bill, but does not plan to vote on it that day, according to Sen. Joseph Vitale, one of the measure's sponsors.

            The bill would close a loophole in New Jersey's 2006 indoor smoking law that exempts casinos. Currently, smoking is allowed on up to 25% of the casino floor.











            Similar pushes to end casino smoking are being waged by employees in Rhode Island, Pennsylvania and Virginia.

            Many casino workers have been pushing for years for a total ban on casino smoking, saying the secondhand smoke is making them ill.

            The casinos fear a total smoking ban would cost the industry revenue and jobs, although smoking opponents dispute that assertion.

            “This hearing means that Atlantic City casino workers are one step closer to not having to choose between their health and a paycheck,"" said Cynthia Hallett, president and CEO of Americans for Nonsmokers’ Rights. “It’s a historic moment in the fight to protect the health of thousands of New Jersey workers. Dealers bear the brunt of the dangerous secondhand smoke more harshly than anyone else working in casinos, and their voices must carry the most weight.”

            Vitale said the hearing is intended to foster “a thorough discussion with the committee on how this bill will affect casino employees, customers and the gaming industry.""

            Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy has promised to sign the bill if it passes the Legislature.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797696,"Signing day ends recruiting sagas for QB Rashada, CB McClain","The opening of college football's traditional signing period for high school prospects brought an apparent end to two of the cycle's most notable recruitments.

            Blue-chip quarterback Jaden Rashada, who signed with Florida in December and then asked to be released from the commitment when a name, imagine and likeness deal fell through, announced Wednesday he is going to Arizona State.

            “Glad to truly be home!” Rashada posted on Twitter.











            Also in the Pac-12, Cormani McClain, previously committed to Miami, signed with Colorado to make it two straight years that coach Deion Sanders has landed a five-star cornerback.

            Rashada's recruitment made national headlines and became something of a cautionary tale for the college football's NIL era.

            The four-star recruit from California was the focal point of a recruiting fight between Miami and Florida. That led to a bidding war between booster-run collectives that try to secure sponsorship deals for athletes from those schools.

            Rashada had originally given a verbal commitment to Miami, but flipped to Florida and signed with the Gators during the early signing period after being offered an NIL deal that could have been worth more than $13 million.

            When it became clear that Gator Collective, which is not part of the University of Florida or its athletic department, did not have the money to fund the deal, Rashada asked to be released from his national letter of intent. Florida granted the request.

            Gators coach Billy Napier told reporters he could not provide details on what happened with Rashada, but did say he did not anticipated hearing from the NCAA about possible violations of recruiting rules.

            ""I think the reality is the current structure of NIL with third parties being involved, with agents being involved, with marketing representatives, with lawyers, with collectives, very fluid and I think a very unique dynamic,"" Napier said. “I think ultimately NIL is a strength for the Gators.”

            Rashada becomes the highest-profile high school recruit in new Arizona State coach Kenny Dillingham's first signing class. The 32-year-old Phoenix native and Arizona State graduate was hired in December.

            Rashada's father, Harlen, was part of Arizona State's football team in the 1990s. Jaden Rashada called ASU his “childhood dream school.”

            “Can't wait to carry on the family name at the University and start my journey. Forks up!” Rashada posted.

            McClain's recruitment was more traditional in its twists and turns. One of the highest-rated players in the country, he was pursued by most of college football's most successful programs, including Alabama, Georgia and Ohio State.

            The Lakeland, Florida, product committed to Miami last fall, but even then it seemed he might be lured away from the Hurricanes by the Crimson Tide. 

            Then Coach Prime took over in Boulder, Colorado, and changed the game.

            Last year, Sanders made recruiting history when he swayed five-star cornerback Travis Hunter to renege on a verbal commitment to Florida State and sign with Jackson State.

            Never before had a player rated that highly signed at a school that plays in Division I football's second tier, the Championship Subdivision.

            Colorado hired Sanders to turn around a program that has been stuck near the bottom of the Pac-12 for most of the last decade. McClain visited Boulder last month and soon after committed to become the first five-star to sign with the Buffaloes in more than a decade.

            He made it official early on signing day. McClain will join Hunter, who transferred to Colorado, in the Buffs' secondary.

            “First time CU signed two five-star players in the same class,” Sanders said. “Same position, by the way, and both of them are dogs. I can’t wait to see them play together.”

            SOUTH CAROLINA SPEEDSTER

            Nyckoles Harbor from Washington was one of the few five stars, as rated by 247 Sports' composite rankings, who entered signing day uncommitted with real mystery surrounding where he would end up.

            The decision came down to Oregon and South Carolina and the Gamecocks were the choice for the 6-foot-5, 225-pound edge rusher who might wind up playing receiver in college.

            
                Harbor runs track, has posted elite times in the 100 and 200 and has Olympic aspirations.

            STILL DUCK SEASON

            Oregon drew a lot of attention during the early signing period, winning a handful of high-profile recruiting battles to be in position to have the Pac-12's highest rated class.

            The Ducks missed out on Harbor but had one more big score, landing four-star cornerback Rodrick Pleasant. The California player picked Oregon over Pac-12 rival — at least for another year — Southern California.

            ""Ultimately, we want to sign the best players everywhere but if you can win in your footprint, and our footprint, certainly California is part of that, we want to have success there and think this year we proved that we’re able to do that,” Lanning told reporters.

            USC, which moves to the Big Ten after the 2023-24 school year, did get a signing day win with four-star tight end Walker Lyons.

            FINAL SCORE

            Alabama had already locked up the No. 1 recruiting class in the country for the 10th time in 13 years before the February signing period.

            The Tide landed nine five stars. There were only 39 players given a five-star rating in the class, according to 247's composite.

            Two-time defending national champion Georgia was second, followed by Texas, Oklahoma and Ohio State. The rest of the top 10 were LSU, Miami, Oregon, Tennessee and Notre Dame.

            While there has been much angst over the impact of NIL money being used as a recruiting inducement, the early results suggests it isn't changing which schools are coming away with the highest-rated classes.

            Using a five-year average of recruiting rankings from the 247 composite, here are the top 20 schools from 2017-21.

            1. Alabama, 2 (average ranking)

            2. Georgia, 2.2

            3. Ohio State, 5

            16. Florida State, 16.0

            17. Tennessee, 16.8

            18. USC, 19.6

            19. Washington, 20.0

            20. Nebraska 20.6.

            Over the past two years (2022 and '23), 17 of the top 20 teams remain in the top 20. USC was knocked out by an unusually low 70th place in 2022. 

            1. Alabama, 1.5

            2. Georgia, 2.5

That led to a bidding war between booster-run collectives that try to secure sponsorship deals for athletes from those schools.Rashada had originally given a verbal commitment to Miami, but flipped to Florida and signed with the Gators during the early signing period after being offered an NIL deal that could have been worth more than $13 million.When it became clear that Gator Collective, which is not part of the University of Florida or its athletic department, did not have the money to fund the deal, Rashada asked to be released from his national letter of intent. Florida granted the request.Gators coach Billy Napier told reporters he could not provide details on what happened with Rashada, but did say he did not anticipated hearing from the NCAA about possible violations of recruiting rules.""I think the reality is the current structure of NIL with third parties being involved, with agents being involved, with marketing representatives, with lawyers, with collectives, very fluid and I think a very unique dynamic,"" Napier said. “I think ultimately NIL is a strength for the Gators.”Rashada becomes the highest-profile high school recruit in new Arizona State coach Kenny Dillingham's first signing class.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797697,"Napier avoids Rashada details, doesn't expect NCAA inquiry","GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) — Florida coach Billy Napier provided little insight Wednesday into how and why the Gators lost four-star quarterback Jaden Rashada, but said he doesn't expect it to prompt an NCAA investigation.

            Napier sidestepped several questions about Rashada, who signed with Florida in December only to be granted his release a month later following a failed name, image and likeness deal worth more than $13 million. Napier repeatedly said NCAA rules prohibited him from providing details.

            “I wish we could get into the specifics, but we’re not allowed to,” Napier said. “I think the reality is the current structure of NIL with third parties being involved, with agents being involved, with marketing representatives, with lawyers, with collectives, (is) very fluid, and I think a very unique dynamic.”











            Rashada, who threw for 5,275 yards and 59 touchdowns at Pittsburg (Calif.) High last season, was granted his release on Jan. 20 and announced on social media Wednesday that he’s committed to his father’s alma mater, Arizona State.

            Rashada bailed on Florida after the Gator Collective — an independent fundraising group that’s loosely tied to the university and pays student-athletes for use of their name, image and likeness — failed to honor a multiyear deal that was signed by both sides.

            The bombshell came a little more than two months after Rashada switched his verbal commitment from Miami to Florida. Rashada, his representatives and the Gator Collective had presumably agreed to terms on the lucrative deal at the time of his flip.

            Rashada declined to enroll with other signees days after playing in a Jan. 3 all-star game in nearby Orlando. The 19-year-old eventually returned to the West Coast and started looking at other schools.

            It’s unclear when Napier realized the deal was falling apart or how much he even knew about the NIL deal. NCAA rules prohibit coaches from being involved in striking NIL deals with current players or prospective ones.

            “I think you spend your entire life, your entire career trying to establish who you are and how you operate,” Napier said. “I think, ultimately, I can lay my head down at night based off of that. … Ultimately, the good thing here is I have a lot of confidence with our leadership, strategy that we’re deploying, how it’s benefitting our team -- the group of players we have on our team. I think we’re going about it the right way.”

            Napier also expressed frustration with the way NIL deals and the recruiting portal have dramatically changed the landscape of college football.

            “I think every college football coach would tell you they’re frustrated,” he said. “We’re living in a fluid dynamic. There’s a lot of good things about NIL, but I think the combination of the NIL and the portal creates a dynamic. 

            ""We’re all aware of the issues and the parameters we’re competing in at this point. I think as time goes the market will settle down.”

            Rashada is the fifth scholarship quarterback to leave Florida since Napier's arrival, following Anthony Richardson (NFL draft), backup Jalen Kitna (dismissed following his arrest on child pornography charges), Emory Jones (transferred to Arizona State) and Carlos Del Rio-Wilson (transferred to Syracuse).

            The Gators have just three QBs on scholarship: Wisconsin transfer and projected starter Graham Mertz, Jack Miller and Max Brown. Napier said he will be in the market for another transfer this spring.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797698,LeBron watch: Saturday's Lakers-Pelicans game moved to ESPN2,"LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers are getting a national television audience on Saturday.

            Just in case.

            
                With James closing in on Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's career scoring record, the NBA has moved the Lakers' game at New Orleans up two hours to a 6 p.m. Eastern start. The Lakers-Pelicans game will also be aired on ESPN2, preceding a national broadcast between Dallas and Golden State at 8:30 p.m. on ABC.











            James and the Lakers play at Indiana on Thursday. He will enter that game needing 89 points to pass Abdul-Jabbar, who has been the league's leading scorer since 1984.

            NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said last month in Paris, when asked about the league's plans for James' potential record-breaking game, that the league “would look at making sure that game isn’t just national in the United States but globally available if he’s anywhere within a reasonable amount of points of breaking that record.""

            James is averaging 30.2 points per game. At that pace, the record-breaker is likely to be Tuesday when the Lakers host Oklahoma City — provided James doesn't miss any games in the interim. The NBA has not yet said how, or if, the Lakers-Thunder game would be nationally televised. TNT is scheduled to broadcast two games that night, Atlanta at New Orleans followed by Minnesota at Denver.

            If James doesn't have the record after the Feb. 7 game, his next game is already scheduled for national TV. The Lakers' home game Feb. 9 against Milwaukee — the team that Abdul-Jabbar started his career with, before he joined the Lakers — will be shown on TNT.

            Abdul-Jabbar retired with 38,387 points in a 20-season career. James, in his 20th season, has scored 38,299.
