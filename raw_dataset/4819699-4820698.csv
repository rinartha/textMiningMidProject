https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819699,Roald Dahl's works and the role of sensitivity readers,"Last week, Britain's The Telegraph reported that the publishing house Puffin had made hundreds of changes to the characters and language in British author Roald Dahl's famous children's books. This included making the diminutive Oompa-Loompas in ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" gender neutral and calling Augustus Gloop ""enormous"" rather than ""fat,"" after sensitivity readers were hired to read the books and flag any potential offensive content.While a spokesman for the Roald Dahl company said the changes were ""small and well-considered,"" the announcement prompted an outcry by a variety of literary figures, as well as the UK's new conservative prime minister Rishi Sunak, who said via a spokesperson that ""works of fiction should be preserved and not airbrushed."" Author Sir Salman Rushdie was amongst those who spoke out against the changes.Yet, whether one agrees or disagrees with the way Dahl's books have been updated in English, the debate offered an opportunity to learn about a fairly new, but significant profession — that of the sensitivity reader. In short, sensitivity readers are hired by publishing houses to read for offensive content, misrepresentation, stereotypes, bias and lack of understanding of minority groups.""I think a lot of people are hearing about the job in the context of 'Oh, the woke mob are coming for your favourite literature and they're debasing all the best books.' But this is a load of nonsense, frankly,"" says Helen Gould, a professional writer based in the UK who has been working as a sensitivity reader since 2017. DW spoke to her to learn what the job entails.""A sensitivity reader is just a different kind of editor and we're just looking for things that may not be coming across in the way that the author intended them to,"" Gould clarifies.She got her start by helping a friend who created a tabletop world-playing game — think Dungeons and Dragons — for potentially offensive content, and has since reviewed content in a wide variety of mediums, including fiction.""I have even done a bit of non-fiction where people have been writing about the histories of people of color, but they haven't been people of color themselves, for example. And so they might be making tongue in cheek jokes or something in the text and it's my job to tell them 'Oh, I don't think that's going to land'.""Gold's approach to sensitivity reading is to read a text with two questions in mind: ""Is this potentially going to cause harm? And if so, how can we make it not cause harm?""She also explains that contrary to what some might perceive, sensitivity readers do not go through texts with a red pen, intoning ""Oh you can't say this."" Instead, she looks for nuance and complexity, citing for example characters that appear rather two dimensional and may perpetuate stereotypes. ""I might say, 'Oh, this is a Black character who is almost always angry. Have you considered giving them another dimension to their personality?""In the end, Gould sends her suggestions to the publisher who relays them to the author. Most of the time, authors are receptive and have taken her suggestions into account.Each sensitivity reader has different specialities. Gould specialises in race and politics. On the day she spoke with DW, she was working on a project where the authors were concerned about reproducing colonialist attitudes. UK agency Salt & Sage works with freelance editors and sensitivity readers, including Gould, lists profiles of the sensitivity readers they work with, and their areas of expertise — including topics related to non-binary identities, PTSD or anxiety and depression, among others.""Some people will be best at looking at subjects with trans characters, some people will be best looking at subjects with Jewish characters. It's all going to depend on one's lived experience and expertise,"" explains Gould. She says she commonly refers authors to sensitivity readers with different specialities if she feels they could be best be helped by that person.For her part, Gould believes the job of a sensitivity reader is most useful for works that have not yet been published.Gould says she finds it frustrating when asked to read something that has been previously published: ""Personally I don't think that sensitivity reading is useful if something is already published because the work is already out there — the horse has bolted from the stable, so to speak."" Instead, Gould says the approach that multi-national company Disney has done on its older animated films, some of which contain racist tropes, is the best. Disney put a warning at the start of these films advising that the content is insensitive. Gould feels the same could be done with books.""If you want to go back really far, I wouldn't say to change Shakespeare's 'Othello' because it depicts a Black man as giving in to anger and being stereotypically violent,"" says Gould.""But I would say to keep these stereotypes in mind when you're reading it — keep in mind the context of the time, the racism of the time and the fact that the author was a white dude, because that will actually help you get a deeper understanding of the text and what it might be trying to say,"" she adds.Yet whether the profession will become standard in the industry or fade into oblivion over time, is unclear. Gould thinks it could go either way.""On the one hand, 99% of the publishers and editors that I've worked with have been really keen to make sure that they're representing marginalized groups and characters in the right ways, and they want to make sure that their readers are going to enjoy their work and so on. Yeah, but recently we're seeing a massive amount of sort of right-wing backlash to the various bits of progress that we've been making since the nineties.""In a 2022 diversity and inclusion study put out by the UK Publishers Association, only 17% of people surveyed were non-white and there was a lack of class diversity.In an article published on The Conversation, author Sarah Jilani, a lecturer in English at City, University London, points out that collaboration is vital in the publishing scene, and that sensitivity readers are a necessary part of the process to bringing the manuscript to print, especially considering the lack of diversity in the industry.Gould wants the world to know that sensitivity readers are there to help authors, not censor them.In the age of social media, it can be ""scary"" for authors to publish their work, as it comes under immediate scrutiny, she says: ""We can help an author have the confidence that they've addressed a topic properly.""Edited by: Brenda Haas",2023/02/23,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819700,Stockholm police head found dead after report criticized him,"STOCKHOLM (AP) — A senior Swedish police officer has been found dead in his home, hours after the release of an internal report that found a conflict of interest regarding decisions he had made about a former employee with whom he had a relationship, police said.

            Mats Löfving, the chief of police in the Stockholm region, was found dead in his home in the city of Norrkoping, police said. He was 61.

            The cause of death was not immediately clear and police opened an investigation as a matter of standard procedure.











            Löfving’s conduct was under review both by an internal audit and a criminal investigation, in a case that shook Sweden’s police leadership and made headlines across the Scandinavian nation. 

            The probes focused on his relationship with a female employee while he was the head of the police National Operations Department.

            The internal investigation on Wednesday found there was a conflict of interest when Löfving made decisions regarding the employee's salary and position. The investigator said those decisions raised questions about Löfving's judgement as a manager and suggested that the police leadership consider terminating his employment.

            Later Wednesday, police responding to a report of an injured person at Löfving's home found him dead inside.

            “It is incredibly tragic,"" Sweden's chief of police Anders Thornberg said late Wednesday. “My thoughts go to Mats Löfving, his next of kin and work colleagues.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819701,Dr. Seuss' 'How the Grinch stole Christmas!' gets a sequel,"BOSTON (AP) — Dr. Seuss fans might find their hearts growing three sizes this coming holiday season with the release of a sequel to the 1957 classic children's book “How the Grinch Stole Christmas!”

            The new book picks up one year after the original, and like the first, teaches a valuable lesson about the true spirit of the holiday, Dr. Seuss Enterprises and Random House Children’s Books announced Thursday.

            The sequel entitled “How the Grinch Lost Christmas!” is not based on a newly discovered manuscript by Seuss — whose real name was Theodor Geisel — but was written and illustrated by an author and artist with previous experience in the Dr. Seuss universe.











            “One of the most asked questions we receive from Seuss fans of all ages is ‘What do you think happened to the Grinch after he stole Christmas?” said Alice Jonaitis, executive editor at Random House Children’s Books, in a statement.

            The original Grinch book has sold nearly 10 million copies in North America alone and like other Seuss books has been translated into multiple languages. It was made into a 1966 animated TV special narrated by Boris Karloff, a 2000 live-action movie starring Jim Carrey and a computer-animated film in 2018 with Benedict Cumberbatch voicing the Grinch.

            The new book, scheduled for release Sept. 5, is written by Alastair Heim and illustrated by Aristides Ruiz. Heim has written Seuss-themed books like “If I Ran Your School"" and “I Am the Cat in the Hat.” Ruiz has illustrated the Cat in the Hat’s Learning Library books for more than two decades.

            “All throughout writing the story, I couldn’t fully believe that I was actually getting to play in the amazing creative sandbox Dr. Seuss created all those decades ago,” Heim said in an email.

            Working on the Grinch sequel was an awesome responsibility, Ruiz said via email.

            “When I heard of the opportunity to be a part of this project, I jumped at the chance only to find that it was difficult and daunting to approach adding to or expanding such an esteemed and treasured part of the American Christmas canon,"" he said.

            In the original, the Grinch tries to ruin Christmas for the people of Who-ville by making off in the middle of the night with all the material trappings and sumptuous food of the holiday.

            When the Whos gather to sing on Christmas morning, the Grinch realizes that the holiday is not about toys and feasting, but about joyously celebrating with family and neighbors and as Seuss wrote, the Grinch's “heart grew three sizes that day.” 

            In the sequel, the Grinch wants to show how much he loves the holiday by winning Who-ville’s Christmas Crown with the most spectacular Christmas tree ever seen, according to Dr. Seuss Enterprises.

            But when his plan goes awry, the Grinch turns into his old, cold-hearted self, until his friend Cindy-Lou Who, reminds him that Christmas is not all about winning.

            Geisel, who died in 1991 at age 87, authored dozens of books, including “Green Eggs and Ham” and “The Cat in the Hat.” 

            Some of his work has been criticized in recent years because of racist imagery that in 2021 prompted Dr. Seuss Enterprises to cease publication of six books, including “And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street” and “If I Ran the Zoo.”

            But his work remains popular. Forbes magazine ranked him eighth on a 2022 list of the highest-paid dead celebrities, with $32 million in earnings.BOSTON (AP) — Dr. Seuss fans might find their hearts growing three sizes this coming holiday season with the release of a sequel to the 1957 classic children's book “How the Grinch Stole Christmas!”The new book picks up one year after the original, and like the first, teaches a valuable lesson about the true spirit of the holiday, Dr. Seuss Enterprises and Random House Children’s Books announced Thursday.The sequel entitled “How the Grinch Lost Christmas!” is not based on a newly discovered manuscript by Seuss — whose real name was Theodor Geisel — but was written and illustrated by an author and artist with previous experience in the Dr. Seuss universe.“One of the most asked questions we receive from Seuss fans of all ages is ‘What do you think happened to the Grinch after he stole Christmas?” said Alice Jonaitis, executive editor at Random House Children’s Books, in a statement.The original Grinch book has sold nearly 10 million copies in North America alone and like other Seuss books has been translated into multiple languages.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819702,IndyCar to use sustainable tires made from desert shrub,"In IndyCar’s effort toward environmental sustainability, one of the world’s largest tire manufacturers will rely on a desert shrub to produce a new source of natural rubber for its tires. 

            Bridgestone Americas said Thursday it has used the offseason to incorporate more sustainable and bio-circular materials into its tires this season. That made it possible for Firestone to provide tires with rubber derived from the guayule desert shrub at all five street circuits of the 17-race IndyCar season.

            The tires will make their season debut in next week's opener on the downtown streets of St. Petersburg. The tires were tried twice last season — during the pit-stop challenge at the Indianapolis 500 and the street race at Nashville.











            “We are driving sustainability in every area of our business, and we’re thrilled to be advancing guayule and other sustainable practices in America’s premier open-wheel racing series,” said Paolo Ferrari, CEO of Bridgestone Americas. “Firestone has a tremendous legacy of innovation and performance in racing, which we will continue to build upon as we move into this new era of cleaner, safer and more sustainable mobility on and off the track.”

            Bridgestone last year advanced an additional $42 million to establish commercial operations for planting and harvesting the rubber-rich guayule shrub. The guayule plant, which is native to Northern Mexico and the Southwestern United States, bears small white flowers and narrow silvery leaves that grows in hot, arid desert areas with plenty of sun and little water.

            In addition to the to the guayule street tires, the majority of race tires used this season will be manufactured at the energy-efficient Advanced Test Production Center. The center received International Sustainability and Carbon Certification PLUS recognition for its transparency and traceability of sustainable raw materials.

            Also, Firestone will use ISCC mass balance certified synthetic rubber made with recycled plastics in all race tires during the Indianapolis 500.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819703,Pregnant Russians flock to Argentina seeking new passports,"BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — Shortly after Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine, Alla Prigolovkina and her husband, Andrei Ushakov, decided they had to flee their Sochi, Russia, home.

            Ushakov had been detained for holding up a sign that read “Peace,” and Prigolovkina, a pregnant ski instructor, feared he would soon be drafted and potentially killed, leaving their baby fatherless.

            The original plan was to stay in Europe, but anti-Russian sentiment discouraged them.











            “We chose Argentina because it has everything we needed: Fantastic nature, a large country, beautiful mountains,” Prigolovkina, 34, told The Associated Press inside the home her family is renting in Argentina’s western Mendoza province. “We felt it would be ideal for us.” 

            They were hardly alone.

            Over the past year, Argentine immigration authorities have noticed flights packed with dozens of pregnant Russians. But whereas Prigolovkina said her family intends to build a life here at the foot of the Andes mountains, local officials believe many of the other recent Russian visitors are singularly focused on receiving one of Argentina’s passports.

            All children born in Argentina automatically receive citizenship and having an Argentine child speeds up the process for the parents to obtain residency permits and, after a couple of years, their own passports.

            Crucially, the navy blue booklets allow entry to 171 countries without a visa, a backup plan that Russians believe could come in handy in the ever-uncertain future. Due to sanctions, Russians have also had trouble opening bank accounts in foreign countries, something an Argentine passport could solve.

            According to official figures, some 22,200 Russians entered Argentina over the last year, including 10,777 women — many of whom were in the advanced stages of pregnancy. In January, 4,523 Russians entered Argentina, more than four times the 1,037 that arrived in the same month last year.

            After an investigation, Argentine officials concluded that Russian women, generally from affluent backgrounds, were entering the country as tourists with the plan to give birth, obtain their documentation and leave. More than half of the Russians who entered the country in the last year, 13,134, already left, including 6,400 women.

            “We detected that they don’t come to do tourism, they come to have children,” Florencia Carignano, the national director for migration, said during a meeting with international media.

            Although Argentina generally has a relatively permissive immigration process, the recent arrest of two alleged Russian spies who had Argentine passports in Slovenia raised alarms in the South American country, where officials reinforced immigration controls. 

            “We canceled residencies of Russians who spent more time outside than in,” Carignano said, expressing concern the Argentine “passport will cease to have the trust it enjoys in all countries.”

            Immigration authorities have also called on the justice system to investigate agencies that allegedly offer assistance to Russian women who want to give birth in Argentina.

            It’s unclear how many women have left Russia to give birth in the last year, but the issue is big enough that lawmakers in Moscow this month raised the question of whether those who choose to give birth abroad should be stripped of the so-called maternity fund that all Russian mothers receive — a financial benefit of almost $8,000 for the first child and about $10,500 for the second.

            There is no discussion on whether to cut off access to the maternity fund for Russian mothers who give birth abroad, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said.

            The phenomenon also is not entirely new. Prior to the Russia-Ukraine war, Russian women were part of a wave of “birth tourists” in the U.S. and many paid brokers tens of thousands of dollars to arrange their travel documents, accommodations and hospital stays, often in Florida.

            Embarking on a long journey during an advanced pregnancy can be particularly perilous, and Russians in Argentina insist that their decision to leave their homes goes beyond a new passport. Despite the government’s claims, some at least seem eager to make Argentina their new home.

            In spite of the language barrier and the unfamiliar, stifling summer heat, Prigolovkina and Ushakov have quickly adopted Argentine customs since their July move. Prigolovkina said they especially enjoy spending time in the park with their dogs. And while the family may not have been interested in soccer in Russia, they happily cheered when their newly adopted country won the World Cup late last year.

            Still, she also concedes that obtaining a passport for their newborn son, Lev Andrés, was a motivating factor for the move: “We wanted our baby to have the chance to not just be Russian and have a single passport.”

            Some experts say a country in which migrants once made up as much as 30% of the population should be particularly sensitive to the plight of Russians trying to start a new life. The South American country was transformed in the late 19th and early 20th century by the influx of millions of European migrants, including many from Italy and Spain.

            “Given our history of migration, a country like ours should empathize more with the humanitarian dimension” of these recent immigrants, Natalia Debandi, a social scientist and migrations expert who is a researcher at the publicly funded CONICET institute, said. “They are not terrorists, they are people.”

            A study by immigration agents based on interviews with 350 newly arrived Russians concluded that most are married and largely well-off professionals who have remote jobs in finance and digital design or live off savings.

            Days before giving birth to a boy named Leo, 30-year-old Russian psychologist Ekaterina Gordienko lauded her experience in Argentina, saying “the health care system is very good, and people are very kind. My only problem is Spanish. If the doctor doesn’t speak English, I use the (Google) translator.”

            Gordienko arrived in the nation's capital of Buenos Aires in December with her 38-year-old husband, Maxim Levoshin. “The first thing we want is for Leo to live in a safe country, without a war in his future,” Levoshin said. 

            In Mendoza, Prigolovkina is excited for her family’s new life in Argentina and optimistic they will be able to give back to the country that has welcomed them.

            “We have left everything behind to live in peace. I hope that Argentines understand that Russians can be very useful in different areas of life, in business, the economy, in science,” she said. “They can help make Argentina better.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819707,Netanyahu gets funding boost under shadow of economic woes,"TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — An Israeli parliamentary committee on Thursday approved new funding for Benjamin Netanyahu and his family, giving the prime minister a boost in personal spending at a time when he is facing mass protests over his policies and as the economy is on shaky ground.

            The committee voted to approve public funds to cover expenses incurred by the Netanyahus at their private homes in Jerusalem and the exclusive seaside town of Caesarea, as well as an increase of thousands of dollars a year in clothing expenses for both Netanyahu and his wife, Sara.

            The approved funding is bound to compound what critics say is the Netanyahus' reputation for being out of touch with regular Israelis.











            “The shekel is crashing, investors are fleeing, interest rates are soaring, hundreds of thousands of citizens can’t make ends meet but the finance committee approved the Netanyahu family’s request to fund two residences at the expense of taxpayers,” the opposition Yesh Atid party said.

            “Another reason Netanyahu is out of touch with the people. Another reason for preferring themselves at our expense,” it added.

            Thursday's development comes as the country is deeply divided over a plan by Netanyahu's government to overhaul the judicial system and as the economy faces new challenges, with inflation rising and the shekel weakening against the dollar. 

            Leading economists say the legal changes, which aim to weaken the authority of the Supreme Court, will exacerbate the country's economic problems by driving investors away.

            The official prime minister's residence is undergoing renovations. Former Prime Minister Naftali Bennett also faced criticism for a pricy upgrade of his private home while the official residence was unavailable. Bennett said the changes were required by security officials and approved by the country's attorney general.

            The Netanyahus have repeatedly been embroiled in scandals over their spending and expensive tastes. 

            The prime minister has long been saddled with an image as a cigar-smoking, cognac-drinking socialite, while his wife has come under scrutiny for alleged abusive behavior toward staff.

            Netanyahu is on trial for corruption, including one affair in which he allegedly accepted champagne and cigars from wealthy associates. He was also lambasted for advancing a costly plan to outfit a plane for his official trips.

            The couple has come under fire for spending at their homes in the past. In 2015, Israel’s state comptroller, an official watchdog, cited large sums of public money spent on food, furniture, cleaning and gardening at the couple’s official and private residences. It also said they pocketed proceeds from recycling bottles that had been purchased for entertaining official guests.TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — An Israeli parliamentary committee on Thursday approved new funding for Benjamin Netanyahu and his family, giving the prime minister a boost in personal spending at a time when he is facing mass protests over his policies and as the economy is on shaky ground.The committee voted to approve public funds to cover expenses incurred by the Netanyahus at their private homes in Jerusalem and the exclusive seaside town of Caesarea, as well as an increase of thousands of dollars a year in clothing expenses for both Netanyahu and his wife, Sara.The approved funding is bound to compound what critics say is the Netanyahus' reputation for being out of touch with regular Israelis.“The shekel is crashing, investors are fleeing, interest rates are soaring, hundreds of thousands of citizens can’t make ends meet but the finance committee approved the Netanyahu family’s request to fund two residences at the expense of taxpayers,” the opposition Yesh Atid party said.“Another reason Netanyahu is out of touch with the people.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819715,Toxic wastewater from Ohio train derailment moved to Texas,"DEER PARK, Texas (AP) — Toxic wastewater used to extinguish a fire following a train derailment in Ohio has been transported to a Houston suburb for disposal, according to a county official in Texas who said there are outstanding questions about the transportation and disposal of the material.

            Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo said at a press conference Thursday that 500,000 gallons (1.8 million liters) of the wastewater had been delivered to Deer Park, Texas. 

            “I know that our community was taken aback by the news just as I was,"" Hidalgo said. ""I also want folks to know there are many things we don’t know that we should know. That doesn’t mean that something is wrong. And I want to stress that point.”











            Hidalgo said the county on Wednesday learned of the wastewater transfer from the site of a fiery Feb. 3 derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, which prompted evacuations when toxic chemicals were burned after being released from five derailed tanker rail cars carrying vinyl choride that were in danger of exploding.

            The wastewater has been delivered to Texas Molecular, which injects hazardous waste into the ground for disposal. The company told KHOU-TV it is experienced in managing this type of disposal.

            “Our technology safely removes hazardous constituents from the biosphere. We are part of the solution to reduce risk and protect the environment, whether in our local area or other places that need the capabilities we offer to protect the environment,” the company said.

            Hidalgo said Texas Molecular informed county officials that it had taken delivery of a half million gallons of firefighting water with the expectation of an additional 1.5 million gallons hauled to the site by about 30 trucks per day.

            ""It’s a very real problem we were told yesterday the materials were coming only to learn today they’ve been here for a week,” said Hidalgo, who wants more information on precautions taken at the injection well.

            The delivery also raises questions about the methods of transport, which she said may include trains, and the possible health impact on workers involved in the transfers and the communities between the Ohio crash site and the disposal area in Deer Park, one of 34 communities in Harris County.

            Uncertainties remain even after discussions between the county and officials from the federal Department of Transportation and Environmental Protection Agency, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and other industry and environment experts, Hidalgo said.

            “The government officials have readily provided the information they have, but what we’re learning is that they themselves don’t seem to have the full information,"" she said. ""I’m not clear on who has the full picture of what is happening here and that is a problem,"" 

            She noted Harris County has around 10 injection wells capable of receiving hazardous commercial waste, making the area one of the few places where the materials could be disposed. But she said there are similar facilities in Vickery, Ohio, and Romulus, Michigan, that also could handle the wastewater and are located closer to the crash site.

            “There may be logistical reasons for all of this. There may be economic reasons. Perhaps Texas Molecular outbid the Michigan facility,” Hidalgo said. “It doesn’t mean there’s something nefarious going on, but we do need to know the answer to this question."" 

            Hidalgo added that she first learned Harris County was the disposal site from a journalist, “not from a regulatory agency, not from the company,"" which she said was ""unacceptable.”

            The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality told KTRK-TV that Texas Molecular “is authorized to accept and manage a variety of waste streams, including vinyl chloride, as part of their ... hazardous waste permit and underground injection control permit.”

            Dr. George Guillen, executive director of the Environmental Institute of Houston, said the chemical is “very, very toxic” but the risk to the public is minimal.

            “This injection, in some cases, is usually 4,000 or 5,000 feet down below any kind of drinking water aquifer,” said Guillen, a University of Houston-Clear Lake professor of biology and environmental science.

            Guillen and Deer Park resident Tammy Baxter said their greatest concerns are transporting the chemicals more than 1,300 miles (2,090 kilometers) from East Palestine to Deer Park.

            “There has to be a closer deep well injection,” Baxter told KTRK. “It’s foolish to put it on the roadway. We have accidents on a regular basis ... It is silly to move it that far.”

            Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who visited the derailment site Thursday, has warned the railroad responsible for the derailment, Norfolk Southern, to fulfill its promises to clean up the mess just outside East Palestine and help the town recover.

            Buttigieg also has announced a package of reforms intended to improve rail safety while regulators try to strengthen safety rules.DEER PARK, Texas (AP) — Toxic wastewater used to extinguish a fire following a train derailment in Ohio has been transported to a Houston suburb for disposal, according to a county official in Texas who said there are outstanding questions about the transportation and disposal of the material.Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo said at a press conference Thursday that 500,000 gallons (1.8 million liters) of the wastewater had been delivered to Deer Park, Texas.“I know that our community was taken aback by the news just as I was,"" Hidalgo said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819718,US nominates Ajay Banga for World Bank president,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The United States is nominating former Mastercard CEO Ajay Banga to lead the World Bank, President Joe Biden announced on Thursday, crediting him with critical experience on global challenges including climate change. 

            The news comes days after Trump appointee David Malpass announced plans to step down in June from his role leading the 189-nation poverty reduction agency. His five-year term was due to expire in April 2024.

            Addressing the impacts of climate change at the multilateral bank is a priority for the U.S. And leading climate figures have urged the Biden administration to use Malpass' early departure as an opening to overhaul the powerful financial institution, which has been increasingly criticized as hostile to less-wealthy nations and efforts to address climate change.











            Malpass ran into criticism last year for seeming, in comments at a conference, to cast doubt on the science that says the burning of fossil fuels causes global warming. He later apologized and said he had misspoken, noting that the bank routinely relies on climate science.

            Banga, currently vice chairman at private equity firm General Atlantic, has more than 30 years of business experience, having served in various roles at Mastercard and the boards of the American Red Cross, Kraft Foods and Dow Inc. He is the first Indian-born nominee to the World Bank president role. 

            “Ajay is uniquely equipped to lead the World Bank at this critical moment in history,"" Biden said in a statement, adding that Banga “has critical experience mobilizing public-private resources to tackle the most urgent challenges of our time, including climate change.”

            Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement that Banga's experience “will help him achieve the World Bank’s objectives of eliminating extreme poverty and expanding shared prosperity while pursuing the changes needed to effectively evolve the institution,” which include meeting “ambitious goals for climate adaptation and emissions reduction.”

            Biden's climate envoy, John Kerry, said on Twitter that Banga was “the right choice.""

            “He can help put in place new policies that help deploy the large sums of money necessary to reduce global emissions and help developing and vulnerable countries adapt, build resilience, and mitigate the impact of greenhouse gases,"" Kerry tweeted.

            The United States has traditionally picked the World Bank chief. The head of its sister agency, the International Monetary Fund, has traditionally come from Europe. But critics have called for an end to that arrangement and for developing countries to gain a bigger voice in the two organizations.

            The World Bank has promised to conduct “an open, merit-based and transparent selection process″ and said it would accept nominations through March 29.

            Eric LeCompte, executive director of the anti-poverty coalition Jubilee USA Network, said the United States was “looking to nominate people that will be supported by the developing world’’ and that it was “incredibly relevant’’ that Banga was born in India. “They want to be able to appoint people who have experience and roots with other economies,’’ LeCompte said.

            “I can’t think of a more intense time for a person to be coming into this job,’’ said Clemence Landers, policy fellow at the Center for Global Development, a Washington think tank.

            The bank is under pressure to expand its mandate — an effort that likely would require the next president to convince donor countries to provide more money. 

            Critics say the bank should be doing more to help poor countries finance projects to combat and prepare for climate change without saddling them with heavy debt burdens. And Landers said it needs to do a better job at tackling problems that cross borders such as providing pandemic surveillance and backing broad vaccination programs.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819719,"On stand, Alex Murdaugh denies killings but admits lying","Disgraced South Carolina attorney Alex Murdaugh denied killing his wife and son but admitted lying to investigators about when he last saw them alive as he took the stand in his own defense Thursday.

            Murdaugh, 54, is charged with murder in the fatal shootings of his wife, Maggie, 52, and their 22-year-old son, Paul, who were killed near kennels on their property on June 7, 2021. In his testimony, Murdaugh continued to staunchly deny any role in the killings.

            “I would never intentionally do anything to hurt either one of them,” Murdaugh said, tears running down his cheeks.











            Prosecutors spent four weeks of the trial painting Murdaugh as a liar who stole money from clients and decided to kill his wife and son because he wanted sympathy to buy time to cover up his financial crimes that were about to be discovered. They have detailed what they called lie after lie, saying Murdaugh reacts violently when the truth is about to emerge, like trying to arrange his own death after his law firm fired him three months after the killings.

            Murdaugh lied about being at the kennels with his wife and son shortly before their killings for 20 months before taking the stand Thursday, day 23 of his trial. Murdaugh blamed the lie — first told to a state law enforcement agent hours after the killings — on his addiction to opioids, which he said clouded his thinking and created a distrust of police.

            “As my addiction evolved over time, I would get in these situations, these circumstances where I would get paranoid thinking,” Murdaugh said.

            The once-prominent attorney had told police that he was napping and did not go to the kennels before leaving the house to visit his ailing mother in another town. But several witnesses testified that they believed they heard Murdaugh’s voice along with his son and wife on cellphone video taken at the kennels about five minutes before the shootings. It took investigators more than a year to hack into Paul Murdaugh's iPhone and find the video.

            Once Alex Murdaugh started lying about being at the kennels, he said he felt he had to continue: “Oh, what a tangled web we weave. Once I told a lie — I told my family — I had to keep lying.”

            For prosecutors, that lie underpins a case where investigators haven’t presented the weapons used to kill the victims, a confession, surveillance video or clothes covered in blood. Murdaugh faces 30 years to life in prison if convicted

            Murdaugh testified that his wife asked him to go to the kennels the evening of the killings, so he rode down in a golf cart and wrestled a chicken away from a dog before returning to the house and deciding to go visit his ailing mother. 

            He said that, after returning home from visiting his mother, neither his wife nor his son was in the house. After several minutes, Murdaugh said, he drove his SUV to the kennels where he said he last saw them.

            Murdaugh described arriving to find the grisly scene of the killings, pausing his testimony for several seconds as he cried. “It was so bad,” he said.

            After his dramatic opening questions about whether Murdaugh killed his son and wife, defense attorney Jim Griffin led his client though several key points of the case.

            Murdaugh said he never saw a blue rain jacket that prosecutors found at his mother's home with gunshot residue on the lining. He said his mother's caretaker was mistaken when she said he came by unexpectedly at 6:30 a.m. acting oddly.

            He told Griffin several times that he urged investigators to get GPS data from his SUV or his wife's phone that would exonerate him. Earlier defense testimony suggested state agents waited too long to get that information from Maggie Murdaugh's device and it was overwritten for the night of the killings.

            Throughout his testimony, Murdaugh called his son “Paul Paul” and his wife “Mags,” though he didn’t use those nicknames in three interviews with police.

            Defense attorneys told the judge that Murdaugh might not have testified at all if prosecutors hadn't been allowed to introduce evidence of financial crimes.

            Murdaugh admitted in court that he stole money from clients and blamed an addiction to painkillers from the lingering effects of a college football injury that got worse nearly two decades ago.

            “I’m not quite sure how I let myself get where I got. I battled that addiction for so many years. I was spending so much money on pills,” Murdaugh said.

            Murdaugh is charged with about 100 other crimes, ranging from stealing from clients to tax evasion. He is being held without bail on those charges, so even if he is found not guilty of the killings, he will not walk out of court a free man. If convicted of most or all of those financial crimes, Murdaugh would likely spend decades in prison.

            Prosecutor Creighton Waters didn’t question Murdaugh about the murders at the start of his cross-examination, focusing instead on clients Murdaugh stole money from.

            “We heard about it in a very academic, paperwork manner. But in every one of these, you had to sit down and look somebody in the eye and convince them you were on their side when you were not,” Waters said.

            Murdaugh said he couldn't remember all the details of the thefts that took place over at least 13 years and offered a blanket statement that he was wrong, which Waters rejected before hammering on the personal nature of the thefts.

            “There were plenty of conversations where I looked people in the eye and lied to them,” Murdaugh eventually conceded.Disgraced South Carolina attorney Alex Murdaugh denied killing his wife and son but admitted lying to investigators about when he last saw them alive as he took the stand in his own defense Thursday.Murdaugh, 54, is charged with murder in the fatal shootings of his wife, Maggie, 52, and their 22-year-old son, Paul, who were killed near kennels on their property on June 7, 2021.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819726,German court convicts man over deadly 2014 attack in Syria,"BERLIN (AP) — A German court on Thursday convicted a Palestinian man from Syria of a war crime and murder for launching a grenade into a crowd of civilians waiting for food in Damascus in 2014. He was sentenced to life in prison.

            The 55-year-old, identified only as Moafak D. in line with German privacy rules, was arrested in 2021 in Berlin, where he had been living as a refugee. His trial opened in August.

            The German capital's district court found that the defendant on March 23, 2014, fired a grenade from an anti-tank weapon into the crowd in the Yarmouk district of Damascus, killing four people and seriously wounding two others.











            It said that he was the commander of a checkpoint for a Palestinian group, probably the Free Palestine Movement, and on the day in question also was supposed to be overseeing a distribution of food packages by the U.N. Relief and Works Agency, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees.

            The court said that part of the district was at the time controlled by militias loyal to President Bashar Assad’s government.

            The Yarmouk district, which grew out of a Palestinian refugee camp, was cordoned off by the Syrian government from July 2013 to April 2015, causing shortages of food, water and medical supplies.

            The court said the defendant acted out of revenge against civilians in the district after his 25-year-old nephew was killed two days earlier by shots fired by opponents of Assad's government.

            He was convicted of a particularly serious war crime, four counts of murder, two counts of attempted murder and bodily harm. The court also determined that he bears particularly severe guilt, meaning that he won't be eligible for release after 15 years as is usually the case in Germany.

            The verdict can be appealed.

            Germany’s application of the rule of “universal jurisdiction,” allowing the prosecution of serious crimes committed abroad, led last year to the first conviction of a senior Syrian official for crimes against humanity.

            Justice Minister Marco Buschmann on Thursday proposed reforms to the system. Those would include allowing victims of crimes against humanity and war crimes to join trials in Germany as co-plaintiffs, and providing for interpretation at trials for non-German speaking media.

            They also would see charges of crimes against humanity and war crimes encompassing “sexual slavery.”BERLIN (AP) — A German court on Thursday convicted a Palestinian man from Syria of a war crime and murder for launching a grenade into a crowd of civilians waiting for food in Damascus in 2014.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819741,"Yannik Paul shoots 7-under 65, leads Indian Open","NEW DELHI (AP) — Yannik Paul birdied his last four holes to shoot 7-under 65 and take a one-stroke lead after the first round of the Indian Open on the European tour on Thursday.

            The No. 119-ranked German's hot finish lifted him above Honey Baisoya, who was leading a contingent of Indian players making a fast start at DLF Golf and Country Club in New Delhi.

            Baisoya was in outright second place on 6 under while compatriots Angad Cheema and Shubhankar Sharma were tied for fourth place after shooting 68s.











            Three more Indian players — Manu Gandas, M Dharma and Yuvraj Sandhu — were also in the top 10 on 2 under, with Sandhu having one hole still to play in his first round.

            Paul, whose only win on the European tour came at the Mallorca Open last year, is playing for the sixth straight week and said he took it easy in the pre-tournament buildup. He didn't even play the back nine, choosing only to walk it — yet went on to birdie six of the nine holes coming in Thursday.

            “After a long stretch, you can just feel it here, feel it there,” Paul said. “I just played a nine-hole pro-am yesterday afternoon then walked the back nine on Tuesday, just to conserve as much energy as I could because I knew it would be challenging here, mentally as well as with the golf shots.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819742,Moldovan president in Romania to boost ties amid Ukraine war,"BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) — Romanian President Klaus Iohannis discussed energy, economic and security issues in Bucharest Thursday with his visiting Moldovan counterpart, as the two neighbors seek to boost ties amid Russia’s war in Ukraine.

            Iohannis' office said the talks with Moldovan President Maia Sandu would aim to bring her country closer to the 27-nation European Union, to which Romania belongs.

            Afterwards, Sandu said Moldova’s strategic partnership with NATO-member Romania is yielding “concrete benefits.”











            “Moldova is going through unprecedented challenges,” Sandu said, adding that over the past year, her country has faced “security challenges aimed at creating chaos and destabilizing our region.” Both countries border on Ukraine.

            Sandu’s visit came a week after she claimed Moscow was allegedly plotting to overthrow Moldova’s government, put the nation “at the disposal of Russia,” and derail its aspirations to join the EU. Russia strongly denied her claims.

            “Some wanted our country to fall. To be able to establish a puppet government in Chisinau, servile to the interests of the Kremlin,” Sandu insisted Thursday. “The Republic of Moldova remains ... determined on its way to the EU.”

            Over the past year, Moldova, a former Soviet republic of about 2.6 million people, has sought closer ties with its Western partners. Last June, it was granted EU candidate status, the same day as Ukraine.

            Since Russia invaded Ukraine a year ago, Moldova has faced a string of crises. These include severe energy problems after Moscow dramatically reduced gas supplies; rocketing inflation; several missiles that have traversed its skies from the fighting next door, and a huge inflow of war refugees.

            Iohannis vowed on Thursday to continue to support Moldova, saying it “is not alone in facing these challenges.”

            “I reiterate Romania’s firm condemnation of any Russian destabilization attempts,” he said. “Romania remains particularly vigilant towards Russia’s hybrid actions, which … are intensifying at the end of a year of war.”

            On Thursday, Russia’s Defense Ministry claimed without evidence that Ukraine is planning an “armed provocation” against Moldova’s Moscow-backed breakaway region of Transnistria. Russia maintains about 1,500 “peacekeeping” troops in the region, which is internationally recognized as part of Moldova.

            Moldovan authorities said they could not confirm the Russian assertion, but would inform the public “in case of any danger to the country.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819743,Workplace is the heart of thrilling series 'The Consultant',"NEW YORK (AP) — Think your boss is bad? The one in the new TV series “The Consultant” phones his workers in the middle of the night, nixes all remote work, fires people with long-term illnesses, invites himself to after-work staff drinks and clips his nails at his desk. He might also be a murderer.

            That's what awaits the nervous employees of the fictional Los Angeles-based gaming company CompWare every day as a new consultant steers the firm through tough economic times. The new boss is deeply weird and secretive, and likely to throw a gagged person into your car and tell you to just drive.

            “There is a sense of just being off balance the entire time. You never know what to expect,” says executive producer and pilot director Matt Shakman. ""You don’t know what to expect character-wise, story-wise, or even tone and style. And that’s what really drew me to this. This felt like a world and a show that I had never seen before or been a part of creating before. It feels wholly original.”











            Creator, showrunner and executive producer Tony Basgallop started the series by wanting to do a work-based thriller and someone recommended Bentley Little’s 2015 novel “The Consultant.” 

            Basgallop started adapting it just before the pandemic really hit and was left wondering if he was too late. Was anyone ever going back to work? Would anyone want to see a TV series about work terrors?

            “I was thinking, ‘This is crazy. I’ve actually taken on something that’s never going to get made.’ But then I just made the choice: You know what? When we go back — if we ever go back — it’s going to be worse than it was before,” Basgallop says. 

            “So I took very much the premise of the book — very much the feeling of this evil presence, lurking over everyone and no one knowing whether he’s the devil or just the boss from hell.”

            Starring Christoph Waltz as that boss, the Amazon Prime Video series which lands Friday also features Nat Wolff as a game developer, Aimee Carrero as the developer's fiancée and Brittany O’Grady as an aspiring executive. 

            The cast seems to have had a fine time despite the weirdness. “For making a show about such a toxic work environment, it was actually probably the most lovely work environment I’ve ever done,” said Wolff. 

            The series comes at a tumultuous time for the tech world, with thousands of job layoffs driven by the biggest names in tech like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Yahoo and Zoom.

            The workers at CompWare are feeling the strain, obligated to do as the boss demands no matter how inconvenient. The days of just jumping to another tech firm are gone, leaving a trapped and nervous employee base. 

            The series plays off the sense that work is not a safe place anymore. “If something goes wrong, you’re going to have to fix it. You’re going to have to compromise. You have to take the bullet, in a sense,” Basgallop says.

            It's up to the CompWare employees to determine what their boss is really up to and uncover his murky past. In many ways, he's a satire of a modern business leader who manipulates others and is quick to expose and manipulate weaknesses. One song that plays is Elvis’ “You’re the Devil in Disguise.”

            Part of the chill of the show has to do with Waltz, the Oscar-winner with memorable roles in films like “Inglourious Basterds” and “Django Unchained.” He is equally charming and menacing. 

            “There is a sense of humor about him that is unique. He is equally good at comedy and drama. There is no one better at fixing you with a stare and making you feel just uncomfortable,” says Shakman. 

            Waltz took a leap of faith on the show, having only been sent the script for the pilot and not knowing where the character would end up. But based on conversations with the creators, he dived in. “I considered it risky,” he said. “As an actor who actually lives in the moment, the prospective result almost becomes secondary.”

            The irony is that Waltz — whose last TV project was on the phone-based Quibi platform — is now playing a man who is leading a tech company, yet, the actor himself is anything but tech-savvy. 

            “In a Zoom situation, I'm usually the one who doesn’t find the connection, who doesn’t find the unmute button, who has the little lens covered — all of that,” he said, laughing. ""I’m not a digitally educated person.""

You’re going to have to compromise. You have to take the bullet, in a sense,” Basgallop says.It's up to the CompWare employees to determine what their boss is really up to and uncover his murky past. In many ways, he's a satire of a modern business leader who manipulates others and is quick to expose and manipulate weaknesses. One song that plays is Elvis’ “You’re the Devil in Disguise.”Part of the chill of the show has to do with Waltz, the Oscar-winner with memorable roles in films like “Inglourious Basterds” and “Django Unchained.” He is equally charming and menacing.“There is a sense of humor about him that is unique. He is equally good at comedy and drama. There is no one better at fixing you with a stare and making you feel just uncomfortable,” says Shakman.Waltz took a leap of faith on the show, having only been sent the script for the pilot and not knowing where the character would end up. But based on conversations with the creators, he dived in. “I considered it risky,” he said. “As an actor who actually lives in the moment, the prospective result almost becomes secondary.”The irony is that Waltz — whose last TV project was on the phone-based Quibi platform — is now playing a man who is leading a tech company, yet, the actor himself is anything but tech-savvy.“In a Zoom situation, I'm usually the one who doesn’t find the connection, who doesn’t find the unmute button, who has the little lens covered — all of that,” he said, laughing.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819744,FTX's Bankman-Fried faces new charges in updated indictment,"NEW YORK (AP) — FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried faced new fraud charges Thursday, as prosecutors accused him of cheating thousands of investors out of billions of dollars while casting himself as a trustworthy ”savior of the cryptocurrency industry"" — an image boosted by celebrity-studded Super Bowl advertising and big donations to political figures.

            New charges, including securities fraud and conspiracy fraud counts, were unveiled with the unsealing of the refreshed indictment in Manhattan federal court.

            In a statement, U.S. Attorney Damian Williams hinted, as he has several times previously, that prosecutors were not finished building their case.











             “We are hard at work and will remain so until justice is done,” he said.

            A spokesperson for Bankman-Fried's attorneys declined comment.

            The new charges raised the prison sentence Bankman-Fried could face if convicted from 115 years to 155 years, authorities said.

            It also boosted the number of counts in the indictment to 12, as prosecutors more thoroughly and eloquently told their story of what happened to FTX, Bankman-Fried's global cryptocurrency exchange, and its affiliated cryptocurrency trading hedge fund, Alameda Research.

            The description cast FTX customers, investors, financial institutions, lenders and the Federal Election Commission as victims of fraudulent schemes Bankman-Fried allegedly carried out from 2019 until last November.

            Prosecutors said Bankman-Fried stole billions of dollars in FTX customer deposits to support the operations and investments of FTX and Alameda and to fund speculative venture investments, make charitable donations and spend tens of millions of dollars on illegal campaign donations to Democrats and Republicans in an attempt to buy influence over cryptocurrency regulation in Washington.

            They said Bankman-Fried cast himself as a “figurehead of a trustworthy and law-abiding segment of the cryptocurrency industry” that sought to protect investors and clients.

            “As recently as late 2022, Bankman-Fried boasted about FTX’s profits and portrayed himself as a savior of the cryptocurrency industry, making venture investments and acquisitions purportedly to assist struggling industry participants,” the new indictment says.

            Meanwhile, he spent millions of dollars on celebrity advertisements during the 2022 Super Bowl that promoted FTX as the “safest and easiest way to buy and sell crypto” and “the most trusted way to buy and sell” digital assets, it states.

            In reality, prosecutors wrote, Bankman-Fried routinely tapped FTX customer assets to provide interest-free capital for his and Alameda's private expenditures and in the process “exposed FTX customers to massive, undisclosed risk.” They said Bankman-Fried controlled both companies and “used them to prop each other up, notwithstanding conflicts of interest and outright lies to the contrary.”

            It was not known when Bankman-Fried would return to Manhattan for an arraignment. Twice in the last two weeks, he has appeared in court after prosecutors expressed concern that he might be communicating online in ways they cannot trace. They have also said his communications indicate that he might be trying to influence a witness with incriminating evidence against him.

            
                A judge is deciding how to toughen Bankman-Fried's bail requirements to prevent any improper communications. Last week, he even suggested that Bankman-Fried might have to be incarcerated prior to trial if his communications cannot be monitored to ensure he is not tampering with witnesses.

            Bankman-Fried has already pleaded not guilty to charges that he cheated investors and looted customer deposits at FTX, his cryptocurrency platform. The charges accuse him of diverting money from his investors in part to finance political donations and make risky trades through his cryptocurrency trading hedge fund, Alameda Research.

            
                Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas in December and was brought to the United States soon afterward. FTX filed for bankruptcy on Nov. 11, when it ran out of money after the cryptocurrency equivalent of a bank run.

            He is free on a $250 million personal recognizance bond. The bail arrangement allows him to live with electronic monitoring at his parents' home in Palo Alto, California.NEW YORK (AP) — FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried faced new fraud charges Thursday, as prosecutors accused him of cheating thousands of investors out of billions of dollars while casting himself as a trustworthy ”savior of the cryptocurrency industry"" — an image boosted by celebrity-studded Super Bowl advertising and big donations to political figures.New charges, including securities fraud and conspiracy fraud counts, were unveiled with the unsealing of the refreshed indictment in Manhattan federal court.In a statement, U.S. Attorney Damian Williams hinted, as he has several times previously, that prosecutors were not finished building their case.“We are hard at work and will remain so until justice is done,” he said.A spokesperson for Bankman-Fried's attorneys declined comment.The new charges raised the prison sentence Bankman-Fried could face if convicted from 115 years to 155 years, authorities said.It also boosted the number of counts in the indictment to 12, as prosecutors more thoroughly and eloquently told their story of what happened to FTX, Bankman-Fried's global cryptocurrency exchange, and its affiliated cryptocurrency trading hedge fund, Alameda Research.The description cast FTX customers, investors, financial institutions, lenders and the Federal Election Commission as victims of fraudulent schemes Bankman-Fried allegedly carried out from 2019 until last November.Prosecutors said Bankman-Fried stole billions of dollars in FTX customer deposits to support the operations and investments of FTX and Alameda and to fund speculative venture investments, make charitable donations and spend tens of millions of dollars on illegal campaign donations to Democrats and Republicans in an attempt to buy influence over cryptocurrency regulation in Washington.They said Bankman-Fried cast himself as a “figurehead of a trustworthy and law-abiding segment of the cryptocurrency industry” that sought to protect investors and clients.“As recently as late 2022, Bankman-Fried boasted about FTX’s profits and portrayed himself as a savior of the cryptocurrency industry, making venture investments and acquisitions purportedly to assist struggling industry participants,” the new indictment says.Meanwhile, he spent millions of dollars on celebrity advertisements during the 2022 Super Bowl that promoted FTX as the “safest and easiest way to buy and sell crypto” and “the most trusted way to buy and sell” digital assets, it states.In reality, prosecutors wrote, Bankman-Fried routinely tapped FTX customer assets to provide interest-free capital for his and Alameda's private expenditures and in the process “exposed FTX customers to massive, undisclosed risk.” They said Bankman-Fried controlled both companies and “used them to prop each other up, notwithstanding conflicts of interest and outright lies to the contrary.”It was not known when Bankman-Fried would return to Manhattan for an arraignment.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819745,What will happen if medication abortion challenge succeeds?,"Medication abortions in the United States usually involve two different drugs.In the latest effort to limit abortion access, opponents of the procedure are seeking to ban one of those medications. If they succeed, only one of the pills would be available, but women would still be able to get abortions.Here’s a look at medications, efforts to curtail them and how clinics are responding.WHAT DRUGS ARE USED IN MEDICATION ABORTIONS?The Food and Drug Administration regimen for medication abortions involves two drugs, mifepristone and misoprostol. The drugs can be taken at home and are used in just over half of U.S. abortions.Mifepristone dilates the cervix and blocks the action of the hormone progesterone, which enables a pregnancy to continue. Misoprostol causes contractions that empty the uterus. Typically, mifepristone is taken by mouth first, followed by misoprostol a day or two later.Studies show medication abortions are safe and effective, though with a slightly lower success rate than ones done by procedure in a clinic.Mifepristone was developed in France in the 1980s as an abortion drug to be used with misoprostol. The FDA approved it in 2000. It’s indicated for use during the first trimester. It’s also approved in the U.S. to treat Cushing’s syndrome, a hormonal disorder.Misoprostol, which is made by several companies, is approved for treating gastric ulcers. It's sometimes used in miscarriages to help expel tissue, in addition to its use in abortions.In countries where mifepristone is banned for abortions, misoprostol alone is often used instead. Some U.S. clinics and telehealth providers also offer misoprostol-only abortions.In these instances, one four-tablet dose of misoprostol is typically recommended for very early abortions. Additional doses taken four hours apart are recommended for later abortions.Medication abortions are generally less expensive than procedures. At Carafem, a reproductive health group with clinics in four states and telehealth services in 16 states, medication abortions with both drugs cost $249 or $175 with misoprostol alone when obtained through a virtual visit. Abortion procedures at Carafem clinics cost about $450, a representative said.WHAT RESTRICTIONS HAVE BEEN PUT IN PLACE ON MEDICATION ABORTIONS?Since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June, several states have tightened restrictions on abortions. Some limits were imposed even before then. Abortions are banned or unavailable in more than a dozen states and more than a dozen others restrict access to medication abortion, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights.In November, an anti-abortion group filed a federal lawsuit in Texas seeking to ban mifepristone, claiming the FDA approved the drug 23 years ago without adequate evidence of safety. A federal judge appointed by former President Donald Trump heard arguments Wednesday on the lawsuit. If he sides with abortion opponents, access to mifepristone could be halted nationwide.WHAT WILL CLINICS DO IF MIFEPRISTONE IS BANNED?Clinics and telehealth providers already are preparing for a potential mifepristone ban by ordering more misoprostol supplies, so they can offer medication abortions with just that one drug. They’re also expecting a potential increase in demand for in-clinic procedures and are making sure they have enough staff members to handle the demand.“Our manufacturers reassure us that there is plenty of misoprostol. They’re aware of this potential dramatic increase in need,"" said Dr. Katie McHugh, an OB-GYN and abortion provider who works in Indiana, Ohio and Maryland.Clinics are also preparing for changes in how they counsel patients, who will need to be told that misoprostol-only abortions are slightly less effective and sometimes more painful than abortions done with both drugs.Abortions using both drugs “can be as effective as 98% or more,"" while misoprostol-only abortions are up to about 95% effective, said Melissa Grant, chief operating officer of Carafem. The reproductive health group already offers abortions with both drugs or misoprostol alone.“Hopefully we won't have supply issues,"" Grant said. “What worries me is potential interference with this drug, too.""WHAT'S IT LIKE TO HAVE AN ABORTION WITH ONLY MISOPROSTOL?Emma Hernandez, who works with the abortion rights group WeTestify, had an abortion eight years ago using both medications, and a second one more recently using just misoprostol. She was about eight weeks pregnant both times but said the experiences were pretty different.The first time she was living in Indiana and obtained the pills from a clinic, where she took the first pill and went home to take misoprostol.She took the four pills, holding them under her tongue for about half an hour, then went to sleep, only to be awakened by cramps stronger than she usually had with her period. The next day, the experience was complete and follow-up testing showed she was no longer pregnant.Now 29 and living far from an abortion clinic, she recently learned she was pregnant again. She decided on an abortion and was told a clinic in an adjoining state was her best option. Hernandez says she was too sick with pregnancy nausea to make the trip, but was able to buy abortion pills closer to home.She didn’t realize at first that the medication packet contained only misoprostol.She took three doses, three hours apart. The cramps were so intense she had trouble standing. There was little blood loss. And she eventually realized “it was not successful.""Within two weeks, her nausea and pregnancy fatigue returned. She bought abortion pills again, this time including mifepristone, and her next effort was a success.She knows her options could be more limited in the future.“We’ve seen our clinics taken away. We’ve seen our mifepristone at risk of being taken away. What are the limits?"" Hernandez asked. “It’s a tremendous loss.""___Follow AP Medical Writer Lindsey Tanner at @LindseyTanner.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819749,Browns hire Bubba Ventrone as new special teams coordinator,"CLEVELAND (AP) — Ray Ventrone made a name for himself as a special teams star for the Browns. 

            “Bubba,” as he's known, is coming back to Cleveland as a coach.

            Ventrone has been hired as an assistant head coach and special teams coordinator for the Browns. He'll replace Mike Priefer, who was fired earlier this week after four seasons filled with inconsistency by his units.











            Ventrone had been the special teams coordinator for Indianapolis since 2018. He interviewed after the season for the Colts’ head coaching job before the team hired Shane Steichen.

            The Browns are expected to announce Ventrone's hiring on Friday.

            The 40-year-old Ventrone interviewed with Cleveland coach Kevin Stefanski on Wednesday, as did New York Jets assistant special teams coach Leon Washington and New York Giants assistant coach Anthony Blevins.

            Ventrone will also have assistant head coach added to his title in Cleveland, meaning he would fill in for Stefanski if necessary. That happened to the Browns in the 2020 playoffs, when Stefanski contracted COVID-19 and Priefer led Cleveland to a wild-card playoff win at Pittsburgh.

            Ventrone will counted on to upgrade Cleveland's special teams, which rarely had a positive impact under Priefer. Ventrone played 56 games with the Browns from 2009-12 after playing two seasons with New England. He retired as a player following the 2014 season with San Francisco.

            Ventrone began his coaching career with the Patriots as special teams assistant coach from 2015-17.

            With the Colts, Ventrone's special teams were among the NFL's best, ranking in the top 10 in four of the past five seasons. Indianapolis averaged a league-best 27.8 yards per kickoff return this past season.

            Cleveland's special teams have often been the cause for losses the past few seasons. The Browns couldn't recover an onside kick in Week 2, when the Jets overcame a two-touchdown deficit in the final two minutes to win.

            Rookie kicker Cade York also struggled under Priefer's watch, and the Browns' return game rarely flipped the field.

            Stefanski has a few other openings on his staff and hopes to have them filled before leaving for next week's NFL Combine. Stefanski began the offseason by firing defensive coordinator Joe Woods and replacing him with former Philadelphia Eagles coach Jim Schwartz.

            Browns quarterbacks coach Drew Petzing left to be Arizona's offensive coordinator and defensive line coach Chris Kiffin took a job coaching Houston's linebackers. Also, Browns defensive backs coach Jeff Howard left to coach the Los Angeles Chargers’ inside linebackers.

            Stefanski is set to hire former Utah State defensive coordinator Ephraim Banda to coach Cleveland's safeties.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819750,Jill Biden's White House M&Ms a hit with giddy Namibian kids,"WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) — Jill Biden’s visit to Namibia was a big hit with scores of giddy children who crowded around her Thursday as she handed out boxes of White House M&Ms after visiting an organization that gets U.S. support for programs that teach young adults about HIV/AIDS and gender-based violence.

            “Candy from the White House,” Biden announced as she stepped out of her black SUV and approached the children, who had been waiting along the roadside.

            Biden quickly ran out of candy, and then another boy stepped forward. As he sadly turned away, Biden called out “Wait!,” and gave him the presidential tote bag that had contained the candy. 











            Jill Biden had spent nearly an hour at Hope Initiatives Southern Africa, where she listened to moving testimonials from participants in the nongovernmental organization's programs. Brave Illena, a 26-year-old mother, told Biden that the DREAMS program gave her the tools she needed to start her own cleaning business with 14 employees. She graduated from the program last year. 

            Another young woman, Adelaide Tembi Gowases, told the first lady that the program “has given me a voice.""

            Biden moved both women closer to the news media to share their testimonials and stood holding their hands. 

            “You're such a great role model,” she told Gowases, 22.

            A portion of the visit was moved inside when a torrential rain, preceded by booming thunderclaps, began to fall. Afterward, journalists who had been sent back to their vehicles were instructed by an aide to “get out of the vans, get out of the vans” and run up a hill to where the children had gathered alongside the road. 

            The first lady was then driven up the hill to the children. She and her granddaughter Naomi immediately started handing out red, white and blue M&Ms in boxes stamped with the presidential seal. Delighted with the sweets, the children quickly surrounded their American visitor.

            “Hold on, hold on. Wait your turn,” security officials told them. “Wait your turn.”

            The children live in Kilimanjaro, an informal settlement of makeshift homes built of metal on the outskirts of Katutura, a neighborhood near Windhoek, the capital of Namibia.

            Hope Initiatives Southern Africa works to end poverty and hunger in marginalized communities in the region. Some of its programs, including ones to prevent new HIV infections and gender-based violence, receive funding through the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. 

            The program, widely referred to by its acronym, PEPFAR, was founded in 2003 by President George W. Bush and is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year.

            The U.S. has invested over $100 billion in the global response to HIV/AIDS through PEPFAR, the largest commitment by any nation to address a single disease. More than 25 million lives have been saved worldwide, according to the U.S. State Department. 

            Biden praised PEPFAR while at Hope Initiatives.

            “Look how many lives it has saved and how many lives it will continue to save,” she said. “It's an amazing program.”

            She also heard from Peter Mayavero and Clopas Lazarus, who participate in Agents of Change, which teaches them about gender-based violence. Lazarus told Biden that he talks to his peers about such violence when they play soccer. 

            “So you lure them in with soccer, and then you teach them” she said.

            Patricia Sola and John Mafukidze, the married co-founders of Hope Initiatives, said afterward that they were honored by Biden's visit. Sola said she depends on small-dollar grants or short-term funding for programming, and is interested in securing more long-term funding. 

            Sola called it “the biggest honor in my 58 years to have Biden come and listen.""

            She said the visit gives her work a level of visibility the couple could never achieve on their own. 

            Before visiting Hope Initiatives, Biden said at a luncheon in her honor that the futures of the U.S. and Africa are “intertwined” and that African voices are critical to solving pressing world problems.

            Biden said that when she and President Biden were discussing her five-day visit to the continent, he told her how much Namibia’s struggle against apartheid inspired him to speak out when he was a U.S. senator. Namibia was once under the rule of South Africa, where the government operated under a now-abolished system of white minority rule.

            “He understood then, as he does now, that our futures are intertwined,” the first lady told the audience of about 200 Namibian government and other leaders at the State House.

            Namibian first lady Monica Geingos told Biden that her visit was a “powerful” sign of friendship for a country that “needs work.” Geingos added that “one of the reasons Namibia doesn’t make international headlines is because it’s a functioning democracy with the fundamentals in place.”

            Biden said she decided to visit Namibia — her first time there — after getting to know Geingos when she accompanied her husband, President Hage Geingob, to Washington for a U.S. summit with leaders from Africa.

            “You know, sometimes you meet someone and you instantly know that you will be friends,” Biden said, and described how their “conversation and laughter came so easily.”WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) — Jill Biden’s visit to Namibia was a big hit with scores of giddy children who crowded around her Thursday as she handed out boxes of White House M&Ms after visiting an organization that gets U.S. support for programs that teach young adults about HIV/AIDS and gender-based violence.“Candy from the White House,” Biden announced as she stepped out of her black SUV and approached the children, who had been waiting along the roadside.Biden quickly ran out of candy, and then another boy stepped forward.

Namibia was once under the rule of South Africa, where the government operated under a now-abolished system of white minority rule.“He understood then, as he does now, that our futures are intertwined,” the first lady told the audience of about 200 Namibian government and other leaders at the State House.Namibian first lady Monica Geingos told Biden that her visit was a “powerful” sign of friendship for a country that “needs work.” Geingos added that “one of the reasons Namibia doesn’t make international headlines is because it’s a functioning democracy with the fundamentals in place.”Biden said she decided to visit Namibia — her first time there — after getting to know Geingos when she accompanied her husband, President Hage Geingob, to Washington for a U.S. summit with leaders from Africa.“You know, sometimes you meet someone and you instantly know that you will be friends,” Biden said, and described how their “conversation and laughter came so easily.”",2023/02/24,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819752,Spanish police probe alleged match-fixing in Copa del Rey,"MADRID (AP) — Spanish authorities opened an investigation Thursday into possible match-fixing in a Copa del Rey game two years ago.

            The Spanish league said police are looking into the first-round match between Levante and Huracán Melilla, which Levante won 8-0.

            The league said it received an anonymous tip about the possible match-fixing.











            Six people connected to Huracán have been questioned. No one from Levante was involved in the alleged irregularities, the league said.

            Huracán said it will cooperate with authorities and punish anyone from the club if found guilty.

            Levante said in its statement that it had nothing to do with the allegations.

            Levante is a second-division club but was in the top league at the time. Huracán is currently in the fifth tier of Spanish soccer.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819753,Israel's rightward shift is straining its ties with US Jews,"An array of U.S. Jewish leaders are sounding alarms about what they see as a threat to Israel’s democracy posed by its new government, fearing it will erode the independence of its judiciary and legal protections for minority groups.

            While some Jewish leaders dismiss such fears are overblown, a solid majority of mainstream Jewish American groups are voicing unprecedented criticism of the Israeli government, raising fears about a growing rift between Israel and the predominately liberal American Jewish population. Some progressive voices have gone even further, saying Israel can never truly be a democracy as long as it rules over millions of Palestinians who do not have the right to vote. 

            The controversies come even amid a flare-up of deadly violence involving Israelis and Palestinians. On Wednesday, Israeli troops conducted a raid in the West Bank, triggering fighting that killed at least 11 Palestinians and wounded scores. 











            Likud party leader Benjamin Netanyahu took office as prime minister in December after the country’s fifth election in less than four years. His coalition allies include ultra-Orthodox parties and ultranationalist parties dominated by hardline West Bank settlers. 

            Critics are alarmed about coalition members' wish list of expanded settlements, narrowing the eligibility for would-be immigrants claiming Jewish heritage, and restricting non-Orthodox access to a sacred site. 

            They see a planned judicial overhaul as threatening the checks and balances on Israel's government — echoing concerns voiced by tens of thousands of Israeli street protesters in recent weeks. 

            “Here we are, about to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the Jewish democratic state of Israel that we love,” said Rabbi Rick Jacobs, president of the Union for Reform Judaism, a liberal denomination representing the largest U.S. Jewish religious population. Yet that anniversary is approaching amid fears for “the weakening of Israel’s democratic foundations,” Jacobs said.

            Rabbi Moshe Hauer, executive vice president of the Orthodox Union, an umbrella group for Orthodox Jews in the U.S., said Netanyahu's government and its political opposition share responsibility for the tensions. 

            “Is the government’s initial proposal extreme and in need of correction? Probably,"" Hauer said. But he said there's room for compromise.

            The Knesset, dominated by Netanyahu and his allies, voted this week for bills that would give the governing coalition control over judicial appointments — currently made by an independent committee that includes lawyers, politicians and judges — and curtail the Supreme Court’s ability to review the legality of major legislation. The Knesset also voted to empower lawmakers to overturn high court decisions by simple majorities.

            The bills require additional votes before becoming law.

            Representatives of the influential American Jewish Committee have urged Israeli government officials to consult with opposition leaders, judges and others, said Jason Isaacson, the AJC’s chief policy and political affairs officer.

            “If you’re going to fundamentally alter a system that’s been in place for a number of years and guarantees the independence of the judicial system … do it carefully, do it slowly,"" Isaacson said. 

            That said, “the sky is not falling,” Isaacson said, predicting Israel would retain a robust democracy.

            Opponents say the proposals would push Israel toward a system like Hungary and Poland, where the executive wields control over all major levers of power. Under Israel’s system, the prime minister already controls the legislature through his majority coalition.

            There could be widely acceptable changes to judicial selection, Jacobs said, but current proposals will “cause deep harm to the structure of the rule of law.”

            Attempts by Israel’s figurehead president to broker a compromise — efforts supported by many U.S. Jewish organizations — have failed to make headway. 

            A weakened court would particularly affect groups that have relied on judicial rulings for protections, including Palestinians, LGBTQ people and members of the more liberal Reform and Conservative streams of Judaism, whose ranks are small in Israel but comprise the majority of American Judaism. 

            The Jewish Federations of North America - which rarely comments on internal Israeli politics — opposed legislation that would give a simple Knesset majority power to override Supreme Court decisions. “The essence of democracy is both majority rule and protection of minority rights,” it said.

            Amichai Chikli, the diaspora affairs minister in Netanyahu’s government, pushed back against the criticism.

            “To say that we are changing the fundamental basis of the Israeli regime from a democracy to tyranny or dictatorship, this is complete nonsense,"" he told The Associated Press.

            Irving Lebovics, co-chair of Am Echad, supported changes in the judiciary, though he said specifics can be negotiated. Am Echad, a branch of Agudath Israel of America, communicates with the Israeli government on concerns of American Orthodox Jews, including haredi or strictly observant communities.

            The Supreme Court, he said, has too much power in deciding both the law and its own membership, he maintained. “The Supreme Court opines on whatever they choose to opine about,"" he said.

            Some cabinet members are also seeking to narrow eligibility under the Law of Return, which currently allows anyone with one Jewish grandparent to immigrate to Israel.

            There’s also talk of curbing the already limited space for egalitarian or mixed-gender prayer at Jerusalem’s Kotel, or Western Wall — the holiest place where Jews can pray, where most of the adjacent plaza is reserved for separate men’s and women’s sections as per Orthodox practice. 

            This has importance for visiting American Jews who want to pray at the wall in egalitarian worship.

            Supporters of the progressive group Women of the Wall — who pray monthly in the women’s section while using practices and vestments reserved to men in Orthodox Judaism — fear it will face new curbs. 

            In a show of solidarity, Reform rabbis from the U.S. and other countries joined the Women of the Wall at their monthly gathering on Wednesday, parading with Torah scrolls. 

            Orthodox protesters, including teenagers, heckled and harassed the group. 

            “I am bound by my personal values and by my Jewish values to support not only the Women of the Wall but to stand here and proudly hold the Torah for all the women who are told they cannot worship freely and openly at the Kotel,"" said Rabbi Hara Person, chief executive of the Central Conference of American Rabbis, the rabbinic arm of the Reform movement in the U.S.

             “Under the most oppressive government in Israel’s history, the rights and dignity of not only all Jewish women but of all inhabitants of Israel must be respected, supported, and protected,” she said.

            Chikli told the AP that it’s unlikely that an egalitarian prayer space at the Western Wall would be expanded under the current government.

            Jews in progressive circles say the major established organizations have failed to connect the debate over the legal overhaul with the fate of the Palestinians. They say that Israel cannot be a true democracy when its Palestinian citizens suffer from discrimination, and millions of Palestinians in the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza don’t have the right to vote in Israeli elections. 

            “The movement against Mr. Netanyahu is not like the pro-democracy opposition movements in Turkey, India or Brazil,” commentator Peter Beinart wrote recently in The New York Times. “It’s a movement to preserve the political system that existed before Mr. Netanyahu’s right-wing coalition took power, which was not, for Palestinians, a genuine liberal democracy in the first place.""

            Rabbi Angela Buchdahl, senior rabbi of Central Synagogue, a Reform congregation in New York City, said it’s unacceptable to have Israeli government leaders claiming to act in the name of Judaism while voicing “unabashedly racist” statements about Palestinians and expanding settlements with no effort at a peace agreement. 

            “We can’t feel comfortable sitting in the light of sovereignty next to a community living in darkness and expect to have peace,” Buchdahl said in a recent sermon. 

            She still finds hope for Israel’s democracy — not in its current government but in grassroots action. 

            She recently visited the Middle East as an advisory board member of the Partnership for Peace Fund. The U.S. initiative supports programs that bring together Jews and Palestinians in such areas as medical training and addressing climate change’s impact on the Jordan River watershed. 

            “That’s what we need to be investing in,"" she said. ""Working together in common cause.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819754,"March Madness: Top seed Purdue ousted, brackets in tatters","March Madness has truly begun! By the end of the first round, a trio of top seeds were already gone — No. 1 seed Purdue, No. 2 seed Arizona and No. 4 seed Virginia — and gone with them were millions of busted brackets.Here is what to know going into the weekend of the NCAA Tournament, including the favorites and underdogs as well as key games:TOP SEEDSThe top four seeds in the tournament were given to Alabama, Houston, Kansas and Purdue. Each had its share of headaches to set up what is already proving to be a chaotic tournament and the Boilermakers were the first to fall, ousted in a first-round stunner. Here is the latest from each region:EAST REGION: The Boilermakers got a No. 1 seed for the fourth time, but Purdue was dumped by Fairleigh Dickinson in a near-historic upset. The region appears to be wide open for the likes of No. 2 seed Marquette, Duke, Michigan State and more.SOUTH REGION: Alabama, led by coach Nate Oats in a challenging season, is a No. 1 seed for the first time behind SEC player of the year Brandon Miller, who has armed security on hand after being the subject of threats. The Crimson Tide opened the tourney with an easy win. Potential hurdles could include Baylor, Missouri and Creighton. Princeton or Furman, anyone?MIDWEST REGION:  Houston got a top seed and won its opener but All-American Marcus Sasser is hobbled by a groin injury. Potential hurdles could include No. 2 seed Texas, which advanced to face surprising Penn State.No. 3 seed Xavier held off Kennesaw State in its opener.WEST REGION: Kansas is the top seed in a stacked region and the Jayhawks faced a tantalizing second-round matchup against Arkansas. Kansas is without coach Bill Self, who is recovering from a heart procedure. No. 2 seed UCLA looked every bit a title contender in its opener, No. 3 Gonzaga advanced and a juicy 4-5 matchup pitted UConn against Saint Mary's in the second round.SHINING MOMENTSThe unforgettable moments are piling up already.Princeton used a late run to earn its first NCAA Tournament win in 25 years by ousting No. 2 seed Arizona. Furman celebrated its first tourney appearance since 1980 with a win over No. 4 seed Virginia on a deep 3-pointer by JP Pegues with 2.4 seconds left.Then came 16-seed Fairleigh Dickinson's win over Purdue as the 22 1/2-point underdog stifled 7-4 center Zach Edey to advance and join UMBC in the record books.At the player level, Texas A&M had no answer for the 3-point acumen of Penn State's Andrew Funk, who made 8 of 10 to help send the Aggies home. Kam Jones of Marquette had a stunning second-half scoring binge to lead the Golden Eagles to a win in their opener.GAMES TO WATCHNo. 4 Tennessee (24-10) vs. No. 5 Duke (27-8), Saturday, 2:40 p.m. ET (CBS)The Blue Devils have won 10 straight under first-year coach Jon Scheyer with Jeremy Roach matching his career-high with 23 points in each of his last two games.

The other Tigers ended a six-game tournament skid with their first win in the Big Dance since beating Clemson in the first round in 2010.No. 1 Houston (32-3) vs. No. 9 Auburn (21-12), Saturday, 7:10 p.m. ET (TBS)The top-seeded Cougars could be without star guard Marcus Sasser, an All-American who appreared to have reinjured a groin in the opening round against Northern Kentucky. Either way, the Cougars will have the find a way to slow Johni Broome, who was unstoppable in the Tigers' opening win.No. 2 Texas (27-8) vs. No. 10 Penn State (23-13), Saturday, 7:45 p.m. (CBS)The Longhorns will have to hope Andrew Funk falls into some kind of, well, funk, for the Nittany Lions. His barrage of 3s helped Penn State earn its first NCAA Tournament win in 22 years. Texas, under interim coach Rodney Terry, routed Colgate in the first round.GO DEEPERGun violence has cost lives and disrupted college sports all season, touching some of the top programs in college basketball, including Alabama. Coaches have been thrust into uncertain and unwelcome roles in trying to navigate the topic — as well as the fallout from the Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe vs. Wade.On a lighter note, if you feel you know March Madness pretty well, try this 25-question trivia quiz put together by AP.PLAYERS TO WATCHThe NCAA Tournament is filled with great players and the AP All-America team is a good place to get familiar with the names.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819761,Japan's restaurants fight back against 'sushi terrorism',"Takaya Takita is conflicted. As a father, he does not want the teenager who has caused outrage in Japan after his antics in a sushi bar — including licking his fingers and touching another customer's order — to blight his entire future. As the manager of a busy sushi restaurant, on the other hand, he insists something has to be done to stop other young people misbehaving to attract social media applause.That is precisely what the operator of the Sushiro chain of sushi restaurants is doing, with police in Gifu Prefecture putting together a case against the youth, who cannot be named for legal reasons.The incident first came to light in late January, when footage of the youth was posted on social media showing him touching another customer's plate of sushi as it passed his table in a ""kaiten-sushi"" restaurant, where plates of food pass by on a conveyer belt until they are selected. The footage, taken by a friend who is also facing charges, also showed the boy licking a soy sauce bottle and mugs for green tea ready to be used by other diners.The behavior was quickly described as ""sushi terrorism.""When the 48-second clip went viral on social media, Akindo Sushiro Co issued a statement saying it had taken thorough measures to clean the restaurant and would be introducing new hygiene rules, including requiring customers to collect condiments and chopsticks from a serving point before they sit down.In a press release, the company also pointed out that its shares had fallen 4.8% in the space of 10 days and that it would be taking legal action.The boy and his legal guardian have returned to apologize to the store and the company, but the firm says it has declined the apology as it intends to pursue damages through the courts.""It is the right thing to do,"" said Takita, who manages the Tetsu Ryubo sushi restaurant in the Honmoku district of Yokohama, south of Tokyo.""The footage showed the boy's face and lots of people will know who he is, so something like this is going to change his life for ever,"" he told DW. ""And that makes be a little worried for him. But at the same time, he is old enough to know that what he was doing was very wrong.""The operator of that restaurant is taking a stance,” he added. ""Similar problems have happened in the past and they and all other restaurants want to make sure this does not happen again. That is why it is important to go through the police and to make an example of him.""Other restaurants are following Sushiro's example and adopting zero tolerance policies towards anyone found interfering with their operations.Zensho Holdings Co, owner of the Japan-wide Hamasushi chain, has filed a similar complaint after footage was found online of someone adding large amounts of powerful ""wasabi"" to another customer's sushi before returning it to the conveyer belt. Other clips have emerged of a customer licking a spoon used to serve green tea powder.The problem is not confined to sushi restaurants, with yet another clip from a ""yaki-niku"" grilled meat restaurant showing a diner using a toothpick and then returning it to the holder on the table.Takita said his restaurant has had to introduce countermeasures, with chopsticks, soy sauce bottles and tea mugs now delivered to the table only after a diner has sat down.""We are lucky because we have loyal customers and we have been quick to change the way we do things to protect them,"" he said. ""We have not seen a decline in customers, but I know other restaurants have.""""And after all the problems caused by the coronavirus pandemic, the restaurant industry in general really did not need this problem.""Immediately after the incident was reported, there was an immediate backlash, with many Japanese saying they enjoyed eating out but no longer wanted to go to the sushi chains identified in media coverage. That attitude, however, appears to be changing.Takako Tomura was enjoying a sushi lunch with her family at Tetsu Ryubo on Sunday and said she wanted to show her support for a restaurant that she has visited countless times in the past.""I was shocked when I saw the footage,"" she said. ""Something like that can really damage a business and I wanted to show our support for our local sushi restaurant. They are doing some things differently now and I feel safe.""Tomura added that she ""cannot understand"" why the youth in the video footage had behaved in such as way.""For me, as a Japanese person, we have respect for other people around us,"" she said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819762,German far-right foundation to get state funding,"Political foundations in Germany are tasked with educating people on political matters at home and abroad — their activities include organizing events, conducting research, and issuing scholarships. They tend to be named after famous politicians: the center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU)-aligned foundation is named after Konrad Adenauer, the first German federal chancellor. The foundation linked to the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) is named after Friedrich Ebert, the first president of Germany's Weimar Republic in 1919. For the socialist Left Party, it is Rosa Luxemburg, co-founder of the German Communist Party (KPD). The Greens decided on Nobel Prize for Literature winner Heinrich Böll.Each year, these and other party-affiliated foundations receive a lot of money from the federal budget. It adds up to a contribution of well over half a billion euros. Only the Desiderius Erasmus Foundation (DES), aligned with the far-right Alternative for Germany party (AfD) and named after the northern Renaissance-era Dutch philosopher, remains empty-handed.But that must now change — because this week the Federal Constitutional Court has decided that a new law must be made to regulate the state financing of party-linked foundations. The court ruled that not considering the DES when allocating the so-called global grants for socio-political and democratic educational work interfered with the AfD's right to equal opportunities in political competition. ""A law passed by parliament is required in order to justify this interference: such a law is lacking here,"" the judgment read. So far, the federal parliament, the Bundestag, has decided on funding for party-affiliated organizations as part of budget negotiations.To date, foundations have received taxpayer money when the party they are aligned with was voted into the Bundestag for at least two consecutive elections. The AfD has met this requirement since it was re-elected to the federal parliament in 2021 with a solid 10% of the vote. The most recent organization to benefit from the requirement was the Left Party-aligned Rosa Luxemburg Foundation in the late 1990s.Now it is the turn of the AfD, a party that Germany's domestic intelligence service, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), suspects of being right-wing extremists.But there has long been resistance to this move. In the ""Manifesto for civil society and political education,"" people from a wide variety of organizations have joined forces: refugee rights group Pro Asyl, the Amadeu Antonio Foundation (which works to eliminate right-wing extremism), the Frankfurt-based Anne Frank Educational Center (Bildungsstätte Anne Frank), the Central Council of Jews in Germany, trade unions and churches.The metal trade union's Otto Brenner Foundation carried out a study in 2021 entitled ""Political education of the far right."" It comes to the conclusion that the DES could become a central building block for attempts by the far-right to achieve dominance in the pre-political space in Germany.""It is to be feared that with state funding in the tens of millions, DES could create permanent structures to place and anchor anti-human positions of the New Right more strongly in society.""The chairwoman of the Desiderius Erasmus Foundation, Erika Steinbach, has repeatedly rejected such allegations. She is a former president of the German Federation of Expellees (BdV) — which represents the interests of ethnic Germans who fled or were forced from their homes in central and Eastern Europe after the Second World War. During the oral hearing of the AfD lawsuit before the Federal Constitutional Court in October 2022, Steinbach spoke of an ""unjustified stigmatization.""Steinbach left the CDU in 2017 after 43 years of membership, in protest of the refugee policies of the Angela Merkel-led government. She then joined the AfD in 2022. She has said that there was no place in her DES foundation for ""radical, racist, and extremist ideas, no matter in what direction.""That is also the view of AfD co-chairman Tino Chrupalla. He sharply criticized the authors of the anti-far-right ""Manifesto for civil society and political education"" telling DW that they were interest groups ""who carry out political work with full-time employees and million-dollar budgets which mostly come from government funding.""With its motto ""Not a minute to lose in the fight against the right,"" the Initiative displayed its problematic understanding, according to Chrupalla: ""that an entire segment of the democratic spectrum, namely the so-called right-wing part, is being delegitimized in such an aggressive manner.""Antonios Souris takes a different view. The political scientist from Berlin's Free University outlined to DW the long-observed attempts by the so-called New Right ""to intellectually underpin their positions and steer the discourse in the direction they want it to go."" Journalistic investigations have revealed a network of New Right think tanks and publishers: ""Key organizations in this network are classified by the Office for the Protection of the Constitution as suspected or confirmed right-wing extremist.""Souris also expressed doubt about what the chairwoman of the DES has said. ""Erika Steinbach's credibility when it comes to clearly differentiating herself, as a member of the middle class-conservative camp, from the right-wing extremist end of the spectrum, has been drastically reduced by her statements, especially on Twitter.""To solve the problem according to their own preferences, the other parties in Germany's Bundestag parliament formulated a memorandum on financial grants to political foundations in 2022. According to this, only foundations ""who, according to their charters and overall activities, always guarantee that they are committed to the free and democratic basic order in the sense of the Basic Law and advocate for its observance."" Only the AfD believes that the DES can be relied on to comply with this.Following the verdict of the Federal Constitutional Court, the Bundestag must now finally pass a law to regulate how party-affiliated foundations receive public money.This article was originally written in German.",2023/02/23,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819764,Florida executes man for 1990 murder while a fugitive,"STARKE, Fla. (AP) — Florida executed a man on Thursday for murdering a woman in 1990 after he escaped from prison, stabbing her to death in a shopping mall parking lot in an attempted carjacking.

            Donald Dillbeck, 59, was pronounced dead at 6:13 p.m. after receiving a lethal injection at Florida State Prison, the governor’s office said. He had been convicted in the murder of Faye Vann, 44, in Tallahassee near the state Capitol.

            The execution was Florida’s first in nearly four years and the third under Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. By comparison, his immediate predecessor, current U.S. Republican Sen. Rick Scott, oversaw 28 executions. 











            Vann’s children, Tony and Laura, released a statement after the execution: “11,932 days ago, Donald Dillbeck brutally killed our Mother. We were robbed of years of memories with her, and it has been very painful ever since.” 

            They thanked DeSantis for carrying out the execution, saying it “has given us some closure.”

            The curtain between the death chamber and the viewing room opened at 6 p.m. Thursday. When asked if he had any last words, Dillbeck said: “I know I hurt people when I was young. I really messed up.” He also criticized DeSantis.

            The execution began at 6:02 p.m., and Dillbeck closed his eyes shortly thereafter. He breathed deeply for a few minutes while his body shook. By 6:07 p.m., his mouth hung open, and he appeared to stop breathing.

            Dillbeck was 15 when he stabbed a man in Indiana while trying to steal a CB radio, court records show. He fled to Florida, where Lee County Deputy Dwight Lynn Hall found him in a Fort Myers Beach parking lot. While Hall was searching him, Dillbeck hit the deputy in the groin and ran. Hall tackled him and, as the two wrestled, Dillbeck took Hall’s gun and shot him twice.

            Dillbeck was 11 years into a life sentence for killing the deputy when he walked away from a work release assignment catering a meal for a seniors event, according to court records. He then bought a paring knife and walked to Tallahassee.

            Vann was waiting for her family when Dillbeck approached her car with the knife and demanded a ride, saying he’d forgotten how to drive, court records show.

            Vann honked the horn, tried to drive off and fought back that Sunday afternoon, but Dillbeck stabbed her more than 20 times and slit her throat, court records show. He crashed the car a short time later and was captured after running from the scene.

            Despite a prior escape attempt and an assault on another prisoner, Dillbeck had been placed in a minimum security facility. A furious Republican Gov. Bob Martinez fired three corrections officials and sought to implement rules to ensure prisoners with life sentences would be held in more secure settings.

            Florida's Supreme Court earlier this month denied appeals claiming he shouldn’t be put to death because he suffers from fetal alcohol syndrome and it was cruel and unusual to keep him on death row for more than 30 years before his death warrant was signed. The U.S. Supreme Court denied his appeals Wednesday.

            DeSantis, who was reelected last November and who is considered a potential 2024 presidential candidate, was quiet on the death penalty during his first term. His office refused to answer repeated phone calls and emails about the lack of warrants signed since 2019. DeSantis also cut off an Associated Press reporter who asked about the long pause in executions and didn’t answer the question.

            But DeSantis criticized a Broward County jury’s failure to sentence Nikolas Cruz to death for fatally shooting 17 students and faculty at a Parkland high school, and has since said he wants to change a 2017 state law that requires a unanimous jury recommendation to impose the death penalty so that one or two jurors can’t affect the sentence.

            Since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976, Florida has been one of the most active states in carrying out executions.

            Democratic Gov. Bob Graham oversaw 16 executions between 1979 and 1987. Martinez oversaw nine in his one term in office, Democratic Gov. Lawton Chiles oversaw 18, and 21 prisoners were executed under Republican Gov. Jeb Bush. Gov. Charlie Crist oversaw five executions in his single term in office.STARKE, Fla.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819765,Reforms to Mexico electoral law spark fierce debate,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico’s elections chief slammed President Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s move to cut elections spending as an assault on democracy Thursday — criticism the leftist president dismisses as elitist. 

            López Obrador said Thursday he he'll sign the changes into law, even though he expects court challenges. The new law passed late Wednesday would cut funding for the country’s electoral agency and weaken oversight of campaign spending. The president has long said the agency is too expensive and that the money would be better spent on the poor. 

            The reforms have prompted fierce debate, and opponents already have announced lawsuits and protest marches in several cities. López Obrador already has taken to branding them as classist, racist defenders of corruption.











            “They are protesting because don’t want to help the poor,” López Obrador said earlier this week, accusing his opponents of being “racist” and “classist.”

            Lorenzo Cordova, the head of the elections agency, the National Electoral Institute, has said the reforms “seek to cut thousands of people who work every day to guarantee trustworthy elections, something that will of course pose a risk for future elections.” 

            The new law would cut salaries, funding for local election offices and training for citizens who operate and oversee polling stations. It would also reduce sanctions for candidates who fail to report campaign spending. 

            Cordova warned in a newspaper column published Thursday that the insults being hurled around the issue “aid and assist the authoritarian impulses that are floating around.”

            “The virulent discourse being used by some could wind up poisoning democracy itself,” Cordova wrote.

            Jaime Rivera, one of council members at the electoral institute, warned that as many as 4,000 employees could get the axe under the new funding cuts, something he said could cause “the collapse of the electoral organization.”

            López Obrador was nonchalant about court challenges to the election reforms saying Thursday that he believed they would be upheld because none of it was “outside the law.” 

            However, in the past he has frequently attacked Mexico’s judiciary and claimed judges are part of a conservative conspiracy against his administration.

            The president's strident pushback against the judiciary, as well as regulatory and oversight agencies, has raised fears among some that he is seeking to reinstitute the practices of the old Institutional Revolutionary Party, which bent the rules to retain Mexico's presidency for 70 years until its defeat in the 2000 elections. 

            Elections in Mexico are expensive by international standards, in part because almost all legal campaign financing is, by law, supplied by the government. The electoral institute also issues the secure voter ID cards that are the most commonly accepted form of identification in Mexico, and oversees balloting in the remote and often dangerous corners of the country. 

            Federico Estevez, a retired political science professor at the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico, said the opposition claims that López Obrador is “dismantling democracy” are exaggerated.

            “It’s not about undoing democracy, it’s a different conception of democracy,” Estevez said. “It’s more majoritarian, and less dependent on inadequate, unproductive and mistaken elites.”

            Patricio Morelos, a political scientist at the Monterrey Technological university, said the reforms could undermine confidence in elections.

            “Reducing costs could mean some savings in monetary terms, but that does not mean it would increase confidence in electoral processes or their legitimacy,” Morelos said. ""That should be the main goal, that people have confidence that their vote will count.”

            López Obrador remains highly popular in Mexico, with approval ratings of around 60%, but cannot run for re-election. Part of his popular appeal comes from railing against high-paid government bureaucrats, and he has been angered by the fact that some top electoral officials are paid more than the president. 

            His legislative initiative, known as “Plan B”, was proposed by the president in December after he did not obtain enough votes in Congress for even deeper electoral changes that would have changed the size and makeup of Congress.

            The president has repeatedly denied that the reform package could put the elections in Mexico at risk.

            López Obrador and his supporters have been critical of the electoral institute since 2006 when he came within 0.56% of the vote of winning the presidency and denounced his loss as fraudulent. He and his supporters launched a mass protest movement.

            “This is still driven by his grievances from from those years,” Estevez noted.

            López Obrador later won the presidency by a wide margin in 2018.

            Many in Mexico see the electoral institute as a key pillar of the country’s modern democracy since 2000.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819766,"Intense talks, familiar wrangles as UK, EU seek Brexit reset","LONDON (AP) — Senior U.K. and European Union officials met Thursday as part of what Britain called “intensive negotiations” to resolve a thorny post-Brexit trade dispute that has spawned a political crisis in Northern Ireland.

            Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris traveled to Brussels to meet Maroš Šefčovič, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator.

            Hopes of a breakthrough were raised last week when Prime Minister Rishi Sunak flew to Belfast to meet leaders of Northern Ireland’s political leaders and discuss progress. But hints of compromise by the U.K. government sparked opposition from hard-line euroskeptics in Sunak’s governing Conservative Party, costing the prime minister vital political momentum to secure a deal.











            The Democratic Unionist Party, Northern Ireland’s main British unionist force, also has warned it will oppose any deal that does not meet its demand for “significant, substantive change” to the Brexit treaty between the U.K. and the EU.

            “We are not just talking about tinkering around the edges,” DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson said Wednesday.

            Northern Ireland is the only part of the U.K. that shares a border with an EU member nation, the Republic of Ireland. When the U.K. left the bloc, the two sides agreed to keep the Irish border free of customs posts and other checks because an open border is a key pillar of Northern Ireland’s peace process.

            The fragility of that peace was underscored by the shooting of an off-duty senior Northern Ireland police officer on Wednesday as he coached children at soccer. Police said Irish Republican Army dissidents were suspected in the attack, which left the officer in critical condition.

            Under the agreement, there are checks on some goods entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the U.K. British unionist politicians argue that the new trade border undermines Northern Ireland’s place in the United Kingdom. The DUP walked out of Northern Ireland’s power-sharing government a year ago in protest and is refusing to return until the rules, known as the Northern Ireland Protocol, are redrawn.

            The protocol has become a huge political headache for the U.K. government and a thorn in the country’s relations with the EU. The two sides have bickered since the divorce became final in 2020, with Britain introducing a bill that would let it unilaterally rip up parts of the Brexit agreement, and the EU accusing the U.K. of failing to honor the legally binding treaty it had signed.

            The mood has improved since Sunak took office in October, replacing the more belligerent Liz Truss and, before her, Boris Johnson.

            But trying to fix the Brexit deal is a big gamble for Sunak. Pro-Brexit Conservatives brought down Prime Minister Theresa May in 2019 after repeatedly rejecting her attempts to forge a closer relationship with the EU, and they could hand Sunak the same fate if he pushes through an agreement without the Brexiteers’ support.

            The thorniest issue is the role of the European Court of Justice in resolving any disputes that arise over the rules. That role was agreed by Britain and the EU in the Brexit divorce deal, but the DUP and Conservative Brexiteers insist the European court must have no jurisdiction in U.K. matters.

            The U.K. hopes to resolve the dispute and restore Northern Ireland’s government before the 25th anniversary in April of Northern Ireland’s 1998 Good Friday peace accord. The British government hopes U.S. President Joe Biden will visit to mark the peace milestone.

            Sunak told lawmakers on Wednesday that “I have a good understanding of what is required and I will keep fighting until we get it.”

            But if he fails he could become another Conservative prime minister brought down by Brexit.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819769,What's a special grand jury and how does it work?,"ATLANTA (AP) — The foreperson of a special grand jury that investigated whether former President Donald Trump and his allies illegally interfered in the 2020 election in Georgia raised some eyebrows this week when she gave interviews about a process that is typically cloaked in secrecy.

            But a special grand jury is different from a regular grand jury, and it's an investigative tool that Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis chose to help evaluate the facts in the case.

            WHAT IS A SPECIAL GRAND JURY?











            A special grand jury, or special purpose grand jury, is impaneled specifically to investigate any alleged violation of the laws of the state of Georgia.

            HOW IS IT DIFFERENT FROM A REGULAR GRAND JURY?

            A regular grand jury in Georgia is seated for a limited duration, one term of court — in Fulton County that’s two months. Grand jurors hear everything from felony shoplifting to murder cases and then decide whether to issue an indictment.

            A special grand jury has no set term and focuses on a single topic. Unlike a regular grand jury, a special grand jury can subpoena the target of an investigation to appear before it, former Gwinnett County district attorney Danny Porter said. When the investigation is done, a special grand jury produces a report on its findings but can’t issue an indictment.

            WHY USE A SPECIAL GRAND JURY?

            Special grand juries are used for an expansive topic that takes longer than a single term of court to investigate and often has to do with public corruption, Prosecuting Attorneys’ Council of Georgia executive director Pete Skandalakis said.

            “It’s usually because it’s a very labor-intensive investigation that’s going to take a while to do,” he said, adding the investigation could involve calling witnesses, poring over documents and consulting experts.

            “The election case would be an ideal case for a special purpose grand jury,” Porter said.

            That’s because it’s likely a complex case with a lot of witnesses and potential logistical concerns that will take more time and focus than a regular grand jury is able to spend, he said.

            WHAT IS THE PROCESS?

            An elected public official in a county or a municipality within a county can ask the chief judge of the superior court in that county to impanel a special grand jury. It’s generally requested by a district attorney.

            After receiving the request, the chief judge submits it to the judges of the superior court for a vote. If a majority of the judges vote in favor, the special grand jury is seated. It is made up of between 16 and 23 people who are summoned from the county master jury list.

            A special grand jury can compel evidence and subpoena witnesses for questioning. It can inspect records, documents and correspondence of state or local government officials and their offices, and can require any person or company to produce records, documents or correspondence related to the subject it is investigating.

            When the special grand jury finished its investigation, it issued a final report of its findings and also recommended action. The judge has said the report includes ""a roster of who should (or should not) be indicted, and for what, in relation to the conduct (and aftermath) of the 2020 general election in Georgia.” But it’s up to the district attorney to decide whether to pursue an indictment. If the district attorney wants to seek an indictment, the case must be presented to a regular grand jury.

            ARE SPECIAL GRAND JURIES COMMON?

            No. Skandalakis said there have probably only been a handful of special grand juries used in the entire state of Georgia in recent decades and it’s “very uncommon” for a district attorney to ask that one be impaneled.

            WHAT DID THE FOREPERSON REVEAL ABOUT THE PROCESS?

            Emily Kohrs, a 30-year-old Fulton County resident, described some of what happened behind the closed doors of the jury room — including how some witnesses behaved, how prosecutors interacted with witnesses and how some witnesses invoked their rights not to answer certain questions.

            She told The Associated Press that prosecutors told the grand jurors they could read and watch the news but urged them to keep an open mind.

            The judge overseeing the special grand jury, Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney, told the grand jurors they could discuss what witnesses said and what is in the report but could not talk about deliberations.ATLANTA (AP) — The foreperson of a special grand jury that investigated whether former President Donald Trump and his allies illegally interfered in the 2020 election in Georgia raised some eyebrows this week when she gave interviews about a process that is typically cloaked in secrecy.But a special grand jury is different from a regular grand jury, and it's an investigative tool that Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis chose to help evaluate the facts in the case.WHAT IS A SPECIAL GRAND JURY?A special grand jury, or special purpose grand jury, is impaneled specifically to investigate any alleged violation of the laws of the state of Georgia.HOW IS IT DIFFERENT FROM A REGULAR GRAND JURY?A regular grand jury in Georgia is seated for a limited duration, one term of court — in Fulton County that’s two months.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819771,Average long-term US mortgage rate jumps to 6.5% this week,"The average long-term U.S. mortgage rate jumped this week to its highest level since November, more grim news for a housing market that's been in decline for a year.

            Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac reported Thursday that the average on the benchmark 30-year rate rose to 6.5% from 6.32% last week. The average rate a year ago was 3.89%.

            The average long-term rate reached a two-decade high of 7.08% in the fall as the Federal Reserve continued to raise its key lending rate in a bid to cool the economy and quash persistent, four-decade high inflation.











            At its first meeting of 2023 earlier this month, the Fed raised its benchmark lending rate by another 25 basis points, its eighth increase in less than a year. That pushed the central bank’s key rate to a range of 4.5% to 4.75%, its highest level in 15 years.

            Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted at the time that some measures of inflation have eased, but appeared to suggest that he foresees two additional quarter-point rate hikes this year. Minutes from that meeting released Wednesday mostly corroborated that view, but a series of strong economic reports in recent weeks has some analysts forecasting more than two rate increases this year, to a range of 5.25% to 5.5%.

            While the Fed's rate hikes do impact borrowing rates across the board for businesses and families, rates on 30-year mortgages usually track the moves in the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide to pricing loans. Investors’ expectations for future inflation, global demand for U.S. Treasurys and what the Federal Reserve does with interest rates can also influence the cost of borrowing for a home.

            The big rise in mortgage rates during the past year has battered the housing market, with sales of existing homes falling for 12 straight months to the slowest pace in more than a dozen years. January’s sales cratered by nearly 37% from a year earlier, the National Association of Realtors reported on Tuesday. 

            For all of 2022, NAR reported last month that existing U.S. home sales fell 17.8% from 2021, the weakest year for home sales since 2014 and the biggest annual decline since the housing crisis began in 2008.

            Higher rates can add hundreds of a dollars a month in costs for homebuyers, on top of already high home prices.

            The rate for a 15-year mortgage, popular with those refinancing their homes, climbed this week to 5.76% from 5.51% last week.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819773,"MLB's bigger bases could lead to more steals, fewer injuries","PEORIA, Ariz. (AP) — Like a violin virtuoso using a new music stand, San Diego Padres third baseman Manny Machado noticed a difference right away.

            Not only are the bases bigger, but they feel different, too.

            ""It’s definitely different, for sure,” said Machado, a two-time Gold Glove winner. ""They look better. I just got to kind of keep playing with it and stepping on it and kind of like getting the feel for it. But it’s definitely different for sure.”











            The bigger bases — going from 15- to 18-inch squares — are part of a flurry of changes by Major League Baseball designed to put more action and athleticism back in the game and make it more appealing to a younger generation of potential fans.

            When the new rules were adopted by baseball's 11-person competition committee in September, the four players on the panel supported the bigger bases and voted against the use of a pitch clock and limits on defensive shifts.

            The new bases — “They look like a pizza box,” Red Sox manager Alex Cora cracked — cut down the distance between the bases by 4 1/2 inches. The distance between third and home and home and first was trimmed by 3 inches.

            It doesn't sound like much, but the impact could be considerable.

            Instead of waiting around for a three-run homer, big league teams could try a more aggressive approach on the basepaths. Coupled with new limits on what MLB calls disengagements — pickoff attempts or steps off the rubber — it's more important than ever that pitchers are quick to the plate and strong-armed catchers stay alert with runners on.

            “The run game, preventing the run game, is something that we've talked about, we're going to continue to talk about, because ... the stolen-base attempt should increase a good bit, I think,” Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said.

            Major league teams finished with 2,486 steals in 3,297 attempts last year, up from 2,214 steals and 2,926 attempts in 2021, according to Sportradar, but much lower than 3,229 steals and 4,365 attempts a decade ago in 2012.

            In testing in the minors, two Triple-A leagues used the bigger bases for half of the 2021 season. One experienced a 2.2% increase in successful steals, and the other posted 0.7% increase.

            The 2012 season — when Mike Trout led the majors with 49 stolen bases — was the last time the big leagues surpassed 3,000 steals and 4,000 attempts.

            “I've definitely been thrown out by less than (4 1/2) inches ... so maybe that starts factoring into results,” said Chicago Cubs second baseman Nico Hoerner, who swiped a career-best 20 bases in 22 attempts last year.

            Of course, it also gives the majors' top defensive first basemen an even better chance of keeping runners off base altogether.

            “I think it could help. It’ll give me another inch or so of reach on a throw that wants to pull me off the base,” said Arizona Diamondbacks first baseman Christian Walker, who won his first Gold Glove last year.

            Besides the activity on the basepaths, Major League Baseball is hoping the change will help reduce injuries. While testing the bigger bases in the minors, there was a 13% decline in what the league calls “injury events near the bases” from 2021 to 2022.

            There's more room for first basemen to avoid getting stepped on, or to pull their arm away in time to avoid a batter hustling up the line. It also should help avoid collisions all over the diamond.

            “When you walk on the field, you don't really notice it, and getting closer to the bag, you definitely do notice it,” said Cubs first baseman Eric Hosmer, a four-time Gold Glove winner. ""It seems like a little flatter, too, as well. Not only bigger and longer, but definitely a little flatter.

            “But yeah, I think it's going to prevent some injuries, so I think anytime you can even knock that number down one or two guys, that's well worth it.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819774,Insurer Humana lays out employer-sponsored coverage exit,"The health insurer Humana will stop providing employer-sponsored commercial coverage as it focuses on bigger parts of its business, like Medicare Advantage.

            The insurer said Thursday it will leave the business over the next 18 to 24 months. It includes medical coverage provided through private companies and for federal government employees.

            Human will still provide insurance through its military service business. It covers active duty service members, their families and retirees and totals nearly 6 million people. It also will still provide employer-sponsored specialty coverage like vision and dental benefits.











            Employer-sponsored health insurance is one of the more common ways for Americans to get coverage. But at nearly a million people, it amounts to a small part of Humana’s enrollment of more than 13 million.

             Humana's business largely centers on the military and Medicare Advantage plans. Those are privately run versions of the federal government’s Medicare program for people age 65 and older.

            Humana also runs Medicaid coverage in several states. 

            CEO Bruce Broussard said in a prepared statement that the exit from employer-sponsored coverage lets Humana focus on its “greatest opportunities for growth.”

            The company also said its employer-sponsored business “was no longer positioned to sustainably meet the needs of commercial members over the long term or support the company’s long-term strategic plans.”

            Employer-sponsored enrollment growth has largely slowed for insurers, including market leaders like UnitedHealthcare. Companies have turned more to government-backed coverage like Medicare Advantage or Medicaid for growth. 

            They also have pushed deeper into managing prescription drug plans and providing care in order to control health care costs. 

            Humana does not expect the change to affect adjusted profit this year, which the company projects to be at least $28 per share. 

            Analysts forecast $28.06 per share, according to FactSet.

Companies have turned more to government-backed coverage like Medicare Advantage or Medicaid for growth.They also have pushed deeper into managing prescription drug plans and providing care in order to control health care costs.Humana does not expect the change to affect adjusted profit this year, which the company projects to be at least $28 per share.Analysts forecast $28.06 per share, according to FactSet.Shares of Humana Inc., based in Louisville, Kentucky, climbed more than $4 to $507.91 Thursday.",2023/02/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819775,"For donors, wartime Ukraine aid creates blurry ethical line","NEW YORK (AP) — Bulletproof vests and drones. Pickup trucks, walkie-talkies and tourniquets. These are just some of the items that individuals and nonprofits have donated to buy and ship to Ukraine, where sometimes they are then used by those fighting Russia's invasion. 

            “We’ve had these discussions countless times,” said Igor Markov, a director of the nonprofit Nova Ukraine, about where to draw the line between what aid is humanitarian versus that which supports the active defense — the fighting — in his home country. 

            His Stanford, California-based organization, which delivered some $59 million in aid to Ukraine since Russia invaded a year ago, decided ultimately not to support volunteer fighters. 











            “We realized there’s a significant amount of money that would be ruled out,” he said, pointing to platforms that facilitate matching employee donations, like Benevity, and some companies, like Google, that require nonprofits to promise their aid does not support active fighting as a condition of receiving contributions.

            Throughout the past year, U.S. and European companies, individuals and organizations have navigated local and international regulations to provide aid and grappled with similar moral questions about whether or not to donate to an allied nation’s defense. 

            Markov said he contributed to buying equipment for Ukraine's frontline defenders as an individual. And he points out that items like drones and pickup trucks may not usually be considered military equipment before asking, “Guess how they’re used?” 

            “It could be used to just carry food. It could be used to carry munitions,” he said of the vehicles, adding that Ukrainian fighters have been creative in using whatever equipment they have. Drones, meanwhile, have become an essential tool in the fighting.

            Under U.S. laws, nonprofits are not allowed to donate to people in combat, said New York attorney, Daniel Kurtz, a partner at Pryor Cashman.

            “You can’t support war fighting, can’t support killing people, even if it’s killing the bad guys,"" he said. ""It’s not consistent with the law of charity.”

            But Kurtz doubts the IRS will examine donations to Ukraine — in part for reasons of capacity, but also because of the political support for Ukraine's government. 

            “While I’m sure some of them are carefully lawyered, there’s enormous pressure to provide this support,” he said of nonprofits. “So my guess is probably a lot of people are just going ahead and doing it.” 

            The reality, as described by some nonprofit leaders, is that everyone in Ukraine is fighting to defend the country, from children to an 80-year-old Holocaust survivor. 

            “We’re open,"" said Dora Chomiak, president of Razom for Ukraine, a New York nonprofit that has seen the contributions it receives jump from around $200,000 a year to at least $75 million in 2022. ""Our aid and our medical equipment and our communications equipment are going to people who are defending the country.”

            Though it has delivered more than a thousand drones, her organization ruled out fundraising for military equipment because it did not fit into the organization’s charitable mission, said Chomiak. Getting the necessary licenses would also have delayed immediately impactful actions, such as delivering tens of thousands of specialized first aid kits to the frontlines.

            Companies, which have given some of the largest publicly known donations to Ukraine, must also consider to what extent their donations are directly supporting Ukraine's war effort. Microsoft Corp. has donated at least $430 million in services and cash in 2022, not including cybersecurity services. 

            Tom Burt, a Microsoft vice president, said he set up direct, encrypted communication channels with senior cybersecurity officials in Ukraine before the war began and continues to communicate with them regularly. At the start of the war, Microsoft helped move the Ukrainian government’s digital infrastructure from physical servers in the country into the cloud. The company also helps protect Ukrainian devices and software from Russian cyber intrusions and attacks that are often coordinated with physical military campaigns. 

            “It’s possible, of course, that some of those devices are being used by the military or by logistics organizations, both government and private sector, to provide both humanitarian aid and military supplies and equipment,” Burt told The Associated Press. “That’s not really our role to get engaged in that.” 

            While supporting the Ukrainian government, Microsoft has learned a great deal about malware used by Russian-aligned groups.

            “That’s helping us build even more secure products and services,” Burt said. “But the fundamental reason that we’re doing this is because we think it’s the right thing to do.”

            Microsoft has agreed to provide its services at no cost to Ukraine through 2023. But it's possible Ukraine will turn into a paying customer when the war ends. 

            Dana Brakman Reiser, a professor at Brooklyn Law School who co-wrote a recent book about corporate giving, said many companies use philanthropic activity for business development, to market their brand or motivate their employees. 

            “They’re saying, ‘This is philanthropic.’ And that’s a very subjective assessment. It may be largely philanthropic,"" she said. ""It may have some business development and benefit for the company, especially in a very long-term sense.”

            Americans have previously fundraised or even fought in conflicts in which the U.S. government was not a party, said Andrew Morris, who teaches history at Union College. Before the U.S. entered World War II, Japanese-Americans were among several immigrant groups who sent aid back to their countries of origin, including packages directly to Japanese soldiers. 

            “It’s not guns, but it’s going directly to the military,"" he said. ""Is that a distinction without a difference?”

            The U.S. government eventually saw such relief efforts as evidence of Japanese disloyalty when they interred whole communities after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. But, it tolerated the work of another group that shipped weapons to Britain's home guard, who were ill-equipped, despite the U.S. being formally neutral at the time, Morris said. 

            “I think that makes it a lot easier for this private sector, voluntary donations to flow in the direction that U.S. foreign policy is,” he said, though generally, the government discourages individuals from pursuing their own foreign policy objectives. 

            Greg Schneider, executive vice president of The Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, which supports around 10,000 Holocaust survivors in Ukraine, many of whom are now in their eighties and nineties, said it carefully tracks the food, water and medicine it has sent into the country since the war. 

            “Most of the funding comes from the German government through us,” he said. “So, it’s very clear to us that it doesn’t cross over into any non-humanitarian efforts.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819776,"Amid crackdown on dissent, Tunisian leader turns on migrants","TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) — Tunisian authorities on Thursday said they have arrested dozens of migrants near the Algerian border, two days after Tunisia's increasingly authoritarian leader claimed there's a plot to erase his country's identity by bringing in sub-Saharan Africans.

            President Kais Saied said Tuesday that “urgent measures” were needed to address the entry of irregular immigrants from sub-Saharan countries, “with their lot of violence, crimes and unacceptable practices.”

            He ordered a rapid response via “diplomatic, security, military fronts” and strict application of the law on foreigners.











            Saied's comments at a National Security Council meeting raised a storm on social media and condemnations from nongovernmental organizations. Tunisia, once lauded as the only budding democracy in the Arab world, has recently also seen a crackdown on opposition politicians and activists.

            In a statement Thursday, the Tunisia-Africa Business Council denounced “racist practices ... spreading panic among sub-Saharan students in Tunisian universities.” It said a “strong message” should be sent to reassure African students, and “clear instructions given to security forces to ensure security ... including the rights of foreigners.”

            Also Thursday, authorities in Kasserine, near Tunisia’s western border with Algeria, said security forces have arrested 69 migrants of various nationalities in the past 48 hours for illegal entry. 

            There are no official data on the number of sub-Saharan migrants in Tunisia, but a 2021 count estimated them at 21,000. Migrants mainly enter from Algeria and Libya, and usually want to continue their journey to Europe.

            Presidential aide Walid Hajjem said Wednesday that planned measures for sub-Saharan migrants will not breach their human rights or hurt relations with African countries.

            “Tunisia is not against the presence ... of foreigners of sub-Saharan nationalities,” he told Attessia TV, adding that students, tourists and others “are welcome” but must respect the law. 

            Even before Saied’s comments on immigration, he had provoked concern with a crackdown on dissent.

            People arrested included the head of Radio Mosaique FM, Noureddine Bouttar, earlier this month, followed last weekend by the expulsion of Esther Lynch, head of the European Trade Union Confederation, who was accused of interfering “with Tunisian internal affairs” after addressing a protest rally against the president.

            On Wednesday, police arrested the head of the Republican Party, Issam Chebbi, and activist Chaima Issa.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819777,"Democrat Tony Earl, former Wisconsin governor, dies at 86","MADISON, Wis. (AP) — Tony Earl, a Democrat who served one term as Wisconsin's governor in the 1980s and later bemoaned the increasing partisanship in politics, has died. He was 86.

            Earl, a champion of gay rights and a staunch environmentalist, died on Thursday “peacefully surrounded by family,” his daughter Julia Earl texted The Associated Press. Earl had been hospitalized after suffering a stroke earlier this week. 

            “A formidable leader and public servant, trusted colleague and mentor, and a good and loyal friend, Tony was well-liked and respected by so many,"" Gov. Tony Evers said in reaction to his death.











            Earl served only one term as governor, from 1983 to 1987, before being beaten by Republican Tommy Thompson who labeled him as ""Tony the Taxer"" because of tax hikes Earl signed in the opening months of his term. Thompson and Earl were friends for decades, despite their political rivalry.

            “We both ran for Governor in 1986, but we didn’t run against each other,"" Thompson said in a statement. “We often joked that I thought he should have been a Republican and he was sure I should have been a Democrat. What we both were was Wisconsinites first and foremost.”

            Earl's political career ended after he lost a Democratic primary race for U.S. Senate in 1988 to Herb Kohl, but he went on to become a leading advocate for campaign and election finance reforms and a champion of environmental causes.

            “He never lost his ability to be good and nice and was never pompous,” said Jay Heck, the head of lobbying group Common Cause Wisconsin and a personal friend of Earl's for decades. “That may have been one of his political failings. He was never mean enough to go after people others thought he should go after. ... He was beloved by most Democrats and got along very well with Republicans.”

            Democratic U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan said he volunteered on Earl's first campaign for governor when he was in high school.

            “From the first day I met him, he was always the most gracious person, with the goal of cultivating a Democratic bench for the future,"" Pocan said in a statement Thursday. “Politics was never personal to him, and I’ve taken that lesson to heart.”

            The sour economy proved to be tough for Earl to overcome during his time as governor. The unemployment rate was 12% when he took office. And the $1 billion budget deficit led to Earl's pushing a tax increase through the Legislature, a move that hung over his tenure and ultimately fueled his defeat in 1986 by Thompson.

            “From Day One, I was ‘Tony the Taxer,’” Earl told The Associated Press in 2013.

            Earl attempted a comeback two years after losing reelection, running as a progressive Democrat for the U.S. Senate. One of his campaign slogans was, ""What this nation needs is more Peace Corps and less Star Wars,"" referring to the Republican-backed missile defense system proposed at the time.

            But Earl's campaign got cut off at the knees when Kohl, fresh off of purchasing the Milwaukee Bucks, joined the race late and poured more than $7 million of his own money into winning the Democratic primary and eventually the general election.

            Earl never ran for office again. Instead, he set up shop in Madison as an attorney and became an outspoken advocate for good governance reforms. In 1996, he reorganized Common Cause of Wisconsin, a group that argues for campaign finance and election reforms, and he also later served as a board member of the Joyce Foundation, a charitable organization focusing on the Great Lakes region.

            For more than three decades, including his four years as governor, the silver-bearded Earl frequented the Madison restaurant Avenue Bar, located just down the street from the Capitol. There he was known to enjoy a pint or two of LaBatt beer as he talked politics with reporters, former and current politicians, old friends and neighborhood residents who stopped in for the popular Friday fish fry.

            Earl, in August 2013 at the Avenue, said he had no regrets about his time in office.

            “Somebody told me when I was elected, ‘You’re about to embark on a mountaintop experience.’ And it really was in many, many ways,” Earl said. “I loved the retail politics. I loved to get around the state. I enjoyed all these little festivals.”

            Earl said he believed his legacy would be his advocacy for gay rights. He established, by executive order, a process for gay people to bring discrimination complaints, created a Governor’s Council on Gay and Lesbian Issues and appointed an openly gay man as his press secretary. Tammy Baldwin, who went on to become the first openly gay person ever elected to the U.S. Senate, interned in Earl's office.

            Earl also appointed the state's first female Department of Administration secretary, Doris Hanson, and the first Black Cabinet member, Howard Fuller, as head of the Department of Employee Relations.

            “Now the kinds of things I was doing are absolutely taken as a given,” Earl told AP a decade ago.

            Earl also said he believed his work on the environment, in particular joining with other Midwest governors to create the Council of Great Lakes Governors in 1983, will be a part of his lasting legacy.

            Earl was born and raised in Michigan. He graduated from Michigan State University and received his law degree from the University of Chicago law school in 1961. He practiced law in the U.S. Navy from 1961 to 1965, and he was appointed assistant district attorney in Marathon County in 1965.

            He worked three years as city attorney in Wausau before running for the state Assembly in 1969. He served until 1974, including four years as Democratic majority leader.

            Earl ran for attorney general in 1974 but lost in the primary. He worked a year as secretary of the Department of Administration, and five years as Department of Natural Resources secretary, before running for governor in 1982.

            Earl's candidacy was seen as a long shot, given that he was poised to face popular Republican incumbent Gov. Lee Dreyfus. But Dreyfus decided against seeking reelection after Earl had begun his campaign, clearing Earl’s path to a 15-point victory over Republican Terry Kohler.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819778,List: Some of the largest private donations to Ukraine,"NEW YORK (AP) — Some of the largest private donations in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine a year ago have come from American technology companies and European foundations or companies with a social mission. But millions of individuals have also given directly to nonprofits or humanitarian agencies with some of their donations amplified by employer or donor matches. 

            Another measure of support of Ukraine and Ukrainians can be seen in the astronomical growth of U.S.-based nonprofits like Nova Ukraine and Razom for Ukraine, both of which were founded in 2014 after Russia first invaded Crimea. They went from receiving hundreds of thousands of dollars in contributions annually to each raising more than $70 million in cash and in-kind donations since February 2022. 

            The nonprofit Candid tracks donations to causes related to the war in Ukraine and compiled information on more than $1.2 billion in gifts from the private sector and individuals from around the world. With long delays in the public reporting of donations in the U.S., Candid says this ""patchy, incomplete and messy"" data is the best currently available.











            The private sector aid is a small portion of the overall global response, with the U.S. Congress allocating $113 billion in aid to Ukraine so far. The U.N. has received $3.4 billion in commitments or donations mostly from governments to fund its humanitarian response to the war. 

            Here are some of the largest publicly-known private donations to support Ukraine and Ukrainians in the past year.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819779,Maryland mulls ending child sexual abuse lawsuit time limits,"ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) — Adults who testified they were sexually abused as children urged Maryland lawmakers on Thursday to end the state's statute of limitations for when civil lawsuits can be filed against institutions related to child sexual abuse.

            Dr. Frank Schindler, who testified he was sexually abused by a Catholic priest when he was a 5-year-old kindergartner in 1954, told legislators that the measure was “both a moral and a civil rights issue.” 

            “It will send a strong message to all survivors and their abusers that the gross violation of the basic right of children not to be abused will no longer be tolerated in Maryland no matter how powerful the source of that abuse,"" said Schindler, who is now 73-year-old psychologist and a member of Maryland's chapter of Survivors Network for those Abused by Priests. 











            Carolyn Surrick, who has testified about abuse she experienced at age 13 from two teachers at the Key School in Annapolis in the 1970s, told lawmakers at the hearing it wasn't up to them to decide who should be held accountable.

            “You just need to make it possible for us to have our day in court,” Surrick said. 

            Currently, people in Maryland who say they were sexually abused as children can't sue once they reach the age of 38. The Maryland House has approved legislation in recent years that would have lifted that age limit, but it stalled in the state Senate.

            This year, state Sen. Will Smith, who chairs the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, is sponsoring a bill that would end the age limit. He said in an interview that he's confident the bill will pass this year but that the courts likely will have the final say.

            “I’ve worked with the advocates since the summer, and I feel confident that we’ll produce a good product, but not absent some serious questions and some serious concerns,” Smith, a Democrat, said. ""A lot of what will be the final outcome is going to be determined by the courts. I suspect that it will be challenged, if and when we pass the bill.” 

            Kathryn Robb, the executive director of Child USAdvocacy, a nonprofit that advocates for better laws to protect children, testified that 15 states have lifted statutes of limitations for child sexual abuse. Twenty-four have approved revival periods known as “lookback windows,” which are limited time frames during which accusers can sue, regardless of how long ago the alleged abuse occurred, Robb said.

            The measure would include caps for damages. For example, up to $1.5 million could be awarded to a person for injuries arising from a single incident at a private or non-profit entity. The limit would be $850,000 for a government entity. 

            In written testimony, the Maryland Catholic Conference, which represents the three dioceses serving the state, opposed the bill, saying the elimination of the civil statute of limitations retroactively “raises serious equity concerns and is particularly unnecessary in Maryland, which does not have a criminal statute of limitations for cases of child sexual abuse.”

            “While there is clearly no financial compensation that can ever rectify the harm done to a survivor of sexual abuse, the devastating impact that the retroactive window provision will potentially have by exposing public and private institutions — and the communities they serve — to unsubstantiated claims of abuse, cannot be ignored,” the conference said in its testimony.

            In 2017, Maryland raised the age limit that accusers can file lawsuits from 25 to 38. But the law also included language, known as a statute of repose, that some say prevents lawmakers from extending the statute of limitations again.

            The issue is getting added attention in Maryland after an investigation by the state's attorney general identified 158 Roman Catholic priests in the Archdiocese of Baltimore who have been accused of sexually and physically abusing more than 600 victims over the past 80 years, according to court records made public in November. But the full report on the investigation, which began in 2019, has not been made public. 

            Court permission is required to make the report public because it contains information from grand jury subpoenas. It’s unclear when the court will make a decision.ANNAPOLIS, Md.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819780,Longtime soccer hotbed St. Louis finally gets MLS team,"ST. LOUIS (AP) — When season tickets sales began for Major League Soccer's newest team, St. Louis City SC leaders figured they'd be a hot ticket in a city with a deep love for the sport.

            Even they were caught off guard by the response: More than 60,000 deposits for the 19,000 available season passes.

            “St. Louisans are so proud of their city and so supportive of anything like this,” team President and CEO Carolyn Kindle said. “I had no idea how crazy that support was going to go.”











            Seven years ago, the NFL's Rams departed for Los Angeles after making the case that St. Louis wasn't big enough and lacked the corporate support for three pro sports franchises. Soccer fans beg to differ.

            The privately built, 22,500-seat, $458 million CityPark Stadium is spurring new development in the western area of downtown. Team merchandise sales ranked in the top five in MLS in 2022 — before the team played a game.

            The franchise-opener is Saturday in Austin, Texas. The first home game is March 4 against Charlotte.

            ""It’s a big thing for the city, not just for soccer,” said Dave Lange, a St. Louis soccer historian. “There’s a lot of pent-up enthusiasm.”

            MLS Commissioner Don Garber said he believed the loss of the Rams “helped energize the community to get behind a sport they love.”

            “In order to be successful in sports you need to have a devoted, committed owner, you need to have a great facility and you need to have a market that really loves and understands the game,” Garber said. “We have all three of those in place now.”

            Lange, author of “Soccer Made in St. Louis: A History of the Game in America’s First Soccer Capital,” said the first record of soccer play in St. Louis was in 1872. European immigrants brought the love of the game with them, and passed it down.

            Soccer became the sport of choice in the region's Catholic schools and it flourished. Five St. Louis residents started for the 1950 World Cup team that pulled off what is still recognized as one of the sport’s greatest upsets, a 1-0 defeat of England. St. Louis University became a soccer powerhouse, winning 10 national championships.

            Even indoor soccer was popular. The St. Louis Steamers arrived in 1979 and played to sellout crowds. Lange recalled how he could feel the old Arena shaking during many games. “The noise and passion levels were incredible,” he said.

            Amid that backdrop, it was perhaps surprising it took so long for St. Louis to land in the MLS. In fact, a 2017 effort to get a team failed when voters turned down a ballot measure to help fund a new stadium.

            A year later, Kindle recalled how her uncle, Andy Taylor, called a family meeting to discuss soccer. Taylor is executive chairman of Enterprise Holdings, the nation's largest car rental company. He is the son of founder Jack Taylor. Kindle is Jack Taylor's granddaughter.

            Kindle said her previous connection with soccer ended when she played on her eighth-grade “C” team. But she and the rest of her family recognized the potential that MLS could bring to St. Louis and sought a meeting with Garber.

            The league wanted proof of corporate support so the Taylors reached out to 25 of the region's largest companies.

            “That’s when we had that lunch in March of 2019 so that Commissioner Garber could actually sit down and talk to heads of corporations in the region and hear from them how much they wanted, and would support, a soccer team,” Kindle said.

            It worked. St. Louis was awarded a franchise in August 2019. Garber said he was especially impressed by the support from officials from baseball's Cardinals and the NHL's Blues.

            Kindle said the business community recognized what soccer can help offer them.

            ""If you look at some of the demographics of soccer fans, they have a tendency to be younger,” Kindle said. “The corporate community really was enamored by the possibilities of what having a professional soccer team could mean because it would hopefully add to the package that is St. Louis to make it an attractive place to recruit businesses, families and students.”

            The new facility is one of the few in American sports where the team headquarters, stadium and training area are all in the same place — a tunnel below the street takes players and coaches to the practice facility.

            A view to the east shows the Gateway Arch. Seating aisles rise steeply, with no seat more than 120 feet from the field. Rather than offering traditional stadium fare, food is provided by some of St. Louis' hottest restauranteurs.

            The stadium sits in an area once known as Mill Creek Valley. About 20,000 people, most of them Black, lived there until 1959, when the neighborhood was demolished. Described at the time as “urban renewal,"" the area ended up being a long interstate exit ramp and vacant land.

            A courtyard outside the stadium includes a tribute to Mill Creek Valley.

            Garber said St. Louis' response to the franchise has been overwhelming.

            “It’s really heartwarming to be delivering Major League Soccer and soccer at the highest level to a community that loves the game,"" Garber said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819781,March Madness: Clutch performances as women's tourney begins,"March Madness has begun! Here is what to know about the women’s NCAA Tournament, including the favorites and underdogs as well as key games and how to watch:TOP SEEDSThe top four seeds in the tournament are South Carolina, Indiana, Virginia Tech and Stanford. Each is in a region, some tougher than others (on paper).We break them down for you:SOUTH CAROLINA: The undefeated defending national champions are the No. 1 overall seed they opened with an easy win over Norfolk State. The Greenville I Region includes two teams in No. 2 seed Maryland and No. 4 seed UCLA that lost to the Gamecocks earlier this season. South Carolina is loaded, with two-time Southeastern Conference player of the year Aliyah Boston and leading scorer Zia Cooke.INDIANA: The Hoosiers landed the top seed in the Greenville II Region and start against red-hot Tennessee Tech, which has won eight games in a row. Mackenzie Holmes leads Indiana with 22.3 points and 7.3 rebounds per game. Top challengers include No. 2 seed Utah, No. 3 seed LSU and No. 4 seed Villanova, which is led by scoring sensation Maddy Siegrist.VIRGINIA TECH: The Hokies won their first ACC Tournament championship and top the Seattle 3 Region. Elizabeth Kitley has stepped things up down the stretch as Virginia Tech won its final eight games. Virginia Tech could have to navigate No. 4 seed Tennessee in the Sweet 16 and No. 2 seed UConn or No. 3 seed Ohio State after that.STANFORD: The committee looked to Stanford's steadiness for much of the season in giving it the top seed in the Seattle 4 Region. The Cardinal are led by Cameron Brink and Haley Jones, who have combined to score more than 28 points per game this season, though Brink missed the opener with an illness. Look for a potential high-wattage battle for the Final Four against No. 2 seed Iowa, led by national player of the year candidate Caitlin Clark.GAMES TO WATCHNo. 5 seed Louisville (23-11) vs. No. 12 seed Drake (22-9), Saturday. The Cardinals were a Final Four team a season ago and start their journey back as a No. 5 seed. They’ll open things against Drake (22-9), which was seeded fourth in the Missouri Valley Conference Tournament yet defeated Belmont to take the league’s automatic bid. Louisville is led by Hailey Van Lith, who's averaged 19.2 points a game this season.No. 4 seed Villanova (28-6) vs. No. 13 seed Cleveland State (30-4), Saturday. Villanova features one of the country's best players in Maddy Siegrist, a two-time Big East player of year. Cleveland State won the Horizon League and made the NCAA tourney for the first time since 2010. Villanova is in a stacked region with top seed Indiana, No. 2 seed Utah and No. 3 seed LSU in front of them. If the Wildcats get to the second round, they might face Washington State — the team that has the support of country music superstar Shania Twain, thanks to social media.PLAYERS TO WATCHThe women's tournament field is filled with stars, including South Carolina's Aliyah Boston, last season's AP player of the year who is back in hopes of winning a second straight national title. She will have plenty of competition for the honor this year, including sharp-shooting Iowa star Caitlin Clark.There is also center Mackenzie Holmes of top-seeded Indiana and the AP All-America team is also a good place to check out some of the top players in the game. The Cavinder twins, gym rats who are wildly popular on social media, made their first tournament after transferring from Fresno State to Miami.The field is also remarkable for the high number of international players, a growing trend in women's basketball. Alas, some of the top programs are also dealing with injuries to key players. Notre Dame lost star Olivia Miles for the rest of the season and Florida State lost its opener after losing two more players to injuries.SHINING MOMENTSThe tournament's opening day saw a host of standout performances.Grace Stone nailed her fifth 3-pointer of the game with 4.7 seconds remaining to lift 10th-seeded Princeton to a 64-63 win over North Carolina State. Alissa Pili had a career-high 33 points, eight rebounds and a career-high eight assists to lead No. 2 seed Utah over Gardner-Webb.Then there was Myah Selland, who scored 29 points to lead No. 9 seed South Dakota State to a 62-57 overtime win against Southern Cal.Power forward like Angel Reese had 34 points and 15 rebounds as 3-seed LSU beat Hawaii and fellow All-American Caitlin Clark had 26 points and 12 assists to help 2-seed Iowa beat Southeastern Louisiana.GO DEEPERGun violence has cost lives and disrupted college sports all season, touching some of the top programs in college basketball. Coaches have been thrust into uncertain and unwelcome roles in trying to navigate the topic — as well as the fallout from the Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe vs. Wade.On a lighter note, the Big Ten is loaded and eager to climb back into the title game. And if you think you know the women's tournament, try this 25-question quiz from AP.Want to hear from the athletes themselves? UCLA freshman Kiki Rice and injured UConn star Paige Bueckers have each written diaries for AP as they get started on their NCAA tourney journeys.HOW TO WATCHThe title game will be on a national network — ABC — for the first time since 1996 in a stroke of good news for the game. ABC plans to air at least a half-dozen other games, too.Beside that, every game of the women’s tournament will be available on ESPN's networks or streaming, with fans encouraged to navigate to the “Watch” tab on ESPN’s sites. The NCAA will have a women's basketball specific March Madness app by AT&T.There are multiple sites listing game times and other details, including the NCAA site.BETTING GUIDEWho’s going to win the national championship? The betting favorites this week to reach the Final Four are (in order): South Carolina, Indiana, UConn, Stanford, LSU and Iowa, according to FanDuel Sportsbook. The Gamecocks are a heavy favorite to become the first repeat champion in the women’s tournament since UConn won the last of four straight in 2016.MARCH MADNESS CALENDARSelection Sunday set the brackets for First Four games and first- and second-round games through Monday at campuses across the country.Sweet 16 weekend brings a twist this year for the women’s teams: There will be two regional sites instead of four, with Greenville, South Carolina, and Seattle each hosting eight teams.Where is the women’s Final Four? In Dallas, where the semifinals are March 31 and the championship game is April 2. As it happens, the men’s Final Four is a four-hour drive down the road in Houston that same weekend.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/18,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819783,"One year on, Ukrainians in U.S. cope with war, displacement","PORT READING, N.J. (AP) — In New York, far from her home in northern Ukraine, Valeriya Roshkovan tries to do what she can to end Russia's invasion of her country.

            “I cannot sit and do nothing,"" she said earlier this month in a New Jersey warehouse where she volunteers with the nonprofit Razom for Ukraine, helping package donated firefighting equipment to ship to her country. 

            Roshkovan, 41, fled Konotop, her city close to Ukraine's northern border with Belarus, soon after the fighting began in order to keep her teenage daughter safe. She had to leave her husband and other family behind. 











            “The town was surrounded, all the artillery was pointed at the town and most of the exits were already in the hands of Russia,” Roshkovan said through another volunteer who translated her words. 

            “We had the hope that it’s going to finish very soon, that the war will be over,” she added. “And that we will be able to come back quickly.”

            As the first anniversary of Russia's invasion approaches Friday, that hope is diminished. Roshkovan has enrolled her teenage daughter in school. She's trying to get her to engage with their Brooklyn, New York, surroundings and to stop dwelling on the war and their long escape, driving through Ukraine and several neighboring countries. 

            Last year, many Ukrainians living in America discovered Razom, a small nonprofit that started in 2014 with the mission to help make Ukraine more prosperous. In previous years, it had received around $200,000 in contributions annually. In 2022, the number of donors jumped from around 4,000 to 170,000 and gifts now total at least $75 million, said Dora Chomiak, the organization’s president.

            “A lot of people are just moved by the complete injustice of the bad guy next door to Ukraine, just destroying lives. People are moved by the resilience of the people of Ukraine,” she said. 

            The nonprofit stood up a logistics network, opened and staffed an office in Washington to advocate for Ukraine to lawmakers and granted at least $3 million to small nonprofits in Ukraine. They've held almost weekly protests in Times Square to try to keep the war in the public eye. Support for sending weapons and aid to Ukraine and for hosting Ukrainians displaced by the war among Americans has waned from May to January, a recent poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found. 

            Initially, Razom focused on sourcing and delivering tactical medical equipment and communications equipment to the frontlines, including to volunteer fighters. 

            “Tourniquets, chest seals, different bandages to either stop bleeding or give the first help at the battlefield,” said Andriy Boychuk, 35, a businessman who has lived in the U.S. for 17 years and was leading the effort at the warehouse. 

            “If not us, who else?” he said, when asked why a nonprofit was sending supplies to the frontlines. More recently, it has shipped generators, wood burning stoves and candles to its warehouse in Lviv, tracking the shipments with a software program that Razom members developed themselves. Razom’s staff in Ukraine then reloads the goods into vans to take where needed.

            Boychuk and other volunteers said packing these supplies by hand is a kind of therapy for them, helping them feel like they are making a difference.

            “It touches everybody,"" Boychuk said of the war. ""And that’s why I think we are here, because we want to help and try to not think what’s going on there because it destroys people,” 

            The aid they send is in line with Razom’s charitable mission, as well as import and export regulations, Chomiak said. But that line is sometimes difficult to navigate.

            “Who is a civilian and who is military? That was hard for myself personally to kind of parse out,” she said, until she realized while visiting Ukraine in the summer that everyone was fighting to survive, in one way or another. 

            Another volunteer, Dmytro Malymonenko, learned about Razom when the war began, through Boychuk, who is a neighbor. “I wanted to help but didn’t know how and where to start and where to look for the community,” he said. 

            Over the past year, the war's impact has intensified for him. Malymonenko’s mother recently died in Ukraine of an illness he said was exacerbated by the stress and depression caused by the war. His father returned to their hometown of Sumy, which has been under bombardment, to organize a funeral. 

            His life has been torn apart, he said, urging everyone to take some action.

            “Even a thought or a prayer can help,” he said.

            Roshkovan said it still gives her goosebumps to talk about the war, which she did not believe would break out between countries whose populations have been intertwined for generations. 

            “It’s not just the war. It’s not just the aggression that happened,"" she said, touching the skin on her forearms. ""But it’s also the basically breakage of those ties. It’s the huge betrayal.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819784,Investigation begins into Arkansas plane crash that killed 5,"LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) — Federal investigators headed to Arkansas Thursday to determine the cause of a small plane crash that killed five employees of an environmental consulting firm. 

            Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board planned to begin work to document the crash site and examine the plane’s wreckage, agency spokesperson Jennifer Gabris said in an email. 

            Gabris said a preliminary report on their findings should be released in about two weeks.











            A twin-engine Beech B2000 airplane crashed at about noon Wednesday near an industrial site in Little Rock shortly after taking off from the Bill and Hillary Clinton National Airport. The Pulaski County Sheriff's Office confirmed that all five people on board the plane were killed. The plane was heading to Columbus, Ohio. 

            Environmental consulting firm CTEH, based in Little Rock, said the five dead, including the pilot, were all employees responding to the scene of an Ohio metals plant where an explosion this week killed one worker and sent more than a dozen to the hospital.

            CTEH on Thursday identified the dead employees as Gunter Beaty, 23, a production safety data manager; Kyle Bennett, 36, a staffing manager, logistics; Micah Kendrick, 41, a safety supervisor; Sean Sweeney, 64, a pilot; and Glenmarkus Walker, 32, a rapid responder. 

            The crash occurred as a line of thunderstorms that the National Weather Service said included wind gusts of 40 mph (64 kph) moved through the Little Rock area. The NTSB said its investigators will be looking into whether weather and other factors played a role in the crash.LITTLE ROCK, Ark.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819785,Teen athlete loses legs; St. Louis prosecutor under scrutiny,"ST. LOUIS (AP) — A St. Louis prosecutor decried efforts to oust her from office Thursday and defended herself from blame after a teenage volleyball player from Tennessee lost both her legs in a vehicle crash that police say was caused by a speeding driver facing felony charges.

            St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner, a Democrat, said her office tried three times to revoke the bond of 21-year-old Daniel Riley, a robbery suspect who had violated the conditions of his release dozens of times before the tragic crash in downtown St. Louis. 

            But Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, a Republican, pinned the blame on Gardner for failing to keep Riley behind bars. He filed court documents Thursday seeking Gardner’s ouster on three grounds: failure to prosecute existing cases, failure to file charges in cases brought by police, and failure to confer with and inform victims and their families about the status of cases.











            “This is about the rule of law and about justice,” Bailey told reporters at the Capitol. “Instead of protecting victims, which is her obligation, she’s creating more victims by neglect in office.”

            Gardner vowed to remain in her job, accusing the attorney general of a “political stunt” to “stop the voice of the people of the city of St. Louis” who elected her.

            Seventeen-year-old Janae Edmondson was walking with her family to their downtown St. Louis hotel Saturday night when she was struck. Police said Riley, who did not have a valid drivers license, sped through an intersection and collided with another car before hitting Edmondson and a parked vehicle. 

            The high school senior from Smyrna, Tennessee, is “stable and alert and with her family,” said Jeff Wismer, a coach at Mid-TN Volleyball Club. As of Thursday, a GoFundMe campaign on Edmondson's behalf had raised around $400,000. 

            “The question needs to be, how was this young man in a car?” the coach asked. “How was this young man out of his house? How was this young man even in his home and not in prison?”

            Riley was out on bond after a 2020 robbery charge that was dismissed and refiled last year. His bond violations included letting his GPS monitor die and breaking terms for his house arrest, according to court records.

            Bailey's court filing said Riley had 94 bond violations since September 2020. To support claims that Gardner has failed in her prosecutorial duties, Bailey cited more than 200 pending murder and manslaughter cases and more than 4,000 other cases awaiting her office's review after being submitted by police. 

            Court officials said they didn’t know Riley had violated his bond because prosecutors never filed a motion to revoke it.

            Gardner said Thursday that her office had verbally asked three times for Riley's bond to be revoked, but a judge either denied or ignored the requests.

            “While it is true my office could have done more, to say we did nothing is only disingenuous (and) is willfully ignorant of the reality of our court system,"" Gardner said during a Thursday press conference interrupted by cheers from supporters. 

            Riley's former attorney agrees with Gardner. In a blog post, attorney Terence Niehoff wrote that an assistant prosecutor “did bring to the Court's attention Riley's numerous bond violations,” but judges allowed him to remain free.

            Several dozen Black leaders were present at a news conference with Gardner, who is Black. Prominent civil rights activist Zaki Baruti said the attorney general's statement ""speaks of arrogance, and it speaks of racism.”

            Bailey denounced such assertions as false. Republican Gov. Mike Parson and the state's top Republican lawmakers all expressed their support for the attorney general's attempt to remove Gardner from office. Senate Republicans also submitted an official denouncement of Gardner and called on her to resign. 

            Democratic St. Louis Mayor Tishaura O. Jones said Gardner had “lost the trust of the people,” but did not call for her resignation.

            Riley was jailed after the crash. A judge on Tuesday ordered him held without bond.

            Attempts to oust elected officials in Missouri are rare but not unprecedented. In 2009, Democratic Attorney General Chris Koster asked a judge to remove Dent County prosecutor Jessica Sparks, a Republican. Koster alleged Sparks had failed to fulfill her duties, misused her office by accusing police of misconduct and had been involved in domestic disturbances. She resigned before a judge could rule on the ouster request.

            Meanwhile, a bill advancing in the Missouri Legislature would allow Parson to appoint a special prosecutor to handle violent crimes in St. Louis, with supporters contending Gardner has not been tough enough on crime. Gardner’s supporters rallied earlier this month in Jefferson City, saying the effort to take away her power was racially motivated.

            Gardner drew national attention in 2018 when she charged then-Gov. Eric Greitens with felony invasion of privacy, accusing him of taking a compromising photo of a woman during an extramarital affair. Greitens, a Republican, accused her of a political attack. The charge was later dropped. But Greitens, also under investigation by Missouri lawmakers, resigned in June 2018.

            The case drew scrutiny that led to the conviction of Gardner’s investigator, and discipline for her.

            In March, investigator William Tisaby pleaded guilty to misdemeanor evidence tampering. A month later, Gardner reached an agreement with the Missouri Office of Disciplinary Counsel in which she acknowledged that she failed to produce documents as part of the Greitens investigation and mistakenly maintained that all documents had been provided to Greitens’ lawyers. She received a written reprimand.

            She drew the ire of St. Louis police in 2019 when she placed dozens of officers on an “exclusion list,” prohibiting them from bringing cases. The list was developed after a national group accused the officers of posting racist and anti-Muslim comments on social media.

            In 2020, Gardner filed a lawsuit accusing the city, a police union and others of a coordinated and racist conspiracy aimed at forcing her out of office. The lawsuit alleged violations of the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871, which was adopted to thwart efforts to deny the civil rights of racial minorities.

In a blog post, attorney Terence Niehoff wrote that an assistant prosecutor “did bring to the Court's attention Riley's numerous bond violations,” but judges allowed him to remain free.Several dozen Black leaders were present at a news conference with Gardner, who is Black. Prominent civil rights activist Zaki Baruti said the attorney general's statement ""speaks of arrogance, and it speaks of racism.”Bailey denounced such assertions as false. Republican Gov. Mike Parson and the state's top Republican lawmakers all expressed their support for the attorney general's attempt to remove Gardner from office. Senate Republicans also submitted an official denouncement of Gardner and called on her to resign.Democratic St. Louis Mayor Tishaura O. Jones said Gardner had “lost the trust of the people,” but did not call for her resignation.Riley was jailed after the crash. A judge on Tuesday ordered him held without bond.Attempts to oust elected officials in Missouri are rare but not unprecedented. In 2009, Democratic Attorney General Chris Koster asked a judge to remove Dent County prosecutor Jessica Sparks, a Republican. Koster alleged Sparks had failed to fulfill her duties, misused her office by accusing police of misconduct and had been involved in domestic disturbances. She resigned before a judge could rule on the ouster request.Meanwhile, a bill advancing in the Missouri Legislature would allow Parson to appoint a special prosecutor to handle violent crimes in St. Louis, with supporters contending Gardner has not been tough enough on crime. Gardner’s supporters rallied earlier this month in Jefferson City, saying the effort to take away her power was racially motivated.Gardner drew national attention in 2018 when she charged then-Gov. Eric Greitens with felony invasion of privacy, accusing him of taking a compromising photo of a woman during an extramarital affair. Greitens, a Republican, accused her of a political attack. The charge was later dropped. But Greitens, also under investigation by Missouri lawmakers, resigned in June 2018.The case drew scrutiny that led to the conviction of Gardner’s investigator, and discipline for her.In March, investigator William Tisaby pleaded guilty to misdemeanor evidence tampering. A month later, Gardner reached an agreement with the Missouri Office of Disciplinary Counsel in which she acknowledged that she failed to produce documents as part of the Greitens investigation and mistakenly maintained that all documents had been provided to Greitens’ lawyers. She received a written reprimand.She drew the ire of St. Louis police in 2019 when she placed dozens of officers on an “exclusion list,” prohibiting them from bringing cases. The list was developed after a national group accused the officers of posting racist and anti-Muslim comments on social media.In 2020, Gardner filed a lawsuit accusing the city, a police union and others of a coordinated and racist conspiracy aimed at forcing her out of office. The lawsuit alleged violations of the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871, which was adopted to thwart efforts to deny the civil rights of racial minorities.___Lieb reported from Jefferson City, Missouri.",2023/02/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819786,Ozy Media founder Carlos Watson denies federal fraud charges,"NEW YORK (AP) — The founder of the troubled digital start-up Ozy Media pleaded not guilty Thursday to federal fraud charges accusing him of scheming to prop up his financially struggling company, which hemorrhaged millions of dollars before it shut down amid revelations of possibly deceptive business practices.

            Federal agents arrested Carlos Watson at a Manhattan hotel earlier in the day after two of the company's top executives pleaded guilty this month to fraud charges, including Ozy's then-chief operating officer, Samir Rao, who prosecutors say impersonated a YouTube executive during a pitch to Goldman Sachs, a potential investor.

            The indictment unsealed Thursday in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn accuses Watson and Ozy Media of conspiring to commit securities fraud and wire fraud. Watson was also charged with identity theft for his role in the impersonation of several media executives.











            In a parallel civil case, the Securities and Exchange Commission also charged Watson and the company with defrauding investors of about $50 million “through repeated misrepresentations concerning the company’s basic financial condition, business relationships, and fundraising efforts.”

            Ozy advertised itself as a progressive digital platform for “the New and the Next,” saying on its website that it sought to create a “space for fresh perspectives, introduces you to rising stars and breakthrough trends, and offers new takes on everything from news and culture to technology, business, learning and entertainment.” 

            Watson, a former host on MSNBC and CNN, cofounded the company with Rao in California's Silicon Valley a decade ago.

            But the company imploded under insurmountable debt and questions over its fundraising tactics. As its expenses mounted, it relied on high-interest loans and began to more aggressively court investors.

            Scrutiny deepened after the New York Times reported in October 2021 that an Ozy official had masqueraded as a YouTube executive in a failing attempt to get Goldman Sachs to infuse money into the struggling enterprise.

            Shortly after, Ozy said it was shutting down — although Watson has since tried to revive the endeavor.

            Watson's attorney, Lanny Breuer, said he was “deeply disappointed by the arrest"" and thought that “good faith and progressive dialogue” with the government were progressing.

            “Given the government’s claims of promoting such dialogue in general,"" Breuer said, ""I simply do not understand the dramatic decision to arrest Carlos this morning.”

            Watson was released following his arraignment after posting $1 million bond. He is expected to next appear in court April 3. Company representatives are back in court March 8.

            Rao pleaded guilty in federal court this week, while Ozy’s former chief of staff, Suzee Han, did so last week. Both were released on bail to await sentencing. The guilty pleas and arrests were first reported by the Wall Street Journal.

            In a statement posted on its website Thursday, the SEC said Rao and and Han “agreed to resolve the charges against them.""

            Authorities say Watson and his business partners, between 2018 and 2021, attempted to defraud investors and lenders of “tens of millions of dollars through fraudulent misrepresentations and omissions” about the company’s debts and other key financial information. At one point, the indictment alleges, the company used a forged contract to help win a loan from a bank.

            “As alleged, Carlos Watson is a con man whose business strategy was based on outright deceit and fraud,” Breon Peace, the U.S. Attorney for the Brooklyn-based Eastern District of New York, said in a statement. “He ran Ozy as a criminal organization rather than as a reputable media company.”

            Michael J. Driscoll, the assistant director-in-charge of the FBI’s New York field office added that Watson “repeatedly attempted to entice both investors and lenders through a series of deliberate deceptions and fabrications.”

            If convicted, Watson faces at least two years in prison up to a maximum of 37 years, the U.S. attorney's office said.

            The SEC’s civil complaint, also filed in the U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, accuses Watson and the company of violating anti-fraud provisions of federal securities laws. 

            “We allege that over the course of several years, the defendants raised approximately $50 million from victim investors on the basis of fraudulent documents and repeated misrepresentations, including, at least in one case, falsely impersonating a potential business partner during a meeting with an investment bank,” said Gurbir S. Grewal, the SEC’s director of enforcement.

            The agency, whose regulatory responsibilities include protecting investors, accused Ozy officials of “routinely and purposely"" presenting potential investors with dubious financial information, including falsely claiming that the company's revenues were at least twice what they actually were.

            In addition, the SEC said, Watson and Rao also sought investments by allegedly telling prospective investors that they were securing money from high-profile companies and investors.

            In one case, the SEC and federal prosecutors contend, Watson and Rao launched a ruse that had Rao impersonating a YouTube executive to convince a prospective investor that it was getting licensing revenue from the online video-sharing behemoth.

            When the potential investor discovered the alleged ploy, Watson asserted that Rao was suffering from a “mental health crisis,” the SEC said.NEW YORK (AP) — The founder of the troubled digital start-up Ozy Media pleaded not guilty Thursday to federal fraud charges accusing him of scheming to prop up his financially struggling company, which hemorrhaged millions of dollars before it shut down amid revelations of possibly deceptive business practices.Federal agents arrested Carlos Watson at a Manhattan hotel earlier in the day after two of the company's top executives pleaded guilty this month to fraud charges, including Ozy's then-chief operating officer, Samir Rao, who prosecutors say impersonated a YouTube executive during a pitch to Goldman Sachs, a potential investor.The indictment unsealed Thursday in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn accuses Watson and Ozy Media of conspiring to commit securities fraud and wire fraud.

            ENGLAND

            Fulham has been one of the big surprises in the Premier League this season and can move to within a point of the Champions League qualification places with a home win over Wolverhampton. Fulham is in sixth place in its first season after promotion, having started out as one of the favorites for relegation. It is coming off back-to-back wins, against Nottingham Forest and Brighton. Another win would see Fulham join fifth-place Newcastle on 41 points. Top scorer Aleksandar Mitrovic is an injury doubt for Fulham after missing the Brighton game. Wolverhampton is in 15th place in the 20-team league, three points above the relegation zone.











            SPAIN

            Real Betis visits last-place Elche aiming to collect an easy three points that will keep it in the hunt for a top-four finish and a resulting Champions League berth. Elche looks destined for the second division after managing to win just once in 22 rounds played so far this season. Manuel Pellegrini’s Betis is in fifth place and just four points behind Atletico Madrid, which faces a tough game at Real Madrid on Saturday.

            GERMANY

            Coming off a morale-boosting win over Bayern Munich last week, Borussia Mönchengladbach visits mid-table rival Mainz. Gladbach beat Bayern 3-2 with help from an early red card for Bayern defender Dayot Upamecano. Gladbach is eighth and Mainz is ninth after recent inconsistencies, and the gap to the European places has widened.

            FRANCE

            Having narrowly lost 4-3 to league leader Paris Saint-Germain last weekend, Lille will be confident when it hosts struggling Brest. Victory would move Lille above Rennes into fifth place. Lille striker Jonathan David is tied with Kylian Mbappé atop the scoring charts with 15 goals. Brest is just one point above the relegation zone and has conceded 40 goals in 24 games this season.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819788,China's global influence worries U.S. majority: AP-NORC poll,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Just 40% of U.S. adults approve of how President Joe Biden is handling relations with China, a new poll shows, with a majority anxious about Beijing's influence as the White House finds its agenda increasingly shaped by global rivalries.

            About 6 in 10 say they are gravely concerned about China, the world’s second-largest economy after the United States, according to the survey by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Biden has portrayed his domestic agenda on infrastructure and computer chip development as part of a broader competition with China, arguing that the future is at stake. 

            
                Tensions with China are crackling after government officials discovered and shot down a Chinese spy balloon two weeks ago. The Biden administration has preserved tariffs on imports from China and restricted the sale of advanced computer chips to the country, angering Chinese officials who want to fuel faster economic growth. 











            There are additional concerns over whether China will provide some form of military support for Russia's war in Ukraine. As the war nears its one-year mark, the poll shows that serious concern about the threat Russia poses to the U.S. has fallen. Concern about China now outpaces that about Russia; last year, about even percentages had named the two countries as a threat.

            Biden has tried to frame relations with China as a competition with boundaries, rather than as a larger geopolitical clash.

            “We seek competition, not conflict, with China,” Biden said last week. “ We’re not looking for a new Cold War. ... We’ll responsibly manage that competition so that it doesn’t veer into conflict.”

            Approval of Biden’s foreign policy is roughly in line with views of his presidency more broadly, a possible sign that his agenda is not viewed through its individual components but larger perceptions of the president himself.

            The poll found that 45% of U.S. adults say they approve of Biden’s overall performance, while 54% disapprove. That’s similar to views of Biden in recent months. Forty-one percent praised the president in late January and 43% did in December.

            Concern about China’s global influence as a threat to the U.S. is similar to last year but has grown steadily in recent years from 54% just after Biden took office and 48% in January 2020.

            Melvin Dunlap, 68, said Biden needed to be careful with China, given the U.S. reliance on Chinese manufacturing. The Peyton, Colorado, resident said he believes Biden “has a good heart” and “means well,” generally approving of Biden's approach.

            “You tread cautiously,” said Dunlap, who retired from law enforcement. “You show strength, not weakness.”

            Fewer adults feel as wary about Russia as they did just after its military invaded Ukraine last year. Now, 53% say they’re seriously concerned about Russia, down from 64% in March 2022. 

            Michael Marchek, 33, an engineer in the Atlanta area, said Russia's military has struggled in Ukraine, failing to achieve its goal of taking the capital of Kyiv and sustaining steep casualties that showed a sense of disarray.

            “I was more concerned about Russia before they proved they were less effective than they appeared to be on the surface,"" Marchek said. “They played their hand and they did not play their hand effectively. They have nuclear capabilities and other things, but I don’t think they’re interested in using them.”

            Biden made a surprise visit to Kyiv on Monday, declaring to that country's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, “You remind us that freedom is priceless; it’s worth fighting for for as long as it takes. And that’s how long we’re going to be with you, Mr. President, for as long as it takes.”

            To Ukraine's defense, the U.S. has committed tanks, armored vehicles, a thousand artillery systems, more than 2 million rounds of artillery ammunition and more than 50 advanced launch rocket systems, and anti-ship and air defense systems.

            While Biden views the preservation of NATO and countering Russian aggression as necessary, most U.S. adults say it should not come at the expense of their economy. Oil, natural gas and food prices initially worsened after Russian President Vladimir Putin sent troops into Ukraine last February, causing U.S. inflation to hit a 40-year high in June. Inflation has since eased, and the U.S. and much of Europe have so far evaded recessions despite the expected damage. Russia has adapted to financial sanctions and export controls designed to erode its ability to fund the war.

            Yet in a late January AP-NORC poll, a majority of U.S. adults – 59% -- said limiting damage to the American economy is more important than penalizing Russia, even if that means sanctions are less effective. The balance of opinion had been the reverse in the early months after the invasion.

            The U.S. economy remains a sensitive subject for Biden. People are generally unimpressed by the 3.4% unemployment rate. Nor has a seven-month decline in inflation — which is still running high — done much to assuage fears.

            While economists have yet to declare a recession, respondents to the survey feel as though the economy is mired in a downturn.

            Overall, the new poll shows 32% say the economy is in good shape. That’s a slight improvement from 24% in January, which was consistent with views late last year. Still, 68% say the economy is in bad shape, and approval of Biden’s job handling the economy has remained negative. Only 36% say they approve of the president on the economy, similar to last month and late last year.

            “It’s basically the inflation that we’re all worried about,” said Adriana Stan, 36, a teacher in Columbia, South Carolina.

            Stan bought a house in December at a 5.5% mortgage rate, more than double the rate during the coronavirus pandemic. The Federal Reserve has increased its own benchmark interest rates in order to push down inflation, a move that has also driven up borrowing costs for homebuyers. Stan said her grocery bills are also much higher.

            “We buy the same stuff,"" Stan said. ""But at the end of the month I feel like I’m paying so much more.”

            “I am honored to continue to have the support of leaders who believe, as I do, that our best days lie ahead,” McMaster told the AP. “Working together, the founders of the McMaster Leadership Fund will ensure ... that the issues the people of South Carolina demonstrated in November that they care about are the issues all of us remain focused on in Columbia.”

            McMaster, 75, defeated Democrat Joe Cunningham in November, winning reelection by more than 17 percentage points — the largest margin of victory a South Carolina gubernatorial election has seen in over three decades. Democrats last won the state’s top office in 1998 and have held no statewide elected offices since 2010.

            Having finished the two remaining years of Nikki Haley’s second term following her appointment as U.N. ambassador and winning election to two four-year terms, McMaster is on track to be South Carolina’s longest-serving governor.

            Previous governors have set up similar entities in the interest of advocating for their core issues. In 2006, as then-Gov. Mark Sanford angled for a potential future presidential bid, his supporters formed ReformSC, which was aimed at working toward government accountability and restructuring. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush headlined several fundraisers for the group in 2007, raising about $200,000.

            The McMaster Leadership Fund counts among its founding board members some of the governor's top supporters. It's chaired by Bill Stern, a Columbia real estate developer who organized both of McMaster's inaugural ceremonies, as well as Sanford's second inaugural, in 2007.

            “As the governor reminds us, South Carolina is on the cusp of a new era of unprecedented prosperity,” Stern told AP, echoing McMaster's forward-looking messaging. “All we have to do is build on the momentum he and Team South Carolina have generated.”

            Other members include former AT&T president Pamela Lackey and Henry Swink, owner of McCall Farms. Longtime McMaster advisor and fundraiser Marisa Crawford is leading fundraising.

(AP) — A former employee of a Massachusetts town is facing charges of allegedly setting up a secret cryptocurrency mining operation in a remote crawl space at a school, police said.

            Nadeam Nahas, 39, was scheduled to be arraigned Thursday on charges of fraudulent use of electricity and vandalizing a school, but he did not show up and a judge issued a default warrant after rejecting a defense motion to reschedule, a spokesperson for the Norfolk district attorney's office said. 

            A listed number for Nahas was not accepting messages on Thursday.











            Police responded to Cohasset Middle/High School in December 2021 after the town’s facilities director found electrical wires, temporary duct work, and numerous computers that seemed out of place while conducting a routine inspection of the school, Chief William Quigley of the Cohasset Police Department said in a statement Wednesday.

            He contacted the town's IT director, who determined that it was a cryptocurrency mining operation unlawfully hooked up to the school's electrical system, Quigley said.

            The Coast Guard Investigative Service and the Department of Homeland Security assisted with safely removing and examining the equipment.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819804,Baltimore to invest in Black communities ravaged by highway,"BALTIMORE (AP) — Using $2 million in federal grant funding, Baltimore officials will start developing a plan to reconnect Black neighborhoods by potentially demolishing a stretch of thoroughfare that displaced hundreds of families amid a failed highway construction project decades ago.

            The city’s so-called “Highway to Nowhere” was designed to connect the downtown business district to interstates surrounding Baltimore, and officials used eminent domain to demolish nearly 1,000 homes in the 1960s and ’70s, cutting a wide swath through predominantly middle class neighborhoods in majority-Black west Baltimore. 

            But construction of the thoroughfare was never finished — partly because residents in whiter, more affluent communities successfully campaigned against it — and the endeavor became largely pointless. 











            The project has received renewed attention in recent years as Baltimore leaders seek to address longstanding sources of inequity that have helped shape the city, which remains heavily segregated along racial and economic lines. 

            “I remember the once vibrant and connected communities that existed before the ‘Highway to Nowhere,’” U.S. Rep. Kweisi Mfume, a Baltimore Democrat, said in a statement announcing the grant award earlier this week. “It’s never too late to undo the wrongs of the past if we have a clear and renewed vision for the future.”

            The money will allow city transportation officials to create a plan for redeveloping the site, which could include demolishing the 1.4-mile stretch of expressway and replacing it with parkland or other public space. 

            In addition to transforming the area, the plan will focus on strengthening the surrounding community through improved access to jobs and quality housing, officials wrote in a 2022 grant application. They said it’s time for “catalytic investment” in impacted communities, calling the expressway “both a physical and symbolic barrier to progress.” 

            The funding comes as part of a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill that Congress passed in November 2021. The package included a grant program aimed at revitalizing areas harmed by highway construction, an issue members of Maryland’s congressional delegation had been working on for years with Baltimore’s failed highway project in mind. 

            With the incoming grant money, Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott said the city can finally begin to heal.

            “For over 50 years, this callous and discriminatory structure has caused generational damage to our community — displacing 1,500 residents, shuttering businesses and destroying homes — and this is a substantial step in starting that healing process,” Scott said in a statement Thursday. 

            At a public listening session last week, west Baltimore residents also demanded tangible improvements to help rebuild nearby communities suffering from deepening cycles of poverty, disinvestment, blight and crime. 

            In Poppleton, one of the affected neighborhoods, residents are currently fighting an ongoing urban renewal project they often compare to the failed expressway. They filed a complaint last week asking federal officials to investigate whether Baltimore’s redevelopment policies are perpetuating racial segregation and violating fair housing laws by disproportionately displacing Black and low-income residents, often using eminent domain to seize private property for public use.BALTIMORE (AP) — Using $2 million in federal grant funding, Baltimore officials will start developing a plan to reconnect Black neighborhoods by potentially demolishing a stretch of thoroughfare that displaced hundreds of families amid a failed highway construction project decades ago.The city’s so-called “Highway to Nowhere” was designed to connect the downtown business district to interstates surrounding Baltimore, and officials used eminent domain to demolish nearly 1,000 homes in the 1960s and ’70s, cutting a wide swath through predominantly middle class neighborhoods in majority-Black west Baltimore.But construction of the thoroughfare was never finished — partly because residents in whiter, more affluent communities successfully campaigned against it — and the endeavor became largely pointless.The project has received renewed attention in recent years as Baltimore leaders seek to address longstanding sources of inequity that have helped shape the city, which remains heavily segregated along racial and economic lines.“I remember the once vibrant and connected communities that existed before the ‘Highway to Nowhere,’” U.S. Rep.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819806,Australia holds off India to reach T20 World Cup final,"CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — Australia reached its seventh straight Women's T20 World Cup final by holding off India to win by five runs on Thursday.

            Chasing Australia's 172-4, India was 28-3 before a rally by the middle- and lower-order gave it a chance of an upset against the two-time defending champion and top-ranked team.

            India needed 20 off the last 12 balls of the semifinal after Jemimah Rodrigues (43 off 24 balls), captain Harmanpreet Kaur (52 off 34) and Deepti Sharma (20 not out off 17) dragged the last World Cup's losing finalist back into contention.











            Left-arm spinner Jess Jonassen bowled a superb penultimate over for Australia, holding India to just four runs off those six balls and claiming the wicket of Sneh Rana, who was bowled for 11.

            With 16 needed off the last over to win, or 15 to tie the scores and force a Super Over, India got 10 and fell just short at 167-8.

            “One of the best wins I’ve been involved in,” Australia captain Meg Lanning said. “India came hard at us so we knew this score would be hard to defend. But we pulled through in the clutch moments.”

            The crucial wicket for the Aussies came earlier when Rodrigues tried to ramp a short ball over wicketkeeper Alyssa Healy but only succeeded in edging it to Healy. That ended a partnership of 69 with Kaur that had put India ahead of the required run rate after 10 overs.

            Australia began to take control again when Kaur fell run out after getting her bat stuck in the ground as she tried to slide it into the crease.

            ""Can’t be unluckier than that,"" Kaur said of her run out. “Putting the effort in was important and we were happy to go to the last ball. We wanted to fight till the last ball.”

            Australia has won five of the seven T20 World Cups played, only missing out in 2016 when it lost to West Indies in the final and in the first tournament in 2009 when it lost in the semis.

            It has now made every final after 2009 and will play either England or host South Africa, who meet in the second semifinal on Friday.

            Australia's score against India was down to its top four batters, with Healy getting 25, fellow opener Beth Mooney 54 off 37, Lanning 49 not out and Ashleigh Gardner 31 from 18.

            India also paid for a couple of crucial misses. Wicketkeeper Richa Ghosh dropped a catch off Lanning when the Aussie captain was on 1. Mooney was dropped on 32.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819808,Purdue's Zach Edey makes strong case to be player of year,"WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) — Brian Nash vividly remembers the first impression Zach Edey made at IMG Academy.

            The school's coaches were fascinated with the basketball newcomer's size, his potential. They liked his hands, the footwork he developed playing other sports. They thought he could be college basketball's next big thing.

            Five years later, the transformation seems almost complete — to the surprise of Nash, IMG’s director of basketball operations. Edey, the 7-foot-4, 305-pound Canadian, is compiling numbers that show America's biggest player might also be its best player.











            “He's the most dominant player in the country and I would have never thought that would happen this quickly,” said Nash, who spent more than 20 seasons coaching at the college level after playing at Kansas State. “We looked at him as a piece of clay.”

            This more polished version of Edey creates the same wonder among fans he did with in Bradenton, Florida. He towers over almost anyone, his elbows reaching most players' necks thanks to a standing reach of 9 feet, 9 inches. 

            No. 5 Purdue eagerly exploits its advantage in the post when teams dare to single-cover Edey, and Edey gladly passes the ball when extra defenders converge. At times, the Boilermakers seem content taking shots and letting Edey score on putbacks.

            “It's amazing to see,"" said David Jenkins Jr., Purdue's sixth-year guard. “He's kind of a one of a kind. I've never played with someone like him, probably never will again.""

            It hasn't always been this way for the Toronto native, who started his athletic career playing hockey and later added baseball. By 14, he'd given up both sports. 

            His desire to earn a college scholarship to help his mother, Julia, eventually led him to his most natural sport and eventually to AAU basketball and IMG. (His mother is a former basketball player.)

            It didn't take coaches long to find a fit for Edey. They put the 16-year-old on a second-tier team for one year, primarily so he could refine his skills and learn to cope with the frustration of smaller players pestering him.

            The next season, Edey joined the school's elite national team, where he fought for minutes with three McDonald's All-Americans, an experience that helped shape Edey's selfless philosophy.

            “I don’t really care about how many points I get,” he said recently. ""I’m going to focus on rebounding, playing defense, blocking shots. I’ll score the ball when I have to, when I’m one-on-one but I’m not going to force one up.”

            Still, Edey stood out and emerged as an intriguing prospect. Santa Clara chased him early, and Edey initially appeared bound for Baylor. But the IMG coaches advised Edey to consider schools that had demonstrated they could develop big men.

            Gonzaga and Purdue emerged as finalists and that's when Purdue coach Matt Painter entered the fray.

            When Edey initially arrived at West Lafayette, he seemed more project than prospect; logging 14.6 minutes, scoring 8.7 points and grabbing 4.4 rebounds as a freshman in the 2020-21 season.

            But Painter knew there was more to the guy known to his mom as “Big Maple."" At IMG, Edey had worked with 7-foot-1 former NBA center and Puerto Rican Olympian Daniel Santiago to develop his post skills and passion for the sport.

            By his sophomore season, the workaholic emerged as a solid option alongside first team all-Big Ten forward Trevion Williams and future NBA lottery pick Jaden Ivey. Edey wound up nearly doubling his freshman stats, providing glimpses of his forthcoming breakout season.

            Edey opened this week leading the Big Ten in scoring (22.1 points) and rebounding (12.7) — ranked fifth and second nationally, respectively. He's 10th nationally in blocks (2.4) and has become a terrific interior passer.

            Edey also is a matchup nightmare for opponents. Penn State coach Micah Shrewsberry called him the best player on the best team in the country. And after Edey shredded Michigan State for 68 points and 30 rebounds in two games this season, coach Tom Izzo just shook his head.

            ""He’s bigger than any player I’ve ever coached against,” Izzo said. “When at the end of the day you can stop anywhere this side of the equator and throw the ball in the air and this monster is going to go get it, it makes it a little easier (for Purdue's offense).”

            Nebraska coach Fred Hoiberg understands the dilemma perhaps better than most after teaming up with 7-4, 250-pound Rik Smits with the NBA's Indiana Pacers.

            “Rik, I think if you looked at him at the same stage of their careers, Zach is just so much bigger than Rik was,"" Hoiberg said. ""(Edey's) body reminds me of Yao (Ming). He's got those thick legs, big shoulders, the wide hips and he's got great stamina for someone of that size.""

            But he's not just a challenge for defenses: In January, Painter complained opponents were taking advantage of no-calls by getting more physical with Edey. 

            Longtime college referee Ed Hightower, who critiques officials for the Big Ten, acknowledges Edey's size can be problematic for refs. He also believes Edey has matured as a player and led to him being less foul-prone than the last two seasons.

            “You have to concentrate on the balance between physicality and rough play, making sure you don't penalize him because of his size while not giving him an advantage because of his size,” Hightower said. “He knows how to use his size, physicality and agility. He's just a great player.”

            For Purdue, this week's focus is Saturday's rematch between Edey and Trayce Jackson-Davis and No. 14 Indiana. 

            Nationally, Edey is the center of attention, and the question is, what's next? A Final Four run? The NBA? A return to the Canadian national team? A return to Purdue? 

            Those who have seen Edey's rapid ascension believe there's no limit. 

            “He found his passion for the game and when you have success it increases your fire,” Nash said. “Now he's got a mean streak to him, too, where he turns those half-hooks into dunks. Zach is the story of the unknown.”

By 14, he'd given up both sports.His desire to earn a college scholarship to help his mother, Julia, eventually led him to his most natural sport and eventually to AAU basketball and IMG. (His mother is a former basketball player.)It didn't take coaches long to find a fit for Edey. They put the 16-year-old on a second-tier team for one year, primarily so he could refine his skills and learn to cope with the frustration of smaller players pestering him.The next season, Edey joined the school's elite national team, where he fought for minutes with three McDonald's All-Americans, an experience that helped shape Edey's selfless philosophy.“I don’t really care about how many points I get,” he said recently. ""I’m going to focus on rebounding, playing defense, blocking shots. I’ll score the ball when I have to, when I’m one-on-one but I’m not going to force one up.”Still, Edey stood out and emerged as an intriguing prospect. Santa Clara chased him early, and Edey initially appeared bound for Baylor. But the IMG coaches advised Edey to consider schools that had demonstrated they could develop big men.Gonzaga and Purdue emerged as finalists and that's when Purdue coach Matt Painter entered the fray.When Edey initially arrived at West Lafayette, he seemed more project than prospect; logging 14.6 minutes, scoring 8.7 points and grabbing 4.4 rebounds as a freshman in the 2020-21 season.But Painter knew there was more to the guy known to his mom as “Big Maple."" At IMG, Edey had worked with 7-foot-1 former NBA center and Puerto Rican Olympian Daniel Santiago to develop his post skills and passion for the sport.By his sophomore season, the workaholic emerged as a solid option alongside first team all-Big Ten forward Trevion Williams and future NBA lottery pick Jaden Ivey. Edey wound up nearly doubling his freshman stats, providing glimpses of his forthcoming breakout season.Edey opened this week leading the Big Ten in scoring (22.1 points) and rebounding (12.7) — ranked fifth and second nationally, respectively. He's 10th nationally in blocks (2.4) and has become a terrific interior passer.Edey also is a matchup nightmare for opponents. Penn State coach Micah Shrewsberry called him the best player on the best team in the country. And after Edey shredded Michigan State for 68 points and 30 rebounds in two games this season, coach Tom Izzo just shook his head.""He’s bigger than any player I’ve ever coached against,” Izzo said. “When at the end of the day you can stop anywhere this side of the equator and throw the ball in the air and this monster is going to go get it, it makes it a little easier (for Purdue's offense).”Nebraska coach Fred Hoiberg understands the dilemma perhaps better than most after teaming up with 7-4, 250-pound Rik Smits with the NBA's Indiana Pacers.“Rik, I think if you looked at him at the same stage of their careers, Zach is just so much bigger than Rik was,"" Hoiberg said. ""(Edey's) body reminds me of Yao (Ming). He's got those thick legs, big shoulders, the wide hips and he's got great stamina for someone of that size.""But he's not just a challenge for defenses: In January, Painter complained opponents were taking advantage of no-calls by getting more physical with Edey.Longtime college referee Ed Hightower, who critiques officials for the Big Ten, acknowledges Edey's size can be problematic for refs. He also believes Edey has matured as a player and led to him being less foul-prone than the last two seasons.“You have to concentrate on the balance between physicality and rough play, making sure you don't penalize him because of his size while not giving him an advantage because of his size,” Hightower said. “He knows how to use his size, physicality and agility. He's just a great player.”For Purdue, this week's focus is Saturday's rematch between Edey and Trayce Jackson-Davis and No. 14 Indiana.Nationally, Edey is the center of attention, and the question is, what's next? A Final Four run? The NBA? A return to the Canadian national team? A return to Purdue?Those who have seen Edey's rapid ascension believe there's no limit.“He found his passion for the game and when you have success it increases your fire,” Nash said. “Now he's got a mean streak to him, too, where he turns those half-hooks into dunks. Zach is the story of the unknown.”___AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/college-basketball and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/02/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819809,Attorneys allege Kenosha shooter Rittenhouse evading them,"MADISON, Wis. (AP) — Attorneys for a man shot and injured by Kyle Rittenhouse during a protest in 2020 are asking a federal judge to give them more time to serve Rittenhouse with a civil lawsuit, alleging that he is purposefully trying to evade them.

            Attorneys for Gaige Grosskreutz filed the request on Wednesday, the deadline that U.S. District Judge Lynn Adelman had given them to serve the lawsuit on Rittenhouse and the other defendants. Grosskreutz added Rittenhouse as a defendant last week in the lawsuit that also targets the city of Kenosha and local officials.

            The lawsuit, originally filed in October 2021, accuses Rittenhouse and other defendants, including a host of local law enforcement agencies, of causing the injuries that Grosskreutz suffered that night. It is seeking an unspecified amount of damages.











            The lawsuit is similar to one filed by the father of Anthony Huber, one of two men Rittenhouse shot and killed that night.

            Rittenhouse was charged with homicide, attempted homicide and reckless endangering for killing Huber and Joseph Rosenbaum and wounding Grosskreutz with an AR-style semi-automatic rifle in the summer of 2020 during a tumultuous night of protests over the shooting of a Black man, Jacob Blake, by a white Kenosha police officer.

            Rittenhouse was acquitted of all charges in November 2021 after testifying he acted in self-defense. Rittenhouse’s actions became a flashpoint in the debate over guns, vigilantism and racial injustice in the U.S. He was 17 at the time of the shootings and is now 20.

            An attorney for Grosskreutz said in a legal filing Wednesday that all of the other defendants, except for Rittenhouse, have accepted and waived service of the lawsuit. Rittenhouse's attorney in the Huber lawsuit said he was not authorized to accept service and a person believed to be Rittenhouse's mother who answered the door at a home in Florida said “Rittenhouse had been gone for a while,” according to the filing.

            Grosskreutz “is currently unaware of Mr. Rittenhouse's current whereabouts and is concerned that Mr. Rittenhouse is attempting to evade service,” according to the filing seeking a 60-day extension to serve him.

            Rittenhouse last week changed attorneys for the Huber lawsuit, going back to one of his defense attorneys from the trial, Mark Richards. Richards said Thursday that he does not represent Rittenhouse in the Grosskreutz lawsuit.

            Richards also said he does not know where Rittenhouse is. 

            “I don't know how to find Kyle,” Richards said. “I do not currently know where Kyle is.”

            Adelman, in the Huber lawsuit, earlier this month denied a motion by Rittenhouse and other defendants seeking to dismiss the case. The judge said in that case that Huber’s death “could plausibly be regarded as having been proximately caused by the actions of the governmental defendants.”

            Attorneys and private investigators for Huber's father spent over 100 hours trying to locate Rittenhouse, tracking down addresses in seven states before they found the home of his mother and sister in Florida. The lawsuit was served on Rittenhouse’s sister, who said that he wasn’t home. Adelman said that was sufficient to qualify as being served in the Huber case.

            Rittenhouse's attorneys had argued that the Huber case against him should be dismissed because Rittenhouse wasn’t properly served with the lawsuit. Adelman dismissed that, saying that Rittenhouse “is almost certainly evading service.”

            “Rittenhouse has been deliberately cagey about his whereabouts,” Adelman wrote earlier this month. “Although he denies living in Florida, he does not identify the place that he deems to be his residence.”

            In 2020, Rittenhouse went to Kenosha from his home in nearby Antioch, Illinois, after businesses were ransacked and burned in the nights that followed Blake’s shooting. He joined other armed civilians on the streets, carrying a weapon authorities said was illegally purchased for him because he was underage.

            Rittenhouse first killed Rosenbaum, 36, in the parking lot of an auto dealership and as Rittenhouse ran from the scene he stumbled and fell. Huber, 26, struck Rittenhouse with his skateboard and tried to disarm him. Rittenhouse fell to the ground and shot Huber to death and wounded demonstrator Grosskreutz, who was 27 at the time.

            Rittenhouse has maintained a high public profile, particularly on social media, where he is an outspoken advocate for gun rights. He has nearly 1 million followers on Twitter and has spoken at conservative gatherings.

            He tweeted a fundraising plea this week in reference to the Grosskreutz lawsuit, saying: ""This lawsuit is an attempt to drown anyone who legally and justifiably defends there lives from attackers in a mountain of legal debt. We can not let them win. If they can come after me they will come after you.”

            Grosskreutz, who testified at the trial, last year sought to change his legal name because of what he now says was continued harassment related to the case.MADISON, Wis.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819810,Rihanna will sing 'Lift Me Up' at the Oscars next month,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Rihanna will follow-up her soaring Super Bowl halftime show with a performance at the Super Bowl of movies — the Oscars.

            Producers of the telecast said Thursday that the music superstar will sing “Lift Me Up” from “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.” 

            “Lift Me Up,” with music by Tems, Rihanna, Ryan Coogler and Ludwig Göransson and lyric by Tems and Ryan Coogler, is nominated for original song. It is Rihanna’s first Oscar nomination.











            Earlier this month, the Barbadian superstar, dressed in a bright red jumpsuit, plowed through 12 of her hits in 13 minutes, at the Super Bowl at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. The performance doubled as an announcement to the world that she was pregnant with her second child.

            Hosted by Jimmy Kimmel, the 95th Oscars will air live on ABC and broadcast outlets worldwide on March 12.

            Among Oscar competitors that Rihanna faces is Lady Gaga, who was nominated for “Hold My Hand” from “Top Gun: Maverick.” Lady Gaga co-wrote the song with BloodPop and it's her fourth nomination; she won an Oscar in 2019 for “Shallow” with Bradley Cooper. 

            Another nominee is Diane Warren, who received her 14th Oscar nomination through her song “Applause” from “Tell It Like a Woman.” The prolific songwriter was recognized with an honorary Oscar at the Governors Awards last year.

            Other best original song nominees are M.M. Keeravaani’s “Naatu Naatu” from “RRR,” which was written by Chandrabose, and “This is a Life” from “Everything Everywhere All at Once.” The latter track was created by Mitski, David Byrne and Ryan Lott, who along with his band Son Lux was also nominated for best original score.

Ndiaye praised Lassalle as a ""very dedicated Spanish teacher.""French President Emmanuel Macron earlier said the nation is by the side of the victim's family, colleagues and students.Psychiatrists have been sent to the Saint Thomas d'Aquin Catholic high school where the attack occurred, to help victims mentally process the tragedy.An emergency psychiatric doctor told the AFP news agency that people at the school were feeling ""frustration, exhaustion (and) excesses of emotion.""The boy suspected of committing the stabbing is currently behind detained and investigated on the grounds of premeditated murder.The suspect locked the doors of the classroom during the attack and lunged at his teacher with a kitchen knife.

            Tons of snow raced down a forested slope and smashed into Hotel Rigopiano in the town of Farindola in Italy's central Abruzzo region on Jan. 18, 2017.

            Prosecutors had alleged that local officials and administrators, as well as the hotel’s owner and manager, held various degrees of responsibility in the disaster.











            Italian daily Corriere della Sera said 25 of the 30 defendants were acquitted of all charges, including manslaughter, while five defendants were convicted on relatively lesser charges, such as failure to clear the road for prompt rescue. 

            Shouts of “Shame, shame!” and “Murderers!” exploded from survivors and relatives of the dead in the courtroom in Pescara after the verdicts were read out.

            In Italy, acquittals can be appealed, and it wasn't immediately known whether prosecutors would follow that option.

            Andrea Piccoli, a lawyer for one of the 11 survivors, whose wife was among the dead, told state TV after the verdicts: “The fact that (the avalanche) couldn't be predicted prevailed"" in the court's reasoning. 

            Among those convicted was Farindola's former mayor, who was sentenced to 2 years and 8 months for failing to issue an ordinance to evacuate the hotel and to prevent it from being occupied given its location on a slope susceptible to avalanches, Corriere said.

            Two officials of the province that included the hotel's area were convicted of failing to properly monitor road conditions and remove snow on the road and sentenced to 3 years and 4 months each, Italian media said. Six-month sentences were meted out to a former hotel manager, convicted of making false statements, and to the technical expert who had signed off on work on the canopies and verandas of the hotel, Corriere della Sera said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819815,Hasan and Gurbaz star in Islamabad's big win over Peshawar,"KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) — Fast bowler Hasan Ali grabbed 3-35 and Rahmanullah Gurbaz made 62 off 31 balls in their first game of this season’s Pakistan Super League to spearhead two-time champions Islamabad United's six-wicket victory over Peshawar Zalmi on Thursday.

            Hasan took the wheels off Peshawar’s blazing start with three wickets in the space of eight balls before captain Babar Azam’s unbeaten 75 anchored his team to 156-8.

            Gurbaz capitalized on two dropped catches by James Neesham and raised his half century off 24 balls as Islamabad raced to 159-4 with 31 balls to spare and notched their second win in three games.











            Young Pakistan power-hitter Mohammad Haris (40) and Babar both showed aggression in the batting powerplay as Peshawar motored to 69-0 in the first six overs. Both smashed nine boundaries and two sixes against fast bowlers in the powerplay and didn’t spare Hasan, who conceded 17 in his first over.

            Islamabad captain Shadab Khan broke the threatening stand when Haris scooped a return catch to the leg-spinner as he tried to play against the spin. Peshawar’s new signing Saim Ayub (3) fell for another disappointing knock when he was clean bowled by Mubasir Khan off a sharp googly that uprooted the leg stump of the left-hander.

            Hasan then struck in quick succession by clean bowling Tom Kohler-Cadmore and Rowman Powell in his return over before getting Neesham caught behind off an inside edge as Peshawar slipped to 99-5 in the 12th over.

            Babar couldn’t force the acceleration in the later half the innings as Islamabad fast bowlers allowed only 31 runs in the last five overs.

            Islamabad’s belief in its batting powerhouse paid dividends despite losing by 52 runs in the last game against Multan Sultans. Gurbaz plundered seven boundaries and four sixes as Islamabad romped to 97-1 in the first eight overs.

            Gurbaz was out on a miscued sweep against leg-spinner Usman Qadir, but Rassie van der Dussen (42) and power-hitter Asif Ali (29 not out) finished off the game.

            Islamabad moved into second place with four points. First-place Multan Sultans have eight points from five games.

            Islamabad will face struggling Quetta Gladiators on Friday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819816,"Putin, Afghans among top gift givers to Bidens in 2021","WASHINGTON (AP) — Russia’s president and the deposed leader of Afghanistan were among the top gift givers to President Joe Biden and his family in 2021, according to federal documents published on Thursday.

            In happier times between all three countries, Vladimir Putin gave Biden a $12,000 lacquer writing box and pen when they met at a highly anticipated summit in Geneva, Switzerland in June 2021.

            And, then-Afghan President Mohammed Ashraf Ghani and his wife gave the U.S. president and first lady Jill Biden silk rugs worth an estimated $28,800 later that month. 











            Relations between the U.S. and Russia turned sour shortly after the Geneva meeting and have plummeted since Russia's invasion of Ukraine last February. Ghani, meanwhile, fled Afghanistan shortly after the U.S. withdrew from the country on Biden's orders in August, 2021. 

            Biden also in June received a brass and lapis lazuli jewelry box, worth an estimated $1,150 from Abdullah Abdullah, who was then considered to be the number 2 in the Afghan government. And Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was given a carpet valued at $2,650 in March from Ghani.

            The details were contained in the State Department’s annual accounting of gifts to U.S. officials from world leaders posted on the website of the Federal Register on Thursday. The formal publication of the list, covering 2021, will come on Friday.

            All of the Putin and Ghani gifts were transferred to the National Archives, a requirement for any gift to a U.S. official valued at more than $415. The recipient has the option of paying the estimated value and keeping the gift.

            However, Biden decided to retain, at least for official display, a photograph of the late British monarch Queen Elizabeth II. The photo, in a silver frame was presented to the president on the occasion of a Group of Seven summit in southeast England and is estimated to be worth $2,200.

            According to the records, Putin gave Biden a “Kholuy Lacquer Miniature Workshop Desk Writing Set and Pen” on the occasion of their meeting in Geneva on June 16, 2021. 

            There are no other gifts from Putin or other Russian officials to Biden or U.S. officials documented in the filing.

            Later that month, well after Biden had given the order for American forces to withdraw from Afghanistan in April, Ghani and his wife, Rula, gave Joe and Jill Biden two silk carpets: one valued $9,600 and the other $19,200, according to the list. 

            At the time, U.S. officials believed that Ghani's government and security forces could survive the withdrawal of American troops. A White House statement from Biden's meeting with Ghani on June 25th said that “the U.S. and Afghan leaders firmly agreed that although U.S. troops are leaving Afghanistan, the strong bilateral partnership will continue.”

            In another relationship turned sour, Secretary of State Antony Blinken reported receiving a porcelain vase worth $2,000 from the former foreign policy chief of the Chinese Communist Party, Yang Jiechi. The exchange took place in March, 2021, just two months after the Biden administration took office and the vase is now with the General Services Administration.

            Two years later, the U.S. and China are now at odds on numerous issues ranging from Russia's war in Ukraine to Chinese policies regarding Taiwan, Tibet, the South China Sea, Hong Hong and human rights.WASHINGTON (AP) — Russia’s president and the deposed leader of Afghanistan were among the top gift givers to President Joe Biden and his family in 2021, according to federal documents published on Thursday.In happier times between all three countries, Vladimir Putin gave Biden a $12,000 lacquer writing box and pen when they met at a highly anticipated summit in Geneva, Switzerland in June 2021.And, then-Afghan President Mohammed Ashraf Ghani and his wife gave the U.S. president and first lady Jill Biden silk rugs worth an estimated $28,800 later that month.Relations between the U.S. and Russia turned sour shortly after the Geneva meeting and have plummeted since Russia's invasion of Ukraine last February.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819818,Marseille targets French title as leader PSG pays visit,"PARIS (AP) — Marseille has a genuine chance at winning the French title for the first time since 2010, especially if it beats league leader Paris Saint-Germain at home on Sunday.

            Victory at a packed and vociferous Stade Velodrome stadium against bitter rival PSG would bring second-place Marseille to within two points of the defending champion.

            “The title? Of course we’re thinking about it,” Marseille defender Chancel Mbemba said after the team's victory over Toulouse on Sunday.











            Marseille's tally of 52 points is its best top-flight tally after 24 games. Confidence is growing in coach Igor Tudor's cohesive-looking team, which is facing a bedraggled PSG at just the right time. PSG has lost five of its past 12 games in all competitions.

            They share a record-equaling 10 French titles. But Marseille is the only French club to win the Champions League — in 1993 — and fans love using the expression “Forever the first” to needle PSG.

            “The club is starting to win back its place in the heart of the French (fans),"" former Marseille striker Mamadou Niang, who scored 95 goals in six seasons for the club, told the league website. “People enjoy watching this team play.”

            Marseille has lost just once in the past 14 games, while PSG narrowly avoided a fourth straight defeat last weekend when it trailed Lille at home before winning 4-3.

            A late equalizer from Kylian Mbappé — visibly exasperated by his team's poor defending after Lille's third goal — and a stoppage-time free kick from Lionel Messi may have saved coach Christophe Galtier's job.

            PSG has lost more games already this year under Galtier than all of last year.

            
                Galtier took charge in July after Mauricio Pochettino was fired, becoming PSG's seventh coach in 11 years.

            A dismal 2023 has seen defeats at Lens, Rennes and Monaco in the league, while a 1-0 home defeat to Bayern Munich in the Champions League in the first leg of their round-of-16 game leaves PSG at risk of a second straight exit at this stage of the European tournament.

            “You shouldn’t be scared of playing this PSG side,” Niang said. “Monaco showed that.”

            Tensions are evident among PSG's squad.

            Marquinhos and Neymar argued with sporting director Luis Campos after the Monaco match, and an irate Campos rushed down from the stands during the Lille match.

            Even though Campos previously worked with Galtier at Lille, their relationship is reportedly under strain. In all five defeats, PSG's midfield and defense were overwhelmed when opponents upped the tempo with a strong pressing game — which happens to be Marseille's strength.

            PSG faces Marseille without the injured Neymar, who is sidelined with the latest of many ankle injuries. It will be the 53rd game Neymar has missed with an ankle-related injury since joining in 2017 for a world record 222 million euros ($236 million).

            Plagued by injuries and off-field questions — the mayor of the Paris suburb where Neymar lives recently complained about loud music and parties — Neymar has played only 112 of a possible 214 league games since joining PSG from Barcelona.

            After the Bayern defeat, Mbappé appeared to allude to Neymar when he said all the players had to “eat well, sleep well” before the second leg. The following night, Neymar took part in a poker tournament and was spotted eating in a fast-food outlet in the early hours.

            “I spoke with Neymar and I told him what I thought. He has the right to play poker on his day off, he loves it, Galtier said. ”I told him what I thought of the photo which came out, though. That is absolutely clear.”

            Neymar's fitness was not an issue at Barcelona. The injury-hit Brazil forward hardly missed a game in his previous three seasons before joining PSG.

            Prior to his injury against Lille last Sunday, Neymar had been anonymous in several games — notably against Monaco, Bayern and during a 2-1 French Cup defeat at Marseille two weeks ago.

            Galtier, who is from Marseille and played for the club as a gritty defender, caused confusion when he clenched his fist after Ruslan Malinovskyi scored Marseille's second goal in that game. Some fans saw it as Galtier celebrating but he explained it was a gesture of frustration.

            Galtier has to get his tactics right this time.

            Marseille harried PSG two weeks ago, cutting the supply line from the back, but also faced less of a counter-attacking threat because the World Cup star Mbappé was out injured.

            The France striker showed his devastating speed and finishing with two goals against Lille in his first start after a thigh injury.

            Tudor knows it's a risk playing so high up against PSG, but it's the style of play that has suited Marseille so far.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819819,Anti-logging activist killed in western Mexico,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — Authorities in western Mexico said Thursday they are investigating the killing of an Indigenous anti-logging activist, the latest in a round of murders and disappearances in the region.

            Prosecutors in the violence-plagued state of Michoacan said Alfredo Cisneros was shot to death earlier in the week in the Purepecha Indigenous village of Sicuicho. 

            Cisneros was a local leader and an anti-logging activist, and a member of the community land council. The Indigenous communities of Michoacan have fought for years against mining and illegal logging that target the pine and fir forests of the mountainous region. Loggers often clear-cut trees to plant avocados, a highly lucrative export crop in Michoacan. 











            The killing came just over a month after two community anti-mining activists disappeared in another part of Michoacan. Their bullet-ridden vehicle was found on a roadway. 

            The Supreme Indigenous Council of Michoacan said in a statement that Cisneros “was an untiring defender of the forests, and the collective rights and lands of Sicuicho.”

            The council said he denounced “the illegal logging of pine forests, and fought against the changes in land use that promote the excessive planting of avocados.” It said armed gangs, which it called “paramilitary groups,” have tried to take over communal land and forests.

            For decades, Michoacan was the only state in Mexico authorized to export avocados to the U.S. market, sparking a rush to plant the fruit. A few towns have been able to keep the loggers and avocado orchards out, but they are under constant pressure and threats of violence.

            In other areas where activists have been kidnapped and threatened, like Villa Madero, Michoacan, there are indications that drug cartels may be involved with loggers and illegal avocado orchards.

            Julio Santoyo, an anti-logging activist in Villa Madero, said the state government and growers' associations have promoted avocados as the answer for the state's farmers, increasing hostility toward environmentalists. 

            “We who defend the environment are seen as the enemies of progress and as outcasts who want to block development,” said Santoyo. “The killers who devastate the environment assume they can attack our lives and liberties as a normal thing, with little chance of being punished.”

            The council said Indigenous inhabitants from Cisnero's town had blocked local highways to protest and demand the killers be brought to justice.

            “In Michoacan, impunity and crime reign freely,” the council said.

            As if to underscore that point, prosecutors reported Thursday that gunmen had shot to death six people at a park in the town of Suhuayo, north of Sicuicho. 

            The dead included five men and a woman; the motives remain under investigation, but the area near the neighboring state of Jalisco has been the scene of bloody turf battles between the Jalisco cartel and local gangs.

            Indigenous towns like Sicuicho are also being swept by an Indigenous independence movement, in which they declare themselves autonomous from local township governments.

            While the Council depicts this as an attempt to preserve Purepecha customs and language, many villages do so to get direct access to federal and state funds, without having to go through often corrupt township governments. 

            The killing of Cisneros came just over a month after lawyer Ricardo Lagunes and schoolteacher Antonio Díaz disappeared near the town of Aquila, Michoacan on Feb. 15.

            The two had been active in fighting a massive iron ore mine in the town of Aquila. Inhabitants have long complained the massive open-pit mine caused pollution and drew violence to the area, while offering little benefit to residents. 

            Despite a large-scale search and international pressure to find the two men, there has been no word on their fate.MEXICO CITY (AP) — Authorities in western Mexico said Thursday they are investigating the killing of an Indigenous anti-logging activist, the latest in a round of murders and disappearances in the region.Prosecutors in the violence-plagued state of Michoacan said Alfredo Cisneros was shot to death earlier in the week in the Purepecha Indigenous village of Sicuicho.Cisneros was a local leader and an anti-logging activist, and a member of the community land council.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819820,Jim Harbaugh: Michigan good place to be despite challenges,"ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) — Jim Harbaugh has had an eventful offseason, from interviewing with the Denver Broncos to talking with the NCAA about possible violations in Michigan's football program and firing an assistant coach under investigation by police.

            “Compare us to perfect, and we’re going to come up short in the major areas,” Harbaugh said Thursday in his first remarks to reporters since the season ended. “Compare us to any other program, I think you’re going to see that it doesn’t get any better.”

            A year after saying the door was closed on a return to the NFL, the former San Francisco 49ers coach talked with the Broncos about their vacant coaching job that was later filled by Sean Payton.











            Harbaugh said multiple coaches on his staff had conversations with NFL teams and chose to stay at the school.

            “I’m one of them,” he said. “People do what they think is best for them professionally and personally.”

            There was, though, one coaching change. Co-offensive coordinator Matt Weiss was fired in January after he failed to attend a meeting to discuss whether he had gained access to computer accounts belonging to other people, according to documents released by the school.

            “I don’t really know anything and if I did, I don’t think I could comment on it,” Harbaugh said.

            Shortly after the Wolverines lost 51-45 to TCU in the College Football Playoff semifinals, Michigan announced it received notice that the NCAA is looking into potential rules infractions in the football program.

            The investigation involves impermissible texts and calls — including some by Harbaugh — to high school prospects during part of a pandemic-related dead period for contact with potential recruits. The NCAA also is looking at whether a member of Michigan’s off-field football staff violated rules by doing on-the-field coaching during practice.

            Harbaugh told NCAA investigators in multiple meetings last month that he will not agree to an unethical conduct charge, according to a person familiar with the situation. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because details of the investigation have not been shared publicly.

            Harbaugh told reporters he was unable to comment on the NCAA matter.

            A few hours Harbaugh's news conference to preview spring practice, the Ann Arbor police posted a video on Twitter that showed the coach helping an officer move a fallen tree out of a street during an ice storm the previous night.

            “You're a good man,"" officer Howard Cooper said to Harbaugh.

            “Feel free to spread the word on that,"" Harbaugh said. “Don’t feel like you have to keep that to yourself.”

Co-offensive coordinator Matt Weiss was fired in January after he failed to attend a meeting to discuss whether he had gained access to computer accounts belonging to other people, according to documents released by the school.“I don’t really know anything and if I did, I don’t think I could comment on it,” Harbaugh said.Shortly after the Wolverines lost 51-45 to TCU in the College Football Playoff semifinals, Michigan announced it received notice that the NCAA is looking into potential rules infractions in the football program.The investigation involves impermissible texts and calls — including some by Harbaugh — to high school prospects during part of a pandemic-related dead period for contact with potential recruits. The NCAA also is looking at whether a member of Michigan’s off-field football staff violated rules by doing on-the-field coaching during practice.Harbaugh told NCAA investigators in multiple meetings last month that he will not agree to an unethical conduct charge, according to a person familiar with the situation. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because details of the investigation have not been shared publicly.Harbaugh told reporters he was unable to comment on the NCAA matter.A few hours Harbaugh's news conference to preview spring practice, the Ann Arbor police posted a video on Twitter that showed the coach helping an officer move a fallen tree out of a street during an ice storm the previous night.“You're a good man,"" officer Howard Cooper said to Harbaugh.“Feel free to spread the word on that,"" Harbaugh said. “Don’t feel like you have to keep that to yourself.”___Follow Larry Lage on Twitter at https://twitter.com/larrylage___AP college football: https://apnews.com/hub/college-football and https://twitter.com/ap_top25 Sign up for the AP Top 25 newsletter here: https://link.apnews.com/join/6nr/morning-wire-newsletter-footer-internal-ads",2023/02/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819821,Charges dropped against detainee beaten inside Georgia jail,"SAVANNAH, Ga. (AP) — Prosecutors have dropped charges of assault, obstruction and other counts against a Georgia jail detainee after video from security cameras showed him being beaten by sheriff's deputies who rushed into his cell.

            The decision to dismiss charges against 41-year-old Jarrett Hobbs came several months after an investigation following the video's release in November led to the arrest of three Camden County deputies on battery charges in the jail beating.

            “When the video came out, it was abundantly clear that Mr. Hobbs was not the aggressor,"" Harry Daniels, a civil rights attorney representing Hobbs, said Thursday.











            Daniels said Camden County officials had also agreed to pay Hobbs a “significant monetary settlement” rather than face civil claims in a lawsuit. He declined to give the dollar amount. John Myers, the county's attorney, confirmed a settlement but gave no further details.

            Hobbs of Greensboro, North Carolina, was booked into jail in coastal Camden County for traffic violations and drug possession charges Sept. 3. Later that day, a security camera recorded deputies charging into Hobbs' cell and pushing him against a wall before repeatedly punching him in the head and neck. Another camera recorded Hobbs being hurled against a wall and pinned to the floor.

            Hobbs was charged afterward with aggravated battery, simple assault and obstruction of law enforcement officers. A court filing by prosecutors Tuesday dismissed those charges, citing “insufficient evidence"" against Hobbs. Also dropped were the traffic and drug counts that initially landed Hobbs in jail.

            Brunswick Judicial Circuit District Attorney Keith Higgins had no further comment on the case, said Cheryl Diprizio, his executive assistant.

            Hobbs' beating at the Georgia jail came to light after federal authorities in North Carolina looked into his September arrest. They wanted to determine whether Hobbs had violated his probation stemming from his 2014 guilty plea to a charge of conspiracy to commit bank and wire fraud, according to court records.

            The jail videos were first obtained by Hobbs' attorney in the federal probation case, Daniels said.

            Daniels shared the security videos with reporters in November. Sheriff Jim Proctor ordered an internal investigation more than two months after the beating occurred and Hobbs was the only one charged. Higgins, the district attorney, asked the Georgia Bureau of Investigation to get involved.

            The following week, three Camden County deputies were arrested on charges of battery and violating their oath of office. They were also fired. Two others faced disciplinary action but weren't charged with crimes.

            Hobbs is Black. The three deputies charged are all white, according to Capt. Larry Bruce, the sheriff’s spokesman. 

            Hobbs was returned to federal prison after authorities determined he violated terms of his probation by leaving North Carolina. Daniels said having his charges dismissed in Georgia should improve Hobbs' standing in the federal case. 

            “He's now eligible for release to a halfway house because he no longer has pending charges, which is major,” Daniels said.SAVANNAH, Ga.

(AP) — A person with knowledge of the hiring tells The Associated Press that Sean Payton is bringing back ex-Broncos head coach Vance Joseph to Denver to serve as his defensive coordinator.

            The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the hiring hadn't been announced by the team.

            Two other former NFL head coaches — Rex Ryan and Matt Patricia — also interviewed for the job in recent days.











            Joseph coached the Broncos from 2017-18, compiling an 11-21 record before being replaced by Vic Fangio. He spent the past four seasons as the Arizona Cardinals defensive coordinator.

            Joseph also interviewed for Philadelphia's defensive coordinator vacancy this week after Jonathan Gannon left to serve as the Cardinals head coach following the Super Bowl.

            Payton was hired last month after spending a year in the Fox broadcast studio following his departure from the New Orleans Saints. He replaced Nathaniel Hackett, only the fifth head coach in NFL history not to make it through his first season.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819825,"Pope nationalizes Vatican assets, property in new reform","ROME (AP) — Pope Francis has essentially nationalized all assets and property owned by Vatican departments and affiliated institutions, declaring them to be sovereign patrimony owned by the Holy See and not any individual or office.

            The action outlined in a new law published Thursday marks Francis' latest initiative to centralize Vatican assets so they can be managed properly, following years of mismanagement that led to huge losses and, prosecutors allege, criminal wrongdoing. 

            Francis previously stripped the Vatican’s secretariat of state of its 600 billion-euro ($635 billion) portfolio and ordered the assets transferred to the Vatican’s patrimony office following a scandal involving a 350 million-euro investment in a London property.











            Vatican prosecutors have charged 10 people, including a cardinal, of defrauding the Holy See of tens of millions of euros through the London venture.

            The new law makes clear that the Holy See owns any asset, security or property owned or acquired by a Vatican office or affiliated institution. This “ecclesiastic public property” is “entrusted” to individual departments to use but is destined for the universal needs of the church to fulfill its mission, the law states. 

            In previous stages of Francis’ financial reforms, the Vatican ordered all Vatican offices to submit to standardized annual budgeting and accounting measures. Individual offices, or congregations, were allowed to operate in financial silos before then. 

            The pope also centralized and overhauled the Vatican's investment strategy to ban speculative investments and to prioritize prudent investing in industries that promote the common good.ROME (AP) — Pope Francis has essentially nationalized all assets and property owned by Vatican departments and affiliated institutions, declaring them to be sovereign patrimony owned by the Holy See and not any individual or office.The action outlined in a new law published Thursday marks Francis' latest initiative to centralize Vatican assets so they can be managed properly, following years of mismanagement that led to huge losses and, prosecutors allege, criminal wrongdoing.Francis previously stripped the Vatican’s secretariat of state of its 600 billion-euro ($635 billion) portfolio and ordered the assets transferred to the Vatican’s patrimony office following a scandal involving a 350 million-euro investment in a London property.Vatican prosecutors have charged 10 people, including a cardinal, of defrauding the Holy See of tens of millions of euros through the London venture.The new law makes clear that the Holy See owns any asset, security or property owned or acquired by a Vatican office or affiliated institution.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819838,Trans youth care ban headed to Tennessee governor's desk,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Transgender youth in Tennessee would be banned from receiving gender-affirming care under legislation currently headed to the desk of Republican Gov. Bill Lee, who has voiced support for the bill.

            House lawmakers voted 77-16 on Thursday, with three Democrats joining their Republican colleagues to pass the bill. 

            Civil rights groups have vowed an immediate lawsuit if and when the bill becomes law — setting up the potential for a lengthy legal battle over the coming months. 











            “These children do not need these medical procedures to be able to flourish as adults,” said House Majority Leader William Lamberth. “They need mental health treatment. They need love and support, and many of them need to be able to grow up to become the individuals that they were intended to be.""

            Across the United States, state lawmakers have introduced legislation attacking gender-affirming medical care for young people even as such services have been available in the U.S. for more than a decade and are endorsed by major medical associations.

            Similar bills have advanced in Nebraska, Mississippi, Oklahoma and South Dakota. In Utah, the Republican governor recently signed a transgender medical ban into law. Meanwhile, a federal judge who blocked Arkansas’ ban on gender-affirming care for minors is now considering whether to strike down the law as unconstitutional. A similar ban in Alabama has also been temporarily blocked by a federal judge.

            If enacted in Tennessee, doctors would be prohibited from providing gender-affirming care to anyone under the age of 18, including prescribing puberty blockers and hormones — and could even be penalized.

            However, the legislation spells out exceptions, including allowing doctors to perform these medical services if the patient’s care had begun prior to July 1, 2023 — which is when the ban is proposed to go into effect. The bill then states that that care must end by March 31, 2024.

            The bill then allows the attorney general to investigate health care providers who may violate the statute, which carries a $25,000 penalty. 

            “We have taken away a woman’s right to determine her health care and her health outcomes — and now we’ve gone to children,” said Democratic Rep. Gloria Johnson, referencing the state's strict abortion ban that was allowed to go into effect last year.

            “If a doctor and a family feels that taking hormone blockers is going to be healthy and productive and life-saving for these children, that’s a decision that should be made,” she added.

            Tennessee in particular has been caught in the center of the conflict over transgender youth medical care — ever since video surfaced on social media last year of a Nashville doctor touting that gender-affirming procedures are “huge money makers” for hospitals.

             The video prompted calls by Tennessee’s Republican leaders for an investigation into Vanderbilt University Medical Center, but to date, it’s unknown if any authorities have done so. The private nonprofit hospital said it had provided only a handful of gender-affirming surgeries to minors over the years but has put a temporary pause on the procedures to review its policies. 

            On average, Vanderbilt University Medical Center says it provided five gender-affirming surgeries to minors every year since its transgender clinic opened in 2018. All were over the age of 16 and had parental consent, and none received genital procedures.

            But not every red state has enacted such bans with gusto.

            In Wyoming, a bill stalled in a legislative committee earlier this week amid worries that health insurers would run afoul of federal law by denying coverage for gender-conforming procedures.

            The bill, which had passed the state Senate, failed 5-2 in a House committee after lawmakers removed the insurance coverage prohibition. To succeed now, it would need to be revived on the state House floor before a Monday deadline — a challenging prospect.

            Wyoming, despite having one of the most Republican-dominated legislatures, has a long tradition of skepticism toward culture war bills.

            “It’s a bill that seeks to demonize, it’s a bill that already knows who its enemies are. And it’s not a bill that’s about solving a Wyoming problem,” Sara Burlingame, director of the LGBTQ+ advocacy group Wyoming Equality and a former state lawmaker herself, told the committee.

            Meanwhile, Tennessee's House Republicans on Thursday also advanced legislation that would severely limit where drag shows can take place. A slightly different version had passed the GOP-led Senate chamber earlier this month, meaning lawmakers must wrestle out the difference before it can go to Gov. Lee's desk. 

            Similar to the gender-affirming medical youth care bill, Lee is expected to sign the legislation.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819839,Algeria dissolves pro-democracy group amid wider crackdown,"ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) — Algerian authorities on Thursday dissolved a decades-old pro-democracy group that participated in the peaceful protests which helped force the North African country’s long-time President Abdelaziz Bouteflika from office in 2019.

            The Youth Action Group, known by its French acronym, RAJ, and the left-leaning Movement for Democracy and Socialism party that was also suspended by the same decree, appear to be the latest targets of a crackdown on Algeria's dissenting voices.

            The Algerian Council of State said RAJ was dissolved in line with an October 2021 administrative court decision in favor of an interior ministry lawsuit. The ministry had alleged that the group is “rallying forces to destabilize the country” and conducting other activities that violate a controversial 2012 law on nongovernmental groups. 











            RAJ leaders have repeatedly denied the government’s allegations and said authorities under Bouteflika’s successor, President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, have rolled back on promises to reform the power structure that under Bouteflika was marked by corruption and the ever-present shadow of repression. 

            International human rights organizations have urged Tebboune to scrap the 2012 law adopted by the Bouteflika regime that governs NGO activities — which also covers professional associations. 

            In a joint statement earlier this month, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International said the law is “heavily restrictive and does not conform with international standards on freedom of association.” 

            The two watchdogs also called on Algerian authorities to reverse the decision to dissolve the Algerian League for the Defense of Human Rights, or LADDH, and “end their general crackdown on independent civil society organizations.” 

            The Administrative Court of Algiers dissolved LADDH in June 2022 following a complaint filed by the interior ministry, the organization said in January after reading the verdict on its fate on the internet. 

            On Wednesday, the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime, or GI-TOC said in a statement that one of its researchers in Algeria, Raouf Farrah, was arrested and charged in court “with spreading information from classified documents.” 

            The organization said Farrah and his 67-year-old father who was also detained, were arraigned alongside seven others in the northeastern city of Constantine in an overnight hearing Feb. 20. Raouf Farrah was also charged with “receiving funds for the purpose of committing acts to disturb public order,” the organization said, and called the charges “completely baseless.”

            “There is nothing classified or harmful to the Algerian state in (Farrah’s widely) published research,” the organization said and urged authorities to release him.ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) — Algerian authorities on Thursday dissolved a decades-old pro-democracy group that participated in the peaceful protests which helped force the North African country’s long-time President Abdelaziz Bouteflika from office in 2019.The Youth Action Group, known by its French acronym, RAJ, and the left-leaning Movement for Democracy and Socialism party that was also suspended by the same decree, appear to be the latest targets of a crackdown on Algeria's dissenting voices.The Algerian Council of State said RAJ was dissolved in line with an October 2021 administrative court decision in favor of an interior ministry lawsuit.

Raouf Farrah was also charged with “receiving funds for the purpose of committing acts to disturb public order,” the organization said, and called the charges “completely baseless.”“There is nothing classified or harmful to the Algerian state in (Farrah’s widely) published research,” the organization said and urged authorities to release him.",2023/02/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819840,"Hungary to send delegation to Sweden, Finland over NATO bids","BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — Hungary plans to send a delegation to Sweden and Finland to resolve “political disputes” that have raised doubts among some Hungarian lawmakers of whether to support the two Nordic nations' applications to join NATO, a senior Hungarian lawmaker said Thursday. 

            Mate Kocsis, the head of the nationalist Fidesz party's parliamentary caucus, said during a news briefing that a “serious debate” had emerged within the caucus over the NATO accession of Sweden and Finland, according to state news agency MTI.

            Some ruling party lawmakers, he said, resented that “politicians from these countries have insulted Hungary in a crude, unfounded and often vulgar manner in recent years, and now they are asking for a favor.”











            A parliamentary delegation will travel to Sweden and Finland seeking to clarify their positions, Kocsis said. The trip was not expected to delay the Hungarian parliament’s debate, set to begin next week, on ratifying the NATO applications, he said. 

            Hungary is the only NATO member country besides Turkey that has not yet approved Sweden and Finland's bids to join the Western military alliance. The northern European neighbors dropped their long-standing military neutrality and sought NATO membership in May in response to Russia's war in Ukraine.

            A unanimous vote of all 30 NATO members is needed to admit new countries.

            Hungary’s parliament was expected to vote on letting Finland and Sweden join NATO late last year. But the process was delayed several times by what the government said was a crowded parliamentary agenda as lawmakers voted on legislation aimed at releasing billions in frozen European Union funding. 

            Kocsis said Thursday that Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban was committed to admitting the two countries but that some in his Fidesz party were divided, with some arguing that NATO's expansion “could represent an escalation in the existing conflict.”

            ""Fundamentally, we are committed to maintaining, enlarging and strengthening both NATO and the European community,” Kocsis said. 

            Earlier this month, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto defended Turkey’s refusal to ratify Sweden’s NATO bid, saying that Stockholm should “act differently” if it wanted to secure Ankara’s backing.BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — Hungary plans to send a delegation to Sweden and Finland to resolve “political disputes” that have raised doubts among some Hungarian lawmakers of whether to support the two Nordic nations' applications to join NATO, a senior Hungarian lawmaker said Thursday.Mate Kocsis, the head of the nationalist Fidesz party's parliamentary caucus, said during a news briefing that a “serious debate” had emerged within the caucus over the NATO accession of Sweden and Finland, according to state news agency MTI.Some ruling party lawmakers, he said, resented that “politicians from these countries have insulted Hungary in a crude, unfounded and often vulgar manner in recent years, and now they are asking for a favor.”A parliamentary delegation will travel to Sweden and Finland seeking to clarify their positions, Kocsis said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819842,UN approves resolution calling for Russia to leave Ukraine,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The U.N. General Assembly approved a nonbinding resolution Thursday that calls for Russia to end hostilities in Ukraine and withdraw its forces, sending a strong message on the eve of the first anniversary of the invasion that Moscow's aggression must stop.

            The resolution, drafted by Ukraine in consultation with its allies, passed 141-7, with 32 abstentions. 

            Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said the vote was more evidence that not only the West backs his country.











            “This vote defies the argument that the global south does not stand on Ukraine’s side,"" Kuleba said. ""Many countries representing Latin America, Africa, Asia voted in favor.”

            U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan called the vote “an overwhelming demonstration of support for Ukraine — and a clear defense of freedom for people everywhere.""

            The General Assembly has become the most important U.N. body dealing with Ukraine because the Security Council, which is charged with maintaining international peace and security, is paralyzed by Russia’s veto power. General Assembly resolutions are not legally binding, unlike Security Council resolutions, but serve as a barometer of world opinion.

            The seven countries voting against Thursday's resolution were Belarus, Nicaragua, Russia, Syria, North Korea, Eritrea and Mali, which has developed close military ties with Russia. Amendments proposed by Belarus would have stripped much of the language but were resoundingly defeated.

            The vote was slightly below the highest total for the five previous resolutions approved by the 193-member world body since Russia sent troops and tanks across the border into its smaller neighbor on Feb. 24, 2022. That tally, in an October resolution against Russia’s illegal annexations, won approval by 143 countries.

            Foreign ministers and diplomats from more than 75 countries addressed the assembly during two days of debate, with many urging support for the resolution that upholds Ukraine’s territorial integrity, a basic principle of the U.N. Charter that all countries must subscribe to when they join the world organization. 

            The war has killed tens of thousands on both sides and has reduced entire Ukrainian cities to ruins and its impact has been felt worldwide in higher food and fuel costs and rising inflation.

            Venezuela’s deputy ambassador addressed the council on behalf of 16 countries that either voted against or abstained on almost all of five previous resolutions on Ukraine: Belarus, Bolivia, Cambodia, China, Cuba, Eritrea, Equatorial Guinea, Iran, Laos, Mali, Nicaragua, North Korea, St. Vincent, Syria, Venezuela and Zimbabwe.

            While other countries focused on Russia’s actions, Venezuelan Deputy Ambassador Joaquín Pérez Ayestarán said Wednesday that all countries without exception “must stringently comply with the United Nations Charter,” a barely veiled dig at an international order long dominated by the U.S. and Europe, and at what some call violations of the charter.

            Ayestarán said the countries in his group were against what he called divisive action in the General Assembly, and for “a spirit of compromise.”

            European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell told reporters that the aggressor and the victim can’t be put on equal terms. But China’s deputy U.N. ambassador, Dai Bing, told the assembly Thursday: “We support Russia and Ukraine in moving towards each other. ... The international community should make joint efforts to facilitate peace talks.”

            China says it is neutral in the conflict and an advocate of peace talks, but has not criticized the invasion or described it as such. Beijing has condemned the U.S. and its allies over sanctions on Moscow and military assistance to Ukraine. China and Russia have increasingly aligned their foreign policies to oppose the U.S.-led international order.

            Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi reaffirmed the strength of those ties when he met Russian leader Vladimir Putin during a visit to Moscow this week.

            More broadly, Russia and Ukraine have been trying to win support from around the world.

            The head of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s presidential office, Andriy Yermak, spoke Tuesday about the U.N. resolution with India's national security adviser because “Ukraine is interested in the broadest possible support for the resolution, in particular from the countries of the global south,” a statement from Zelenskyy’s office said.

            India had a Cold War dependence on the Soviet Union and has abstained several times from voting on U.N. Security Council resolutions demanding that Russia cease its invasion.

            Less-powerful countries, including many in Africa, also have been caught up in the diplomatic wrangling.

            “We were colonized, and we forgive those who colonized us. Now the colonizers are asking us to be enemies with Russia, who never colonized us; is that fair?” Uganda’s foreign minister, Abubaker Jeje Odongo, told the Sputnik news agency this month.

            Russia is Africa’s top arms supplier and Odongo also noted that most of his country’s military equipment is Russian-made. 

            “Countries in Africa have traditionally been attached in the Cold War division to the Soviet Union, having the old nostalgia, but also Russia has good tools, how to motivate them to be on their side,” Slovak Foreign Minister Rastislav Káčer told reporters in New York on Thursday. “And then there are others, like China, who are big powers, and are very carefully following what’s going on, and calculating what’s good for them.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819843,Northern border immigrant death highlights crossing spike,"The death of a Mexican man who had just entered the United States from Canada illegally is highlighting the spike in illegal crossings along the border between Quebec and parts of New England, officials say.

            The number of illegal border crossers is tiny compared with those entering the country illegally from Mexico, but the death of the man who entered Vermont from Quebec late Sunday marked the area’s first death in recent memory of someone who crossed into the U.S. illegally. His entry took place in an area near Derby Line about 50 miles (80 kilometers) southeast of Montreal.

            There have been fatalities of people seeking to cross on the Canadian side of the border. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police, which is responsible for border security in Canada, report their agents have mounted a number of search and rescue operations this winter in the region of people intending to cross into the United States from Canada.











            Border officials on both sides of the line have been warning about the dangers to the crossers and those who could be sent to rescue them. 

            Last year, a family of four Indian nationals died of exposure in Manitoba near its border with Minnesota and North Dakota. In December, a 44-year-old Haitian citizen who had been trying to enter the United States illegally from Canada was found dead in a wooded area near St-Bernard-de-Lacolle, Quebec, not far from Champlain, New York, about 35 miles (56 kilometers) south of Montreal. In April 2019, a Dominican man also died in Canada not far from Champlain.

            “As we progress deeper into winter and continue to address the ongoing pace of illicit cross-border traffic, the level of concern for the lives and welfare of our Border Patrol Agents and those we are encountering — particularly vulnerable populations — continues to climb,” the Border Patrol's Sector Chief Patrol Agent Robert Garcia said in a news release this month before the death of the immigrant in Vermont.

            RCMP spokeswoman Cpl. Tasha Adams said agents were involved in at least three search and rescue operations in January, including one the weekend of Jan. 28, when the family of a person seeking to cross into the United States called Canadian authorities from the U.S. to report they had lost contact with him in an area just north of the border. 

            Rescuers later found the man in the Mansonville, Quebec, a short distance west of Derby Line, after tracking him for about 90 minutes through deep snow. He was conscious but suffering from hypothermia and frostbite.

            “These are situations that place our officers at risk because of the weather and terrain they trek through to locate these individuals in distress,"" Adams said in an email. 

            Statistics from U.S. Customs and Border Protection show that agents in the sector that includes New Hampshire, Vermont and parts of upstate New York apprehended 1,513 illegal border crossers between Oct. 1, 2022 through Jan. 31, 2023, up from 160 in the same period the year before. But the total number apprehended along the entire northern border this fiscal year, 2,227, is a small fraction of those apprehended along the U.S.-Mexican border during that same period, 762,383.

            Nevertheless, federal court documents filed in some of the northern border crossing cases in Vermont describe people who legally enter Canada where they pay people to take them to the border. Once they cross into the U.S., they then meet with someone else who takes them deeper into the country.

            In the Feb. 19 case that led to the Mexican man's death, court records say Border Patrol agents were notified just before 11 p.m. after a surveillance camera detected possible illegal border crossers in the town of Holland, about 2 miles (3.25 kilometers) east of Derby Line. 

            Responding agents spotted three men standing by the side of the road about a half-mile (1 kilometer) from the border. Two ran back toward Canada while the third collapsed. He was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. No cause of death has been released, but the Vermont State Police say the death is not considered suspicious.

            At around the same time and a short distance away, Border Patrol agents stopped a car with Connecticut license plates and arrested the passenger and charged her with human smuggling. The woman told agents she had been paid $600 to pick up people she did not know at a hotel, which she could not name.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819846,California AG opens civil rights probe into sheriff's office,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — The California attorney general on Thursday opened a civil rights investigation into the Riverside County Sheriff's Office, one of the largest law enforcement agencies in Southern California, after deaths in county jails hit a two-decade high last year and other allegations of excessive use of force surfaced.

            Attorney General Rob Bonta announced the investigation in Los Angeles following what he called “deeply concerning” allegations of misconduct within the sheriff's office and confinement conditions at the sheriff's jails. He did not give examples.

            While Bonta said no specific incidents were a tipping point to prompt the civil rights investigation, there have been patterns in data — including disparate impacts on communities of color — that, in his words, have been ""disturbing for some time.” 











            Exact figures on in-custody deaths, use of force incidents and misconduct allegations were not immediately available from his office Tuesday.

            “It is time for us to shine a light on the Riverside County Sheriff’s Office and its practices,” he said during a news conference.

            Bonta called the status of the trust between the department and the public “in peril"" and alluded to the recent line-of-duty deaths of two Riverside deputies in shootings that rocked the county.

            “Ensuring public trust and keeping our communities and officers safe is not mutually exclusive,” Bonta said.

            Sheriff Chad Bianco, in a video response posted online, called the investigation “a political stunt” and said Bonta, a Democrat, was bowing to anti-law enforcement activists' demands.

            “This will prove to be a complete waste of time and resources,” said Bianco, a Republican. 

            In 2021, the Southern California chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union sent a letter to the attorney general's office urging the state to investigate the Riverside department for what it called “its racist policing practices, rampant patrol and jail deaths, and its refusal to comply"" with court orders.

            The attorney general has the power to open civil investigations to determine whether a law enforcement agency has “engaged in a pattern or practice” of violating state or federal law. These cases are not criminal in nature and are meant to identify potential problems and then work with the agency to correct the issues, which are typically systemic violations of a community's constitutional rights.

            The state agency has similar cases open into the Santa Clara County Sheriff’s Office and the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department. Those probes are ongoing.LOS ANGELES (AP) — The California attorney general on Thursday opened a civil rights investigation into the Riverside County Sheriff's Office, one of the largest law enforcement agencies in Southern California, after deaths in county jails hit a two-decade high last year and other allegations of excessive use of force surfaced.Attorney General Rob Bonta announced the investigation in Los Angeles following what he called “deeply concerning” allegations of misconduct within the sheriff's office and confinement conditions at the sheriff's jails. He did not give examples.While Bonta said no specific incidents were a tipping point to prompt the civil rights investigation, there have been patterns in data — including disparate impacts on communities of color — that, in his words, have been ""disturbing for some time.”Exact figures on in-custody deaths, use of force incidents and misconduct allegations were not immediately available from his office Tuesday.“It is time for us to shine a light on the Riverside County Sheriff’s Office and its practices,” he said during a news conference.Bonta called the status of the trust between the department and the public “in peril"" and alluded to the recent line-of-duty deaths of two Riverside deputies in shootings that rocked the county.“Ensuring public trust and keeping our communities and officers safe is not mutually exclusive,” Bonta said.Sheriff Chad Bianco, in a video response posted online, called the investigation “a political stunt” and said Bonta, a Democrat, was bowing to anti-law enforcement activists' demands.“This will prove to be a complete waste of time and resources,” said Bianco, a Republican.In 2021, the Southern California chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union sent a letter to the attorney general's office urging the state to investigate the Riverside department for what it called “its racist policing practices, rampant patrol and jail deaths, and its refusal to comply"" with court orders.The attorney general has the power to open civil investigations to determine whether a law enforcement agency has “engaged in a pattern or practice” of violating state or federal law. These cases are not criminal in nature and are meant to identify potential problems and then work with the agency to correct the issues, which are typically systemic violations of a community's constitutional rights.The state agency has similar cases open into the Santa Clara County Sheriff’s Office and the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819847,Part of mall parking garage collapses in suburban Milwaukee,"MADISON, Wis. (AP) — A section of a suburban Milwaukee shopping mall parking garage collapsed Thursday. Two cars were damaged, but no injuries were reported, authorities said.

            News outlets tweeted and broadcast footage showing a section of the top two floors of the three-story garage at Bayshore Mall in Glendale laying on the first floor. A mound of snow covered the rubble.

            North Shore Fire/Rescue Chief Robert Whitaker told reporters during a question-and-answer session at the scene that he was “fairly confident"" no one was hurt after authorities spoke with the owners of the two damaged cars. The chief said firefighters would continue to search the snow mound to be sure no one is trapped.











            Glendale Mayor Bryan Kennedy told The Associated Press in a telephone interview that fire and rescue crews viewed mall surveillance video and it showed no one in the area for 15 to 20 minutes before the collapse. About two dozen empty cars remain stuck on the portion of the second and third floors with no way for the owners to maneuver around the gaping hole the collapse left, the mayor said.

            “No loss of life, (but) unfortunately it's just a big old mess,” Kennedy said. 

            Whitaker told reporters at the scene that it appears snow had been piled on the third floor and the extra weight may have played a role in the collapse. The mall and garage was built in 2005 and 2006, Kennedy said.

            The Milwaukee area has received about 23. 7 inches of snow since December, including 1.5 inches of wet sleet on Wednesday, according to the National Weather Service.

            “I don’t know why (the garage collapsed), but it appears snow would have some likely impact,” the chief said. “Piling snow on a property, especially if its elevated, probably not a good idea.”

            Darius Fox, an employee at Rocky Rococo pizza in an adjacent building, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel newspaper that the collapse sounded “like a bomb.” 

            “It shook the whole building,” Fox said. “It's just a shock because nothing usually happens out here like that.”

            A slab of concrete fell from a parking garage in Milwaukee in June 2010, killing 15-year-old Jared Kellner and injuring two other people. A Milwaukee County jury ruled four years later that the insurance company for the firm that installed the panel owed $39 million in connection with the incident.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819848,Push returns for South Carolina to add hate crime law,"COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — A Democratic lawmaker who called the late pastor of Emanuel AME Church a friend is continuing his push to make South Carolina the 49th state with a hate crime law.

            After an avowed white supremacist murdered nine members of the oldest African Methodist Episcopal church in the U.S. South in 2015, Rep. Wendell Gilliard revamped his ongoing pursuit of enhanced state penalties for hate crimes.

            Before adjourning that summer, lawmakers provided a special session might allow them to stiffen punishments for crimes motivated by bias against particular groups. But no such proposal has become law in the years since.











            The measure took its first steps this year when a House subcommittee unanimously advanced the bill Thursday. Gilliard told lawmakers that it brings “no pleasure” to discuss the issue every year. For Gilliard, the debate recalls memories of the attack on churchgoers he knew in the district where he was raised.

            “It's a weight to carry,"" Gilliard told The Associated Press. “But you know you have to do it.”

            South Carolina and Wyoming are the only two states without a hate crime statute.

            The proposal is named after Clementa C. Pinckney, the former state senator and pastor who died in the racist Charleston massacre. The bill would allow harsher punishments for perpetrators of violent crimes motivated by their perception of someone’s race, color, religion, sex, gender, national origin, sexual orientation, or physical or mental disability. Additional fines no more than $10,000 and up to five years imprisonment could be imposed for anyone convicted.

            The House approved a similar bill two years ago with bipartisan support. But the endeavor stalled in the Senate at the behest of eight Republicans who blocked debate.

            Some opponents have said a state law is unnecessary when a federal statute already protects the listed groups. They point to the example of the Charleston shooter, who has sat on death row for six years after becoming the first person sentenced to death for a federal hate crime.

            Gilliard said state laws are necessary amid a federal backlog. A July 2021 Department of Justice report found that U.S. attorneys declined to prosecute 82% of hate crime suspects from 2005 to 2019. 

            While the mass shooting in Charleston has provided increased impetus, many hate crimes draw less attention. The existence of a state law, according to Gilliard, can determine whether police collect evidence for a hate crime.

            “Without a hate crime law, we can't keep records,” Gilliard said. “We don't know where the hot spots are.”

            Recent FBI statistics show South Carolina had 110 hate crimes in 2020 — nearly double the 57 instances reported the previous year.

            Others objected to the inclusion of gender and sexuality in previous bills. A House subcommittee axed protections for gay and transgender people in 2021 after a Republican leader said their inclusion would likely lead members of the majority party to withdraw support. Conservative opponents have said they fear a hate crime law could be used to prosecute Christians who speak out against gay marriage.

            Gilliard said Thursday that he would not compromise on the inclusion of gender and sexuality as protected identities.

            Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey had no comment Thursday on the likelihood that the upper chamber passes this year's bill.

            The state's powerful business community threw its weight behind the 2021 effort. Industry leaders argued the lack of a hate crime law could hurt South Carolina's recruitment and retention of businesses. Tyler Prescott, CEO of the Upstate SC LGBT+ Chamber of Commerce, said the protections are both the “right thing to do” and necessary for economic competitiveness.

            Some major companies were back at the statehouse Thursday to support the legislation. Duke Energy, one of South Carolina's largest employers, backed Gilliard's bill.

            Other backers included the Charleston Jewish Federation. Brandon Fish, the group's director of community relations, asked lawmakers to address the heightened impact of crimes motivated by hate.

            “Spray painting a happy face on a playground is vandalism,” Fish said. “Spray painting a swastika on a synagogue is also vandalism, but the effect is different. It has the effect of scaring people — an entire community.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819849,German mayor strikes deal to stop group's climate roadblocks,"BERLIN (AP) — The German city of Hannover has reached an agreement with climate activists to stop blocking roads, after its mayor announced Thursday that he supports several of their demands.

            Mayor Belit Onay said he held talks with representatives from the group Last Generation in recent days to stop them gluing themselves to roads — a tactic that has enraged many motorists. The group says its goal is to highlight the need for tougher action against global warming but the protests have sparked fierce criticism among some in Germany who say they're dangerous and harm the climate cause.

            “At times the situation here was extremely close to tipping point,” Onay told The Associated Press. “There were some very confrontational situations with a lot of anger on the roads during such blockades.”











            “That's why I wanted to resolve this and not let it escalate further,” he said.

            In a letter to senior German lawmakers posted on his Instagram account, Onay said he supports the group's call for a general speed limit on national highways, a measure that experts say would considerably reduce greenhouse gas emissions from cars at little cost. He also backed a system of public transport fares that would be even cheaper than the 49 euro ($52) monthly ticket agreed last year.

            The Hannover mayor said he disagrees with the group's demands for citizens' assemblies that would have the power to legislate national climate action, but that he supports creating such bodies to advise parliaments.

            In a statement, Last Generation said it has agreed to stop its protests in Hannover in response to Onay's letter, the first city where such an agreement has been reached.

            Onay, a former Green party lawmaker who has led the city of more than 500,000 inhabitants since 2019, said further talks would depend on the activists sticking to their side of the bargain.

            “I made clear that we won't allow ourselves to be blackmailed and we won't accept an ultimatum,” he told The AP. “If we are to have a conversation then it can only be without protests.”BERLIN (AP) — The German city of Hannover has reached an agreement with climate activists to stop blocking roads, after its mayor announced Thursday that he supports several of their demands.Mayor Belit Onay said he held talks with representatives from the group Last Generation in recent days to stop them gluing themselves to roads — a tactic that has enraged many motorists.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819850,Alabama faces questions after more details on fatal shooting,"No. 2 Alabama is one of the top teams in the country and a favorite to win the national championship. 

            It is also facing intense scrutiny over three players' alleged involvement in the deadly shooting of Jamea Harris near campus early on Jan. 15. One-time reserve forward Darius Miles and another man are charged with capital murder. 

            And while Crimson Tide star Brandon Miller's name has surfaced in official testimony as a potential witness and as a person who allegedly brought a gun to Miles, he has not been charged — and there's no indication he will be. Police have said another player, guard Jaden Bradley, also was at the scene. 











            Despite this week's new testimony and details in court, Alabama has so far kept up its winning ways. Here is what to know about the case as March Madness approaches.

            WHAT HAPPENED?

            Miles, who was swiftly dismissed from the team, and Michael Davis face capital murder charges for the shooting death of 23-year-old Harris. Tuscaloosa Police investigator Brandon Culpepper testified Tuesday that Miles texted Miller to bring him his gun and that Miles did so. Bradley was also at the scene, police said, and Miller's and Bradley's cars blocked the one Harris was in.

            An attorney for Miller said his client never handled or saw the gun and wasn’t involved in getting it into the hands of Davis, who is accused of pulling the trigger. Miller's attorney also said Miller's car didn't block the one Harris was in. It wasn't immediately clear whether Bradley had an attorney.

            WHO WAS JAMEA HARRIS? 

            Harris was from the Birmingham area and a mother of a 5-year-old son. Harris' mother, DeCarla Heard, told WBRC in Tuscaloosa this week that Jamea Harris was “high-spirited, always the life of the party.”

            “She was just always excited to be around family and friends and just have a good time,” Heard said. “She was a great person. She was a great mother to her son.”

            Harris was killed early on a Sunday morning on the Strip, a popular student hangout near campus that features bars and restaurants. According to Miller’s attorney, as reported by AL.com, Miles, Davis and Harris were all at a nightclub, and Miles and someone with Harris “apparently exchanged words.”

            Harris' stepfather, Kelvin Heard, told AL.com that “this season is stained in Jamea's blood ... Coach Oats crossed the line (Tuesday). He said they prayed at practice. They weren't praying for Jamea. They were praying for their own players.”

            WHERE DID THE GUN COME FROM?

            The gun belonged to Miles and had been left in the back seat of Miller’s car, according to Miller's attorney. Police say Miles did not fire the shots. 

            HOW HAS ALABAMA REACTED? 

            Alabama kicked Miles off the team and removed him from school shortly after the shootings. A day after Miles was charged, coach Nate Oats said the team was going through “kind of a grieving process.”

            The university and Oats said Miller is a cooperating witness and isn’t considered a suspect. The school said the decision to keep playing him is “based on all the facts that we have gathered.” 

            Oats walked back a comment from Tuesday, when he said Miller was in “the wrong place at the wrong time,” and apologized again in Wednesday's postgame remarks for his choice of words.

            “I’m not here to make excuses, but I want to make it clear that I didn’t have the details from the hearing that morning since I was coming straight from practice,” Oats said. “I used a poor choice of words making it appear like I wasn’t taking this tragedy seriously, which we have throughout the course of it. I sincerely apologize for that.”

            WILL MILLER FACE CHARGES? 

            Tuscaloosa's chief deputy district attorney, Paula Whitley, told AL.com regarding possible charges for Miller: ""There’s nothing we could charge him with.”

            Birmingham defense attorney Richard Jaffe told The Associated Press that prosecutors would have to prove that Miller knew a crime would occur, and Jaffe hasn’t seen anything to indicate that he had knowledge or intent.

            “Without the element of knowledge and intent provable, there’s not really any way legally that he can be held accountable,” said Jaffe, a former Tuscaloosa prosecutor who is not involved in the case. “People cannot be held accountable for someone else’s actions unless they know what they are and intend that criminal activity occur, specifically in this case that a weapon will be used."" 

            WHAT’S NEXT

            The case against Miles and Davis will go to a grand jury for a potential indictment, and their request for bond was denied. 

            On the court, Alabama is leading the Southeastern Conference and is a likely No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament, barring late-season struggles. The SEC Tournament runs March 8-12.

            Miller hasn’t missed a beat — or a start — for the Tide, even delivering his best game of the season on Wednesday at South Carolina with a career-high 41 points and the game-winning shot in overtime. 

            No players have been made available to the media since Tuesday’s testimony that mentioned Miller and Bradley.

            Swiatek, who reached the last four in a walkover after Karolina Pliskova withdrew because of an illness, is 5-0 against Gauff and beat the 18-year-old American in last year's French Open final. Gauff is yet to win a set against the three-time Grand Slam champion.

            The fifth-seeded Gauff relied on her steady serve and capitalized on Keys' mistakes in their all-American quarterfinal match. Keys committed 51 unforced errors.











            Barbora Krejcikova upset second-ranked Aryna Sabalenka 0-6, 7-6 (2), 6-1. Sabalenka, the Australian Open champion, was on a 13-match winning streak and led 3-1 in the second set before Krejcikova's comeback. It was Sabalenka's first loss this season.

            Krejcikova, the 2021 French Open champion, will face Jessica Pegula of the United States in the semifinals. Pegula, who is ranked No. 3, advanced by a walkover after Karolina Muchova withdrew because of an abdominal injury.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819853,Twins finalize 1-year deal with vet infielder Donovan Solano,"FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) — Infielder Donovan Solano finalized a $2 million, one-year contract on Thursday with the Minnesota Twins, who added another productive and versatile player to an already deep bench.

            The deal was agreed to on Tuesday and completed after Solano took a physical on Thursday. He can earn an additional $250,000 in performance bonuses for plate appearances: $25,000 each for 325 and 375, $50,000 for 425 and $75,000 apiece for 475 and 502.

            Solano hit .284 with 16 doubles and four home runs last season in 80 games for Cincinnati, playing mostly first base. He spent three years with San Francisco prior to that, winning a Silver Slugger award for National League second basemen in the pandemic-shortened 2020 season when he batted .326 with a career-best .828 OPS in 54 games. 











            Solano has primarily been a second baseman, with experience also at third base and shortstop. He'll give the Twins additional infield depth along with another former Reds player, Kyle Farmer, who will also be in the mix as a backup corner outfielder. Nick Gordon, who is Minnesota's most versatile player, is firmly in that reserve pool, too.

            “It’s just fair to say we’ll take literally as many good players as we can get,” manager Rocco Baldelli told reporters Wednesday.

            Solano, who picked up the nickname “Donnie Barrels” for his consistent ability to send line drives to all parts of the field, will be counted on to provide another productive right-handed batter for a roster that could use more of them beyond stars Byron Buxton, Carlos Correa and Jose Miranda. Solano will also give Baldelli another option as a designated hitter, where Solano took a turn 26 times for the Reds in 2022.

            “The sooner I get my at-bats, the sooner I stay in the lineup, I’m happy. Sometimes, I want to be on defense and play the field, but if there’s opportunities like that to DH, I’ll be happy and I’ll be wanting to contribute to the team,” Solano told reporters after arriving at spring training.

            Stuck in Triple-A with the New York Yankees system in 2017 and the Los Angeles Dodgers system in 2018, Solano went 2 1/2 years between major league at-bats before catching on with the Giants.

            “I knew I had to change something, outside baseball things, with God, with my prayers, with everything inside me. That helped me,” Solano said. “I think God helped me involving everything with my business, in my career. I changed my hitting success after doing that decision.”

            The 35-year-old, a native of Colombia, made his major league debut with Miami in 2012. He’s a .278 hitter with 27 home runs in 686 games.

            To make room on the 40-man roster, the Twins placed right-handed pitcher Chris Paddack on the 60-day injured list. Paddack will miss most of the season while recovering from Tommy John surgery on his right elbow. The ulnar collateral ligament injury limited Paddack to five starts in his Twins debut last year.

            McEnroe will lead Team World against Borg’s Team Europe at Rogers Arena in Vancouver from Sept. 22-24.

            The only player named to either six-man roster so far is Felix Auger-Aliassime, a 22-year-old from Montreal who is currently No. 9 in the ATP rankings. His best Grand Slam result was reaching the semifinals at the 2021 U.S. Open.











            Auger-Aliassime helped begin the comeback on Day 3 of the Laver Cup in London last September — marked by Roger Federer’s final match, a doubles loss alongside longtime rival Rafael Nadal — when Team World finally beat Team Europe after losing each of the initial four editions of the event.

            Auger-Aliassime paired with Jack Sock to win a doubles match, then beat Novak Djokovic in singles, before Frances Tiafoe’s victory over Stefanos Tsitsipas clinched the outcome.

            “Felix was our MVP last year. He really turned the tide for us, big time,” McEnroe said in a video press conference on Thursday. “It’s a no-brainer to have Felix on the team. I think he’s going to win a major in the next year — 18 months at the most.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819855,Nigeria presses ahead with vote amid cash shortage crisis,"ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — Nigeria's election commission said Thursday it now has received much of the cash it needs to carry out this weekend’s elections, dismissing concerns that the vote would be postponed because of the country's banknote crisis.

            Meanwhile, though, Nigerians continued to line up at banks across Africa's most populous nation, unable to withdraw their money. The shortages fueled fears that voters could have trouble getting to their polling stations on Saturday. 

            Authorities have in the past delayed Nigeria's last two presidential elections, but the Independent National Electoral Commission said Thursday that election materials and staffers were being deployed to more than 175,000 voting units across Nigeria.











            “I want to assure Nigerians that we are adequately prepared for this election,"" INEC chairman Mahmood Yakubu said at a news conference in the capital, Abuja.

            Still, he noted that 6.2 million eligible voters had not picked up their voting cards in time for Saturday's vote.

            Hussaini Abdu with YIAGA Africa, a nonprofit group promoting electoral reforms in Nigeria, feared people could have difficulties getting to polling stations on Saturday or lose interest altogether.

            “The growing discontent among citizens may lead to voter apathy in the form of protest, which will eventually lead to low voter turnouts,” Abdu said.

            Nigerian voters are to choose a new president on Saturday from a field of 18 candidates following the second and final term of incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari. 

            Three front-runners have emerged, including the ruling party’s Bola Tinubu and the main opposition’s Atiku Abubakar. Peter Obi, a third-party hopeful who has been favored in most polls, has broken the usual cycle of two-candidate races.

            In a tweet Thursday, Buhari urged election officials and security agencies “to be firm and courageous, and to abide by the laws and constitutional provisions in conducting the elections.”

            Authorities announced in November that they were replacing Nigeria's currency, the naira, with new, redesigned notes for the first time in nearly two decades. But with the change coming just before the election, everyone from vendors to government officials have struggled to have enough money on hand in a country still heavily dependent on its cash economy.

            On Thursday, the election commission also sought to reassure Nigerians that the country’s security challenges were being addressed as well.

            Observers have expressed concerns about the safety of voters and election workers, particularly in the north where thousands have died in the last year because of violence linked to Islamic extremists and banditry.

            Violence directed at polling stations in the southeast where separatists are active also has created unease about the vote. 

            A senate candidate for the Labour Party was burned to death by gunmen, police said Thursday, the latest in a spiral of violence that analysts fear could affect voter turnout.ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — Nigeria's election commission said Thursday it now has received much of the cash it needs to carry out this weekend’s elections, dismissing concerns that the vote would be postponed because of the country's banknote crisis.Meanwhile, though, Nigerians continued to line up at banks across Africa's most populous nation, unable to withdraw their money.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819856,"Alec Baldwin pleads not guilty in shooting, can still work","Actor Alec Baldwin has pleaded not guilty to felony charges of involuntary manslaughter in the shooting death of a cinematographer on the set of a Western movie and waived his first formal court appearance, in court documents filed Thursday.

            Baldwin and a weapons supervisor were charged last month with felony involuntary manslaughter in the shooting death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, who died shortly after being wounded during rehearsals at a ranch on the outskirts of Santa Fe in October 2021.

            Baldwin agreed to forgo a hearing to have his rights explained to him. A judge on Thursday set conditions of release that allow Baldwin to have limited contact with potential witnesses in connection with plans to complete the filming of “Rust.”











            Prosecutors and defense attorneys are preparing for a likely preliminary hearing within a few months to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to proceed to trial.

            Other provisions of Baldwin's pretrial release include a prohibition on consuming alcohol and against any possession of weapons, including firearms.

            “Defendant is permitted to have contact with potential witnesses only ... in connection with completing the ‘Rust’ movie and other related and unrelated business matters; provided, however, that defendant is not permitted to discuss the accident at issue,"" state District Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer said in a signed order.

            The involuntary manslaughter charges against Baldwin, a lead actor and co-producer on “Rust,” and armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed are punishable by up to 18 months in jail and a $5,000 fine under New Mexico law.

            Authorities said Baldwin was pointing a pistol at Hutchins when the gun went off, killing her and wounding director Joel Souza.

            Baldwin’s attorney Luke Nikas said when the charges were announced that they were “a terrible miscarriage of justice.” He said Baldwin relied on the professionals with whom he worked and “had no reason to believe there was a live bullet in the gun.”

            Work on “Rust” was halted with Hutchins' death. Rust Movie Productions says filming is expected to resume this spring, without the use of real weapons or ammunition.

            Hutchins’ widower, Matthew Hutchins, will be the film’s new executive producer, fulfilling the terms of a legal settlement to a wrongful death lawsuit against Baldwin and other “Rust” producers.

            A related documentary is planned that would detail the completion of the film and the life of Hutchins.

            Gutierrez-Reed is scheduled to appear remotely at a court hearing Friday, Her attorney says Gutierrez-Reed will enter a plea of not guilty.

            Prosecutors say assistant director David Halls, who oversaw safety on set, has signed an agreement to plead guilty in the negligent use of a deadly weapon, explaining that he may have handled the gun improperly before it was given to Baldwin.

            A judge is scheduled to consider approval of the plea agreement in March.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819857,Phillies' Dombrowski: Harper likely to report in 2 weeks,"Bryce Harper’s arrival at spring training camp remains a couple of weeks away as the Philadelphia Phillies slugger recovers from elbow surgery.

            Phillies president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski said Thursday that Harper is taking swings with a bat at home in Las Vegas and will report March 8 or 9.

            
                Harper had surgery on his right elbow in November after leading the Phillies to the NL pennant. The Phillies said then that Harper was expected to return in a designated hitter role by the All-Star break and could play right field by season's end.











            “He’s doing great from the recovery perspective,” Dombrowski said. “In his progress, doctors are happy where he is.”

            Phillies manager Rob Thomson said the next step in the rehab progress will be Harper hitting off a tee and taking soft toss in a batting cage.

            The 30-year-old Harper sustained small tear of the ulnar collateral ligament in April. He last played right field at Miami on April 16. 

            Harper had a platelet-rich plasma injection in May and shifted to DH. He went on to help the Phillies reach their first World Series since 2009, and they lost to Houston in six games.

            He hit .349 with six homers and 13 RBIs in 17 postseason games.

            Harper missed two months last season after breaking a thumb when he was hit by a pitch in late June. The two-time NL MVP hit .286 with 18 homers and 65 RBIs in 99 games.

            THOMPSON OFFERS ARBITRATION ANALYSIS

            Tampa Bay reliever Ryan Thompson called for more transparency in the arbitration process after losing his case last week. Thompson will make $1 million rather than the $1.2 million he sought.

            “The biggest issue with this process to me is that the arbitrators get to make whatever decision they come to, but with no explanation or defense of the decision,” Thompson said in a lengthy Twitter thread. “In any other legal case, the decision is public, this for some reason is very hidden and secretive.

            “If the process is created in order for fairness, then why don’t we learn the laws of the land? In some sense, we were shooting in the dark not knowing what the arbitrators leaned into and what they disregarded. These understandings matter.”

            Major League Baseball and the players' association agreed when they established arbitration for 1974 that only a decision would be issued, with no explanation.

            Thompson said he had no hard feelings toward the Rays and said they were “as professional and respectful as possible considering the circumstances.” But he had issues with the statistics that were used to judge his worth as a middle reliever.

            Thompson said he considers holds and leverage index the most important statistics for a middle reliever or setup man such as himself. He said the Rays discredited his statistics in those categories and noted his blown saves, lack of usage against left-handers and what he cited as a Fangraphs metric called “meltdowns,” which essentially notes whether a pitcher made his team more likely to lose by a certain amount.

            Thompson also noted that he was told not to reveal the date of his case to make sure arbitrators wouldn’t research him beforehand and create a bias.

            “However, upon entry to the hearing, they all have phones out and they use them freely during the breaks,” Thompson tweeted. “After the case, they don’t sit in the room and hash out the decision, but rather they had to the hotel bar. It is extremely disconcerting that the arbitrators are socializing, drinking and using their devices prior to making a decision. (Not at all assuming foul play). Just an obvious flaw I witnessed.”

            Thompson, 30, went 3-3 with three saves and a 3.80 ERA in 47 appearances last season.

            
                Milwaukee Brewers pitcher Corbin Burnes said last week “there’s no denying that the relationship is definitely hurt” after the 2021 NL Cy Young Award winner heard the team’s arguments during a hearing he lost, resulting in a $10.01 million salary rather than the $10.75 million he requested

            Major League Baseball proposed in bargaining last year to replace arbitration with a metric-based system, but the players’ association preferred the current system.

            CORTES CONTINUES ADVANCING 

            New York Yankees All-Star left-hander Nestor Cortes worked an inning in his first simulated game since a strained right hamstring resulted in a 10-day layoff.

            The injury cost Cortes a chance to pitch for the U.S. in the World Baseball Classic.

            Cortes, who struck out Anthony Rizzo, is set to have another simulated game before possibly appearing in a spring training game.

            “Actually, it was a lot better than I thought it would be,” Cortes said. “Just because it was my first live, I didn’t know how the leg was going to react with the intensity and facing those guys.”

            Cortes went 12-4 with a 2.44 ERA in 28 starts last year.

            BEN GAMEL JOINS RAYS

            Outfielder Ben Gamel and the Tampa Bay Rays finalized a minor league contract.

            Gamel, who turns 31 on May 17, hit .232 with nine home runs and 46 RBIs in 115 games with the Pittsburgh Pirates last season. He's a .253 career hitter with 40 homers and 198 RBIs over portions of seven seasons with the New York Yankees, Seattle, Milwaukee, Cleveland and Pittsburgh.

            AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsBryce Harper’s arrival at spring training camp remains a couple of weeks away as the Philadelphia Phillies slugger recovers from elbow surgery.Phillies president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski said Thursday that Harper is taking swings with a bat at home in Las Vegas and will report March 8 or 9.Harper had surgery on his right elbow in November after leading the Phillies to the NL pennant. The Phillies said then that Harper was expected to return in a designated hitter role by the All-Star break and could play right field by season's end.“He’s doing great from the recovery perspective,” Dombrowski said. “In his progress, doctors are happy where he is.”Phillies manager Rob Thomson said the next step in the rehab progress will be Harper hitting off a tee and taking soft toss in a batting cage.The 30-year-old Harper sustained small tear of the ulnar collateral ligament in April. He last played right field at Miami on April 16.Harper had a platelet-rich plasma injection in May and shifted to DH. He went on to help the Phillies reach their first World Series since 2009, and they lost to Houston in six games.He hit .349 with six homers and 13 RBIs in 17 postseason games.Harper missed two months last season after breaking a thumb when he was hit by a pitch in late June. The two-time NL MVP hit .286 with 18 homers and 65 RBIs in 99 games.THOMPSON OFFERS ARBITRATION ANALYSISTampa Bay reliever Ryan Thompson called for more transparency in the arbitration process after losing his case last week. Thompson will make $1 million rather than the $1.2 million he sought.“The biggest issue with this process to me is that the arbitrators get to make whatever decision they come to, but with no explanation or defense of the decision,” Thompson said in a lengthy Twitter thread. “In any other legal case, the decision is public, this for some reason is very hidden and secretive.“If the process is created in order for fairness, then why don’t we learn the laws of the land? In some sense, we were shooting in the dark not knowing what the arbitrators leaned into and what they disregarded. These understandings matter.”Major League Baseball and the players' association agreed when they established arbitration for 1974 that only a decision would be issued, with no explanation.Thompson said he had no hard feelings toward the Rays and said they were “as professional and respectful as possible considering the circumstances.” But he had issues with the statistics that were used to judge his worth as a middle reliever.Thompson said he considers holds and leverage index the most important statistics for a middle reliever or setup man such as himself. He said the Rays discredited his statistics in those categories and noted his blown saves, lack of usage against left-handers and what he cited as a Fangraphs metric called “meltdowns,” which essentially notes whether a pitcher made his team more likely to lose by a certain amount.Thompson also noted that he was told not to reveal the date of his case to make sure arbitrators wouldn’t research him beforehand and create a bias.“However, upon entry to the hearing, they all have phones out and they use them freely during the breaks,” Thompson tweeted. “After the case, they don’t sit in the room and hash out the decision, but rather they had to the hotel bar. It is extremely disconcerting that the arbitrators are socializing, drinking and using their devices prior to making a decision. (Not at all assuming foul play). Just an obvious flaw I witnessed.”Thompson, 30, went 3-3 with three saves and a 3.80 ERA in 47 appearances last season.Milwaukee Brewers pitcher Corbin Burnes said last week “there’s no denying that the relationship is definitely hurt” after the 2021 NL Cy Young Award winner heard the team’s arguments during a hearing he lost, resulting in a $10.01 million salary rather than the $10.75 million he requestedMajor League Baseball proposed in bargaining last year to replace arbitration with a metric-based system, but the players’ association preferred the current system.CORTES CONTINUES ADVANCINGNew York Yankees All-Star left-hander Nestor Cortes worked an inning in his first simulated game since a strained right hamstring resulted in a 10-day layoff.The injury cost Cortes a chance to pitch for the U.S. in the World Baseball Classic.Cortes, who struck out Anthony Rizzo, is set to have another simulated game before possibly appearing in a spring training game.“Actually, it was a lot better than I thought it would be,” Cortes said. “Just because it was my first live, I didn’t know how the leg was going to react with the intensity and facing those guys.”Cortes went 12-4 with a 2.44 ERA in 28 starts last year.BEN GAMEL JOINS RAYSOutfielder Ben Gamel and the Tampa Bay Rays finalized a minor league contract.Gamel, who turns 31 on May 17, hit .232 with nine home runs and 46 RBIs in 115 games with the Pittsburgh Pirates last season.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819858,Hit man in political murder-for-hire sentenced to 20 years,"NEWARK, N.J. (AP) — The man who admitted to helping carry out a murder-for-hire plot engineered by a former New Jersey political consultant was sentenced Thursday to 20 years in prison. 

            Bomani Africa appeared in federal district court for sentencing in the 2014 death of Michael Galdieri, the son of a former state senator, after pleading guilty just over a year ago. 

            According to prosecutors, Africa and George Bratsenis stabbed Galdieri and then set his Jersey City apartment on fire in exchange for cash at the request of political consultant Sean Caddle. Bratsenis and Caddle both pleaded guilty in the case that stunned New Jersey politics but have yet to be sentenced. 











            A number of questions about the case remain unanswered: Why did Caddle want Galdieri, his one-time friend, dead? Why was he given house arrest after pleading guilty last year? And were the guilty pleas connected to other investigations?

            The revelations about Galdieri’s killing jolted political circles in New Jersey — a state infamous for dozens of political corruption convictions over the past three decades, as well as skullduggery like the 2013 “Bridgegate” scandal involving traffic jams purposely created near the busy George Washington Bridge for political retribution.

            Caddle was well-known in northern New Jersey politics, with past clients including current Democratic U.S. Sen. Bob Menendez and former Democratic state Sen. Raymond Lesniak.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819859,Rangers new ace deGrom finally throws 1st bullpen of spring,"SURPRISE, Ariz. (AP) — Jacob deGrom came out of his first bullpen session of spring training for the Texas Rangers on Thursday feeling good after not throwing off a mound the first eight days of camp with his new team. 

            “It was a small step, but a step in the right direction,” deGrom said. 

            
                The two-time National League Cy Young Award winner was held out of the Rangers' first official workout Feb. 15 because of tightness in his left side. He threw off flat ground four days after that, and had thrown about six bullpen sessions before getting to Arizona. 











            The right-hander threw 22 pitches, all of them easy fastballs, during Thursday's session. About half the pitches were from a half-height mound, and he then finished on a regulation mound.

            “They said just nice and easy,” deGrom said of what coaches told him to do. “The goal of today was to just go through my delivery, stay nice and smooth. ... Not trying to do too much, let everything get in line, and let my delivery be nice and clean.”

            DeGrom said the plan moving forward was to keep progressing, build up his pitch count and get in some games. His first bullpen session came a day before the Rangers' scheduled Cactus League spring opener, and exactly five weeks before the regular season opens at home March 30 against NL champion Philadelphia. 

            “Felt really good,” he said. “The past few days have felt really good, felt back to normal.”

            
                Texas signed deGrom to a $185 million, five-year contract in December. The 34-year-old deGrom spent the first nine years of his big league career with the Mets, but injuries limited him to 156 1/3 innings in 26 starts over the past two seasons. 

            After missing the final three months of the 2021 season with right forearm tightness and a sprained elbow, deGrom was shut down late in spring training last year because of a stress reaction in his right scapula. He didn’t pitch in the big leagues last season until August, then became a free agent for the first time. 

            He felt what he called minor tightness in his left side after getting to Arizona, and told team officials about it. His right arm has felt good throughout.

            “The last thing you want to do is come in and say, ‘left side’s a little sore.’ But, you know, we were cautious with it,” deGrom said. “Looking at it now, I think that was the right step. You’ve still got time to build up and get ready."" 

            New Rangers manager Bruce Bochy, who spoke to reporters before Thursday's workout, said the previous day that there were no concerns about deGrom's delay getting on the mound. 

            “Well, you look at the throwing he did before, we decided to back off a little bit,” Bochy said. “It’s not any concern on our part, especially where we’re at in spring training here. ... He feels great.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819860,Alligator pulled from NYC lake had swallowed bathtub stopper,"NEW YORK (AP) — The alligator that was rescued from a chilly lake in New York City over the weekend had swallowed a bathtub stopper, authorities said.

            The nearly 5-foot-long (1.5-meter-long) female alligator was lethargic and suffering from exposure to the cold when it was found in Brooklyn's Prospect Park Lake on Sunday, according to a spokesperson for the Bronx Zoo, where the gator is recovering.

            After being spotted by a park maintenance worker Sunday morning, the alligator was pulled from the lake and taken to Animal Care Centers of New York City before it was brought to the Bronx Zoo.











            Zoo officials said in a news release that the rescued alligator is too weak to eat on its own and is being tube-fed. At 15 pounds (6.8 kilos), the alligator is extremely emaciated, as an alligator of its length should weigh 30 to 35 pounds (13.6 to 15.9 kilos), they said.

            X-Rays show that the alligator, estimated to be 5 to 6 years old, had ingested a 4-inch (10-centimeter) bathtub stopper, zoo officials said, noting that the animal is too weak for veterinarians to try to remove it.

            It is illegal to have an alligator in New York state, but it is not uncommon for people to buy young alligators and then abandon them. A baby alligator was found in a swimming pool in suburban Bayport in 2019.

            Animal Care Centers spokesperson Katy Hansen said the organization has taken in six American alligators since 2018.

            Bronx Zoo Director Jim Breheny called the alligator found Sunday a sad example of the exotic pet trade. “People need to think before they acquire exotic animals,” Breheny said. “Everyone needs to know and realize that wild animals don’t make good pets.”

            Breheny said leaving the alligator in a lake in Brooklyn in the wintertime ""was an irresponsible act and certainly not in the animal’s best interest.”NEW YORK (AP) — The alligator that was rescued from a chilly lake in New York City over the weekend had swallowed a bathtub stopper, authorities said.The nearly 5-foot-long (1.5-meter-long) female alligator was lethargic and suffering from exposure to the cold when it was found in Brooklyn's Prospect Park Lake on Sunday, according to a spokesperson for the Bronx Zoo, where the gator is recovering.After being spotted by a park maintenance worker Sunday morning, the alligator was pulled from the lake and taken to Animal Care Centers of New York City before it was brought to the Bronx Zoo.Zoo officials said in a news release that the rescued alligator is too weak to eat on its own and is being tube-fed.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819861,"Sondheim covers on Instagram, TikTok paved Eleri Ward's path","NEW YORK (AP) — It was 2019 and aspiring Broadway actor Eleri Ward had Stephen Sondheim’s “Every Day a Little Death” stuck in her head.

            “I would see friends at auditions and whatnot, and having been awake since like 4 or 5 a.m., they’d ask me how I’m doing,” she said. “And I responded with, ‘Oh, every day a little death.’ I was saying it as a stupid joke.”

            She decided to record an acoustic rendition in her New York apartment's living room and posted the iPhone video to Instagram on a Friday afternoon that March. 











            Her innovation helped fulfill her aspiration: That simple post, amassing 120 likes, would lead to a recording contract, a job as the opening act for Josh Groban on tour last summer and the release Friday of her second indie-folk CD of Sondheim covers, “Keep a Tender Distance,” on Ghostlight Records.

            “She’s completely unafraid of exploring the darkness of loneliness, as Sondheim does as well,” said two-time Tony Award winner Donna Murphy, the original Fosca in “Passion.” “She’s a fully present human in expressing both through her music and through what she shares in conversation with her audiences about what’s painful about being human.”

            After the initial Instagram post, sung in a style inspired by Sufjan Stevens, Ward's friend pushed her to explore more from Sondheim.

            “So the very next day I came up with 'Johanna (Reprise),’” Ward said. During the pandemic, Ward and her boyfriend put the contents of their New York apartment in storage and moved to Boston. By January 2021, she was posting her Sondheim videos to TikTok, at the suggestion of another friend.

            “People really responded to them, wanted me to release these covers on streaming services,” Ward recalled. “So I said, ‘OK, I know how to record guitar and vocals and keyboard,’ so we had a walk-in closet in this apartment in Boston and I started recording what I had already created and editing and creating new things along the way.” 

            She made a TikTok asking Broadway World to write about her album, and the website subsequently ran a Q&A. Kurt Deutsch, founder of Ghostlight Records and a senior vice president of Warner Music Entertainment & Theatrical Ventures, read that story, searched online, discovered “Johanna (Reprise)” and messaged Ward on Instagram.

            “I was in my Boston apartment about to eat sushi with my boyfriend and I freaked out,” Ward said.

            “I had never really heard Sondheim done in that way,” Deutsch said. “I found her music just glorious and I said, ‘Do you have more?’”

            Ward’s debut album of acoustic Sondheim covers, “A Perfect Little Death,” was recorded in the closet of the Boston apartment and released by Ghostlight on Oct. 1, 2021. 

            For her second album she was afforded 11 sessions last year at Better Company in Brooklyn and got to lay down her own backing vocals. The recording was initially issued digitally in September, and Ward made her off-Broadway debut last fall as a swing in “Only Gold.” She’s in the midst of a winter/spring solo tour with dates all over the country.

            Ward couldn't contain her tears as she walked onstage at Manhattan's Sony Hall for a December concert. She was overwhelmed with joy when Bobby Conte and Jennifer Simard, standouts in last season's revival of “Company,” joined her for duets.

            “I lead with my heart when I’m performing.” Ward said. “My solo shows, this is my chance to open up my whole soul to you. It’s a very vulnerable but beautiful experience.”

            Now 28, Ward grew up in the Chicago suburb of Burr Ridge, Illinois, her mom an interior designer and real estate broker and her dad a consultant. She started piano lessons at 5 and remembers seeing “Sweeney Todd” at the suburban Drury Lane Theatre and attending a Sondheim talk with critic Frank Rich.

            After graduation from high school at Chicago Academy of the Arts, where Ward sang Amy in “Company,” she enrolled at Boston's Berklee College of Music. Ward transferred across the street to the Boston Conservatory and earned a 2017 bachelor of fine arts degree in musical theater with an emphasis in acting and songwriting.

            She picked up a guitar in 2016 only because a friend was selling hers for $40. 

            “It totally open and whole new voice for me artistically,” Ward said. “I was writing completely different music on guitar and I just sort of fell in love with it.”

            Days after her debut album's release, Ghostlight helped arranged a concert at Rockwood Music Hall in Manhattan. Groban was in attendance, having been given a copy of her recording by Kevin Gore, Warner's president of global catalog for recorded music.

            
                Sondheim died that November at age 91, bringing wider attention to Ward’s covers. In December, Groban asked Ward to criss-cross the U.S. with him for a 26-show, six-week summer tour.

            Emotion overflowed last March after Ward's concert at New York's 184-seat Joe’s Pub, where she sang a duet of “Loving You” with Murphy. Ward was introduced after the show to Rick Pappas, Sondheim’s lawyer and the executor of his estate.

            “Rick says, 'I want you to know that Sondheim loved your album and loved that you were doing something he never imagined with his music and bringing it to new audiences,'” Ward said. “I’m holding onto Donna Murphy, crying, and she’s crying.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819863,League Cup could be start of Man United-Newcastle rivalry,"MANCHESTER, England (AP) — It’s fair to say Manchester United and Newcastle have their sights on much bigger prizes than the English League Cup.

            Both teams, however, will recognize the significance of lifting the first major trophy of the season and potentially signaling the start of a new era of success for the winner.

            Sunday’s final at Wembley is a meeting of two rising forces in the Premier League who will hope to be going head-to-head at the top of the sport for years to come.











            Which is why a first piece of silverware could be such an essential building block.

            United looks transformed under manager Erik ten Hag, who has guided the 20-time English champions to his first final at the earliest possible point after taking over at the end of last season. It's sparked talk of an unlikely title challenge.

            After six years without a trophy, United fans are desperate for something to cheer and hungry for evidence the club is ready to challenge the dominance of fierce rival Manchester City.

            For Newcastle, the wait for a major piece of domestic silverware has been considerably longer — 68 years in fact since it won the FA Cup in 1955. And hopes of success had all but faded until Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund bought the club in 2021, making it arguably the richest in world soccer.

            Newcastle’s development is possibly quicker than some expected and has come without the sort of exorbitant spending seen from other clubs that have experienced sudden wealth.

            Under manager Eddie Howe, a sound, if unspectacular, transfer strategy has put a team that looked set for relegation last season in serious contention for a top-four Champions League qualifying spot.

            A ticket into Europe’s elite club competition would open the door for marquee signings and further improvement on the field, with the ultimate aim of challenging for the biggest titles alongside the giants of the game.

            While Newcastle’s top-four challenge has slipped in recent weeks, Howe’s team, which will be without suspended goalkeeper Nick Pope, still appears ahead of schedule and a trophy would underline his impressive work so far.

            Ten Hag, however, has also exceeded expectations in his first season in charge, especially after such a humbling start to the campaign in which his team lost its opening two games.

            Sitting five points off leader Arsenal, third-place United is in contention at the top of the Premier League, while the League Cup gives the Dutchman the chance to win only the club’s fourth trophy since the retirement of iconic former manager Alex Ferguson in 2013.

            Louis van Gaal won the FA Cup in 2016, but was fired at the end of that season.

            His replacement Jose Mourinho won the League Cup and the Europa League in his first season in 2017, but that trophy double proved to be the height of his reign, which ended when he was fired in 2018.

            There is hope among fans that a trophy for Ten Hag would be a genuine pointer to a new period of success, rather than a false dawn, and the League Cup has been used as a platform for winning eras at other clubs in recent years.

            The first of Mourinho’s seven trophies at Chelsea was the League Cup in 2005 and it was also Pep Guardiola’s first at City in 2018.

            While there is no guarantee it would have a similar impact for either United or Newcastle, it would be confirmation of the progress being made at both clubs.

            Ten Hag was hired to bring the good times back to United, while expectations are growing at Newcastle after the influx of money from Saudi Arabia.

            It is the League Cup at stake on Sunday, but the final could be a warm-up for much greater challenges between these two clubs going forward.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819865,Bieniemy takes next step as Commanders offensive coordinator,"ASHBURN, Va. (AP) — Eric Bieniemy knew he was almost certainly leaving the Kansas City Chiefs before they won a second Super Bowl in four years. 

            After interviewing 16 times for 15 different NFL head coaching jobs in past years, he also knew this time he probably was not getting another look to run a team. So, the longtime successful Chiefs offensive coordinator kept an eye out for his next challenge.

            
                That turned out to be joining the Washington Commanders as offensive coordinator and assistant head coach, a gig under Ron Rivera that should give Bieniemy the chance to show what he can do out of the shadow of Andy Reid and two-time MVP Patrick Mahomes.











            Bieniemy is ready — “fired up,"" as he said multiple times at his introductory news conference Thursday — to make Washington's offense his own, call plays and shut out all the noise about why he isn't an NFL coach in his own right.

            “Being a head coach right now, it hasn’t happened,” Bieniemy said. “It’s not anything that’s going to impact me moving forward because the only thing I need to be concerned with is what’s important today. Today I got to be the best person that I can be. I got to be the best coach that I can be.”

            Bieniemy, who turns 54 during training camp in August, became the best candidate out of more than a half-dozen interviews after Rivera went through the first week of interviews wanting to find someone quickly and started watching the playoffs instead. He saw what the Chiefs could do on offense and envisioned some of those characteristics with the Commanders, who relied on a stout defense to get to 8-8-1 last season.

            “We've got our guy,” Rivera said proudly in introducing Bieniemy. “We really, truly feel we found the right guy. We found the guy that we believe can step up and be the guy that we’re looking for.""

            Rivera also found a coach he was fortunate to scoop up as an assistant after Bieniemy was previously interviewed to coach the Atlanta Falcons, Arizona Cardinals, Carolina Panthers, Cincinnati Bengals, Denver Broncos, Detroit Lions, Houston Texans, Indianapolis Colts, Jacksonville Jaguars, Los Angeles Chargers, Miami Dolphins, New Orleans Saints, New York Giants, Philadelphia Eagles — and the New York Jets twice.

            As has been well publicized, Bieniemy did not get any of those jobs. But Rivera sees a little of his path in his new play-caller after being a linebacker-turned defensive coordinator under a defensive coach, who had to go work for someone on the other side of the ball to get a head job.

            “I interviewed eight, nine times before I got my opportunity. And I know it’s the same thing for him: Eventually he’s going to get that opportunity,” Rivera said, also citing Sean McDermott's path from a coordinator under Reid to coach of the Buffalo Bills. 

            “Maybe this’ll be a good thing for Eric, which I’m hoping. We’re going to live in the now, and that’s about winning football games.”

            Bieniemy, who was running the Chiefs' offense during their run of five consecutive AFC championship game appearances with three trips to the Super Bowl, said he was only worried about two letters of the alphabet: “a W or an L.”

            There have been far more losses than wins for Washington over the past couple of decades compared to Kansas City, and yet he was still ready to leave in what could be the middle of a modern day dynasty.

            “One thing in this profession you learn is comfort is the enemy of progress,” Bieniemy said. “I don’t like being comfortable, so I’m about accepting challenges and moving forward. This presents a challenge to me.”

            Bieniemy inherits an offense that ranked 20th in the league last season and a second-year quarterback in Sam Howell, who has one game of pro experience and trails Mahomes by 228 NFL touchdown passes. 

            “I’m just super excited to have (Bieniemy) here,” said Howell, the 2022 fifth-round pick out of North Carolina who goes into offseason workouts as the starter. “Obviously he came from an organization with Patrick Mahomes, so they had a lot of success together. Hopefully we can kind of bring some of that over here.”

            Asked why he chose this job, Bieniemy said, “Why not Washington?” and pointed to the talent already in place in offense. That starts with top wide receiver Terry McLaurin, who's signed long term and will be working under his third different play-caller since entering the league in 2019.

            McLaurin said Bieniemy “brings a championship-caliber” approach to Washington, which has not won the Super Bowl since the glory days of Joe Gibbs and Co. in the 1980s and early '90s.

            Fresh off celebrating his second Super Bowl victory, Bieniemy did not wear his first championship ring to the team facility Thursday. 

            The several players from Howell and McLaurin and beyond already know that, and Bieniemy hopes to show it to them starting next season, yet another as an assistant with coaching his own team a worry for down the line.

            “I have to be accountable to these men, so all that stuff about being a head coach, we could talk about that next year some time,” he said. “Right now, I’m focused on the job at hand.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819866,"Israel approves over 7,000 settlement homes, groups say","JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel’s far-right government has granted approval for over 7,000 new homes in Jewish settlements in the West Bank, settlement backers and opponents said Thursday. The move defies growing international opposition to construction in the occupied territory.

            The announcement came just days after the U.N. Security Council passed a statement strongly criticizing Israeli settlement construction on occupied lands claimed by the Palestinians. The United States, Israel’s closest ally, blocked what would have been an even tougher legally binding resolution, with diplomats saying they had received Israeli assurances of refraining from unilateral acts for six months. 

            The new approvals took place during a two-day meeting that ended Thursday and appeared to contradict those claims. The U.S. has repeatedly criticized Israeli settlement construction, saying it undermines hopes for a two-state solution with the Palestinians, but taken no action to stop it.











            Peace Now, an anti-settlement watchdog group that attended the meeting, said a planning committee granted approvals for some 7,100 new housing units across the West Bank. 

            The group said the committee scheduled a meeting next month to discuss plans to develop a strategic area east of Jerusalem known as E1. The U.S. in the past has blocked the project, which would largely bisect the West Bank and which critics say would make it impossible to establish a viable Palestinian state alongside Israel.

            Lior Amihai, the group's incoming director, said some 5,200 housing units were in the early stages of planning, while the remainder were approved for near-term construction. He also said construction was approved in four unauthorized outposts.

            Earlier this week, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said he had pledged not to legalize any more wildcat outposts. He made the promise after retroactively legalizing 10 existing outposts earlier this month. 

            The Israeli government is “spitting on the face of the U.S., only a few days after announcing that they committed to them that there would be no advancement of settlements in the near future,” said Peace Now.

            The United States criticized the decision. “We view the expansion of settlements as an obstacle to peace that undermines the geographic viability of a two-state solution,” said a National Security Council Statement. But it gave no indication that the U.S. was prepared to act.

            Nabil Abu Rudeineh, spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, appealed to the United States to intervene. “The American side is required to stop this violation, which will not lead to any peace or stability in the region,” he said.

            The planned construction is likely to add to the already heightened tensions following an Israeli military raid that killed 10 Palestinians in the West Bank city of Nablus on Wednesday.

            The international community, along with the Palestinians, considers settlement construction illegal or illegitimate. Over 700,000 Israelis now live in the occupied West Bank and east Jerusalem — territories captured by Israel in 1967 and sought by the Palestinians for a future independent state. 

            Netanyahu’s new coalition, which took office in late December, is dominated by religious and ultranationalist politicians with close ties to the settlement movement. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, a firebrand settler leader, on Thursday was officially granted Cabinet-level authority over settlement policies. 

            Smotrich had promised earlier this month a major settlement push. His office declined to comment Thursday, but settler representatives, who also attended the planning meeting, celebrated what they said were new approvals.

            Yossi Dagan, a settler leader in the northern West Bank, welcomed the retroactive approval of 118 homes in “Nofei Nehemia,” an outpost in the northern West Bank, after a 20-year struggle. “Great news for Samaria, for settlement and for the entire nation of Israel,” he said, using the biblical name for the region.

            Shlomo Neeman, chairman of the Yesha settler’s council, declared the approvals “a tremendous boost.” Neeman is also mayor of the “Gush Etzion” settlement bloc near Jerusalem, where settlers said hundreds of new homes were approved.

            The decision marks one of the largest approvals of settlement construction in years. In comparison, some 8,000 units were approved in the previous two years, according to Peace Now. 

            “It's very big,” said Amihai.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819869,Conspiracies fuel GOP switch on Kansas' ballot grace period,"TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) — Kansas' GOP-controlled Legislature showed Thursday that it's likely to pass a bill eliminating the three extra days state voters get to return mail-in ballots after an election, highlighting the influence election conspiracy theories still hold over Republicans' thinking.

            But the vote totals in the Kansas House and Senate strongly suggested conspiracy theory backers don't have the clout to overcome Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly's possible opposition. Each chamber approved its own, separate version of the bill but each fell short of the two-thirds majority needed to override any possible veto. 

            GOP lawmakers voted unanimously in 2017 to create the three-day grace period. That came amid concerns a restructuring of the U.S. Postal Service's mail-sorting operations had slowed the delivery of ballots. 











            On Thursday, 34 of the 44 Republicans still serving in either the House or the Senate voted to eliminate the grace period, including House Speaker Dan Hawkins and Senate President Ty Masterson, both Wichita-area Republicans.

            Even though Kansas election officials have reported no potential fraud involving the grace period, many Republicans argue that eliminating it will restore public confidence in the state’s elections. Baseless election conspiracies have floated widely within the GOP since 2020, with former President Donald Trump repeatedly making false claims about his loss. 

            “All you’ve got to do is read the papers and what you guys say,” Hawkins told reporters before the House vote. “I mean, people do question the fraud all the time. Is there fraud? I think actually we’re a fairly good state. But we can always make things better.""

            The vote in the House was 77-45, and with two Republicans absent, supporters were at least six votes short of the 84 needed to override a veto in the 125-member chamber. In the 40-member Senate, the vote was 23-17, leaving the backers of its separate bill four votes short.

            Either one chamber will have to pass the other's bill to send it to Kelly, or the House and Senate will negotiate a version for both to approve. A version of the proposal is expected to clear the Legislature by early April. 

            Supporters of eliminating the grace period also suggested that Kansas is out of step with most other states. Thirty-one states require a mail ballot to arrive by Election Day to be counted, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Kansas, Massachusetts and Virginia have three-day grace periods.

            “There's nothing magical about it,” state Rep. Paul Waggoner, a Republican from south-central Kansas, said during a debate Wednesday. 

            While Kelly hasn't said publicly that she would veto such a measure, her office said she is worried that the bill would prevent some voters serving in the military from having their ballots counted, disenfranchising them.

            A few Republicans who want to keep the grace period in place made the same argument. Others, like many Democrats, contend that U.S. mail service has gotten only slower in the intervening six years.

            ""We should always err on the side of the voter and do everything to accommodate and count legal ballots,” Republican state Rep. Jesse Borjon, of Topeka, said in a statement read by a House clerk. Borjon formerly worked in the Kansas secretary of state's office. 

            
                Republicans also are split over whether the state should eliminate remote ballot drop boxes. The Senate approving a bill to do that Thursday on a 21-19 vote, while the House approved, 109-12, a bill that would keep the drop boxes but allow Secretary of State Scott Schwab, a vocal promoter of them, to set standard rules for counties governing their use. 

            But one sign that election conspiracies still influence Republicans came earlier this month when the GOP state committee narrowly elected conspiracy promoter Mike Brown to serve as the party's state chair through the 2024 elections. Brown also ran for secretary of state last year, losing the GOP primary to Schwab. 

            “This idea that people have lost confidence in elections is because we have a bunch of loonies running around,” House Democratic Leader Vic Miller, of Topeka, said during Wednesday's debate. “Yes, if you repeat an incorrect statement often enough, unfortunately, some people begin to believe it.”

That came amid concerns a restructuring of the U.S. Postal Service's mail-sorting operations had slowed the delivery of ballots.On Thursday, 34 of the 44 Republicans still serving in either the House or the Senate voted to eliminate the grace period, including House Speaker Dan Hawkins and Senate President Ty Masterson, both Wichita-area Republicans.Even though Kansas election officials have reported no potential fraud involving the grace period, many Republicans argue that eliminating it will restore public confidence in the state’s elections. Baseless election conspiracies have floated widely within the GOP since 2020, with former President Donald Trump repeatedly making false claims about his loss.“All you’ve got to do is read the papers and what you guys say,” Hawkins told reporters before the House vote. “I mean, people do question the fraud all the time. Is there fraud? I think actually we’re a fairly good state. But we can always make things better.""The vote in the House was 77-45, and with two Republicans absent, supporters were at least six votes short of the 84 needed to override a veto in the 125-member chamber. In the 40-member Senate, the vote was 23-17, leaving the backers of its separate bill four votes short.Either one chamber will have to pass the other's bill to send it to Kelly, or the House and Senate will negotiate a version for both to approve. A version of the proposal is expected to clear the Legislature by early April.Supporters of eliminating the grace period also suggested that Kansas is out of step with most other states. Thirty-one states require a mail ballot to arrive by Election Day to be counted, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Kansas, Massachusetts and Virginia have three-day grace periods.“There's nothing magical about it,” state Rep. Paul Waggoner, a Republican from south-central Kansas, said during a debate Wednesday.While Kelly hasn't said publicly that she would veto such a measure, her office said she is worried that the bill would prevent some voters serving in the military from having their ballots counted, disenfranchising them.A few Republicans who want to keep the grace period in place made the same argument. Others, like many Democrats, contend that U.S. mail service has gotten only slower in the intervening six years.""We should always err on the side of the voter and do everything to accommodate and count legal ballots,” Republican state Rep. Jesse Borjon, of Topeka, said in a statement read by a House clerk. Borjon formerly worked in the Kansas secretary of state's office.Republicans also are split over whether the state should eliminate remote ballot drop boxes. The Senate approving a bill to do that Thursday on a 21-19 vote, while the House approved, 109-12, a bill that would keep the drop boxes but allow Secretary of State Scott Schwab, a vocal promoter of them, to set standard rules for counties governing their use.But one sign that election conspiracies still influence Republicans came earlier this month when the GOP state committee narrowly elected conspiracy promoter Mike Brown to serve as the party's state chair through the 2024 elections. Brown also ran for secretary of state last year, losing the GOP primary to Schwab.“This idea that people have lost confidence in elections is because we have a bunch of loonies running around,” House Democratic Leader Vic Miller, of Topeka, said during Wednesday's debate. “Yes, if you repeat an incorrect statement often enough, unfortunately, some people begin to believe it.”___Follow John Hanna on Twitter: https://twitter.com/apjdhanna",2023/02/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819870,Song arrives at Phils after Navy grants transfer to reserves,"CLEARWATER, Fla. (AP) — Noah Song threw and performed agility drills on a back outfield wearing Philadelphia Phillies shorts and T-shirt, a far different different uniform for the 25-year old.

            Song had been a flight officer training on a U.S. Navy P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol and reconnaissance aircraft before transferring from active duty to reserves.

            “I think really the most important thing is just recognizing the fact that I really enjoy both,” Song said Thursday while sitting on top of a picnic table just beyond the left-field fence at Phillies spring training camp. ""If there's nothing else to do other than the military, this is where I want to be. I'm feel really blessed and really lucky that I haven't had to do anything that I don't want to do yet.”











            Song impressed in his only pro season, making seven starts for Boston’s Class A Lowell affiliate in 2019, striking out 19 in 17 innings with a 1.06 ERA. With a fastball in the upper 90s mph, he went 11-1 with a 1.44 ERA and 161 strikeouts in 94 innings during his senior year at Navy.

            Song, who is from California, was taken by the Phillies from Boston in the winter meeting draft for unprotected minor league players in December with hopes he would play after military service.

            “We feel it’s worth the gamble,"" Phillies president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski said. ""We felt it was worth the upside risk. Will be able to do it? We’ll see.”

            The 6-foot-4, 200-pound right-hander said his aspiration to reach the major leagues looked further and further from reality during the past few years. Then, the transfer request made around nine months earlier was approved.

            “I don’t think a lot of people could have expected it,” Song said. “But I’m here now. I don’t really necessarily know what my future or ceiling might be. Just trying to figure out what it is, what the new one is.”

            Song last week had his bullpen session since 2019 last week. He played catch when he could on open spaces at Naval Air Station Jacksonville.

            “It felt rough,"" Song said. ""Felt like I kind of trying to walk again. I was kind of learning things.”

            Song was selected by the Red Sox in the fourth round of the 2019 amateur draft when Dombrowski headed Boston's baseball operations. Without the military committment, Dombrowski thinks Song might have been a first-round pick.

            Should he make the 26-man active roster, Song would work out of the bullpen. Dombrowski would not be surprised if Song appeared in spring training games.

            Philadelphia must keep Song on the big league roster all season. To remove him from the rosyer, the Phillies would have to offer him back to the Red Sox. 

            “However, there's a combination of rules here, too, because there's not only Rule 5 pick, there's the military list rule that gets involved,"" Dombrowski said. “Some of these rules were written before I was born. Nobody wants to see this kid get hurt.""

            Dombrowski said the rules were the same when Chicago Cubs left-hander Ken Holtzman received a pass from his military duty in 1967, allowing him to make four starts that August and September— all wins. 

            Song said his remaining military obligations are 12 years in the reserves, and one weekend and two-week stint a year. The lieutenant junior grade originally had been scheduled to make his first oerseas deployment last month to Japan.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819872,Study: Women still underrepresented in FBS leadership ranks,"Women remain significantly underrepresented in leadership positions at the Football Subdivision level of college athletics, a new study shows.

            
                Thursday’s report card from The Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport (TIDES) issued another F for gender hiring, a C for racial hiring and an overall grade of D+ for 2022. Those grades largely look as they have in past editions of the study, which have shown leadership positions like president or chancellor, athletic director and conference commissioner are dominated by white men.

            TIDES director and lead report author Richard Lapchick called the lack of significant change “incredibly discouraging.”











            “I felt that there was a shift in attitudes at all levels in sport after the murder of George Floyd and during that period of the racial reckoning,” Lapchick told the The Associated Press. “And the results that just haven’t proven that out in these leadership positions. 

            Those scores are particularly striking when examining gender.

            Women made up only 22.9% of presidents and chancellors, up slightly from last year’s figure (20.8%) after sitting as low as 13.8% in 2019. The number of women working as athletic directors dropped from 13 to 10 (7.6%) in 2022, with six of those in Power Five conferences ( Duke, Missouri, Pittsburgh, Vanderbilt, Virginia and Washington).

            Women now lead two of the FBS’ 10 leagues: Judy MacLeod with Conference USA and the Mountain West’s Gloria Nevarez, who was hired in November from the West Coast Conference.

            “There’s been no sustained improvement to make me think we’ve turned the corner and this is going to get a lot better in the next couple of years,” Lapchick said.

            Women fared best in the faculty athletics representative position — 42% for an A-minus grade. These are typically faculty members designated to serve as a liaison to the athletics department. 

            In all, white people held 79.9% (321 of 402) of leadership positions in the study. But racial hiring scores increased, showing people of color holding 21.4% of president or chancellor positions and 22.9% of AD roles, though it fell for faculty athletics representatives (16.4%).

            Felicia Martin, the NCAA's senior vice president for inclusion, education and community engagement, issued a statement that pointed to multiple steps taken by college sports' governing body to address diversity hiring. 

            Those include NCAA leadership development programs for administrators and coaches, as well as the Leadership Collective — a database to assist hiring officials in diversifying their candidate pools.

            Still, Martin said: “The report reflects the reality that there is much work that remains in diverse hiring.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819875,Man United beats Barcelona 2-1 to advance in Europa League,"MANCHESTER, England (AP) — With a sweeping first-time shot, Antony fired Manchester United to a rousing 2-1 win over Barcelona.

            The comeback victory at Old Trafford sent United into the Europa League round of 16 and kept manager Erik ten Hag’s four-pronged trophy hunt on track.

            Antony might have silenced a few critics, too.











            ""He is brave, he is fearless,” Ten Hag said of the Brazil forward who cost United $95 million for his transfer from Ajax last summer.

            With United trailing 1-0 at halftime and heading out of the tournament, Antony came off the bench to turn the match around.

            His 73rd-minute strike completed a come-from-behind win and provided further evidence that Ten Hag’s team is a rising force in Europe.

            “What he brought (in the) second half was what we needed, running in behind and dribbles and his goal,"" Ten Hag said.

            Barcelona is leading the way in Spain, eight points ahead of Champions League holder Real Madrid and seemingly on course for the domestic title.

            Yet, over two games against United, the Spanish giant was shaken by the pace and pressing of Ten Hag's players.

            “We lacked that calm and patience and started the second half really bad,” Barcelona coach Xavi Hernandez said. “Small details. We could have been more intense.”

            Robert Lewandowski’s first-half penalty had put the visitors in front on aggregate after the thrilling 2-2 draw in the first leg at the Nou Camp last week.

            But Fred’s strike in the 47th evened the match before Antony’s winner.

            In front of a raucous crowd of 73,000, this was the type of encounter United fans hope will become a regular occurrence under Ten Hag, whose outstanding first season in charge is improving by the week.

            “This is another step because when you can beat Barcelona — one of the best teams in this moment in Europe — your belief can be really strong because then I think you are able to beat anyone,” Ten Hag added.

            The Dutch manager is still in contention to win four trophies, with his team facing Newcastle in the League Cup final on Sunday.

            United also sits third in the Premier League standings and is still in the FA Cup.

            But Ten Hag's team looked in danger of being eliminated from the Europa League as Barcelona seized the advantage at Old Trafford, with Bruno Fernandes involved in the two key incidents in the first half.

            The Portugal international could have put United in front after just three minutes when he ran through on goal, only to fire against the legs of goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen.

            Having failed to take advantage at one end, Fernandes was then guilty of dragging back Alejandro Balde in the box and referee Clement Turpin pointed to the spot.

            Despite getting a hand to Lewandowski’s 18th minute penalty, David de Gea could not keep the ball out.

            United struggled to find their rhythm before the break, but evened the score in an explosive start to the second half when Fred fired past Ter Stegen after Fernandes' through ball.

            Old Trafford was rocking and it went wild when Antony swept his shot low into the far corner to put United in front.

            “We’ve had some good wins, Liverpool and Arsenal, but I think this over two legs — Barcelona are La Liga leaders — to beat them it’s a big win,” Ten Hag said.

            HAT TRICK FOR DI MARIA

            Angel Di Maria scored a hat trick as Juventus advanced in the Europa League playoffs by beating Nantes 3-0.

            Juventus won 4-1 on aggregate to ensure another of Europe’s giants will play in the round of 16.World Cup winner Di Maria opened the scoring at Stade de la Beaujoire in the fifth minute and doubled the lead in the 20th from the penalty spot after Nicolas Pallois was sent off for a handball in the box.

            The Argentine completed his hat trick in the 78th.

            Sporting Lisbon also reached the next round after Pedro Goncalves scored twice in a 4-0 win at Midtjylland to secure a 5-1 aggregate victory.

            Midtjylland's Paulinho was sent off for receiving two yellow cards in the space of two minutes in the first half.

            Bayer Leverkusen needed penalties to win an epic against Monaco after the score ended 5-5 on aggregate.

            Monaco had won the first leg in Germany 3-2, but losing 3-1 going into the last 10 minutes at the Stade Louis II, it needed a Breel Embolo goal in the 84th to send the match into extra time.

            But that only delayed Leverkusen’s celebrations as the German team won the shootout 5-3.

            FAN ATTACKS SEVILLA GOALKEEPER

            Sevilla goalkeeper Marko Dmitrović was attacked by a fan who ran onto the field in the Spanish team's game at PSV Eindhoven.

            The fan threw a punch at Dmitrović before being wrestled to the ground by the keeper during the incident which happened late in the match at the PSV Stadium.

            Dmitrović appeared to be unhurt and the fan was quickly surrounded by players from both teams before being led off the field to jeers from the crowd.

            Sevilla progressed despite losing 2-0 at PSV Eindhoven, advancing 3-2 on aggregate.

            AJAX GOES OUT

            While Ten Hag is looking forward to the next round, his former club Ajax is out after a 3-1 loss at Union Berlin.

            Roma, meanwhile, recovered from a 1-0 first-leg loss at RB Salzburg to win 2-0 at Stadio Olimpico.

            Andrea Belotti fired the home team in front in the 33rd and Paulo Dybala sealed a 2-1 aggregate scoreline five minutes before halftime.

            Shakhtar Donetsk beat Rennes on penalties after a 2-1 loss through extra time left the score at 3-3 on aggregate.

            Karl Toko Ekambi's strike in the 52nd for Rennes meant the game had to go to extra time. Ibrahim Salah then put the home team up 2-0 before an own goal from Jeanuël Belocian sent it to a shootout which Shakhtar won 5-4.

We could have been more intense.”Robert Lewandowski’s first-half penalty had put the visitors in front on aggregate after the thrilling 2-2 draw in the first leg at the Nou Camp last week.But Fred’s strike in the 47th evened the match before Antony’s winner.In front of a raucous crowd of 73,000, this was the type of encounter United fans hope will become a regular occurrence under Ten Hag, whose outstanding first season in charge is improving by the week.“This is another step because when you can beat Barcelona — one of the best teams in this moment in Europe — your belief can be really strong because then I think you are able to beat anyone,” Ten Hag added.The Dutch manager is still in contention to win four trophies, with his team facing Newcastle in the League Cup final on Sunday.United also sits third in the Premier League standings and is still in the FA Cup.But Ten Hag's team looked in danger of being eliminated from the Europa League as Barcelona seized the advantage at Old Trafford, with Bruno Fernandes involved in the two key incidents in the first half.The Portugal international could have put United in front after just three minutes when he ran through on goal, only to fire against the legs of goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen.Having failed to take advantage at one end, Fernandes was then guilty of dragging back Alejandro Balde in the box and referee Clement Turpin pointed to the spot.Despite getting a hand to Lewandowski’s 18th minute penalty, David de Gea could not keep the ball out.United struggled to find their rhythm before the break, but evened the score in an explosive start to the second half when Fred fired past Ter Stegen after Fernandes' through ball.Old Trafford was rocking and it went wild when Antony swept his shot low into the far corner to put United in front.“We’ve had some good wins, Liverpool and Arsenal, but I think this over two legs — Barcelona are La Liga leaders — to beat them it’s a big win,” Ten Hag said.HAT TRICK FOR DI MARIAAngel Di Maria scored a hat trick as Juventus advanced in the Europa League playoffs by beating Nantes 3-0.Juventus won 4-1 on aggregate to ensure another of Europe’s giants will play in the round of 16.World Cup winner Di Maria opened the scoring at Stade de la Beaujoire in the fifth minute and doubled the lead in the 20th from the penalty spot after Nicolas Pallois was sent off for a handball in the box.The Argentine completed his hat trick in the 78th.Sporting Lisbon also reached the next round after Pedro Goncalves scored twice in a 4-0 win at Midtjylland to secure a 5-1 aggregate victory.Midtjylland's Paulinho was sent off for receiving two yellow cards in the space of two minutes in the first half.Bayer Leverkusen needed penalties to win an epic against Monaco after the score ended 5-5 on aggregate.Monaco had won the first leg in Germany 3-2, but losing 3-1 going into the last 10 minutes at the Stade Louis II, it needed a Breel Embolo goal in the 84th to send the match into extra time.But that only delayed Leverkusen’s celebrations as the German team won the shootout 5-3.FAN ATTACKS SEVILLA GOALKEEPERSevilla goalkeeper Marko Dmitrović was attacked by a fan who ran onto the field in the Spanish team's game at PSV Eindhoven.The fan threw a punch at Dmitrović before being wrestled to the ground by the keeper during the incident which happened late in the match at the PSV Stadium.Dmitrović appeared to be unhurt and the fan was quickly surrounded by players from both teams before being led off the field to jeers from the crowd.Sevilla progressed despite losing 2-0 at PSV Eindhoven, advancing 3-2 on aggregate.AJAX GOES OUTWhile Ten Hag is looking forward to the next round, his former club Ajax is out after a 3-1 loss at Union Berlin.Roma, meanwhile, recovered from a 1-0 first-leg loss at RB Salzburg to win 2-0 at Stadio Olimpico.Andrea Belotti fired the home team in front in the 33rd and Paulo Dybala sealed a 2-1 aggregate scoreline five minutes before halftime.Shakhtar Donetsk beat Rennes on penalties after a 2-1 loss through extra time left the score at 3-3 on aggregate.Karl Toko Ekambi's strike in the 52nd for Rennes meant the game had to go to extra time.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819877,"LIV Golf's 2nd season has team concept, new faces, TV deal","PLAYA DEL CARMEN, Mexico (AP) — Dustin Johnson was among the most prominent players to sign with Saudi-funded LIV Golf and he made it pay off by making $35.6 million in just eight tournaments, including an $18 million bonus for leading the points list and the team title.

            Now comes the encore, and Johnson was asked if he felt pressure to repeat.

            “Yeah, I'm really nervous,” he replied, keeping up with his reputation of not getting bothered by much in life and in golf.











            The curiosity goes beyond Johnson and his 4Aces, a team that includes Patrick Reed and Pat Perez and now has Peter Uihlein, who finished third on the points list.

            The rival circuit begins its second season Friday with a television partner — The CW Network in a revenue-sharing agreement — and a few new faces.

            It now is billed as LIV Golf League, with an emphasis on the 12 four-man teams that will remain the same during a 14-tournament schedule that starts at Mayakoba, the Mexican golf resort that previously held a PGA Tour event.

            “I love it because we’re here and the tour is not — end quote,” Perez said.

            The prize fund remains $20 million for medal play among 48 players, plus a $5 million purse paid out to the leading three teams.

            There was some minor shuffling. Uihlein went from Brooks Koepka's team (Smash) to join Johnson, while Koepka has added Matthew Wolff.

            But LIV Golf hasn't really been able to add more top-ranked players during the four months it was away. The biggest addition was Thomas Pieters of Belgium at No. 35 in the world. Pieters told The Telegraph he only decided to join when Hudson Swafford became sidelined for the year with a hip injury.

            Two-time Masters champion Bubba Watson signed with LIV last year while injured and makes his debut as captain of a team (RangeGoats) that includes Pieters, Talor Gooch and Harold Varner III, 

            Watson will be among seven players making their LIV debuts on Friday when the 54-hole event begins on El Camaleon golf course.

            Five players who competed in all seven individual events last year are no longer on the roster — Laurie Canter, former NCAA champion Turk Pettit, Shaun Norris, Wade Ormsby and Sadom Kaewkanjana. 

            A LIV official said several players were free agents who did not have contracts, and they were replaced. Several of those players are alternates.

            Canter is filling in at Mayakoba for two-time major winner Martin Kaymer. Alternates this week are Ormsby, Pettit and Andy Ogletree.

            LIV Golf did not have a television partner for its inaugural season and signed an agreement in January with The CW. The opening round will be available on the network's app, with weekend coverage on linear TV in the U.S.

            It also has streaming on its website for overseas viewers on an app (Liv Golf Plus) and a website (LivGolfPlus.com). LIV added its first corporate partner, EasyPost — an official marketing partner typical of other U.S. golf tours — and some teams have new logos.

            For Johnson and Garcia, the apparel will be slightly different. Both players have ended longtime deals with Adidas Golf as it works toward team uniforms.

            “For me being the captain of the team, obviously being able to go out and find a clothing sponsor is more beneficial than waiting another year,” Johnson said Wednesday. “Hopefully, my clothes get out of customs and I’ll have some stuff to wear by this weekend. But if not, I’ll be wearing some blank stuff.”

            LIV Golf's antitrust lawsuit against the PGA Tour is still in the discovery phase, and a federal judge this week ruled that Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund — which owns 93% of LIV Golf — and the fund's governor can be added as defendants in the PGA Tour's countersuit. Any trial is not expected until next year.

            Mayakoba is the first of three LIV events before the Masters on April 6-9. LIV has 17 players who are eligible for Augusta National.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819878,White House urging higher fines for train safety violations,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The White House is calling on congressional Republicans to increase the fines levied on rail companies for safety violations, as a fiery Feb. 3 train derailment in Ohio has become a political lightning rod.

            There are still safety and health concerns among residents of East Palestine after dozens of train cars being pulled by Norfolk Southern went off the tracks and released chemicals into the area. The incident has now evolved into a feud between Democrats and Republicans.

            “The test will be whether Republicans work with the Biden-Harris administration to restore safety protections and pass legislation increasing fines on rail companies when they cause accidents like this,” said White House deputy press secretary Andrew Bates. “Do they stand with us and communities like East Palestine or are they still owned by the rail lobby?”











            Under current law, the White House said, the highest fine that can be charged to companies for violations involving the transportation of hazardous materials is $225,455. That's less than 1% of Norfolk Southern's profits last year of $3.27 billion.

            Former President Donald Trump, who is seeking the 2024 GOP nomination, went to the village on Wednesday and said the community has been met with “indifference and betrayal.” Republican lawmakers have criticized President Joe Biden for not going to the site; Biden was in Ukraine and Poland this week.

            But his administration is pushing back. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg toured East Palestine on Thursday and said Trump should call for the reversals of deregulation that occurred during his term in the White House. 

            Trump famously posed in 2017 with a mounds of white paper wrapped in red tape, which he then cut with a pair of scissors. He has argued that trimming regulatory burdens would lead to stronger economic growth.

            White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre repeatedly defended the administration’s response during Thursday’s briefing, saying “that’s what leadership looks like,” instead of the “political stunts that we’re seeing from the other side.”

            She criticized Republicans as “all of the sudden” interested in safety issues after being against regulations.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819879,"Review: 'Cocaine Bear,' 100% pure, uncut junk with no high","Yes, there's a giant bear and, yes, it does a ton of coke. And, yes, just as you probably suspected, the movie blows.

            We have officially sunk very low with “Cocaine Bear,” way past other films where the title alone describes the only thing that happens, like “Snakes on a Plane,” “We Bought a Zoo” or “Sharknado.”

            Aping other genres of filmmaking, this one never finds its own voice or a way to integrate the ultra-violence with the dark comedy. It's like a parody of a parody that director Elizabeth Banks has turned limp and pointless. If you think it's hysterical to see a bear do a bump off a severed leg stump, by all means, the movie theater is this way.











            But where does it all go from here? Just match an apex predator with a Schedule II drug and fall deeper into a movie future with “Oxycodone Osprey"" or “Codeine Crocodile”?

            The best thing to say is that, even at an efficient 95 minutes, “Cocaine Bear” just snorts along. When a drug runner in a plane in 1985 drops an outstanding amount of cocaine on Blood Mountain in Georgia, a 500-pound black bear ingests a brick of it and naturally wants more (At this point, we must call it Pablo Escobear, right?).

            Unfortunately, there are different groups of people who happen to be in the woods at the same time — a pair of European backpackers, a teen and her friends skipping school for a hike, a trio of thugs, a pair of park ranger types, the drug runner's associates and a cop on the hunt.

            The movie stars Keri Russell, Isiah Whitlock Jr., Margo Martindale, Kristofer Hivju, O’Shea Jackson Jr., Alden Ehrenreich and the late Ray Liotta. All deserve hazard pay. This is not a career high.

            Eagle-eyed viewers will note that the presence of Russell and Martindale plus a cameo from Matthew Rhys combines three members of the Cold War-era spy TV series “The Americans.” That's an indication of the kind of meta humor here.

            There's a reference to Pines Mall, which is a little nod to “Back to the Future,” but who really cares? “Jane,” the opening song, is an homage to ”Wet Hot American Summer,” which Banks co-starred in and had the same Jefferson Starship opening tune. Looking for Easter eggs takes your mind of the meandering script.

            Banks and screenwriter Jimmy Warden have created a mashup of Quentin Tarantino bloodfests, Sam Raimi's scare tactics and the Coen brothers' absurdity. The bear will sneak up behind its victims, race silently, leap in slo-mo, luxuriate under a dust cloud of coke, behead enemies, climb trees and walk on its hind legs, snarling. If only it snorted enough coke to stay up all night and write a better plot.

            The filmmakers are also clearly trying their hand at satire, but ham-fistedly. Set during the Reagan-era “Just Say No” period, “Cocaine Bear” hopes to remark on the demonization of drugs and it also seems to have something to say about how humans misunderstand the balance of nature. Neither work.

            If you want to use a bear to talk about larger things, look no further than 1997's dark “The Edge,” with a screenplay by David Mamet exploring masculinity and intellectualism, or even 1988's light “The Bear,” about the nobleness of creatures — it even has a bear cub eating hallucination-inducing mushrooms. “Cocaine Bear” is like a dull butter knife against those two. 

            Remarkably, no real bears were used this time. Weta FX, the New Zealand-based special effects company founded by Peter Jackson, supplied the massive flaked-up and all-digital ursine, complete with a mangled ear and scars on its snout. The soundtrack is pure '80s — Scandal’s ""The Warrior,"" Berlin's ""No More Words"" and Depeche Mode's very appropriate “Just Can't Get Enough.”

            And in another bit of trickery, “Cocaine Bear” was shot largely in rural Ireland, which the creators say closely resembles the Georgia mountain wilderness. Actually, that reminds us of what else bears famously do in the woods. These filmmakers left us a pile of it. 

            “Cocaine Bear,” a Universal Pictures release that hits theaters Friday, is rated R for “bloody violence and gore, drug content and language throughout.” Running time: 95 minutes. Zero stars out of four.

            “That EGOT is definitely on the list,” said the music megastar. While artists often downplay their desire to win awards, Usher has always sought to be intentional.

            “That’s a goal in life. I’ve acted on Broadway. I’ve acted in movies. I’m now producing,” said the multi-hyphenate performer, referring to the rare entertainer who’s won an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony award. Part two of his confessions? Accepting a Grammy during the televised portion of the show, something that surprisingly hasn’t happened.











            “I’ve never actually received a Grammy on stage in front of an audience. That is a goal of mine,” said the eight-time winner. “I want that moment.”

            The R&B singer spoke while promoting “Usher: My Way The Vegas Residency,” which just added new June and October dates going on sale Saturday. In addition to showcasing hits from his massive catalog, Usher's residency celebrates the 25th anniversary of his 1997 sophomore album “My Way” which catapulted him into stardom. The 15 additional dates at the 5,200-seat Dolby Live at Park MGM theater were added due to high demand — which doesn't surprise Usher.

            “I think that there’s an audience that needs to be served with what I offer as an artist and what I think historically needs to be seen in this city. Back in 1955, when performers came to the city and they did performances, they could not walk through those casinos. They could not even set foot in the same spaces as the people that they were performing for,” he said, referring to a racially segregated America. “We’re on the other side of that history, but yet and still, there isn’t the same celebration of our culture in that way … So that history is part of the reason that I say, no, I wasn’t surprised.”

            A respecter of the past, Usher believes he’s helping move Black entertainment forward in the same way legendary performers before him helped make this residency possible.

            “I’m carrying a torch that’s far bigger than just me, man. It’s Lena Horne. It’s Sammy Davis Jr. It’s Luther Vandross … there’s a bigger thing that’s behind what I’m doing, and it’s not just about what we’re looking at right now,” said the 44-year-old who released his debut album at just 15. “I’m a pop-R&B artist who makes hip-hop influenced cultural things, but I do come from the soul and the entertainment of R&B. That was underserved and (the residency) was needed in this time.” 

            Identifying himself as a pop-R&B hybrid is significant as his Super Bowl-worthy cache was recently debated among fans and social media users. After Rihanna’s celebrated performance earlier this month, some online users questioned if Usher, whose catalog includes classic R&B songs like “Confessions, Pt. II,”“Yeah!” and “Nice & Slow,” along with pop smashes like “ OMG ” and “ DJ Got Us Fallin’ In Love, ” could headline a solo halftime show. (He made an appearance in the 2011 Super Bowl show headlined by the Black Eyed Peas.)

            Many found it preposterous that an artist who danced on stage with Michael Jackson, sang at Kobe Bryant’s memorial service and is considered one of the greatest of his generation would even be questioned — and it seems Usher might share that sentiment.

            “What I am thankful for is the fact that there’s even any conversation about me — period. I feel humbled that at this age and this juncture of my life, people still have to ask the question, (even) after all of the No. 1s that I’ve had and all the diamond (selling songs), that I have enough records to perform 15 minutes,” he said with a laugh. “If I were ever asked to perform at the Super Bowl, of course I would definitely be into it.”

            Despite demand for his Las Vegas show, could some be unaware or forgetful of his catalog?

            “My concern is to make certain that they don’t have a reason to. So I continue to make these kind offers that are music, and also to perform and entertain because that’s just what I love to do. What people would maybe feel about me is not my concern. What I feel about me is my concern,” Usher explained. “What I do for you is my concern. And I’m happy and I’m in a great place.”

            On Valentine’s Day, Usher released a video teaser starring socialite Lori Harvey for his upcoming song “GLU.” Usher is prepping his ninth studio album that he says will be released “sooner than later."" It will be his first album since 2016’s “Hard II Love.” 

            Usher is enjoying the consistency his residency provides, especially as an involved father. Tour life can be hectic and exhausting, so stability is currently a non-negotiable. He’s even began looking into headlining residencies internationally.

            “I like the idea of what I’ve found in Las Vegas. It gives me an opportunity to settle. I have children now. I got a life, so (I like) being able to have a few days in certain places and being able to celebrate those places and enjoy them,” he said. “At this age, you try to hold on to the moments.” ___

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819893,Court rejects deception charges against Savers Value Village,"SEATTLE (AP) — The Washington state Supreme Court handed the thrift store chain Savers Value Village a unanimous win Thursday in a long-running legal fight with Attorney General Bob Ferguson, finding that its marketing practices constitute protected free speech.

            The attorney general’s office began investigating the company eight years ago and, after Savers Value Village declined to pay millions of dollars to settle the investigation, Ferguson sued. 

            The state alleged that the thrift chain — which is based in Bellevue, Washington, and operates 316 stores in the U.S., Canada and Australia — had created an impression that it was a nonprofit or charitable organization and that purchases at its stores directly benefited charities. 











            In reality, it’s a for-profit company that pays charitable organizations for donations, but it does not provide the charities a direct cut of retail sales. The justices ruled 9-0 Thursday that the company’s marketing practices were protected by the U.S. Constitution.

            While commercial speech is given less protection than other messages under the First Amendment, Savers Value Village's marketing was so wrapped up in promoting the charities it worked with that it was entitled to full protection, Justice Mary Yu wrote for the court.

            Rich Medway, the company’s general counsel and chief compliance officer, said Thursday the state offered no evidence that Savers Value Village intended to deceive the public or that any consumer was harmed by its marketing practices.

            Two of the major charities it works with in Washington — Northwest Center, which supports people with disabilities, and Big Brothers Big Sisters of Puget Sound — had urged the attorney general's office to drop the case and filed a friend-of-the-court brief on the thrift chain's behalf.

            Savers Value Village paid $580 million to charitable partners globally in the last five years and kept 3.2 billion pounds of goods out of landfills, according to Medway.

            “It’s hard to understand, with a business model like ours that is so positive … why the attorney general decided to pursue this for eight years,” he said. “It’s a model that should be celebrated.”

            Savers Value Village did agree to register as a commercial fundraiser at the attorney general’s insistence, after previously being told by the secretary of state’s office that it did not need to. By 2015 it also posted signs in its stores disclosing its status as a for-profit commercial fundraiser and had employees make periodic in-store announcements to that effect.

            In an emailed statement, Ferguson said his office was disappointed in the ruling and noted the court never disputed that the company’s marketing misled customers.

            “We are proud that our investigation led Value Village to change its marketing practices and more clearly disclose that it is a for-profit company,” Ferguson said.

            The lawsuit wasn't the first time the thrift chain's marketing practices had been challenged. In 2015, it reached a settlement with Minnesota's attorney general in which it agreed to overhaul its donation and disclosure practices. It also paid $1.8 million to six Minnesota charities to compensate them for lost income during that case.

            Fourteen states, including Minnesota, filed a friend-of-the-court brief on Washington's behalf, arguing that authorities must be able to protect consumers from deceptive marketing practices because public trust is crucial to to the work charities do.

            “The practice of for-profit companies masquerading as charities is therefore a significant threat to the public and the charitable sector,” they wrote.SEATTLE (AP) — The Washington state Supreme Court handed the thrift store chain Savers Value Village a unanimous win Thursday in a long-running legal fight with Attorney General Bob Ferguson, finding that its marketing practices constitute protected free speech.The attorney general’s office began investigating the company eight years ago and, after Savers Value Village declined to pay millions of dollars to settle the investigation, Ferguson sued.The state alleged that the thrift chain — which is based in Bellevue, Washington, and operates 316 stores in the U.S., Canada and Australia — had created an impression that it was a nonprofit or charitable organization and that purchases at its stores directly benefited charities.In reality, it’s a for-profit company that pays charitable organizations for donations, but it does not provide the charities a direct cut of retail sales. The justices ruled 9-0 Thursday that the company’s marketing practices were protected by the U.S. Constitution.While commercial speech is given less protection than other messages under the First Amendment, Savers Value Village's marketing was so wrapped up in promoting the charities it worked with that it was entitled to full protection, Justice Mary Yu wrote for the court.Rich Medway, the company’s general counsel and chief compliance officer, said Thursday the state offered no evidence that Savers Value Village intended to deceive the public or that any consumer was harmed by its marketing practices.Two of the major charities it works with in Washington — Northwest Center, which supports people with disabilities, and Big Brothers Big Sisters of Puget Sound — had urged the attorney general's office to drop the case and filed a friend-of-the-court brief on the thrift chain's behalf.Savers Value Village paid $580 million to charitable partners globally in the last five years and kept 3.2 billion pounds of goods out of landfills, according to Medway.“It’s hard to understand, with a business model like ours that is so positive … why the attorney general decided to pursue this for eight years,” he said. “It’s a model that should be celebrated.”Savers Value Village did agree to register as a commercial fundraiser at the attorney general’s insistence, after previously being told by the secretary of state’s office that it did not need to. By 2015 it also posted signs in its stores disclosing its status as a for-profit commercial fundraiser and had employees make periodic in-store announcements to that effect.In an emailed statement, Ferguson said his office was disappointed in the ruling and noted the court never disputed that the company’s marketing misled customers.“We are proud that our investigation led Value Village to change its marketing practices and more clearly disclose that it is a for-profit company,” Ferguson said.The lawsuit wasn't the first time the thrift chain's marketing practices had been challenged. In 2015, it reached a settlement with Minnesota's attorney general in which it agreed to overhaul its donation and disclosure practices. It also paid $1.8 million to six Minnesota charities to compensate them for lost income during that case.Fourteen states, including Minnesota, filed a friend-of-the-court brief on Washington's behalf, arguing that authorities must be able to protect consumers from deceptive marketing practices because public trust is crucial to to the work charities do.“The practice of for-profit companies masquerading as charities is therefore a significant threat to the public and the charitable sector,” they wrote.",2023/02/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819894,Boeing plans to end production of 'Top Gun' plane in 2025,"Even “Top Gun” couldn't save the F/A-18 Super Hornet. 

            Boeing announced Thursday that it expects to end production of the fighter jet in late 2025 after a final delivery to the U.S. Navy.

            Production of the plane could be stretched out to 2027 if India places an order, the company said.











            The first F/A-18 debuted in 1983 and was built by McDonnell Douglas, which merged with Boeing in 1997. More than 2,000 Hornets, Super Hornets and Growlers have been delivered to the U.S. military and the governments of many allies, including Canada, Finland, Australia and Malaysia.

            But the plane's fate has been in doubt in recent years. The Navy had planned not to buy any Super Hornets after fall 2021, citing the age of the plane’s design. Only an act of Congress kept production running. 

            News of the plane's curtain call comes less than a month after Boeing delivered the last of its iconic 747 jumbo jet that has been used in passenger and cargo service for half a century.

            Boeing said ending F/A-18 production will let it focus on future military aircraft, both crewed and uncrewed, and increase production of other defense programs. The company said it plans to build three new facilities in St. Louis, where the F/A-18s are assembled.

            “We are planning for our future, and building fighter aircraft is in our DNA,” said Steve Nordlund, vice president of Boeing's Air Dominance division.

            The company said it will continue to develop upgrades to the current fleet of F/A-18 Super Hornets and EA-18G Growlers. The latter is a carrier-based electronic version of the jet.

            The Super Hornet featured prominently in the 2022 movie “Top Gun: Maverick,” with Tom Cruise reprising his role in a 1980s movie about a Navy pilot. The sequel got positive reviews and was among the highest-grossing movies of last year.Even “Top Gun” couldn't save the F/A-18 Super Hornet.Boeing announced Thursday that it expects to end production of the fighter jet in late 2025 after a final delivery to the U.S. Navy.Production of the plane could be stretched out to 2027 if India places an order, the company said.The first F/A-18 debuted in 1983 and was built by McDonnell Douglas, which merged with Boeing in 1997.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819897,"Prada, Emporio Armani, Max Mara promote modesty in Milan","MILAN (AP) — Milan designers took a more modest turn on the second day of Milan Fashion Week of mostly womenswear looks for next fall and winter. 

            If the first day of shows bared skin, the second day offered options that allow women to dial up or dial down how much they reveal. 

            Some highlights from Thursday's shows on the second day of Milan Fashion Week of mostly womenswear previews for next fall and winter: 











            PRADA PLAYS WITH COUTURE AND EVERYDAY

            Brides and nurses get their due in the latest Prada collection by co-creative directors Miuccia Prada and Raf Simons. 

            The unifying theme was caring something the designers suggest is in short supply in a world where wars continue to rage. 

            Prada said that the pair wanted to give importance to modest, purposeful looks, not just ‘’extreme glamour.’’ ""Beauty is in everyday things,'' she added. 

            A white uniform dress hugged the body, elevating with couture details something ordinary usually picked up in a workman’s shop. While suggesting a uniform with a stiff collar, button down front and waist pockets, details like a trailing train are more form over function. 

            ‘’Why not give importance to garments that people wear in the real life,’’ Simons said backstage, and not just relegate uniforms to workwear shops. 

            Conversely, the designers intend a series of white skirts, from mini to flouncy with 3D floral detailing, as wedding wear, transforming one-day occasion piece into a quotidian affair. Underlining its fresh utility, the white skirts were paired with sturdy pullovers and blazers. 

            The collection draws strongly on themes launched in the menswear look previewed last month. There is an emphasis on architecture in the outwear, but with a more feminine touch. Cropped capes with military detailing offered a fresh silhouette, as did duffle coats with unexpected volumes on the back. 

            Perhaps the most adaptable of the runway uniforms were the pencil trousers worn with ribbed knit-wear and pumps, some with a flat wing-like accents. They were shown in fetching color combinations like pink and seafoam green. And the long uniform dressers reappeared in silken prints with small trains, perfect for an evening out. 

            Front row guests included Dua Lipa, Sienna Miller, May Ray Thurman Hawke and Jeon So-Mi. Fans of the Chinese singer Kun thronged outside. 

            THE EMPORIO ARMANI CIRCUS

            Models circling the Emporio Armani runway actually smiled, not the usual runway look. But then it is not every day that a light-hearted, fun-infused collection invites them to do so. 

            Small bowler hats seemed to set the almost vaudevillian mood of the collection, which was underlined by asymmetrically buttoned jackets, organza skirts in multi-toned layers, and big disco-ball sequined cocktail dresses catching the light and attention. The jocularity alo came through in sheer blouses with bright rounded collars, tiny bags hanging off straps and ribboned necklines accenting velvet suits. 

            “There is a little bit of everything but in the service of one thing: Discretion in showing a slightly eccentric fashion,’’ Armani said after the show. 

            The 88-year-old designer admitted that he had fun, adding with a laugh: “But I’m exhausted.’’

            ____

            BLUEMARINE’S WARRIOR 

            Bluemarine creative director Nicola Brognano showed his collection against the backdrop of a burning letter B, set among stone ruins. 

            That the Bluemarine woman for next season is a warrior was clear in the liquidy metallic form-fitting dresses as well as tunic-and-slack combinations. Long metallic chainmail dresses were worn over studded leather panties. 

            Shearling coats and accents finished the looks, exerting boldness.

            MOSCHINO’S NONCONFORMISM 

            Jeremy Scott’s latest Moschino collection was a little less literal than usual, but that is not to say it was subtle. 

            Scott codeswitched from surrealism to punk, declaring his punk intentions with exaggerated spiked wigs worn by all the models. Opening looks played with the surrealism of Salvador Dali, with houndstooth patterns that appeared to be melting, and wavy hemlines on jackets and skirts giving the same surrealistic effect. 

            The looks veered into pure punk with jackets and skirts covered with spikes and accented with mesh, and then adorned with bejeweled broaches for an aristo-punk vibe, that culminated with a tulle princess dress worn with bejeweled opera gloves. There was a Mardi Gras moment with bejeweled bra top and sequined and beaded dress. Shoes featured zig-zag heels. 

            “It’s a rebellion tinged with surrealism, and infused with a dash of non-conformist royalty,’’ the designer said in notes. 

            MAX MARA DECLARES A ‘CAMELOCRACY’

            Max Mara’s creative director Ian Griffiths is nothing if not tongue-in-cheek about the Italian brand’s affinity for monochromes, above all in a neutral camel. This season, he both fills the runway with it, and overturns it, with looks in very brand-bending brocade and jacquards. 

            The collection was broadly inspired by 18th Century court costumes, seen in soft, dressing gown coats with pretty gathered details, wide panier skirts kept short, and pretty velvet ribbons tied in the hair. 

            Griffiths added modern touches like silhouette-defining thick belts to avoid creating a ""BBC costume drama,'' he said. The jacquards and brocades within the Max Mara camel-colored universe ""give you a kind of swashbuckling cavalier feel,'' the designer said. 

            Griffiths said he puts the dignity of the Max Mara woman at the center of his collections, and is mindful of the global market with varying standards of modesty. 

            ""My interpretation of dignity is what I showed today: Clothes that show whosever wearing them in their best light, to show off their beauty but in a way that never degrades them in any way,'' Griffiths said. “I feel pain for women who choose, or for one reason or another find themselves having to wear something they probably fell in love with on the runway and then spent the whole day or night just constantly thinking, ‘Am I a young enough or thin enough?’”

            SOUTHWEST INSPO AT ROBERTO CAVALLI

            Fausto Puglisi’s latest collection for Roberto Cavalli could populate the Coachella music festival, with western-inspired elements and rock ‘n’ roll ethos. 

            The sexy looks included patchwork leather skirts, super slim lace body suits and jeans with elephant legs worn with silken printed shirts that slide easily off the body. Flowing dresses bared backs and midriffs, but could be covered with patchwork leather jackets with star motifs as the sun goes down. Turquoise studded jewelry accented the looks. 

            The collection fit well into a Milan Fashion Week runway that invites people to show off skin, even in the fall and winter.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819898,New Orleans recall drive demands newspaper pay for petitions,"NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Organizers of an effort to recall New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell have demanded $15,000 from the The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate to comply with a court agreement to give the city's daily newspaper copies of the signed petitions, the paper reported. 

            An attorney for Nolatoya.org told The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate on Wednesday that it must pay $1 per page — about $15,000 — for the signatures, which are public record under state law, the news organization reported.

            Nolatoya.org began a petition drive in August seeking to recall Cantrell, New Orleans' first female mayor. Cantrell's second term has been plagued by myriad problems, including stubborn violent crime, fitful progress on major street projects that have left some city streets a mess, and unreliable garbage collection. Questions also have been raised about her travel expenses and her personal use of a city-owned apartment.











            The newspaper sued organizer Eileen Carter after Nolatoya.org declined to release signatures to the newspaper during the petition drive. Her lawyers argued that voters who signed the petition had a “reasonable expectation of privacy"" and that revealing their names could expose them to retaliation. 

            Under a court agreement signed Feb. 8, recall leaders said they would provide the newspaper with a copy of their petitions by 5 p.m. Wednesday — the deadline for submitting them to the Orleans Parish registrar of voters for verification. The agreement on file at New Orleans' Civil District Court doesn't mention a fee.

            But after organizers turned in their petitions to the registrar, they sent the newspaper a letter from attorney Laura Rodrigue stating that it must pay for the signatures, the newspaper reported. Rodrigue told the newspaper that Louisiana law allows for the collection of reasonable fees for the production of public records.

            Carter, who signed the court agreement, did not immediately return a call from The Associated Press seeking comment Thursday.NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Organizers of an effort to recall New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell have demanded $15,000 from the The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate to comply with a court agreement to give the city's daily newspaper copies of the signed petitions, the paper reported.An attorney for Nolatoya.org told The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate on Wednesday that it must pay $1 per page — about $15,000 — for the signatures, which are public record under state law, the news organization reported.Nolatoya.org began a petition drive in August seeking to recall Cantrell, New Orleans' first female mayor.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819902,Emotional outburst disrupts death penalty trial in NY attack,"NEW YORK (AP) — Emotions ran high Thursday in death penalty proceedings for a man convicted of killing eight people on a New York City bike path, as the man’s father professed both shame and love for his son and the defendant’s uncle shouted “dirty ISIS bastards!” and punched a door as he left the room.

            Habibulloh Saipov’s testimony in Manhattan federal court and the subsequent outburst came in front of a jury that must decide whether Sayfullo Saipov gets death or life in prison for the Halloween day attack in 2017, when he drove a truck along the busy path near the World Trade Center memorial, mowing down pedestrians and cyclists.

            “I'm sorry that this has occurred,” Judge Vernon S. Broderick said after the jury left the room. He expressed concern at the effect the dramatic turn might have on jurors and warned defense lawyers to ensure there was no repeat of such behavior. Testimony did not resume for two hours.











            “That we’re disappointed at that is an understatement,” lawyer David Patton told the judge. Broderick later banned the uncle from the courthouse.

            The death penalty phase began after the same jury last month convicted Sayfullo Saipov, 35, who throughout the trial has slumped in his chair and appeared unrepentant and unemotional. 

            But he perked up as his father, whom he only recently saw for the first time in 13 years, took the stand to decry the terror attack, saying it has left the family ashamed.

            When asked by defense attorney David Stern how he reacted to his son’s attack, Habibulloh Saipov said: “My soul was destroyed.”

            “He committed a terrible tragedy. He caused death for eight people and injuries for many more and he ruined their lives,” Saipov said.

            “How do you feel about what he did?” Stern asked.

            “I feel very bad about this. And I would like to apologize in front of everyone, all victims,” he continued.

            Habibulloh Saipov testified that he once told his son after working in the United States for five years that “people there are sincere and they are always smiling to each other.”

            When the son came to the country in 2010 and began working as a truck driver, the father said they frequently had hourslong conversations to keep him awake on long hauls.

            Habibulloh Saipov cried as he recounted learning that his son had carried out the attack and seeing his wife collapse and faint after seeing images of the aftermath on her phone. He said he was then subjected to 15 days of interrogation by law enforcement.

            At one point, Sayfullo Saipov pulled his coronavirus mask away from his face to wipe around his eyes as his father cried.

            The father also told of phone calls in which Sayfullo Saipov bragged that he should feel lucky to have a son who had done something heroic.

            “Do you feel lucky to have a son who did what he did?” Stern asked.

            “No, not at all,” the father answered.

            Habibulloh Saipov acknowledged that he’ll likely never see his son again after he returns to his country, Uzbekistan, on Friday.

            Asked if he still loves him, he said, “With all my heart.”

            He added that he hopes his son is spared the death penalty so he’ll realize the truth about his crimes.

            The outburst from the uncle and another shout from an unidentified woman left a family member of one victim sobbing as the judge summoned a nurse. He also directed that Sayfullo Saipov be checked.

            The words “dirty ISIS bastards” were relayed by an interpreter at the judge's request. The interpreter said whatever else was said by anyone was unintelligible.

            Sayfullo Saipov told investigators following his arrest that he carried out the killings after the Islamic State group called for terror attacks.

            Testimony resumed after a long break, and the judge instructed jurors that the uncle's outburst was not directed at the court, jury, prosecutors, defense or trial process.

            Hamidulloh Saipov, another uncle, testified that he too still loves his nephew, though he believes he did “something wrong, something unbelievable.” 

            “He broke everybody’s hearts. He broke our heart,” the uncle said. “Everybody was shocked. Everybody was sick.”

            He said Sayfullo Saipov had changed due to being “influenced by bad people” and added that he hopes his nephew “will get back to himself.”

President Joe Biden announced the choice on Thursday, crediting Banga with critical experience on global challenges including climate change. The news comes days after Trump appointee David Malpass announced plans to step down in June from his role leading the 189-nation poverty reduction agency. Malpass ran into criticism last year for comments seeming to cast doubt on the science that says the burning of fossil fuels causes global warming. Malpass later apologized.

            US revises down last quarter’s economic growth to 2.7% rate

            WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. economy expanded at a 2.7% annual rate from October through December, a solid showing despite rising interest rates and elevated inflation, the government said in a downgrade from its initial estimate. The government had previously estimated that the economy grew at a 2.9% annual rate last quarter. The Commerce Department’s revised estimate of last quarter’s gross domestic product — the economy’s total output of goods and services — marked a deceleration from the 3.2% growth rate from July through September. While overall growth was solid in the fourth quarter, business spending barely rose, and consumers spent cautiously, suggesting that the economy lost momentum at the end of 2022.

            TikTok banned from EU Commission phones over cybersecurity

            LONDON (AP) — The European Union’s executive branch has temporarily banned TikTok from phones used by employees as a cybersecurity measure. The move reflects widening worries from Western officials over the Chinese-owned video sharing app. The European Commission said Thursday that it suspended the use of TikTok on devices issued to staff or personal devices that staff use for work. It follows similar moves in the U.S., where more than half of the states and Congress have banned TikTok from official government devices. European Commission staffers are required to delete TikTok from private devices that they use for professional business by March 15. TikTok’s Brussels-based public policy official tweeted that the suspension “is misguided and based on fundamental misconceptions.”

            NEW YORK (AP) — Stocks climbed after a see-saw day on Wall Street to break out of their longest losing streak since December. The S&P 500 rose 0.5% Thursday for its first gain in five days. Tech stocks helped lead the way after Nvidia reported better results for the latest quarter than expected. It’s a turnaround for tech and high-growth stocks, which have struggled recently because of worries about rising interest rates. They’re seen as some of the most vulnerable as the Federal Reserve jacks rates higher in hopes of stamping out inflation. Treasury yields fell Thursday to take some pressure of the stock market.

            NEW YORK (AP) — The founder of the troubled digital start-up Ozy Media has been arrested on fraud charges as part of what prosecutors say was a scheme to prop up the financially struggling company. Carlos Watson was to be arraigned in a federal court in Brooklyn Thursday afternoon. The company hemorrhaged millions of dollars before it shut down amid revelations of possibly deceptive business practices. The arrest came after two of the company’s top executives pleaded guilty this month to fraud charges. Ozy’s then-chief operating officer, Samir Rao, allegedly impersonated a YouTube executive during a pitch to Goldman Sachs, a potential investor.

            ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) — Boeing says it expects to end production of the F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jet in late 2025. That’s the plane that starred in last year’s movie, “Top Gun: Maverick,” with Tom Cruise playing a Navy pilot. Boeing says it expects to deliver the last F/A-18 to the U.S. Navy, then shut down the assembly line. The company says the plane could get two extra years of production if India puts in an order. The F/A-18 debuted in 1983 from McDonnell Douglas, and more than 2,000 of them have been built since then.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819905,"Brook, Root put England in charge in 2nd test vs New Zealand","WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — Harry Brook made 184 and Joe Root 101 in an unbroken fourth-wicket partnership of 294 which carried England to 315-3 at stumps Friday on the rain-shortened first day of the second cricket test against New Zealand.

            A day which began without promise with a lost toss and three early wickets ended after only 65 overs and after a parade of records and milestones which saw England take almost unbreakable control of the match and series.

            Brook’s score was his highest in tests, beating his 153 against Pakistan in December, and was his fourth century in his last five tests. He also has three half centuries and now has 807 runs from only nine test innings, more than any other player in the history of test cricket at that point in their careers.











            Behind him now are players such as Henry Sutcliff, Everton Weekes, Frank Worrell and Sunil Gavaskar. His score already is the highest by an England batsman in Wellington.

            Brook said he went to the crease with England 21-3 with “just the usual mindset, just the way I’ve been playing the whole time I’ve been playing test cricket to be honest.

            “I looked to put pressure on the bowler and be as positive as possible,” he said. ""I did change a few little things but the more positive you are generally the more you get away with.”

            Root has his 29th test century, completing the milestone a moment before the rain began. The partnership between Yorkshiremen now is England’s highest for the fourth wicket against New Zealand.

            England reinforced the superiority over New Zealand the visitors showed in the first test which they won by 267 runs and they now look likely to become the first team to beat New Zealand in a test series at home for six years.

            Brook was man in the match for his scores of 89 and 54 in the first test, both of which were made at better than a run a ball and helped take that match away from New Zealand.

            The home team had only a few days to regroup from that mauling and were reinforced Friday by the return of fast bowler Matt Henry and batsman Will Young while England happily named an unchanged side.

            New Zealand would have been happy when it won the toss and bowled first, more so when Henry and Tim South had early success and England stumbled to 21-3 in less than seven overs.

            Then came Brook and once again the match was transformed. His first half century was sedate by his standards, coming from 51 balls and his century came from 107 deliveries, the second 50 from 56 balls. He then went on to 150 from 145 balls, having stepping up his and England’s scoring. The third half century needed only 38 balls and was a trial for New Zealand who saw the match slipping away.

            New Zealand had taken the risk of playing with an extra batsman, perhaps motivated by the dual failure of their top order in the first test. That left them with the all-rounder Daryl Mitchell as their third seamer, bowling relatively unthreatening medium pace.

            And they went again with Neil Wagner who England milked for 192 runs from just over 29 overs in the first test.

            Brook might have shown some caution at the start of the innings after seeing Zac Crawley, Ben Duckett and Ollie Pope all fall to catches behind the wicket.

            But after a settling in period he approached his innings with typical forcefulness while Root provided him unwavering support.

            More AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsWELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — Harry Brook made 184 and Joe Root 101 in an unbroken fourth-wicket partnership of 294 which carried England to 315-3 at stumps Friday on the rain-shortened first day of the second cricket test against New Zealand.A day which began without promise with a lost toss and three early wickets ended after only 65 overs and after a parade of records and milestones which saw England take almost unbreakable control of the match and series.Brook’s score was his highest in tests, beating his 153 against Pakistan in December, and was his fourth century in his last five tests. He also has three half centuries and now has 807 runs from only nine test innings, more than any other player in the history of test cricket at that point in their careers.Behind him now are players such as Henry Sutcliff, Everton Weekes, Frank Worrell and Sunil Gavaskar. His score already is the highest by an England batsman in Wellington.Brook said he went to the crease with England 21-3 with “just the usual mindset, just the way I’ve been playing the whole time I’ve been playing test cricket to be honest.“I looked to put pressure on the bowler and be as positive as possible,” he said. ""I did change a few little things but the more positive you are generally the more you get away with.”Root has his 29th test century, completing the milestone a moment before the rain began. The partnership between Yorkshiremen now is England’s highest for the fourth wicket against New Zealand.England reinforced the superiority over New Zealand the visitors showed in the first test which they won by 267 runs and they now look likely to become the first team to beat New Zealand in a test series at home for six years.Brook was man in the match for his scores of 89 and 54 in the first test, both of which were made at better than a run a ball and helped take that match away from New Zealand.The home team had only a few days to regroup from that mauling and were reinforced Friday by the return of fast bowler Matt Henry and batsman Will Young while England happily named an unchanged side.New Zealand would have been happy when it won the toss and bowled first, more so when Henry and Tim South had early success and England stumbled to 21-3 in less than seven overs.Then came Brook and once again the match was transformed. His first half century was sedate by his standards, coming from 51 balls and his century came from 107 deliveries, the second 50 from 56 balls.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819906,Utah lawmakers punt on magic mushroom therapy proposal,"SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — A pilot program in Utah that would have allowed thousands of patients to consume psychedelic mushrooms for therapeutic use failed to advance in the state Senate on Wednesday, effectively ending its chances of passage as lawmakers prepare to adjourn for the year next week.

            The Senate's health and human services committee neither advanced nor rejected the measure, with Republican leaders proposing more time to examine the issue.

            Even if it had advanced for further discussion, the proposal likely would've faced an “uphill battle” getting passed this year, said State Sen. Jake Anderegg, a Lehi Republican, based on his talks with lawmakers.











            Utah was among several states across the political spectrum considering the use of psychedelic mushrooms this year. Proponents hoped the success of the state’s medical marijuana regulations could sway members of the Republican-supermajority statehouse to adopt a similar framework.

            Advocates representing patients and libertarian-leaning groups initially hoped a narrow proposal focused on health care and safety could gain traction. But the proposal's chances diminished last week when Gov. Spencer Cox and Senate President Stuart Adams voiced opposition — less than a week after state Sen. Luz Escamilla, a Salt Lake City Democrat, introduced it.

            The pilot program would have let 5,000 patients suffering from mental illnesses including post-traumatic stress, depression and anxiety to consume magic mushrooms under a therapist’s supervision. She argued it would add resources to address Utah’s high suicide rates and mental health practitioner shortage.

            “It’s just not there yet,” Cox said last week regarding Escamilla's proposed pilot program. “We got there with medical marijuana. I just don’t believe the science is there” regarding psychedelics.

            “I think there are some serious consequences and side effects societally as well as as well as medically that I’m just not comfortable with,” said Cox, who is up for reelection next year.

            Lawmakers' decision to not advance the proposal without significant discussion comes one year after they greenlit a Republican-sponsored measure creating a task force to study mental illness and the therapeutic use certain drugs including magic mushrooms. In October, the task force released a report that noted the potential benefits of mushrooms, yet recommended Utah wait until the federal Food and Drug Administration complete its fast-tracked drug approval review before taking additional action on psychedelic-assisted therapy.

            Psychedelics including magic mushrooms remain illegal on a federal level yet several states including Colorado and Oregon have taken steps to decriminalize their possession or legalize their consumption for therapeutic purposes. Proposals to study psychedelics for therapy have gained traction throughout the Untied States including Republican strongholds like Utah, Texas and Missouri.SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — A pilot program in Utah that would have allowed thousands of patients to consume psychedelic mushrooms for therapeutic use failed to advance in the state Senate on Wednesday, effectively ending its chances of passage as lawmakers prepare to adjourn for the year next week.The Senate's health and human services committee neither advanced nor rejected the measure, with Republican leaders proposing more time to examine the issue.Even if it had advanced for further discussion, the proposal likely would've faced an “uphill battle” getting passed this year, said State Sen.

            Fans of the local team were filmed as they directed monkey chants at the visitors on Wednesday night in Caracas.

            The governing body on Thursday called the actions “absolutely unacceptable.”











            The match ended 0-0 and second leg will be played on March 1 in Brazil.

            Several racist incidents took place at last year's Copa Libertadores, many of them targeting Brazilian players at away matches. Most clubs involved had to pay fines when their fans were caught.

            Atletico Mineiro said on Twitter it filed a formal complaint to match organizers. Carabobo also condemned racist fans.

            The four-time winner will take on Al-Duhail on Sunday, after the Qatari team defeated Al-Shabab 2-1 to prevent an all-Saudi Arabian last-four encounter.

            Al-Hilal needed a goal from Moussa Marega three minutes from time to defeat Foolad. The Mali forward fired home a low shot from inside the area.











            Michael Olunga scored both goals as Al-Duhail reached the semifinals for the first time.

            ""Today we beat a strong opponent in Al-Shabab ... and we have enough experience to continue writing history,” the Kenya striker said.

            The winner of the semifinal will take on Urawa Reds of Japan in the two-legged final in April and May.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819913,Longtime leader of American Airlines steps down as chairman,"FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) — American Airlines said Thursday that Doug Parker, who served as CEO for more than eight years before stepping down last year, will retire as chairman on April 30.

            The new chairman will be Greg Smith, who spent more than 30 years at Boeing including the last 10 as chief financial officer. 

            Smith's duties broadened during his tenure at Boeing, including working on the company's effort to return the 737 Max jetliner to service after it was grounded worldwide following two deadly crashes. He briefly served as interim CEO after Dennis Muilenburg was ousted in late 2019.











            Smith, 56, retired from Boeing in a surprise move in early 2021, then joined American’s board in January 2022.

            Parker, 61, was CEO of US Airways when he engineered a 2013 merger that put him and his executive team in charge of American Airlines, which was just emerging from bankruptcy protection. 

            
                Parker's tenure as CEO was mostly a highly profitable period for American, but the airline struggled with more debt than its rivals, even before the pandemic that devastated the U.S. travel industry in early 2020. Also, American's relations with its labor unions worsened, and the federal government sued to kill a partnership with JetBlue in the New York and Boston. Robert Isom succeeded Parker as CEO last March.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819915,1st transgender woman to compete in Puerto Rico pageant,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — A transgender woman has for the first time been selected to participate in the Puerto Rico Miss Universe contest held in the largely conservative U.S. territory.

            Daniela Arroyo González, who is best known for winning a federal lawsuit against Puerto Rico’s government that allows people to change their gender on their birth certificate, was chosen Thursday. It was her second attempt.

            In the April 2018 ruling, U.S. District Court Judge Carmen Consuelo wrote that Arroyo and others who brought the lawsuit “have stepped up for those whose voices, debilitated by raw discrimination, have been hushed into silence. They cannot wait for another generation, hoping for a lawmaker to act.”











            Arroyo also cofounded the Puerto Rico Trans Youth Coalition, a support and networking group.

            Arroyo will compete with other candidates representing the island’s 78 municipalities for the Miss Universe Puerto Rico title.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819916,"Cards add Petzing to lead offense, help Murray's comeback","TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) — The Arizona Cardinals won't have an ideal quarterback situation next season.

            That's a big reason why Drew Petzing was hired.

            New Cardinals head coach Jonathan Gannon has asked Petzing to lead an offense that will eventually be built around franchise quarterback Kyler Murray. The problem is Murray is recovering from tearing the ACL in his right knee and probably won't be available for at least the first few weeks next season.











            This is the first offensive coordinator job for the 35-year-old Petzing. 

            “It creates some unique challenges, but that's the nature of this league,” Petzing said. “No matter what year you're going into, there's going to be something you have to handle and deal with, so it's something we'll work to as a staff.”

            Petzing spent the past three seasons with the Cleveland Browns and was the quarterbacks coach last season. It wasn’t an easy season: Backup Jacoby Brissett played the first 11 games before Deshaun Watson came back from his suspension.

            Even so, the Browns quarterbacks were solid. Brissett started 11 games and threw for 2,608 yards, 12 touchdowns and six interceptions. His 63.9 percent completion rate and 88.9 passer rating were both career highs.

            Watson started the final six games of the season and threw for 1,102 yards, seven TDs and five interceptions. The Browns finished with a 7-10 record and didn't make the playoffs, but Gannon was impressed that the team maintained solid offensive production.

            “Absolutely,” Gannon said. “We definitely talked about that and the process that was put in place in Cleveland. 

            ""Arizona is different, but it was a good little bit of a blueprint to say 'Hey, this is what we did with our guys in Cleveland and this is how we can proceed with Kyler.”

            Petzing has a wide variety of experience on the offensive side of the ball, also coaching tight ends with the Browns and receivers for the Vikings. Gannon and Petzing worked together in Minnesota and would often discuss what they'd do if they ever got the chance to run a team together.

            A few years later, the opportunity is here.

            “A big part of our vision is adapting to the players on the field,” Petzing said. “Making sure we're doing things to put them in position to be successful, to do things that tailor to their strengths, and to make it hard for the defenses we're playing.”

            Petzing has several offensive issues to deal with over the next several months. The Cardinals have to decide if they're bringing back three-time All-Pro receiver DeAndre Hopkins, who is under contract for two more seasons but could be moved to another team.

            There will also be substantial turnover on the offensive line.

            But there's little doubt that the No. 1 issue is Murray's knee injury and his recovery. Even though he's had ups and downs during his four seasons in the NFL, Murray is still just 25 years old and is already a two-time Pro Bowl selection.

            “He's a really talented player,” Petzing said. “That was one of the appealing things about this job to me, being able to work with a quarterback of his caliber. But it's about the entire offense and ultimately the entire team.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819921,NJ fines defiant shore town $12M over unapproved beach work,"NORTH WILDWOOD, N.J. (AP) — The sandstorm being waged between New Jersey environmental officials and a defiant shore town bolstering its dunes without state permission is intensifying.

            The state Department of Environmental Protection said Thursday that it has fined North Wildwood over $12 million for past construction actions along its beachfront, including the destruction of vegetated sand dunes and wetlands, as well as the unauthorized construction of a bulkhead and beachfront amenities including showers and walkways.

            But a long-running dispute at the heart of the litigation might soon come to an end: The last two shore towns that needed to sign on to a full-blown beach replenishment project for the area did so on Wednesday, and an announcement on when the beaches might be widened is expected soon.











            The fines come as the city and the Department of Environmental Protection are fighting in court over more recent emergency repairs North Wildwood made to its beachfront following a significant storm in October — despite a warning from the state not to do so.

            North Wildwood is suing the state for $21 million, the amount it alleges it has had to spend on its own to protect the city and its residents from serious storms over the past decade.

            “Clearly these fines were a retaliatory move after we filed suit against the DEP,” Mayor Patrick Rosenello said. “They created this issue by not doing their job, then when we moved to protect ourselves, they retaliate against us. It really is just one more indication that this whole matter has to be resolved in front of a judge and not through the DEP's administrative procedures.”

            The state declined comment, citing the pending litigation. But it did release copies of three violation notices issued between Jan. 11 and 24 assessing fines for various infractions of state laws and regulations totaling over $12 million.

            One of the most serious involves work the city did several years ago along a section of beachfront that it said had become badly eroded. The state said the work destroyed 8 acres of vegetated dunes, including 6.7 acres of critical wildlife habitat, and 1.1 acres of freshwater wetlands.

            North Wildwood built a vinyl and steel bulkhead for about 10 blocks without state approval, saying it needed to act urgently to protect lives and property.

            It used the same argument in October to make emergency repairs to its dunes two blocks from the earlier work, defying a state prohibition on such work. The state warned that doing the work the city wanted to do — and eventually did — could further damage the beachfront and damage or destroy critical wildlife habitat and coastal ecosystems.

            At issue is the lack of a beach replenishment program that virtually the entire rest of the Jersey Shore has received over the past decade.

            State officials have said such a project could not move forward without necessary approvals from all four beachfront towns that it would affect: North Wildwood and Wildwood Crest, which had previously signed, and Wildwood and Lower Township.

            Those two towns both approved participation in the project on Wednesday, Rosenello said, although the state has not yet announced their agreement.

            Rosenello said the last two towns' approval should clear the way for the kind of comprehensive beach widening and dune construction or restoration project that North Wildwood has been seeking for years.

            The Department of Environmental Protection and North Wildwood are scheduled for a trial in November on their recent dispute, unless it can be amicably resolved before then.

            The rough time and location were the only details finalized as a small group of RNC members met behind closed doors in Washington this week to begin the complicated task of coordinating logistics for what is likely to be a crowded and messy primary season. In the coming weeks, the group plans to finalize a broader set of criteria for participation, including the requirement that each candidate on stage must pledge to support the Republican Party's eventual nominee.

            In selecting Milwaukee, the RNC is following its recent tradition of hosting its inaugural presidential debate in the city playing host to the national convention the following year. 











            “At this time, no other debates have been sanctioned, nor has the final criteria for the first debate been decided,"" GOP Chair Ronna McDaniel wrote in a message to RNC members Thursday. “We have a long way to go, but I am confident we will be able to showcase our eventual nominee in a world class fashion.""

            Three high-profile Republicans have already launched White House bids, but as many as a dozen are ultimately expected to enter the 2024 presidential contest. Already, there are sharp divisions over the future of the party and former President Donald Trump's divisive politics. 

            The committee is considering between 10 and 12 debates between August and its national convention in the summer of 2024. 

            Republican officials are likely to adopt new criteria for participation, including a new donor threshold to demonstrate broad support among the party’s grassroots in addition to a polling threshold of 1% or 2%. 

            Committee officials also met privately this week with more than a dozen media companies to determine the network partners. They include major television networks like CNN, MSNBC and Fox and lower-profile conservative favorites like Newsmax.

            “The committee will continue its work and will release updates as they become available,” McDaniel wrote.NEW YORK (AP) — The opening Republican presidential debate of the 2024 election season will take place in Milwaukee this August, the Republican National Committee decided Thursday.The rough time and location were the only details finalized as a small group of RNC members met behind closed doors in Washington this week to begin the complicated task of coordinating logistics for what is likely to be a crowded and messy primary season.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819923,AP source: Rams parting ways with LB Bobby Wagner,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Linebacker Bobby Wagner is parting ways with the Los Angeles Rams after just one season, a person familiar with the decision said Thursday.

            The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because Wagner's release won't be official until after the start of the new league year next month.

            The 32-year-old Wagner was outstanding in his only season with his hometown Rams, who signed him as a free agent last March following a decade with the Seattle Seahawks.











            Wagner started all 17 games at middle linebacker and made 140 tackles with a career-high six sacks and even two interceptions for the Rams, who went 5-12 in the worst season by a defending Super Bowl champion in NFL history. Los Angeles' defense soundly outperformed its offense throughout the season, with Wagner's strong play and leadership playing major roles while most of the Rams' other star players struggled with major injuries.

            Wagner signed a five-year deal with $20 million guaranteed when he joined Los Angeles, but his release before June 1 will create $5 million in salary cap savings for the Rams, who are currently about $14 million over the cap. His release also results in $7.5 million in dead money, according to Over The Cap.

            Rams middle linebacker Ernest Jones, who played alongside and behind Wagner last season, figures to be Wagner's main replacement. Jones is heading into his third season with Los Angeles.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819928,Russia's war in Ukraine drags into second year with no end in sight,"KYIV, Feb 24 (Reuters) - The war in Ukraine dragged into its second year on Friday, with no end in sight to a conflict launched by Russia that has killed tens of thousands of people, flattened cities and towns, forced millions to flee and brought a Cold War chill to global ties.Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a full-scale invasion of his neighbour on Feb. 24 last year aiming to seize the capital Kyiv quickly and topple the pro-European government, but those hopes were dashed by a fierce defence as well as military blunders that embarrassed Moscow.Ukraine had success with counter-offensives in late 2022 to grab back much of the territory it lost early on, and the war, which Moscow calls a ""special military operation"", has settled into one of attritional trench warfare and rising losses on both sides. Russia controls around a fifth of Ukraine a year on.With Putin signalling a desire to double down on a conflict that prompted tough Western sanctions against his country and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy maintaining a hard line on any potential talks, the prospects of peace appear bleak.The United Nations General Assembly overwhelmingly adopted a resolution marking the war's first anniversary and demanding Moscow withdraw its troops and stop fighting. There were 141 votes in favor and 32 abstentions. Six countries joined Russia to vote no - Belarus, North Korea, Eritrea, Mali, Nicaragua and Syria.China abstained on the vote, just a day after Beijing's top diplomat visited Moscow and pledged a deeper relationship.Russia's Deputy U.N. Ambassador Dmitry Polyanskiy dismissed the action at the United Nations as ""useless"".Zelenskiy posted on Twitter: ""This resolution is a powerful signal of unflagging global support for Ukraine"".Meanwhile, Paris lit up the Eiffel Tower in the Ukrainian flag colours of blue and yellow and people draped in Ukrainian flags gathered at a vigil in London. In Brussels, European Union buildings were similarly lit up in those colours.Reflecting the Kremlin's increasingly hawkish narrative on what became the worst conflict in Europe since World War Two, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu on Thursday cast it as an existential fight against a hostile West.""Using Ukraine, the collective West is seeking to dismember Russia, to deprive it of its independence. These attempts are doomed to fail,"" Shoigu said.Ukraine and its allies led by the United States and Europe dismiss such arguments, casting the invasion as an unjustified land grab aimed at subjugating a sovereign state that has tried to break free from Moscow.U.S. President Joe Biden will meet virtually on Friday with G7 leaders and Zelenskiy to mark the anniversary and announce new sanctions against those aiding Russia's war effort, the White House said.While Europe has tried to wean itself off Russian hydrocarbon exports, Moscow has found willing buyers in China and India, cushioning the blow of sanctions.""The Russian economy and system of governance proved to be much stronger than the West supposed,"" Putin said this week.NEW RUSSIAN MISSILESFurther ratcheting up tensions, Putin announced plans on Thursday to deploy new Sarmat multi-warhead intercontinental ballistic missiles this year. Earlier this week he suspended Russia's participation with the United States in the New START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) on nuclear arms control.Some of the heaviest fighting in recent months has been in and around the eastern city of Bakhmut and, more recently, Vuhledar further south.Hundreds if not thousands of soldiers have died there, even though independent military experts have questioned the strategic value of the locations. Both sides, though, appear determined not to take a step backwards.CONSTANT EXPLOSIONSClose to a Ukrainian tank park near Bakhmut, which has become Russia's main target, constant explosions could be heard echoing in the distance on Thursday.""If we give up Bakhmut, everything else will get even more complicated. We can't give it up, under any circumstance. We will hold through,"" Junior Sergeant Oleh Slavin, a tank operator, told Reuters.A daily evening statement by the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces reported increased Russian activity in the east and south as the anniversary approached. Russian forces also trained fire on at least 25 towns and villages in three northern regions along the Russian border - Chernihiv, Sumy and Kharkiv, the statement said.Reuters was not able to verify battlefield reports.Some U.S. and Western officials estimate Russia's military casualties at nearly 200,000 dead or wounded, while in November the top U.S. general said more than 100,000 troops on each side had been killed or wounded.Battlefield losses are impossible to verify independently, but soldiers fighting on the frontline and military officials have conceded that the death toll has spiked in recent weeks.Thousands of civilians have been killed and Ukrainian prosecutors have reported thousands of allegations of war crimes. Moscow denies targeting civilians and carrying out atrocities.Ukraine has managed to hold its own in the war despite a far smaller army in large part because tens of billions of dollars' worth of increasingly sophisticated military hardware have been shipped in from the United States, Europe and beyond.Zelenskiy has been instrumental in keeping the weapons flowing, hosting Biden in Kyiv on Monday and addressing leaders around the world in person and online.Fears of more Russian missile and drone attacks on Kyiv on Friday to mark the anniversary have kept the capital on edge in recent days, with some schools switching to online learning this week as a precaution.CHINA'S ROLEThe United States is concerned by greater alignment between China and Russia, after Putin on Thursday hailed ""new frontiers"" in ties with Beijing and signalled China's leader Xi Jinping would visit.Washington has said China is considering providing weapons for Russia's war in Ukraine, a move that could intensify the conflict into a confrontation between Russia and China on one side and Ukraine and the U.S.-led NATO military alliance on the other.But Xi is also expected to deliver a ""peace speech"" on Friday, though some analysts have cast doubt on whether Beijing's efforts to act as peacemaker will go beyond rhetoric.",2023/02/24,280,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819931,North Korea says it fired cruise missiles as rivals trained,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea said Friday it test-fired long-range cruise missiles off its eastern coast a day earlier, adding to a provocative streak in weapons demonstrations as its rivals step up military training. 

            The launches, which were later confirmed by South Korea’s military, were intended to verify the reliability of the missiles and the rapid-response capabilities of the unit that operates those weapons, North Korean state media said. 

            The launches took place as the U.S. and South Korea held a simulation in Washington aimed at sharpening their response to North Korean nuclear threats.











            Pyongyang’s official Korean Central News Agency said the four missiles flew for nearly three hours after being launched from the northeastern coast, drew oval and figure-eight patterns above the sea, and showed they can hit targets 2,000 kilometers (1,240 miles) away. 

            South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said the flight details announced by North Korea had discrepancies with the readings by U.S. and South Korean intelligence assets, but it didn’t elaborate. It said the allies were continuing to analyze the launches. 

            Lee Hyojung, spokesperson of Seoul’s Unification Ministry, which handles inter-Korean affairs, denounced North Korea for escalating its testing activity despite signs of deepening economic isolation and food insecurity. 

            North Korea first tested a long-range cruise missile system in September 2021 and has implied the missiles are being developed to be armed with nuclear warheads. 

            It also test-fired an intercontinental ballistic missile Saturday and a pair of short-range missiles Monday to demonstrate a dual ability to conduct nuclear strikes on South Korea and the U.S. mainland. 

            North Korea said Monday’s short-range launches were a response to the United States flying B-1B bombers to the region for joint training with South Korean and Japanese warplanes on Sunday in a show of force following the North’s ICBM test.

            Prior to the ICBM launch, North Korea vowed an “unprecedentedly” strong response over a series of military drills planned by Seoul and Washington. North Korea has described the annual U.S.-South Korea drills as rehearsals for a potential invasion, although the allies say their exercises are defensive in nature. 

            Cruise missiles are among a growing number of North Korean weapons and are designed to be maneuverable in flight to evade defenses. 

            Since the collapse of negotiations with the United States in 2019, North Korea has been accelerating its development of short-range solid-fuel ballistic missiles targeting South Korea, including those that travel on low trajectories that theoretically would be harder to intercept. 

            North Korea is also trying to develop solid-fuel ICBMs, which could be easier to move on vehicles and can be fired faster than the North’s existing liquid-fuel ICBMs, reducing opportunities for opponents to detect the launches and counter them. 

            North Korea is coming off a record year in weapons demonstrations with more than 70 ballistic missiles fired, including ICBMs with potential to reach the U.S. mainland. It also conducted what it described as simulated nuclear attacks against South Korean and U.S. targets.

            Leader Kim Jong Un doubled down on his nuclear push entering 2023, calling for an “exponential increase” in nuclear warheads, mass production of battlefield tactical nuclear weapons targeting “enemy” South Korea and the development of more advanced ICBMs.

            The U.S. Department of Defense and South Korea’s Defense Ministry said their militaries conducted a simulation at the Pentagon on Wednesday that was focused on the possibility of North Korea using nuclear weapons. The allies discussed ways to demonstrate their “strong response capabilities and resolve to response appropriately” to any North Korean nuclear use.

            The Americans during the meeting highlighted the Biden administration’s 2022 Nuclear Posture Review, which states that any nuclear attack by North Korea against the United States or its allies and partners ""will result in the end of that regime,” the U.S. Department of Defense said. It was referring to a legislatively mandated document that spells out U.S. nuclear policy and strategy for the next five to 10 years.

            The U.S. and South Korean delegations also visited Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay in Georgia, where they were briefed on the mission of Ohio-class nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines. U.S. officials at the base described such forces as key means of providing U.S. extended deterrence to allies, referring to a commitment to defend them with the full range of its military capabilities, including nuclear ones.

            Senior North Korean Foreign Ministry official Kwon Jong Gun denounced the allies' simulated exercise and visit to the Georgia submarine base, calling the actions an extension of anti-Pyongyang hostility. Kwon in his statement also complained that the U.N. Security Council held an emergency meeting this week to discuss recent North Korean launches. 

            During the meeting on Monday, the United States and its allies urged the Security Council to condemn the North's unlawful ballistic activities, while China and Russia blamed Washington for raising animosity by stepping up its military exercises targeting Pyongyang. 

            “The U.S. should bear in mind that if it persists in its hostile and provocative practices against the DPRK despite the latter’s repeated protest and warning, it can be regarded as a declaration of war against the DPRK,” Kwon said, using the initials of North Korea’s formal name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. 

            In face of the North’s growing threats, South Korea has been seeking stronger reassurances from the United States that it would swiftly and decisively use its nuclear capabilities to defend its ally from a North Korean nuclear attack.

            “The United States will continue to work with (South Korea) to ensure an effective mix of capabilities, concepts, deployments, exercises, and tailored options to deter and, if necessary, respond to coercion and aggression by (North Korea),” the Department of Defense said in a statement. 

            Meanwhile, Seoul's Unification Ministry said it will resume radiation exposure tests for North Korean escapees who had lived near the North’s northern nuclear testing ground since its first detonation in 2006. Previous tests conducted on 40 escapees found nine people with abnormalities that could indicate high exposure, though no direct link to radiation was established. 

            The Seoul-based Transitional Justice Working Group had urged South Korea to resume such tests, saying radiation may have spread by rainfall and groundwater. The U.S. and South Korean officials have said the North Korea is likely preparing to conduct its seventh test at the site in Punggye-ri, which would be the first since 2017. 

            Lee, the ministry's spokesperson, said the government plans to provide tests to any of the 881 people who had lived in that North Korean region after 2006 who wish to be tested.SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea said Friday it test-fired long-range cruise missiles off its eastern coast a day earlier, adding to a provocative streak in weapons demonstrations as its rivals step up military training.The launches, which were later confirmed by South Korea’s military, were intended to verify the reliability of the missiles and the rapid-response capabilities of the unit that operates those weapons, North Korean state media said.The launches took place as the U.S. and South Korea held a simulation in Washington aimed at sharpening their response to North Korean nuclear threats.Pyongyang’s official Korean Central News Agency said the four missiles flew for nearly three hours after being launched from the northeastern coast, drew oval and figure-eight patterns above the sea, and showed they can hit targets 2,000 kilometers (1,240 miles) away.South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said the flight details announced by North Korea had discrepancies with the readings by U.S. and South Korean intelligence assets, but it didn’t elaborate.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819932,"NHL-leading Bruins acquire Orlov, Hathaway from Capitals","BOSTON (AP) — The NHL’s best team just got bigger and tougher.

            Already on their way to one of the best seasons in hockey history, the Boston Bruins acquired defenseman Dmitry Orlov and forward Garnet Hathaway from the Washington Capitals on Thursday in exchange for forward Craig Smith and three draft choices. It’s the latest big acquisition by an Eastern Conference contender as the league approaches the March 3 trade deadline.

            “Let’s hope we stay healthy and try to take a run, play our best hockey at the right time,” Bruins general manager Don Sweeney said in a call with reporters. “It's going to be a hard path. It's a hard path to get in. It's even harder once you are in.” 











            Boston sent a 2023 first-round pick, a 2024 second-rounder, a 2025 third-rounder and Smith to Washington. The Capitals retained half of Orlov’s salary and Minnesota will pay 25%; the Wild will receive a 2023 fifth-rounder for helping Boston stay under the cap.

            Sweeney said Orlov and Garnet were arranging travel so they can join the Bruins on on their four-game trip, which began Thursday night against Seattle. They will join the team with the NHL's best record after leaving one that won it all in 2018 but hasn't gotten out of the first round since and is struggling to get into postseason position this season. 

            “They've been a ridiculously competitive and successful part of the (Capitals) organization,” Sweeney said. “So (they're) a little bit shocked. But once they hear the excitement in our voice in bringing them on board, it quickly shifts.” 

            With a 43-8-5 record and 91 points heading into the Kraken game — a pace that would surpass the 1976-77 Montreal Canadiens' all-time record of 132 points — the Bruins have shown few weaknesses. But the memories of recent playoff disappointments left Sweeney worried about depth, especially on defense, heading into what he hopes will be a long postseason run.

            The Capitals are selling at the trade deadline for the first time since Alex Ovechkin’s rookie year more than a decade and a half ago.

            “This trade allows us to acquire draft capital, infuse youth and restock our system,” general manager Brian MacLellan said. “While this season has proven challenging with injuries to our significant players, we are in a position to use some of our current assets to retool our club and build a competitive team moving forward.”

            The Bruins have topped 100 points for four straight non-pandemic seasons but have made just one long playoff run, losing to the St. Louis Blues in the 2019 Stanley Cup Final. After falling in the first round last year, Sweeney fired coach Bruce Cassidy and replaced him with Jim Montgomery.

            Despite starting the year without top scorer Brad Marchand and top defenseman Charlie McAvoy, who were both recovering from offseason surgery, the Bruins zoomed to the top of the NHL standings. They won 17 of their first 19 games and did not lose in regulation at home until Jan. 12.

            “Our roster is battle-tested,” Sweeney said. ""I think we can play any type of game against any type of team and we're able to react accordingly or dictate accordingly. We were trying to complement and add to that.”

            Orlov, 31, was a homegrown player for Washington and helped the team win the Stanley Cup in 2018. Hathaway, 31, has played on the Capitals’ fourth line for the past four seasons.

            “Dmitry has been with our organization for almost 14 years and was a key contributor in helping us win the Stanley Cup,” MacLellan said. “Garnet has been an important part of our team and a role model off the ice for his contributions to our community. We wish both players all the best with Boston.”

            Orlov was officially traded from Washington to Minnesota and then on to Boston, with the Wild sending 2017 pick Andrei Svetlakov to the Bruins. Sweeney said he didn't have any indication that Svetlakov, who’s playing in the KHL, would be leaving Russia.

            AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsBOSTON (AP) — The NHL’s best team just got bigger and tougher.Already on their way to one of the best seasons in hockey history, the Boston Bruins acquired defenseman Dmitry Orlov and forward Garnet Hathaway from the Washington Capitals on Thursday in exchange for forward Craig Smith and three draft choices. It’s the latest big acquisition by an Eastern Conference contender as the league approaches the March 3 trade deadline.“Let’s hope we stay healthy and try to take a run, play our best hockey at the right time,” Bruins general manager Don Sweeney said in a call with reporters. “It's going to be a hard path. It's a hard path to get in. It's even harder once you are in.”Boston sent a 2023 first-round pick, a 2024 second-rounder, a 2025 third-rounder and Smith to Washington. The Capitals retained half of Orlov’s salary and Minnesota will pay 25%; the Wild will receive a 2023 fifth-rounder for helping Boston stay under the cap.Sweeney said Orlov and Garnet were arranging travel so they can join the Bruins on on their four-game trip, which began Thursday night against Seattle. They will join the team with the NHL's best record after leaving one that won it all in 2018 but hasn't gotten out of the first round since and is struggling to get into postseason position this season.“They've been a ridiculously competitive and successful part of the (Capitals) organization,” Sweeney said. “So (they're) a little bit shocked. But once they hear the excitement in our voice in bringing them on board, it quickly shifts.”With a 43-8-5 record and 91 points heading into the Kraken game — a pace that would surpass the 1976-77 Montreal Canadiens' all-time record of 132 points — the Bruins have shown few weaknesses. But the memories of recent playoff disappointments left Sweeney worried about depth, especially on defense, heading into what he hopes will be a long postseason run.The Capitals are selling at the trade deadline for the first time since Alex Ovechkin’s rookie year more than a decade and a half ago.“This trade allows us to acquire draft capital, infuse youth and restock our system,” general manager Brian MacLellan said. “While this season has proven challenging with injuries to our significant players, we are in a position to use some of our current assets to retool our club and build a competitive team moving forward.”The Bruins have topped 100 points for four straight non-pandemic seasons but have made just one long playoff run, losing to the St. Louis Blues in the 2019 Stanley Cup Final. After falling in the first round last year, Sweeney fired coach Bruce Cassidy and replaced him with Jim Montgomery.Despite starting the year without top scorer Brad Marchand and top defenseman Charlie McAvoy, who were both recovering from offseason surgery, the Bruins zoomed to the top of the NHL standings. They won 17 of their first 19 games and did not lose in regulation at home until Jan. 12.“Our roster is battle-tested,” Sweeney said. ""I think we can play any type of game against any type of team and we're able to react accordingly or dictate accordingly. We were trying to complement and add to that.”Orlov, 31, was a homegrown player for Washington and helped the team win the Stanley Cup in 2018. Hathaway, 31, has played on the Capitals’ fourth line for the past four seasons.“Dmitry has been with our organization for almost 14 years and was a key contributor in helping us win the Stanley Cup,” MacLellan said. “Garnet has been an important part of our team and a role model off the ice for his contributions to our community. We wish both players all the best with Boston.”Orlov was officially traded from Washington to Minnesota and then on to Boston, with the Wild sending 2017 pick Andrei Svetlakov to the Bruins. Sweeney said he didn't have any indication that Svetlakov, who’s playing in the KHL, would be leaving Russia.Minnesota gets a draft pick for helping facilitate a trade for the second time in less than a week. The Wild got a 2025 fourth-round pick from Toronto for retaining salary in the deal that sent Ryan O’Reilly and ex-Bruins forward Noel Acciari from St. Louis to the Maple Leafs.___Whyno reported from Washington.___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/02/24,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819934,Teen charged in rape case of LSU student later killed by car,"BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) — A teenager has been charged as an adult in the case of Madison Brooks, a Louisiana State University student who was allegedly raped then left on the side of a road where she was struck and killed by a car. 

            A grand jury indicted Desmond Carter, 17, Wednesday on charges of first-degree rape and third-degree rape. The Associated Press does not normally name juveniles accused of a crime but is identifying Carter because he has been formally charged as an adult.

            First-degree rape is the gravest sexual assault charge available to prosecutors under Louisiana law. If found guilty, the charge carries a punishment of life in prison without parole. In addition, the grand jury also weighed whether to charge Carter with second-degree kidnapping but chose not to indict him.











            The Associated Press reached out Thursday to the East Baton Rouge public defender’s office, which is representing Carter, but did not receive an immediate response.

            The charges stem from Jan. 15, when Brooks, a 19-year-old LSU student, met Carter at a bar in the Tigerland entertainment district in Baton Rouge. Police say Brooks asked Carter for a ride home and left with him and three other men. 

            Deputies allege that while in the car, the group stopped on the side of the road, where Carter and Kaivon Washington, 18, raped Brooks in the back of the vehicle. During the assault, Everett Lee, 28, and Casen Carver, 18, remained in the car, police say.

            Soon after, the group dropped Brooks off near a sub-division and drove away. Less than an hour later, around 3 a.m., Brooks — who was standing on the dark street — was struck by a ride-share vehicle. She died at a hospital. The driver — who police say was not impaired, contacted emergency personnel and remained at the crash scene — was not charged. 

            The Associated Press does not normally name rape victims, but the attorney representing Brooks' family, Kerry Miller, has publicly identified her.

            In addition to Carter's charges, Washington was charged with third-degree rape. Under Louisiana law, the charge generally involves a victim who is “incapable of resisting or of understanding the nature of the act by reason of a stupor or abnormal condition of mind produced by an intoxicating agent or any cause and the offender knew or should have known of the victim’s incapacity.” 

            Lee and Carver were both charged with principle to third-degree rape, meaning they were present but did not take part in the alleged crime.

            Similar to Carter, the three defendants could face heightened charges, but that will be left up to the grand jury, District Attorney Hillar Moore told The Advocate.BATON ROUGE, La.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819951,Vote to rid Nev. constitution of slavery moves to '24 ballot,"CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) — Nevada voters will decide whether to get rid of slavery and involuntary servitude as a form of criminal punishment from the state constitution on the 2024 ballot, part of a growing push among some states to scrub outdated, century-old language that has stayed on the books.

            The Nevada Senate unanimously passed the joint resolution on Thursday after the assembly took similar steps last week. The proposed amendment first passed the Nevada Legislature in 2021, though ballot measures must survive two consecutive sessions before going to a vote of the people.

            “I don’t know that we have fully accepted this very painful past,” said Democratic Sen. Pat Spearman of North Las Vegas, who co-sponsored the resolution. “And what you don’t face, you can’t fix.”











            Slavery and involuntary servitude are prohibited in the Nevada constitution “otherwise than in the punishment for crimes, whereof the party shall have been duly convicted.” The 13th Amendment of the U.S. constitution has nearly identical language, spurring recent attempts by Democrats in Congress to scrub that language federally. 

            About a dozen states are pushing this year to get rid of slavery or involuntary servitude exceptions in their constitutions, according to the Abolish Slavery National Network. Some advocates said this has major legal implications today, particularly in litigation related to prison labor pay and conditions.

            That language in more than a dozen state constitutions is one of the lasting legacies of chattel slavery in the United States, and the loophole gave way to other racist measures post-Civil War. This included “black codes” laws passed in the decade after the Civil War, which targeted Black people for benign interactions such as talking too loudly or not yielding on the sidewalk. Those targeted would end up in custody for these minor actions and often be forced into low or unpaid work.

            Also, in some southern states, convict leasing was essentially a new form of slavery that started during the Reconstruction Era and went on for decades. States and companies made money from arresting mostly Black men and then leasing them to private railways, mines and plantations.

            Colorado became the first state in recent years to revise its constitution in 2018 to ban slavery and involuntary servitude, followed by Utah and Nebraska in 2020.

            Last fall, voters approved measures that scrubbed the language in Alabama, Oregon, Tennessee and Vermont.

            California lawmakers are also considering putting the measure on the 2024 ballot. Last week, more than 40 supporters of the measure gathered in Sacramento, where lawmakers and formerly incarcerated people talked about the impacts of forced labor in prisons.

            It’s not uncommon for prisoners in California, Nevada and other states to be paid around $1 an hour to fight fires, clean prison cells, make license plates or do yard work at cemeteries.

            The ACLU of Nevada is considering litigation related to the pay and working conditions of incarcerated women at prison firefighting camps — and the measure could protect people from “harmful, deadly conditions without being forced to labor for our sake,” said Lilith Baran, the group’s policy manager.

            “This is not just a feel-good bill,” Baran said in an interview last week after a hearing for the resolution. “This has actual, real implications on people’s lives.”

            Democrats in Congress have not yet passed federal legislation changing the 13th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. If the latest attempt wins approval in Congress, the constitutional amendment must be ratified by three-fourths of U.S. states.

            Moments before Thursday’s vote, Democratic Sen. Dallas Harris, of Las Vegas, another co-sponsor, took note of the federal language and ongoing attempts to rectify it.

            “While we can remove this from our state constitution, it still remains in our federal constitution and I urge my colleagues in the federal government to make similar steps today.""

            She continued: ""In the immortal words of Melissa Jefferson, better known as Lizzo, ‘It’s about damn time.’”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819952,"Dropping Mardi Gras gun cases a mistake, prosecutor says","NEW ORLEANS (AP) — An assistant prosecutor wrongly decided to drop prosecution of more than a dozen illegal gun possession cases arising from Mardi Gras season arrests in exchange for the suspects' agreeing to forfeit their weapons, New Orleans District Attorney Jason Williams said Thursday.

            Williams' statement was issued about the same time New Orleans Police Superintendent Michelle Woodfork told reporters her cousin was shot to death Tuesday night outside a neighborhood bar, a victim of sporadic, deadly gun violence that marred a largely peaceful weekend of Mardi Gras celebrations. 

            Williams' office had come under sharp criticism when local news outlets reported the non-prosecution decision affecting 15 misdemeanor suspects and one felony suspect who were making their first court appearances on the weapons charges. LSU wide receiver Malik Nabers was among those arrested on misdemeanor charges, according to New Orleans news outlets.











            “The Assistant DA’s strategic decision to refuse these misdemeanors in exchange for forfeiture of the weapons at first appearance was improper and does not represent our office policy or procedure,” Williams said in a news release. His office did not identify the prosecutor and said there would be an internal investigation.

             It was not immediately clear whether authorities could choose to renew prosecution of the suspects.

            Woodfork referred all questions about the prosecution decision to Williams' office during an afternoon news conference to discuss Mardi Gras safety. She said police confiscated more than 200 guns from the French Quarter, central business district, parade routes and other parts of the city during Carnival season.

            She praised city police, state police and departments that provided law enforcement manpower from other jurisdictions in the state to help keep order during a citywide celebration that draws hundreds of thousands of locals and visitors to the streets.

            But she also noted violence that broke out in spots of the city — including gunfire that erupted among parade watchers as the popular Bacchus parade rolled Sunday night, causing a panic that sent revelers running for cover. A teenager was killed and one man has been arrested in that case.

            Less publicized was the death of a woman identified by the coroner as Nicole Williams, 50, who was shot to death Tuesday night. Woodfork confirmed at Thursday's news conference that Williams was her cousin.

            “Fifty years old,” Williams said, asking for prayers for her family. “Lost her life and she was doing absolutely nothing.” 

            Woodfork gave few details and said nothing of the suspect, another woman, arrested in the case. The shooting happened near Kermit's Treme' Mother in Law Lounge. The nightspot is off the beaten tourist path but is known among New Orleans music lovers. It's owned by trumpeter Kermit Ruffins and once belonged to rhythm and blues singer Ernie K-Doe.

            Woodfork said police faced numerous day-to-day challenges in the final weekend of Carnival season besides the usual crowd control duties. 

            She noted that even as parades rolled and revelers jammed the French Quarter, police were involved in a standoff with a man who barricaded himself in a house Tuesday morning after threatening to kill family members. At one point during the standoff that lasted past midnight, police said, the man fired at officers in an armored vehicle. There were no injures and the man was taken into custody early Wednesday.NEW ORLEANS (AP) — An assistant prosecutor wrongly decided to drop prosecution of more than a dozen illegal gun possession cases arising from Mardi Gras season arrests in exchange for the suspects' agreeing to forfeit their weapons, New Orleans District Attorney Jason Williams said Thursday.Williams' statement was issued about the same time New Orleans Police Superintendent Michelle Woodfork told reporters her cousin was shot to death Tuesday night outside a neighborhood bar, a victim of sporadic, deadly gun violence that marred a largely peaceful weekend of Mardi Gras celebrations.Williams' office had come under sharp criticism when local news outlets reported the non-prosecution decision affecting 15 misdemeanor suspects and one felony suspect who were making their first court appearances on the weapons charges.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819953,"Horschel, Bramlett lead Honda Classic with 1st-round 65s","PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. (AP) — Billy Horschel has never won a PGA Tour event in his home state of Florida. His quest to change that is off to a fine start.

            Horschel shot a 5-under 65 on Thursday, tying him with Joseph Bramlett for the first-round lead in the Honda Classic at PGA National. Bramlett had a bogey-free round; Horschel had six birdies and one bogey.

            “Just played really solid,” Horschel said. “Didn’t do anything special. Hit some quality iron shots here and there. I wouldn’t say everything was sort of automatic and it was easy. I had to just sort of work my way into making some good swings here and there. But overall, it was a really solid day of golf.”











            Horschel’s pre-Honda preparations included a trip to the doctor, finally giving in and getting a prescription after trying to fight off a sinus infection for a few days. He might have felt tired, but it didn’t show.

            The 65 was his best score in 33 rounds as a pro at PGA National. He’d shot 66 on two previous occasions.

            “Listen, there’s no secret,” said Horschel, who played his college golf at Florida. “It’s not a secret. I grind. I work hard. It’s no secret out here that I work really, really hard out here. But this week with just the way I’m feeling and everything, energy’s still not completely 100 percent every day.”

            Bramlett scrambled nicely when he had to. He missed six of 14 fairways and hit 13 of 18 greens.

            “I definitely like when the conditions are difficult and guys have to really earn it,” said Bramlett, who has never won on the PGA Tour. “I think that’s historically always been in my favor.”

            Pierceson Coody — a sponsor exemption playing his first PGA Tour event as a professional — finished the first round at 4 under, alongside Justin Suh. Coody has two wins in 15 starts on the Korn Ferry Tour since turning pro in June.

            “It really just feels like another professional event,” the grandson of 1971 Masters champion Charles Coody said. “I’ve only played (15) professional events. But other than the big grandstands it’s not that different. You’re just playing golf, you’re trying to put a good score together. No real nerves out there. Just happy to play well.”

            Suh missed a 10-foot birdie putt on his last hole — No. 9 — that would have tied him for the lead.

            DIVOTS: Play was suspended for darkness just past 6 p.m., and four groups were unable to finish. Carson Young was at 4 under with three holes left to play. ... Past Honda champion Sungjae Im, the top-ranked player in the field at No. 18, birdied the last and shot 3-under 67. ... Past Ryder Cup captain Padraig Harrington played with the 2023 Ryder Cup captains, Luke Donald of Europe and Zach Johnson of the U.S. There was a bit of Cup talk during the round. “He’s a nice resource. He loves the Cup and represented it well,” Johnson said of Harrington. Johnson shot 68, Donald 71 and Harrington 72. ... Defending champion Sepp Straka opened with a 1-under 69. ... Monday qualifier Parker Coody, Pierceson’s twin brother, shot 74.

But other than the big grandstands it’s not that different. You’re just playing golf, you’re trying to put a good score together. No real nerves out there.

(AP) — Authorities in Albuquerque discovered three people had died after an off-duty state parks law enforcement officer spotted a person lying in the street and police followed a trail of blood inside a home where two people had been shot, police said Thursday.

            The person found in the middle of the roadway appeared to have been stabbed and ultimately died, Albuquerque police spokesperson Gilbert Gallegos said.

            Inside, officers found two people with fatal gunshot wounds. Neighbors had reported hearing the sound of gunshots earlier that morning.











            No identities were released.

            Detectives talked to a man who was locked in a room at the house and don't believe he was a suspect, Gallegos said. It's unclear if the man was wounded.

            Detectives were trying to determine the relationship among the people involved. They filed search warrants for the home and the vehicles in the garage to try to determine what happened, Gallegos said.

            Investigators believe the violence was isolated to the household in Albuquerque's North Valley. The home is in a quiet neighborhood just down the road from a public library and fire station.

            “There’s a lot of moving pieces with this. They’re investigating a lot of different possibilities,” Gallegos said. “We do not think there is an offender outstanding, but this is early in the investigation, and a firearm was found on scene, so that’s why investigators believe no one is outstanding in terms of a shooter.”

            A first responder was also seen carrying a toddler on her hip as she walked away from the scene. Gallegos said authorities were trying to find relatives and did not know if the girl was in the house at the time.ALBUQUERQUE, N.M.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819955,"MLS, Apple have high expectations with launch of Season Pass","Don Garber smiled as he showed off Major League Soccer’s new state-of-the-art facility, which will host studio shows for the Apple TV Season Pass package.

            While flashy studios and graphics work to produce a wow factor, the longtime MLS commissioner knows the importance of this weekend’s season launch.

            The 10-year, $2.5 billion partnership between Apple TV and MLS kicked off on Feb. 1 with the launch of Season Pass. Starting Saturday, every match — regular season, postseason, Leagues Cup, the All-Star game, and developmental leagues — can be accessed on the Apple TV app, allowing fans to watch without local blackouts or restrictions.











            “We feel like we’re the Usain Bolt of television production. This has been a wild sprint for the last number of months, but it’s one where we’re really confident,” Garber said during an interview with The Associated Press at the league’s media seminar last month in San Jose, California.

            The MLS/Apple model abandons the traditional framework where most games are available through a national or regional network. Even though MLS had some favorable local agreements, most teams struggled for visibility when they weren’t on either Fox, FS1 or ESPN.

            It is also a novel undertaking for a sports league and a tech giant to come together to launch a direct-to-consumer product.

            “We’ve looked at sports and acknowledged that there’s never been a better time to be a sports fan, and there’s also never been a worse time to be a sports fan,” said Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of services. “We have an opportunity with this partnership to make the experience better for fans and help grow the sport and the league in the US and beyond.”

            It is an understatement to say what Apple and MLS have built in less than nine months is ambitious. Besides constructing a 6,000-square foot production facility in the Spanish Harlem area of Manhattan, 92 announcers have been hired, and production agreements have been secured with NEP Group and IMG.

            In the first season alone, over 900 matches representing over 2,000 hours of live coverage are expected to be on Season Pass.

            As much as there will be a focus on technology, MLS and Apple are also attempting to satisfy what fans want in a soccer broadcast. All matches will be carried in English, Spanish and French for matches involving Canadian clubs. The announcers and production personnel will also be at the stadiums instead of calling matches remotely.

            Fans will also have the option of accessing the home radio feed to most matches. MLS has said all of the games will be broadcast in 1080p and that there will be more camera angles than seen in the broadcasts aired locally in recent seasons.

            By taking over the production of all its matches, MLS is conducting business the way most European soccer leagues have done it for years. The most significant difference is that this reaches beyond North America. Fans in London, Paris and wherever the Apple TV app is available will be able to see the games as well.

            “We’re playing the global sport, but we’re not yet a global league,” Garber said.

            MLS and Apple are confident that the first weekend will be free of technological snafus or crashes. They have done some preseason games, including last Saturday’s Toronto FC-LA Galaxy match that could be seen on Season Pass.

            Garber though, acknowledges that there will be some growing pains at the start, as is the case whenever any network or package launches.

            MLS will not only be competing for viewers but for their dollars. While soccer fans, more than any other group, have shown they are willing to see their favorite teams, they often have to subscribe to multiple streaming services.

            England’s Premier League is on NBC and Peacock, Germany’s Bundesliga and Spain’s La Liga are carried by ESPN+ and Italy’s Serie A is on Paramount+.

            MLS Season Pass will be $14.99 per month or $99 a season. Apple TV+ subscribers will be able to purchase it at $12.99 per month and $79 per season. Season-ticket holders to MLS clubs will receive subscriptions as part of their ticket benefits.

            For those who have Apple TV+ and don’t want to subscribe, all the games on opening week will be available for free. After that, Apple expects to offer six games free per week on Apple TV.

            MLS isn’t alone in mainly moving to streaming. The NWSL is in the final season of its agreement with CBS and Paramount+, while most U.S. Men’s and Women’s National Team games are being carried on HBO Max as part of an agreement with Warner Brothers Sports.

            While some might consider the move to mostly streaming as tuning out the traditional sports fan, Garber and MLS see it appealing more to its fan base. With matches mainly on Saturday and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. local time, MLS is trying to avoid fans not having a consistent viewing schedule.

            Last season, MLS had 63 different start times because it was at the mercy of national and regional broadcast windows.

            “I look at the way our fans are consuming sports today and soccer today, it is to have the best possible access that will motivate fans that will allow them to experience an MLS and our players, whether they’re current or new, in a way that will probably be more under our control than depending on somebody doing that for us,” Garber said.

            Fox Sports will have 34 regular-season games, including a record 15 on Fox.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819956,"MLB rule changes: pitch clock, larger bases and more","Major League Baseball is introducing a slate of new rules for the 2023 season. Here is a breakdown:

            PITCH CLOCK

            The pitch clock aims to speed the pace of play by eliminating down time between pitches. Players will have 30 seconds to resume play between batters. Between pitches, pitchers have 15 seconds with nobody on and 20 seconds if there is a baserunner. The pitcher must start his delivery before the clock expires. After a pitch, the clock starts again when the pitcher has the ball back, the catcher and batter are in the circle around home plate, and play is otherwise ready to resume.











            Batters must be in the box and alert to the pitcher with at least eight seconds on the clock. Batters can call time once per plate appearance, stopping the countdown.

            When a pitcher fails to throw a pitch in time, the penalty is an automatic ball. When a batter isn’t ready in time, it’s an automatic strike. 

            Clocks will be positioned behind home plate and beyond the outfield, where pitchers and hitters can easily see them.

            LIMITS ON PITCHER DISENGAGEMENTS

            Pitchers may only disengage from the pitching rubber — either to call timeout or to attempt a pickoff throw — twice per plate appearance. After a pitcher has used his two disengagements, he can still attempt a pickoff, but it better be successful. If the baserunner gets back safely, a balk is assessed and the runner advances.

            If a runner advances during a plate appearance, the limit on disengagements is reset. Mound visits, injury timeouts and offensive team timeouts are not considered disengagements.

            With a focus on disengagements, umpires may be stricter in calling balks for pitchers who don't come to a complete stop in their stretch.

            INFIELD SHIFT LIMITS

            The infield shift — putting three or more infielders on one side of second base, usually with one positioned in the outfield — has been a popular trend over the past decade, and many believe it has contributed to plummeting batting averages.

            The new rule states that all four infielders must have both feet within the outer boundary of the infield and two infielders must be on each side of second base when a pitch is delivered. MLB also mandated infield dirt have uniform dimensions in all 30 ballparks — the outfield edge must be 95 feet from the front of the pitching rubber. Players will not be allowed to sprint from one side of second base to the other after the pitch is released, and umpires will be given broad discretion to ensure players are following the spirit of the rule.

            BIGGER BASES

            New larger bases have been introduced to improve player safety and to modestly encourage more stolen-base attempts. The bases are now 18-square inches, up from 15-square inches. Home plate is now three inches closer to first and third base, while the corner bases are now 4 1/2 inches closer to second base.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819957,Jimmy Carter: White House rise depended on twists before '76,"PLAINS, Ga. (AP) — Jimmy Carter’s path to the presidency is an oft-told story, especially by aspiring presidents trying to be the next politician to defy Washington expectations.

            As a little-known Georgia governor, Carter announced in late 1974 that he’d seek the presidency. Atlanta’s largest newspaper answered with a mocking headline: “Jimmy Who?” National media mostly yawned.

            Undeterred, the peanut farmer took his family and friends to Iowa and New Hampshire, where “the Peanut Brigade” set the modern standard for a retail campaign and helped elect Carter as the 39th president.











            But the long odds weren’t just about 1976 for Carter, who is 98 and now receiving end-of-life care at his home in Plains, Georgia. Carter’s early life and career were replete with dominoes that could have blocked his White House road before he knew he was on it.

            Here are some “What Ifs?” that, had they played out differently, may have made it impossible for Americans ever to answer that mocking question from Atlanta newspaper editors.

            THE ARCHERY FARM 

            Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, now 95, were born in Plains. But Carter’s parents, Lillian and Earl Carter, moved their family in 1927 to a farm in the mostly Black community of Archery, just outside Plains. Thus began Carter’s exposure to divisions of race and class in the segregated, Depression-era South. 

            Young Jimmy had Black playmates with whom he hunted, fished and fashioned homemade toys. Like their neighbors, the Carters had “no running water, electricity or insulation” and depended on open fireplaces for heat. “We relieved ourselves in slop jars during the night,” Carter wrote in a memoir.

            Yet despite the lack of luxury, the future president was still secure in relative privilege, because he was the child of the white, land-owning family at the center of a community where many impoverished Black residents worked for his parents. 

            One of his earliest influencers was “Miss Rachel” Clark, a Black neighbor and caregiver who was married to the unofficial foreman of the Carter farm. Carter, who spent considerable time at the Clarks' home, would later say he “knew Rachel Clark in many ways better than my mother.”

            Those experiences — seeing the humanity of his Black friends but still living under the white supremacist order of the era — undergirded his public life as a Southern Democrat. He learned early how to navigate an evolving country and party that was stacked with segregationists in Carter's formative political years before coming to embrace civil rights. Carter did not fight for civil rights legislation in the 1950s and 1960s. He campaigned carefully for Georgia governor in 1970, avoiding explicit mentions of race. He won with a small-town, rural coalition of Black voters and white conservatives – then used it to govern more progressively on race than he had campaigned. It was a political tightrope he may never have managed if he’d grown up in the heart of Plains rather than Archery. 

            ‘MR. EARL’

            Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter married in 1946 and left Plains to launch his promising career with the U.S. Navy – with no notions of returning except as visitors. But Carter’s father, who had become a prominent merchant and state lawmaker, died in 1953. Carter made the decision, without consulting Rosalynn, to move the young family back home, where the pair built the family farm operations into an impressive peanut agribusiness. Carter joined the local school board and within a decade would run for the Georgia Assembly, further replicating his father’s path. If “Mr. Earl” had lived longer, his namesake might have become an admiral in some far-flung naval post, but never commander in chief.

            ELECTION FRAUD

            Carter sought elected office for the first time in 1962, “somewhat quixotically,” he recalled. His Democratic opponent in the state Senate primary was a peanut buyer named Homer Moore. But, the real barrier was Joe Hurst, a neighboring county’s political boss. On Election Day, Carter and his allies caught Hurst pressuring voters and discarding ballots cast for Carter. Quitman County results showed Moore with more votes than registration rolls recorded altogether. Carter challenged the results with the party. After court tussles, Carter ended up on the general election ballot and prevailed. It took a subsequent Senate floor dispute before he was finally sworn in.

            THE 1966 CHOICE

            Carter wasn’t much for the legislature’s back-slapping ways. By 1966, he decided to run for Congress against a heavyweight incumbent, Bo Callaway. Then Ernest Vandiver, a former Georgia governor, dropped out of the governor’s race, allowing Callaway to step into his place against arch-segregationist Lester Maddox. With Callaway’s switch, Carter was on his way to Washington. But the young state senator was bothered by Georgians having to choose between Callaway and Maddox. (In this era, the Democratic nominee was virtually assured a November victory.) Carter tried to recruit a moderate Democrat to run against them but was unsuccessful. So, he recalled, “I decided to relinquish my assured seat in the U.S. Congress and run for governor.” 

            He lost to Maddox. But the decision was the start of a four-year campaign that resulted in his 1970 gubernatorial win.

            NO GRAND PLANS

            History often reveals happenstance in the lives of every president. Carter even chose “Turning Point” as the title of his book about the 1962 state Senate election that changed his career trajectory. Lyndon Baines Johnson won a disputed early congressional race. Bill Clinton lost his first reelection bid as a young Arkansas governor and required a rehabilitation follow-up victory before he reached the national stage a decade later in 1992. George W. Bush narrowly won the Texas governor’s race in 1994, the same night his brother Jeb lost the Florida governor’s race as a favorite. The Texan would be president six years later. Floridian Jeb, once thought of as the political darling in that generation of the Bush dynasty, likely will never be. 

            Yet the Bushes were a blue-blooded political family already anchored in the national establishment. Johnson and Clinton had no political birthrights but set out from young ages to reach the nation’s highest office. As a young congressman, Johnson even dubbed himself “LBJ,” patterned after Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s moniker, “FDR.” 

            For Carter, ambition was a driving force generally. But it was not singularly focused.

            Carter would serve just one term. His struggles to corral inflation, ease energy shortages and quickly free American hostages in Iran overshadowed achievements at home and abroad. He signed notable legislation on the environment, education and mental health care, and started deregulation of key industries, including airlines. Abroad, he struck a peace deal between Egypt and Israel, normalized relations with China and negotiated treaties turning over control of the Panama Canal. 

            Carter would say later that he never focused on winning a second term — to his political peril — just as he had no grand design to win his first.

            Those four years in the White House “were the pinnacle of my political life,” he recalled around his 90th birthday, but “there was never an orderly or planned path to get there during my early life.”PLAINS, Ga.

He learned early how to navigate an evolving country and party that was stacked with segregationists in Carter's formative political years before coming to embrace civil rights. Carter did not fight for civil rights legislation in the 1950s and 1960s. He campaigned carefully for Georgia governor in 1970, avoiding explicit mentions of race. He won with a small-town, rural coalition of Black voters and white conservatives – then used it to govern more progressively on race than he had campaigned. It was a political tightrope he may never have managed if he’d grown up in the heart of Plains rather than Archery.‘MR. EARL’Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter married in 1946 and left Plains to launch his promising career with the U.S. Navy – with no notions of returning except as visitors. But Carter’s father, who had become a prominent merchant and state lawmaker, died in 1953. Carter made the decision, without consulting Rosalynn, to move the young family back home, where the pair built the family farm operations into an impressive peanut agribusiness. Carter joined the local school board and within a decade would run for the Georgia Assembly, further replicating his father’s path. If “Mr. Earl” had lived longer, his namesake might have become an admiral in some far-flung naval post, but never commander in chief.ELECTION FRAUDCarter sought elected office for the first time in 1962, “somewhat quixotically,” he recalled. His Democratic opponent in the state Senate primary was a peanut buyer named Homer Moore. But, the real barrier was Joe Hurst, a neighboring county’s political boss. On Election Day, Carter and his allies caught Hurst pressuring voters and discarding ballots cast for Carter. Quitman County results showed Moore with more votes than registration rolls recorded altogether. Carter challenged the results with the party. After court tussles, Carter ended up on the general election ballot and prevailed. It took a subsequent Senate floor dispute before he was finally sworn in.THE 1966 CHOICECarter wasn’t much for the legislature’s back-slapping ways. By 1966, he decided to run for Congress against a heavyweight incumbent, Bo Callaway. Then Ernest Vandiver, a former Georgia governor, dropped out of the governor’s race, allowing Callaway to step into his place against arch-segregationist Lester Maddox. With Callaway’s switch, Carter was on his way to Washington. But the young state senator was bothered by Georgians having to choose between Callaway and Maddox. (In this era, the Democratic nominee was virtually assured a November victory.) Carter tried to recruit a moderate Democrat to run against them but was unsuccessful. So, he recalled, “I decided to relinquish my assured seat in the U.S. Congress and run for governor.”He lost to Maddox. But the decision was the start of a four-year campaign that resulted in his 1970 gubernatorial win.NO GRAND PLANSHistory often reveals happenstance in the lives of every president. Carter even chose “Turning Point” as the title of his book about the 1962 state Senate election that changed his career trajectory. Lyndon Baines Johnson won a disputed early congressional race. Bill Clinton lost his first reelection bid as a young Arkansas governor and required a rehabilitation follow-up victory before he reached the national stage a decade later in 1992. George W. Bush narrowly won the Texas governor’s race in 1994, the same night his brother Jeb lost the Florida governor’s race as a favorite. The Texan would be president six years later. Floridian Jeb, once thought of as the political darling in that generation of the Bush dynasty, likely will never be.Yet the Bushes were a blue-blooded political family already anchored in the national establishment. Johnson and Clinton had no political birthrights but set out from young ages to reach the nation’s highest office. As a young congressman, Johnson even dubbed himself “LBJ,” patterned after Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s moniker, “FDR.”For Carter, ambition was a driving force generally. But it was not singularly focused.Carter would serve just one term. His struggles to corral inflation, ease energy shortages and quickly free American hostages in Iran overshadowed achievements at home and abroad. He signed notable legislation on the environment, education and mental health care, and started deregulation of key industries, including airlines. Abroad, he struck a peace deal between Egypt and Israel, normalized relations with China and negotiated treaties turning over control of the Panama Canal.Carter would say later that he never focused on winning a second term — to his political peril — just as he had no grand design to win his first.Those four years in the White House “were the pinnacle of my political life,” he recalled around his 90th birthday, but “there was never an orderly or planned path to get there during my early life.”",2023/02/24,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819959,Boeing stops deliveries of jet on questions surrounding part,"Boeing has again stopped deliveries of its 787 passenger jet because of questions around a supplier’s analysis of a part near the front of the plane, company and federal officials said Thursday.

            Boeing said the issue does not raise an immediate safety issue for planes already in service. The Federal Aviation Administration was more cautious, saying it is working with Boeing to determine what fixes might be needed for planes recently delivered to airlines.

            The discovery is the latest setback involving the two-aisle plane, which Boeing calls the Dreamliner and is mostly used on international routes. Deliveries were stopped for more than a year, until August 2022, while Boeing fixed production flaws including the fit of panels on the carbon-composite skin.











            “Boeing temporarily halted deliveries of 787 Dreamliners after notifying the FAA that it is conducting additional analysis on a fuselage component,” the FAA said in a statement Thursday. “Deliveries will not resume until the FAA is satisfied that the issue has been addressed.”

            A Boeing spokesperson said the company based in Arlington, Virginia, “discovered an analysis error by our supplier related to the 787 forward pressure bulkhead,” a part that separates the nose of the plane from the pressurized cabin. Boeing did not name the supplier.

            “There is no immediate safety of flight concern for the in-service fleet,” the company said.

            Boeing said near-term deliveries will be affected but it doesn’t expect it will change the company’s forecast of deliveries for this year.Boeing has again stopped deliveries of its 787 passenger jet because of questions around a supplier’s analysis of a part near the front of the plane, company and federal officials said Thursday.Boeing said the issue does not raise an immediate safety issue for planes already in service.

A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court  no later than March 22, 2023. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.   WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition.

Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.    DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose, among other things, that: (1) the Janssen Collaboration Agreement was less sustainable than Fate had represented to investors; (2) accordingly, certain of the clinical programs, milestone payments, and royalty payments associated with the Janssen Collaboration Agreement could not be relied upon as future revenue sources; (3) as a result, Fate had overstated the impact of the Janssen Collaboration Agreement's on Fate's long-term clinical and commercial profitability; and (4) as a result, the Company's public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. When the truth emerged, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819970,Russia launches rescue ship to space station after leaks,"Russia launched a rescue ship on Friday for two cosmonauts and a NASA astronaut whose original ride home sprang a dangerous leak while parked at the International Space Station.

            The new, empty Soyuz capsule should arrive at the orbiting lab on Sunday.

            The capsule leak in December was blamed on a micrometeorite that punctured an external radiator, draining it of coolant. The same thing appeared to happen again earlier this month, this time on a docked Russian cargo ship. Camera views showed a small hole in each spacecraft.











            The Russian Space Agency delayed the launch of the replacement Soyuz, looking for any manufacturing defects. No issues were found, and the agency proceeded with Friday's predawn launch from Kazakhstan of the capsule with bundles of supplies strapped into the three seats. 

            Given the urgent need for this capsule, two top NASA officials traveled from the U.S. to observe the launch in person. To everyone's relief, the capsule safely reached orbit nine minutes after liftoff — “a perfect ride to orbit,” NASA Mission Control's Rob Navias reported from Houston.

            
                Officials had determined it was too risky to bring NASA’s Frank Rubio and Russia’s Sergey Prokopyev and Dmitri Petelin back in their damaged Soyuz next month as originally planned. With no coolant, the cabin temperature would spike during the trip back to Earth, potentially damaging computers and other equipment, and exposing the suited-up crew to excessive heat.

            Until the new Soyuz pulls up, emergency plans call for Rubio to switch to a SpaceX crew capsule that’s docked at the space station. Prokopyev and Petelin remain assigned to their damaged Soyuz in the unlikely need for a fast getaway. Having one less person on board would keep the temperature down to a hopefully manageable level, Russian engineers concluded.

            The damaged Soyuz will return to Earth with no one aboard by the end of March, so engineers can examine it.

            The three men launched in this Soyuz last September on what should have been a six-month mission. They'll now stay in space for a full year, until a new capsule is ready for their crew replacements for liftoff in September. It was their Soyuz that just launched with no one on board.

            The damaged supply ship was filled with trash and cut loose over the weekend, burning up in the atmosphere as originally planned. 

            “The Russians are continuing to take a really close look” at both spacecraft leaks, NASA's deputy space station program manager Dana Weigel told reporters earlier this week. “They're looking at everything ... to try to understand that.""

            NASA has a fresh crew of four launching atop a SpaceX rocket early Monday morning from Florida’s Kennedy Space Center. SpaceX's William Gerstenmaier said the four astronauts returning to Earth in a few weeks already have inspected the Dragon capsule that will carry them home and “it all checked out fine.""

            Jones scored 13 of her 23 points over the two overtime periods and the third-ranked Cardinal held off No. 21 Colorado 73-62 on Thursday night.











            Jones also had 11 rebounds and seven assists for the Cardinal (27-3, 15-2 Pac-12), who remain on top of the conference standings with one game left on their regular season schedule. Stanford was picked to win the Pac-12 in the preseason poll.

            Lauren Betts, who grew up in Colorado, sent the game into double overtime by hitting one of two free throws with 3.8 seconds remaining. She finished with 14 points.

            Jones took control in overtime No. 2, helping the Cardinal outscore Colorado by a 13-2 margin. It was the first double OT game for Stanford since 2017.

            “Feels great. A ‘W’ is a ‘W' in my opinion, even though we have lots of things to work on,” Jones said. “We learned a lot, but it also proves that we're very gritty and a tough team.”

            Jaylyn Sherrod led Colorado (21-7, 12-5) with 19 points, including the game-tying basket with just under 30 seconds remaining in regulation. She briefly left the game in the fourth after appearing to turn her ankle. The Buffaloes, who trailed by as many as eight in the fourth, were missing their third-leading scorer, Frida Formann, due to an illness. 

            “What anyone who watched this game saw on full display wasn’t a bunch of superstars. It was a team that’s tough, and gritty, and fights and scraps for every single possession. That’s who we are,” said Colorado coach JR Payne, whose team shot 28.8% from the floor. “It really hurts to lose a game like this to Stanford, but incredibly proud of how we played.” 

            The usually sure-shooting Cardinal missed their opening 15 shots and trailed by as many as 14 points in the first half. They entered on short rest after beating UCLA on Monday.

            The games between the Buffaloes and Cardinal are typically back-and-forth. Entering Thursday, six of the last last 10 were decided by single digits, including two that went into overtime. This was another thriller.

            “We kind of made it exciting for TV,” Cardinal coach Tara VanDerveer said. “That’s a tournament team. Colorado has had a great season. ... We can both get better because of a game like this.”

            Cameron Brink fouled out in overtime after scoring eight points. Her string of reaching double figures ended at 21 straight games. 

            Stanford didn't score its first basket of the game until Brooke Demetre hit a 3-pointer with 12 seconds remaining in the opening quarter. But Colorado could only open up a 13-5 advantage. 

            Missed opportunity?

            “They’re really hard to score against because they’re so big at every position,” Payne said. “So that makes it challenging.” 

            BIG PICTURE

            Stanford: Since losing to No. 1 South Carolina in OT on Nov. 20, the Cardinal have now won 10 straight over ranked teams. 

            Colorado: The Buffaloes remain on three wins over ranked teams this season. The last time they knocked off four in the same season was 2001-02.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819981,Ramos ends international career after call from Spain coach,"MADRID (AP) — Spain veteran Sergio Ramos ended his international career on Thursday after being told by the new coach of the national team that Ramos was no longer in his plans.

            In his farewell, Ramos criticized coach Luis de la Fuente for deciding not to pick him regardless of his future performances.

            The Paris Saint-Germain central defender said he wished he could have played more for the national team and that his time with “La Roja” would have ended in a better way.











            “I think this trajectory deserved to end either through a personal decision or because my performance was not worthy of the national team anymore, not because of age or other reasons,” the 36-year-old Ramos said.

            The former Real Madrid star said he “admired” and was “jealous” of veterans like Lionel Messi, Luka Modric and Pepe, who are still thriving with their national teams.

            Ramos had already been left out of the national team by former coach Luis Enrique, and did not make it to Spain's World Cup squad in Qatar last year.

            Ramos helped Spain win the European Championships in 2008 and 2012, and the World Cup in 2010.

            Of the 37 People’s Liberation Army (PLA) aircraft, 12 were tracked in Taiwan’s air defense identification zone (ADIZ), according to the MND. Four Shenyang J-16 fighter jets, two Shenyang J-11 jet fighters, and two Chengdu J-10 fighter planes crossed the Taiwan Strait median line, while one TB-001 reconnaissance drone crossed the median line and also flew along the southwest and southeast corner of Taiwan’s ADIZ.

            Meanwhile, one Shaanxi Y-8 anti-submarine warfare plane and one BZK-005 reconnaissance drone entered the southwest corner of Taiwan’s identification zone.

            In response, Taiwan sent aircraft, naval ships, and used land-based missiles to monitor the PLA aircraft and vessels.











            So far this month, Beijing has sent 288 military aircraft and 100 naval ships around Taiwan. Since September 2020, China has increased its use of gray zone tactics by routinely sending aircraft into Taiwan’s ADIZ.

            Gray zone tactics are defined as “an effort or series of efforts beyond steady-state deterrence and assurance that attempts to achieve one’s security objectives without resort to direct and sizable use of force.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820010,Utah projected as No. 1 seed in women's NCAA Tournament,"Utah would join South Carolina, Indiana and Stanford as No. 1 seeds in the NCAA Tournament if it began now.

            The NCAA women’s basketball selection committee did its second and final reveal Thursday of the teams in line for the top 16 seeds before selection Sunday. South Carolina, Indiana and Stanford were also listed as top seeds in the earlier reveal.

            “That was the easiest part of the day. I am really looking forward to seeing those teams play towards the end of the season,” selection committee chair Lisa Peterson said in a phone interview. “Indiana and Iowa, Stanford and Utah play this weekend.”











            None of Thursday night’s games were factored in, including No. 3 Stanford's double-overtime win over No. 21 Colorado. This is the final weekend of the regular season for most major conferences.

            The Utes — ranked eighth in the AP Top 25 — moved up to the one-line, replacing UConn, which was beaten by St. John's on Tuesday night. Utah faces Stanford on Saturday to close out its regular season. The Huskies fell to a No. 2 seed, seventh overall.

            Peterson said the biggest debate was about who the fourth No. 1 should be — Utah or LSU.

            “That was probably the biggest topic of conversation,” she said. “You have more information when you’re looking at these teams. One thing that stuck out was the number of top 25 and 50 wins when you compare LSU to Utah. It was a difficult choice for sure. One thing we couldn’t get past was (LSU's) strength of the schedule.”

            The top 16 seeds will host first- and second-round games with the regional rounds being played at two neutral sites for the first time instead of the traditional four. Seattle will host half of the Sweet 16 and Greenville, South Carolina, will host the other eight teams.

            South Carolina and Indiana were projected as the top seeds in the Greenville Regional with Stanford and Utah in Seattle. The unbeaten Gamecocks were the overall No. 1 seed.

            Joining the Gamecocks in their projected bracket were No. 2 Virginia Tech, No. 3 Iowa and No. 4 Michigan. The Hoosiers would have No. 2 UConn, No. 3 Notre Dame and No. 4 Arizona.

            The other top teams in Stanford’s region were No. 2 Maryland, No. 3 Duke and No. 4 Villanova. Utah would be joined by LSU, Ohio State and Texas.

            Arizona was the only team not included in the original reveal that entered the second one. The Wildcats replaced North Carolina.

            Teams just outside the top 16 included the Tar Heels, Tennessee, Colorado, Oklahoma and UCLA.

            The Big Ten had five teams in the top 16 while the Atlantic Coast Conference and Pac-12 each had three. The Southeastern Conference and Big East had two and the Big 12 had one.

            The Final Four will be played in Dallas on March 31 and the NCAA championship game is two days later. Dallas is also hosting the Division II and III championship games on April 1.

            Selection Sunday is March 12.

            The NCAA has been doing in-season reveals for women's basketball since 2015 to give teams an early idea of where they could end up in the bracket.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820011,Alcaraz drops set but recovers to beat Fognini at Rio Open,"RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Defending champion Carlos Alcaraz was far from his best against veteran Fabio Fognini but managed to advance to the Rio Open quarterfinals on Thursday.

            The top-seeded Alcaraz overcame the 35-year-old Italian 6-7 (5), 6-2, 6-4 in 2 hours, 47 minutes. The U.S. Open champion's next opponent will be Dusan Lajovic, who beat his Serbian compatriot Laslo Djere 6-2, 6-4.

            The 19-year-old Alcaraz is playing his second tournament since he was sidelined for four months due to a right leg injury. 











            The Spaniard won the Argentina Open title last Sunday having dropped only one set in the tournament. 

            In Rio, though, Alcaraz has been far less dominant against both rivals he has faced — No. 556 Mateus Alves, who Alcaraz beat 6-4, 6-4, and No. 86 Fognini.

            “It was a match of ups and downs,” Alcaraz said of his win over Fognini. “In this kind of match against players like him you cannot miss the opportunities.”

            Alcaraz took a 3-0 lead over Fognini in the first set, but a run of unforced errors allowed the Italian to fight back and win in the tiebreaker.

            In the third set, Alcaraz once again had a 3-0 advantage but saw the Italian recover and stage a comeback, but the teenager's energy and strong forehands prevailed.

            “I struggled with my serve a little bit. I was up with a lot of control of the match. But a lot of breaks of serve in a row,” Alcaraz said. “I was going to have my chances to improve the game on my serve and I think I did.”

            Earlier, Bernabe Zapata Miralles eliminated fourth-seeded Francisco Cerundolo 6-1, 4-6, 6-1. His quarterfinal will be against fellow Spaniard Albert Ramos-Vinolas, who beat Daniel Elahi Galan 6-2, 6-4.

            Sebastian Baez will take on Nicolas Jarry in the next round. Baez beat Juan Pablo Varillas 7-5, 7-6 (6), while Jarry defeated Pedro Martinez 6-2, 6-2.

            AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsRIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Defending champion Carlos Alcaraz was far from his best against veteran Fabio Fognini but managed to advance to the Rio Open quarterfinals on Thursday.The top-seeded Alcaraz overcame the 35-year-old Italian 6-7 (5), 6-2, 6-4 in 2 hours, 47 minutes. The U.S. Open champion's next opponent will be Dusan Lajovic, who beat his Serbian compatriot Laslo Djere 6-2, 6-4.The 19-year-old Alcaraz is playing his second tournament since he was sidelined for four months due to a right leg injury.The Spaniard won the Argentina Open title last Sunday having dropped only one set in the tournament.In Rio, though, Alcaraz has been far less dominant against both rivals he has faced — No. 556 Mateus Alves, who Alcaraz beat 6-4, 6-4, and No. 86 Fognini.“It was a match of ups and downs,” Alcaraz said of his win over Fognini. “In this kind of match against players like him you cannot miss the opportunities.”Alcaraz took a 3-0 lead over Fognini in the first set, but a run of unforced errors allowed the Italian to fight back and win in the tiebreaker.In the third set, Alcaraz once again had a 3-0 advantage but saw the Italian recover and stage a comeback, but the teenager's energy and strong forehands prevailed.“I struggled with my serve a little bit. I was up with a lot of control of the match. But a lot of breaks of serve in a row,” Alcaraz said. “I was going to have my chances to improve the game on my serve and I think I did.”Earlier, Bernabe Zapata Miralles eliminated fourth-seeded Francisco Cerundolo 6-1, 4-6, 6-1. His quarterfinal will be against fellow Spaniard Albert Ramos-Vinolas, who beat Daniel Elahi Galan 6-2, 6-4.Sebastian Baez will take on Nicolas Jarry in the next round. Baez beat Juan Pablo Varillas 7-5, 7-6 (6), while Jarry defeated Pedro Martinez 6-2, 6-2.The fourth quarterfinal will be between Cameron Norrie and Hugo Dellien.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820012,No plans to attempt recovery of Washington avalanche victims,"LEAVENWORTH, Wash. (AP) — There are still no plans to attempt a recovery of three climbers killed in an avalanche on Washington state’s Colchuck Peak last weekend because conditions remain too dangerous, authorities said Thursday.

            Two avalanche experts tried to reach the scene on Wednesday, but failed to make it all the way due to the risk of further slides, according to the Chelan County Sheriff’s Office. At least 20 inches of snow had fallen in the area in the last couple days, further complicating any recovery efforts, they said.

            It was too cloudy Thursday for the sheriff's office to send a helicopter to survey the site, said sheriff’s Sgt. Jason Reinfeld.











            The victims were Seong Cho, a 54-year-old male Korean citizen from West Hartford, Connecticut; Jeannie Lee, a 60-year-old woman from Bayside, New York; and Yun Park, a 66-year-old man from Palisades Park, New Jersey. They were members of a climbing club based in New York, the sheriff's office said.

            They were killed Sunday as they ascended a steep, snow-packed gulley on the 8,705-foot (2,653-meter) Colchuck Peak, about 70 miles (115 kilometers) east of Seattle. A fourth member of their party was also caught up in the slide, but suffered only minor injuries and was able to verify that the three had died before additional avalanches covered the bodies.

            The avalanche was the the deadliest in the U.S. since four backcountry skiers were killed in an avalanche in Utah two years ago.LEAVENWORTH, Wash.

(AP) — The former police chief for the city of Oakland who was fired last week over the alleged cover-up of an officer’s misconduct filed an appeal to what he says was his wrongful termination. 

            LeRonne Armstrong's attorney Will Edelman on Wednesday sent a letter to the city, officially beginning the process to challenge Mayor Sheng Thao's decision to fire Armstrong, Sam Singer, a spokesman for the former chief said in a statement.

            Singer said the appeals process would be handled by the city, which will have to assign a hearing officer to review the case and make a recommendation about whether to uphold Armstrong’s firing. 











            
                Thao fired Armstrong on Feb. 15, saying a probe concluded Armstrong and the department failed to properly investigate and discipline a sergeant who was involved in a hit-and-run with his patrol car and, in a separate incident, fired his service weapon inside an elevator at police headquarters.

            Thao first placed Armstrong on paid administrate leave in January to review investigations by the department’s federal monitor that found the police chief responsible for gross dereliction of duty in the sergeant's misconduct cases.

            Armstrong argued the findings are without merit and publicly demanded his job back. He has the support of some leaders in the Bay Area city that has seen a spike in crime and homicides in the last three years. 

            However, some community groups that have called for police reform in the city of 400,000 people applauded Thao's decision. 

            George Galvis, founder and executive director of Communities United for Restorative Youth Justice, said Armstrong's firing was a first step “in holding OPD accountable for years of abuse and scandals.”

Maddy Westbeld scored 11 points, while KK Bransford had 10 points on 5-of-7 shooting off the bench for Notre Dame, which closed out its regular-season home slate with a 13-2 record.

            “I love that style of play,” Notre Dame coach Niele Ivey said. “It shows the balance that we have. You can’t lock in on one person on our team, and I think that makes us dangerous.”











            Georgia Tech (13-15, 4-13 ACC) has lost five of its last six contests. Guard Cameron Swartz led the Yellow Jackets with 10 points.

            “This is a tough place to play, and Notre Dame is a good basketball team,” coach Nell Fortner said. “We’re young. We’re trying to learn, and we’re trying to get to a better place with our talent.”

            TURNING POINT

            Georgia Tech hit its first four shots and jumped out to an 8-0 lead in the first quarter, forcing Ivey to burn an early timeout.

            Notre Dame responded with a 17-4 run by shooting 67% from the field to close out the period with a five-point advantage.

            “Sometimes it’s like that with the emotion of senior night,"" Ivey said. “They came out on fire, and we adjust, so I’m just happy we adjusted early and turned the table.”

            The Yellow Jackets kept it to a single-digit deficit in the second quarter before the Irish blew the game open after outscoring Georgia Tech by 10 points in the third quarter.

            STAT OF THE NIGHT

            Notre Dame turned the ball over nine times on Thursday. The Irish last had single-digit turnovers in an 85-65 win over Arizona St. on Nov. 26.

            ""I’m proud of that stat,"" Ivey said. “It’s something we’re working on, so it looks like it’s paying off.”

            Georgia Tech: is coming off back-to-back NCAA Tournament appearances, but the Yellow Jackets are in danger of finishing below .500 for the first time since the 2012-13 season.

            Notre Dame: picks up its 14th ACC victory and remains in a first-place tie with No. 11 Duke atop the ACC.

            “I talked to them about just controlling our own destiny,” Ivey said, who's in her third season as Notre Dame's head coach. “We’re in a different position than we were my first year and my second year. We’ve done a great job to put ourselves in (this) position.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820016,Trend Micro Acquires SOC Technology Expert Anlyz,"Technology tuck-in enhances industry’s broadest XDR security platform

HONG KONG SAR -  Media OutReach - 24 February 2023 -  Trend Micro (TYO: 4704; TSE: 4704), a global cybersecurity leader, has announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire Anlyz, a leading provider of security operations center (SOC) technology. The acquisition will extend Trend's orchestration, automation and integration capabilities and will enable enterprises and Managed Security Service Providers (MSSPs) to improve operational efficiencies, cost effectiveness and security outcomes.   The deal encompasses intellectual property, industry expertise and more than 40 technical employees all focused on bolstering Trend's security platform strategy. With this acquisition, the company will expand its engineering team of over 3000, adding a new research & development center in Bangalore, India.   Managed Security Service Providers (MSSPs) will be empowered to grow their strategic SOC services while minimizing the complexity of the underlying security stack by reducing the number of technology vendors needed. Trend's enterprise customers will benefit from a comprehensive extended detection and response (XDR) and incident response orchestration platform that can maximize analyst productivity and help relieve resource constraints.   Gartner research stated, ""As buyers, both end customers and service providers, continue to consolidate vendors/providers, buyers will seek best-of-suite and integrated solutions over best-of- breed point solutions. Preferred technology vendors will be those that ease integration with other IT and security technology and tools within the environment, supporting efforts toward use-case-based outcomes.""[1]   ""We are happy to welcome the Anlyz team into the Trend family – together we are increasing SOC effectiveness and reducing both the technology and resources burdens,"" said Kevin Simzer, Chief Operating Officer at Trend Micro. ""Due to market pressure, we see organizations moving past security point-solution experiments in preference for platform breadth that allows for vendor consolidation, maximized return on investments and efficiencies.""   Trend Micro and Anlyz have been technology alliance partners since 2021 and share more than 30 joint customers that are positioned to move forward quickly to capitalize on the opportunities ahead.   Eventus TechSol is one of the many MSSPs powering joint customers delivering measurable ""XDR Powered SOC"" improvements for clients. ""We have reduced the mean-time-to-detect and mean-time-to-respond ratio, down from weeks to hours for incidents,"" said Jay Thakker, Practice Head at the company. ""We use playbooks for log enrichment and automated response as well as threat intelligence and threat hunting capabilities provided by the platform to proactively hunt for known and behavioral attacks.""   Anlyz has primarily focused on security orchestration and case management delivering powerful SOAR capabilities for MSSPs to manage the incident response process across multiple clients. It also offers intelligent log aggregation enabling data ingestion and enrichment across a range of data sources and security solutions, using a high performance, scalable architecture. Trend will leverage Anlyz's SOAR solution and rich set of product connectors to broaden its platform and enable additional integration and automation options across customers' IT ecosystems.   Trend's MSSP channel customers will benefit from:         An anchor technology platform to manage the SOC function for their clients         A reduced requirement to architect individual custom solutions for their customers, thanks to an integrated core stack and multi-tenant view out of the box         Visibility, analysis, and automation across Trend, third-party products, and customer instances, making it easier to manage XDR across multiple customers         A scalable, flexible, and feature-rich platform to appeal to all types of customers no matter the size and complexity of their IT environment      [1] Gartner®, Emerging Trends: Future of Security Services, Shawn Eftink, John Collins, November 2021 GARTNER is a registered trademark and service mark of Gartner, Inc. and/or its affiliates in the U.S. and internationally and is used herein with permission.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820021,US to boost troops up to 200 in Taiwan amid China menace,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The U.S. is reportedly set to increase the number of troops in Taiwan amid increasingly aggressive military posturing by China.The Wall Street Journal on Thursday (Feb. 23) cited U.S. officials as saying that 100 to 200 soldiers will be dispatched to Taiwan in the coming months. Approximately 39 troops and Department of Defense personnel are reportedly stationed in Taiwan as of September 22, 2022, according to the latest DMDC report.Over the years, the number of U.S. troops in Taiwan has fluctuated, but generally only numbered around a dozen or two. For example, in the last report released during the Obama administration on Dec. 31, 2016, the U.S. had a total troop presence of 10, while under Trump, the number of soldiers from various branches of the military was 20.Raising the number of soldiers to triple digits would represent the largest U.S. troop presence in Taiwan in decades. The troops will reportedly be sent to expand training for Taiwanese soldiers.The newspaper added that the Michigan National Guard is also providing training to a Taiwanese military unit. This will reportedly include the participation of Taiwanese forces in annual war games involving multiple countries at northern Michigan's Camp Grayling.When asked to comment on the increased number of U.S. soldiers in Taiwan, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Thursday referred the media to the Department of Defense. However, she added that in terms of U.S. policy toward Taiwan, ""Our support for and defense relationship with Taiwan remains aligned against the current threat posed by the People’s Republic of China and consistent with our One China policy. That has not changed.""After a meeting with a Congressional delegation at the presidential office on Tuesday (Feb. 21), President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) said ""Taiwan and the United States continue to bolster military exchanges."" The next day, news broke that troops from the Army will go to the U.S. for exchanges at the battalion level (500 soldiers) for the first time in history in the second half of this year.When asked by the media for comment, Taiwan’s Defense Minister Chiu Kuo-cheng (邱國正) said that the news was reported by U.S. media, but he did not know their sources. Chiu said Taiwan and the U.S. have a lot of exchanges, not limited to a single aspect, such as requesting training on U.S. weapons and equipment.Regarding the expansion of the U.S. troop presence in Taiwan, Chiu said that more information needs to be gathered to provide a thorough explanation.",2023/02/24,2984,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820037,Saudi Arabia challenges magistrate ruling on LIV subpoenas,"Saudi Arabia is disputing a federal magistrate’s ruling that its sovereign wealth fund and the fund’s governor be required to provide documents and testimony in LIV Golf’s antitrust lawsuit against the PGA Tour.

            Attorneys for the kingdom filed a letter on Thursday challenging the reasons a magistrate judge cited for allowing subpoenas of the Public Investment Fund and its governor, Yasir al-Rumayyan.

            The letter was sent to U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman, who is overseeing the case in the Northern District of California.











            U.S. Magistrate Judge Susan van Keulen in a Feb. 16 decision said the PIF and al-Rumayyan are not protected by the Foreign Sovereign Immunity Act because of a commercial activity exception.

            The dispute centers around LIV’s argument that the PIF and al-Rumayyan provided broad oversight of the rival league. The PGA Tour says documents obtained during discovery indicate they were actively involved in signing players to LIV Golf.

            According to court documents, the PIF owns 93% of LIV Golf, which in the last year has paid signing fees reported to be upward of $100 million to players, including Phil Mickelson, Dustin Johnson, Brooks Koepka and Bryson DeChambeau.

            The letter also says van Keulen suggested the PIF would have waived its immunity if it authorized LIV Golf to sue the PGA Tour.

            The PGA Tour banned players who joined LIV Golf from competing in its events, and nine players — including Mickelson and DeChambeau — filed an antitrust lawsuit on Aug. 3. LIV Golf soon joined as a plaintiff, and only three players — DeChambeau, Peter Uihlein and Matt Jones — remain as plaintiffs.

            “Her reasoning has broad implications for Saudi Arabia beyond the instant case,” said the letter, filed by the Washington law firm of Kellogg, Hansen, Todd, Figel & Frederick.

            The letter said while van Keulen’s ruling held that al-Rumayyan — a minister in Saudi Arabia’s government — met the requirements for common-law foreign official immunity, that law has a commercial-activity exception to immunity.

            “Recognition of such an exception to common-law foreign official immunity likewise has wide-ranging implications for Saudi Arabia,” the letter said.

            The PIF and al-Rumayyan contend that enforcing subpoenas in the U.S. would force them to violate Saudi law against disclosure of confidential information.

            The letter said Saudi Arabia planned to file a friend-of-court brief that would include interpretations of the commercial activity exception to the Foreign Sovereign Immunity Act and enforcement of Saudi Arabia law.

            Freeman, meanwhile, ruled the PGA Tour could add the PIF and al-Rumayyan as defendants in its countersuit.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820039,China issues peace plan; Zelenskyy says he'll await details,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — China called for a cease-fire and peace talks between Ukraine and Russia on Friday, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy cautiously welcomed Beijing’s involvement -- but said success would depend on actions not words.

            Beijing claims to have a neutral stance in the war that began one year ago, but has also said it has a “no limits friendship” with Russia and has refused to criticize Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, or even refer to it as an invasion. It has accused the West of provoking the conflict and “fanning the flames” by providing Ukraine with defensive arms.

            “I believe that the fact that China started talking about Ukraine is not bad,” Zelenskyy told a news conference Friday. “But the question is what follows the words. The question is in the steps and where they will lead to.”











            The plan released by China’s Foreign Ministry mainly reiterated long-held positions, and analysts said Beijing would be an unlikely broker.

            But some observers warned that Ukraine and its allies need to tread carefully, saying that rejection of what China sees as its peace overture could move Beijing closer toward providing arms to Russia instead.

            Volodymyr Fesenko, head of the Kyiv-based Penta Center independent think tank, believes that Zelenskyy ""will try to play with China... in order not to allow China and Russia to come closer together.”

            “As long as China comes up with peacemaker initiatives, it will be forced to maintain neutrality and to abstain from supplying weapons and direct military assistance to Russia,” Fesenko told The Associated Press.

            Ukraine also might see ""a scenario in which China is at least pressuring Russia to contain the use of nuclear weapons and create a mechanism to control nuclear power plants in Ukraine,” he said.

            For Beijing's part, it needed to clarify its stance, whether or not Kyiv and Moscow pay much heed, said Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Beijing’s Renmin University.

            “China feels it necessary to repeat its self-perceived neutrality at this juncture, to save some international influence by not only criticizing NATO but also distinguishing itself from Russia’s behavior,” Shi said.

            China's proposal calls for the territorial integrity of all countries to be respected, but does not say what will happen to the regions Russia has occupied since the invasion. It also calls for an end to “unilateral” sanctions on Russia, indirectly criticizes the expansion of the NATO alliance, and condemns threats of nuclear force.

            The proposal is “an attempt for public relations on the part of China,” said Li Mingjiang, a professor and international security expert at Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University. “I’m not convinced that this policy is going to improve their credibility in being an honest broker.” 

            Russia’s Foreign Ministry welcomed the proposal and said it shares China's ideas, including the rejection of Western sanctions. At the same time, ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova reaffirmed Moscow's demand for Ukraine to acknowledge Russia's land gains, renounce its bid to join NATO and assume a neutral status, among other conditions for peace.

            Ukraine has said it will not agree to any peace without the return of all its territory.

            Zelenskyy's adviser Mykhailo Podolyak tweeted that any peace plan that envisages only a ceasefire and allows Russia to continue occupying any part of Ukraine “isn’t about peace, but about freezing the war, Ukraine's defeat, next stages of Russian genocide.”

            Ukraine's allies also expressed skepticism. U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said on CNN that his first reaction to the proposal was that “it could stop at point one, which is: Respect the sovereignty of all nations.”

            He added: “This war could end tomorrow if Russia stopped attacking Ukraine and withdrew its forces.... This was a war of choice.”

            German government spokesman Wolfgang Buchner said the Chinese proposal contained several important points, but was missing a key one: “first and foremost the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine.”

            China abstained Thursday when the U.N. General Assembly approved a nonbinding resolution that calls for Russia to end hostilities in Ukraine and withdraw its forces. 

            Its 12-point peace proposal also urges measures to prevent attacks on civilians, keep nuclear facilities safe, establish humanitarian corridors and ensure the export of grain. It called for an end to the “Cold War mentality” — China’s standard term for what it regards as U.S. hegemony and maintenance of alliances such as NATO.

            “Dialogue and negotiation are the only viable solution to the Ukraine crisis.” the proposal said. It offered no details on what form talks should take but said “China will continue to play a constructive role in this regard.”

            Zelenskyy said Friday that his main goal was making sure China doesn’t supply weapons to Russia. And he expressed hope that China’s involvement could be useful in isolating Russia. “Our task is to gather everyone to isolate the one,” he said.

            He also said he’d like to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping: “I believe that it will benefit our countries and the security of the world.”

            China's proposal comes as U.S.-China relations have hit a historic low over Taiwan, disputes over trade and technology, human rights, and China’s aggressive actions in the South China Sea.

            The U.S. recently said China may be preparing to provide Russia with military aid, an allegation that Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin called “nothing more than slander and smears.” 

            On Friday he referred to a “massive disinformation in this respect against China.”

            Wang was responding to a report in the German magazine Der Spiegel that Russia’s military was negotiating with a small Chinese drone manufacturer for the “components and know-how” to allow the country to manufacture about 100 suicide drones a month.

The stolen data included details of the company’s business operations and the accounts and passwords of 900,000 customers whose transaction activities were exposed, UDN reported.The department store confirmed the hack, saying it was recently blackmailed by anonymous senders. It stressed, however, that there was a discrepancy between the data leaked and what was stored in the company’s database, suggesting there could be other institutions being hacked, according to CNA.The company has reacted by temporarily halting its loyalty program and asking for a change of password for its registered customers, the report said.A joint probe was launched by the ministries of digital affairs and economic affairs on Thursday (Feb. 23), said Digital Minister Audrey Tang (唐鳳). The incident has revived the talk about the need for better and coordinated supervision of data breach events, as some are governed by Cyber Security Management Act (資通安全管理法) and others by Personal Data Protection Act (個人資料保護法).The two regulations appear to be overlapping in some aspects and the fact that the penalties stipulated by the Personal Data Protection Act are more lenient has drawn criticism. A maximum fine of NT$200,000 (US$6,565) is incurred for companies failing to protect the information of their clients.The act should be amended, Tang urged, while an overhaul should be conducted for competent authorities to enhance the management of data associated with citizens.",2023/02/24,1843,Society

            Her “Crossroads Foundation” said Thursday the cancer was stage 3 and the 71-year-old Australian will begin a treatment of chemotherapy and radiation in the next two weeks.

            “It means so much to me for all my friends and family to lend so much support,” Stephenson said in a statement. “I have had some negative challenges in my career and managed to survive. This is just another tough hole that is ‘uphill and against the wind.’ See you on my next downhill and downwind hole!”











            Stephenson was among the first to bring sex appeal to women’s golf, part of that the design of former LPGA Tour Commissioner Ray Volpe. Stephenson’s most famous moment outside the ropes was posing in a bathtub, her body covered only by golf balls.

            She backed up her celebrity by winning 16 times on the LPGA Tour, including three majors. She was lacking only the Kraft Nabisco Championship to complete the career Grand Slam.

            She was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 2019 and also received the Order of Australia Medal.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820060,Justice Department indicts 13 alleged leaders of MS-13 gang,"NEW YORK (AP) — Federal prosecutors on Thursday announced charges against more than a dozen alleged high-ranking leaders of the international gang MS-13, accusing them of directing criminal activities including murder in the United States, El Salvador, Mexico and other countries over the past two decades. 

            An indictment unsealed by the U.S. Department of Justice in the Eastern District of New York details charges against 13 defendants including racketeering conspiracy, conspiracy to provide or conceal material support to terrorists and narco-terrorism conspiracy. 

            Four of the alleged gang leaders were expelled from Mexico and arrested by the FBI at George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston on Wednesday, according to a Justice Department statement. They face additional charges including alien smuggling conspiracy resulting in death and could receive the death penalty if convicted, prosecutors said. 











            Four other co-defendants are at large, while the rest are believed to be in custody in El Salvador pending possible extradition, the statement said. 

            The 13 defendants are part of MS-13’s command structure and play significant leadership roles in the organization’s international operations, according to the court filing. 

            Prosecutors said they authorized and directed violence including multiple murders in the United States, Mexico and elsewhere as part of an effort to expand MS-13’s influence and territorial control. 

            In El Salvador the alleged gang leaders operated military-style training camps for firearms and explosives, according to the indictment.

            “The defendants have actively engaged in public displays of violence to threaten and intimidate civilian populations, to obtain and control territory and to manipulate the electoral process in El Salvador,” the DOJ statement said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820061,"Zia Cooke, unbeaten No. 1 South Carolina women top Tennessee","KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Zia Cooke scored 19 points and Kierra Fletcher had 15 as No. 1 South Carolina spoiled Tennessee's pack-the-paint strategy in a 73-60 victory Thursday night.

            The Gamecocks (28-0, 15-0 Southeastern Conference) clinched at least a tie for the regular-season conference title.

            “We're blessed,” South Carolina coach Dawn Staley said. “We're a low-maintenance, high-performance team. Can't ask for more than that.”











            The Lady Volunteers (20-10, 12-3) jammed the middle, trying to limit opportunities for star Aliyah Boston and daring the Gamecocks to beat them from the perimeter. Boston finished with 11 points.

            “(Boston) is a high-level IQ basketball player,” Staley said. “She doesn't force things. She always makes the right basketball play.”

            Fletcher and Cooke combined to hit 5 of 8 3-pointers. The Gamecocks dominated the rebounding 48-34, with 20 of them on the offensive glass. Kamilla Cardoso had 15 boards and Brea Beal had 11 points and 11 rebounds. Sixteen of those offensive rebounds came in the first half.

            ""South Carolina ... is a load,” said Tennessee coach Kellie Harper. “No one's been able to crack them this year.”

            “We had some schematic issues in the first half,” she said. “We'd have people sag off (on defense) but not box out.”

            Rickea Jackson scored 21 points for Tennessee, which led 19-10 after the first quarter. Jordan Horston had 14 points and 11 rebounds and Karoline Striplin added 11 points.

            Nine straight third-quarter points, five by Fletcher, turned a close game into a double-digit difference.

            South Carolina had a 17-point run in the second quarter as it rallied from 10 down to later take a 33-29 halftime lead. Cooke scored eight straight points in that stretch.

            The Lady Vols were held scoreless for more than 6 minutes before Striplin hit a 3-pointer just before the break.

            “It takes a little bit of time,” Staley said of figuring out the Lady Vols' strategy. “It takes time to figure out where the holes are. We had to maintain our defense.”

            The Gamecocks went the final 4:44 of the first quarter without scoring as Tennessee built a nine-point lead.

            “We lost our pace in the second quarter,” Harper said. “We got some offensive rebounds and looked so excited to get them.”

            POLL IMPLICATIONS

            South Carolina: The Gamecocks have been on top of the poll for 35 weeks, while winning 33 straight games. That’s third-most all-time behind UConn (51 weeks) and Louisiana Tech (36). … Sunday’s overtime escape from Mississippi State cost South Carolina one No. 1 vote this week, keeping the Gamecocks from being a unanimous selection for the first time all season. No. 2 Indiana got the one vote.

            Tennessee: The Lady Vols have now lost to each of the top five teams in the poll. That statistic makes it easy to understand how they have to toughest schedule in the country.

            BIG PICTURE

            South Carolina: Since 1981-82, the NCAA Tournament era, only nine teams have had unbeaten seasons. UConn has done it six times and Baylor, Tennessee and Texas have done it once. … Ten of the 14 players on the Gamecocks’ roster are at least 6 feet tall.

            Tennessee: Despite having three conference losses, the Lady Vols have locked up a double-bye for the SEC Tournament. … Horston came into the game with 427 assists, two behind Kristen Clement for No. 10 all-time in the Tennessee record book. … Tennessee junior Tess Darby has been named to the SEC Community Service Team for her involvement in a service trip to Rwanda through the university.

            UP NEXT

            South Carolina: Georgia will visit South Carolina on Sunday. Earlier this year, the Gamecocks beat the Bulldogs by 17 points.

            Tennessee: The Lady Vols will close out their regular-season schedule at Kentucky on Sunday. The two teams have not met this season.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820063,"Kiser scores 34, carries No. 12 Michigan women past Rutgers","ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) — Emily Kiser scored a career-high 34 points and grabbed 10 rebounds to lead short-handed No. 12 Michigan to a 71-53 win over Rutgers on Thursday night.

            On senior night Kiser, a graduate student, was 14-of-17 shooting, draining both of her 3-pointers as well as all four free throws. That helped offset the absence of leading scorers Leigha Brown (18.2) and Laila Phelia (17.0).

            Phelia, a sophomore, missed her sixth-straight game with a lower-leg injury while Brown, a senior, missed the game for unspecified reasons. A school statement released before the game said, ""Leigha Brown will not be present or participate in tonight’s game due to an internal issue. There will be no further comment.”











            Brown scored a career-high 36 points in Michigan's last game.

            Maddie Nolan scored 15 points with three 3-pointers, seven assists and three steals for the Wolverines (21-7, 11-6 Big Ten), who had lost two straight to ranked teams but clinched the fifth-seed in the league tournament.

            Kaylene Smikle scored 14 points to lead Rutgers (11-18, 5-12) and Kai Carter added 13.

            Kiser simply wouldn't let the Wolverines, who received the No. 16 seed in the NCAA Tournament reveal during the game, lose. She had 14 points in the first quarter when they went up 20-12. Despite being outscored 14-7 in the second quarter — Kiser had four — they led 27-26. 

            Kiser took over in the third, making all seven of her shots for 14 points, including the first six points of the quarter as Michigan pushed the lead to 12.

            Rutgers scored two quick baskets in the fourth to get within eight but the Wolverines had five of their seven 3s in the quarter.

            Michigan closes the regular season at Wisconsin on Tuesday while Rutgers is home against No. 25 Illinois on Sunday. The Big Ten Conference tournament starts on Wednesday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820064,Pili leads No. 8 Utah to rout of California,"SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Alissa Pili showed right away that her injured ankle was just fine.

            Pili scored 26 points and Jenna Johnson added 21 to help No. 8 Utah beat California 101-76 on Thursday night.

            “It’s just been a lot of rehab and treatment just to get it feeling better and good enough for me to go,” Pili said.











            Returning from a sprained ankle that kept her out last game, Pili dominated her 26 minutes on the court and the Utes built enough of a lead to allow her to get some extra rest.

            “She’s a tough kid, in case you haven’t noticed,” Utah coach Lynne Roberts said.

            Pili and Johnson combined to make 19 of 28 field goals, with most of them in the paint. 

            “The thing about Alissa and Jenna both is they’re just so reliable. We never have to wonder or worry where their headspace may be,” Roberts said.

            The Utes made 27 layups as they take almost all their shots from beyond the arc or at the basket.

            “Rolling to the hoop hard and the guards finding me with little dump-off passes,” Johnson said of her success around the basket.

            The Utes (24-3, 14-3 Pac-12) went 5-for-8 from behind the 3-point line and ran at every opportunity in the second half to break open a tight game and cruise to a wire-to-wire victory and keep them undefeated at home.

            “We run at elevation every day and we have big motors. The other team always wears down before we do and when we see that, it makes us run even harder,” Johnson said.

            Jayda Curry paced the Bears (13-15, 4-13) with 28 points and Kemery Martin, a transfer from Utah, contributed 15.

            “Jayda is getting going. This is the Jada Curry that we all know,” Cal coach Charmin Smith said. “We did a good job knocking down shots early.”

            Behind Curry, a dynamic shooter who can score from anywhere, the Bears tied the Utes four times in the second quarter but never led. Issy Palmer banked in a 3-pointer at the buzzer to give Utah a 49-43 edge at halftime.

            Pili, a transfer from USC, is a physical presence who had opponents bouncing off her post moves and defense throughout the game. They even stopped play in the first quarter to check for a flagrant when a Bear collided with Pili and fell hard to the court but ruled it a common foul.

            After allowing a 9-0 run to start their last game against Arizona State, the Utes asserted themselves early this time surging to a 15-2 start behind Pili’s nine points in the first four minutes.

            Despite a roster without any seniors, the Utes are motoring through the best season in program history with a top-five offense and a consistent spot in the Top 10 since the turn of the new year.

            “It was a good, balanced team win. Now we’re 14-3? Wow, to win 14 games in this league is a big deal,” Roberts said. “So proud of this team.”

            California: The Bears are playing as well as they have all season after beating USC in their last game and their offense continued to be unstoppable at times on Thursday. The deterrent to an upset bid was their inability to stop Utah’s multi-pronged attack and committing some inopportune turnovers to start Utah fast breaks.

            Utah: After struggling on the Arizona trip with a loss to Arizona and narrow win over last-place Arizona State, the Utes looked more like themselves with Pili controlling the middle and multiple players getting to the hoop on straight-line drives and fast breaks.

            POLL IMPLICATIONS

            How far the Utes rise will depend more on how they fare Saturday’s regular-season finale against No. 3 Stanford, which holds a one-game lead over Utah in the Pac-12 standings.

            Utah: Hosts Stanford on Saturday.SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Alissa Pili showed right away that her injured ankle was just fine.Pili scored 26 points and Jenna Johnson added 21 to help No. 8 Utah beat California 101-76 on Thursday night.“It’s just been a lot of rehab and treatment just to get it feeling better and good enough for me to go,” Pili said.Returning from a sprained ankle that kept her out last game, Pili dominated her 26 minutes on the court and the Utes built enough of a lead to allow her to get some extra rest.“She’s a tough kid, in case you haven’t noticed,” Utah coach Lynne Roberts said.Pili and Johnson combined to make 19 of 28 field goals, with most of them in the paint.“The thing about Alissa and Jenna both is they’re just so reliable. We never have to wonder or worry where their headspace may be,” Roberts said.The Utes made 27 layups as they take almost all their shots from beyond the arc or at the basket.“Rolling to the hoop hard and the guards finding me with little dump-off passes,” Johnson said of her success around the basket.The Utes (24-3, 14-3 Pac-12) went 5-for-8 from behind the 3-point line and ran at every opportunity in the second half to break open a tight game and cruise to a wire-to-wire victory and keep them undefeated at home.“We run at elevation every day and we have big motors. The other team always wears down before we do and when we see that, it makes us run even harder,” Johnson said.Jayda Curry paced the Bears (13-15, 4-13) with 28 points and Kemery Martin, a transfer from Utah, contributed 15.“Jayda is getting going. This is the Jada Curry that we all know,” Cal coach Charmin Smith said. “We did a good job knocking down shots early.”Behind Curry, a dynamic shooter who can score from anywhere, the Bears tied the Utes four times in the second quarter but never led. Issy Palmer banked in a 3-pointer at the buzzer to give Utah a 49-43 edge at halftime.Pili, a transfer from USC, is a physical presence who had opponents bouncing off her post moves and defense throughout the game. They even stopped play in the first quarter to check for a flagrant when a Bear collided with Pili and fell hard to the court but ruled it a common foul.After allowing a 9-0 run to start their last game against Arizona State, the Utes asserted themselves early this time surging to a 15-2 start behind Pili’s nine points in the first four minutes.Despite a roster without any seniors, the Utes are motoring through the best season in program history with a top-five offense and a consistent spot in the Top 10 since the turn of the new year.“It was a good, balanced team win. Now we’re 14-3? Wow, to win 14 games in this league is a big deal,” Roberts said. “So proud of this team.”BIG PICTURECalifornia: The Bears are playing as well as they have all season after beating USC in their last game and their offense continued to be unstoppable at times on Thursday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820065,'Succession' creator says upcoming 4th season is its last,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — The creator of the hit HBO series “Succession” says the upcoming fourth season will be its last.

            Jesse Armstrong told The New Yorker in a piece posted online Thursday that he wanted the show's many fans to know the end was approaching. 

            “I quite like that idea, creatively, because then the audience is just able to enjoy everything as it comes, without trying to figure things out, or perceiving things in a certain way once they know it’s the final season,” Armstrong said.











            “Succession” follows a wealthy family that owns a major media conglomerate and struggles to maintain its power. It stars Brian Cox as the Roy family patriarch and Jeremy Strong as one of his children, who connive to succeed their father as the company's leader. 

            HBO confirmed that the fourth season set to premiere next month will be its last. 

            The show has won 13 Emmy Awards so far, including several for Armstrong for writing and drama series honors in 2020 and 2022.

            “I’ve never thought this could go on forever. The end has always been kind of present in my mind,” Armstrong told the New Yorker. “From Season 2, I’ve been trying to think: Is it the next one, or the one after that, or is it the one after that?”

            Armstrong may not leave all the characters behind. While he said ending the show now will result in a “meaty” resolution, he is also open to revisiting some of the characters in another project.

            “When I’ve talked to some of my collaborators, like: Maybe there’s another part of this world we could come back to, if there was an appetite? Maybe there’s something else that could be done, that harnessed what’s been good about the way we’ve worked on this,” Armstrong said.LOS ANGELES (AP) — The creator of the hit HBO series “Succession” says the upcoming fourth season will be its last.Jesse Armstrong told The New Yorker in a piece posted online Thursday that he wanted the show's many fans to know the end was approaching.“I quite like that idea, creatively, because then the audience is just able to enjoy everything as it comes, without trying to figure things out, or perceiving things in a certain way once they know it’s the final season,” Armstrong said.“Succession” follows a wealthy family that owns a major media conglomerate and struggles to maintain its power.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820095,US says war with Taiwan is not China's 'internal matter',"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — On the eve of the first anniversary of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday (Feb. 23) said that the reason why the world is so worried about a crisis in the Taiwan Strait is because it is not China's ""internal matter,"" but concerns the whole world and a Chinese invasion of Taiwan would have catastrophic consequences for the global economy.Blinken was invited to attend an online event hosted by The Atlantic and spoke with its Editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg about the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which will reach its one-year anniversary on Friday (Feb. 24). During the interview, Goldberg asked whether Russia's ""reinvasion"" of Ukraine made it more or less likely that China would take military action against Taiwan in the near future.Blinken said the fact that many countries in Europe and beyond have understood that it ""could open a Pandora's box"" if such military aggression by Russia was permitted without consequences. He said that was why Japan and South Korea have been ""our staunchest partners in this effort from day one.""He asserted that with so many countries teaming up in response to Russia's invasion, it is something ""China factors into its own thinking about Taiwan."" He stressed that the sanctions and export controls imposed on Russia are ""doing serious damage"" and the effects will only continue to accumulate.Blinked suggested that Beijing will have to take the strong possibility of sanctions into account when considering an invasion of Taiwan. He said China will also need to weigh the ""huge reputational costs"" Russia has suffered as a result of the invasion.The secretary of state then emphasized that one important reason why the world is so focused on a potential war in the Taiwan Strait is that it is ""not an internal matter."" Rather, it is a ""matter of concern for quite literally the entire world.""He noted that 50% of commercial container traffic passes through the Taiwan Strait on a daily basis. He also highlighted that a high percentage of the semiconductors used by the world for a broad spectrum of electronic devices are manufactured in Taiwan.Blinken argued that if there was a crisis in the strait caused by Chinese military actions, it would have ""disastrous consequences for the world economy and for countries around the world."" He then concluded, ""And that's a message too that Beijing is hearing increasingly.""",2023/02/24,4139,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820097,"Wendell Carter beats buzzer with tip-in, Magic beat Pistons","ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — Wendell Carter Jr. tipped in Paolo Banchero's missed layup at the buzzer to give the Orlando Magic a 108-106 victory over the Detroit Pistons on Thursday night.

            Franz Wagner led Orlando with 21 points, and Carter controlled the boards in the fourth quarter, finishing with 14 points and 14 rebounds.

            “Tonight was his night — big-time rebounds, battling on the boards,” Magic coach Jamahl Mosley said.











            “I didn’t want to go into overtime so I had to figure out something,” said Carter, who barely avoided reaching over the rim and getting called for basket interference. It took a review to confirm the non-call. 

            Jaden Ivey led Detroit with 25 points. He hit a 3-pointer with nine seconds left to tie it, but he missed two free throws with 51 seconds left and Detroit down by three.

            “It just came down to the last possession,” said Ivey, who made 5 of 7 threes. “It could have been a different situation if I hit free throws, and I’ve just got to live with the consequences and learn from it.”

            Alec Burks added 16 points for the Pistons, who stayed in the game with 17-of-34 3-point shooting.

            Markelle Fultz had 14 points and eight assists for Orlando and Cole Anthony added 15 points off the bench.

            Ivey and Burks combined on 6 of 7 3-point shooting in the first half, but 12 Pistons turnovers led to 11 Magic points and a 47-46 Orlando lead at the break. Detroit finished the game with 21 turnovers.

            “We came out with a lot of energy, which is difficult to do after the All-Star break,” noted Pistons coach Dwayne Casey. “The timing, the rhythm, we did all that, except for the turnovers. Twenty-one (turnovers) for 21 points in a one-point game. We can’t gift them 21 points.”

            Wagner and Fultz sparked a 15-0 Magic run early in the third quarter that netted a 14-point lead, the largest of the game. But Hamidou Diallo scored six of Detroit's 14 straight points to get the Pistons right back in it.

            Two free throws by Carter put the Magic up 104-99 with 1:36 left, but a hook shot by James Wiseman with 9.5 seconds left brought the Pistons within one. After two free throws by Wagner, Ivey hit a 26-footer to tie it.

            TIP-INS

            Pistons: F Marvin Bagley III, out since Jan. 2 after having surgery on his right hand, might be activated as early as Saturday. ... The Pistons have given up 100 or more points in 34 straight games... . Burks shot 4 for 4, all 3-pointers

            The Magic are 20-15 since a 5-20 start, but still 13th in the East and hesitant to proclaim a rare playoff push.

            “We believe we can be a playoff team and do something very special this year and that’s what we’re focused on - just trying to get better every day and let the results come,” said Fultz.

            “Guys are talking about the play-in and the playoff push, and we understand that,” said Mosley. “But the most important thing is always going to be: Are we getting better? Are we improving? Are we focusing on little details, no matter the game, no matter the time of the year.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820099,"Jokic has triple-double, Nuggets beat Cavaliers 115-109","CLEVELAND (AP) — Nikola Jokic began his final push for a possible third straight MVP by getting yet another triple-double.

            This season, that means another Denver win.

            Jokic had 24 points, 18 rebounds and 13 assists for his NBA-leading 22nd triple-double and Michael Porter Jr. scored 25, leading the Nuggets to a 115-109 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers on Thursday night.











            Jokic's 13th triple-double in 16 games helped the Western Conference-leading Nuggets come out of the All-Star break with an impressive road win over the Cavs, who dropped to 25-7 at home. The Nuggets improved to 22-0 when Jokic gets a triple-double.

            “He’s the MVP,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said about his star center. ""When the MVP goes out and puts up a triple-double, it means a lot. He is a historically great player.”

            There was no argument from the Cavs.

            “I thought we had him contained until I looked up (at the scoreboard),"" Cavs star Donovan Mitchell said. “The bigs did a good but then in the second half he was the aggressor in different ways.

            ""Look at what he and (Sixers star Joel) Embiid are doing on a nightly basis. It's next level. It's impressive and I think it's going to come down to those two. Hell of a player.”

            Evan Mobley scored 31 points, but zero in the fourth quarter for Cleveland, which had its chances down the stretch. Mitchell and Darius Garland had 22 points apiece and Jarrett Allen added 14 points and 13 rebounds for the Cavs.

            Porter made two 3-pointers and Jokic dropped another as the Nuggets went on a 13-4 run to take a 114-109 lead with 2:15 left. Cleveland then missed shots on its next three possessions — Mitchell twice misfired — allowing Denver to escape with a win in a game that had playoff intensity.

            Jamal Murray returned to Denver's lineup after missing six games due to soreness in his right knee. He had 16 points and nine assists.

            Reggie Jackson, making his debut with Denver after being signed last week, ended the third quarter by making a 55-foot shot to pull the Nuggets to 91-89. Jackson was recently waived by Charlotte after being acquired from the Clippers in a trade deadline deal.

            LOVE LOST

            This was Cleveland's first game since Kevin Love accepted a contract buyout from the Cavs during the break and signed with Miami.

            Allen joked that Love's move caught him off guard.

            “I was told he was going for milk and cigarettes and he just never came back, Allen cracked before acknowledging Love's absence will hurt.

            “It was definitely sad to see him go,” he said. ""He was a great guy for the 2 1/2 years I've known him. He did a lot for this team, whether it was bringing energy, making sure we were loose. Personality-wise, we're definitely going to miss him.""

            MOST VALUBLE 

            A two-time MVP, Jokic could become the first player to win the aware three straight years since Larry Bird (1984-86). If he had a vote, Cavs coach J.B. Bickerstaff would give it to Denver's well-rounded star.

            “It’d be hard not to, to be honest with you,” he said.

            Bickerstaff noted that criteria for voting has changed.

            ""Is it the best player in the game or is it the most talented player on the best team?"" he said ""Is it the guy who’s most impactful for his team? I think there’s been a variance in how it’s been voted for. It’s hard to argue against him this year though, for sure.”

            TIP-INS

            Nuggets: While Murray came back, Denver didn't have All-Star Aaron Gordon (rib), who missed his fourth straight game and could be out a little longer. “It's not where I wish it would be,” coach Michael Malone said of Gordon's ailment. “I just hope at some point we can be whole again.”

            AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsCLEVELAND (AP) — Nikola Jokic began his final push for a possible third straight MVP by getting yet another triple-double.This season, that means another Denver win.Jokic had 24 points, 18 rebounds and 13 assists for his NBA-leading 22nd triple-double and Michael Porter Jr. scored 25, leading the Nuggets to a 115-109 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers on Thursday night.Jokic's 13th triple-double in 16 games helped the Western Conference-leading Nuggets come out of the All-Star break with an impressive road win over the Cavs, who dropped to 25-7 at home. The Nuggets improved to 22-0 when Jokic gets a triple-double.“He’s the MVP,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said about his star center. ""When the MVP goes out and puts up a triple-double, it means a lot. He is a historically great player.”There was no argument from the Cavs.“I thought we had him contained until I looked up (at the scoreboard),"" Cavs star Donovan Mitchell said. “The bigs did a good but then in the second half he was the aggressor in different ways.""Look at what he and (Sixers star Joel) Embiid are doing on a nightly basis. It's next level. It's impressive and I think it's going to come down to those two. Hell of a player.”Evan Mobley scored 31 points, but zero in the fourth quarter for Cleveland, which had its chances down the stretch. Mitchell and Darius Garland had 22 points apiece and Jarrett Allen added 14 points and 13 rebounds for the Cavs.Porter made two 3-pointers and Jokic dropped another as the Nuggets went on a 13-4 run to take a 114-109 lead with 2:15 left. Cleveland then missed shots on its next three possessions — Mitchell twice misfired — allowing Denver to escape with a win in a game that had playoff intensity.Jamal Murray returned to Denver's lineup after missing six games due to soreness in his right knee. He had 16 points and nine assists.Reggie Jackson, making his debut with Denver after being signed last week, ended the third quarter by making a 55-foot shot to pull the Nuggets to 91-89. Jackson was recently waived by Charlotte after being acquired from the Clippers in a trade deadline deal.LOVE LOSTThis was Cleveland's first game since Kevin Love accepted a contract buyout from the Cavs during the break and signed with Miami.Allen joked that Love's move caught him off guard.“I was told he was going for milk and cigarettes and he just never came back, Allen cracked before acknowledging Love's absence will hurt.“It was definitely sad to see him go,” he said. ""He was a great guy for the 2 1/2 years I've known him. He did a lot for this team, whether it was bringing energy, making sure we were loose. Personality-wise, we're definitely going to miss him.""MOST VALUBLEA two-time MVP, Jokic could become the first player to win the aware three straight years since Larry Bird (1984-86). If he had a vote, Cavs coach J.B. Bickerstaff would give it to Denver's well-rounded star.“It’d be hard not to, to be honest with you,” he said.Bickerstaff noted that criteria for voting has changed.""Is it the best player in the game or is it the most talented player on the best team?"" he said ""Is it the guy who’s most impactful for his team? I think there’s been a variance in how it’s been voted for. It’s hard to argue against him this year though, for sure.”TIP-INSNuggets: While Murray came back, Denver didn't have All-Star Aaron Gordon (rib), who missed his fourth straight game and could be out a little longer. “It's not where I wish it would be,” coach Michael Malone said of Gordon's ailment. “I just hope at some point we can be whole again.”Cavaliers: Mobley only took two shots in the fourth. ...

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820100,"Tatum has 31, breaks tie late in OT, Celtics outlast Pacers","INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Jayson Tatum scored 31 points, including the final four in the last minute of overtime, and the Boston Celtics outlasted the Indiana Pacers 142-138 Thursday night.

            Jaylen Brown added 30 points as the Celtics improved the NBA's best record to 43-17.

            “It was fun,” Brown said. “The more we are tested in those moments, I think it helps for the long run.”











            It was 138-all with 56.2 seconds left before Tatum hit a pair of free throws. He capped the scoring with a tip-in off the glass with 10.4 seconds to go.

            “I'm glad we won,” said Tatum, who had only six points at halftime. “I just tried to find ways to make plays on both ends so we could win and everybody could feel better about themselves.”

            Myles Turner tied his career high with 40 points for the Pacers. He made a career-best eight 3-pointers and Indiana shot 22 of 49 overall on 3s.

            “You can't ask for a better fight,” Turner said. “That was the No. 1 team in the league. We go toe-to-toe with them and go to overtime. We don’t want any pity, but I think we're taking a step in the right direction.”

            In a game with 17 lead changes by the end of the fourth quarter, the Pacers had the last shot in regulation, but Tyrese Haliburton's deep 3-pointer from the top of key bounced off the back rim.

            “I missed and that's on me,” Haliburton said. “I should have got us a better (shot). Put it on me.”

            Haliburton had 22 points and 14 assists. Buddy Hield, the league's 3-point leader, made four 3s and finished with 18 points. Bennedict Mathurin added 19 points off the bench.

            Malcolm Brogdon, a former Pacers point guard, scored 24 off the bench for Boston.

            “It had a playoff-like atmosphere, we had to withstand some runs, we had to adjust, we had to execute and make plays,” Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla said. “I liked the fact we had to go through that. You have to win games like that and you have to be in games like that.""

            The Pacers rallied from a 10-point halftime deficit to outscore the Celtics 39-32 in the third quarter. Turner sank three 3s in the period as the Pacers made eight beyond the arc.

            “It was just high-level basketball out there, especially in that third quarter, it was like nobody was missing,” Haliburton said.

            TIP-INS

            Celtics: Improved league-best road record to 19-10. ... Tatum is averaging a career-high 30.6 points, nearly four points above his previous season best. The sixth-year pro scored a record 55 points to earn NBA All-Star MVP honors on Sunday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820105,"McDavid scores twice, Oilers blast reeling Crosby, Pens 7-2","PITTSBURGH (AP) — The Edmonton Oilers are running out of words to describe Connor McDavid. The Pittsburgh Penguins may be running out of time to salvage their season.

            McDavid scored twice to push his total to a career-best 46 goals as the Oilers embarrassed Sidney Crosby and the Penguins 7-2 on Thursday night.

            McDavid beat Tristan Jarry from in close in the first period and then used some dazzling stickwork to deke past backup Casey DeSmith on a penalty shot late in the third period. The 26-year-old added two assists to boost his point total to an NHL-best 109.











            “I think it’s important that everybody takes a step back and understands that we’re seeing someone at the top of their craft in the prime of their career putting out there what he’s putting out,"" Oilers coach Jay Woodcroft said. ""He does it day in and day out. He’s supported by a bunch of teammates that he loves to lead and that work hard for him. It’s quite impressive.”

            Leon Draisaitl picked up 35th goal for the Oilers, who improved to 10-1-5 in their last 16 games. Ryan Nugent-Hopkins had a goal and an assist to reach 600 career points. Warren Foegele, Kailer Yamamoto and Devin Shore also scored. Stuart Skinner stopped 22 shots but was rarely tested for most of the first two periods.

            “Really consistent up and down the lineup for pretty much 60 minutes,” Shore said. “Played in their end more than we played in our end.”

            Kris Letang scored early in the first and again late in the final minutes, but the Penguins were outclassed for long stretches in between. Jarry made 23 saves before being pulled after allowing six goals in two periods in his second start since returning from an upper-body injury that forced him to sit out a month.

            “It’s frustrating right now,” Letang said after Pittsburgh's fourth straight loss. “We’re not playing the way we’re supposed to play. We get discouraged pretty quick and it’s something we shouldn’t have in this dressing room and it starts with the main guys like me, (Crosby) and (Evgeni Malkin).”

            While there are still seven weeks to go in the regular season, the franchise's run of 16 consecutive playoff berths — the longest active streak in major North American professional sports — is in jeopardy thanks to a condensed schedule, an older and top-heavy lineup and little wiggle room for general manager Ron Hextall to maneuver.

            The fans at PPG Paints Arena that arrived to watch a showdown between Crosby and McDavid were instead treated to a glimpse at the widening gap between the Penguins and the NHL's elite.

            Edmonton did whatever it wanted, whenever it wanted for most of the game in the kind of clinic Pittsburgh used to put on with regularity for the better part of two decades.

            Those days appear over. The Oilers, led by their superstar who is a heavy favorite to win his third Hart Trophy as the league's most valuable player, have the firepower that once came so easily to Crosby and the Penguins.

            McDavid set a personal best for goals in a season when he roofed a shot from in tight over a crouching Jarry 13:18 into the first. Draisaitl put the Oilers in front later in the period when he banged home a rebound on the power play.

            Edmonton was just getting started. The Oilers tacked on four goals in the second against a shaky Jarry, who is still searching for the form he showcased during the first two-plus months of the season before enduring multiple injuries.

            Pittsburgh mustered little response, mostly because the Penguins spent most of the night chasing the younger, faster Oilers. After McDavid spun Letang around to set up Nugent-Hopkins' 28th goal with 1:06 to go in the second, chants of “Fire Hextall” began as Hextall sat stoically in a coach's box just above press row.

            “I think it was a tough night for everybody and we don’t like putting on a performance like that in front of them and they pay their ticket and they want to see better, I understand that,” Crosby said. ""It wasn’t a great night for everyone.”

The Oilers, led by their superstar who is a heavy favorite to win his third Hart Trophy as the league's most valuable player, have the firepower that once came so easily to Crosby and the Penguins.McDavid set a personal best for goals in a season when he roofed a shot from in tight over a crouching Jarry 13:18 into the first. Draisaitl put the Oilers in front later in the period when he banged home a rebound on the power play.Edmonton was just getting started. The Oilers tacked on four goals in the second against a shaky Jarry, who is still searching for the form he showcased during the first two-plus months of the season before enduring multiple injuries.Pittsburgh mustered little response, mostly because the Penguins spent most of the night chasing the younger, faster Oilers. After McDavid spun Letang around to set up Nugent-Hopkins' 28th goal with 1:06 to go in the second, chants of “Fire Hextall” began as Hextall sat stoically in a coach's box just above press row.“I think it was a tough night for everybody and we don’t like putting on a performance like that in front of them and they pay their ticket and they want to see better, I understand that,” Crosby said. ""It wasn’t a great night for everyone.”UP NEXTOilers: Visit Columbus on Saturday.Penguins: Travel to St. Louis on Saturday.___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/02/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820106,Fleury gets 73rd shutout to lead Wild over Blue Jackets 2-0,"COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Marc-Andre Fleury stopped 30 shots for his 73rd career shutout and the Minnesota Wild beat the Columbus Blue Jackets 2-0 on Thursday night for their fourth straight win.

            Fleury is 12th on the NHL's career shutouts list, three behind Ed Belfour and Tony Esposito, who are tied for 10th.

            Brandon Duhaime and Kirill Kaprizov scored for Minnesota, which passed Colorado for third place in the Central Division. 











            “It was a great team effort,” Fleury said. “The guys blocked a lot of shots and let me see the puck.”

            Joonas Korpisalo stopped 23 shots for Columbus, which was shut out for the sixth time this season and third at home. The Blue Jackets have lost four of their last five home games and remain in the NHL basement. 

            “They don’t give up much,” Blue Jackets coach Brad Larsen said. “They are a big body team. They’re well coached, they’re big on the wings. They've got solid D. They’re goaltender’s good. They defend. They are a hard man-on-man (team), too, so if you’re not getting inside and you’re not beating your guys, it’s going to be a long night.”

            Despite being outshot 13-8, the first period was all Minnesota with goals from Duhaime at 3:01 and Kaprizov at 8:48 for the only scores of the game.

            “Any time you can get a lead, it really solidifies what you are doing,” Minnesota coach Dean Evason said. “Then we can really bear down and wait for our opportunities, as opposed to trying to push.” 

            BLANKED

            With his shutout, Fleury secured his first career shutout against Columbus. He has now blanked 29 of 32 NHL teams, with the exceptions being only St. Louis, Vegas and Minnesota.

            HELLO AND GOODBYE

            Johnny Gaudreau, who missed the two previous Blue Jackets games with a lower-body injury, returned to the lineup, but Cole Sillinger was scratched sick. Minnesota recalled defenseman Dakota Mermis from AHL Iowa. 

            TIME FOR A TRADE

            The Wild acquired a fifth-round selection in this year's NHL draft in a three-team trade with the Washington Capitals and Boston Bruins. Minnesota acquired defenseman Dmitry Orlov from Washington in exchange for forward Andrei Svetlakov. Minnesota then traded Orlov to Boston in exchange for a fifth-rounder. Washington retained half of Orlov’s salary and Minnesota retained 25% of his remaining salary. Minnesota also reassigned forward Adam Beckman to AHL Iowa). The Wild now have seven picks in this year's draft.

            KIRILL THE THRILL

            Kirill Kaprizov, who leads the Wild in goals (34) and points (68), has scored five goals in his last six games and registered points in 13 of his last 15 games. He is tied for eighth in the NHL for goals this season.

            SOME STREAK

            With their assists on Kaprizov's goal, Ryan Hartman and Jake Middleton extended their point streaks to three and two games, respectively.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820107,2 Pakistanis leave Guantanamo after 20 years without charges,"WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. officials returned two Pakistani brothers to their home country Thursday after holding them two decades without charges at the Guantanamo Bay military prison.

            Abdul and Mohammed Rabbani were the latest detainees to be released from U.S. custody as the U.S. moves toward emptying and shutting down the prison. The George W. Bush administration set it up at a naval base in Cuba for extremist suspects rounded up after the Sept. 11, 2001 al-Qaida attacks on the United States.

            The two brothers were originally transferred to U.S. custody after Pakistani officials arrested them in their home city of Karachi in 2002. U.S. officials accused the two of helping al-Qaida members with housing and other lower-level logistical support.











             The brothers alleged torture while in CIA custody before being transferred to Guantanamo. U.S. military records describe the two as providing little intelligence of value or recanting statements made during interrogations on the grounds they were obtained by physical abuse.

            The U.S. military announced their repatriation in a statement. It gave no immediate information on any conditions set by Pakistan regarding their return there. “The United States appreciates the willingness of the Government of Pakistan and other partners to support ongoing U.S. efforts focused on responsibly reducing the detainee population and ultimately closing the Guantanamo Bay facility,"" the Defense Department said.

            Guantanamo at its peak in 2003 held about 600 people whom the U.S. considered terrorists. Supporters of using the detention facility for such figures contend it prevented attacks. Critics say the military detention and courts subverted human rights and constitutional rights and undermined the United States’ standing abroad.

            Thirty-two detainees remain at Guantanamo Bay, including 18 eligible for transfer if stable third-party countries can be found to take them, the Pentagon said. Many are from Yemen, a country considered too plagued with war and extremist groups and too devoid of services for freed Yemeni detainees to be sent there. 

            Nine of the detainees are defendants in slow-moving military-run tribunals.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820136,Lyubushkin scores in overtime as Sabres top Lightning 6-5,"TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — Ilya Lyubushkin scored a short-handed goal 1:41 into overtime, helping Tage Thompson and the Buffalo Sabres beat the Tampa Bay Lightning 6-5 on Thursday night.

            With Thompson scoring three times in his league-leading fourth hat trick of the season, Buffalo led 5-3 early in the third period. After Tampa Bay rallied, the Sabres got the win when Lyubushkin beat Andrei Vasilevskiy on a breakaway for his first goal of the season.

            It was the first short-handed overtime goal in Sabres history.











            “I just saw a straight line and wanted to go as fast as possible,” the defenseman said after scoring his fourth goal in 253 NHL games. “I saw I had a little bit of time, not a lot, and I just tried to shoot.”

            The Sabres are in a six-team battle for the two wild-card playoff berths in the Eastern Conference. They ended a seven-game losing streak at Amalie Arena.

            “It feels nice for my team, that’s more important than me, we’re trying to push for the playoffs right now,” Lyubushkin said. “It’s important for us game by game. If you want to make the playoffs, everyone is important. The goalie made a lot of saves. Everyone made a difference.”

            Zemgus Girgensons and Jack Quinn also scored for Buffalo, and Eric Comrie made 36 saves.

            “We had to work for it,” Sabres coach Don Granato said. “We had to stay very dialed in, and focused and it was good to rise above that challenge.”

            Thompson put Buffalo ahead 2-1 in the second period by scoring on the power play, and then made it 3-1 at 12:20 when he took a pass from Jeff Skinner and beat Vasilevskiy on a breakaway. He scored his career-high 39th goal 6:18 into the third, giving the Sabres a 5-3 lead.

            “For me, when I’m skating up the ice I’m just trying to get open and find a spot,” Thompson said. “It was one of those nights where everything was coming to me.”

            But Tampa Bay made it 5-4 when Anthony Cirelli scored at 8:33, and then tied it with 5:06 remaining when Ross Colton scored a power-play goal.

            “I thought we pushed well in the third,” Cirelli said. “We battled hard and got ourselves back in the game. I thought we showed some pretty good fight to come back and tie it up, but in the end it wasn’t good enough.”

            Lightning coach Jon Cooper was happy to get a point, but he wasn’t pleased with his team’s offense-first mentality.

            “It’s the Lightning of yesteryear,” he said. “Everybody wants to go for points, and it’s all about playing offense and not about playing the other way. 

            “I’m not disappointed with the effort. It’s the mentality. I give the guys credit for coming back. It takes effort to come back like that.”

            Steven Stamkos, Victor Hedman and Brayden Point also scored for Tampa Bay. Vasilevskiy made 17 saves but his 12-game home winning streak and his personal six-game win streak against the Sabres both ended.

            The Lightning took a 1-0 lead 2:19 into the game when Stamkos beat Comrie with a wrist shot on a 2-on-1 rush. But the Sabres tied it at 11:41 on their first shot on goal; Rasmus Dahlin’s shot from the left circle hit Girgensons’ skate in the slot and slid through Vasilevskiy’s five-hole.

            ROAD WARRIOR

            Thompson leads the NHL with 22 goals in road games. He’s a big reason why the Sabres are 18-8-2 away from home.

            STREAKING

            Nikita Kucherov’s assist on Stamkos’ goal extended his home point streak to 19 games, during which he has five goals and 29 assists. He has eight points (one goal, seven assists) in three games against the Sabres this season.

It’s the mentality. I give the guys credit for coming back. It takes effort to come back like that.”Steven Stamkos, Victor Hedman and Brayden Point also scored for Tampa Bay. Vasilevskiy made 17 saves but his 12-game home winning streak and his personal six-game win streak against the Sabres both ended.The Lightning took a 1-0 lead 2:19 into the game when Stamkos beat Comrie with a wrist shot on a 2-on-1 rush. But the Sabres tied it at 11:41 on their first shot on goal; Rasmus Dahlin’s shot from the left circle hit Girgensons’ skate in the slot and slid through Vasilevskiy’s five-hole.ROAD WARRIORThompson leads the NHL with 22 goals in road games.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820137,"Caps sent to 6th straight loss by Ducks, who snap own skid","WASHINGTON (AP) — Jakob Silfverberg scored the go-ahead goal early in the third period, John Gibson made 41 saves and the Anaheim Ducks handed the reeling Washington Capitals a sixth consecutive defeat, 4-2 Thursday night.

            Isac Lundestrom, Troy Terry and Derek Grant also scored for Anaheim, which ended a six-game skid. 

            Gibson’s 21st save gave him the most through a goaltender’s first 40 games of the season since Hall of Famer Jacques Plante made 1,396 for the New York Rangers in 1963-64. 











            The Capitals are mired in their longest losing streak since losing seven in a row in 2019 and their longest stretch without a point in nearly two decades. They last lost six consecutive games all in regulation in October 2003.

            Alex Ovechkin had a few quality scoring chances, but no points in his first game back after missing the past week for the death of his father.

            COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Marc-Andre Fleury stopped 30 shots for his 73rd career shutout and Minnesota beat Columbus for its fourth straight win.

            Brandon Duhaime and Kirill Kaprizov scored for Minnesota, which passed Colorado for third place in the Central Division.

            Joonas Korpisalo stopped 23 shots for Columbus, which was shut out for the sixth time this season and third at home. The Blue Jackets have lost four of their last five home games.

            Andrew Copp, Michael Rasmussen and Filip Hronek also had goals for the Red Wings, who have surged into the playoff picture with seven wins in eight games, giving them a chance to earn a wild card and end a seven-year postseason drought.

            Vincent Trocheck pulled New York into a 1-all tie shortly before Zadina scored, but the Rangers didn’t make enough plays at both ends of the ice to slow one of the NHL’s hottest teams.

            SABRES 6, LIGHTNING 5, OT

            TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — Ilya Lyubushkin scored a short-handed goal 1:41 into overtime, helping Tage Thompson and Buffalo top Tampa.

            The win avenged Boston’s first regulation home loss of the season, which was a 3-0 defeat to Seattle on Jan. 12, still the only time Boston has been shut out this year.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820141,Kitley's jumper lifts No. 9 Hokies past No. 22 Tar Heels,"CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (AP) — Elizabeth Kitley watched the ball drop through the net, heard the horn and skipped toward midcourt to celebrate with her Virginia Tech teammates on North Carolina's home court.

            Only as they started to mob her, Kitley began backpedaling before they caught up her near a midcourt table.

            “I thought I’d go towards them but I know how passionate my teammates are and I knew they’d come to me,” Kitley said with a smile. “So I didn’t want to fall down and get hurt or anything.”











            The 6-foot-6 senior capped a night when she set Virginia Tech’s career scoring record with her jumper at the buzzer to help the ninth-ranked Hokies beat the 22nd-ranked Tar Heels 61-59 on Thursday night, extending the team's late-season streak to seven games.

            She finished with 21 points and 10 rebounds in a game played in her home state, the last coming with the Hokies (23-4, 13-4 Atlantic Coast Conference) locked in a tie game with 2.1 seconds left. Cayla King inbounded to Kitley on the right side, who had space to calmly launch about a 15-footer while UNC’s Anya Poole tried to close late.

            “That's a shot I think I'm really confident in, my teammates are confident in it for me,” Kitley said. “It felt good.”

            Officials reviewed replays to ensure no time was left before declaring it was a walk-off basket in front of a stunned-silent UNC crowd.

            “To be able to get a win like this and have a storybook ending with a winning shot but also becoming the all-time leading scorer ... that's pretty cool,” Hokies coach Kenny Brooks said.

            Kayana Traylor added 20 points for Virginia Tech, which overcame an awful shooting start and a season-high 20 turnovers.

            Deja Kelly scored 18 points to lead the Tar Heels (19-9, 10-7), including what appeared to be a go-ahead jumper with 12.2 seconds left that had the ball rattling around the rim before dropping through the net for a 58-57 lead.

            “Overall we did a decent job on (Kitley), it's a really tough kid to guard,” UNC coach Courtney Banghart said. “They great players. ... We were two points not good enough tonight.”

            BIG PICTURE

            Virginia Tech: The Hokies' six-game streak including wins against ranked Florida State and North Carolina State teams before beating then-No. 9 Duke last week to avenge their last loss. Now they're set for a double-round bye in next week's ACC Tournament.

            UNC: The Tar Heels have lost four of six, though they did get back starters Alyssa Ustby and Eva Hodgson from multi-game absences. Hodgson last played Jan. 22 before going out due to an illness and Ustby last played Feb. 2 before being out with a lower-body injury. The mission now is getting them back to full speed with one game left in the regular-season schedule. 

            “It's about game pace and they haven't played in a month or so,” Kelly said. “But they're experienced enough to get back into it soon.”

            KITLEY'S MARCH

            Kitley, the reigning ACC player of the year, needed 16 points to tie the scoring record of 1,883 points set by Aisha Sheppard just last year. She cracked that midway through the fourth quarter of a tight game, taking a feed from Georgia Amoore and hitting a jumper over Poole at the 5:18 mark to tie it at 49-all.

            CHAOTIC FINISH

            King followed Kelly's jumper by calmly hitting two free throws to put the Hokies back in front with 9.1 seconds left, while Ustby banked in a free throw to tie the game at 59-all but missed the second to set up Kitley’s jumper — a miss that Banghart said left her “heartbroken.”

            TIP-INS

            Traylor had scored 18 combined points in her last three games and hadn't hit double figures since going for a season-high 25 points at Virginia on Jan. 29. ... Ustby had nine points on 4-for-11 shooting. Hodgson had two points and went 0 for 4 in her return. ... Virginia Tech shot 56% after a 2-for-14 start. .... UNC scored 21 points off turnovers. ... Virginia Tech had a 41-28 rebounding advantage.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820144,"Red Wings boost NHL playoff push, beat Rangers 4-1","DETROIT (AP) — Filip Zadina scored the go-ahead goal midway through the second period and Ville Husso made 30 saves to help the Detroit Red Wings beat the New York Rangers 4-1 on Thursday night.

            The Red Wings have surged into the playoff picture with seven wins in eight games, giving them a chance to earn a wild card and end a seven-year postseason drought.

            “Different vibe,"" Detroit coach Derek Lalonde said. “The guys want it so bad. They’ve worked so hard to put themselves in a situation like this.""











            Vincent Trocheck pulled New York into a 1-all tie shortly before Zadina scored, but the Rangers didn't make enough plays at both ends of the ice to slow down one of the NHL's hottest teams.

            “If you’re going to win in this league, everybody has to be ready to show up,"" coach Gerard Gallant said. “We didn’t show up as a group.""

            Jaroslav Halak stopped 19 shots for the Rangers, whose spot in the playoffs seems secure as the Metropolitan's third-place team with a relatively comfortable lead over the Islanders and the rest of the division.

            The Rangers, though, have lost three straight games after winning seven in a row. They've mustered only four goals during their first three-game skid since late November — also the previous time they had lost consecutive games in regulation.

            “The way the league is, you have no time to feel bad for yourself,” Rangers forward Jimmy Vesey said. “We've got a game Saturday. Washington is always a tough team, a lot of skill, so we have to be ready to play.”

            Coming off a 4-1 road trip that made Detroit's playoff hopes realistic, Andrew Copp broke a scoreless tie late in the first period to fire up fans desperate for the franchise to be relevant again.

            “These are such hard games to play after trips like that,"" Lalonde said. “We call it a trap game. It was really important to come out of that period up a goal.""

            Trocheck quieted the crowd with his goal, but Zadina energized the arena again 1:12 later by restoring the lead in the second period.

            Michael Rasmussen put the Red Wings ahead 3-1 late in the second, and Filip Hronek took advantage of a power play early in the third period for a three-goal lead.

            “We didn’t play well enough or hard enough,” Gallant said. “When you backcheck hard, good things happen. When you backcheck lazy, the puck goes in your net and that’s what happens.”

            REMEMBER ME?

            Copp had a goal and two assists against his former team. He was acquired by the Rangers from Winnipeg last season and helped them reach the Eastern Conference finals.

            FISTICUFFS

            With 8:15 left, every skater on the ice crammed into a corner after Rasmussen checked Artemi Panarin into the boards and Adam Fox responded by hitting Rasmussen in the back.

            After the scrums subsided and just after Detroit killed off a power play, another fight broke out with New York’s Alexis Lafreniere going after Jake Walman following his clean check against Trocheck.

            “I want our guys to react the same way,"" Lalonde said. “There’s times you have to stand up for teammates, and yourself. You have to handle situations with a pack mentality. They turned two clean hits into altercations.""

            There was a moment of silence and Little Caesars Arena was dimmed with green lights before the game, honoring the three Michigan State students killed and five students hospitalized after last week's shootings on campus.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820146,"Ducks end 6-game skid, hand Capitals 6th consecutive loss","WASHINGTON (AP) — Jakob Silfverberg scored the go-ahead goal early in the third period, John Gibson made 41 saves and the Anaheim Ducks handed the reeling Washington Capitals a sixth consecutive defeat, 4-2 Thursday night.

            The Capitals are mired in their longest losing streak since losing seven in a row in 2019 and their longest stretch without a point in nearly two decades. They last lost six consecutive games all in regulation in October 2003, before the NHL had a salary cap and before Alex Ovechkin was drafted.

            This loss to the last-place Ducks, who ended their six-game skid, came in the aftermath of Washington trading two key players. Stanley Cup-winning defenseman Dmitry Orlov and gritty winger Garnet Hathaway were sent to the league-leading Boston Bruins for draft picks and depth forward Craig Smith, the start of the first trade deadline selloff by the Capitals since Ovechkin's rookie year in 2005-06.











            “We still have a chance to make the playoffs,” Ovechkin said. ""You never know what’s gonna happen. We just will continue to play. ... Nothing we can do. We players, we have to play the game and it’s not our job to make a decision.”

            The team's struggles in recent weeks contributed to general manager Brian MacLellan making the first of what could be several moves trading pending free agents such as Orlov and Hathaway. Defenseman Nick Jensen, who scored one of Washington's two goals, could be another.

            Anaheim will also be selling, but the Ducks enjoyed a moment of joy in a rough season thanks to goals by Isac Lundestrom, Troy Terry and Silfverberg, an empty-netter by Derek Grant.

            “It’s been tough sledding this year for us, I think: a lot of ups and downs,” said Ducks center Ryan Strome, who improved to 7-0 in the NHL against brother Dylan. “In such a tough season, you want to ride the highs as much as you can.""

            Strome wants Gibson to ride high after Anaheim's long-term starting goalie made some hockey history.

            Gibson's 21st save gave him the most through a goalie's first 40 games of the season since Hall of Famer Jacques Plante made 1,396 for the New York Rangers in 1963-64. Gibson, who has faced the most shots and made the most saves in the NHL this season, made 40-plus stops for a league-leading 10th time.

            ""I feel like he’s making 40 saves every night,"" Silfverberg said. “He’s been terrific for us.”

            The Capitals were booed by home fans amid several turnovers, missed defensive assignments and at least one soft goal given up by Charlie Lindgren, who faced just 20 shots in his first start since Feb. 12 — the start of this skid.

            “It’s been a really tough stretch here,"" Lindgren said. ""There’s no room for pouting. There’s no room for sulking.”

            Ovechkin in his first game back after missing the past week for the death of his father had a few quality scoring chances but no points. He and his teammates wore white and red stickers saying “Papa Ovi” on their helmets.

            “Thanks for team, thanks for organization for support,” Ovechkin said. ""It was a hard time for me, for my family and for all my friends, but it’s life and it’s gonna be a memory forever and we just have to move on.”

            Terry scored in his first game back from injury, while the Ducks played without two players who are candidates to be traded: defenseman John Klingberg and winger Adam Henrique, out with lower-body injuries.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820147,"Australia quietly expels major Russian spy ring, report says","CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — Australia has quietly expelled a large Russian spy ring whose members were posing as diplomats, a newspaper reported Friday after Australia's main security agency revealed a major counterespionage success.

            The spy ring comprised purported embassy and consular staff as well as other operatives using deep-cover identities, The Sydney Morning Herald reported, citing unnamed sources with knowledge of the operation.

            The Australian Security Intelligence Organization, the nation’s main domestic spy agency, revealed on Tuesday it had “detected and disrupted a major spy network.” ASIO has not named the country responsible.











            ASIO’s secretary-general of security Mike Burgess described the network as a “hive” of spies because it was bigger and more dangerous than a “nest” of spies previously disrupted. Precise numbers have not been reported.

            “Proxies and agents were recruited as part of a wider network. Among other malicious activities, they wanted to steal sensitive information,” Burgess said in ASIO’s annual report on threats posed to Australia.

            “It was obvious to us that the spies were highly trained because they used sophisticated tradecraft to disguise their activities,” Burgess added.

            ASIO “removed them from this country, privately and professionally,” he said.

            The Russian spies were quietly forced out of Australia over the past six months with their visas not renewed or cancelled, the newspaper reported.

            There were concerns that publicly expelling the spies could lead to retaliation against diplomats and other Australians living in Russia.

            The Russian Embassy in Australia did not respond to a request for comment on Friday.

            Prime Minister Anthony Albanese would not say whether the spy network that ASIO had disrupted was Russian.

            “I don’t comment on national security briefings, but I just say that ASIO do a very good job in defending Australia’s national interest and they have my absolute confidence and support in doing that job,” Albanese told reporters.

            Before Albanese was elected to government in May last year, he had called for Russian diplomats to be expelled from Australia in retaliation for the invasion or Ukraine.

            But Russian Ambassador Alexey Pavlovsky remains in the Australian post he has held since May 2019.

            ASIO exploited successive government decisions to allow Russian diplomats to stay by continuing its counter-espionage probe and identifying the network’s members, the newspaper reported.

            Burgess described the dismantling of the spy network as an example of his agency’s “more aggressive counter-espionage posture.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820150,"Harden, Embiid, Harris rally 76ers past Grizzlies 110-105","PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Joel Embiid slogged through illness and even played the rare role of victim on a dunk attempt. With a few big buckets and his own one-handed stuff of Ja Morant, Embiid ultimately showed why it's never good to count out The Big Man.

            Tobias Harris sank the go-ahead 3-pointer with 39 seconds left, James Harden scored 31 points, and Embiid had 27 points and 19 rebounds to help the Philadelphia 76ers storm back and beat the Memphis Grizzlies 110-105 on Thursday night.

            Embiid made 3 of 5 shots in the fourth — including the tying bucket that made it 100-all — to rally the Sixers from deficits of 17 points in the first half and 12 in the third.











            “If you took away his offense, what else did he do?” coach Doc Rivers said with a laugh.

            Try six blocks. Six assists. Oh, and 17 defensive rebounds. Go ahead, throw in 13 of 17 free throws.

            “That tells you just how great the guy is,” Rivers said.

            The 76ers shrugged off three of their worst quarters of the season to turn in a fantastic fourth that nearly shook the arena with each clutch bucket.

            “The arena was so loud, it was like playoff basketball right here,” Harris said. “We need this to prepare us, get us ready.”

            The Sixers won for the fifth time this season when trailing by 15 or more points.

            Embiid said he had to “keep being a monster” defensively when the ball wasn't dropping on offense.

            “I always think two-way is better than one-way,” Embiid said. “In those type of nights, to be able to have an impact when you don't have anything going on offensively, I think is nice.”

            Harden buried a 3 to get the run rolling and Harris sank two free throws, then made a 3 that pulled Philly within 99-98. Embiid, who finished 7 of 25 from the floor, tied it at 100-all on a jumper.

            Jaren Jackson Jr. hit a pair of tough buckets at the rim to put Memphis back ahead by four.

            Harden, though, hit one of his six 3-pointers, Harris made it 106-105 with his 3, and Embiid scooped a loose ball for a dunk that sealed the comeback. Harris finished with 20 points.

            “We've had a lot of games likes this where we get off to slow starts and have to make a comeback,” Harris said.

            The Grizzlies stumbled before the All-Star break, losing eight of nine before a 3-1 streak to end the first half. Desmond Bane scored 25 points, Jackson had 18 and Morant 15 for the Grizzlies.

            “There's going to be struggles. There's going to be adverse moments throughout the season,” Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said. “We've got to learn to get better from it. We found a way to win a couple of games going into the break, kind of on our terms.”

            Embiid had a non-COVID illness that perhaps played a role in one of his worst first halves in recent memory. He most recently played in Sunday's All-Star Game, scoring 32 points in 27 minutes.

            Whatever the reason, Embiid missed his first six shots and Sixers fans booed when he tossed up a 28-foot airball in the second quarter. He was 2 of 14 for nine points in the half. Embiid entered second in the NBA in scoring at 33.1 points on 54% shooting from the floor.

            “He's human,” Rivers said. “I think most of the shots he liked.”

            Maybe not when he drove down the lane for a thunderous one-handed dunk attempt that was soundly rejected by Jackson and led to a Memphis bucket for a 52-35 lead.

            The block encapsulated how badly Memphis had its way with the Sixers.

            “We had nothing,” Rivers said.

            Bane hit four 3s and scored 19 points in the first quarter. He had 21 at the half and the Grizzlies raced to an early 17-point lead.

            It just wasn't enough against the Harris-Embiid-Harden trio.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820152,Mercer's 2nd goal of game lifts Devils over Kings 4-3 in OT,"NEWARK, N.J. (AP) — The New Jersey Devils are having a great season, and they're doing it the hard way.

            Red-hot Dawson Mercer scored his second goal of the game 2:30 into overtime and New Jersey rallied late to beat the Los Angeles Kings 4-3 on Thursday night.

            Of the Devils' 38 wins, an NHL-high 21 have come after trailing. Seven have been in games when New Jersey was behind by multiple goals. Chicago has also won seven times when trailing by more than one.











            “I think obviously you can say we’re never out of it,” said Mercer, who has seven goals during his career-high five-game goal streak. “We've got a talented group in here, a team that plays with that speed, and we’re never out of a game. I think we can create constant pressure.”

            Tomas Tatar and Nico Hischier also scored for the Devils. Hischier netted the tying goal with 38 seconds left in regulation, and Vitek Vanecek had 19 saves.

            Anze Kopitar, Viktor Arvidsson and defenseman Sean Durzi scored for Los Angeles. Pheonix Copley made 27 saves.

            “We’ll take the one (point) we got,"" Kings coach Todd McLellan said. “There’s not a lot of teams that come into this building or play against that team that leave with points. On the other side of it, it is disappointing that we couldn’t get the last 30 seconds done.”

            Hischier tied it when he tipped Jack Hughes’ shot past Copley with the Devils’ net empty.

            Mercer tipped a pass by Dougie Hamilton past Copley for the game-winner.

            “When you’re out there with pretty good players like Dougie and Jack, and if they have the puck, I want to make sure I get myself open and Dougie found me and it went in the back of the net,” said Mercer, who has a career-high 18 goals — two more than he scored as a rookie last season.

            Durzi put the Kings ahead 3-2 with 4:19 to play in the third period. He skated in from the left point, took a pass from Kopitar and beat Vanecek for his seventh goal of the season.

            Mercer and Tatar had rallied the Devils from a two-goal deficit, setting each other up for goals late in the second period and early in the third.

            Mercer, who hit the post in the first period, tied it 2:23 into the third, taking a drop pass from Tatar and beating Copley from the right circle. 

            The Devils are 9-3 in games decided during the 3-on-3 overtime. 

            “Their speed can kill people 5-on-5,” McLellan said. ""So imagine taking two players off the ice surface. They’re extremely skilled and talented and their offensive players may not be the biggest guys, but they can slither and slide off checks and change pace and escape. That’s probably the reason why they’re winning most of those.”

            Kopitar and Arvidsson staked the Kings to a 2-0 lead in the first period.

            Kopitar opened the scoring at 7:24, beating Vanecek on a breakaway by rolling a slow shot between his legs for his 20th. The Kings' captain has goals in four straight games.

            Arvidsson got his 17th of the season a little more than four minutes later on a 2-on-1 with Kevin Fiala. Vanecek stopped Fiala's shot but Arvidsson put the rebound into an open net.

            NOTES: The Devils will celebrate the 20th anniversary of their 2003 Stanley Cup championship on Saturday before a game with Philadelphia. ... The 35-year-old Kopitar has a dozen 20-goal seasons since joining the NHL in 2006-07. ... The multiple-point game for Kopitar was his 125th on the road, tying him for third place in Kings history with Wayne Gretzky. Marcel Dionne (175) is the team's career leader. ... Kings F Adrian Kempe picked up an assist on Kopitar's goal and has a career-high seven-game point streak (eight goals, four assists).

I think we can create constant pressure.”Tomas Tatar and Nico Hischier also scored for the Devils. Hischier netted the tying goal with 38 seconds left in regulation, and Vitek Vanecek had 19 saves.Anze Kopitar, Viktor Arvidsson and defenseman Sean Durzi scored for Los Angeles. Pheonix Copley made 27 saves.“We’ll take the one (point) we got,"" Kings coach Todd McLellan said. “There’s not a lot of teams that come into this building or play against that team that leave with points. On the other side of it, it is disappointing that we couldn’t get the last 30 seconds done.”Hischier tied it when he tipped Jack Hughes’ shot past Copley with the Devils’ net empty.Mercer tipped a pass by Dougie Hamilton past Copley for the game-winner.“When you’re out there with pretty good players like Dougie and Jack, and if they have the puck, I want to make sure I get myself open and Dougie found me and it went in the back of the net,” said Mercer, who has a career-high 18 goals — two more than he scored as a rookie last season.Durzi put the Kings ahead 3-2 with 4:19 to play in the third period. He skated in from the left point, took a pass from Kopitar and beat Vanecek for his seventh goal of the season.Mercer and Tatar had rallied the Devils from a two-goal deficit, setting each other up for goals late in the second period and early in the third.Mercer, who hit the post in the first period, tied it 2:23 into the third, taking a drop pass from Tatar and beating Copley from the right circle.The Devils are 9-3 in games decided during the 3-on-3 overtime.“Their speed can kill people 5-on-5,” McLellan said. ""So imagine taking two players off the ice surface. They’re extremely skilled and talented and their offensive players may not be the biggest guys, but they can slither and slide off checks and change pace and escape. That’s probably the reason why they’re winning most of those.”Kopitar and Arvidsson staked the Kings to a 2-0 lead in the first period.Kopitar opened the scoring at 7:24, beating Vanecek on a breakaway by rolling a slow shot between his legs for his 20th. The Kings' captain has goals in four straight games.Arvidsson got his 17th of the season a little more than four minutes later on a 2-on-1 with Kevin Fiala. Vanecek stopped Fiala's shot but Arvidsson put the rebound into an open net.NOTES: The Devils will celebrate the 20th anniversary of their 2003 Stanley Cup championship on Saturday before a game with Philadelphia. ... The 35-year-old Kopitar has a dozen 20-goal seasons since joining the NHL in 2006-07. ... The multiple-point game for Kopitar was his 125th on the road, tying him for third place in Kings history with Wayne Gretzky. Marcel Dionne (175) is the team's career leader. ... Kings F Adrian Kempe picked up an assist on Kopitar's goal and has a career-high seven-game point streak (eight goals, four assists).UP NEXTKings: Play the Islanders in New York on Friday.Devils: Face the Flyers on Saturday to finish a four-game homestand.___AP NHL: www.apnews.com/hub/NHL and www.twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/02/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820153,"Poeltl has career-high 18 rebounds, Raptors beat Pelicans","TORONTO (AP) — Pascal Siakam scored 26 points, Jakob Poeltl had 21 points and a career-high 18 rebounds and the Toronto Raptors beat the New Orleans Pelicans 115-110 on Thursday night for their sixth victory in seven games.

            Gary Trent Jr. scored 18 points, including a key 3-pointer in the final minute, Scottie Barnes also had 18 and O.G. Anunoby returned from injury with 12 points as the Raptors matched their season high by winning three straight.

            Toronto won despite playing without guard Fred VanVleet, who was scratched shortly before tip off because of personal reasons.











            The Raptors have won three of four since acquiring Poeltl from San Antonio shortly before the trade deadline. Toronto couldn’t hold a 12-point lead in the final five minutes of Poeltl’s Feb. 10 debut, losing 122-116 to Utah, but the Raptors are unbeaten since.

            “First game was a little like getting thrown into the deep end,” Poeltl said, “Every game I just feel like I’m getting more and more comfortable.”

            Poeltl shot 9 for 11 against the Pelicans. He had 10 points and six rebounds in the fourth quarter, three of them on the offensive end.

            “He was huge,” Pelicans coach Willie Green said. “Down the stretch of the game, when we went and helped and contested shots, he was right there under the basket and he kind of cleaned up everything.”

            Seven of Poeltl’s 18 rebounds Thursday were offensive. Toronto outscored New Orleans 22-13 in second-chance points.

            “He gives them a true big, a guy who can finish around the basket,” Pelicans guard CJ McCollum said of Poeltl. “He sets screens, protects the rim, does a lot of the dirty work and is very efficient and effective.”

            Siakam, who was named an All-Star for the second time this season, shot 9 for 21, topping 25 points for the fifth straight game. He went 1 for 5 from 3-point range but finished 7 for 8 at the free throw line.

            Brandon Ingram scored 14 of his 36 points in the fourth and McCollum finished with 23 as the Pelicans lost for the third time in four games. New Orleans is 10-20 on the road.

            “We got off to a sluggish start, missed some easy bunnies, had some turnovers, gave up some offensive rebounds, some transition points,” McCollum said. “I think that’s what shifted the game.”

            Jonas Valanciunas had 12 points and 12 rebounds for the Pelicans, who had won the previous two meetings with Toronto.

            Ingram’s jump shot in the lane cut the deficit to three points, 111-108, with 1:13 left in the fourth quarter. Poeltl made one of two at the line before Ingram connected again with 33 seconds left, making it 112-110. Trent answered with his third 3-pointer, putting Toronto up by five points 12.3 seconds remaining.

            Up 23-19 after one, Toronto led 54-45 at halftime.

            Siakam shot 5 for 5 and scored 16 points in the third as the Raptors widened the gap, taking a 92-77 edge to the fourth.

            TIP-INS

            Pelicans: Josh Richardon scored 11 points. … G Dyson Daniels (sprained right ankle) sat for the 12th straight game. Daniels last played Jan. 24 at Denver. … F Larry Nance Jr. returned after missing the final game before the All-Star break because of a sore left groin.

            Raptors: Poeltl’s previous career high for rebounds was 17, set twice. … Anunoby returned after missing the final nine games before the All-Star break because of a sprained left wrist.

            AIR BOUCHER

            Chris Boucher punctuated the third quarter with a full court drive and one-handed slam dunk in the final seconds of the period, taking off from just inside the free throw line.

            “That was pretty cool,” Raptors coach Nick Nurse said of Boucher’s soaring slam.

            Boucher had nine points and eight rebounds.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820195,"No. 18 Gonzaga women top San Diego, clinch share of WCC","SAN DIEGO (AP) — Brynna Maxwell and Kaylynne Truong led a balanced attack with 14 points each and No. 18 Gonzaga pulled away from San Diego in the fourth quarter for a 73-61 win on Thursday night to clinch a share of the West Coast Conference title.

            Yvonne Ejim added 12 points and 11 rebounds for the Bulldogs (26-3, 16-1) and Eliza Hollingsworth scored 10.

            Gonzaga is a game ahead of Portland, which had its game at BYU postponed because of travel cancellations due to snow in Portland. No makeup has been set, but the WCC tournament doesn't start until Thursday. The Pilots play at San Diego on Saturday afternoon when Gonzaga is at BYU.











            The Bulldogs led 49-43 entering the fourth quarter and then made 10 of 17 shots, including all four of its 3-pointers. The nation's leading 3-point team at 42% went 11 of 18 behind the arc, including 2 of 2 for Maxwell, who leads the nation at 50.6% and has had a deep ball in every game this season.

            Truong's 3-pointer made it 60-45 at the 8:05 mark. Maxwell made it a 16-point game with a 3 90 seconds later. MaKayla Williams hit the last 3 to make it 73-55 before San Diego scored the last six points in the final two minutes.

            Myah Pace scored 16 points for the Toreros (16-12, 10-7), Kasey Neubert added 11 points and Kiera Oakry 10.

            San Diego shot 36%, going 3 of 14 from long range, while the Bulldogs finished at 51%.

            Gonzaga got a boost with the return of starting point guard Kayleigh Truong, a three-year starter who only got to start four games with her twin sister this season before injuring a foot. She scored six points. With Kaylynne Truong in contention for Player of the Year, they announced before senior day last Saturday they would return for another year.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820197,BOJ chief-to-be answers to lawmakers as Japan prices soar,"TOKYO (AP) — Consumer prices in Japan jumped in January by the most in more than 41 years, the government reported Friday, adding to pressure on the central bank to adjust its longstanding ultra-lax monetary policy. 

            The key price indicator, which excludes volatile fresh foods, rose 4.2% last month, though some analysts expected it to be slightly higher. Excluding energy prices, inflation rose at a 3.2% annual rate. 

            That news came as the nominee to become governor of the Bank of Japan, Kazuo Ueda, told lawmakers the central bank's current strategy was “appropriate” and that its near-zero benchmark interest rate should continue “to solidly support the economy.”











            Ueda is expected to succeed BOJ Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda, the chief engineer of the current policy, when his second 5-year term ends in April. The nomination requires parliamentary approval. 

            The BOJ’s monetary policy was designed to fight off deflation, and Japan’s inflation rate has stayed relatively low compared with the U.S. and Europe. 

            “Time is needed before the effects of monetary policy kick in,” Ueda told Parliament, noting the price rises are peaking. 

            The change of leadership at the central bank has drawn global attention, with speculation Ueda may unwind the monetary easing that Kuroda installed nearly a decade ago. 

            But he countered such expectations, saying that the current policy stance is needed to achieve stable consumer prices and rising wages. He also stressed the Bank of Japan was cooperating closely with central banks around the world and international monetary officials. 

            Ueda has been a BOJ policy board member in the past but has a mostly academic background. He will need to maneuver through challenging times. While overall inflation in Japan remains subdued, surging prices for oil, gas and other commodities have fed into prices for many consumer goods, utility rates and other costs. 

            The last time the core consumer price index rose as much as in January was in September 1981, according to the Statistics Bureau of Japan. At the time, oil prices had soared starting in the late 1970s in what was dubbed the “oil shock.” 

            Under Kuroda, the Bank of Japan set a target price rise of 2%, but prices have risen at a faster pace in recent months. Manufacturers and food outlets have been announcing price rises, one after the other. 

            Ueda said more time is needed to see that price increases are stable.

            The change of BOJ leadership may signal a shift from the “Abenomics” economic policies of the late Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, said Haruhiko Sato, an economics analyst. 

            “The markets are feeling a trifle unsettled in anticipation of a shift in policy, even if it were to come gradually,” he said in a recent report. 

            Wage increases generally have not kept pace with inflation, adding to hardships for some households at a time when the Japanese yen has weakened against the U.S. dollar and other currencies. That boosts the purchasing prices of imports, including energy and food. 

            Japan avoided slipping into recession late last year, eking out a 0.6% percent annual pace of growth in October-December following a contraction in the previous quarter. The easing of COVID-19 restrictions, both abroad and in Japan, have brought a recovery in tourism and other economic activity.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820198,"Doncic, Irving get 1st tandem win as Mavs rout hapless Spurs","DALLAS (AP) — Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving have their first win together in Dallas — on the highest-scoring and best shooting night from 3-point range this season for the Mavericks.

            Doncic had 28 points, 10 assists and seven rebounds and Irving scored 23 points in a 142-116 victory over the woeful San Antonio Spurs on Thursday night.

            The Mavericks stopped a three-game losing streak in the return from the All-Star break, while the Spurs extended their franchise-record skid to 15 games with their 20th loss in 21 games.











            With Doncic and Irving directing the offense, Dallas topped its previous season high of 137 and shot 52% from 3, making 22 of 42. 

            Tim Hardaway Jr. went 6 of 11 from deep and scored 22 points after missing the last two games before the break with hamstring tightness. 

            Justin Holiday made 5 of 6 from beyond the arc for 15 points in his Dallas debut eight days after signing with the club as the Mavericks finished with eight players in double figures.

            “People say that Luka and Ky need the ball,” coach Jason Kidd said. “Well, they also know how to use their teammates, and their teammates are delivering right now.”

            The start of the opener of a six-game homestand, longest of the season for Dallas, was delayed about 20 minutes because of moisture on the court. Larger-than-normal crews worked before the game and at halftime to dry the court.

            Malaki Branham led San Antonio with 23 points, and Keldon Johnson had 22 points, eight rebounds and seven assists. The Spurs are nearing the end of their annual rodeo road trip, a nine-game trek this year.

            Doncic did all of his work in the first three quarters, because Irving eliminated the need for the soon-to-be 24-year-old to play in the fourth.

            Irving scored or assisted on 13 consecutive points early in the fourth quarter as a 10-point lead ballooned to 25 before the seven-minute mark. Irving had six assists and combined with Doncic to make 15 of 16 free throws.

            “It's definitely tough, two of the best iso guys in the league on the same team,” Branham said. “Played them solid and made them kick out to other players. The other players made shots.”

            Leading by four when Irving joined Doncic with four minutes remaining in the first half, Dallas pushed the lead to 11 at the break.

            Doncic assisted on consecutive dunks by Dwight Powell before a three-point play from Doncic and a turnaround jumper by Irving, who then assisted on 3-pointers from Reggie Bullock and Doncic.

            Irving split two defenders as he twisted through the lane on a reverse layup for a 74-63 lead just 0.3 seconds before the first-half buzzer. Doncic watched, and laughed, from midcourt.

            “It was insane,” Doncic said. “It was like three, four people and him and he still got an open layup. That’s why I was laughing.”

            Christian Wood scored 16 points, Reggie Bullock had 12 on 4-of-6 shooting from 3, Josh Green scored 11 and Powell had 10.

            Charles Bassey scored 16 points for San Antonio, Keita Bates-Diop added 15 and Zach Collins had 13 points and 12 rebounds.

            ANOTHER TECH, DIFFERENT REF

            Doncic was called for a technical foul in the first quarter in Dallas’ first game with the crew from a December loss in Minnesota when he was given two immediately and ejected. The ejection was assessed by Rodney Mott. This technical came from Karl Lane, who coincidentally shares Doncic’s No. 77. 

            It was the 12th technical for Doncic. Players must serve a one-game suspension if they get 16 in the regular season, but the count doesn’t carry into the playoffs.

Larger-than-normal crews worked before the game and at halftime to dry the court.Malaki Branham led San Antonio with 23 points, and Keldon Johnson had 22 points, eight rebounds and seven assists.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820201,Pettersson's OT goal lifts Canucks to 3-2 win over Blues,"ST. LOUIS (AP) — Elias Pettersson had 10 shots. He connected on the last one.

            Pettersson scored 4:45 into overtime, and the Vancouver Canucks rallied for a 3-2 victory over the St. Louis Blues on Thursday night.

            ""I felt good, but the puck wouldn’t find the way in until the last shot I guess so I’m happy with that,” he said.











            Pettersson picked up his 28th goal when he beat goalie Jordan Binnington with a wrist shot.

            “I had some ice to work with so I tried to get as much speed as possible,” Pettersson said. “I was thinking of going towards the inside but he covered that so I thought I’d try to shoot far and it went in.”

            Coach Rick Tocchet, who was hired Jan. 22 after Bruce Boudreau was let go, was impressed.

            “That was a laser,” Tocchet said. “He's got an all-world shot. He had a lot of chances in the game.”

            St. Louis led 2-0 before Miller scored his 20th goal 9:08 into the third, and Kuzmenko tied it on his 27th in the final minute. 

            “A lot of our best players not doing the job,” St. Louis coach Craig Berube said. “I guess they don’t care about the team, I don’t know. Not sure why.”

            Rookie Tyler Tucker scored his first career goal for the Blues, and Alexey Toropchenko had a short-handed goal. Binnington made 38 saves.

            “Obviously it’s nice to be rewarded,” Tucker said about scoring his first goal. “Two points would’ve been better.”

            Vancouver rookie Arturs Silovs had 20 stops in his third career NHL start. 

            Vancouver had a goal disallowed in the first period. Miller scored on a delayed penalty at 14:27, but it was waved off after St. Louis challenged for goaltender interference.

            The Blues scored a short-handed goal when Toropchenko beat Silovs on a breakaway at 15:29. Pavel Buchnevich intercepted a pass and fed the streaking Toropechenko for his fifth of the season.

            “That game was like, I don’t know what to say, but it’s like frustrating me. I don’t know. It’s really bad,"" Toropchenko said. ""I am trying to do everything that I can every game, and I am just wishing and hoping everybody on the same page. But it’s not good enough. I am so upset.”

            St. Louis went up 2-0 on a wrist shot by Tucker at 6:45 of the second. The Canucks challenged the play, arguing the goal was scored on a high stick by Ivan Barbashev, but the original call stood. Barbashev got his 100th career assist.

            Miller scored a short-handed goal on a wrist shot. He has 11 points in his last 10 games.

            “All these games are important. We’ve got guys fighting for jobs,” Miller said. “We’ve got guys trying to prove something to the new coach. We didn’t get frustrated. We’ve scored a lot of 6 on 5 goals. That says a lot about our team. We’re never out of it.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820202,CLG Group Assists SMEs in Increasing Accounting Efficacy with Cloud Technology,"HONG KONG SAR -  Media OutReach - 24 February 2023 - With the increasingly popular green economy, the concept of ESG investment has entered the public eye more and more frequently. Compared with the traditional accounting companies in the past, recently a diversified model combined with cloud technology has gradually been derived and popularized in many companies to achieve the effective strategic goals of corporate ESG advocated.            ESG is a newly emerging concept of social enterprises and there is still a long way to go in the future. With the global attention to ESG investment, there will definitely be many changes and opportunities.   CEO of CLG group, Jason Law said, the company has become the partner of the cloud-based accounting software Xero by combining sustainable innovation and technology. The company focuses on the use of cloud solutions, which greatly improves the efficiency and effectiveness of streamlining business processes. CLG Group is designed to operate as one and work together with a strong set of values, including the commitment of trust and integrity, and hopes to make a positive social impact through the work and the business they run. The team members consist of Xero-certified advisors, guiding our clients to transform their businesses with solid experiences and knowledge.   CLG Group is composed of several professionals, including a fellow member(practicing) of Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants, member of The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales(ICAEW), member of Certified Practicing Accountant Australia(CPAA), a fellow member of The Hong Kong Chartered Governance Institute(HKCGI), member of The Society of Chinese Accountants and Auditors, fellow member of The Taxation Institute of Hong Kong, member of The Hong Kong Independent Non-Executive Director Association. The company's service targets include experience and expertise in many different industries, including food and beverage manufacturing, clothing and eyewear manufacturing, electronic component trading, watches, online payment platforms, mining consulting, financial leasing operations, construction, etc.   CLG Group is working continuously to improve the quality of our services, investing in our people and innovation, through four main service lines—Assurance and Accounting, Advisory, Cloud Solutions, and Tax. Other services including company secretarial services, payroll outsourcing services, internal monitoring, audit of government funding schemes, BUD funding, Technology Voucher (TVP), cloud accounting system, human resource system, POS system, bookkeeping document recording system, online store etc. CLG Group is dedicated to helping clients solve their pressing challenges and realize their greatest ambitions in their business.   The benefits of the cloud accounting management system are very rich. Jason Law continued to point out that the computer system can analyze viewpoints and angles based on data in a short time and complete complex calculations and financial processing. With the data recorded by the system, the required information can be found quickly without manual analysis, which greatly saves time and cost. Originally, it was necessary to manually handle complicated accounting procedures. With the accounting system, it is more convenient, quick, and easy to divide and simplify. Moreover, when some enterprises have difficulty in recruiting professional accounting staff in a short period of time or the manpower is scarce, the system can quickly solve this problem—employees who are not that proficient in accounting can easily master the skills and quickly operate the system to complete the document procedures to settle business matters.   In addition, the accounting system can display different accounting data in the company in a multi-functional way, further exerting the value of accounting. It can also do correct and effective analysis and processing of accounting data. The computerized accounting system will be the basis of the Management Information System (MIS).   In terms of overall efficiency, establishing a cost accounting record system to provide relevant accounting information at any time allows managers to evaluate, analyse and improve production performance. The staff in charge of the department can fully understand the company's computerized accounting operation process, which makes the accounting operation more rational and timesaving, and optimizes the overall operating efficiency. Also, this system helps to strengthen the knowledge of accounting and tax laws for accountants, conduct a comprehensive inventory, stocktaking and establishment of files for the company and provide operators with timely control of the current financial situation and operating efficiency.   CLG Group always purposes ""Smart Accounting for the Happy Life"". Jason Law emphasized that the company aims to provide insights and high-quality service to help build trust and support for clients and has always been passionate about finding solutions that help clients work smarter and happier every day. CLG Group also plays a vital role in creating positive change for the team, clients and the community with the highest quality of service.  Hashtag: #CLGGroup

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820229,Incoming BOJ chief says low rates remain appropriate - for now,"Incoming Bank of Japan (BOJ) Governor Kazuo Ueda said on Friday the central bank must maintain ultra-low interest rates to support the fragile economy, warning of the dangers of responding to cost-driven inflation with monetary tightening.While signalling the chance of tweaking the BOJ's bond yield curve control (YCC) in the future, Ueda said the bank needed to work out the right timing and means to do so, a sign the new chief will be in no rush to overhaul the controversial policy.Speaking to lawmakers, Ueda said the recent rise in inflation is driven largely by rising raw material import costs, rather than strong demand, adding the outlook for Japan's economy was highly uncertain.Global bond yields fell and Japanese stocks rallied as Ueda's emphasis on patience and continuity in policy tempered some market expectation that he might seek to make a hasty exit from the extreme monetary stimulus of his dovish predecessor, Haruhiko Kuroda.""It's standard practice to act preemptively to demand-driven inflation, but not respond immediately to supply-driven inflation,"" Ueda told a lower house confirmation hearing.""Japan's trend inflation is likely to rise gradually. But it will take some time for inflation to sustainably and stably achieve the BOJ's 2% target,"" he said.""It's true there are various side-effects emerging from the stimulus. But the BOJ's current policy is a necessary, appropriate means to achieve 2% inflation.""The yen JPY=EBS was volatile, swinging between gains and losses against the dollar as investors parsed through Ueda's comments. It was last off 0.03% at 134.76 per dollar.Earlier this month, the government named the 71-year-old academic as its pick to become next central bank governor in a surprise choice that markets initially saw as heightening the chance of an end to the unpopular YCC policy.With inflation exceeding the BOJ's target, Ueda faces the delicate task of phasing out YCC, which has drawn public criticism for distorting market functions and crushing banks' margins.""There are various possibilities on what YCC could look like in the future,"" he said, adding that there were side-effects emerging from the policy such as deteriorating market function.But he said for now, the BOJ needed to monitor whether the measures it took in December, such as widening the band around its yield target, will help ease the side-effects.Ueda's caution against shifting policy too soon was echoed by Shinichi Uchida, a career central banker and the government's deputy BOJ governor nominee, who said it was inappropriate to tweak ultra-loose policy just to deal with its side-effects.""The BOJ's current interest rate target levels, including the negative short-term rate, is appropriate. If Japan can foresee inflation reaching 2%, the target levels could be reviewed. But that won't come immediately,"" Uchida told lawmakers in the same confirmation hearing.EXIT POSSIBILITIESTargeting shorter-maturity bond yields, rather than the current 10-year yield, may be among options, though there are various other ideas if the BOJ were to tweak YCC in the future, Ueda said.""If trend inflation heightens significantly and sustained achievement of the BOJ's 2% target comes into sight, the central bank must consider normalising monetary policy,"" Ueda said.In phasing out stimulus, the BOJ would do so by raising interest rates on financial institutions' reserves parked with the central bank rather than selling bonds, Ueda said.Upon approval by parliament, Ueda succeeds incumbent Kuroda, whose second, five-year term ends on April 8.""Overall Ueda is working hard to present himself as delivering continuity - at least to start with,"" said Sean Callow, senior currency strategist at Westpac. ""Now is not the time to put his own stamp on policy; that's not why the government selected him.""The upper house of parliament will hold the confirmation hearing for Ueda on Monday, and that for the two deputies on Tuesday.The nominations need the approval of both chambers of the Diet, which are effectively done deals as the ruling coalition holds solid majorities in both.Under YCC, the BOJ guides short-term interest rates at -0.1% and the 10-year bond yield around 0% as part of efforts to sustainably achieve its 2% inflation target.Facing pressure from rising global interest rates, the BOJ was forced to raise in December the implicit cap for its 10-year yield target to 0.5% from 0.25% - a move that fuelled market expectations of an imminent tweak to YCC.(Reporting by Leika Kihara; Additional reporting by Tom Westbrook in Singapore; Editing by Sam Holmes)",2023/02/24,124,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820235,Brad Paisley pens country song featuring Ukraine's Zelenskyy,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — A year ago, country star Brad Paisley watched the news on television as Russian troops invaded Ukraine and, like many people around the world, he felt helpless at the images of people fleeing their homes.

            “The world felt like it was in a new place that it hadn’t been in decades,"" the three-time Grammy winner recalls.

            On Friday, the one-year anniversary of the war's start, Paisley is releasing a new song called “Same Here,"" featuring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy speaking proudly about his country and people.











            The song is Paisley's first from his new record, “Son of the Mountains,” to be released later this year on Universal Music Group Nashville.

            The West Virginia native wrote the song with Lee Thomas Miller (co-writer on Paisley hits “The World” and “Perfect Storm”) and Dawes frontman Taylor Goldsmith. It's a three-part narrative that reflects on universal similarities, despite distance and language. 

            While it doesn't mention Ukraine specifically, the song ends with Paisley and Zelenskyy in conversation, recorded during a video call. Zelenskyy talks about Ukrainians' desire for freedom, adding “There is no distance between our two countries in such values.”

            “There’s just no differences,"" Paisley told The Associated Press. “You can put us in different places with different flags and different languages, but we have so many similarities.”

            Paisley is one of several celebrity ambassadors for Ukraine's United24 crowdfunding effort, and has donated his time for other fundraising efforts to assist Ukrainians. But even he thought it would be a long shot to have the direct involvement of Zelenskyy, who has traveled the world advocating for Ukraine's military and recovery efforts. 

            “I think he understands that art is how you reach the most people, especially in the heart,"" Paisley said of Zelenskyy, who was an actor and comedian before becoming president. 

            ""He can give as many speeches as he can give, but it's a lot easier to hear something with a melody maybe.”

            Zelenskyy didn't just sign off on the song; he also suggested some changes to it, Paisley said. 

            Paisley's royalties for the song will be donated to United24 to help build housing for thousands of displaced Ukrainians whose homes were destroyed in the war, he said. Using his platform to advocate for causes important to him has always been part of his career, whether it was opening a free grocery store in Nashville with his wife, Kimberly Williams-Paisley, or fighting hunger by donating 1 million meals during the pandemic. 

            “I wouldn’t be able to sleep at night if I didn’t sort of swing for the fence with things like this,"" Paisley said. “For me, I’m happiest dealing with stuff as a songwriter that’s very true and very, very passionate. And sometimes I don’t know if you’d call it risky, but it’s more like it’s bigger than me.”

            Paisley brings his passion on stage during live shows. He's been changing the lyrics to his hit song “American Saturday Night,” for instance, to replace a reference to the U.S.S.R. to “There's a Ukrainian flag hanging up behind the bar."" 

            The new record will be his debut on UMG since moving from Sony's Arista label, and he said “Same Here” reflects the kinds of big universal themes on it. 

            “We do deal with stuff going on in the world,"" Paisley said. ""How do you sing about things that are truly big — a big deal right now — that also don’t feel like maybe they’re the type of thing that you would be singing about typically? And yeah, on this album I have kind of really dug deep and tried to say something.”

            Paisley, who has visited U.S. troops in Afghanistan, said he's been invited to visit Ukraine, which he'd like to do. In the meantime, he hopes the song's message will bolster the country now facing down year two of the war. 

            “That’s where it gets really rewarding... feeling like maybe the heart of this helps paint the picture they want to paint,"" Paisley said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820245,Shannon’s surge rallies Illinois past No. 21 Northwestern,"CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (AP) — Terrence Shannon Jr. shook off a slow start in his return from a concussion, scoring 24 of his 26 points in the second half as Illinois rallied from an 18-point halftime deficit to beat No. 21 Northwestern 66-62 on Thursday night.

            Shannon did not start and found himself back on the bench with three fouls as Northwestern (20-8, 11-6 Big Ten) closed on a 13-2 run to take a 37-19 lead into halftime.

            But he picked up steam after the break and scored 15 of the Illini’s last 24 points as they erased a 14-point deficit in the final 10:07. His tiebreaking drive with 1:16 left put Illinois (19-9, 10-7) ahead 63-61, and he scored the team's last five points — including a pair of free throws that sealed it with two seconds to go.











            Illinois coach Brad Underwood said he was unsure Shannon would be available to play until he cleared concussion protocol at shootaround.

            “Terrence was electric, getting downhill, getting to the foul line,” Underwood said.

            Boo Buie led Northwestern with a career-high 35 points, hitting six 3-pointers and going 12 of 24 from the floor.

            Illinois opened 0 for 11 from 3-point range before Shannon nailed two 3s early in the second half. Matthew Mayer added a 3 and hit three free throws after being fouled during a 14-1 run that winnowed the deficit to four with 15:06 left. 

            Mayer gave Illinois its first lead on two free throws with 2:36 remaining. He finished with 14 points and eight rebounds.

            “I thought we got a little bit stagnant,” Northwestern coach Chris Collins said. “I’ve got to do a better job helping the guys with that.”

            Shannon said he was focused entirely on shoring up the Illini’s leaky defense after the Wildcats hit eight 3-pointers in the first half. 

            “My thought process through the end of the game was just to get stops,” Shannon said. “I didn’t really care about the offensive end.”

            Buie kept chugging away for the Wildcats after scoring 22 in the first half, including five 3s, by hitting his first four shots after halftime to push Northwestern’s lead back to 14.

            “I actually thought we did a pretty good job after they hit us with the initial burst, we got (the lead) back to 12 or 14 there,” Collins said. “Then give them credit, they came storming back. We just couldn’t match them offensively in the second half.”

            The Wildcats were attempting to string together their second six-game Big Ten winning streak in the last 90 years. 

            Illinois climbed into a four-way tie for third place in the conference with three games left in the regular season. Northwestern remains in second but fell two games behind Purdue.

            BIG PICTURE

            Northwestern: The fact that a close road loss to an Illini program that has dominated the Wildcats in recent years is a disappointment is a sign of major progress after Collins started the season on the hot seat. The winningest Big Ten regular-season team in Northwestern men’s basketball history is hoping for some magic when the calendar turns to March.

            Illinois: Shannon’s return in a gritty home win to avoid a season sweep by an in-state conference rival was a needed development for the Illini, who lack the 3-point shooting prowess of some of the nation’s premier teams. Underwood’s group has repeatedly dug itself early holes this season, and finally got out of one Thursday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820268,Judge OK's Arizona rancher trial in Mexican migrant killing,"PHOENIX (AP) — An Arizona rancher accused of shooting at a group of migrants on his property near the U.S.-Mexico border, killing one man, will face trial on charges including second-degree murder and aggravated assault, a judge ruled Friday.

            Santa Cruz County Justice of the Peace Emilio G. Velasquez made his decision following hours of testimony that he said aired a lot of new information about the Jan. 30 shooting, which left Gabriel Cuen-Buitimea, a 48-year-old from Nogales, Mexico, dead on George Alan Kelly’s ranch outside Nogales, Arizona.

            “Do I think there was some testimony that there might have been some holes on? Yes. I do,"" the judge said. “But at the end of the day ... the court does find that the offenses were committed by this defendant and I will be binding this over to Superior Court.”











            There was no visible reaction from Kelly, who sat with his attorney, Brenna Larkin, during a livestream of the evidentiary hearing in Nogales.

            The judge said Kelly, 74, can remain free on $1 million bail pending his March 6 arraignment, with restrictions including no contact with witnesses or Cuen-Buitimea's family and a ban on possessing firearms.

            Larkin earlier lost a bid to postpone Friday's hearing after prosecutors lowered Kelly's charge from a single count of first-degree murder, which would require a finding of premeditated intent to kill and can lead to a sentence of death or life imprisonment.

            Chief Deputy County Attorney Kimberly Hunley told the judge that prosecutors intend to prove second-degree murder — that Kelly had no basis for “intentionally, knowingly, or under circumstances recklessly” shooting an AK-47 rifle toward eight or so unarmed migrants about 80 to 100 yards (meters) away.

            “There is no justification for shooting an unarmed man in the back,” Hunley told the judge.

            During a warrant search of Kelly's house following the shooting, sheriff's deputies found several weapons but at first missed the AK-47. They returned with a second warrant and found it hanging on a door.

            Larkin said her client shot into the air above the migrants. She has said Kelly feared for his and his wife's safety and the property. 

            On Friday she pointed to phone calls Kelly made the day of the killing to U.S. Border Patrol agents he knew from previous incidents at his ranch, reporting that he heard shooting outside and “he might have to return fire or he is returning fire, something along those lines.”

            “He sees armed people with rifles carrying backpacks going through his property, and he sees his horse running,” the defense attorney told the judge. She noted that two Border Patrol agents familiar with Kelly's ranch testified “that is a high-crime area, that there are a lot of drug traffickers that go through that area.”

            Larkin repeatedly asked sheriff's deputies and Border Patrol agents who testified about “bias in the investigation” and told the judge she thought investigators scrutinized Kelly's statements more closely than those of witnesses.

            Kelly did not testify. He apparently wrote about his borderlands ranching life in the self-published “Far Beyond the Border Fence,” described on Amazon.com as a “contemporary novel which brings the Mexican Border/Drug conflict into the 21st century.”

            Friday's hearing featured sometimes-conflicting testimony from law enforcement agents and witnesses, including a Mexican man who recounted hearing gunfire and running behind Cuen-Buitimea when the victim said he had been shot, fell and died.

            ""I saw Gabriel,” said the man, who spoke through a Spanish-language interpreter and was referred to by the initials D.R.R. to protect his identity. “He held his chest and said, ‘I’m hit.’ He rolled his eyes and fell down.”

            The court cut the video stream and provided only audio of the testimony from D.R.R., a farmworker in Mexico who said he had made “seven or eight” tries to cross the border to find work but was apprehended each time. 

            Court records show Cuen-Buitimea also entered the U.S. illegally several times, and was convicted and deported, most recently in 2016. 

            D.R.R. testified that he and Cuen-Buitimea, whom he called a friend, had paid a guide for passage across the border on Jan. 30 and were heading to Phoenix. He also said neither of them was carrying a weapon, and the guide had left them. Cuen-Buitimea was wearing a green camouflage backpack as well as a bag on his belt.

            The man said he believed he heard 15 or 16 shots fired as the group ran. A sheriff's deputy testified that investigators recovered nine shell casings near Kelly's south-facing back porch.

            D.R.R said that as he fled he saw a man with white hair near the house and something in the man's hand. He did not identify the object as a gun.

            “I ran 20 meters (22 yards) when I turned around to see him,” D.R.R. said. “I turned around to see if it was government agents coming after us. I was able to jump and I jumped the wall back to Mexico.”

            Two other migrants also told authorities that Kelly shot at them. They, too, were not hit and managed to escape back to Mexico.

            Hunley has said her office, the court and the sheriff's department ""have all received disturbing communications, some threatening in nature, that seem to indicate an ongoing threat to the safety of the victims.”

            The shooting has stirred emotions as the national debate over border security heats up ahead of the 2024 presidential election. 

            Less than six months ago, a prison warden and his brother were arrested in a West Texas shooting in which one migrant was killed and another was wounded. Michael and Mark Sheppard, both 60, were charged with manslaughter in the September shooting.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820272,Tired of Texans running for president? 2024 may be reprieve,"AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — It’s early yet, but next year’s presidential race may feature something the political world hasn't seen in the last 50 years: no Texans.

            The Texas-size hole in the field will be on stark display Friday at a closed Republican donor event outside the state capital, Austin, featuring the likes of former Vice President Mike Pence, who is expected to mount a campaign, and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who announced her bid last week.

            Some Texans could still run. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott won’t decide until after Memorial Day. Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, who ran in 2016, says he’s focused for now on reelection next year. Will Hurd, a onetime CIA agent and former Republican congressman from San Antonio, is seriously considering a bid and may bring on staff, aides say.











            If none of them seeks the White House, it’d be the first time since 1972 without at least one major candidate who rose to public prominence in Texas or lived in the state while running for or holding office.

            Finding the next most recent Texan-less presidential cycle requires going all the way back to 1952, four years before Lyndon B. Johnson made his first attempt at the White House. 

            “Clearly, there’s some constitutional amendment that voters supported back in the day that says, ‘If you’re a governor of Texas, you must consider running for president,’” joked Dave Carney, Abbott's chief strategist and a top strategist to Texas Gov. Rick Perry's 2012 presidential bid. “And many of them have. For good or bad.”

            Some Texans' White House runs were indeed forgettable. 

            That includes Democratic Sen. Lloyd Bentsen’s 1976 run and bids by Republican Rep. Ron Paul in 2008 and Republican Sen. Phil Gramm in 1996. John Connally was Texas’ Democratic governor from 1963 until 1969 but sought the White House as a Republican in 1980. Dallas businessman Ross Perot never held elected office but mounted major presidential campaigns in 1992 and 1996.

            Indeed, if this cycle proceeds without a Texas official, it won't be a sign of the state’s waning political influence. Texas’ booming population has added nearly 4 million residents since 2010 while getting younger and more diverse. Its strong economy has attracted tech companies and corporate stalwarts who have flocked in from around the country.

            Texas has also become a bastion of conservative priorities, enacting one of the nation’s strictest anti-abortion laws even before the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and dramatically loosening gun restrictions while calling for federal crackdowns along the U.S.-Mexico border.

            “I think every year a Texan’s not in the presidential race is disappointing to me,” said George Seay, a major GOP donor based in Dallas who was Perry’s finance chair in 2012 and supported Marco Rubio in 2016.

            “With all due respect to Florida, which is an incredibly compelling, right-leaning state from a political standpoint,” Seay added, “Texas is the sun, the moon and the stars.” 

            A possible presidential race without a Texan would be a departure from recent cycles, which featured more than one. The 2012 GOP presidential primary pitted Paul against Perry and 2016's featured Perry and Cruz. Former Rep. Beto O'Rourke and former San Antonio Mayor Julián Castro both ran in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary.

            Although only three presidents have actually called Texas home, the state has left a mark on Washington. 

            Long after he left office, a Braniff Airlines flight dubbed the “LBJ Special” continued to fly from Washington Dulles to Austin every afternoon, an unusual nonstop flight for the time. President George W. Bush's ranch in Crawford, Texas, was the “Western White House” but only because Johnson’s ranch in Stonewall, where he spent nearly a quarter of his presidency, had already claimed the “Texas White House” moniker. 

            Bush even flew his favorite caterer, Eddie Deen, from suburban Dallas to Washington to serve smoked ribs and stuffed jalapenos at his inaugural balls. His father, President George H.W. Bush, was a congressman from Houston and incorporated the state's rugged ethos into his political brand, trying to season his Northeast upbringing with a dash of down-home. 

            “Everything is bigger in Texas, including the egos of our already outsize politicians,” said Mark Updegrove, CEO of the Lyndon Baines Johnson Foundation, who noted that playing up their Texas swagger has paid off through the decades for presidential candidates from both parties. 

            Since the modern era of presidential campaigning began in 1972, Texans have been involved in more cycles than any other state. Candidates from California have launched more overall bids at 19, according to Eric Ostermeier, a research fellow at University of Minnesota’s Hubert H. Humphrey School of Public Affairs. But Texans and New Yorkers are second, producing 15 total candidacies each.

            Ostermeier says he counts a home state as where a candidate rose to public prominence or lived when they ran for office. That means Houston-born Marianne Williamson, who lives in Beverly Hills and is readying a 2024 Democratic presidential bid, would qualify as a Californian. 

            More clarity on possible Texans in the 2024 primary campaign will come after the state Legislature adjourns in late May. Carney said Abbott will then “look at what the state of the race is, and does he have something that would be differentiating to the race that would be attractive to voters.” 

            “The governor will not be a spoiler,” Carney said. “But, if he thinks he has something to offer, he might run. If he thinks there’s enough folks running with the same, similar ideas that he has,” then probably not. 

            Hurd, who retired from Congress in 2021 after three terms representing Texas' most competitive House district, traveled to New Hampshire recently and is planning trips to other early primary states. 

            Cruz says he's concentrating on his Senate race next year but hasn't ruled out another presidential run. He could do both. Texas’ so-called LBJ law allows running for Senate and president simultaneously, and Bentsen was reelected to his seat while losing the vice presidency in 1988. 

            A Cruz aide called the prospect of no Texans in the presidential race since 1972 a “clever bit of trivia.” ___

            Weissert reported from Washington.AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — It’s early yet, but next year’s presidential race may feature something the political world hasn't seen in the last 50 years: no Texans.The Texas-size hole in the field will be on stark display Friday at a closed Republican donor event outside the state capital, Austin, featuring the likes of former Vice President Mike Pence, who is expected to mount a campaign, and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who announced her bid last week.Some Texans could still run. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott won’t decide until after Memorial Day. Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, who ran in 2016, says he’s focused for now on reelection next year. Will Hurd, a onetime CIA agent and former Republican congressman from San Antonio, is seriously considering a bid and may bring on staff, aides say.If none of them seeks the White House, it’d be the first time since 1972 without at least one major candidate who rose to public prominence in Texas or lived in the state while running for or holding office.Finding the next most recent Texan-less presidential cycle requires going all the way back to 1952, four years before Lyndon B. Johnson made his first attempt at the White House.“Clearly, there’s some constitutional amendment that voters supported back in the day that says, ‘If you’re a governor of Texas, you must consider running for president,’” joked Dave Carney, Abbott's chief strategist and a top strategist to Texas Gov. Rick Perry's 2012 presidential bid. “And many of them have. For good or bad.”Some Texans' White House runs were indeed forgettable.That includes Democratic Sen. Lloyd Bentsen’s 1976 run and bids by Republican Rep. Ron Paul in 2008 and Republican Sen. Phil Gramm in 1996. John Connally was Texas’ Democratic governor from 1963 until 1969 but sought the White House as a Republican in 1980. Dallas businessman Ross Perot never held elected office but mounted major presidential campaigns in 1992 and 1996.Indeed, if this cycle proceeds without a Texas official, it won't be a sign of the state’s waning political influence. Texas’ booming population has added nearly 4 million residents since 2010 while getting younger and more diverse. Its strong economy has attracted tech companies and corporate stalwarts who have flocked in from around the country.Texas has also become a bastion of conservative priorities, enacting one of the nation’s strictest anti-abortion laws even before the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and dramatically loosening gun restrictions while calling for federal crackdowns along the U.S.-Mexico border.“I think every year a Texan’s not in the presidential race is disappointing to me,” said George Seay, a major GOP donor based in Dallas who was Perry’s finance chair in 2012 and supported Marco Rubio in 2016.“With all due respect to Florida, which is an incredibly compelling, right-leaning state from a political standpoint,” Seay added, “Texas is the sun, the moon and the stars.”A possible presidential race without a Texan would be a departure from recent cycles, which featured more than one.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820275,Golden Knights rally from 2 down in 3rd to beat Flames in OT,"LAS VEGAS (AP) — The Vegas Golden Knights had plenty going against them Thursday night, getting badly outshot in the first period and trailing by two goals in the third.

            Then they turned it around, scoring twice to force overtime before Alex Pietrangelo knocked in a rebound 42 seconds into the extra period to defeat the Calgary Flames 4-3.

            “I thought we chipped away more as the game went on,” Pietrangelo said. “We were more aggressive, I think. They're on a back-to-back, and we kind of put them on their heels.”











            The Knights, who lead the Western Conference with 75 points, extended their points streak to eight games. They are 6-0-2 during that stretch.

            “You've got to be able to win those games if you expect to advance (in the playoffs),"" Knights coach Bruce Cassidy said. “We've got to get there first, and that's where these two points really matter. That is a bigger sign to me, the big picture is we can play these games against a heavy team.”

            Zach Whitecloud and William Carrier scored in the third period for Vegas to erase the two-goal deficit.

            Then in overtime, Jonathan Marchessault took a shot from the slot that nearly went into the net, but dropped behind Calgary goalie Dan Vladar. Pietrangelo was there to knock in the puck. Jack Eichel had the secondary assist for his second point of the night after earlier scoring a goal.

            Eichel's goal came on a second-period power play. His shot from the left circle ended a skid of 25 chances without a power-play goal, and the Knights had converted just one of their previous 32.

            Jakob Pelletier, Jonathan Huberdeau and Mikael Backlund had goals for the Flames. This was Backlund’s fourth game in a row with a goal, and he has eight points in his past five games.

            Backlund and Pelletier each had two points.

            Calgary dominated early taking 16 of the first 18 shots on goals, outshooting the Knights 18-8 overall in the first period. The Flames had three power plays in the period, taking five shots on goal on their first man advantage and scoring on the second one.

            Vegas was fortunate to only be down a goal after the first, with Laurent Brossoit coming up with key saves among his 17 stops in the period.

            “I don’t think we ever thought we couldn’t win it,” Cassidy said. “I wasn’t sure in the first period we felt that way.”

            Brossoit wound up making 25 saves for his first victory since March 4 at Anaheim. He had offseason hip surgery and then spent nearly the entire season playing for the Knights' American Hockey League affiliate in Henderson before injuries at the top level gave him this opportunity.

            “I've been waiting for this all year,” Brossoit said.

            His wait nearly had to last a little longer when the Flames took 3-1 lead in the second period, but the advantage didn't hold up as Calgary played just a night after winning 6-3 at Arizona. Calgary had just one shot on goal in the final period of regulation.

            “I think fatigue caught up with us a little bit,” Flames coach Darryl Sutter said. “I think the second goal, the goalie would like to have that back, for sure. A 3-1 game, you like to take that as far into the period as you can.”

            NOTES: Calgary's Noah Hanifin extended his points streak to three (four assists). ... Vegas' Shea Theodore has eight points over a five-game streak, totaling two goals and six assists.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820276,No. 15 Saint Mary's tops Pacific 83-52 for WCC title share,"MORAGA, Calif. (AP) — Logan Johnson scored 29 points in the final home game of his career and No. 15 Saint Mary's clinched at least a share of the West Coast Conference regular-season title with an 83-52 victory over Pacific on Thursday night.

            “It’s nice that we were able to clinch a share of it on our home court,” coach Randy Bennett said. “I wanted to make sure they would get recognized and win out on their home court the right way. ... For them to be able to win this thing on our home court, I definitely wanted the crowd to be able to show their appreciation.”

            Alex Ducas added 17 points and Mitchell Saxen scored 11 for the Gaels (25-5, 14-1). Saint Mary's is assured no worse than a tie for first place in the conference for the first time since 2015-16 and can secure its first outright crown since 2011-12 by winning at No. 12 Gonzaga on Saturday night.











            The Gaels held a trophy ceremony at midcourt after the game and put on championship T-shirts. But the celebration didn't last long, with a bigger game looming. 

            “About 10 more minutes until I shower and go home,” Ducas said of how long he'd celebrate this win. “We'll get our minds right. We have bigger things to focus on. There's plenty more time to celebrate after the season is done.” 

            The Gaels wrapped up their second straight perfect home season in conference play with a victory that gave them 25 wins for the 12th time in the last 16 seasons. 

            Jordan Ivy-Curry scored 11 points to lead the Tigers (13-17, 6-9), who have lost five of six. 

            Johnson helped break the game open early, sparking a 21-6 run that gave Saint Mary's a 33-16 lead midway through the first half. He scored 12 points during that stretch, including a pair of 3-pointers to cap it.

            Johnson finished with 20 points in the half as the Gaels led 48-31 at the break. 

            Saint Mary's was never threatened in the second half, with Ducas' 3 making it 68-35 midway through the half. 

            SENIOR NIGHT

            The Gaels honored their three senior starters before the game: Johnson, Ducas and Kyle Bowen.

            All three have started every game the past two seasons, helping Saint Mary's earn a No. 5 seed in the NCAA tournament last year and putting the Gaels in position to win the conference title this season. 

            “These three guys are special,” Bennett said. “We may never have a group of three leaders, as seniors, as good as these guys. I know what special looks like and these guys are special.”

            Ducas and Bowen could choose to return for a fifth season because of the 2020 campaign impacted by COVID-19 but haven't made a final decision. 

            Saint Mary's reserve Matt Van Komen also was honored.

            BIG PICTURE

            Pacific: The Tigers lost their 34th straight game against a ranked opponent since beating No. 21 Providence in the first round of the 2004 NCAA Tournament. 

            Saint Mary’s: The Gaels have won four straight since their lone slip-up in conference play, an overtime loss at Loyola Marymount two weeks ago. But their toughest test yet comes in the finale at Gonzaga. Saint Mary's won the first matchup at home 78-70 in OT earlier this month.

(AP) — Terrence Shannon Jr. shook off a slow start in his return from a concussion, scoring 24 of his 26 points in the second half as Illinois rallied from an 18-point halftime deficit to beat No. 21 Northwestern 66-62 on Thursday night.

            Shannon did not start and found himself back on the bench with three fouls as Northwestern (20-8, 11-6 Big Ten) closed on a 13-2 run to take a 37-19 lead into halftime.

            But he picked up steam after the break and scored 15 of the Illini’s last 24 points as they erased a 14-point deficit in the final 10:07. His tiebreaking drive with 1:16 left put Illinois (19-9, 10-7) ahead 63-61, and he scored the team’s last five points — including a pair of free throws that sealed it with two seconds to go.











            Boo Buie led Northwestern with a career-high 35 points, hitting six 3-pointers and going 12 of 24 from the floor. The Wildcats had won five straight.

            NO. 4 UCLA 78, UTAH 71

            SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Jaime Jaquez Jr. scored 17 of his 23 points in the second half and Tyger Campbell added 18 to lift UCLA over Utah.

            Jaquez, who was UCLA’s only effective offensive player in the second half, made a 3-pointer with 1:03 remaining to seal the win just moments after Campbell hit a 3 from the corner.

            UCLA (24-4, 15-2 Pac-12) has won seven in a row despite giving up more than 70 points for just the fourth time this season.

            Mike Saunders Jr. came off the bench to score a career-high 25 points for Utah (17-12, 10-8), which has lost three straight. The Utes played without starting guards Rollie Worster and Gabe Madsen, who are both injured.

            NO. 12 GONZAGA 97, SAN DIEGO 72

            SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) — Drew Timme had 22 points and 13 rebounds to help Gonzaga beat San Diego for its fourth consecutive victory.

            Timme needs to average 19.3 points over the next three games to break Gonzaga’s career scoring record set by Frank Burgess in 1961.

            The Zags (23-6, 13-2 West Coast Conference) dug out of an early six-point deficit with a 19-2 run. Ben Gregg added 18 points and Julian Strawther scored 17 for Gonzaga.

            Jase Townsend had 15 points for the Toreros (11-18, 4-11), who have lost 15 straight to Gonzaga. USD has dropped four in a row overall and six of seven.

            NO. 15 SAINT MARY'S 83, PACIFIC 52

            MORAGA, Calif. (AP) — Logan Johnson scored 29 points in the final home game of his career and Saint Mary’s clinched at least a share of the West Coast Conference regular-season title with a victory over Pacific.

            Alex Ducas added 17 points and Mitchell Saxen scored 11 for the Gaels (25-5, 14-1). Saint Mary’s is assured no worse than a tie for first place in the conference for the first time since 2015-16 and can secure its first outright crown since 2011-12 by winning at No. 12 Gonzaga on Saturday night.

            The Gaels wrapped up their second straight perfect home season in conference play with a victory that gave them 25 wins for the 12th time in the last 16 seasons. 

            Jordan Ivy-Curry scored 11 points to lead the Tigers (13-17, 6-9), who have lost five of six.

            Markkanen scored 18 points in the fourth quarter, helping the Jazz rally from a nine-point deficit early in the period. Walker Kessler tipped in a layup with 4.6 seconds remaining to force overtime.

            Fresh off playing in his first All-Star Game on the Jazz's home floor, Markkanen is evolving into a crunch-time leader for Utah.











            “Yeah, I’m more confident,” Markkanen said. “My mindset going into games is go make a difference and be a finisher.”

            Jordan Clarkson added 24 points and six assists for Utah. Kessler had 18 rebounds and seven blocked shots, Kelly Olynyk and Ochai Agbaji chipped in 12 points apiece, and Kris Dunn added 11 in his Jazz debut.

            Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 39 points and missed a potential game-winning jumper at the overtime buzzer for the Thunder. He also had eight rebounds and seven assists. Josh Giddey added 18 points and 11 rebounds, Kenrich Williams had 16 points off the bench, and Lu Dort contributed 11 points and 11 boards.

            Oklahoma City never trailed after halftime until the closing seconds of overtime.

            “We haven’t been a 48-minute team in every single game this season,” Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said. “But when we’re not, I think our guys have a good recognition that the car is off the road and we get it back on the road quickly.” 

            Utah played without starting point guard Collin Sexton, who has a left hamstring injury. Talen Horton-Tucker made his second start of the season.

            The Thunder forced 22 turnovers and scored 20 points off them.

            Markkanen tied the game on a layup with 1:26 remaining. Oklahoma City again jumped out to a lead in overtime and maintained its advantage until Markkanen was fouled on a 3-point attempt in the closing seconds and made his free throws.

            “He’s played with a tremendous amount of aggressiveness,” Jazz coach Will Hardy said. “His physicality has gone up as the season has gone on.”

            Oklahoma City ended the first half on a 9-0 run to take a 55-46 halftime lead. Jaylin Williams started the run with a 3-pointer and Kenrich Williams finished it off with a reverse layup.

            Clarkson scored or assisted on Utah’s first six baskets in the second half and cut the deficit to 68-66 on a fadeaway jumper. The Thunder stopped the rally and built their only double-digit lead, going up 84-74 when Giddey drove for a reverse layup to cap a 10-3 run.

            “I thought our team showed a lot of resolve,” Hardy said. “We were, it felt like, down six to eight points for the majority of the game and just kept hanging around, kept battling.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820297,OPPO unveils new 6G white paper examining the future of world mobility,"The close integration of 6G and AI technologies represent a key direction in the future of 6G development, transforming the role of communications networks from ""connection"" to ""convergence"".   OPPO's proposed ""versatile 6G system with minimized kernel"" aims to help build the future mobile world.   OPPO is undertaking preliminary 6G research to explore the future of communications technology development.    SHENZHEN, CHINA -  Media OutReach - 24 February 2023 - OPPO today officially released its new 6G white paper -  A Versatile 6G with Minimized Kernel: To Build the Mobile World. Drawing on OPPO's forward-looking research and exploration into 6G, the white paper proposes an innovative 'versatile 6G system with minimized kernel' that aims to provide a more actionable solution for the next generation of mobile communication systems. The proposed system ""modularizes"" 6G capabilities and intelligently ""splices"" different capability modules according to the specific needs of any given scenario. This will enable 6G networks to be more adaptable and efficient when providing the underlying communications support for the convergence of masses of devices and networks in the future.            Bringing enhanced intelligence to connectivity with 6G   OPPO's vision for 5G and 6G technology is to enable a truly mobile world. Steps towards this mobile future have already been made with 5G, which has evolved the role of communications technology from simple ""connectivity"" to the Internet of Things with a multitude of different devices. Based on this vision, a key direction for the development of 6G technology will be the greater integration of AI technology into communications networks. Such networks will no longer be confined to just transmitting data: instead, they will be able to rapidly transmit and deploy a vast set of AI models. Among these models, a large number of AI agents will be trained to become intermediaries to help people manage and control all manner of things. As certain AI agents cannot exist in the physical world, this form of 'management' can only be realized in the virtual world. In these cases, digital twins representing physical objects will be constructed in the virtual world, enabling control of the physical world through these virtual proxies. In this way, 6G will help to further advance the Internet of Things from a series of connected devices to a series of converged devices operating as part of intelligent networks.   Based on this vision, the white paper proposes the role of 6G as one which facilitates communication between the virtual world and the real world, realizing the interconnection and convergence of these two worlds to form the basis of the metaverse and the foundations for a truly mobile world.    ""Versatile 6G system with minimized kernel"" meets the diverse needs of 6G   To realize this vision, OPPO has proposed a new design idea for 6G called ""the versatile 6G system with minimized kernel"". The concept consists of a ""minimized 6G kernel"" that provides shared capabilities such as native AI, spectrum sharing and security, and multiple ""6G subsystems"". The design comprises a suite of technologies covering disciplines such as the integration of AI and 6G, security architecture, spectrum sharing, mobile broadband and D2D protocols, improved low latency and reliability, the integration of communication and sensing, zero-power technology, and more. Compared to the ""scalable parameter sets + network slices"" approach to network resource allocation used in 5G, this new solution allows 6G to be better optimized for vertical applications.   Within this system, the minimized 6G kernel provides the underlying capabilities shared by all subsystems within the network. The AI capabilities integrated through 6G will help the network to efficiently deploy the different capabilities of the 6G subsystems to the corresponding vertical applications. By intelligently realizing on-demand networking and resource allocation, the networks will be able to meet the ever-changing connectivity needs of different applications. At the same time, the new security structure will require the establishment of a multi-party trust model and endogenous security with intelligent security to protect a wide range of service data. Finally, flexible spectrum management and sharing will use blockchain technology to simplify spectrum allocation and management and improve spectrum utilization efficiency.   To deal with the diverse demands of different applications on the networks, separate optimizations will be made for four different capabilities, including Clouding, Critical IoT, Ubiquitous IoT, and Sensing, with one or more subsystems designed for each of these capabilities. These subsystems can be combined and switched on-demand through AI to serve different industries and applications.   For example, the 6G non-terrestrial network subsystem can break constraints imposed by time, cost, or geography by introducing additional satellite communication capabilities into the 6G system. This can support broader network coverage to better serve applications that place higher requirements on coverage over high data rates. Another example is the 6G sensing subsystem, which integrates both communication and sensing technologies. Partial localization capabilities are already possible with 5G, however, with 6G, ubiquitous sensing functionality will be realized through the introduction of new sensing capabilities. By capturing every detail in the physical world, 6G networks will be able to support the construction of digital twins in the virtual world.   OPPO is leading the next generation of communication technology through its investment in 6G research   Current research into 6G technology is still in its infancy, and the industry as a whole is just beginning its exploration of this future technology. As a leader in the field, OPPO began its own initial research into 6G in 2019, beginning with research into new device form factors and new service requirements.   OPPO's key research directions for 6G include the integration of AI and wireless communications, zero-power communication technology, user-centric designs, the integration of communications and sensing, non-terrestrial networks, and terahertz/wireless optical communications. Through its participation in areas such as systems verification, technology research, and standardization, OPPO has already been driving the development of technologies related to its key 6G research interests. In terms of standardization, OPPO is also regularly involved with various standardization organizations around the world, including ITU, 3GPP, CCSA, IMT-2030 Promotion Group, and FuTURE Forum.   Going forward, OPPO will continue to work on bringing 5G to more users worldwide while continuing to explore how cutting-edge 6G technology can create a truly mobile world for global users.   At MWC23, OPPO will showcase its prototype devices for technology applications based on 6G communication. Please visit OPPO's booth in Hall 3, Stand 3M10, at the Fira Gran Via, Barcelona, from February 27 to March 2, 2023. For further details, please also refer to the  OPPO MWC23 official website.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820317,"Malik Beasley scores 25 points, Lakers beat Warriors 124-111","LOS ANGELES (AP) — LeBron James and Anthony Davis might finally have a supporting cast to help the Los Angeles Lakers make a push to get into the playoffs.

            Malik Beasley scored 25 points and was one of eight players in double figures as the new-look Lakers returned from the All-Star break to beat the Golden State Warriors 124-111 on Thursday night.

            Los Angeles (28-32) is 13th in the Western Conference but has won three of four since the trade deadline. They are 1 1/2 games out of a spot in the play-in tournament.











            Beasley, who was acquired from Utah as part of a three-team trade at the deadline, has two 20-point games in his four starts for the Lakers. 

            “LeBron and AD didn't get going as much as they wanted tonight, but we’re deep, and I think that’s the statement we want to make,” Beasley said. “It can be any player on any given night.”

            Beasley made seven 3-pointers on a night when the Lakers shot a season-bet 53.3% from beyond the arc (16 of 30) and collected a season-high 58 rebounds.

            It was a quiet night for Davis and James, who both saw under 30 minutes of action.

            James — who suffered a hand injury during the All-Star game Sunday night — had 13 points, nine rebounds and eight assists. But James was 5 of 20 from the floor, marking only the sixth time in his career he has shot 25% or worse when attempting at least 20 shots.

            “We're still figuring things out on the fly,"" said Davis, who had 12 points and 12 rebounds. ""The past two games we've really looked good as a whole. I think we've got a complete team where we're able to make a run.”

            Austin Reeves had 17 points off the bench, including 13 in the third quarter. The Lakers got a season-best 68 points from their reserves, including five in double figures.

            “Just overall great team win. Everybody contributed, everybody had different moments and guys stayed aggressive,” Lakers coach Darvin Ham said. “I feel great about what we’ve been able to do (since the trade deadline). It’s paying dividends right now and we've just got to continue to get more and more familiar with one another.”

            Klay Thompson led Golden State with 22 points and Ty Jerome added 20. The defending NBA champions are 29-30 and fell to 10th place in the Western Conference. 

            The Warriors are 9-12 this season without All-Star Stephen Curry. They have dropped four of six since Curry suffered a left leg injury on Feb. 4 against Dallas.

            “We were fouling, had some disjointed offensive possessions, some turnovers and some difficult shots that were basically shot/turnovers,” coach Steve Kerr said. “There were several key stretches where we had a chance to get back in the game but couldn’t put it together.”

            Golden State got to 59-58 early in the third quarter on a jumper by Thompson before the Lakers went on a 21-7 run.

            The Warriors countered by getting within eight before the Lakers broke it open again with a 26-6 spurt.

            TIP-INS

            Warriors: Jordan Poole had 16 points. ... Kevon Looney had 15 rebounds along with 10 points. He is the first Golden State player to have four straight games with at least 13 rebounds since Andrew Bogut in 2014.

            Lakers: Mo Bamba had a double-double off the bench (10 points, 13 rebounds) ... Rui Hachimura had 14 points and Dennis Schroder 13. ... D’Angelo Russell sprained his right ankle in the first quarter and did not return.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820321,Timme helps No. 12 Gonzaga rout San Diego 97-72,"SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) — Drew Timme had 22 points and 13 rebounds to help No. 12 Gonzaga beat San Diego 97-72 on Thursday night.

            The win sets up a matchup between Gonzaga and No. 15 Saint Mary’s for the West Coast Conference regular season title on Saturday. The Gaels haven’t won an outright WCC regular season title since 2011-12 and haven’t beat the Zags twice in a season since 2015-16.

            “It’s a much anticipated matchup. They got us last time and we’re hungry. It’s going to be a good environment but we’ve got to focus on the game plan and not get caught up in all that stuff,” said Ben Gregg, who had 18 points for the Zags. 











            Timme needs to average 19.3 points per game over the next three games to break Gonzaga’s all-time scoring record set by Frank Burgess in 1961.

            The Zags (23-6, 13-2 West Coast) dug out of an early six-point deficit with a 19-2 run before Jase Townsend took over for USD, scoring on an array of jumpers and drives to keep the margin in single digits. Not to be outdueled, Gregg reeled off 11 points in the last 4:35 of the first half as part of a 17-7 Gonzaga run to close the half up 17.

            “We watched San Diego take Saint Mary’s down to the wire there last week and knew they had some really talented offensive players,” said Gonzaga head coach Mark Few. “I thought we did a nice job of handling their mixing defenses.”

            Julian Strawther scored 17. Gonzaga is 16-0 this season when Strawther scores at least 14 points and have won 146 straight games when ahead by 10 or more at the half.

            Timme and Bolton scored or assisted on 10 straight points to start the second for Gonzaga, igniting a 17-6 run to push the Zags’ lead to 30.

            The Toreros (11-18, 4-11) couldn’t contain the Zags’ No. 1 scoring offense after holding No. 15 Saint Mary’s scoreless over the final 7:05 of a 62-59 home loss last week. San Diego closed the game with a 12-2 run.

            Townsend scored 15 points and Marcellus Earlington added 11 in his return to the starting lineup after sitting out against Saint Mary’s due to injury.

            “They’re a rhythm team offensively, so our first priority was to execute well enough offensively to set our defense so they wouldn’t get into that rhythm … then they went on those runs and never looked back,” said San Diego head coach Steve Lavin.

            BIG PICTURE

            Gonzaga is on a four-game win streak after an eight-point setback to Saint Mary’s. With a win, the Zags claim a share of the WCC regular season title for the 11th straight season. The Toreros have sole possession of second-to-last place in the WCC with one home game remaining and have lost 15 straight to Gonzaga. USD has lost four straight and six of its last seven.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820322,"As Ukraine marks year of war, leader vows to secure victory","KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine’s leader pledged Friday to push for victory in 2023 as he and other Ukrainians marked the somber anniversary of the Russian invasion that upended their lives and Europe's security. 

            It was Ukraine's ""longest day,"" President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said, but the country's dogged resistance a year on has proven that ""every tomorrow is worth fighting for.”

            On a day of commemorations, reflection and tears, the Ukrainian president's defiant tone captured the national mood of resilience in the face of Europe’s biggest and deadliest war since World War II. Zelenskyy, who has himself become a symbol of Ukraine's refusal to bow to Moscow, said Ukrainians proved themselves to be invincible during ""a year of pain, sorrow, faith and unity.”











            “We have been standing for exactly one year,” Zelenskyy said. Feb. 24, 2022, he said, was ""the longest day of our lives. The hardest day of our modern history. We woke up early and haven’t fallen asleep since.”

            Ukrainians wept at memorials for their tens of thousands of dead — a toll growing inexorably as fighting rages in eastern Ukraine in particular. Although Friday marked the anniversary of the full-scale invasion, combat between Russian-backed forces and Ukrainian troops has raged in the country’s east since 2014. New video from there shot with a drone for The Associated Press showed how the town of Marinka has been razed, along with others. 

            The killing continued: Russian shelling killed another three civilians and wounded 19 others in the most recent 24-hour spell, Ukraine’s presidential office said. 

            Around the country, Ukrainians looked back at a year that changed their lives and at the clouded future.

            “I can sum up the last year in three words: Fear, love, hope,"" Oleksandr Hranyk, a school director in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, said.

            Lining up in the capital, Kyiv, to buy anniversary commemorative postage stamps, Tetiana Klimkova described her heart as ""falling and hurting.” 

            Still, “this day has become a symbol for me that we have survived for a whole year and will continue to live,” she said. “On this day, our children and grandchildren will remember how strong Ukrainians are mentally, physically, and spiritually.” 

            Although China on Friday called for a cease-fire, peace was nowhere in sight. Ukraine previously rejected a pause in the fighting for fear it would allow Russia to regroup militarily after bruising battlefield setbacks. 

            Zelenskyy gave qualified support to China’s apparent new interest in playing a diplomatic role, saying: “The fact that China started talking about Ukraine is not bad.” 

            “But the question is what follows the words,"" he said during a wide-ranging news conference. ""The question is in the steps and where they will lead to.”

            A 12-point paper issued by China’s Foreign Ministry also urged an end to sanctions that aim to squeeze Russia's economy. 

            That suggestion also looked like a non-starter, given that Western nations are working to further tighten the sanctions noose, not loosen it. Both the U.K. and U.S. imposed more sanctions Friday.

            Ukraine is readying another military push to roll back Russian forces with the help of weaponry that has poured in from the West. NATO member Poland said Friday that it had delivered four advanced Leopard 2A4 tanks, making it the first country to hand the German-made armor to Ukraine. 

            The prime minister of Poland said on a visit to Kyiv that more Leopards are coming. Poland's defense minister said contributions from other countries would help form Ukraine's first Leopard battalion of 31 tanks.

            “Ukraine is entering a new period, with a new task — to win,” Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov said. 

            “It will not be easy. But we will manage,” he added. “There is rage and a desire to avenge the fallen.” 

            Air raid alarms didn't sound Friday in Kyiv, alleviating concerns that Russia might unleash another barrage of missiles to pile yet more sadness on Ukraine on the anniversary. 

            Still, the government recommended that schools move classes online, and office employees were asked to work from home. And even as they rode Kyiv’s subway to work, bought coffee and got busy, Ukrainians were unavoidably haunted by thoughts of loss and memories of when missiles struck, troops rolled across Ukraine’s borders and a refugee exodus began a year ago. 

            Back then, there were fears the country might fall within weeks. Zelenskyy referred to those dark moments in a video address.

            “We fiercely fought for every day. And we endured the second day. And then, the third,” he said. ""And we still know: Every tomorrow is worth fighting for.”

            The anniversary was also poignant for the parents of children born exactly a year ago as bombs began killing and maiming. 

            “It’s a tragedy for the whole country, for every Ukrainian,” said Alina Mustafaieva, who gave birth to daughter Yeva that day.

            ""My family was lucky. We didn’t lose anyone or anything. But many did, and we have to share this loss together,"" she said.

            Tributes to Ukraine’s resilience took place in other countries. The Eiffel Tower in Paris and the Colosseum in Rome were among monuments illuminated in Ukraine's colors — yellow and blue. In Berlin, a wrecked Russian tank was put on display. 

            Anti-war activists in Belgrade, Serbia, left a cake covered with red icing representing blood and a skull on top on a pavement near the Russian Embassy, which police stopped them from approaching. 

            In Russia, media and rights groups reported more police arrests of protesters who took to streets with antiwar slogans and flowers in various parts of the country.

            The war's one-year mark kept Ukraine's president exceptionally busy. Zelenskyy kicked off the day with an early morning tweet that promised: “We know that 2023 will be the year of our victory!” 

            He followed that up with his video address, in which he also pledged not to abandon Ukrainians living under Russian occupation. “One way or another, we will liberate all our lands,” he vowed. He also addressed troops on a Kyiv square and handed out honors, including to the widow and daughter of a fallen soldier, telling them: “We will never forget.” In a Kyiv hospital, he decorated wounded fighters.

            Unable to fly by plane from Ukraine while its airspace is closed because of the war, Zelenskyy did the next best thing at his news conference, spending nearly 2 1/2 hours with journalists from around the world. He thanked country after country for its support. 

            Emotional at times and playful at others, the president offered a glimpse of the people-skills he has used in corralling world leaders to back him and his country's cause. He pushed again for more Western weaponry, including combat aircraft flown by the Royal Air Force in Britain that its government, led by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, isn't for the moment willing to send.

            “Where (are) our aircraft, Typhoon?"" Zelenskyy said, switching to speaking in English. “Please ask my friend Rishi.” 

            The news conference was televised live, which was unusual. Generally during the war, Zelenskyy's speeches and comments are broadcast with a delay until he has left a location, to protect him from a possible attack.

            Zelenskyy argued that Ukraine cannot negotiate with Russia while its aggression continues. “Leave our territory. Stop bombing us,” he said. He also argued that Russian President Vladimir Putin should be held responsible for war crimes. 

            “This is not a child who broke something and can be forgiven,"" he said.

            Zelenskyy said one of his biggest disappointments in the invasion was seeing people who could have fought leave the country, a reference to officials who fled. He said a low point was when Russian atrocities were discovered in the recaptured town of Bucha near Kyiv. 

            “It was very scary,” he said. “We saw that the devil is not somewhere out there, but on Earth.”

            A year on, casualty figures are horrific on both sides, although Moscow and Kyiv keep precise numbers under wraps. Western estimates suggest hundreds of thousands of killed and wounded. 

            In Kharkiv, Ukrainian serviceman Dmytro Kovalenko was buried Friday in the city's main cemetery for soldiers, which has added 15 new rows of graves this past year. Kovalenko was killed Monday in the fiercely contested eastern city of Bakhmut. Those saying final goodbyes included Andrii Zatsorenko, a friend who lay red carnations on the grave.

            “I never thought I’d be giving him flowers,” Zatsorenko said.

            “The war will not end soon,” he added. “We have a powerful enemy.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820326,"Snow, rain slam California as Michigan suffers without power","LOS ANGELES (AP) — Heavy snow and rain pounded California and other parts of the West on Friday in the nation's latest winter storm, while tens of thousands of people in Michigan suffered in freezing temperatures days after one of the worst ice storms in decades caused widespread power outages.

            Days of winter storms blacked out nearly 1 million homes and businesses from coast to coast, closed major roads, caused pileups on highways and snarled air travel. More than 460 flights were canceled and more than 7,400 were delayed Friday across the U.S., according to FlightAware.com.

            In California, the National Weather Service warned of cold, snowy and rainy weather lasting through Saturday and issued flash flood warnings through 10 p.m. Friday for Los Angeles, its suburbs and a portion of Ventura County, a region that is home to about 6 million people.











            Cellphones buzzed Friday afternoon with an emergency alert that warned: “This is a dangerous and life-threatening situation. Do not attempt to travel unless you are fleeing an area subject to flooding.”

            Some places in the flash flood warning zone could see up to 10 inches (23 centimeters) of rain, the weather service said.

            Authorities warned that heavy rainfall could cause debris flow in some areas burned by wildfires in recent years. Evacuation warnings were issued for some areas, with residents urged to be ready to flee at a moment's notice.

            Blizzard warnings were posted in the Sierra Nevada and Southern California mountain ranges, where as much as 5 feet (1.5 meters) of snow was expected. Temperatures could drop far below normal in the region, posing a special risk to homeless people.

            “Simply put, this will be a historic event for the amount of snow over the higher peaks and lower elevation snow,” according to the regional weather office.

            Interstate 5, the West Coast’s major north-south highway, was closed south of the Oregon border as snow fell to the floor of the Sacramento Valley. A high mountain pass north of Los Angeles also was closed for hours before finally reopening late Friday, although traffic was creeping along with a police escort.

            In Michigan, hundreds of thousands of people remained without power Friday after a storm earlier this week coated power lines, utility poles and branches with ice as thick as three-quarters of an inch (1.9 centimeters). Gov. Gretchen Whitmer called Friday for more accountability on restoration efforts by the state’s two largest utilities.

            Annemarie Rogers had been without power for a day and a half in Grosse Pointe Farms, Michigan. She sent two kids to stay with relatives and put extra blankets on the bed to try to keep warm. 

            “It’s kind of miserable,” she said. “We do have a gas fireplace that’s keeping us warm in one room. There’s some heat generating from the furnace, but with no electricity to the blower, it’s not circulating well.""

            At one point, more than 820,000 customers in Michigan were in the dark. By Friday, that was down to under 600,000, most in the state's populous southeastern corner around Detroit. But promises of power restoration by Sunday, when low temperatures were expected to climb back above zero (minus 18 Celsius), were of little consolation.

            “That’s four days without power in such weather,"" said Apurva Gokhale, of Walled Lake, Michigan. ""It’s unthinkable.”

            Tom Rankin said he and his wife were unable to reach his 100-year-old mother-in-law Friday morning by phone. The couple drove to her home in Bloomfield Township, Michigan, to find her in bed “with a whole lot of blankets,” Rankin said, adding they helped her to their car, planning to ride out the outage at another relative’s home.

            “We’ve not had an ice storm in the last 50 years that has impacted our infrastructure like this,” said Trevor Lauer, president of Detroit-based DTE Electric.

            At least three people have died in the storms. A Michigan firefighter died Wednesday after coming in contact with a downed power line, while in Rochester, Minnesota, a pedestrian died after being hit by a city-operated snowplow. Authorities in Portland, Oregon, said a person died of hyperthermia. 

            Much of Portland was shut down with icy roads not expected to thaw until Saturday after the city’s second-heaviest snowfall on record this week — nearly 11 inches (28 centimeters). 

            Tim Varner sat huddled with blankets in a Portland storefront doorway that shielded him from some of the wind, ice and snow. Local officials opened six overnight shelters but the 57-year-old, who has been homeless for two decades, said it was too hard to push a shopping cart containing his belongings to get to one.

            “It’s impossible,” he said. “The snow gets built up on the wheels of your cart, and then you find slippery spots and can’t get no traction. So you’re stuck.”

            In Northern California, snow piled up across Santa Cruz County as roads closed and motorists were forced to abandon their cars.

            Not all were dismayed by the winter weather. In the San Francisco Bay Area, hundreds of people drove up to 2,500-foot (760-meter) Mount Tamalpais to play in the snow — a rarity in the area.

            San Francisco resident Shankar Krishnan woke up at 4 a.m. and headed out hoping to see snow for the first time in a long time.

            “It feels awesome. It’s like the trees are all frosty. There’s snow on the ground. There’s snow coming down from the sky,"" Krishnan said. ""It’s beautiful out here.”

            Some schools in Nevada and northern Arizona were closed, and a Major League Soccer season-opening game in Southern California was postponed.

            The storm has added to major precipitation from December and January “atmospheric rivers” that improved California’s drought outlook, but authorities who allocate water to farms, cities and industries remain cautious because of a recent history of abrupt changes in hydrologic conditions. ___

The couple drove to her home in Bloomfield Township, Michigan, to find her in bed “with a whole lot of blankets,” Rankin said, adding they helped her to their car, planning to ride out the outage at another relative’s home.“We’ve not had an ice storm in the last 50 years that has impacted our infrastructure like this,” said Trevor Lauer, president of Detroit-based DTE Electric.At least three people have died in the storms. A Michigan firefighter died Wednesday after coming in contact with a downed power line, while in Rochester, Minnesota, a pedestrian died after being hit by a city-operated snowplow. Authorities in Portland, Oregon, said a person died of hyperthermia.Much of Portland was shut down with icy roads not expected to thaw until Saturday after the city’s second-heaviest snowfall on record this week — nearly 11 inches (28 centimeters).Tim Varner sat huddled with blankets in a Portland storefront doorway that shielded him from some of the wind, ice and snow. Local officials opened six overnight shelters but the 57-year-old, who has been homeless for two decades, said it was too hard to push a shopping cart containing his belongings to get to one.“It’s impossible,” he said. “The snow gets built up on the wheels of your cart, and then you find slippery spots and can’t get no traction. So you’re stuck.”In Northern California, snow piled up across Santa Cruz County as roads closed and motorists were forced to abandon their cars.Not all were dismayed by the winter weather. In the San Francisco Bay Area, hundreds of people drove up to 2,500-foot (760-meter) Mount Tamalpais to play in the snow — a rarity in the area.San Francisco resident Shankar Krishnan woke up at 4 a.m. and headed out hoping to see snow for the first time in a long time.“It feels awesome. It’s like the trees are all frosty. There’s snow on the ground. There’s snow coming down from the sky,"" Krishnan said. ""It’s beautiful out here.”Some schools in Nevada and northern Arizona were closed, and a Major League Soccer season-opening game in Southern California was postponed.The storm has added to major precipitation from December and January “atmospheric rivers” that improved California’s drought outlook, but authorities who allocate water to farms, cities and industries remain cautious because of a recent history of abrupt changes in hydrologic conditions. ___This story has been updated to correct the number of flights canceled and delayed across the U.S. A previous story used global figures instead of U.S. figures.___Taxin reported from Orange County, California, and White from Detroit.

There is a growing preference for cats, with only Hualien, Taitung, Pingtung, Chiayi, and Tainan recording more registrations of dogs last year, wrote Liberty Times, citing the Ministry of Finance.Pet-related businesses grew from 6,486 in 2018 to 8,335 in 2022, representing 30% growth. Sales skyrocketed from NT$26.6 billion (US$870 million) to NT$38.7 billion during the same period, mostly centered on merchandise involved in the various aspects of raising a furry companion.The sources of food for dogs and cats also vary. Nearly 50% of cat products available are imported, while only 30% of dog foods are introduced from abroad.Taiwan is seeing a trend where people are growing more fond of keeping a pet rather than rearing a child. In a Ministry of the Interior report last year, the country added 170,000 registered pets in the first nine months, when newborns in the same period were estimated at less than 140,000, per Upmedia.The country had a population of 23.3 million as of January.

When asked by the media on Friday to comment on this assertion, Chiu said Taiwan's armed forces will ""fight to the end.""Chiu also said the military has evaluated the enemy's capabilities. He said that no matter how fast the CCP wants to go, it must overcome the massive hurdle that is the Taiwan Strait.In an interview with Commonwealth Magazine published on Tuesday (Feb. 21), Chieh said the CCP will avoid Russia's mistake of underestimating the enemy, and it will seek to end the war with Taiwan quickly. Therefore, from the start, Chieh reasoned the assault on Taiwan would probably be bigger than what was seen in Ukraine, ""but not so big that it could take Taiwan in a week or two.""When asked on Friday to comment on Chieh's theory that Taiwan could hold out for two weeks, Chiu said: ""It's not just two weeks, I'm talking about fighting to the end."" The defense minister said that the CCP seems to think it will be able to win a war with Taiwan in a short period of time ""but this prediction is too optimistic.""Chiu said: ""No matter how fast they go, they must pass through the natural dangers of the Taiwan Strait.

Germany 'stands firmly' with Ukraine — Scholz

            German Chancellor Olaf Scholz expressed confidence that Russian President Vladimir Putin would not achieve what he set out to when his forces invaded Ukraine one year ago.

            ""Germany stands firmly by the side of Ukraine,"" Scholz said in a recorded message posted on social media, and stressed ""The sooner Putin realizes that he will no achieve his imperialist goal, the greater the chance of an end to the war.""

DW correspondent shares personal experiences from the war in Ukraine

            DW's Max Zander has reported from Ukraine during the course of the Russian invasion and shared some of his observations with DW TV's Sarah Kelly.

            ""The first time I went to Ukraine, for me what really stood out was, just two train rides away from Berlin you can see all this destruction, you can really see what the war actually does in terms of destroyed buildings, destroyed bridges, that kind of infrastructure,"" Zander said.

            Zander said that in Kyiv, a semblance of normality had returned, but once a person left the capital and went to the outskirts of the city and saw the places like Bucha and Hostomel, ""you can really see what the war did to these locations and to the people living there.""

            Zander said what stood out for him was the experience of the Ukrainian people.

            ""Ukrainians that are fighting every day, the experience of the Ukrainians that are going through so much and showing so much resilience.""

            ""Not a white flag, but the blue and yellow one. Not fleeing but facing. Resisting and fighting,"" Zelenskyy said in a tweet posted with a video showing snapshots of the trauma Ukrainians have faced, but also the staunch level of resistance.

Today, I see a lot of people just actually headed to work and traffic is building up, because a lot of people have moved back to the capital.""

            Facsar said that some Ukrainians living in the capital didn't want to be constantly reminded of the anniversary because of the blood that has been shed in so many parts of the country.

            ""People are nervous today, but its not like it was a year ago,"" Facsar said.

Destroyed Russian tank displayed in front of embassy in Berlin

            A destroyed T-72 was parked opposite the Russian Embassy in Berlin to mark a year since President Vladimir Putin's military invaded Ukraine.

            The Russian tank was brought from Ukraine through Poland on the back of a flatbed truck by the German Story Bunker museum.

            ""We want to put their junk back in front of the terrorists. They have murdered, looted, displaced millions of people, and they just keep going every day,"" Wieland Giebel curator at the museum, said.

            An anti-tank mine destroyed the tank in the first days of the war in the Battle of Kyiv near the village of Dmytrivka, near Bucha.

            The museum first proposed the idea in June last year but had to fight a court battle to get clearance. 

            It will be outside the embassy throughout the weekend.
UN approves resolution calling for Russia to leave Ukraine

            A vast majority of UN General Assembly members on Thursday voted in favor of a motion put forward by Germany calling for peace in Ukraine as soon as possible.

            There were 141 votes in favor and 32 abstentions. Six countries joined Russia to vote no - Belarus, North Korea, Eritrea, Mali, Nicaragua, and Syria.

            The resolution calls for Russia to end hostilities in Ukraine and withdraw its forces.

            General Assembly resolutions are not binding and carry mainly symbolic weight at the United Nations. However, unlike the Security Council, Russia cannot unilaterally veto them.

            Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said the vote was more evidence that not only the West backs his country.

            ""This vote defies the argument that the global south does not stand on Ukraine's side,"" Kuleba said. ""Many countries representing Latin America, Africa, Asia voted in favor.""

It is slated to reach the orbiting lab and dock with the International Space Station on Sunday.However, it is not going to bring back the three astronauts — US astronaut Frank Rubio and Russian cosmonauts Dmitry Petelin and Sergei Prokopyev until September.The three astronauts reached the ISS last September and their mission was supposed to last for six months but it was prolonged because their return vehicle started leaking coolant in December. The reason for the leak as believed by US and Russian space officials was a micrometeorite that damaged an external radiator.A similar leak was reported in a Russian cargo ship docked to the ISS since October. That uncrewed cargo ship was released from the space station last week.Fearing manufacturing defects, the Russian Space Agency had delayed the launch of the new rescue capsule.The rescue capsule was scheduled for launch in March and was going to have two cosmonauts and an astronaut on board to replace Rubio, Petelin, and Prokopyev.However, without replacements, the three will now be spending close to a year on the ISS. They will only make their return to Earth once a new capsule, with crew replacements, is ready for launch in September.Once humans reach the ISS, capsules remain attached to the orbiting research lab for the entire duration of missions, to bring back astronauts to Earth upon completion of their missions.The damaged capsule will return to Earth empty so that engineers can examine it.mf/rc (AP/AFP)",2023/02/24,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820349,How Russia's Ukraine invasion impacted southeastern Europe,"Russia's invasion of Ukraine has had a direct impact on its immediate neighbors, turning them overnight into host countries or transit countries for refugees. Three million Ukrainians fled to Romania alone, with 100,000 settling there.But Bulgaria and Greece, which are both further afield, have also been affected by Russia's aggression. They have also taken in refugees or — in the case of Bulgaria — supplied Ukraine with armaments.Only Hungary, whose prime minister, Viktor Orban, is a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin and only reluctantly supports the EU's sanctions against Russia, is steering a very different course.Our correspondents take a closer look at how these four countries have been affected by the events of the past year.Not since World War II were people in Romania as scared as they were in the early hours of February 24, 2022, when the Russian invasion of Ukraine began. Many asked themselves what they would do if Russia attacked Romania.""The military and the intelligence services responded quickly and well,"" Romanian military expert Claudiu Degeratu told DW. Since then, the country's defense budget has been increased and a program of military modernization launched. Degeratu says that immediate investment in the domestic arms industry is now necessary. NATO has also ramped up its presence in Romania.Because Romania is not heavily reliant on Russian gas and because it had few financial dealings with Russia, it is not as exposed as other EU member states, business journalist Stelian Muscalu told DW.According to Muscalu, Romania's macroeconomic indicators have remained largely unchanged. In contrast, people are more afraid, which has lowered hopes of an economic upswing after the COVID-19 pandemic. ""The rapid rise in inflation because of energy prices and poor economic management has reduced people's incomes and living standards,"" said Muscalu.During the grain crisis caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Romania assumed a key role by facilitating the export of Ukrainian grain via its Black Sea port of Constanta. In contrast, ships carrying Ukrainian grain often remain docked in the port of Istanbul for up to 50 days because Russia has the right to check their cargo.Officially, the Bulgarian government has not to date sent either ammunition or weapons directly to Ukraine. On the face of it, this is not surprising given Bulgaria's traditionally pro-Russian stance. But nothing is as it seems: In reality, NATO member Bulgaria is one of the most important suppliers of armaments to Ukraine.The government of pro-Western reformer Kiril Petkov, which was in office for only eight months, supplied Ukraine with both ammunition and diesel from April to August 2022. It is estimated that about 30% of the ammunition and up to 40% of the fuel needed for the Ukrainian army's tanks and vehicles came from Bulgaria.This is even more remarkable considering that Bulgaria, which relies heavily on energy supplies from Russia, was one of the first countries to have its gas supplies cut by Russia last April. Giving away diesel at a time like this was a bold move.It was equally bold to risk angering those in the country that sympathize with Russia. Then as now, one of Petkov's former coalition partners, the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), and President Rumen Radev were deeply opposed to military aid for Ukraine and sanctions against Russia.To preserve the coalition peace and out of consideration for pro-Russian sentiment in the country, the government never spoke openly about supplying Ukraine. While these supplies increased Petkov's standing at international level, they remain controversial in Bulgaria.President Radev publicly condemns the Russian invasion but is otherwise opposed to anything that counters Russia's interests. Although a parliamentary majority voted in late 2022 in favor of direct military aid for Ukraine after Petkov's government was ousted, the interim government appointed by President Radev has so far made no real effort to implement the decision.Although direct support for Putin and his war is declining in Bulgaria, polls show that pro-Western parties will not get a majority in the upcoming elections in April 2023.Just days before the anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Hungary's PM Viktor Orban once again lived up to his reputation as ""Putin's extended arm"" in the EU. There was not a single word of solidarity with Ukraine in his annual state of the nation address in Budapest on February 18.Instead, he accused the West of supporting the war and behaving like ""sleepwalkers on a roof"", drifting towards a new world war. He called for an end to sanctions against Moscow, good economic relations between the entire West and Russia and ""peace negotiations between Americans and Russians.""Once again, Orban was not afraid to court controversy. He compared Germany's decision to supply Ukraine with tanks to Hitler's military campaign against the former Soviet Union, saying ""In a few weeks, Leopard tanks will be rolling through Ukrainian territory to the east, to the Russian border. Maybe they'll even have the old maps in them.""To date, Hungary's PM has not been able to bring himself to unconditionally condemn Russia's aggression against Ukraine. Instead, his remarks on Ukraine have repeatedly caused a stir. At the end of January, Orban described Ukraine as ""no man's land."" Kyiv strongly condemned the remarks and summoned the Hungarian ambassador.While Orban's stance can ostensibly be explained by Hungary's heavy dependence on Russian energy supplies, it is increasing his country's political isolation within Europe. When Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy attended an EU summit in Brussels on February 9, he was greeted with a round of applause by the heads of state assembled for the traditional ""family photo."" The only one who didn't clap was Viktor Orban.""I'm just trying to be happy,"" refugee Nina Plechak-Paskal told DW. When Putin's army took Crimea, and pro-Russian, Moscow-controlled groups occupied her native Donetsk in 2014, she fled to the Ukrainian capital. ""I had to start over from zero in Kyiv,"" she recalls. Then, when Russia invaded Ukraine a year ago, she fled again, this time to Thessaloniki.Nina is a member of Ukraine's 90,000-strong Greek minority. The fact that she speaks Greek makes things much easier for her in her host country. She was able to keep her job in a logistics company in Ukraine and now works online from Greece. Her 15-year-old daughter attends an international school in Greece during the day and online classes from her Ukrainian school in the evening.Because Orthodox Christianity is the dominant religion in both countries, many Ukrainians feel at home in Greece. Nevertheless, that doesn't necessarily make life any easier: ""When you live here, it's not a holiday in the sun. Many things are very complicated,"" says Plechak-Paskal. ""Without the language, it's hard to get papers. Most officials only speak Greek.""Over 100,000 Ukrainians crossed into Greece since Russia invaded Ukraine, according to the Ukrainian General Consulate in Thessaloniki. They enjoy temporary protected status, which means that they don't have to apply for asylum straight away and get a residence permit much more easily than refugees from other countries.Nevertheless, the situation for many refugees is not easy, says Vadim Sabuk, consulate general of Ukraine. ""Many people who came here have since moved on to other countries where they get more financial assistance."" This is why there are now only about 22,000 Ukrainians in Greece.Adapted from the German by Aingeal Flanagan",2023/02/23,,

            The win avenged Boston’s first regulation home loss of the season, which was a 3-0 defeat to Seattle back on Jan. 12, still the only time Boston has been shut out this year.

            Seattle’s Matty Beniers scored just 40 seconds into the game, and the teams went back and forth the rest of the way.











            Jaden Schwartz put Seattle ahead 5-4 at 15:50 of the third period. Brandon Carlo tied it less than 30 seconds later.

            DeBrusk scored the winning goal at 18:22, with an assist from Charlie McAvoy.

            “It was a good shift by our line,” DeBrusk said. “(Marchand) won a puck battle, (Patrice Bergeron) won a puck battle, he got up to the point, and I just tried to get to the net.""

            “It’s simple hockey, honestly, but it seems like it’s been going that way as of late,” he said. ""It's always fun to score those goals, everyone wants to be a part of it, but I think the goals leading up to it were equally as clutch to get us in that position.”

            The two teams combined for 74 shots on goal. Boston’s Jeremy Swayman made 36 saves for the Bruins and Phillip Grubauer finished with 27 for Seattle.

            “It was a great hockey game,” Boston coach Jim Montgomery said. “It really was. To me, both teams made mistakes defensively, I know we made several, but when teams are executing supporting pucks and playing well offensively, it just makes for a great brand of hockey.”

            With the win, the Bruins improved to 44-8-5.

            “We have a ton of experience,” said Brad Marchand, who scored for Boston. “We have an older group, which I don’t think you can ever discount. I know a lot of teams are going younger and stuff now, but the experience, you can never have enough of it. I think it shows through in times where there is a lot of intensity and pressure.”

            Bergeron put Boston ahead 4-3 at 17:51 of the second period. Yanni Gourde tied it on the power play at 18:52.

            David Krejci, David Pastrnak and Marchand also scored for the Bruins.

            Vince Dunn and Jamie Oleksiak scored for Seattle.

            “The compete level was outstanding all the way through the game,” Seattle coach Dave Hakstol said. “There was a lot of intensity in the game, there was pace, obviously a lot of back and forth, especially during the second period and then late in the hockey game.”

            NOTES: Boston acquired defenseman Dmitry Orlov and forward Garnet Hathaway from Washington in a three-team trade Thursday for forward Craig Smith and a trio of draft picks, also acquired the rights to Russian forward prospect Andrei Svetlakov from Minnesota. … Seattle put goaltender Chris Driedger on waivers.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820352,States seek ways to curb deadly highway wrong-way crashes,"BOSTON (AP) — As Connecticut state Rep. Quentin Williams was driving home from the governor's inauguration ball last month, he was struck head-on by a driver who had entered the highway using a ramp going in the wrong direction, killing both Williams and the driver.

            
                Williams' death threw a spotlight on a kind of car accident that is particularly deadly: wrong-way crashes. Each year in the United States, they result in 400 to 500 deaths according to federal highway administrators.

            “He was the life of every party. He had an infectious happiness about him. He knew everybody and if he didn’t, he would find a way to know them,” said state Sen. Matthew Lesser, a fellow Democrat who described Williams as one of his closest friends. “He was a rising star in the Legislature with an incredible future in front of him and the next minute he was taken away from us.""











            Connecticut is seeking to join a growing number of states, including Massachusetts, trying to curb the frequency of deadly wrong-way highway collisions by turning to new crash prevention technologies.

            A $2.6 million pilot program in Massachusetts seeks to discourage wayward drivers by installing wrong-way vehicle detection systems at highway ramps. 

            When the system detects a car entering a ramp in the wrong direction it sets off flashing lights, signs and, at some locations, audible alarms to alert the driver. 

            “It gives you an opportunity to hit the brakes, realize you’ve gone in the wrong direction and turn around,"" said Massachusetts Highway Administrator Jonathan Gulliver.

            If the driver continues despite the warning system, state police receive a notice of a possible wrong-way driver. The highway operations center is also notified so they can immediately activate message boards on the roadway to let other motorists know someone might be driving in the wrong direction toward them.

            In Massachusetts, around 30 fatalities have been attributed to wrong-way vehicle crashes since 2014, officials said. 

            Gulliver said the state is drawing in part on wrong-way detection initiatives in other states, including Texas and Rhode Island.

            Older drivers, younger inexperienced drivers and impaired drivers — including those under the influence of alcohol — tend to be more at risk of initiating wrong-way crashes, according to researchers.

            Most wrong-way crashes that result in a fatality occur at night, when it’s harder to see signs. A disproportionate number also happen on the weekend, which could coincide with increased alcohol consumption.

            “When wrong-way driver crashes happen they generally lead to fatalities. They are some of the most deadly crashes we have, especially when they’re on the interstates involving high speed,” Gulliver said.

            Last July, a crash involving a wrong-way car on an interstate in northern Illinois left seven people dead, including five children. In November, five people, including two children, were killed in Alabama when their car entered the highway going the wrong way and hit an 18-wheeler.

            At least a handful of states have launched programs to address these types of crashes.

            Last year, Kentucky received a $5 million federal grant to help prevent wrong-way crashes on interstates. And in 2017, Arizona announced what it called a first-in-the-nation pilot program to use thermal camera technology to address wrong-way driving problems.

            Connecticut last year touted a $20 million program intended to install cameras on wrong-way signs across the state that would trigger flashing lights when a wrong-way driver is detected after these types of crashes led to nearly two dozen deaths in 2022 — a dramatic spike from earlier years.

            Several bills have been filed to expand that program.

            “It’s one thing to know that in the abstract, it’s another to have a close friend killed,” Lesser said of the sharp increase in accidents. “It can’t but light a fire under my colleagues to explore policy solutions.” 

            The Massachusetts system, which is funded through a mix of state and federal dollars, has so far been set up at 10 locations with another six next in line as part of the pilot program. 

            Initially, the pilot program was intended to be a multi-year effort, but the system has proven so successful officials said the state will work to expand it quickly, Gulliver said.

            Since the first warning systems were set up in November, the state has recorded 22 alarms, resulting in several drivers self-correcting, according to officials. 

            Massachusetts faces additional challenges because it's a densely populated state with older road systems that can sometimes be confusing to local drivers and visitors.

            Gulliver said that over the years, the state has taken steps to reduce that confusion and the wrong-way program will further aid motorists.BOSTON (AP) — As Connecticut state Rep.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820353,MacDowell artist retreat org taps Chiwoniso Kaitano to lead,"NEW YORK (AP) — MacDowell, one of the oldest artist residency programs in the U.S., has tapped Chiwoniso Kaitano as its new executive director, the organization announced Friday.

            Kaitano joins MacDowell with a mandate to “intensify outreach to traditionally underrepresented artistic voices,” among other charges, a release said.

            “Our search was rigorous, all our finalists compelling. But Chi’s expertise, energetic and collaborative methods of engagement, and inspiring leadership qualities proved irresistible,” author Nell Painter, the chair of MacDowell's board, said in the statement.











            Kaitano is the former executive director of Girl Be Heard, a nongovernmental organization that uses theater and the performing arts to advocate for social change. Originally from Zimbabwe, she also serves on the boards of several arts organizations.

            The prestigious MacDowell retreat is based in Peterborough, New Hampshire, where David Macy serves as resident director. Kaitano will work from the organization's New York office when she joins in mid-March. She will take over from transitional leader Philip Himberg.

            In the wake of the 2020 protests spurred by the police killing of George Floyd, MacDowell shed “Colony” from its name in response to feedback from fellows and artistic communities.

            “In the language we speak today, colony is a word tied to occupation and oppression,” Painter told The Associated Press at the time. A statement from the organization said the name change was “in keeping with the organization’s longstanding commitment to eliminate financial, geographic, cultural and accessibility barriers to participation.”

            Friday's statement referenced the shift in announcing Kaitano's appointment.

            “This change in MacDowell’s leadership follows an intense period of inquiry and innovation throughout the pandemic and recent social justice movements,” said board president Andrew M. Senchak. “During which time, MacDowell dropped ‘Colony’ from its name and the staff and board worked with external consultants to examine our values and our governance, to strengthen and democratize our policies, procedures, and program.”

            The retreat was founded in 1907 by composer Edward MacDowell and the musician and philanthropist Marian MacDowell and has played host to more than 8,800 fellows across seven disciplines: writing, architecture, composition, film, theater, visual art, and interdisciplinary art.

            “I look forward to working with the board and staff to sustain and grow funding and to build upon the extraordinary vision for artist support that Edward and Marian MacDowell articulated when they welcomed the first artists-in-residence,” Kaitano said in the statement. “Imagining and joyfully meeting the ever-evolving needs of contemporary artists is how MacDowell can and will continue to be a pioneering champion for the value of the arts in our society.""NEW YORK (AP) — MacDowell, one of the oldest artist residency programs in the U.S., has tapped Chiwoniso Kaitano as its new executive director, the organization announced Friday.Kaitano joins MacDowell with a mandate to “intensify outreach to traditionally underrepresented artistic voices,” among other charges, a release said.“Our search was rigorous, all our finalists compelling.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820354,"Granlund and Niederreiter both score 2, Preds top Sharks 6-2","SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — Mikael Granlund and Nino Niederreiter each scored twice, and the Nashville Predators beat the San Jose Sharks 6-2 on Thursday night.

            Granlund has nine goals this season. Niederreiter extended his goal streak to three games. Yakov Trenin and Tommy Novak also scored for Nashville. 

            Matt Duchene had three assists, and Juuse Saros made 22 saves for his 22nd win of the season.











            “Throughout the night, the whole 60 minutes, we were pretty solid,"" Granlund said. ""We were creating chances and playing hard. So I mean, just a really good team effort and it was a fun game to play.”

            Nico Sturm got his 11th goal and Martin Kaut scored his first for the Sharks. James Reimer made 24 saves.

            “Pretty lifeless performance by the group overall,” Sturm said.

            “We’re obviously not looking too good on the standings. But I thought at least one thing that was always going for us this year is that the group was competing hard,” he added. “We’ve always looked like everybody was trying and found a reason to play for something.” 

            Niederreiter's first goal came 6:24 into the first period on a power play. Reimer was heavily screened on the play.

            Granlund scored his first of the night in the second period by sneaking the puck through traffic and getting it past Reimer.

            While on the penalty kill, Sturm zipped down the ice to grab a puck that had left the defensive zone. He beat Predators defenseman Roman Josi to the puck and picked the far corner on Saros for a short-handed goal. 

            Nashville scored twice more in the second. On the first one, Granlund and Philip Tomasino completed a pretty 2-on-1.

            “He has a lot of skill. He can make some plays. It was a great pass by him,” Granlund said. “Like I said, throughout the lineup, we were making plays.”

            Trenin added his eighth of the season while shorthanded with 30 seconds to go in the period. 

            “Our PK has had some tough luck lately. They’ve been working really hard,” Duchene said. “I think tonight was a great effort for them, and it was nice to see them get rewarded with a goal.”

            Kaut beat Saros short side 50 seconds into the third for his second goal of the season. Kaut was acquired last month in a trade with Colorado.

            “There were some good things. Nice to see Kaut get a goal. I thought Tommy Hertl had a pretty good night. There were some bright spots, but you have to sift through a lot of bad to find the good,” Sharks coach David Quinn said.

            Niederreiter sent a pass in front, where San Jose forward Noah Gregor knocked the puck into his own net. It was Niederreiter's 18th goal of the season.

            Novak scored his eighth goal on the power play. Duchene made a great feed for his third assist of the game.

            “It was a fun game. I thought that we played with good energy (and) good speed,"" Predators coach John Hynes said. “I thought our execution with the puck was good from an offensive perspective. I thought we played with a lot of purpose to our game.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820355,Workers dig by layers in search for 47 missing at China mine,"ALXA LEAGUE, China (AP) — Work crews trying to find 47 people missing after a collapse at an open-pit mine in northern China have had to change their excavation methods to avoid causing more landslides, state media reported Friday.

            Six people have been confirmed dead and six injured people have been rescued at the mine in Inner Mongolia’s Alxa League as of Thursday night, broadcaster CCTV said.

            With a large collapsed area at the mine, the digging done by backhoes and bulldozers can risk more collapses. The crews are excavating by layers and making trapezoid-shaped descents to carry on their search from both sides of the mountain in an adjustment of their rescue plans, the report said.











            On Friday, heavy machines were seen working on the top level of the collapsed site, searching for trapped vehicles and missing persons.

            “It is very challenging to conduct rescue work,” Li Zhongzeng, head of Alxa League in Inner Mongolia, told CCTV. “Rescue workers from everywhere, including those in neighboring regions, are rushing to the site.” 

            The initial cave-in of one of the pit’s walls occurred at about 1 p.m. Wednesday, burying people and mining trucks below in tons of rocks and sand. A brief video of the collapse posted on the website of the Beijing Times showed a massive wall of reddish dirt or sand rushing down a slope onto mining vehicles moving below. 

            A subsequent landslide about five hours later halted rescue efforts before they resumed Thursday. 

            CCTV said 1,160 rescuers were currently at the scene. They were seen using heavy machines, shovels and rescue dogs in their search for miners.

            Chinese President Xi Jinping has called for an “all-out” search-and-rescue effort. 

            Wang Xiangxi, minister of emergency management, said authorities should investigate the disaster and hold accountable anyone who was responsible for it.

            Authorities in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region also issued an urgent notice asking all districts to perform safety checks and eliminate any hidden risks, according to a local state newspaper. It said every level of the government must learn lessons from the collapse and start planning inspections on open-pit mines in the region immediately. Those who do not comply with the request and cause accidents will be held accountable, it added. 

            On Friday, security remained tight at a checkpoint between Inner Mongolia and the neighboring region of Ningxia, with two police officers in yellow vests checking vehicles that were trying to get past what one of them called a “restricted” area.

            Some trucks were turned away from proceeding further, but others including one emergency services vehicle driving very fast with a siren blaring and a truck carrying rescue supplies were let in. The checkpoint appeared quieter compared to a day ago.

            The company running the mine, Inner Mongolia Xinjing Coal Industry Co. Ltd., was fined last year for multiple safety violations including insecure routes, unsafe storage of volatile materials and a lack of safety training, according to the news website The Paper.

            Inner Mongolia is a key region for mining of coal, minerals and rare earths that critics say has ravaged the region’s landscape of mountains, grassy steppes and deserts.

            China overwhelmingly relies on coal for power generation but has tried to cut the number of deadly mine accidents through a greater emphasis on safety and the closure of smaller operations that lacked necessary equipment.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820356,Jaquez Jr. leads No. 4 UCLA to 78-71 win over Utah,"SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Jaime Jaquez Jr. scored 17 of his 23 points in the second half and Tyger Campbell added 18 to lift No. 4 UCLA to a 78-71 win over Utah on Thursday night.

            “Jaime is a big-time player. He’s an All-American and a guy that’s going to play in the NBA for 10-12 years, so it’s not a surprise,” UCLA coach Mick Cronin said.

            Jaquez, who was UCLA’s only effective offensive player in the second half, made a 3-pointer with 1:03 remaining to seal the win just moments after Campbell made a 3 from the corner.











            “I prepare myself to be in these situations,” Jaquez said. “My guys have faith in me that I’m going to make the right play every time down the stretch.”

            UCLA (24-4, 15-2 Pac-12) has won seven in a row despite giving up more than 70 points for just the fourth time this season.

            “The key is number one, taking care of the ball, and two, relying on your defense to get things done, not your offense,” Campbell said.

            Mike Saunders Jr. came off the bench to score a career-high 25 points for Utah (17-12, 10-8 Pac-12), which has lost three in a row.

            “Honestly, it felt amazing and it was crazy because I envisioned it,” Saunders said. “I was just waiting for an opportunity. I feel like my teammates believe in me.”

            The Utes played without their starting backcourt of Rollie Worster and Gabe Madsen, who are both injured. Utah finally started making 3-pointers in the second half and cut the Bruins lead to 62-59 after Wilguens Exacte and Saunders hit from beyond the arc.

            But Jaquez came up with baskets when the Bruins needed them most.

            “The game was never in jeopardy,” Cronin said, despite Utah’s late runs. “When you have Jaime and Tyger, it’s easy to be confident.”

            Utah held the Bruins without a field goal for more than six minutes in the middle of the second half, highlighted by a couple of thunderous blocks from Branden Carlson and Keba Keita. 

            “It was a heck of an effort. We’re not into moral victories but really, really proud of the way they played today,” Utah coach Craig Smith said.

            Saunders, who only had three points in all of conference play coming into the game, brought a new element of speed to the Utes but made some mistakes characteristic of seldom-used players.

            “He’s going to learn. They were some things tonight he’s got to do better, but he really sparked us on the offensive end,” Smith said.

            UCLA’s 15-2 mark through 17 Pac-12 games marks the program’s best conference start since the 2007-08 Final Four team with Kevin Love and Russell Westbrook.

            Jaquez thinks this team can go even further.

            “National championship. That’s what we got in mind,” Jacquez said.

            Tyger Campbell scored 10 of his points in the first half and helped manufacture open shots for his teammates while the Bruins held the Utes to 33 percent and 0-for-10 from 3-point range to take a 43-31 lead at halftime.

            BIG PICTURE

            UCLA: The Bruins took what the Utes gave them, so they consistently scored from the mid-range. Even with their scoring drought, the Bruins took care of the ball with only six turnovers, marking the 27th of 28 games this season they have less giveaways than their opponent.

            Utah: The Utes made it difficult at times for the Bruins with a determined effort on the boards and a lot of hustle, but the Utes couldn’t shoot. Without their guards, Saunders was a pleasant surprise, but it didn’t matter because UCLA shot so well early and held Carlson in check.

            POLL IMPLICATIONS

            UCLA has been in the Top 10 for the last month and further upward mobility will probably depend on one of the top three losing this weekend.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820357,Flotsam found off New York may be from famous SS Savannah,"NEW YORK (AP) — A chunk of weather-beaten flotsam that washed up on a New York shoreline after Tropical Storm Ian last fall has piqued the interest of experts who say it is likely part of the SS Savannah, which ran aground and broke apart in 1821, two years after it became the first vessel to cross the Atlantic Ocean partly under steam power.

            The roughly 13-foot (4-meter) square piece of wreckage was spotted in October off Fire Island, a barrier island that hugs Long Island's southern shore, and is now in the custody of the Fire Island Lighthouse Preservation Society. It will work with National Park Service officials to identify the wreckage and put it on public display.

            “It was pretty thrilling to find it,” said Betsy DeMaria, a museum technician at the park service's Fire Island National Seashore. “We definitely are going to have some subject matter experts take a look at it and help us get a better view of what we have here.”











            It may be difficult to identify the wreckage with 100% certainty, but park service officials said the Savannah is a top contender among Fire Island’s known shipwrecks.

            Explorers have searched for the Savannah for over two centuries but have not found anything they could definitively link to the famous ship. The newly discovered wreckage, though, “very well could be” a piece of the historic shipwreck, said Ira Breskin, a senior lecturer at the State University of New York Maritime College in the Bronx. “It makes perfect sense.”

            Evidence includes the 1-to-1.3-inch (2.5-to-3.3-centimeter) wooden pegs holding the wreckage's planks together, consistent with a 100-foot (30.5-meter) vessel, park service officials said in a news release. The Savannah was 98 feet, 6 inches (30 meters) long. Additionally, the officials said, the wreckage's iron spikes suggest a ship built around 1820. The Savannah was built in 1818.

            Breskin, author of “The Business of Shipping,” noted that the Savannah's use of steam power was so advanced for its time that the May 24, 1819, start of its transatlantic voyage is commemorated as National Maritime Day. “It's important because they were trying to basically show the viability of a steam engine to make it across the pond,” he said.

            Breskin said a nautical archaeologist should be able to help identify the Fire Island wreckage, which appears likely to be from the Savannah. “It's plausible, and it's important, and it's living history if the scientists confirm that it is what we think it is,” he said.

            The Savannah, a sailing ship outfitted with a 90-horsepower steam engine, traveled mainly under sail across the Atlantic, using steam power for 80 hours of the nearly month-long passage to Liverpool, England.

            Crowds cheered as the Savannah sailed from Liverpool to Sweden and Russia and then back to its home port of Savannah, Georgia, but the ship was not a financial success, in part because people were afraid to travel on the hybrid vessel. The Savannah's steam engine was removed and sold after the ship's owners suffered losses in the Great Savannah Fire of 1820.

            The Savannah was transporting cargo between Savannah and New York when it ran aground off Fire Island. It later broke apart. The crew made it safely to shore and the cargo of cotton was salvaged, but the Augusta Chronicle & Georgia Gazette reported that “Captain Holdridge was considerably hurt by being upset in the boat.”

            Explorers have searched for the Savannah over the two centuries since it but have not found anything they could definitively link to the famous ship.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820378,"Japanese Americans won redress, fight for Black reparations","SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — When Miya Iwataki and other Japanese Americans fought in the 1980s for the U.S. government to apologize to the families it imprisoned during World War II, Black politicians and civil rights leaders were integral to the movement.

            Thirty-five years after they won that apology — and survivors of prison camps received $20,000 each— those advocates are now demanding atonement for Black Americans whose ancestors were enslaved. From California to Washington, D.C., activists are joining revived reparations movements and pushing for formal government compensation for the lasting harm of slavery's legacy on subsequent generations, from access to housing and education to voting rights and employment.

            Advocating for reparations is “the right thing to do,” said Iwataki, a resident of South Pasadena, California who is in her 70s. She cited cross-cultural solidarity that has built up over decades.











            Black lawmakers such as the late California congressmen Mervyn Dymally and Ron Dellums played critical roles in winning the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, which formalized the government's apology and redress payments. 

            Last Sunday marked the 81st anniversary of President Franklin D. Roosevelt signing an executive order that allowed the government to force an estimated 125,000 people — two-thirds of them U.S. citizens — from their homes and businesses, and incarcerate them in desolate, barbed-wire camps throughout the west.

            “We want to help other communities win reparations, because it was so important to us,"" Iwataki said.

            After stalling for decades at the federal level, reparations for slavery has received new interest amid a national reckoning over the 2020 police killing of George Floyd. Amid nationwide protests that year, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed legislation that established a first-in-the-nation task force to address the topic of slave reparations. 

            Other cities and counties have since followed, including Boston, St. Louis, and San Francisco, where an advisory committee issued a draft recommendation last year proposing a lump-sum payment of $5 million apiece for eligible individuals. 

            In December, the National Nikkei Reparations Coalition, alongside more than 70 other Japanese American and Asian American organizations, submitted a letter calling on the Biden administration to establish a presidential commission. 

            Japanese American activists in California are studying the landmark report issued by California's task force — and plan to reach out to college students, churches and other community groups to raise awareness about why Black reparations is needed — and how it intersects with their own struggle.

            Reparations critics say that monetary compensation and other forms of atonement are not necessary when no one alive today was enslaved or a slave owner, overlooking the inequities today impacting later generations of Black Americans.

            Retired teacher Kathy Masaoka of Los Angeles, who testified in 1981 for Japanese American redress and in 2021 in favor of federal reparations legislation, says they are just beginning to educate their own community about Black history and anti-Black prejudice. 

            She said that starting conversations in her community is “undoing a lot of ideas that people have” about American history and the case for reparations, said Masaoka, 74.

            San Francisco attorney Don Tamaki, who is Japanese, is the only person appointed to California’s nine-member task force who is not Black. 

            At meetings, he shared how critical it was for organizers to arrange for former detainees to tell their stories to national media outlets. Redress advocates had to make hard decisions though, such as agreeing to legislation that denied reparations to an estimated 2,000 Latin Americans of Japanese descent who were also incarcerated. 

            There is no equivalence to the experiences of the Japanese American and Black American communities, Tamaki said, but there are similar lessons, such as the need for a massive public education campaign. 

            Only 30% of U.S. adults surveyed by the Pew Research Center in 2021 supported reparations for slavery, 77% of whom were Black Americans. Support among Latinos and Asians was 39% and 33%, respectively, and white Americans had the lowest rate of support, at 18%.

            Some advocates said that the idea of reparations for the World War II incarceration camps was once considered outlandish. But many young, third-generation Japanese Americans were inspired to mobilize from civil rights and ethnic pride movements, including the Black Panther Party and the Brown Berets, who promoted Chicano rights.

            Some advocates were outraged by — and threatened to boycott — hearings set up by a 1980 federal commission on Japanese internment, called it a delaying tactic. But the testimonies that came out of public hearings the following year served as a turning point. 

            For the first time, many survivors shared stories that even their families didn’t know, educating not only the younger generation but the broader American public.

            “There was not a dry eye in the house at those hearings,” said Iwataki, who worked with the National Coalition for Redress/Reparations to arrange transportation to the hearings, as well as meals and translators, for former detainees. 

            Many young Japanese Americans went from frustration with their grandparents and parents for not fighting back to understanding how vulnerable they were, said Ron Wakabayashi, who was then national director of the Japanese American Citizens League. The average age of second-generation Japanese Americans who were incarcerated in the camps was only 18, he said. 

            “Probably the more important thing that we got out of that was the generational healing, and the restoration of our identity,” said Wakabayashi, 78. 

            The commission found no military necessity for the camps, saying the detentions stemmed broadly from “race prejudice, war hysteria and a failure of political leadership,” according to a report issued in 1983. 

            President Ronald Reagan signed the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, providing living survivors with a formal apology and $20,000 each for the “grave injustice” done to them. It would cost the U.S. government about $1.6 billion.

            Throughout the process, activists said, the Congressional Black Caucus remained a steadfast supporter of reparations. Then-Rep. Dymally authored a reparations bill in 1982 and later, provided his staff and office support so that advocates could lobby other members of Congress. 

            Another California congressman, Rep. Dellums, delivered a searing speech on the House floor of being a 6-year-old boy watching as his best friend, a Japanese American boy of the same age, was taken away to the camps.

            A year after Reagan signed Japanese reparations into law, the late Congressman John Conyers introduced a bill to consider slavery reparations, named after the promise of 40 acres and a mule that the U.S. initially made to freed slaves. The bill has gone nowhere. 

            Dreisen Heath, an advocate for Black reparations, plans to travel from her home in the Washington, D.C. area to California in coming months to join artist and writer traci kato-kiriyama, whose parents were incarcerated as children, in leading workshops and educational forums. 

            They hope to engage young Japanese American and Black American students in the current movement. 

            “Nothing ever worthwhile in this country has ever happened without intergenerational, multiracial (coalition) building,” said Heath. “I see the Japanese American community, and by extension the Asian American community, indispensable to realizing reparations for Black people.”SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — When Miya Iwataki and other Japanese Americans fought in the 1980s for the U.S. government to apologize to the families it imprisoned during World War II, Black politicians and civil rights leaders were integral to the movement.Thirty-five years after they won that apology — and survivors of prison camps received $20,000 each— those advocates are now demanding atonement for Black Americans whose ancestors were enslaved.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820379,World Baseball Classic in Japan to still feature masks,"TOKYO (AP) — Fans of the upcoming World Baseball Classic are going to see two versions, depending whether the games are in the United States or Taiwan, or in Japan.

            In the United States and Taiwan, fans can cheer and need not wear masks. Taiwan dropped most of its mask mandates this week.

            For Japan, it’s slightly more complicated as COVID-pandemic rules are changing more slowly. Cheering will be allowed, but masks will be worn at the Tokyo Dome.











            The first three days of play in the WBC are March 8-10 in Taiwan and Japan. Play begins on March 11 at the two U.S. sites in Miami and Phoenix. 

            The tournament, featuring 20 national teams, ends on March 21 in Miami. The powers from Asia will be Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Australia. 

            Latin America will feature the largest contingent with Colombia, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Venezuela, Panama and Nicaragua. The United States and Canada have also entered strong teams.

            After almost three years of strict COVID-19 rules, traditional cheering returned to this week during preseason games for Nippon Professional Baseball. That included the drum-beating, trumpet-playing, and constant singing that characterizes the game in Japan.

            
                The Japan national team training for the WBC will play warm-up games this weekend and avid cheering will also be encouraged.

            However, masks will still be worn.

            “I expect a situation where fans will be able to cheer while wearing masks,” NPB General Secretary Atsushi Ihara told Japan’s Kyodo News recently. He was speaking about the upcoming Japanese season.

            The Japanese government is expected to relax the mask-wearing guidelines on March 13, leaving many mask-wearing choices up to the individual.

            WBC play in Japan ends on March 16, but the policy change is not expected to touch the tournament with masks still being worn.

            The shift away from masks has been slow in Japan, where much of the public donned masks even before the pandemic. Few Japanese go without masks, even in outdoor areas like parks and broad sidewalks.

            The government policy announced on March 13 will still recommend mask-wearing for crowded indoor settings -- the WBC venue the Tokyo Dome is indoors -- commuter trains, and hospitals.

            Businesses will also be allowed to ask customers to wear masks.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820381,Ukraine tensions flare at G-20 finance meetings in India,"BENGALURU, India (AP) — Tensions over Russia’s war on Ukraine flared Friday at meetings of financial chiefs of the Group of 20 leading economies, where geopolitics affected the atmosphere if not the agenda of the gathering in the Indian technology hub of Bengaluru. 

            U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen condemned the “illegal and unjustified war against Ukraine” at a session attended by Russian officials and reiterated calls for G-20 nations to do more to support Ukraine and hinder Moscow's war effort. 

            “I urge the Russian officials here at the G-20 to understand that their continued work for the Kremlin makes them complicit in Putin’s atrocities,"" Yellen said. “They bear responsibility for the lives and livelihoods being taken in Ukraine and the harm caused globally.”











            As the meetings convened on the one-year anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, such issues were bound to crop up, despite host India's reluctance to be caught between allies of Ukraine and Russia and other countries supporting Moscow, such as China. 

            In kicking off the meetings Friday, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi avoided mention of Ukraine. 

            Meeting on the G-20 sidelines, Yellen and British Treasury chief Jeremy Hunt condemned the war and said they were working together to deal with the crisis. 

            Hunt praised efforts to support Ukraine, according to remarks provided by U.S. Treasury officials.

            “We are pleased that there is such unity among democracies that this cannot be allowed to happen. We don’t think the job is by any means done,” he said.

            “There is no choice between whether we focus on Ukraine or focus on other important global issues like climate change. In the end if we don’t resolve global security threats, there can be no progress on these other areas,” Hunt said. 

            The wording of a communique due to be issued Saturday when the talks wrap up was evidently still under discussion, as other forums such as the Group of Seven prepared to announce new sanctions against Russia. 

            At the last major G-20 meeting, in Bali, Indonesia, G-20 leaders strongly condemned the war, warning that the conflict is intensifying fragilities in the world’s economy. They finessed divisions among them given that the group includes Russia and also countries like China and India that have significant trade ties with Moscow and have stopped short of outright criticism of the war. 

            “In Bali, high level leaders decided on strong condemnation of the brutal attack by Russia and as finance ministers we must stick to it,” French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told reporters at a news conference. He said he would walk out if the gathering failed to evince a strong stance against the war.

            A senior Indian official, speaking on condition they not be named because the talks were confidential, said as hosts India was determined to work toward a consensus and come out with a communique.

            In welcoming the G-20 policymakers, Modi urged them to focus on helping the world's most vulnerable people. 

            “You represent the leadership of global finance and economy at a time when the world is facing serious economic difficulties,"" Modi said in a video address. 

            As countries deal with slew of challenges in the aftermath of the pandemic, including unsustainable debt, conflict, inflation and eroding trust in international financial institutions, “It is up to you, the custodians of the leading economies and market systems ... to bring back stability, confidence and growth to the global economy,"" he said. 

            The meetings in Bengaluru were due to touch on a wide range of issues including digital currencies and payments, reform of institutions like the World Bank, climate change and financial inclusion. 

            Multiple meetings between various leaders were also taking place, including talks between India’s finance minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, and her counterparts from France and Brazil. 

            The G-20 meetings offer a chance for leaders to consider how to coordinate their policies: many central banks including the U.S. Federal Reserve have been raising interest rates sharply to try to rein in decades-high inflation brought on by various factors including the war and rebounding demand for travel, goods and services following the COVID-19 pandemic. 

            With increases in income lagging behind, rising costs for food, housing, fuel and fertilizer impose huge burdens, especially on the poor and in developing nations, where debt burdens have surged both at the national and household levels. 

            As the G-20 host this year, India is taking the opportunity to showcase its ascent as an economic power. 

            Modi suggested the gathering could “draw hope from the vibrant Indian economy,"" which is forecast to grow at a more than 6% annual pace this year, making it one of the fastest growing in the world. He also pointed to the country’s digital payments technology as a model to be emulated.

Shao ran a travel agency on the offshore island of Kinmen, close to China’s Fujian Province.At his request, Hsiang signed two statements, in October 2019 and January 2020, promising to cooperate with the Chinese military. Shao also supplied him with a list of senior officers he should be collecting confidential information about.According to the Liberty Times report, Shao’s case will be handled by the Kinmen Prosecutors Office in relation to the National Security Act and bribery charges.",2023/02/24,2959,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820395,"Wargame shows Taiwan, US, Japan together could prevent Chinese invasion","TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A Japanese think tank simulation found that if the U.S. and Japan became involved in a war between Taiwan and China, Washington and Tokyo could prevent Beijing from invading the country, but at a heavy cost.

Nikkei reported that a tabletop wargame was conducted over four days through Jan. 21 by Japan’s Sasakawa Peace Foundation, involving around 30 participants, including former Japan Self-Defense Force (SDF) officers and Japanese and American academics and researchers. The exercise simulated a Chinese amphibious invasion of Taiwan in 2026.

            The simulation had Taiwanese, American, and Japanese forces facing off against China. In it, the People’s Liberation Army set up a command center capable of deploying all air, submarine, and surface vessel capabilities. The U.S. responded by dispatching nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and advanced fighter jets to locations in and around Taiwan.

            In the wargame, Japan’s prime minister declared a national state of emergency and let America use SDF bases in addition to civilian airports in Okinawa and Kyushu. The exercise then saw Japan call the invasion an “existential threat” after learning Beijing was planning to attack SDF bases used by American forces, Nikkei said.











            Japanese warships and its F-35 fighter jets then take part in missile strikes against Chinese forces. China was eventually beaten by the U.S.-Japan response, with the fighting taking more than two weeks, per the report.

            The simulation found Chinese military supplies getting cut off, and the decisive move came after the allies took control of Taiwan airspace.

            The wargame found that there would be heavy losses for all parties involved. Taiwan experienced 13,000 dead or wounded troops, and lost 200 warplanes and 18 warships, while the U.S. saw 10,700 troop casualties and lost 400 planes and 19 naval vessels.

            Japan saw 2,500 troop casualties and lost 144 fighter jets and 15 warships. Meanwhile, China lost more than 40,000 troops killed or wounded and lost 168 jet fighters, 48 military transport aircraft, and 156 warships, including two aircraft carriers.

            The report noted the Sasakawa simulation was based on the military hardware and capabilities possessed by countries today, and that the actual outcome in 2026 could be different if Beijing significantly increases its military power.TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A Japanese think tank simulation found that if the U.S. and Japan became involved in a war between Taiwan and China, Washington and Tokyo could prevent Beijing from invading the country, but at a heavy cost.Nikkei reported that a tabletop wargame was conducted over four days through Jan. 21 by Japan’s Sasakawa Peace Foundation, involving around 30 participants, including former Japan Self-Defense Force (SDF) officers and Japanese and American academics and researchers.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820408,Joy amid sorrow: 1st birthdays muted for Ukrainian parents,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Anastasiia Morhun knew having a baby would change her life. She prepared rigorously, read up about newborns and daydreamed about the kind of parents she and her husband would be. But there was no way to be ready for the war that Russia unleashed against her country Feb. 24, 2022 — the day she gave birth to Roman.

            “In one moment, everything was ruined,” Morhun said. 

            Instead of quiet first moments between mother and newborn, Morhun and Roman spent their early time together in the maternity hospital bomb shelter, as air raid sirens howled and missiles struck across Ukraine. Morhun was in pain from her cesarean section. It was, she said, “one long, long dark day.”











            “I was learning to be a mother,"" Morhun, 29, said. “But it was actually much easier than accepting the reality of war.”

            The 24th of February is forever etched in the collective consciousness of all Ukrainians — and for women who gave birth and men who became fathers as the bombs began to fall, the day holds especially complicated emotions. 

            Bringing forth life just as the Russian onslaught started to snatch other lives away gave rise to both joy and terror — a sour-sweet mix for brand-new parents. When they blow out their kids' first candle Friday — and on all birthdays in years to come — other Ukrainians will be lighting candles for the dead.

            Of the past 365 days, Morhun said: “It’s been a very difficult but very happy year for me."" 

            She counts herself lucky: Roman is healthy and seems so far untraumatized. Morhun herself, however, hasn't shaken off dark memories of his first days, particularly a missile attack that struck an apartment close to their maternity center in the capital, Kyiv, two days after his birth.

            “That was the first time I felt truly scared,” she said. ""You just grab your child and run to the basement.”

            Alina Mustafaieva, 30, became a first-time mom when her daughter, Yeva, was born as first explosions echoed across Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, close to the eastern border with Russia.

            “We saw a glow looming over the city,” she said. As nurses were checking Yeva, she forced herself to think positive thoughts, refusing to let the war destroy her magic moment.

            “I gave birth to my Yeva, and I wanted to be happy about it,"" she said.

            Mustafaieva is so conflicted about Friday — a birthday for Yeva, a tragic anniversary for Ukraine — that she has decided to move her daughter's celebrations back a day, to Saturday. Her 1-year-old will be feted with a party, a photo booth, cake, balloons and a puffy dress. 

            Her mom wants Yeva to celebrate an “ordinary” birthday, as children not born that painful day do. 

            “It’s a tragedy for the whole country, for every Ukrainian,” she said. “My family was lucky, we didn’t lose anyone or anything. But many did, and we have to share this loss together.""

            Curious and playful, Yeva is now crawling, roaming on all fours around Mustafaieva's apartment. That brings joy, but also a fresh set of worries when explosions ring out. Mustafaieva instinctively pulls Yeva away from the windows. She hopes Yeva is too young for any bad memories to stick.

            “I don’t think she’ll remember everything she went through with me. All those escapes, long trips, hiding in the bomb shelter or even the blasts,” Mustafaieva said. “But when she grows up, I will tell her everything in detail. I will be this type of parent who will explain to children what the Russian Federation represents.” 

            Although parents hope that invasion-day babies won't be scarred by their first year of life, they can't help but associate their toddlers' early milestones with bloodshed and fear.

            Anastasiia Havryshenko gave birth to her second child, a boy, shortly after midday Feb. 24, at a maternity center in Sumy, another city repeatedly struck in the northeast. 

            She's haunted by how different Artem's birth was from that of her first child. 

            She felt helpless and burst into tears as she, the doctors and other mothers sat out an attack in a basement. She thought to herself: “I didn’t give birth to him so he had to hide in the bomb shelter."" 

            “I knew it wasn’t supposed to be like this. It was not normal and psychologically, very tough. Very tough,"" she said.

            She remembers Artem’s first outdoor walk. The city streets were empty, most shops closed, but she wanted him to breathe fresh air. After 10 minutes outside, sirens blared. She heard a plane and saw people running into basements. She hurried back with Artem to her apartment.

            Back inside, an explosion shattered windows and doors. Power and water went out. She hugged Artem, crying helplessly with him on their sofa. 

            ""All I wanted was to understand why it was happening to us. What had we done wrong?” she said. 

            A year on, she's adapted as best she can, staying with her husband in Sumy and refusing to join the millions of refugees who have had to uproot in search of safety elsewhere. Like millions of other Ukrainians, she's learned survival skills to cope with power outages caused by Russian bombardments. She cooks whenever electricity comes back on and maintains stocks of bottled water.

            “We have just one life, so we need to move on, hope for the best, and to give what we can to our children,” she said.

            Humor helps, too. The family's inside joke is that Artem — born three weeks ahead of his due-date — chose Feb. 24 to pop out his little head. 

            “We call him ‘general’ because he has a commander's character,"" his mom said. “He is our general and our young defender. He himself knew when he should be born.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820412,"Stocks drop, send Wall Street to its worst week of the year","NEW YORK (AP) — Another cold reminder that inflation remains hotter than hoped sent Wall Street skidding Friday, and stocks closed out their worst week since early December. 

            The S&P 500 fell 1.1% to cap its third straight weekly loss. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped as many as 510 points before closing down 336 points, or 1%, while the Nasdaq composite lost 1.7%. 

            Stocks have dropped through February as a stream of reports have shown everything from inflation to the job market to spending by shoppers is staying hotter than expected. That’s forced Wall Street to raise its forecasts for how high the Federal Reserve will have to take interest rates and then how long to keep them there.











            Higher rates can drive down inflation, but they also raise the risk of a recession because they slow the economy. They likewise hurt prices for stocks and other investments.

            The latest reminder came Friday after a report showed that the measure of inflation preferred by the Fed came in higher than expected. It said prices were 4.7% higher in January than a year earlier, after ignoring costs for food and energy because they can swing more quickly than others. That was an acceleration from December’s inflation rate, showing the wrong momentum, and it was higher than economists’ expectations for 4.3%.

            It echoed other reports from earlier in the month that showed inflation at both the consumer and wholesale levels was higher than expected in January. 

            Other data Friday showed that consumer spending returned to growth in January, rising 1.8% from December. That's pivotal because spending by consumers makes up the largest piece of the economy. A separate reading on sentiment among consumers came in slightly stronger than earlier thought, while sales of new homes improved a bit more than expected. 

            Such strength paired with the remarkably resilient job market raises hope that the economy can avoid a recession in the near term. 

            But it can also feed into upward pressure on inflation, and Wall Street worries it could push the Fed to raise rates even higher and keep them there even longer than it otherwise would. 

            “It puts the final nail in the coffin in the shift we’ve seen the last several weeks where the market has come around to what the Fed has been saying for a while: rates above 5% and there for longer,” said Ross Mayfield, investment strategy analyst at Baird.

            After earlier doubting that the Fed would raise its key overnight rate as high as it was saying, and believing that it may even cut rates later this year, traders are increasing bets on the Fed's rate rising to at least 5.25% and staying that high through the end of the year. 

            It's currently in a range of 4.50% to 4.75%, and it was at virtually zero a year ago. 

            High rates and inflation increase the risk of a recession down the line, even if the most important part of the economy has been resilient.

            “The consumer is hanging in there, but the consensus seems to be there’s a lot of trading down” by shoppers to less-expensive items, Mayfield said. “If you’re looking out a year and banking on the consumer sector to hang in there, every extra month it becomes a dicier proposition.”

            He expects the economy's growth to fall below its long-term trend if not fall into a minor recession, though he's not anticipating a worst-case downturn.

            Expectations for a firmer Fed have caused yields in the Treasury market to shoot higher this month, and they climbed further Friday.

            The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 3.94% from 3.89% late Thursday. It helps set rates for mortgages and other important loans. The two-year yield, which moves more on expectations for the Fed, rose to 4.79% from 4.71% and is near its highest level since 2007. 

            Tech and high-growth stocks once again took the brunt of the pressure. Investments seen as the most expensive, riskiest or making their investors wait the longest for big growth are among the most vulnerable to higher rates. 

            Microsoft, Apple Amazon and Tesla all fell at least 1.8% and were the heaviest weights on the S&P 500 because their immense size gives them more sway on the index. 

            Software company Autodesk fell to the largest loss in the index, down 12.9% despite reporting stronger profit and revenue for the latest quarter than expected. Analysts said investors were disappointed with its forecasts for upcoming results. 

            
                Boeing lost 4.8% after it stopped deliveries of its 787 passenger jet because of questions around a supplier’s analysis of a part near the front of the plane.

            All told, the S&P 500 fell 42.28 points to 3,970.04. The Dow dropped 336.99 to 32,816.92, and the Nasdaq fell 195.46 to 11,394.94.

            Stock markets abroad also mostly fell, with a 1.8% drop for France's main index and 1.7% fall in Hong Kong. 

            Japan's Nikkei 225 was an outlier, rising 1.3%. The nominee to head the country's central bank, economist Kazuo Ueda, told lawmakers he favors keeping Japan’s benchmark interest rate near zero to ensure stable growth. That's despite Japan reporting its core consumer price index, excluding volatile fresh foods, rose the most in 41 years in January.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820414,"Israel's outpost approvals boost settlers, deepen conflict","GIVAT HAREL, West Bank (AP) — One day in the fall of 1998, Shivi Drori, a young farmer fresh out of the Israeli army, brought three trailers to a rugged hilltop deep in the occupied West Bank and began to plant raspberries.

            It was an unauthorized settlement in the heart of territory claimed by the Palestinians, but Drori, now 49, said he considered himself to be “in a way, working with the government.” 

            Today, more than 90 Jewish families live in what has become the thriving village of Givat Harel — full of concrete homes with breathtaking views, a crowded nursery and an award-winning vineyard.











            Just down the road is Turmus Aya, a Palestinian village that lost part of its land to the nearby Shilo settlement two decades ago. One of the villagers, Amal Abu Awad, 58, has watched her world shrink since the settlers arrived.

            She said settlers prevented her late husband from reaching his grazing land and periodically uprooted her olive trees. Last week, masked vandals attacked her house, armed with clubs and knives, shouting insults as they smashed windows and broke her solar panels.

            Her seven sons now take turns perching on the roof overnight, watching out for vigilantes. 

            “This was our land long before they thought to claim it,” she said.

            Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s new far-right government announced last week it would legalize Givat Harel, along with nine other unauthorized West Bank outposts, boosting settlers' morale and strengthening their hold on the land.

            Drori’s village, on a ridge between the Palestinian cities of Ramallah and Nablus, is part of an extensive network of 150 outposts now home to some 20,000 settlers, according to anti-settlement watchdog Peace Now. The outposts appeared over the past three decades, many built at least partially on private Palestinian land, Peace Now says.

            While the outposts were established without formal government authorization, they often received tacit government support or even public funding. Over 20% of the outposts, like Givat Harel, have been retroactively legalized, and more are in the pipeline.

            Anti-settlement groups and experts describe a steady government effort to entrench Israeli rule over the West Bank and grab more occupied land that Palestinians seek for a future state. Strings of strategically located outposts have changed the landscape of the territory — threatening to make a future Palestinian state little more than a shriveled constellation of disconnected enclaves.

            “We see this as a very big move toward annexation,” said Ziv Stahl, director of Israeli rights group Yesh Din. “Cementing the existence of these places blocks any hope for Palestinians to ever get their land back.”

            On Monday, days after the government’s outpost approvals triggered widespread condemnation, Netanyahu declared a six-month freeze in recognizing new outposts — part of a U.S.-brokered agreement to avert a diplomatic crisis at the United Nations. 

            As a result, the U.N. Security Council approved a watered-down statement opposing Israel’s expansion of settlements, derailing a legally binding resolution that would have demanded a halt to Israeli settlement activity. 

            But Netanyahu made no public commitment to halt settlement construction. On Thursday, his government granted approval for over 7,000 new homes in Jewish settlements across the West Bank. Some of those homes, settlement opponents said, are located in four outposts that remain unauthorized.

            Netanyahu's freeze “is meaningless,” said Lior Amihai from Peace Now.

            Settlement critics describe a wink-and-nod policy toward outposts traced back to efforts by successive governments to deflect international pressure. Most of the world considers all Israeli settlements — home to some 700,000 people in the West Bank and annexed east Jerusalem — as a violation of international law. 

            In 1996, Israel pledged it would not establish new settlements as part of peace-making efforts with the Palestinians, but said it would need to keep building in existing ones to accommodate natural growth.

            Since then, successive governments have made a distinction between authorized settlements and “illegal” outposts, such as Dori's Givat Harel. 

            Like many others, Givat Harel straddles both public and private land — including agricultural land belonging to the Palestinian villages of Sinjil and Qaryout, according to Dror Etkes, an anti-settlement activist who follows Israeli land policy in the West Bank. 

            From the outpost, both villages, along with other Palestinian towns, can be seen nestled in the undulating hills.

            Drori dismissed claims of Palestinian ownership, saying the hilltop had long been vacant.

            “We were fulfilling government desires, just in a weird way,” he said, speaking at the settlement’s vineyard, which exports some 100,000 bottles a year of locally produced Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and marquee blends named “Dancing Hills.” 

            ""It’s always hush-hush,"" he said. 

            Givat Harel popped up during the first outpost building boom in the 1990s. Encouraged by Ariel Sharon, Israel's foreign minister in 1998 who famously exhorted settlers to “run and grab"" Palestinian hilltops, Drori arrived at the scenic ridge.

            Sharon even gifted Givat Harel its first water tankers, Drori said. The Ministry of Construction poured money into new houses. The local settler council installed electric towers, paved roads and piped water to the homes. In a sign of legitimacy, Israeli soldiers guarded the front gate.

            Neighboring Palestinians, who could only obtain power from solar panels and routinely faced home demolitions because they lacked building permits in the Israeli-controlled part of the West Bank, warily eyed the outpost’s fresh paint and irrigated gardens.

            Drori says he's a pioneer willing to live in a hostile land promised by God. As for the Palestinians, he said, “If you want to stay here, you have to get used to the Israeli government.” 

            A 2005 government report revealed widespread collusion among officials to illicitly divert state funds to unauthorized outposts. Its author, Talia Sasson, called for the immediate removal of outposts on private Palestinian land. Yet no action was taken against more than 100 outposts she identified.

            Over the years, the United States and other Israeli allies decried settlements as an obstacle to peace. To avoid international censure, Israel repeatedly promised to dismantle the rogue outposts — but only two major ones were evacuated. Others were strategically registered as new neighborhoods of established settlements.

            Now, settlers find their closest allies at the highest government levels. On Thursday, Netanyahu’s new coalition officially granted Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, a settler leader, authority over settlement construction. 

            Drori said Smotrich, a long-time friend, prayed and celebrated at Givat Harel the night of the recognition decision.

            “Things will really change here for the good,” Drori said, describing his dreams to build an elementary school and expand the synagogue. 

            Smotrich and other far-right ministers plan to spend billions expanding and investing in settlements. Rights groups warn this will deepen the conflict with the Palestinians and lead to more bloodshed.

            Down an unpaved dirt road in Turmus Aya, Abu Awad fixed her eyes on the hilltop overlooking her home. Last month settlers tried to set fire to a nearby house, burning the car in the driveway. Then last week came the attack on her home. 

            Police said they arrested two suspects over the arson attack. Palestinians, who are prosecuted in military courts with an extremely high conviction rate, have long complained about impunity enjoyed by settlers, who are charged, if at all, in civil ones.

            “They cut the electricity so it was pitch black,” Abu Awad said. “In the dark, they could do whatever they wanted.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820476,The calculus of war: Tallying Ukraine toll an elusive task,"GENEVA (AP) — Quantifying the toll of Russia's war in Ukraine remains an elusive goal a year into the conflict. 

            Estimates of the casualties, refugees and economic fallout from the war produce an incomplete picture of the deaths and suffering. Precise figures may never emerge for some of the categories international organizations are attempting to track. 

            U.N. human rights experts count civilians killed and wounded, but know their tally falls significantly short. Neither Russia nor Ukraine has provided an updated accounting of their troop losses. 











            Even the scope of the weaponry that Western countries have sent Ukraine is murky. 

            Here’s a look at some of the numbers as Friday marks one year since Russian forces invaded Ukraine, with no end to the war in sight.

            THE EVOLUTION OF AN INVASION

            Roughly 5,000 missile strikes, 3,500 airstrikes and 1,000 drone strikes: Firepower that Russia has launched against Ukraine over the past year, according to Brig. Gen. Oleksiy Hromov, a senior official in the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.

            18: The percentage of total Ukrainian land controlled by Russian forces as of Thursday, according to the Institute for the Study of War, a think tank. That’s down from 27% on March 23, before Ukrainian counteroffensives recaptured vast swaths of land — but up from the 7% held by Russia and Russia-aligned separatists before Feb. 24, 2022, as part of an armed rebellion in eastern Ukraine that began in 2014, and Russia's annexation of Crimea that year.

            71,905: Potential Russian war crimes — killings, kidnappings, indiscriminate bombings and sexual assaults — that are under investigation by Ukraine’s prosecutor-general. Reporting by The Associated Press and “Frontline,” recorded in a public database, has independently verified 639 incidents that appear to violate the laws of war.

            THE CASUALTIES

            8,006: Confirmed civilian deaths in Ukraine since Russia's invasion, through Feb. 15, according to the U.N. human rights office. The office uses strict methodology and says verification of thousands of reported casualties is still pending in Russian-occupied cities such as Mariupol, Lysychansk, and Sievierodonetsk.

            3,382: Civilian deaths in Ukraine recorded by the U.N. rights office for March 2022, the highest number for a single month of the war. 

            13,287: Civilians injured in the conflict over the last year, according to the U.N.

            Follow AP's coverage of the war in Ukraine: https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraineGENEVA (AP) — Quantifying the toll of Russia's war in Ukraine remains an elusive goal a year into the conflict.Estimates of the casualties, refugees and economic fallout from the war produce an incomplete picture of the deaths and suffering. Precise figures may never emerge for some of the categories international organizations are attempting to track.U.N. human rights experts count civilians killed and wounded, but know their tally falls significantly short. Neither Russia nor Ukraine has provided an updated accounting of their troop losses.Even the scope of the weaponry that Western countries have sent Ukraine is murky.Here’s a look at some of the numbers as Friday marks one year since Russian forces invaded Ukraine, with no end to the war in sight.THE EVOLUTION OF AN INVASIONRoughly 5,000 missile strikes, 3,500 airstrikes and 1,000 drone strikes: Firepower that Russia has launched against Ukraine over the past year, according to Brig. Gen. Oleksiy Hromov, a senior official in the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.18: The percentage of total Ukrainian land controlled by Russian forces as of Thursday, according to the Institute for the Study of War, a think tank. That’s down from 27% on March 23, before Ukrainian counteroffensives recaptured vast swaths of land — but up from the 7% held by Russia and Russia-aligned separatists before Feb. 24, 2022, as part of an armed rebellion in eastern Ukraine that began in 2014, and Russia's annexation of Crimea that year.71,905: Potential Russian war crimes — killings, kidnappings, indiscriminate bombings and sexual assaults — that are under investigation by Ukraine’s prosecutor-general. Reporting by The Associated Press and “Frontline,” recorded in a public database, has independently verified 639 incidents that appear to violate the laws of war.THE CASUALTIES8,006: Confirmed civilian deaths in Ukraine since Russia's invasion, through Feb. 15, according to the U.N. human rights office. The office uses strict methodology and says verification of thousands of reported casualties is still pending in Russian-occupied cities such as Mariupol, Lysychansk, and Sievierodonetsk.3,382: Civilian deaths in Ukraine recorded by the U.N. rights office for March 2022, the highest number for a single month of the war.13,287: Civilians injured in the conflict over the last year, according to the U.N.5,937: Russia's most recent count, from September, of its troops killed in Ukraine since February 2022.Around 200,000: Western Estimate of Russian troops killed and wounded.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820477,Tainan gets ready for super sweet 400th,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Tainan is set to celebrate its 400th birthday.In preparation for the event next year, the southern Taiwan city has established the “400 Years of Tainan” office, per CNA. The office will organize public activities and events to celebrate the highlights of Tainan’s 400-year history.Archeological evidence shows that the area in which Tainan now stands has been inhabited by humans for over 20,000 years, and until the 16th century, the indigenous Siraya tribe (西拉雅族) dominated the region. In 1624 Dutch colonists established Fort Zeelandia, and the city that we now know as Tainan was born.Nicknamed the Phoenix City, Tainan is Taiwan’s oldest, and was formerly the capital of the island. Today, cultural influences from various governments and settlers can be found throughout the city, from the local Indigenous cultures to Dutch, Japanese, and Chinese colonial architecture.Tainan Mayor Huang Wei-che (黃偉哲) said the city government is encouraging citizens to get involved, and that events will not be limited to just the arts, but will also display Tainan’s industries. Tainan’s Cultural Affairs Bureau has even partnered with local beermaker Typhoon Brewery to produce a commemorative craft beer for the celebration.",2023/02/24,1761,Society

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820489,MediaTek to Showcase its Groundbreaking Satellite Connectivity Technology at MWC 2023,"MediaTek is working to bring reliable connectivity everywhere with two-way satellite communications on smartphones and other devices

HSINCHU, Feb. 24, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- At MWC 2023, MediaTek will be demonstrating its innovative 3GPP Non-Terrestrial Network (NTN) technology that brings two-way satellite communications to smartphones. The first smartphones with MediaTek's satellite connectivity are also launching, with more devices to be unveiled in the coming months. Additionally, MediaTek will also be sharing a sneak peek of its next-generation 5G New Radio NTN (NR-NTN) technology for the next wave of satellite-enabled devices.

            Satellite networks aim to fill gaps in mobile coverage, offering a reliable way for devices to communicate in remote locations. With satellite-enabled smartphones, consumers can stay in touch when they are hiking, driving in secluded areas, on a boat, or in other situations where there has traditionally been no connectivity; this will not only provide users with peace of mind, but also enable them to request assistance in emergency situations. Today the biggest market opportunity for 3GPP NTN technology is smartphones, although there is a growing demand for satellite connectivity in IoT applications such as agriculture, forestry, and logistics. The automotive industry will also be a major market for satellite communications technology in the coming years.











            ""Two-way satellite communications on smartphones and other devices will usher us into a new era of connectivity and open up new possibilities across many different verticals,"" said JC Hsu, Corporate Vice President and General Manager of MediaTek's wireless communications business unit. ""Our standalone MT6825 chipsets, which are based on the 3GPP NTN open standard, can be integrated into any flagship smartphone to deliver a seamless satellite connectivity experience.""

            Over the coming years, MediaTek's satellite communications portfolio will target both IoT-NTN and NR-NTN technology based on the 3GPP 5G specification for Release 17 (R17). IoT-NTN is ideal for messaging since it is designed for low data rate connections, while NR-NTN allows for higher data rates that can support video calls and other applications. Since satellite networks can currently only support IoT-NTN on a mass scale, the initial wave of satellite-enabled smartphones and other devices powered by MediaTek will be designed for two-way satellite messaging services.

            MediaTek is teaming up with Bullitt to bring the world's first commercially available devices with 3GPP NTN technology, utilizing the MT6825 chipset to connect to the Bullitt Satellite Connect platform. This includes the motorola defy 2 and CAT S75 smartphones; and the motorola defy satellite link, a compact and lightweight Bluetooth accessory that allows Android and iOS devices to connect to the Bullitt Satellite Connect platform. Bullitt Satellite Connect service will provide users with access to two-way satellite messaging, location sharing, and emergency SOS in more places around the world.

            The forthcoming NR-NTN chipset from MediaTek will allow devices to support services with higher data rates like navigation and real-time communication. As satellite networks build capacity for NR-NTN over the coming years, this opens up exciting new consumer, enterprise, and industrial use cases as smartphones, IoT devices, and vehicles can take advantage of reliable connectivity everywhere.

            To make it easy for brands to integrate two-way satellite communications into smartphones and other devices, MediaTek's IoT-NTN solutions are standalone chipsets that can be added to any 4G or 5G device. The chipsets utilize the open 3GPP R17 NTN standard, unlike competing solutions which are based on proprietary solutions. For OEMs, the advantage of the standard is that once a device has been certified for 3GPP R17 IoT-NTN it can be used on any IoT-NTN compliant network. Additionally, mobile network operators can partner with service providers to offer roaming services or establish their own satellite networks that support the standard.

            In addition to the benefits of supporting 3GPP R17 NTN, MediaTek's MT6825 IoT-NTN chipset has a number of other features. MT6825 can connect to Geosynchronous Equatorial Orbit (GEO) constellations, which could be converted into 3GPP NTN compliant network easily and are widely available now on the orbit. To provide a seamless experience, MT6825 allows devices to automatically receive messages from satellites, unlike competitive solutions that require users to manually check for messages. The chipset has low system requirements, is very power efficient to provide greater battery life, and comes in a highly integrated design that helps accelerate time to market.

            For years MediaTek has been an active player in driving satellite connectivity innovation forward, serving as one of the main contributors to the 3GPP NTN specifications and working closely with other industry leaders to test and develop 5G NTN solutions.

            MediaTek is exhibiting at MWC in Barcelona, Spain from Feb. 27 through March 2, 2023. Attendees can see MediaTek's satellite connectivity demos by visiting MediaTek's booth in Hall 3, Stand 3D10.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820515,Beijing official in Hong Kong warns US envoy after speech,"HONG KONG (AP) — A Chinese diplomat accused the U.S. consul general in Hong Kong of interfering in its affairs after he said the city's freedoms were eroding and warned the American not to cross political “red lines.”

            Consul General Gregory May gave a video address last month in which he expressed concern over diminished freedoms in Hong Kong and said its reputation as a business center depended on adherence to international standards and the rule of law.

            The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Office in Hong Kong said its commissioner Liu Guangyuan met with May recently to express objections to his “inappropriate” words and deeds.











            “Liu also drew three red lines for US consul general and US consulate general in Hong Kong, which is not to endanger China’s national security, not to engage in political infiltration in Hong Kong, and not to slander or damage Hong Kong’s development prospect,” his office said in reply to inquiries from The Associated Press.

            Liu also urged May to abide by diplomatic ethics, the office added.

            An unidentified U.S. consulate spokesperson said that while they do not generally comment on private diplomatic meetings, they will not hesitate to express publicly or privately the United States' deep concern over the erosion of Hong Kong's autonomy.

            May, in his address to the U.S. Center for Strategic & International Studies, also cited a decision by China’s legislature that lets Hong Kong's executive branch decide whether foreign lawyers can be involved in national security cases in the city.

            The decision was made after the city's top court allowed pro-democracy publisher Jimmy Lai to hire a British lawyer to represent him as he fights collusion charges that could bring a life prison sentence if he is convicted.

            Liu's office accused May of slandering the rule of law and freedom in Hong Kong when he questioned the legal decision made in Beijing and other changes in Hong Kong's governance.

            The U.S. and other democracies have been critical of China’s crackdown on political freedoms in the former British colony, which was handed back to China in 1997 with a promise by Beijing to keep Western-style liberties under a “one country, two systems” framework.

            Hong Kong is among a raft of issues that have sent ties between Beijing and Washington to their lowest level in years, including technology and trade, human rights, threats against Taiwan, and China’s claims in the South China Sea.HONG KONG (AP) — A Chinese diplomat accused the U.S. consul general in Hong Kong of interfering in its affairs after he said the city's freedoms were eroding and warned the American not to cross political “red lines.”Consul General Gregory May gave a video address last month in which he expressed concern over diminished freedoms in Hong Kong and said its reputation as a business center depended on adherence to international standards and the rule of law.The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Office in Hong Kong said its commissioner Liu Guangyuan met with May recently to express objections to his “inappropriate” words and deeds.“Liu also drew three red lines for US consul general and US consulate general in Hong Kong, which is not to endanger China’s national security, not to engage in political infiltration in Hong Kong, and not to slander or damage Hong Kong’s development prospect,” his office said in reply to inquiries from The Associated Press.Liu also urged May to abide by diplomatic ethics, the office added.An unidentified U.S. consulate spokesperson said that while they do not generally comment on private diplomatic meetings, they will not hesitate to express publicly or privately the United States' deep concern over the erosion of Hong Kong's autonomy.May, in his address to the U.S. Center for Strategic & International Studies, also cited a decision by China’s legislature that lets Hong Kong's executive branch decide whether foreign lawyers can be involved in national security cases in the city.The decision was made after the city's top court allowed pro-democracy publisher Jimmy Lai to hire a British lawyer to represent him as he fights collusion charges that could bring a life prison sentence if he is convicted.Liu's office accused May of slandering the rule of law and freedom in Hong Kong when he questioned the legal decision made in Beijing and other changes in Hong Kong's governance.The U.S. and other democracies have been critical of China’s crackdown on political freedoms in the former British colony, which was handed back to China in 1997 with a promise by Beijing to keep Western-style liberties under a “one country, two systems” framework.Hong Kong is among a raft of issues that have sent ties between Beijing and Washington to their lowest level in years, including technology and trade, human rights, threats against Taiwan, and China’s claims in the South China Sea.",2023/02/25,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820516,Chiefs and Brumbies win Super Rugby Pacific openers,"CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand (AP) — The Hamilton-based Chiefs rallied from 10-0 down after 20 minutes to beat the defending champion Crusaders 31-10 Friday and pull off the first upset of the Super Rugby Pacific season in the opening match.

            In the late match at Sydney, the ACT Brumbies beat the New South Wales Waratahs 31-25. It was the Brumbies' 10th consecutive win over the Waratahs.

            Center David Havili scored the first try of the season in the 20th minute and the conversion which followed a penalty by Richie Mo’unga gave the Crusaders a 10-0 lead in front of a large home crowd at Christchurch.











            The Chiefs were able to stay in a mostly scrappy match and had cut the lead to 10-7 at halftime with a try to lock Brodie Retallick.

            Second-half tries to captain Sam Cane, center Alex Nankivell and replacement Cortez Ratima put the Chiefs ahead 31-10 after 70 minutes while the Crusaders mostly were locked in their own half or contained by the Chiefs’ defense.

            New rules applied this season to speed up the game produced a faster game, though often at the expense of structure and the Chiefs probably adapted more quickly than the Crusaders.

            Pressure to use the ball quickly from rucks probably helped the more spontaneous Chiefs more than the Crusaders, who were forced to make a large number of tackles in the second half and missed too many as they were outscored 24-0.

            “I thought we hung in there really well in the first half when we put ourselves under a bit of pressure,” Cane said. “I thought in the second half we got a lot of that right.

            “A lot of belief in this team. We feel like we’ve been building for a couple of years so it’s a good start to our season.”

            The Chiefs grabbed the lead in the 49th minute with Cane’s try and made the lead 21-10 when Nankivell dived over in the 60th.

            Ratima made an outstanding break from a scrum to score under the posts when the Crusaders were down to 14 men and flyhalf Damian McKenzie made all of his kicks to accentuate the Chiefs' advantage. 

            At Sydney, the Brumbies spoiled the Waratahs' return to their refurbished home stadium — it was their first match there in five years due to the renovations. Ryan Lonergan was the star for the Brumbies, scoring 16 of his side’s points, including the opening try.

            Waratahs' 18-year-old winger Max Jorgensen scored two tries in his Super Rugby debut.

            “P﻿retty proud of myself, “ Jorgensen said. “I’m not usually the nervous type of person but today I was pretty nervous.﻿”

            In matches Saturday to complete the first round, Moana Pasifika play Fijian Drua at Auckland and the Highlanders play the Blues at Dunedin, New Zealand. Also, the Queensland Reds take on the Hurricanes at Townsville, Australia, and the Western Force host the Melbourne Rebels at Perth, Western Australia.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820547,"German economy shrank by 0.4% in Q4, worse than 1st reported","BERLIN (AP) — The German economy shrank by 0.4% in last year's fourth quarter, the national statistics office said Friday, a sharp downward revision from its initial report that gross domestic product declined by 0.2%.

            The quarter-on-quarter contraction in the October-December period was the first since the first quarter of 2021. Consumer spending, which propped up growth in the first nine months of last year, dropped by 1% in the final three months of 2022. 

            Investment in construction and machinery showed bigger drops in the final quarter, the Federal Statistical Office said. 











            The full-year 2022 growth figure for Germany — Europe's biggest economy — remained at the 1.8% that the office reported at the end of January. 

            The economy has generally held up well, despite pressure from high inflation and fears last year of an energy crunch as Russia reduced and then cut off its gas supplies to Germany. That didn't materialize.

            On Wednesday, a closely watched survey showed German business confidence strengthening for the fourth consecutive month. That, however, was due entirely to an improvement in companies' outlook for the next six months. Their assessment of the current situation worsened slightly for the second consecutive month.

            That, coupled with weak consumer confidence and other factors, underlines expectations that the German economy will contract again in the current first quarter, ING economist Carsten Brzeski said.

            “Not falling off the cliff is one thing; staging a strong rebound, however, is a different matter,” he said in a research note. He added that industrial orders have been weakening for the past years, consumer confidence, “is still close to historic lows, the loss of purchasing power will continue in 2023, and the full impact of monetary policy tightening still has to unfold.”BERLIN (AP) — The German economy shrank by 0.4% in last year's fourth quarter, the national statistics office said Friday, a sharp downward revision from its initial report that gross domestic product declined by 0.2%.The quarter-on-quarter contraction in the October-December period was the first since the first quarter of 2021.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820548,Ukraine: Drone video shows cost of intense fighting in east,"MARINKA, Ukraine (AP) — The hulking Russian tank swiveled into position between the ruins of two pulverized apartment blocks, paused and fired, a ball of fire and fumes spewing from the muzzle of its cannon. 

            Just 12 seconds later, it fired again, unleashing another shell on its targets about 50 meters (yards) away on the other side of what had once been a street — many years ago, before fighting destroyed it.

            Although Friday marks the grim first anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, combat between Russian-backed forces and Ukrainian troops has raged in the country's east since 2014.











            The town of Marinka is among those that have been reduced to rubble. It is in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk province, where territory is roughly split between Russian and Ukrainian control. The front line runs through what is left of the town — which is very little.

            New video footage shot from the air with a drone for The Associated Press shows how particularly intense fighting since the Feb. 24, 2022, invasion has left no building in Marinka intact. Many are barely recognizable as buildings at all. Shell-fire has also made matchsticks of the town’s trees — many of them ripped apart at the trunk.

            Russian tank-fire, filmed Feb. 19, further added to the destruction, pounding what appeared to be Ukrainian positions amid the ruins. 

            Marinka's police chief, Artem Schus, describes his town as “completely destroyed.”

            Apart from soldiers, the town has been entirely evacuated “because there is no way for the civilian population to live there,” he told The AP in an interview.

            Still, dozens of townspeople have been killed and many wounded, he says.

            Schus believes that Russian forces are deliberately razing the ruins, blasting walls that still stand, to “destroy all cover, regardless of whether it is a civilian shelter or a military facility.”

            He adds: “They destroy everything because, with their tactics, they cannot defeat our troops, and resort to the destruction of all living things.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820550,Iran calls 84% uranium enrichment allegation a 'conspiracy',"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iranian state television on Friday offered an extended defense against an accusation attributed to international inspectors that it enriched uranium to 84% purity, with an official calling it part of a “conspiracy” against Tehran amid tensions over its nuclear program.

            The comments by Behrouz Kamalvandi, a spokesman for Iran's civilian nuclear program, sought to portray any detection of uranium particles enriched to that level as a momentary side effect of trying to reach a finished product of 60% purity — which Tehran already has announced it is producing. 

            However, uranium at 84% is nearly at weapons-grade levels of 90% — meaning any stockpile of that material could be quickly used to produce an atomic bomb if Iran chooses. Tehran has long insisted its program is for peaceful purposes, though the International Atomic Energy Agency, Western intelligence agencies and nonproliferation experts say Iran pursued a secret nuclear weapons program up until 2003. 











            The allegation that IAEA inspectors found 84% enriched uranium threatens to further escalate tensions between Iran and the West. Already, Israel's recently reinstalled Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has threatened military actions against Tehran. Meanwhile, Iran faced continued unrest Friday amid months of protests.

            Bloomberg first reported Sunday that inspectors had detected uranium particles enriched up to 84%. The IAEA, a United Nations nuclear agency based in Vienna, has not denied the report, saying only “that the IAEA is discussing with Iran the results of recent agency verification activities.” 

            In an interview with Iranian state television's English-language arm, Press TV, highlighted on Friday, Kamalvandi dismissed what inspectors may have found as “a particle of an atom that cannot be seen even under a microscope."" He described Iran's uranium centrifuge cascades as producing particles at varying purity that later form a final product of 60% enriched uranium. 

            “It doesn’t matter because the end product is what matters,” Kamalvandi said. “If we really want to enrich 20% more, we will announce it very easily. So it is clear that there is a conspiracy here.”

            Iran's 2015 nuclear deal limited Tehran's uranium enrichment to 3.67% — enough to fuel a nuclear power plant. The United States unilaterally withdrew from the accord in 2018. Since then, a shadow war between Israel and Iran has erupted across the wider Middle East. 

            Iran now produces uranium enriched to 60% purity — a level for which nonproliferation experts already say Tehran has no civilian use. Any accusation of enrichment higher than that further ratchets up tension over the program, something Iran has appeared to acknowledge through a series of comments this week about the allegation attributed to the international inspectors. 

            However, many questions remain over the allegations attributed to IAEA inspectors and Iran's explanation. 

            ""There are variances in enrichment levels but usually not the the degree Iran is claiming,"" said Daryl G. Kimball, the executive director of the Washington-based Arms Control Association. “Until the IAEA provides more information, including on the sampling and the methods of their analysis, we cannot be sure.”

            “It may also be possible that Iran is testing the political response to enrichment of very small amounts of uranium at higher levels, and closer to bomb grade, or, less likely, they got caught experimenting with new centrifuge cascade configurations and how quickly they could enrich uranium to higher levels.”

            While the IAEA’s director-general has warned Iran now has enough uranium to produce “several” nuclear bombs if it chooses, it likely would take months more to build a weapon and potentially miniaturize it to put on a missile. As recently as last March, the U.S. intelligence community assessed Iran “is not currently undertaking the key nuclear weapons-development activities that we judge would be necessary to produce a nuclear device.”

            Meanwhile late Thursday night, online videos showed explosions and anti-aircraft fire in Karaj, a city about 40 kilometers (25 miles) northwest of the Iranian capital, Tehran. Tracer rounds lit up the night sky, with the thud of blasts heard in the videos.

            Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency later attributed the activity to an unannounced drill at a base for the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard. In 2021, a suspected Israeli strike drone damaged a centrifuge assembly facility in Karaj.

            Also Friday, online videos showed weekly protests resuming around the city of Zahedan in Iran's restive southeastern province of Sistan and Baluchestan. Internet monitoring group NetBlocks reported “significant” disruptions to the internet around Zahedan as a prominent Sunni cleric issued a statement saying a live stream of his Friday sermon was disrupted. 

            In his sermon, the cleric Abdolhamid Ismaeelzahi told those in Iran's government “if you cannot solve the people's problems, leave and let someone come who can,"" activists said.DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iranian state television on Friday offered an extended defense against an accusation attributed to international inspectors that it enriched uranium to 84% purity, with an official calling it part of a “conspiracy” against Tehran amid tensions over its nuclear program.The comments by Behrouz Kamalvandi, a spokesman for Iran's civilian nuclear program, sought to portray any detection of uranium particles enriched to that level as a momentary side effect of trying to reach a finished product of 60% purity — which Tehran already has announced it is producing.However, uranium at 84% is nearly at weapons-grade levels of 90% — meaning any stockpile of that material could be quickly used to produce an atomic bomb if Iran chooses.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820567,"Israeli settlers shoot, wound 2 Palestinians in West Bank","JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli settlers shot and seriously wounded two Palestinians in the north of the occupied West Bank early on Friday, Palestinian health officials said, in what authorities describe as the latest incident in a wave of settler violence.

            The Palestinian Health Ministry said the two were being treated at a hospital in the village of Qusra, near the West Bank city of Nablus. It did not identify the men. 

            A group of armed settlers from a nearby outpost descended on the village and Palestinians went into the street to see what was happening late Thursday, said Ghassan Douglas, the Palestinian official who monitors Israeli settlements in the Nablus region. 











            After midnight, one of the settlers opened fire at the residents, hitting one man in the stomach and another in the thigh. Douglas said the shooting was unprovoked. 

            The Israeli army said soldiers arrived to disperse the confrontation. It said it was aware Palestinians were evacuated to a hospital with gunshot wounds. Israeli police said they were investigating. 

            Nablus was the scene of an Israeli military raid that set off a fierce gunbattle on Wednesday, killing 10 Palestinians, including two men aged 72 and 61, and a 16-year-old boy, and wounded scores of others. Palestinian militant groups claimed six of the dead as members.

            The bloodshed extended one of the deadliest periods in years in the West Bank, where dozens of Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire since the start of the year. Palestinian attacks on Israelis in 2023 have killed 11 people.

            Following Friday prayers at the Dome of the Rock Mosque in the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound in the Old City of Jerusalem, Palestinians chanted and protested against the deadly raid in Nablus, as well as a crackdown on Palestinian prisoners by Israel’s right-wing government. 

            The northern West Bank in particular has seen a surge of settler attacks. Many villages in the area have gradually become sandwiched between settlements and unauthorized outposts that house particularly ideological settlers.

            Last month, leading Israeli human rights group B'Tselem recorded a string of incidents near Nablus — from settlers attacking Palestinians with stones in Qusra to torching Palestinian cars in Aqraba. Earlier this month, a settler shot and killed a Palestinian in the farming town of Salfit. 

            “This kind of event we are now seeing here every few weeks,"" said Douglas, describing the settler violence as an attempt to push villagers off their land. 

            The United Nations recorded over 848 settler attacks against Palestinians in the West Bank last year, up from 538 in 2021. That includes property damage as well as physical assaults. The U.N.'s humanitarian office said it was the highest number it had recorded since 2006. So far this year, there have been 72 such attacks, it added. 

            Israel captured the West Bank, along with east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, in the 1967 Mideast war. Palestinians seek those lands for a hoped-for independent state. At least 700,000 Israeli settlers now live in dozens of settlements that spread across the West Bank and are protected by the Israeli military.JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli settlers shot and seriously wounded two Palestinians in the north of the occupied West Bank early on Friday, Palestinian health officials said, in what authorities describe as the latest incident in a wave of settler violence.The Palestinian Health Ministry said the two were being treated at a hospital in the village of Qusra, near the West Bank city of Nablus.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820568,Jill Biden voices kinship with Africans' fight for democracy,"NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — U.S. first lady Jill Biden said Friday that she feels a kinship with Africans during her sixth visit to the continent, telling The Associated Press in an exclusive interview that she wants to support nations fighting for democracy — “just like I feel we're doing in the United States.”

            “We cannot take things for granted, because it's such a precious system of government,"" she said. “We can't be complacent. We have to keep fighting for it.” 

            The first lady opened her trip earlier this week in Namibia, a young democracy, where on Friday she delivered a rousing speech to more than 1,000 students. She told them the democracy their parents and grandparents fought for is now theirs to defend and protect.











            In the interview, Biden said that when first lady Monica Geingos invited her to visit, “I thought there's no better place to go than to go to Namibia” to “encourage the youth to get involved, stay involved, fight for their democracy, just like I feel we’re doing in the United States.”

            Africa’s 54 countries are a mix of sometimes fragile democracies in places like Nigeria, which has an election this weekend; and more troubled nations like Burkina Faso, Guinea, Mali, Chad and Sudan that have seen coups in recent years; or Uganda, Gabon, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea and Cameroon, where presidents have been clinging to power for decades. Namibia gained its independence from South Africa in 1990. 

            American democracy was severely tested after President Joe Biden's election in 2020 when the incumbent, Donald Trump, repeatedly told lies about the election being stolen from him. Hundreds of his supporters who believed his conspiracy theories rioted at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, in a violent attempt to block Congress from certifying Biden as the new president in an unprecedented effort to thwart the customary peaceful transfer of power. 

            In her speech, Biden said women's and girls voices need to be more prominent in the debate about democracy.

            “As the first generation to be born into a free Namibia, the legacy that your parents and grandparents created is now yours — yours to defend and protect,” Biden told a largely student audience at Namibia University of Science and Technology. 

            “Yours to grow. And as we look forward, we must remember that the fight for democracy has no end.” 

            Biden later Friday moved on to Kenya, the second and final stop on her trip.

            She highlighted the plight of women and girls on her earlier stops in Namibia. In Kenya, she plans to use her stature to draw attention to a devastating drought across the Horn of Africa that is leaving people hungry and jeopardizing millions of lives. She had visited in 2011 during a severe famine. 

            “I’m hoping that, you know, that people do pay attention,"" Biden said in the AP interview. “To see the drought and what I saw before with, just, children who have no food and they can’t have livestock, they can’t grow crops and to be starving, and so I’m trying to really create awareness and, and just see how far things have come in the 10 years, really, that I’ve been gone.” 

            The first lady, who has spent time in more than a half dozen of Africa's countries, said she feels “really comfortable” on the continent. 

            “One thing I’ve learned is that each country is so different — the people are different, the culture is different, the religion is different, the language,” she said. “But, you know, we all share so many of the same values. 

            ""And I think that’s important, that we’re looking for stability, a stable government. We’re looking for, you know, representation of the people. We’re looking for leaders who have character and integrity, and that’s what I think we want to foster. And they do, too.” 

            She said the Biden administration is not “isolationist like we were becoming in the last administration,"" a reference to Trump and his America-first posture.

            “We are reaching out and saying, ’Hey, we’re a global society. Take our hands. Let’s do this together,” she said of the current administration. 

            Biden has worked with young people throughout a 30-year-long teaching career and said in her address to the students that they must exercise their rights to disagree and to dissent, to speak up when they see injustice and support leaders who listen to their concerns. 

            She noted that, in the United States, “we are still defending and strengthening our democracy, almost 250 years after our founding.” 

            “It's not easy. Democracy isn’t easy. It takes work,” she said during the rousing, rally-style speech. “But it’s worth it, because democracy delivers.”

            Afterward, she worked her way around the courtyard in a way that she rarely do to shake hands and pose for selfies with scores of excited students. They cheered at one point when she danced briefly to a drum-heavy African beat.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820607,German court rejects farmer's climate suit vs Volkswagen,"BERLIN (AP) — A German court on Friday rejected a farmer's bid to force automaker Volkswagen to end the sale of vehicles with combustion engines by 2030.

            In the case at the state court in the western town of Detmold, farmer Ulf Allhoff-Cramer said that drier soil and heavier rains because of climate change are harming his fields, cattle and commercial forests. 

            He argued that Volkswagen is partly to blame for that, as the mass production of vehicles running on gasoline contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere.











            The court ruled that the suit was unfounded. It said that it couldn't establish that the alleged damage to the plaintiff's property, health and rights could be remedied by the measures he demanded alone.

            Environmental group Greenpeace, which supports the case, has accused VW of relying on the arguments of climate change skeptics to avoid bringing forward its deadline for ending the sale of combustion engine vehicles from 2040.

            The automaker has objected to the farmer’s claim that it could be directly linked to any climate-related damages he has suffered. VW also pointed to its major effort to shift production to electric vehicles in the coming years.

            The head of Greenpeace Germany, Martin Kaiser, said that it would appeal the ruling. He said that the verdict was “disappointing.”

            Greenpeace already plans to appeal in another case in which a court in Braunschweig earlier this month dismissed another civil lawsuit demanding that VW stop selling vehicles with combustion engines by 2030.

            The man, identified as Halil Menci, was “neutralized” on Wednesday in an operation by the Turkish intelligence agency near the northern town of Qamishli, the Anadolu Agency reported. 

            The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition war monitor, said an airstrike by a Turkish drone on Wednesday killed a civilian and wounded a local Kurdish police commander. The drone attack occurred on a road linking Qamishli with the village Qahtaniya, it said.











            Rami Abdurrahman, who heads the Observatory said the civilian who was killed in the strike was known to smuggle people to Turkey. The man had, however, denied accusations by Turkish authorities that he smuggled into Turkey Ahlam Albashir, a Syrian woman who is accused of carrying out the attack. 

            The Nov. 13 bomb attack in Istanbul’s bustling Istiklal Avenue left six people dead, including two children. More than 80 others were wounded. 

            Turkish authorities blamed the attack on the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, as well as Syrian Kurdish groups affiliated with it. The Kurdish militants have denied involvement.

            
                At least 17 suspects have been jailed pending trial in connection with the attack, including Albashir who is accused of leaving the TNT-laden bomb on Istiklal Avenue. Officials said at the time that the attack’s planner had fled Turkey for Syria.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820609,"On Ukraine anniversary, EU pledges more support for refugees","VOULIAGMENI, Greece (AP) — European Union officials on Friday pledged continued support to millions of Ukrainian refugees, as they marked the anniversary of the Russian invasion. 

            “Ukraine can win this war, but we will be with Ukraine as long as it takes,” EU Home Affairs Commissioner Ylva Johansson told The Associated Press on the sidelines of a conference on migration near Athens. 

            Johansson urged members to conclude long-running negotiations to adopt new EU-wide migration rules and to assist Ukrainians who wished to return home but maintain their temporary residence status in the EU. 











            More than 8 million people have fled Ukraine since the start of the war, according to the United Nations refugee agency, and nearly 5 million have registered for EU temporary protection or similar national protection schemes in Europe. 

            Bartosz Grodecki, the Polish deputy interior minister, whose country has taken in the most refugees traveling westward since the start of the war, said his government was prepared to receive more people who could be displaced by a widely anticipated spring offensive by Russian forces in Ukraine. 

            “We have this contingency planning,” Grodecki told the AP. “I hope that it will not be necessary (but) ... we’ve been trained, planned properly, and we know how to be prepared.”

            Margaritis Schinas, the EU Commission vice president, said Russian President Vladimir Putin had failed in an effort to divide EU countries by applying pressure through high energy prices and migration.

            “This is a sad anniversary, but it’s also an opportunity to draw some lessons from these horrible 12 months we’re leaving behind,” Schinas told the AP. 

            “And as far as (refugees from) Ukraine are concerned, the figures are stable,” he said. 

            Schinas added that he didn’t think it was “automatic” that refugee numbers would increase in the coming months. 

            “If it happens, we are ready, but it doesn’t seem to be the case for the time being.” 

            The migration conference Friday was organized by Greece, Austria, Poland and Lithuania to discuss issues that include border management problems, including border wall construction. 

            Officials attending the conference observed a minute of silence for the victims of the war in Ukraine.VOULIAGMENI, Greece (AP) — European Union officials on Friday pledged continued support to millions of Ukrainian refugees, as they marked the anniversary of the Russian invasion.“Ukraine can win this war, but we will be with Ukraine as long as it takes,” EU Home Affairs Commissioner Ylva Johansson told The Associated Press on the sidelines of a conference on migration near Athens.Johansson urged members to conclude long-running negotiations to adopt new EU-wide migration rules and to assist Ukrainians who wished to return home but maintain their temporary residence status in the EU.More than 8 million people have fled Ukraine since the start of the war, according to the United Nations refugee agency, and nearly 5 million have registered for EU temporary protection or similar national protection schemes in Europe.Bartosz Grodecki, the Polish deputy interior minister, whose country has taken in the most refugees traveling westward since the start of the war, said his government was prepared to receive more people who could be displaced by a widely anticipated spring offensive by Russian forces in Ukraine.“We have this contingency planning,” Grodecki told the AP. “I hope that it will not be necessary (but) ... we’ve been trained, planned properly, and we know how to be prepared.”Margaritis Schinas, the EU Commission vice president, said Russian President Vladimir Putin had failed in an effort to divide EU countries by applying pressure through high energy prices and migration.“This is a sad anniversary, but it’s also an opportunity to draw some lessons from these horrible 12 months we’re leaving behind,” Schinas told the AP.“And as far as (refugees from) Ukraine are concerned, the figures are stable,” he said.Schinas added that he didn’t think it was “automatic” that refugee numbers would increase in the coming months.“If it happens, we are ready, but it doesn’t seem to be the case for the time being.”The migration conference Friday was organized by Greece, Austria, Poland and Lithuania to discuss issues that include border management problems, including border wall construction.Officials attending the conference observed a minute of silence for the victims of the war in Ukraine.",2023/02/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820610,2 Pakistani brothers home after release from Guantanamo,"ISLAMABAD (AP) — Two Pakistani brothers held by the United States at Guantanamo Bay detention facility for two decades were freed and returned home on Friday to be reunited with their families, officials said. 

            Pakistan arrested Abdul and Mohammed Rabbani on suspicion of links to al-Qaida in 2002 in Karachi, the country's southern port and largest city. That same year, Ramzi Binalshibh, a top al-Qaida leader, was arrested by Pakistan's spy agency Inter-Services Intelligence on a tip from the CIA.

            The Rabbanis' releases come months after a 75-year-old Pakistani, Saifullah Paracha, was freed from Guantanamo.











            The Foreign Ministry later Friday released a statement welcoming the brothers' release. 

            “We are pleased that these Pakistani nationals have finally reunited with their families,"" the ministry said, adding that it had “coordinated an extensive inter-agency process to facilitate repatriation"" of the two brothers.

            Earlier in the day, Pakistani lawmaker Mushtaq Ahmed Khan, chairman of the human rights committee in the upper house of Pakistan's Parliament, tweeted that the Rabbanis had landed at the Islamabad airport. 

            “There was no trial, no court proceedings, no charges against them. Congratulations on their release. Thank you Senate of Pakistan,"" Khan tweeted.

            Khan later told The Associated Press that the brothers were on their way to Karachi, the capital of southern Sindh province, where their families live. 

            The brothers' release was the latest U.S. move toward emptying and shutting down Guantanamo Bay. Former President George W. Bush's administration set it up to house extremist suspects after the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States.

            U.S. officials accused the brothers of helping al-Qaida members with housing and other logistical support. The brothers alleged torture while in CIA custody before being transferred to Guantanamo. U.S. military records describe the two as providing little intelligence of value, and that they did not recant statements made during interrogations on the grounds they were obtained through physical abuse.

            The U.S. Defense Department announced their repatriation in a statement Thursday.

            In Islamabad, Amina Masood Janjua, who heads the Defense of Human Rights Pakistan group, said the two were from an impoverished family. 

            “Their family members suffered a lot after their arrest and transfer to Guantanamo,"" she told the AP. 

            Janjua has been campaigning for the release of suspects arrested in Pakistan after the 9/11 attacks. She is the wife of Masood Ahmad Janjua, a businessman who went missing in 2005 in the garrison city of Rawalpindi. Since then, she has been fighting a legal battle for his release and that of others. 

            A close family friend of the Rabbanis told the AP on Friday that Pakistani authorities had formally informed the family about their imminent release and return to Pakistan. 

            The family friend, who is Pakistani and refused to be identified by name, fearing for his own safety, said the younger Rabbani learned painting during his detention at Guantanamo, and that he was expected to bring with him some of those paintings.

            He said Ahmed Rabbani frequently went on hunger strikes and that prison officials fed him through a tube. He said Ahmed remained on nutritional supplements up to his release.

            Guantanamo at its peak in 2003 held about 600 people considered terrorists by the U.S. Supporters of using the detention facility for suspected terrorists say that holding them prevented attacks. Critics say the military detention and courts subverted human rights and constitutional rights and undermined America's standing abroad.

            Thirty-two detainees remain at Guantanamo Bay, including 18 eligible for transfer if stable third-party countries can be found to take them, the Pentagon says. Many are from Yemen, considered too plagued with war and extremist groups and too devoid of services for freed Yemeni detainees to be sent there. 

            Nine of the detainees are defendants in slow-moving military-run tribunals. Two others have been convicted.

The class will also include practical experience, but only successful graduates will be allowed to catch iguanas in the region, so as not to break animal protection laws.The county is paying NT$50 ($1.63) to NT$550 per animal, depending on size.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820653,G20 finance summit: War in Ukraine takes center stage,"The war in Ukraine dominated as finance ministers from the Group of 20 (G20) leading economies kicked off their summit on Friday in the Indian technology hub of Bengaluru.During the meeting, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen reiterated US support for Ukraine and said that the United States ""will stand by Ukraine for as long as it takes.""Yellen used the forum to raise the issue of the war in Ukraine. She called out Russian officials attending the meeting and accused them of being ""complicit"" in the atrocities and damage the Russian invasion of Ukraine has caused.She urged G20 members to ""redouble their efforts to support Ukraine and restrict Russia's capacity to wage war.""Yellen also said that Russia's ""weaponization"" of food and energy has not only impacted Ukraine adversely but has also affected the global economy, particularly of developing countries.Leaders of the G7 democracies, who are also part of the G20, were expected to announce a new round of sanctions against those aiding Moscow's aggression against Ukraine.French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told Reuters news agencies that the summit must condemn Russia's war.Media reports said India, which holds the current G20 presidency, was seeking to block discussions about more sanctions against Russia. New Delhi has so far kept a neutral stance on the war.The summit host was reportedly also pressing to avoid using language such as the term ""war"" in the communique. Moscow has consistently referred to the invasion as a ""special military operation.""German Finance Minister Christian Linder has insisted that the summit's joint statement includes the term ""war.""""For a year we have been witnesses of this awful war in Ukraine started by Russia. And especially on a day like this, and at an occasion such as a G20 event, we need absolute clarity,"" Linder said.""This is a war. And this war has a cause, has one cause, and that is Russia and (Russian President) Vladimir Putin. That must be expressed clearly at this G20 finance meeting,"" Lindner told a news conference.At the summit, finance leaders and central bank chiefs will be discussing the issues such as inflation, digital currencies, World Bank reform, climate change and financial inclusion.In a video address, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, ""It is up to you, the custodians of the leading economies and market systems ... to bring back stability, confidence and growth to the global economy.""Although many economies have taken a hit since Russia's war in Ukraine started, the global outlook has demonstrated signs of improvement. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has forecast global GDP growth for this year at 2.9%, up from a 2.7% forecast in October.Yellen said the progress was partly thanks to cooperation among G20 central banks and governments taking strong action to quell inflation, even at the expense of growth.Discussions on global debt are also on the agenda. The US has long criticized China, the world's largest bilateral creditor, over what it considers to be ""foot-dragging"" on debt relief for dozens of low-and middle-income countries.China has urged the G20 to hold a fair and objective analysis of the question of global debt and resolve it in a comprehensive and effective manner.Beijing wants financial institutions and commercial creditors to follow the principle of ""joint action, fair burden"" in debt settlements, according to China's finance minister, Liu Kun.It was speculated that Liu would be meeting US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on the sidelines of the summit. However, China's Finance Ministry's statement confirmed that he joined the meeting virtually.fb, mf/rt (AP, Reuters)",2023/02/24,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820654,Ukrainians outraged as Russian lawmakers join Vienna talks,"Vienna's Hofburg palace complex gleams with all the splendor of a centuries-old former imperial residence. But the tourists milling about its cobbled squares seem unaware that this week that these gilded halls are playing host to guests deemed unwelcome by many.Six Russian lawmakers and three staffers are in town for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Parliamentary Assembly's annual winter meeting — and Vienna is now at the center of a political storm.The Austrian foreign ministry says it's legally bound to issue visas to Russian parliamentarians. In response, Ukrainian and Lithuanian delegations have refused to show up.A few minutes' walk away at the Ukrainian embassy, lawmaker Yevheniia Kravchuk is hosting an alternative assembly. Counterparts from Czechia and Poland pass by for hushed discussions and nationalities are on the invite list — but not Russian Duma members.""We don't think it's moral to sit with them in the same hall, because they have to be in a tribunal, not in such respectful meetings,"" Kravchuk told DW.That's a sentiment shared by Lithuanian lawmakers. Delegation head Vilija Aleknaite-Abramikiene told DW: ""It's impossible to follow business as usual.""The OSCE, which has 57 member states and 11 additional partners, is one of the few remaining organizations which still counts both Ukraine and Russia among its members. Kyiv has called for Moscow's expulsion, but its current rules of procedure make that unlikely.In a letter seen by DW dated February 1, members from more than 20 OSCE national delegations urged Austria to ""prohibit"" the participation of Russian delegates. But in a written statement, a foreign ministry spokesperson told DW that Austria must grant visas due to its unique status as OSCE host country. ""This is not a matter of political discretion, but a legal obligation,"" the spokesperson said.Kravchuk is not impressed. ""Of course, we can't explain and understand this decision no matter what Austrians would say,"" she said. ""You can always find a way not to be in the same room with war criminals.""The President of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly stressed that despite the glitzy palace venue, Russians were receiving no red-carpet treatment at the talks. ""I think they deserve to be here to listen when parliamentarians, country by country, are telling them that they are supporting Ukraine,"" Margareta Cederfelt told reporters.""It is up to the bodies like the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly to take up the Ukrainian causes in the political sphere and this is what we are doing,"" she said.Russians were given the floor on day one of the session. As lawmaker Vladimir Dzhabarov began speaking on Thursday, a walkout began.""With bitterness we observe how certain members of the Parliamentary Assembly, with shameful support of its chairman, are trying to transform a once effective instrument of inter-parliamentary diplomacy into a tool of totalitarian imposition of lies against Russia and Belarus,"" Dzhabarov told the emptying session. ""Thank you for cleaning up the atmosphere,"" he said as lawmakers filed out.Russia calls its war in Ukraine a ""special military operation"" and claims the conflict was provoked by the West.The political showdown around the talks has spotlighted the stance of militarily neutral Austria. The country is now home to 50,000 displaced Ukrainians and Vienna has provided hundreds of millions of euros in humanitarian support to Kyiv, while enacting EU-wide sanctions on Moscow.But Salzburg-based political scientist Reinhard Heinisch said this response is proving politically divisive at home, where historically there has been ""a great deal of skepticism toward the west and particularly the US.""""Then the war happened, and Austria tried to realign itself,"" Heinish added. ""The government is sort of caught between a rock and a hard place, trying to be as supportive of EU sanctions as they can be. At the same time, they don't want to irritate Russia more than they absolutely have to.""""Neutrality is a sacred cow, and if you ask Austrians, it's sort of what has made Austria safe, prosperous.""The dispute in Vienna is leading some to question the role of the OSCE's in today's world. The 57-member organization was created during the Cold War as a forum for East-West dialogue. Broad in scope, the OSCE has gone on to carry out tasks including election observation and ceasefire monitoring.Asked whether taxpayers' money was still being well spent on the organization, German lawmaker Michael Georg Link from the Free Democratic Party told DW: ""The OSCE PA has the unbeatable asset of bringing together parliamentarians from over 50 countries, in support of international law, human rights and international security. These efforts are well worth the investment.""Critics also say the timing of the winter meeting, which coincides with the one-year anniversary of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, is in bad taste. Asked about whether another date was considered, Parliamentary Assembly President Cederfelt cited rules of procedure on when meetings have to be scheduled.For Ukrainian parliamentarian Yevheniia Kravchuk, the anniversary brings up bad memories. ""Russians woke me up, woke my daughter up, with missiles and bombs.""""Most of the people that watch news about Ukraine and war probably think it's some sort of movie,"" she said.""It's not a movie. It's our everyday life.""Maria Katamadze contributed to this article.Edited by: Ruairi Casey",2023/02/24,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820655,"Estonia marks Independence Day with NATO, EU chiefs","Estonia's Prime Minister Kaja Kallas was joined by NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to mark the country's independence on Friday.The ceremony in the capital Tallinn came on the one-year anniversary of the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.After a wreath laying ceremony, the three leaders spoke on the occasion to reinforce EU and NATO unity and support for Ukraine.""Freedom is not free,"" Stoltenberg said. ""We must fight for it every day,"" citing lessons from Estonia's history.""There are no risk free options and the biggest risk of all is if Putin wins because the message to other authoritarian leaders would be they can get what they want through force,"" Stoltenberg added.""Supporting Ukraine is not just the morally right thing to do, it is also in our security interest.""Kallas noted that ""Today, Ukrainians are showing unprecedented resolve and courage."" She called on the EU to jointly procure ammunition and other defense materiel to aid Ukraine.""If we fall for Russia's threats, we will wake up in a much more dangerous world,"" she noted.Kallas added: ""The way this war in Ukraine ends will define peace for generations. For any peace to last, there must be accountability.""She was followed by von der Leyen who answered the call for joint EU defense procurement by thanking Kallas.""We will return to joint procurement to deliver urgent military supplies for Ukraine,"" von der Leyen said, citing the example of vaccine procurement during the COVID-19 pandemic as precedent for such a move.Stoltenberg said more aid to frontline states and states vulnerable to Russian aggression, such as Moldova, must be provided to prevent Russan aggression in the first instance. Of Putin, he assessed: ""He is not preparing for peace, he is preparing for more war so we must give Ukraine what they need.""He also dismissed China's posturing around a so-called peace plan released earlier in the week.""China does not have much credibility as they have not been able to condemn the invasion of Ukraine,"" Stoltenberg noted, adding, ""just a few days before the invasion, China signed a 'limitless partnership' with Russia.""Estonia, like Ukraine, was occupied by the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Since Estonia's independence in 1991, the country went on to join the EU and NATO in 2004, along with its Baltic neighbors Latvia and Lithuania.As a percentage of GDP, Estonia is the top donor to Ukraine with defense and humanitarian aid, according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy's Ukraine support tracker.Since the war's start in 2014, Estonia has repeatedly urged allies to support Ukraine and led the way since the full-scale invasion was launched one year ago.Ahead of the ceremonies marking independence and the anniversary of the invasion, Kallas told AFP: ""If this aggression pays off in Ukraine, then it serves as an invitation to use it elsewhere. We have to totally discredit the tool of aggression.""""So as long as they are fighting there, they are weakening the same enemy as we have,"" she added.By contrast, the deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council Dmitry Medvedev said Friday that Moscow must push back the country's borders as far as possible for lasting peace. In a message on social media, the former Russian president said he expected Moscow to be victorious and the war would end with a loose agreement.ar/rt (AFP, Reuters)",2023/02/24,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820662,Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy misjudged by Putin,"It's a world record. No leader before Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has managed to hold an address every single day for a straight year. The leader records video statements in his office, a bunker or elsewhere, chronicling the war against his country. The presidential addresses document how he and his country have changed since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion.On February 23, 2022, mere hours before Russia launched its attack on Ukraine, Zelenskyy recorded a special message to his compatriots and Russian nationals, trying to avert the conflict. He called on Russians to take to the streets in protest, and — speaking in Russian — also warned that ""if we are attacked, if there is an attempt to take our land, our freedom, our lives and that of our children, we will defend ourselves.""""If you attack, we will be facing you, we won't have our backs turned!"" he added. This was the last time the Zelenskyy faced the camera clean-shaven and wearing a suit and tie.Following the invasion by Russia, Zelenskyy and his government remained in Kyiv, even as Russian troops closed in on the capital's suburbs. This came as a surprise.Russian President Vladimir Putin had speculated that Zelenskyy would flee to western Ukraine or even abroad. Zelenskyy was reportedly offered help to evacuate, yet turned down the offer.The Associated Press news agency later quoted Zelenskyy as saying, ""I need ammunition, not a ride."" Although the retort has become legendary, it is difficult to verify whether he really said these words. Even still, the message was loud and clear, garnering sympathy abroad and emboldening his people's fighting spirit.In weeks prior to Russia's invasion, many Ukraine watchers had been puzzled by Zelenskyy's behavior. When Western intelligence agencies and state leaders warned of an impending Russian invasion and pulled embassy staff from Kyiv, the Ukrainian president reacted angrily, expressing distrust and criticism. Later, he revealed his reaction had been intended to stave off panic.Then, Russia's invasion changed everything.On the first day of the war, on February 24, Zelenskyy donned an olive green shirt. This military dress code has become his signature style, along with his five o'clock shadow. This is how the world has now come to know him; this is how he has appeared in countless interviews and on the covers of newspapers and magazines.On day two of the invasion, he recorded his most important and famous video. The 3 1/2 clip shows Zelenskyy along with the prime minister and other members of his leadership team outside Kyiv's presidential compound at night. It sent a strong message that everyone was still in Ukraine, willing to fight.Initially, Zelenskyy signaled openness to making concessions toward Russia, for instance regarding potential NATO membership. But when reports of Russian war crimes and the annexation of Ukrainian territory began surfacing, Zelenskyy hardened his stance, knowing most Ukrainians backed him.Over the last year, Zelenskyy has focused on what he does best: communicate. The camera is his sharpest weapon — he has shot videos in Kyiv, spreading hope, finding the right words and coming across as very authentic. He has repeatedly visited the front lines, meeting soldiers in places like liberated Izium, or besieged Bakhmut. Some of his clips feature footage recorded in Ukrainian cities devastated by the Russian army.Zelenskyy's approval ratings, which had plummeted before the invasion, shot up once fighting began and are currently hovering around 80% to 90%.How could Putin underestimate his Ukrainian counterpart so dramatically?Zelenskyy isn't a career politician, and his 2019 presidential election win came as a surprise. Before getting in politics, Zelenskyy was a successful comedian, actor and producer. He even performed once onstage in front of former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, who was visiting Ukraine.His political rise shows parallels to the satirical television series ""Servant of the People"", in which Zelenskyy starred as a teacher who later becomes head of state.It's for this reason that the Russian leadership didn't take Zelenskyy seriously, bristling when he refused to make major concessions.As a Russian-language comic, Zelenskyy often mocked Ukrainian ways and pro-Western politicians in the country. In fact, Zelenskyy went very light on Viktor Yanukovych, Ukraine's former pro-Russian president, during his time in office. Zelenskyy had close ties to Russia and earned money performing there even after Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula in 2014 — something that some of his compatriots found irksome.The invasion of Ukraine, however, changed everything. Zelenskyy's critics fell silent, and he won over many skeptics by remaining in Kyiv and not fleeing. This determination could be due to his upbringing.Zelenskyy grew up as the privileged son of a university professor in Kryvyi Rih, an industrial working-class city in southeastern Ukraine. Yet his generation faced the harsh, final years of the Soviet Union. Living though this time taught them not to shy away from conflict.When Putin attacked Ukraine, Zelenskyy could draw on this experience. The Russian leader underestimated his Ukrainian counterpart, treating him like an inexperienced weakling who could be easily defeated.This doesn't mean it has been all smooth sailing for Zelenskyy. His government has made mistakes: some leading politicians were forced to quit, and close friends of Zelenskyy lost their posts.The president sparked international anger when he claimed in November that a Russian missile had struck Polish territory and killed two people — yet according to US reports, the missile likely originated from a Ukrainian anti-aircraft battery.But this remains a rare disagreement between allies. Above all, Zelenskyy regards his primary job as using media attention to attract help for his country. Over and over, he has appealed to Western politicians, asking — some would say begging — for weapons. By and large, Zelenskyy has been successful, as more arms have been delivered to his country.And Zelenskyy is also a record-holder in terms of the number of video addresses to governments, conferences and festivals around the world, most recently addressing the assembled stars at the opening of the Berlinale film festival last week.This article was translated from German.",2023/02/24,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820664,"US commits $2 billion in drones, ammunition, aid to Ukraine","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Pentagon announced a new package of long-term security assistance for Ukraine on Friday, marking the first anniversary of Russia's invasion with a $2 billion commitment to send more rounds of ammunition and a variety of small, high-tech drones into the fight.

            The announcement comes just days after President Joe Biden made an unannounced visit to Kyiv and pledged America's continuing commitment to Ukraine. Biden told President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his people that ""Americans stand with you, and the world stands with you.”

            In a statement Friday, the Pentagon said the aid includes weapons to counter Russia's unmanned systems and several types of drones, including the upgraded Switchblade 600 Kamikaze drone, as well as electronic warfare detection equipment.











            It also includes money for additional ammunition for the High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, artillery rounds and munitions for laser-guided rocket systems. But, in an unusual move, the Pentagon provided no details on how many rounds of any kind will be bought. Including this latest package, the U.S. has now committed more than $32 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since Russia's invasion.

            Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement that the first anniversary of Russia's invasion is a chance for all who believe in freedom “to recommit ourselves to supporting Ukraine’s brave defenders for the long haul — and to recall that the stakes of Russia’s war stretch far beyond Ukraine.”

            Biden was scheduled to meet virtually Friday with other Group of Seven leaders and Zelenskyy “to continue coordinating our efforts to support Ukraine and hold Russia accountable for its war,” the White House said.

            Those efforts include what the White House called “sweeping” sanctions on over 200 people and entities “to further degrade Russia’s economy and diminish its ability to wage war against Ukraine.” The Biden administration will also further restrict exports to Russia and raise tariffs on some Russian products imported to the U.S.

            The White House statement released Friday also said, “G7 countries will continue to keep Russia’s sovereign assets immobilized until there is a resolution to the conflict that addresses Russia’s violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty and integrity.”

            Just days after Austin traveled to Kyiv in April 2022 to meet with Zelenskyy, he launched a now-monthly meeting of ministers of defense and defense chiefs to make sure momentum on assisting Ukraine does not fade. The most recent meeting was last week in Brussels, and over the past year the sessions have resulted in regular announcements by international partners of increasingly lethal weapons systems to help Ukraine defend itself.

            That effort also spawned a spin-off group of the chief weapons buyers for each partner nation. They now meet regularly to address the pressure that support for Ukraine has put on international weapons stockpiles, to make sure equipment continues to flow and manufacturing meets the demands.

            Allies and partners, said Austin, have committed more than $20 billion in security assistance to Ukraine, including tanks, armored vehicles, air-defense systems, artillery systems and weapons.

            “Difficult times may lie ahead, but let us remain clear-eyed about what is at stake in Ukraine,” Austin said, “to ensure that a world of rules and rights is not replaced by one of tyranny and turmoil.""

            The latest aid package uses the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative to provide funding for longer-term contracts to buy weapons and equipment. Unlike the presidential drawdown authority that the Pentagon has used repeatedly over the past year to pull weapons from its own stocks and quickly ship them to Ukraine, the USAI-funded equipment could take a year or two to get to the battlefront. As a result, it will do little to help Ukraine prepare for an expected new offensive in the spring.

            According to the Pentagon, the money will also buy mine clearing and communications equipment and fund training, maintenance and sustainment for Ukraine’s forces.

            On CNN Thursday night, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan confirmed that Biden and Zelenskyy discussed Ukraine’s request for F-16 fighter jets during the U.S. president’s visit week to Kyiv.

            “They’re about to mount a significant counter offense,” Sullivan noted, referring to expectations that Ukraine will mount a spring offensive. “From our perspective, F-16s are not the key capability for that offensive.” He suggested, however, that the F-16 request could be revisited for long-term defense.WASHINGTON (AP) — The Pentagon announced a new package of long-term security assistance for Ukraine on Friday, marking the first anniversary of Russia's invasion with a $2 billion commitment to send more rounds of ammunition and a variety of small, high-tech drones into the fight.The announcement comes just days after President Joe Biden made an unannounced visit to Kyiv and pledged America's continuing commitment to Ukraine.

To prevent the fire from spreading further in the mountains, the airborne service corps joined the firefighting effort by deploying a helicopter to drop water where hoses could not reach.Meanwhile, near the Dayan Village fire were three cell towers and a shack. To prevent the fire from reaching them, firefighters called for the airborne service corps to deploy a helicopter in the hopes that it would speed up the firefighting process.At the time of publishing, no injuries had been reported.",2023/02/24,1005,Environment
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820674,"California could face floods, blizzards from huge US storm","LOS ANGELES (AP) — A coast-to-coast storm that paralyzed roads and blacked out nearly 1 million homes and businesses was set to pound California on Friday, sparking warnings about floods and blizzards.The National Weather Service warned of a “cold and dangerous winter storm"" through Saturday. As much as 5 feet (1.5 meters) of snow could fall in some mountains near Los Angeles, which could create whiteout conditions as winds gust to 75 mph (120 kph) and an increased risk of avalanches, forecasters said.The weather service issued rare blizzard warnings for Southern California mountain areas and urged drivers to avoid dangerous roads.Storms already have battered the Plains states and northern regions of the country for days and the National Weather Service predicted continuing problems from ice, snow and freezing rain into the weekend.In the Pacific Northwest, much of Oregon’s largest city was shut down after almost a foot (30 centimeters) of snow fell unexpectedly. It took drivers in Portland by surprise, stalling traffic during the Wednesday evening rush hour and trapping motorists on freeways, some of whom spent the night in their cars.Maia Foley-Weintraub’s 5-year-old son had to spend the night at daycare because she was stuck in snow-stalled traffic for nine hours. In a moment of panic during that time, her van slid down an icy hill, forcing her to use the emergency brake. It took her until 2 a.m. Thursday to make it home safely.“People were just spinning out and getting stuck left and right,” she said. “It was just one thing after another. I did not have any idea that that was going to turn out the way it did.”The snow began to melt later in the day but as temperatures dropped and night fell, roads became slick with black ice.Portions of Interstate 80 in California and Wyoming were closed because of impassable conditions. That included about a 70-mile (112-kilometer) stretch over the top of the Sierra Nevada linking California and Nevada.The weather also knocked out power to nearly 1 million homes and businesses in multiple states and closed dozens of schools. Weather also contributed to airport snarls. At one point on Thursday, more 2,000 flights were grounded and nearly 14,000 were delayed across the country, according to the tracking service FlightAware.com.Widespread power outages were reported in Michigan, Illinois, California, New York and Wisconsin, according to the website PowerOutage.us.The largest outages by far were in Michigan, where at one point more than 820,000 customers were without electricity, mostly in the state’s southeast corner. Some 3,000 power lines were knocked down after being coated with ice as much as three-quarters of an inch thick and crews were struggling to get the juice back by the end of Sunday, utilities said.“Utilities across the country fear ice storms like we fear nothing else,"" said Trevor Lauer, president of DTE Electric. “We’ve not had an ice storm in the last 50 years that has impacted our infrastructure like this.”A Michigan firefighter died Wednesday after coming in contact with a downed power line in the village of Paw Paw, authorities said.Winter storm warnings remained in effect in northern Michigan and parts of New England could see sleet, snow and freezing rain as a cold front stretched from the eastern Great Lakes to East Texas, the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center said.But the weather front was creating vastly different conditions in different parts of the country.“Southerly flow ahead of the front is creating mild and warm conditions for much of the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic while northwesterly winds behind the front are pushing cold arctic air into the Plains and Upper Midwest,” the weather service said.Usually balmy California saw unusual winter weather.Karen Krenis was driving to a pottery studio in Santa Cruz in the San Francisco Bay area on Thursday when she stopped in her tracks after seeing snow on the beach. She got out of her car and went to take photos. By the time she left, about 50 other people were there. Adults were snapping photos, and children were making snowballs.“I have lived in California for 30 years, and I’ve never seen anything like it,” Krenis said.In Southern California, the storm began moving Thursday with widespread rain and some snow flurries. There was even a dusting of snow or graupnel — a sort of soft hail — Thursday morning in the hills near the Hollywood sign, although it quickly vanished.Flood watches and warnings were in effect through Saturday afternoon for some coastal regions and valleys, and the potential for heavy rainfall causing flooding and debris flow in some areas burned by wildfires in recent years.Evacuation warnings also were issued in Ventura County for four areas that were considered unstable after being hit hard by storms last month.The weather service said temperatures could drop far below normal in the region. That posed a special risk to thousands of homeless people, with shelter space limited and freezing temperatures expected in some areas.Terry Stephens, who lives in a trailer with her son and his girlfriend in Palmdale, was temporarily placed in a hotel room in the Antelope Valley city northeast of Los Angeles after shivering through the night on Wednesday.“It was frigid; your bones ache and you can’t get warm,” she told the Los Angeles Times. “I had three blankets on me last night and I was still freezing. Nothing helped.”___Associated Press writer Andrew Selsky in Salem, Oregon, Olga Rodriguez in San Francisco, Ed White in Detroit and other AP reporters from around the country contributed to this report.",2023/02/24,207,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820675,World Baseball Classic in Japan to still feature masks,"TOKYO (AP) — Fans of the upcoming World Baseball Classic are going to see two versions, depending whether the games are in the United States or Taiwan, or in Japan.In the United States and Taiwan, fans can cheer and need not wear masks. Taiwan dropped most of its mask mandates this week.For Japan, it’s slightly more complicated as COVID-pandemic rules are changing more slowly. Cheering will be allowed, but masks will be worn at the Tokyo Dome.The first three days of play in the WBC are March 8-10 in Taiwan and Japan. Play begins on March 11 at the two U.S. sites in Miami and Phoenix.The tournament, featuring 20 national teams, ends on March 21 in Miami. The powers from Asia will be Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Australia.Latin America will feature the largest contingent with Colombia, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Venezuela, Panama and Nicaragua. The United States and Canada have also entered strong teams.After almost three years of strict COVID-19 rules, traditional cheering returned to this week during preseason games for Nippon Professional Baseball. That included the drum-beating, trumpet-playing, and constant singing that characterizes the game in Japan.The Japan national team training for the WBC will play warm-up games this weekend and avid cheering will also be encouraged.However, masks will still be worn.“I expect a situation where fans will be able to cheer while wearing masks,” NPB General Secretary Atsushi Ihara told Japan’s Kyodo News recently. He was speaking about the upcoming Japanese season.The Japanese government is expected to relax the mask-wearing guidelines on March 13, leaving many mask-wearing choices up to the individual.WBC play in Japan ends on March 16, but the policy change is not expected to touch the tournament with masks still being worn.The shift away from masks has been slow in Japan, where much of the public donned masks even before the pandemic. Few Japanese go without masks, even in outdoor areas like parks and broad sidewalks.The government policy announced on March 13 will still recommend mask-wearing for crowded indoor settings -- the WBC venue the Tokyo Dome is indoors -- commuter trains, and hospitals.Businesses will also be allowed to ask customers to wear masks.—-More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/02/24,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820680,The calculus of war: Tallying Ukraine toll an elusive task,"GENEVA (AP) — Quantifying the toll of Russia's war in Ukraine remains an elusive goal a year into the conflict.Estimates of the casualties, refugees and economic fallout from the war produce an incomplete picture of the deaths and suffering. Precise figures may never emerge for some of the categories international organizations are attempting to track.U.N. human rights experts count civilians killed and wounded, but know their tally falls significantly short. Neither Russia nor Ukraine has provided an updated accounting of their troop losses.Even the scope of the weaponry that Western countries have sent Ukraine is murky.Here’s a look at some of the numbers as Friday marks one year since Russian forces invaded Ukraine, with no end to the war in sight.THE EVOLUTION OF AN INVASIONRoughly 5,000 missile strikes, 3,500 airstrikes and 1,000 drone strikes: Firepower that Russia has launched against Ukraine over the past year, according to Brig. Gen. Oleksiy Hromov, a senior official in the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.18: The percentage of total Ukrainian land controlled by Russian forces as of Thursday, according to the Institute for the Study of War, a think tank. That’s down from 27% on March 23, before Ukrainian counteroffensives recaptured vast swaths of land — but up from the 7% held by Russia and Russia-aligned separatists before Feb. 24, 2022, as part of an armed rebellion in eastern Ukraine that began in 2014, and Russia's annexation of Crimea that year.71,905: Potential Russian war crimes — killings, kidnappings, indiscriminate bombings and sexual assaults — that are under investigation by Ukraine’s prosecutor-general. Reporting by The Associated Press and “Frontline,” recorded in a public database, has independently verified 639 incidents that appear to violate the laws of war.THE CASUALTIES8,006: Confirmed civilian deaths in Ukraine since Russia's invasion, through Feb. 15, according to the U.N. human rights office. The office uses strict methodology and says verification of thousands of reported casualties is still pending in Russian-occupied cities such as Mariupol, Lysychansk, and Sievierodonetsk.3,382: Civilian deaths in Ukraine recorded by the U.N. rights office for March 2022, the highest number for a single month of the war.13,287: Civilians injured in the conflict over the last year, according to the U.N.5,937: Russia's most recent count, from September, of its troops killed in Ukraine since February 2022.Around 200,000: Western Estimate of Russian troops killed and wounded. Britain’s Ministry of Defense has estimated 40,000-60,000 Russian troops have died fighting in Ukraine.9,000 : Ukraine's most recent count, of its troops losses since the invasion provided in August by Gen. Valerii Zaluzhnyi, commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian armed forces.More than 100,000: Estimate of Ukrainian troops killed or wounded, according to Western officials.REFUGEES AND DISPLACED PEOPLE8.1 million: Refugees who fled Ukraine after the Russian invasion, based on figures provided by national governments. The number includes more than 5.2 million in over 40 European and central Asian countries, including nearly 1.6 million in Poland, over 880,000 in Germany and nearly 2.9 million who went to Russia, according to U.N. refugee agency UNHCR.5.4 million: People who were driven from their homes but stayed inside Ukraine, according to a Jan. 23 count by the International Organization for Migration. The number of internally displaced people peaked in early May 2022, when IOM reported there were more than 8 million.5.6 million: Ukrainians who have returned to their homes, either from within Ukraine or abroad, according to the latest IOM figures.17.6 million: People in Ukraine needing humanitarian aid, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.ECONOMIC COST$138 billion: The total damage caused to Ukraine’s infrastructure due to the war, according to the latest Kyiv School of Economics figure from Jan. 24.33%: Minimum drop in Ukraine’s gross domestic product in 2022 expected by the International Monetary Fund. Final numbers are pending.2.2%: Expected decline in Russia’s GDP in 2022, according to the IMF.30%: Decline in the value of Ukrainian exports in 2022, as reported by the World Trade Organization16% : Increase in the value of Russian exports in 2022, according to the WTO. It noted that the volume of Russian exports may have declined slightly, but the value was up because of price increases for fuels, fertilizers and cereals that Russia produces.INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT FOR UKRAINE$113 billion: Emergency funding for the Ukraine response approved by U.S. Congress last year. Includes about $62 billion to be provided through the Defense Department, nearly half of it for weapons, training and other “direct security assistance,” and $46 billion through the State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development, according to the Pentagon and an inter-departmental report issued last month.$78 billion: Total U.S. commitments made directly to Ukraine over most of last year and through Jan. 15, according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy. The Germany-based institute says its figure excludes funds that were over-reported, have gone unused, or actually go to Ukraine's neighbors or to U.S. domestic programs. Its tally doesn't include more recent U.S. pledges to Ukraine, such as for 31 M1 Abrams tanks.$59 billion (55 billion euros): Total commitments to Ukraine from European Union member nations and EU institutions, according to IFW Kiel.$14 billion (13 billion euros): Pledges and allocations from non-country donors, including the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.50%: Rough estimate by IFW-Kiel of aid disbursed as a percentage of commitments made by various donors.___Hanna Arhirova in Kyiv, Ukraine, contributed to this report.___Follow AP's coverage of the war in Ukraine: https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",2023/02/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820681,Workers dig by layers in search for 47 missing at China mine,"ALXA LEAGUE, China (AP) — Work crews trying to find 47 people missing after a collapse at an open-pit mine in northern China have had to change their excavation methods to avoid causing more landslides, state media reported Friday.Six people have been confirmed dead and six injured people have been rescued at the mine in Inner Mongolia’s Alxa League as of Thursday night, broadcaster CCTV said.With a large collapsed area at the mine, the digging done by backhoes and bulldozers can risk more collapses. The crews are excavating by layers and making trapezoid-shaped descents to carry on their search from both sides of the mountain in an adjustment of their rescue plans, the report said.On Friday, heavy machines were seen working on the top level of the collapsed site, searching for trapped vehicles and missing persons.“It is very challenging to conduct rescue work,” Li Zhongzeng, head of Alxa League in Inner Mongolia, told CCTV. “Rescue workers from everywhere, including those in neighboring regions, are rushing to the site.”The initial cave-in of one of the pit’s walls occurred at about 1 p.m. Wednesday, burying people and mining trucks below in tons of rocks and sand. A brief video of the collapse posted on the website of the Beijing Times showed a massive wall of reddish dirt or sand rushing down a slope onto mining vehicles moving below.A subsequent landslide about five hours later halted rescue efforts before they resumed Thursday.CCTV said 1,160 rescuers were currently at the scene. They were seen using heavy machines, shovels and rescue dogs in their search for miners.Chinese President Xi Jinping has called for an “all-out” search-and-rescue effort.Wang Xiangxi, minister of emergency management, said authorities should investigate the disaster and hold accountable anyone who was responsible for it.Authorities in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region also issued an urgent notice asking all districts to perform safety checks and eliminate any hidden risks, according to a local state newspaper. Those who do not comply with the request and cause accidents will be held accountable, it added.On Friday, security remained tight at a checkpoint between Inner Mongolia and the neighboring region of Ningxia, with two police officers in yellow vests checking vehicles that were trying to get past what one of them called a “restricted” area.Some trucks were turned away from proceeding further, but others including one emergency services vehicle driving very fast with a siren blaring and a truck carrying rescue supplies were let in. The checkpoint appeared quieter compared to a day ago.The company running the mine, Inner Mongolia Xinjing Coal Industry Co. Ltd., was fined last year for multiple safety violations including insecure routes, unsafe storage of volatile materials and a lack of safety training, according to the news website The Paper.Inner Mongolia is a key region for mining of coal, minerals and rare earths that critics say has ravaged the region’s landscape of mountains, grassy steppes and deserts.China overwhelmingly relies on coal for power generation but has tried to cut the number of deadly mine accidents through a greater emphasis on safety and the closure of smaller operations that lacked necessary equipment.___Associated Press news assistant Caroline Chen in Inner Mongolia contributed this report.",2023/02/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820682,Fight on: It's all USC can do to end baseball's long drought,"Twenty-five years have passed since Southern California won its 12th, and most recent, national title in baseball.

            Once the gold standard, the Trojans are two decades into a down cycle that has seen the program go through four coaches since Mike Gillespie, the last tie to the glorious Rod Dedeaux era, was forced out.

            Since 2006, USC has made the NCAA Tournament once and has had a winning record in Pac-12 play just twice. The Trojans finished last in 2022 and are picked 10th in coach Andy Stankiewicz's first year.











            “It’s been disappointing, to say the least, to see what’s happened,"" said former major league star Fred Lynn, one of the program's beloved figures who won national titles all three years he was with the Trojans in the 1970s.

            “I'm a glass-half-full guy and hopeful things can turn around. I don’t want to look at the standings of wherever we’re playing — the Pac-12, Big Ten — and see us at the bottom. That's so foreign to me and hard to watch.”

            Stankiewicz — who appeared in 429 games in seven seasons in the majors with the New York Yankees, Houston, Montreal and Arizona — expects to have the program on an upward trajectory by the time the Trojans and crosstown rival UCLA begin playing in the Big Ten in two seasons. With their inherent recruiting and weather advantages, both should challenge for titles every year in their new conference.

            The 58-year-old Stankiewicz has a deep understanding of USC's traditional place in college baseball — the Trojans have twice as many national titles as any other school — and he appears to be an ideal fit.

            He grew up in suburban Los Angeles and watched as Dedeaux stacked up the last of his 11 national titles in the 1970s. He had hoped to play for the Trojans, but it was Pepperdine that offered a scholarship.

            “I was on the outside looking in and you’re always asking, ’What's it like to play for Coach Dedeaux?''' he said. “Then you’re playing against Mark McGwire and Randy Johnson at Dedeaux Field, this iconic ballpark. You wanted to beat them because you’re competitive, but you also knew this place was pretty special.”

            His only other college head coaching job was at Grand Canyon, which he led to five Western Athletic Conference titles since 2015 and two NCAA Tournaments.

            “I loved Grand Canyon — they gave me an opportunity to be a head coach — but if ever there was a place intriguing to me as one day possibly coaching, it was SC,” Stankiewicz said.

            The Trojans brought back 19 players, including the top two starting pitchers and three everyday players. Stankiewicz's top priorities were to earn the trust of players through the summer and fall practices and ramp up recruiting. 

            He hired an impressive staff, including a connection to better times in pitching coach Seth Etherton. He pitched on the 1998 national championship team and was that season's national player of the year. 

            “One thing that has gotten lost over the years was the young men understanding the legacy of the players who put USC on the map, from Rod Dedeaux to the Fred Lynns,” Etherton said. “It’s necessary for me to give these guys a history of USC baseball, have them understand what it means to put this logo on your hat and on your jersey. It’s the greatest program in the history of college baseball, and it’s really not even close compared to anyone else.”

            The Trojans opened the season with a three-game sweep of Marist before losing a mid-week game to UC Irvine. 

            They head to Auburn this weekend to play a Tigers team that has appeared in two of the last three College World Series. It will be a measuring-stick series for the Trojans.

            Why did the Trojans fall so hard?

            Andy Lopez, a College Baseball Hall of Fame coach and Pac-12 Network analyst, points to two factors.

            First, the start of the decline coincided with UCLA's hiring of John Savage in 2005. The Bruins capitalized on the controversial firing of Gillespie in 2006 and established themselves at the top of the Los Angeles area's college baseball power structure, winning the 2013 national title.

            Second, the Trojans swung and missed on their attempts to make splash hires and stayed in-house for the first three coaches after Gillespie. Chad Kreuter, Gillespie's son-in-law, had losing seasons all four of his years. Frank Cruz was elevated from interim coach and fired after two seasons for violating NCAA rules.

            Dan Hubbs, Cruz's associate head coach, was promoted and lasted seven years. USC then went outside to hire Jason Gill from Loyola Marymount. Gill's three seasons were marred by the school's investigations into his treatment of players and possible NCAA violations.

            “Good baseball guys,"" Lopez said, ""but probaby not the right hire at the time when John Savage was at UCLA.”

            Lopez said he thinks Stankiewicz is the right guy and that the Trojans' timetable for improvement could be accelerated with the move out of the Pac-12.

            “It’s going to be the Big Ten and you’re going to be fine there,” Lopez said he told him in a phone call after his hiring. “You're still going to have John at UCLA, but when you look at that conference, you're going to be OK.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820684,Illinois governor plan targets kids' mental health crisis,"SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) — A mental health crisis among children in Illinois will be fought by streamlining and easing access to necessary treatment and coordination between six separate state agencies, Gov. J.B. Pritzker announced Friday.

            In the works for nearly a year, the study examined the capacity and condition of Illinois’ response to behavioral health in young people. It sketches avenues to help families first to understand mental illness, then makes it easier for them to get required care without navigating what Pritzker called the “serpentine” paths of disparate state agencies.

            “Government doesn’t work very well between silos of one department and another,” Pritzker said at a school in the Chicago suburb of Maywood. “People feel like they have territory that they need to protect. And the fact is that our territory is all of the children of the state of Illinois.”











            The mental health of children nationwide rapidly unraveled during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2021 found 44% of American children had depressive episodes lasting at least two weeks and nearly half had thought about suicide, according to the report. 

            Lawmakers and advocates were impressed by the number of agencies working together.

            “You think of a parent who’s in crisis at their wit’s end ... having to call each and every one of these agencies and trying to keep track of it,” said Senate Public Health Committee Chairperson Karina Villa, a West Chicago Democrat. “All they want is to get their baby the help that they need. Now we have a blueprint as to how they’re going to be able to do that.”

            The report identifies technological, practical, legislative and other means for marshaling the expertise among the Departments of Human Services, Children and Family Services, Juvenile Justice, Healthcare and Family Services, Public Health and the State Board of Education.

            The report’s authors were a team led by Dana Weiner, on loan from the Chapin Hall Center for Children at the University of Chicago, where she is senior policy fellow.

            “What families (should) experience is a simplified, centralized, clear way to get access to services to understand what their children are struggling with and to identify the things that might help address those challenges,” Weiner said.

            Friday’s announcement marks the beginning of work to ready the plan for implementation, a report on which Pritzker expects by October. There’s $22.8 million in the governor’s fiscal 2024 budget proposal to complete the planning.

            The ranking Republican on the Senate Behavioral and Mental Health Committee, Terri Bryant of Murphysboro, said she's pleased a plan is underway, adding her main focus will be ensuring sufficient treatment space, particularly in southern Illinois where she lives. 

            Bryant said she was called recently to help find space for a 14-year-old boy from Arkansas who was violent toward the aunt who took custody of him. None was available and the boy was housed in a hospital emergency room for three weeks.

            The report notes that 80,000 children under age 18 lives in areas of the state lacking necessary outlets. It identifies calculations that will be used to ensure equitable distribution of needed bed space.

            Early awareness of mental health problems is critical too, Weiner said. The U.S. Surgeon General discovered in a 2021 study that on average, there is an 11-year gap between recognizing a child’s potential mental health issue and that child getting treatment. The report recommends widespread screening of young children which might telegraph future problems. 

            Like bed space, the report recognizes that worker shortages across industries will severely impact the mental health care program. It says the government must provide incentives, both in making education more attainable but also drawing upon paraprofessionals or aides to conduct critical work which doesn’t need extensive formal education. 

            Democratic Senate Majority Leader Kimberly Lightford of Maywood noted the planned outreach to help parents understand troubling signs which are often “overlooked or minimized by adults, believing that these struggles are something their child can overcome on their own.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820685,"Blinken heads to Asia, with China, Russia tensions soaring","WASHINGTON (AP) — Fresh from a meeting with China’s top diplomat and a U.N. Security Council session on Ukraine, Secretary of State Antony Blinken will travel to Central and South Asia next week for international talks that will put him in the same room as his Chinese and Russian counterparts.

            The State Department said Blinken would travel to the former Soviet republics of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan before going to India for a meeting of the Group of 20 foreign ministers from the world’s largest industrialized and developing countries, including China and Russia.

            The trip comes as tensions have soared between the U.S. and Russia and between the U.S. and China over Russia's war in Ukraine and Chinese assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific. All three countries are competing fiercely to outdo each other in global influence.











            Underscoring the challenges the U.S. faces, the three countries Blinken will visit were all among the 32 nations that abstained in Thursday's U.N. General Assembly vote that condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine by a vote of 141-7.

            “It’s clear to us that the countries of Central Asia and India have had long, complex relations with Russia,"" said Donald Lu, the top U.S. diplomat for the region, on Friday. “I don’t think they’re going to end those relations anytime soon, but we are talking to them about the role they can play in this conflict.”

            Lu added: “We may not share the same approach every day on Ukraine, but I think we do share the goal that this conflict ends and it ends based on principles in the U.N. charter.""

            U.S. officials have been tight-lipped about the prospects for Blinken sitting down with Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang or Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in New Delhi. But all three will be present in the Indian capital for the G-20 meeting. 

            “A major multilateral summit like the G-20, of course, lends itself to the potential for bilateral engagements on the margins, but we don’t have any specific scheduling updates to offer,” deputy State Department spokesman Vedant Patel said. He added, though, that “the United States believes it’s important to keep the lines of communication open.”

            The last time the G-20 foreign ministers met — in Bali, Indonesia, in 2022 — Blinken held extensive talks with China’s then-foreign minister, Wang Yi, that led to a summit between President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Xinping in November. 

            And Wang, who has since been promoted, met with Blinken last weekend on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference in Germany, the first high-level talks since the U.S. shot down a suspected Chinese surveillance balloon and Blinken postponed a much-anticipated trip to Beijing.

            A meeting between Blinken and Qin, who was formerly China’s ambassador to the U.S., would be their first in Qin’s current capacity.

            The broader G-20 meeting is expected to focus on food and energy security, especially for developing countries, which have been hit by fallout from the Ukraine conflict. In Bali, a number of nations that have not outright condemned Russia for the war expressed deep concern about its impact on the prices and supply of food and fuel.

            Before traveling to Delhi, Blinken will visit the Kazakh capital of Astana for talks with leaders there as well as a meeting of the so-called C5+1 group, made up of the U.S. and the former Soviet republics of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.

            At that meeting, he will stress the U.S. “commitment to the independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of Central Asian countries,"" the State Department said in a statement that mirrors the wording it has been using to support Ukraine against Russia.

            Blinken will then go to Tashkent for talks with Uzbek officials.WASHINGTON (AP) — Fresh from a meeting with China’s top diplomat and a U.N.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820686,Beijing official in Hong Kong warns US envoy after speech,"HONG KONG (AP) — A Chinese diplomat accused the U.S. consul general in Hong Kong of interfering in its affairs after he said the city's freedoms were eroding and warned the American not to cross political “red lines.”Consul General Gregory May gave a video address last month in which he expressed concern over diminished freedoms in Hong Kong and said its reputation as a business center depended on adherence to international standards and the rule of law.The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Office in Hong Kong said its commissioner Liu Guangyuan met with May recently to express objections to his “inappropriate” words and deeds.“Liu also drew three red lines for US consul general and US consulate general in Hong Kong, which is not to endanger China’s national security, not to engage in political infiltration in Hong Kong, and not to slander or damage Hong Kong’s development prospect,” his office said in reply to inquiries from The Associated Press.Liu also urged May to abide by diplomatic ethics, the office added.The U.S. consulate in Hong Kong did not immediately respond to a request for comment.May, in his address to the U.S. Center for Strategic & International Studies, also cited a decision by China’s legislature that lets Hong Kong's executive branch decide whether foreign lawyers can be involved in national security cases in the city.The decision was made after the city's top court allowed pro-democracy publisher Jimmy Lai to hire a British lawyer to represent him as he fights collusion charges that could bring a life prison sentence if he is convicted.Liu's office accused May of slandering the rule of law and freedom in Hong Kong when he questioned the legal decision made in Beijing and other changes in Hong Kong's governance.The U.S. and other democracies have been critical of China’s crackdown on political freedoms in the former British colony, which was handed back to China in 1997 with a promise by Beijing to keep Western-style liberties under a “one country, two systems” framework.Hong Kong is among a raft of issues that have sent ties between Beijing and Washington to their lowest level in years, including technology and trade, human rights, threats against Taiwan, and China’s claims in the South China Sea.",2023/02/24,345,World

The military said it would continue to observe the object until it left Taiwan’s airspace.It also told civil aviation authorities to warn airplanes about its presence. There was no mention of the balloon's origin.Earlier this month, the Ministry of National Defense dismissed reports that a spy balloon had been seen flying over the Presidential Office Building in Taipei. The object had been located over the ocean 40 kilometers away, the military said.Later, a balloon believed to be used by China to monitor the weather crashed at a military base on the frontline island of Dongyin in Lienchiang County.",2023/02/24,2735,Politics
