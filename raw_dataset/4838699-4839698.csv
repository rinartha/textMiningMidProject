https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838703,Canadian intel agency confirms Chinese interference in Vancouver elections,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A report from the Canadian Security and Intelligence Service (CSIS) says that China’s United Front operatives actively interfered in Vancouver’s municipal election in 2022 under the direction of the consul-general, with the purpose of electing politicians that would advance the interests of Beijing.The CSIS report was made in January 2022, but only recently became available to Canadian media. The Globe and Mail viewed the document and broke the story on Thursday (March 16).

The CSIS report outlines how China’s former consul-general in Vancouver, Tong Xiaoling (佟曉玲), sought to use resources available to her, including operatives in the Chinese-Canadian community aligned with the United Front, to promote and “groom” local politicians that would serve the interests of the Chinese Communist Party.On March 6, Justin Trudeau announced that an independent special investigation would be called to examine Chinese interference in Canadian elections. The news from Vancouver has prompted calls for Ottawa to expand the scope of the nationwide probe, which will be conducted by David Johnston, a former governor-general of Canada, who was named special investigator.The January 2022 report by the CSIS is not the first time that the Canadian intelligence service reported subversive actions related to election interference by Tong. In 2021, Tong reportedly boasted about employing an election strategy that led to the defeat of two Conservative MPs that represented British Columbia.

The January 2022 report is said to confirm China’s efforts to influence the outcome of local municipal elections that were held in October 2022. In one race, incumbent mayor Kennedy Stewart lost to Ken Sim by a margin of around 37,000 votes.In the last year of his term, Kennedy was critical of China, and was in favor of strengthening ties with Taiwan. The United Front reportedly used its media assets in Canada to assert that he was a “cold war mayor” and trying to spread “conspiracy theories to divide the Chinese community.”The CSIS report alleges that Tong actively campaigned behind the scenes to influence the Chinese-Canadian community in British Columbia. That community accounts for about one-fifth of the voting electorate in metro Vancouver, per the Globe and Mail.In the same municipal election, Tong reportedly identified a candidate that she was hopeful would prove to be a long-term asset for Chinese interests in Canadian politics. The CSIS report said that “Tong saw great promise” in a politician running for city council.She sought to become acquainted with them to see if they would prove to be a “good sapling to cultivate.” The Chinese consul-general discussed plans for the individual, who she hoped might go on to serve in provincial or federal politics, and serve the long-term interests of China in Canadian politics.Although the CSIS report does not explicitly name the politician, the Globe and Mail report infers that it was Lenny Zhou, who won election to the Vancouver City Council in the 2022 municipal elections.",2023/3/17,1200,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838708,"Former Australian PM Paul Keating labels Taiwan 'a territory,' 'so-called democracy'","TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — During a tirade over news of an AUKUS deal to build nuclear submarines for Australia, former Australian PM Paul Keating on Wednesday (March 15) belittled Taiwan as a ""so-called democracy"" that is a mere ""territory. ""On Monday, the three members of AUKUS, Australia, U.K., and U.S., unveiled a US$368 billion (NT$11.27 trillion) nuclear submarine program that will include at least three American-made nuclear submarines and the option to purchase two additional submarines. The submarine program aims to ""lift all three nations' submarine industrial bases and undersea capabilities, enhancing deterrence and promoting stability in the Indo-Pacific.""In response to the news, Keating issued a statement via The National Press Club in which he claimed the move was the worst international decision by Australia's Labor government since former Labor leader, Billy Hughes, ""sought to introduce conscription to augment Australian forces in World War One."" Keating claimed that the ""ball game has begun"" over the future of Taiwan, and alleged that the real aim of AUKUS is to serve Washington's ""underlying imperialism.""Keating, whose tenure as prime minister ended in 1996, described Taiwan as a ""territory that became a so-called 'democracy' as late as 1996."" In previous statements to the press club in 2021, Keating said that Taiwan is ""not a vital Australian interest,"" and he said that remains to be the case.He argued that an invasion of Tasmania would be a matter of vital interest to Australia. The ex-prime minister asserted that because Taiwan is a ""territory we have never recognized as a State,"" it is not worthy of such interest.Keating then dared current Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to ""explicitly suggest or leave open the question that Australia might go to war over Taiwan – at the urgings of the United States or anyone else.""On Friday (March 17), political scientist Wen-Ti Sung tweeted a screenshot of Keating's statements about Taiwan and stressed that although no democracy is perfect, the country is a ""solid multi-party liberal democracy that has undergone three peaceful transfers."" Sung noted that the 2022 Human Freedom Index (HFI), an index compiled by two think tanks, the U.S.-based Cato Institute, and Canada's Fraser Institute, rated Taiwan as the freest country in Asia .Sung also observed that The Economist Intelligence Business Unit (EIU) recently ranked Taiwan as the top ""fully democratic"" country in Asia and No. 8 in the world. This week, the human rights organization Civicus listed Taiwan as the only country in Asia with an open civic space for the fourth year in a row.The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) continues to claim that Taiwan is part of China and constantly coerces world governments and international organizations to toe this line. However, Taiwan has never been part of the People's Republic of China. The country has its own military, currency, constitution, legal system, passport, flag, diplomatic allies, and democratically elected government.Wikipedia editors in May 2020 fiercely debated the merits of referring to Taiwan as a ""state"" or a ""country,"" and after a month of heated back and forth, a vote was cast. In a summary of the exchange posted on June 4, a numeric majority was reached with 33 editors voting in favor of ""country,"" 10 opting for ""state,"" and five others choosing a variant of ""state.""Former Australian PM Paul Keating wrote: ""Taiwan, a territory which became a so-called 'democracy' as late as 1996"" 

While no democracy is without imperfections, Taiwan is a solid multi-party liberal democracy that has undergone 3 peaceful transfers of power since 2000. /1 pic.twitter.com/3XmHWgWKp5",2023/3/17,2137,Politics
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838709,Taiwan needs FinTech and trade-based money laundering solutions,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwan's banks have overseas entities in Asia Pacific, Europe, the United States, and Africa with some 632 overseas branches, subsidiaries, and representative offices, according to data from Taiwan’s Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC). 
These overseas branches, subsidiaries and representative offices come from a core of the 38 Taiwanese major banks. 
These branches, subsidiaries and representative offices are not created to service the offshore Taiwanese retail market. They exist to service export/import trade finance related activities that exist between Taiwan and its trading partners.
Where there is trade finance, there is lucrative criminal trade-based money laundering (TBML) activity. At the same time, banks have sophisticated monitoring and tracking systems for AML and sanctions-related activities that help track, trace, and report suspicious or financial crime-related transactions.










Though TBML related monitoring and tracking systems have improved in recent years and can leverage off some of the traditional monitoring systems, it is still burdened with huge amounts of hard copy-based documents, from simple invoices, shipping contracts, letters of credit and other related documentation for just one trade. This is the burden of TBML, and it is this burden that makes it an ideal breeding ground for financial crimes.  
Despite the existence of highly automated solutions to TBML, it does seem the current solution adopted by Taiwan banks is simply hiring more people to tackle the documentation burden. They remain reliant on highly trained, dedicated staff who know how to work through each transaction to catch the criminals.
It is common practice when working on TBML issues to adopt a four-eyes system and this keeps banks reliant on operational professionals who evaluate the transaction and present their findings to a manager, a compliance professional or even the Money Laundering Reporting Officer for approval, rejection, or the need for further investigation. It is tedious.
Nevertheless, combating TBML is vitally important if Taiwan is to continue the fight against financial crime.
The industry and its current people-centric approach is facing some very real challenges:

Paper Documents: The sheer volume of documents that relate to a single transaction is overwhelming. For example, letters of credit, bills of lading, vessel tracking, dual-use goods.
Increasing regulation: Governments, regulators and law enforcement agencies are fully aware of TBML risks. We can expect to see more stringent regulations as well as increasing fines and sanctions for breaches resulting from TBML.
Operational Resourcing: There is an overreliance on large numbers of bank staff to review transactions and evidence is emerging that those diligent staff are starting to age and progressing toward retirement.
Fresh evidence shows new graduates who want a career in banking don’t want to be involved in the paper mill of TBML. It’s not cutting edge, it’s not exciting. Resources are finite and the competition is fierce.

What we need to see adopted in Taiwan is the adoption of advances in FinTech with automated solutions for TBML. These FinTech solutions aim and claim to solve the following TBML compliance issues by automating:

Sanctions screening: Making sure no “bad names,” individuals, entities or sanctioned countries are involved in a transaction.
Dual Use Goods screening: Identifying goods, software and technology that can be used for both civilian and military applications.
Fair Price Checks: Making sure that what is being traded is not over or under-valued.
Vessel Tracking.
Red Flags: Flagging unexpected customer behavior, large cash payments, unexplained payments from a third party, or use of multiple or foreign accounts.

These FinTech systems facilitate rapid document examination to meet global standards and even consistency checks within documents or from document to document.
FinTech solutions will not see banks able to eliminate staff entirely as they do not magically automate the TBML manual systems. These solutions rely on digitalization in the form of manual or automated uploads of PDFs or document images.
As with all systems these solutions rely on parameters set by the banks in the form of auto-classification of documents and the resulting auto-extraction of key data depending on the document type. 
These systems are available, and they work. They make claims of +90% accuracy with document classification, +85% accuracy with data extraction and reduced document processing time from three to five hours, to 15 to 20 minutes.
Those are impressive numbers, but the challenge is to tap into Taiwan’s “untapped” market for automated FinTech TBML systems. Taiwan is not an easy market, especially for foreign FinTech solution providers.
Hopefully, change is on the horizon. FinTech solutions are clearly supported by the Taiwan government, the FSC, and organizations such as the Taiwan financial services roundtable, and the Taiwan Academy of Banking and Finance.
The work of Taiwan’s FinTech Hub, FinTechSpace, a tech-based environment whose mandate is to stimulate and accelerate Taiwan’s FinTech innovation and ecosystem is vital to the success of FinTech in Taiwan.
The clock is ticking on the need to adopt FinTech within TBML solutions and Taiwan’s banks must either develop their own bespoke proprietary system, work with FinTechSpace, or actively seek out foreign TBML FinTech solution providers and get ahead of the crowd.
Do not wait for the alarm bells to start ringing.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838789,Protests erupt in France over Macron’s retirement age push,"PARIS (AP) — Angry protesters disrupted traffic along a busy Paris ring road Friday in opposition to French President Manuel Macron's decision to ram a bill raising the retirement age from 62 to 64 through parliament without a vote while the government faces two no-confidence motions.A day after Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne invoked a special constitutional power to skirt a vote in a chaotic lower chamber, the far-right National Rally and a small group representing leftist lawmakers and others filed separate no-confidence motions that are expected to be voted on early next week.The fury Borne had faced in the National Assembly poured into the streets with citizens resolving to carry on their protests against the widely unpopular measure.Protesters halted cars along a stretch of the road circling Paris, students blocked some university campuses and Paris garbage collectors extended their strike for a 12th day, with piles of foul-smelling rubbish growing daily in the French capital. Striking sanitation workers continued their blockade Europe's largest incineration site and two other sites that treat Paris garbage.Leaders of the influential leftist CGT union have called on people to leave schools, factories, refineries and other work places to force the government to withdraw the pension reform bill, which is not yet a law.Macron took a calculated risk ordering Borne to make use of a special constitutional power that she had used 10 times before but without triggering the outpouring of anger caused by a bill that affects pensions and the retirement age.Thousands gathered in protest Thursday at the elegant Place de la Concorde, which faces the National Assembly building. As night fell, police officers charged the demonstrators in waves and used a water cannon to clear the Place. Small groups then moved through nearby streets near chic boutiques and high-end real estate, setting street fires along the way.Similar scenes repeated themselves in numerous other cities, from Rennes and Nantes in eastern France to Lyon and the southern port city of Marseille, where shop windows and bank fronts were smashed, according to French media.French Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin told radio station RTL on Friday that 310 people were arrested overnight. Most of the arrests, 258, were made in Paris, according to Darmanin.Several groups, including some yellow vest activists who had mounted formidable protests against Macron’s economic policies during his first term, called on the president’s opponents to march on the parliament at 18:00 (17:00GMT ) on Friday.The trade unions that had organized strikes and marches against a higher retirement age said more rallies and protest marches would take place in the days ahead, but stressed that any action should be peaceful. “This retirement reform is brutal, unjust, unjustified for the world of workers,” they declared Thursday night.Overwhelming streets with discontent and refusing to continue working is “the only way that we will get them to back down,” CGT union representative Régis Vieceli told The Associated Press on Friday. He added: “We are not going to stop.”Macron has made the proposed pension changes the key priority of his second term, arguing that reform is needed to make the French economy more competitive and to keep the pension system from diving into deficit. France, like many richer nations, faces lower birth rates and longer life expectancy.The Senate, controlled by conservatives favorable to the bill, passed it Thursday morning. However, frantic counts of lower-house lawmakers showed a slight risk that the pension reform wouldn't pass, leading to the decision to invoke Article 49-3 of the French Constitution to bypass a vote.If the expected no-confidence motion fails, the pension bill would be considered adopted. If it passes, it would spell the end Macron’s retirement reform plan and force the government to resign.Macron could reappoint Borne if he chooses, and a new Cabinet would be named.Getting a no-confidence motion to pass is challenging as it requires a majority of 287 lawmakers. The last time a no-confidence vote succeeded was in 1962.Macron’s centrist alliance has the most seats in the National Assembly. Leaders of the The Republicans have said their conservative party would not back the motion.While some party lawmakers might stray from that position, they are expected to be a minority.———-Surk reported from Nice, France.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838790,Trump vs. DeSantis: Rivals' very different styles on display,"DAVENPORT, Iowa (AP) — In his first trip to Iowa this year, Ron DeSantis did not take any questions from voters. He largely ignored the local press. He avoided the diners, pizza parlors and ice cream shops that have helped presidential contenders in the leadoff voting state showcase their personal appeal and charisma for decades.For DeSantis, a leading Republican presidential prospect, it was simply business as usual.The hard-charging Florida governor has emerged as a potent force in national politics while eschewing the personal connections, intimate moments and unscripted questions that have long fueled successful White House bids in the states that sit atop the presidential primary calendar. And as DeSantis begins to introduce himself to primary voters in the weeks leading up to his expected announcement, he is showing little interest in changing his ways.Allies insist he doesn't need to adjust anything, pointing to his dominant 19-point reelection victory last fall. But already, his Republican rivals — led by former President Donald Trump — are working to highlight the governor's go-it-alone approach and impersonal style by leaning into their own personal interactions on the campaign trail.The risks for DeSantis are becoming increasingly obvious in smaller rural states like Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, which will host three of the first four presidential primary contests in 2024.“No one’s gotten to know him the way they need to get to know him. I don’t know if they ever will,” New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, himself a potential candidate, said of DeSantis during a recent interview. ""Do you think Ron DeSantis has ever sat down for a cup of coffee with a reporter? No. It’s like physically not in him. He can’t do it. He doesn’t have that social connection with folks.”Perhaps no one is paying closer attention than Trump, who views DeSantis as his only real rival for the Republican presidential nomination.While DeSantis has taken a cloistered approach, Trump has been maximizing his interactions with voters and the press as he begins to visit early voting states — an effort that aides say is part of a larger push to contrast Trump's strengths with DeSantis' perceived weaknesses.During his first real day of campaigning in late January, Trump stopped by a beloved fried chicken and burger joint in West Columbia, South Carolina. He posed for photos with patrons and ordered a chocolate-dipped ice cream.One of the workers behind the counter offered Trump an impromptu prayer, and the moment went viral. After seeing the extraordinary response, the campaign leaned in.It quickly planned a visit to East Palestine, Ohio, to meet with residents and local officials affected by a toxic train derailment. Before leaving, Trump stopped at a local McDonald’s, where he signed autographs, passed out red “Make America Great Again” caps and ordered food for his staff and first responders.“I know this menu better than you do,” he told the smiling cashier.In Iowa on Monday, Trump directed his motorcade to make a quick stop at the Machine Shed Restaurant, a longtime fixture in the eastern city of Davenport.“So, how’s the food here?” he boomed as he strolled in, shocking patrons and leaving the staff giggling in delight.Trump shook hands, slapped backs and posed for pictures with anyone who wanted one.While such scenes were hardly common during Trump's first two campaigns, the former president is taking a new approach as he wages his third presidential bid. The professional host and career glad-hander relishes personal interactions with supporters, and even longtime critics acknowledge his charisma in one-on-one interactions.Such stops give voters “a way to see the president in a different light,"" said Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung.“Usually they see him on camera or at a rally or in an interview. They don’t necessarily get to see him up close,” he said. ""And this is one way to bridge that gap. And it’s also one way to make this campaign more distinct.”Indeed, Trump's personal approach stands as a clear contrast to DeSantis, who is known for being much more guarded — especially when the media is present.After two presidential campaigns and four years in the White House, Trump is extremely well practiced at taking tough questions from the national press. And his team has been working to make him more accessible to reporters.He has been inviting small groups to travel aboard his campaign plane. During trips to South Carolina and Iowa, he took questions from local press.Trump did the same with voters after delivering a long speech Monday in Iowa, answering several questions from a lucky few of the thousands who packed into a downtown Davenport theater. Aides noted that Trump's crowd eclipsed DeSantis', and Trump acknowledged, tongue in cheek, that it was “dangerous” to invite unscripted questions after a well-received speech.He did it anyway for 20 minutes.DeSantis’ allies strongly disagree with the growing perception that he is insulated and not sufficiently committed to building personal relationships with voters and stakeholders in key states.They note that he is not a presidential candidate. Should he decide to enter the contest — which he is widely expected to do after his state legislature adjourns in May — he will likely adopt a campaign strategy similar to the one that took him to all of Florida’s 67 counties before his November reelection. Over that time, they point out, he regularly made unscripted appearances at restaurants, bars and high school sporting events.When DeSantis met with New York City law enforcement officials last month, for example, he stopped by a Staten Island bagel shop.One major difference between DeSantis and Trump is that Trump has welcomed press coverage of his unscripted moments.While Trump often bashes the media at his raucous rallies, he is also an avid consumer of the news and craves the attention. DeSantis, by contrast, employs a consistent disdain for the mainstream press in public and in private.It's much the same with fellow Republican governors and business leaders. DeSantis sees little need in developing relationships with Republican peers in other states, major corporations or the mainstream media — aside from a few allies in the conservative press.The Florida governor's relationship with the media is strained to say the least.He regularly schedules press conferences but often holds them outside major media markets with only a few hours' notice, making it virtually impossible for the journalists who best know him and his policies to get there in time to ask tough questions. Usually, he packs such events with supporters.On Thursday, for example, he hosted a news conference at a restaurant an hour away from Tampa.He got only a handful of questions, all of which appeared designed for him to highlight his own positions. One journalist asked him about the need for babies to get the “jab,” a derisive term conservatives use to describe the COVID-19 vaccine.Scott Jennings, a Republican political analyst, said DeSantis' contempt for the media is central to the Florida governor’s brand. And his cautious approach could help project a more professional operation in contrast to Trump’s freewheeling style.Still, Jennings said, DeSantis' approach is “inherently risky.”“Nobody’s ever really done it before,” he said. “But my instinct is Republicans are going to love it.”Hogan Gidley, a former Trump aide and veteran of presidential politics, said it’s critical for presidential candidates to hone their policies and performances with unscripted moments in key states like Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina before an official announcement.“A large part of that includes making personal connections with activists, with grassroots leaders, with elected officials — all the ones who will be responsible for the blocking and tackling needed to win a primary in those states,” Gidley said. “Anyone who ignores that does so at their own political peril.”___ Associated Press writer Anthony Izaguirre contributed to this report from Tallahassee, Florida.",2023/3/18,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838792,"Slovakia, after Poland, agrees to give Ukraine Soviet jets","PRAGUE (AP) — Slovakia’s government on Friday approved a plan to give Ukraine its fleet of 13 Soviet-era MiG-29 fighter jets, becoming the second NATO member country to heed the Ukrainian government's pleas for warplanes to help defend against Russia's invasion.Prime Minister Eduard Heger said during a news conference announcing the decision that his government was “on the right side of history.” Earlier, Heger tweeted that military aid was key to ensuring Ukraine can defend itself and all of Europe against Russia.Poland announced Thursday that it would give Ukraine around a dozen MiG-29s, starting with four expected to be delivered in the coming days. Both Poland and Slovakia had indicated previously they were ready to grant Ukraine's requests for military aircraft, but only as part of a wider international coalition.Heger said his government's move “is closely coordinated with the Polish side, Ukraine and other allies.”Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the promised planes were another example of NATO members ""raising the level of their direct involvement in the conflict.”“The equipment deliveries naturally won’t have any impact on the outcome of the special military operation, but it may bring more misfortune to Ukraine and Ukrainian people,” Peskov said during a conference call with reporters.Slovakia will receive 200 million euros ($213 million) from the European Union as compensation and unspecified arms from the United States worth 700 million euros ($745 million) in exchange for giving its MiG-29 fleet to Ukraine, Defense Minister Jaroslav Nad said.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has repeatedly asked Western countries for fighter jets, but NATO allies held off, citing concern about escalating the alliance’s role in the war.In response to Poland’s announcement on Thursday, the White House said Warsaw's move would have no bearing on President Joe Biden, who has resisted calls to provide U.S. F-16s to Ukraine, and that it was up to other nations to explain their own positions.Michał Baranowski, managing director of Warsaw-based GMF East, part of the German Marshall Fund think tank, said changing conditions now permit such a move since the initial reluctance to respond to Ukraine's request.“Many red lines have been crossed since that discussion last year,” Baranowski told The Associated Press by phone. Sending MiGs now “is not the same difficult political sale that it was last year.”Ukraine will be able to use the MiGs immediately without needing any training.Zelenskyy appealed directly to Heger for aircraft at an EU summit in Brussels last month.Slovakia grounded its MiGs in the summer due to a lack of spare parts and expertise to help maintain them after Russian technicians returned home. In the absence of its own aircraft, fellow NATO members Poland and the Czech Republic stepped in to monitor Slovak air space.Before Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022, Ukraine had several dozen MiG-29s it inherited in the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, but it’s unclear how many remain in service after more than a year of fighting.The Slovak government that made the decision to sign a bilateral deal with Ukraine for the jets has only limited powers after a December no-confidence vote brought down the coalition government that was formed after the country's 2020 election.The next election is set for September, when the opposition stands a good chance of winning. Its leaders include populist former Prime Minister Robert Fico, who opposes military support for Ukraine and EU sanctions on Russia and has said Slovakia’s government has no mandate to deliver fighter jets to Ukraine.Opposition parties including Fico's Smer-Social Democracy party rejected the government's decision Friday, threatening to sue.Slovakia signed a deal to buy 14 U.S. F-16 Block 70/72 fighter jets, but delivery was pushed back two years to early 2024.___Vanessa Gera in Warsaw, Poland contributed.___Follow AP's coverage of the war in Ukraine: https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine-war",2023/3/17,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838794,Supreme Court honors legacy of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, whose death ahead of the 2020 election led to a conservative shift on the Supreme Court, was remembered Friday during ceremonies at the high court as a legendary champion for women's rights.Speaking just two days after what would have been the justice's 90th birthday, Chief Justice John Roberts called her a “woman of conviction, courage and quiet compassion.”“Small in stature, she stands as a giant in the history of this court,” Roberts said during a ceremonial session of the court attended by its nine current members as well as former justices Anthony Kennedy and Stephen Breyer.Ginsburg’s death just over six weeks before the 2020 election was immensely consequential. It allowed then-President Donald Trump to fill the liberal justice’s seat on the court with a conservative, Justice Amy Coney Barrett, and gave conservatives a 6-3 majority on the bench. Barrett was among the justices who voted last year to overturn Roe v. Wade and do away with constitutional protections for abortion, protections Ginsburg had backed as a justice.Ginsburg served as a justice for 27 years and was the Supreme Court's second female member, but as an advocate for women's rights she had “already used the law to change our country profoundly for the better as an advocate prior to becoming a member of this court,” the chief justice said.Speaking during ceremonies in the courtroom, Attorney General Merrick Garland called Ginsburg the “chief tactician in the campaign for equal rights for women.” He noted that beginning in 1971 she filed more than 20 Supreme Court briefs related to women's rights. She argued six cases before the court, winning five. It was a time when there were few women lawyers, and even fewer women arguing before the highest court.Garland remembered being at the Supreme Court as a law clerk, a young lawyer who works for a justice for a year, when Ginsburg argued. The clerks had been told by their justices that she was “the best advocate we would hear” all year, he said, and “she did not disappoint.""“Justice Ginsburg was brilliant, courageous and principled. She believed deeply in the capacity of the law to fulfill our country’s fundamental promise of equality,” Garland said.Ginsburg was also remembered Friday by some of the men and women who were her law clerks. That included Biden administration Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, the administration's top Supreme Court lawyer, as well as several judges and professors.“She was a visionary as an advocate who championed equal citizenship for all persons and as a judge who fought every day to fulfill this nation’s promise,” Prelogar said.Other law clerks remembered her passion for operas, which she would take them to, and how she would edit their work, using copies printed out with triple spaces between the lines and hand editing in red pencil, sometimes cutting out lines and taping them elsewhere if she wanted to move things around. She had a commitment to, in her words, “get it right and keep it tight,"" Garland said.The ceremonies at the high court, technically a meeting of the Supreme Court Bar followed by a special session of the court, are a tradition at the high court following the death of a justice, a tradition dating back to 1822.Ginsburg was appointed to the Supreme Court by President Bill Clinton in 1993. Her appointment followed by more than a decade that of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, the court's first female justice. Ginsburg said at her confirmation hearing that “In my lifetime, I expect to see three, four, perhaps even more women on the high court bench.” Ginsburg ultimately served with two other women: Justice Sonia Sotomayor and Justice Elena Kagan. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson joined the court last year, giving the court four women for the first time.Speakers remembered in particular the 1996 majority opinion Ginsburg wrote in which the court ruled that the then male-only Virginia Military Institute must be opened to women. They also remembered her 2013 dissent in a case in which the court cut out a key part of the federal law ensuring the voting rights of Black people, Hispanics and other minorities, saying it was “like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet.”Late in life as the court's senior liberal Ginsburg became something of an icon, particularly to young women, and earned the nickname the “Notorious RBG.” Among the things she was known for was her collection of judicial collars, lace and beaded adornments she would wear over her robe. She was also an avid proponent of exercise and regularly worked out with a personal trainer, who wrote a book about her workout routine that came out in 2017.Over the years, Ginsburg had several public battles with cancer. She died at age 87 of complications from metastatic pancreatic cancer. After her death, she made history as the first woman to lie in state at the U.S. Capitol.Ginsburg is buried at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia, just over the Potomac River from Washington.",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838795,"NBA feud or rivalry? Warriors, Memphis drama is must-see TV","Stephen Curry offers a simple answer for all the back and forth between his four-time NBA champion Golden State Warriors and the upstart Memphis Grizzlies over the past two seasons.For Curry, it’s not a feud or a bitter rivalry. The Warriors don't have the same history with the Grizzlies that they do with say, the Cavaliers. Or with LeBron James in whatever uniform he’s wearing.“Just a team that is tough to beat,” Curry said about the Grizzlies. “They're really talented. ... Also a team that you're going to need to play well to beat, but the history isn't there yet.”Grizzlies forward Jaren Jackson Jr. disagrees.“Every time we touch the floor, it’s a rivalry,” Jackson said. “We saw this team many times. We feel like every single time we’re out there with them, it’s a rivalry for sure.”There always seems to be some drama, a little something extra when the teams meet: hard fouls, trash-talking or some other theatrics.Warriors guard Jordan Poole said earlier this week: “I guess some days you can call it a rivalry.""Whatever it is, the Warriors and the young, brash Grizzlies are usually must-see TV.The bad blood between the two really began to percolate during last season's playoffs when Gary Payton II suffered a broken left elbow in Game 2 after a flagrant foul that that got Memphis’ Dillon Brooks suspended for Game 3.Warriors coach Steve Kerr said Brooks crossed the line and “broke the code” of NBA conduct.Ja Morant fired back after limping off in the fourth quarter of Game 3. Warriors guard Jordan Poole grabbed his knee while trying to strip the ball and Morant later posted, and then deleted, video of the play with the words “broke the code.”And the ill will has carried over into their first three games this season:— Klay Thompson drew a technical in that Christmas night win for standing over and taunting Dillon Brooks as he was down on the court. Thompson called it “some good old-fashioned trash talk.” Poole was ejected, and even Kerr drew one of Golden State’s six technicals in the game.— Curry was ejected from Golden State’s 122-120 win on Jan. 25 after tossing his mouthpiece in frustration, seemingly more with this teammates than with the Grizzlies.— Brooks and Green got up close and personal after a steal and bucket in Memphis’ 131-110 wire-to-wire win a week ago, standing face-to-face with the 2017 NBA Defensive Player of the Year. Green said after the game Brooks was trying to bait him into a technical foul but that he only draws a tech when he wants.“One of us (is) baitable and one of us” isn’t, said Green, who had said on his podcast before that game that the Grizzlies’ dynasty would start only after they get rid of Brooks.Brooks responded after the Grizzlies’ win: “The fact that he was trying to pin my teammates against me. That was a low blow. But that’s the type of player he is.”So, no the history isn't there and the Warriors downplay the matchup — it's clear the Grizzlies have Golden State's attention.There should be playoff atmosphere Saturday in the teams' final regular-season matchup, which has postseason implications.Morant will still be sidelined as part of his now eight-game suspension by the NBA for displaying a gun while at a Colorado strip club in the early hours of March 4. Though Memphis routed Golden State last week without Morant.Golden State needs every road win it can steal down the stretch. The Warriors are 7-27 away from home this season. Curry, who is having another MVP-caliber season, understands the urgency and had 50 points Wednesday night in a road loss against the Los Angeles Clippers.The Grizzlies would like to extend the Warriors' road woes, not that they need any extra incentives when playing Golden State.“We have all the motivation that we need playing this team just as is, just the history that we got with them,” Grizzlies guard Tyus Jones said. “It’s always a battle. It’s always an intense matchup.”Green made clear the standard that he uses to gauge whether or not the Warriors and Grizzlies becme a true rivalry: winning titles, not a game here or there.“Clearly we won four times, and I think their organization has zero championships, so I can’t consider that a rivalry,” Green said.Maybe not, but their matchups have been very entertaining.___AP Sports Writer Janie McCauley and Associated Press freelancer Clay Bailey contributed to this report.___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/17,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838797,"Arizona, Virginia add to reputations for March sadness","Arizona and Virginia rightfully lay claim to proud college basketball traditions, whether you're talking about the Wildcats winning the national championship in 1997, the Cavaliers doing it 22 years later or the many stars the programs have sent to the NBA and overseas.They also have developing reputations for NCAA Tournament disappointments.The stunning loss by second-seeded Arizona to No. 15 seed Princeton on Thursday, and fourth-seeded Virginia's collapse in the closing seconds against Furman, were merely the latest examples of their humiliating March heartbreaks.The Wildcats have been bounced by teams seeded worse than them in five consecutive NCAA tourney trips, while the Cavaliers were bumped by a No. 13 seed for the second straight year and five years to the day since becoming the only No. 1 seed to lose to a 16-seed.“It doesn’t take away from what these guys have done and what we’ve experienced over the years, but you wanted it when you felt like you had it, and that was a tough one,” Cavs coach Tony Bennett acknowledged after the 68-67 loss to the Paladins, who essentially won by cashing in a turnover with a deep 3-pointer with 2.2 seconds left on the clock.Bennett knows as well as anyone that agonizing notoriety is easy to earn and brutally difficult to overcome.Doesn't matter that the names and faces change from year to year.The Cavaliers were Final Four favorites when they arrived in Charlotte, North Carolina, for their first-round game against UMBC in 2018. Forty painful minutes later, they were saddled with a lopsided 74-54 loss and the ignominity of becoming the first men's team — after 135 wins by a No. 1 seed — to lose to one of the four lowest-seeded teams in the tournament.Most hoops fans remember the upset vividly, perhaps more than the national title the Cavs won a year later.“I would just say everybody at this level is good,” Virginia guard Isaac McKneely offered by way of explanation. “I know there’s the seeding and all that, but everybody can beat everybody, as obviously you’ve seen.”If misery loves company, the Wildcats can relate.Since losing in the regional final to Wisconsin in 2015, Arizona has been knocked out of the opening round three times despite being seeded sixth or better each time — the first two with Sean Miller on the sideline and the most recent, a 59-55 defeat on Thursday in which No. 15 seed Princeton scored the final nine points, with Tommy Lloyd running the show.The run of disappointments began with a loss to No. 11 seed Wichita State in 2016. It continued against No. 11 seed Xavier in a regional semifinal the next year. The fourth-seeded Wildcats lost to No. 13 seed Buffalo in 2018 and, as a trendy title pick as a No. 1 seed last year, fell to fifth-seeded Houston in another regional semifinal.Just how easy can the stink of an upset loss settle on even the bluest of bluebloods? Just ask Kansas.Two years after playing for the 2003 national championship, the Jayhawks were dumped by No. 14 seed Bucknell and No. 13 seed Bradley in consecutive years. Their still-new coach, Bill Self, came to rue the “Killer B's,” and not even a run to the Elite Eight could shake the questions about whether he could get it done in Lawrence.He could, of course. The Jayhawks won the 2008 title and are the defending national champions.Winning a national title is about the only thing missing from the resume of Gonzaga coach Mark Few, but it might take one for the Bulldogs to shake an uneasy March reputation for underachievement. They have been a No. 1 seed on five occassions, and twice reached the title game, but have become known as much for their losses as their wins.“We’ve been in enough of those 1-16 games and you’re like, ‘Holy smokes,’” said Few, whose team plays Grand Canyon on Friday night. “Last year, I walked out for the tip and Georgia State, I think they were bigger than us at dang-near every position. And I’m like, ‘This is a 16-seed?’ I think that’s kind of where we are right now.”Plenty of schools have positive reputations come March.Princeton has been known as a giant killer ever since its backdoor-cutting, first-round upset of UCLA under Pete Carril in 1996, when current coach Mitch Henderson was playing for the Tigers. And while they beat UNLV as a No. 5 seed two years later, the Tigers had failed to reach the second round for another 25 years — until Thursday's win over Arizona.“There’s going to be some comparisons from some of you, I’m sure, to Coach Carril. I want to be really clear that this group did this,” Henderson said. “That was a really long time ago. This group did something special for its university, for the fans, for the former players and for one another. Very similar way that you see in the tournament, they just came together and did it.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/17,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838800,"On the rise, Big Ten eyes women's NCAA tourney breakthrough","Iowa superstar Caitlin Clark has looked over the women's NCAA Tournament bracket, eyed the potential matchups facing her second-seeded Hawkeyes and the rest of their Big Ten brethern, and come to a rather optimistic conclusion.“The Big Ten can certainly place two in the Final Four,” she said. “I don’t think that’s a stretch by any means.”Just one would end a long dry spell.In an almost impossible amalgamation of bad luck, poor draws and underachieving basketball, the Power 5 conference — with its big budgets and high-profile programs — has only advanced a women's team to the national semifinals once since 2005, and that was league newcomer Maryland in 2015. And it's been since 1999, when Katie Douglas and Stephanie White-McCarty led Purdue to a national title win over Duke, that the league crowned its only NCAA champion.“Understand, we've played some of the best teams in America all year long. The Big Ten is loaded — Maryland, Ohio State, Indiana, all of us top-three seeds” said Clark, a two-time first-team All-American and the nation's third-leading scorer. “It has shown how our conference has really grown on the national stage. We need to use that as a confidence-builder.”That might be the only thing lacking from the Big Ten right now: confidence.The league certainly has star power.Clark was joined on the All-America first team by Mackenzie Holmes, who led Indiana to the Big Ten regular-season title and the No. 1 seed in its region. Diamond Miller of Maryland, the No. 2 seed in its region, was voted second-team All-American. Four others in the tournament — Indiana’s Grace Berger, Michigan standout Leigha Brown, Makira Cook of Illinois and Iowa’s Monika Czinano — earned honorable mention honors this week.It also has better depth. Better coaching. And better support. Indiana and Purdue sold out both their games this season, the first time the Hoosiers have done it at Assembly Hall, and their game against Iowa in Iowa City was an early sellout, too.“This time of year, after you've been beating each other up all season long, you are all Big Ten,” Maryland coach Brenda Freese said, ""and you want each and every team to move through the bracket as far as possible.“The conference really prepared us for now, to see so many teams are hosting,” added Frese, who led the Terrapins to the national title in 2006, when they were still part of the ACC. “But now, just understand that each and every team has to, you know, continue to use what we did during the conference slate and take this into this tournament.”The testing began before the Big Ten schedule for most of its teams.The Terps were blown out by No. 1 South Carolina in November but also beat top-10 teams UConn and Notre Dame. The Hoosiers earned ranked wins over Tennessee and North Carolina. Iowa lost a competitive game to the Huskies and beat Iowa State. Ohio State also beat the Vols along with Louisville during the nonconference portion of its schedule.The Big Ten beat ‘em in November and December. There's no reason to believe it can’t beat 'em in March.“The Big Ten is kind of a different conference when it comes to physicality, strength, athleticism,"" said Brown, whose No. 6 seed Wolverines played UNLV on Friday. “So I think just really being able to use that to our advantage, yeah, and it's just a matter of really coming out of the gates just really ready to go and really taking it to them.”The Hoosiers, of course, should have the easiest road to the Final Four. They open the tournament Saturday and should be heavily favored all the way to the Elite Eight, where they could run into No. 2 seed Utah or No. 3 seed LSU.Iowa opened Friday against Southeastern Louisiana with a favorable path to a regional final against Stanford, and fellow No. 2 seed Maryland is aiming for a shot against the top-ranked Gamecocks for a spot in the Final Four.The third-seeded Buckeyes have the toughest road to Dallas in a region with No. seed Virginia Tech and No. 2 seed UConn.“I think now we have teams, A, good enough to be there and B, maybe a path to get there,” Hawkeyes coach Lisa Bluder said. “Sometimes the path is not as easy. Sometimes you get a good seed, but it comes down to matchups a lot of times over seed, and I feel like this year, maybe some of us have a good path to get there as well.“I’m excited about this opportunity,” added Bluder, who got the Hawkeyes to the Elite Eight in 2019. “I think that the Big Ten has proved over and over this year how good this conference is. You know, I think this could definitely be the year.”___AP Sports Writers Noah Trister in College Park, Maryland; Mike Marot in Bloomington, Indiana; Brett Martel in Baton Rouge, Louisiana; and Associated Press writer John Bohnencamp in Iowa City, Iowa, contributed to this report. ___https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/17,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838846,State and US officials tout spending to plug 'orphan wells',"ATCHAFALAYA NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE, La. (AP) — Stacks of valves, networks of pipes and hulking, two-story-tall tanks litter parts of the swampy landscape of Louisiana’s Atchafalaya Basin, rusting relics of sites where oil wells were drilled in the 1970s, an unwanted legacy of the energy industry that has long helped drive the Louisiana economy.They are among an estimated 2 million unplugged U.S. “ orphan wells,” abandoned by the companies that drilled them. There are more than 4,500 such wells in Louisiana, according to the state Department of Natural Resources. The owners can’t be found, have gone out of business or otherwise can’t be made to pay in a state where there are decades-long political debates involving legislation and litigation over the environmental effects of oil and gas drilling.The Biden administration plans to tackle the problem nationally with $4.7 billion from the bipartisan infrastructure bill passed in late 2021. Administration officials joined their state counterparts in the Atchafalaya National Wildlife Refuge recently to tout the efforts.“The state and federal government, we are left to clean them up because of the hazard they present,” Martha Williams, director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said. She was visiting what is known as the B-5 well site with Thomas Harris, secretary of the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources., and Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries Secretary Jack Montoucet.The abandoned wells can leak oilfield brine and cancer-causing chemicals that are components of crude oil, such as benzene. They also can emit methane, a greenhouse gas that’s 80 times as potent as carbon dioxide.In the south Louisiana wetlands, where salty water can exacerbate the deterioration, defunct wells threaten the environmental health of an area that is home to an abundance of wildlife: numerous species of migratory fowl; deer, beaver, bears and a variety of other mammals; the once-endangered alligator among many other reptiles. Coastal wetlands also act as nurseries for Gulf of Mexico crabs, shrimp and other fish species.Williams’ agency last year announced it had received more than $13 million of infrastructure bill money to remediate 175 orphaned wells on six national wildlife refuges in Oklahoma and Louisiana.Montoucet said the infusion of money to help plug the wells is welcome, but he also pointed to the need for greater oversight by the state.“With this new injection of money and addressing the issue that we have, I think we’re on the right path,” Montoucet said. “And from now on, when people come for applications to drill, certainly we’re going to have more regulations in place to ensure that these sites are not left like this.”___McGill reported from New Orleans.",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838847,Turkish FM to visit Egypt as countries end decade-long split,"ISTANBUL (AP) — Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu will visit Egypt, both countries announced Friday, the first such high-level trip in more than a decade as their leaders repair relations damaged in the wake of the 2011 Arab Spring.A statement from the Turkish Foreign Ministry said Cavusoglu will go to Egypt on Saturday, at the invitation of his Egyptian counterpart, Sameh Shoukry. Egypt’s foreign ministry said the visit will be a step in “restoring normal relations between the two countries.”The ministers will discuss bilateral relations as well as regional and international issues.Cavusoglu’s trip follows Shoukry’s visit to Turkey’s earthquake-hit region last month.Diplomatic relations between Ankara and Cairo have been frosty for almost a decade. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was a close ally of Egypt’s previous Islamist president, Mohammed Morsi, who was ousted by the military amid widespread protests in 2013.Turkey in recent years abandoned its critical approach to Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi’s government, as it tried to repair the frayed ties. In November, Erdogan and el-Sissi were photographed shaking hands during the World Cup in Qatar.The last Turkish foreign minister to visit Egypt was Ahmet Davutoglu, who in 2012 attended a Syrian opposition conference held by the Arab League in Cairo.",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838848,Will Americans end up footing the bill for bank failures?,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The government's response to the failure of two large banks has already involved hundreds of billions of dollars. So will ordinary Americans end up paying for it, one way or another? And what will the price tag be?It could be months before the answers are fully known. The Biden administration said it will guarantee uninsured deposits at both banks. The Federal Reserve announced a new lending program for all banks that need to borrow money to pay for withdrawals.On Thursday, the Fed provided the first glimpse of the scale of the response: It said banks had borrowed about $300 billion in emergency funding in the past week, with nearly half that amount going to holding companies for the two failed banks to pay depositors. The Fed did not say how many other banks borrowed money and added that it expects the loans to be repaid.The goal is to prevent a broadening panic in which customers rush to pull out so much money that even healthy banks buckle. That scenario would unsettle the entire financial system and risk derailing the economy.Taxpayers will probably bear no direct cost for the failure of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. But other banks may have to help defray the cost of covering uninsured deposits. Over time, those banks could pass higher costs on to customers, forcing everyone to pay more for services.Here are some questions and answers about the cost of the bank collapses:HOW IS THE RESPONSE BEING PAID FOR?Most of the cost of guaranteeing all deposits at both banks will likely be covered by the proceeds the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. receives from winding down the two banks — either by selling them to other financial institutions or by auctioning off their assets.Any costs beyond that would be paid for out of the FDIC's deposit insurance fund, which is typically used in the event of a bank failure to reimburse depositors for up to $250,000 per account. The fund is maintained with fees paid by participating banks.Both Silicon Valley and Signature banks had a strikingly high share of deposits above that amount: 94% of Silicon Valley’s deposits were uninsured, as were 90% of deposits at Signature. The average figure for large banks is about half that level.If necessary, the insurance fund will be replenished by a “special assessment” on banks, the FDIC, Fed and Treasury said in a joint statement. Though the cost of that assessment could ultimately be borne by bank customers, it's not clear how much money would be involved.Kathryn Judge, a law professor at Columbia University, said a bigger cost to consumers and the economy could stem from potentially major changes to the financial system that result from this episode.If all customer deposits were considered guaranteed by the government, formally or informally, then regulations would need to be strengthened to prevent bank failures or lessen their costs when they do happen. Banks might have to pay permanently higher fees to the FDIC.“It's going to require us to revisit the entire bank regulatory framework,"" Judge said. “That's far more significant than the modest costs that other banks will pay.”WILL TAXPAYERS BE ON THE HOOK?President Joe Biden has insisted that no taxpayer money will be used to resolve the crisis. The White House is desperate to avoid any perception that average Americans are “bailing out” the two banks in a way similar to the highly unpopular bailouts of the biggest financial firms during the 2008 financial crisis.“No losses associated with the resolution of Silicon Valley Bank will be borne by the taxpayer,” read the joint statement from the Treasury, Fed and FDIC.Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen defended that view Thursday under tough questioning from GOP lawmakers.The Fed's lending program to help banks pay depositors is backed by $25 billion of taxpayer funds that would cover any losses on the loans. But the Fed says it's unlikely that the money will be needed because the loans will be backed by Treasury bonds and other safe securities as collateral.Even if taxpayers aren't directly on the hook, some economists say the banks' customers still stand to benefit from government support.“Saying that the taxpayer won’t pay anything ignores the fact that providing insurance to somebody who didn’t pay for insurance is a gift,” said Anil Kashyap, an economics professor at the University of Chicago. “And that’s kind of what happened.”SO IS THIS A BAILOUT?Biden and other Democrats in Washington deny that their actions amount to a bailout of any kind.“It's not a bailout as happened in 2008,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, said this week while proposing legislation to toughen bank regulation. “It is, in effect, protection of depositors and a preventive measure to stop a run on other banks all around the country.""Biden has stressed that the banks' managers will be fired and their investors will not be protected. Both banks will cease to exist. In the 2008 crisis, some financial institutions that received government financial aid, like the insurer AIG, were rescued from near-certain bankruptcy.Yet many economists say the depositors at Silicon Valley Bank, which included wealthy venture capitalists and tech startups, are still receiving government help.“Why is it sensible capitalism for somebody to take a risk, and then be protected from that risk when that risk actually happens?” asked Raghuram Rajan, a finance professor at the University of Chicago and former head of India's central bank. “It’s probably good for the short term in the sense that you don’t have a widespread panic. ... But it is problematic for the system long term.""Many Republicans on Capitol Hill argue that smaller community banks and their customers will shoulder some of the cost.Banks in rural Oklahoma ""are about to pay a special fee to be able to bail out millionaires in San Francisco,” Sen. James Lankford, a Republican from Oklahoma, said on the Senate floor.___Associated Press writer Fatima Hussein and video journalist Rick Gentilo contributed to this report.",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838849,Elite officers in Israel's military plan Sunday walkout,"JERUSALEM (AP) — Hundreds of elite officers in Israel’s military reserves say they will not show up for duty starting on Sunday in protest over the government's plans to overhaul the judicial system.The firm date is the first time set for an unprecedented political protest within the security services. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's controversial legal overhaul has sparked weeks of mass protests across Israel amidst a deteriorating security situation in the occupied West Bank and rising tensions with Palestinians.In two separate letters published Thursday, about 750 elite officers from the Air Force, special forces, and Mossad threatened to stop volunteering for duty. The typically taboo talk underlines how deeply the overhaul plan has divided Israel and is now tearing at what Israeli Jews see as their most respected institution, the military.After completing three years of mandatory service, many Israelis continue in the reserves until their 40s, when service becomes voluntary. Reservists are the backbone of the force when security crises erupt, and regularly serve in complex operations overseas.One hundred elite Air Force officers, including two former chiefs, said in an open letter reported by Channel 12 News, Israel’s top television program, that Netanyahu's government was subverting the nation's security and democracy.“We fear that following military orders would be a violation of our oath, our conscience and our mission,"" read the Air Force reservists' letter.About 650 more officers from the reserves' special forces and cyber units said in a separate letter that, “We will not serve a dictatorship.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838923,Ukraine updates: Slovakia to send MIG-29 jets to Ukraine,"The Slovak government approved sending 13 MIG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine, Prime Minister Eduard Heger said on Friday, stepping up its military assistance to Kyiv in its fight against the Russian invasion.Slovakia is the second country to send war planes to Kyiv after Poland, which announced on Thursday it would do so.Its fleet of MiG-29 planes was retired last summer, and most of them are not in operational condition. It will send those that are operational, and the rest will go for spare parts.Slovakia will also supply part of its KUB air-defence system, Heger said.NATO allies in the former communist eastern europe such as Poland and Slovakia have been particularly vocal supporters of Kyiv since Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, 2022.On Thursday, Polish President Andrzej Duda announced that Poland will send four MIG-29 jets to Ukraine in the next few days.Both Poland and Slovakia had indicated they were ready to hand over their planes, but only as part of a wider international coalition doing the same. It remains unclear whether other countries would also share their military planes.The debate over whether to provide non-NATO member Ukraine with military fighter jets started last year, but NATO allies held off, citing concern about escalating the alliance's role in the war.Here are some of the other notable developments concerning the war on Friday, March 17:Russia's Defense Ministry said it had decorated pilots involved in an incident this week that led to an American drone to crash over the Black Sea.""Russia's Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu presented state awards to the Su-27 pilots who prevented an American MQ-9 drone from violating (Russia's) temporary airspace,"" the ministry said.Moscow has said that it established airspace restrictions over the Black Sea as part of its military intervention in Ukraine in accordance with international norms.Washington released footage Thursday of what it said showed Russian military jets bearing down on the drone but Moscow maintains the aircraft was downed after it lost control.However, Moscow reiterated that the pilots ""did not use on-board weapons, made no contact with the UAV and safely returned to their home airfield.""Washington said after the incident that it would ""continue to fly and to operate wherever international law allows.""Fabrice Pothier, a security analyst and CEO of Rasmussen Global, a political consultancy, told DW why Poland is taking the initiative as the first NATO member to promise fighter jets to Ukraine in this war.According to Pothier, it's an attempt by Warsaw to push the other allies to chip in with more fighter jets for Ukraine. He reminded that this issue is time sensitive, as it takes a very long time to train Ukrainian pilots to fly not only MiG-29, but potentially F-16 fighter jets.Pothier said that having more fighter jets will allow the Ukrainian forces to contest more the air domain from the Russian air force and to target air targets, especially cruise missiles, which the Russians keep on using against critical infrastructure and civilian population centers.“So the fighter jets are not just to do dogfights against Russian fighter jets, but more importantly to protect forces and civilians,” he said.Russian forces have made progress in the battle for the eastern Ukrainian town of Bakhmut. In the past few days, some units of the Russian army and mercenaries from the Wagner Group have gained a foothold west of the Bakhmutka River in the center of the contested town, the British Defense Ministry said on Friday.""Over the preceding week, the river had marked the front line. Ukrainian Armed Forces continue to defend the west of the town,"" the ministry said in its daily intelligence update.However, more broadly across the front line, Russia is conducting some of the lowest rates of local offensive action that has been seen since at least January 2023, according to the update.The British ministry assumes it is is most likely because Russian forces have temporarily depleted the deployed formations' combat power to such an extent that even local offensive actions are not currently sustainable.Russian leaders will likely seek to regenerate the offensive potential of the force once personnel and munition stocks are replenished. In the meantime, commanders will likely be forced to choose between carrying out offensive operations and conducting a credible defence of the full line, the update said.Chinese President Xi Jinping plans to travel to Russia next week. The state visit is at the invitation of Russian President Vladimir Putin and is scheduled for next Monday to Wednesday, China's Foreign Ministry announced.It will be the first visit by the Chinese head of state and party leader to Moscow since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In February, China suggested a ceasefire and peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine in a position paper.However, there was disappointment in Western countries that the paper did not provide for the withdrawal of Russian troops from occupied territories in Ukraine. Most recently, Beijing reacted angrily to warnings from the US that China might be about to supply weapons to Russia.dh/jcg (AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters)",2023/3/17,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838924,German chancellor visits Japan to ramp up security ties,"When he arrives in Tokyo on Friday for three days of discussions with the Japanese premier and other officials, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz will be accompanied by no fewer than six members of his cabinet.This underlines the importance that both sides place on what will be the inaugural session of the intergovernmental consultations that the two leaders agreed to launch when they met in April last year.The agenda is expected to include bilateral economic and trade ties, the durability of supply chains, shared environmental concerns and preparations for the upcoming G7 summit, which Japan is hosting in Hiroshima in May.It is security issues, however, that will dominate the talks.""Kishida wants to obtain a first-hand understanding of Germany's policy towards China and on the Ukraine situation,"" Toshimitsu Shigemura, a professor of politics and international relations at Waseda University, told DW.""Japan is deeply worried that Germany and other countries still want to try to cooperate with China, despite the problems we are seeing in the Indo-Pacific region,"" he said, pointing to China's occupation and militarization of atolls and reefs across the South China Sea, the comprehensive crackdown on dissent in Hong Kong, the ongoing threats against Taiwan and increasingly aggressive territorial claims against a number of neighboring states, including Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, and India.""European countries have been critical of China, but they have not taken steps that would anger Beijing out of concern for the economic impact that could have,"" Shigemura said.""Germany, in particular, has been criticized here for its economic ties to China, and Japan would very much like to see those links lessened.""At a basic level, Japan does not understand why European nations say they are committed to human rights, democracy and the rights of people to freedom, but then countries like Germany 'forget' those promises to cooperate with China,"" Shigemura underlined.In a scathing editorial in November 2022, the Sankei Shimbun newspaper claimed that Scholz's visit to China that month ""raised concern that Germany may be willing to sacrifice Western unity for its own economic advantage.""The paper pointed out that Scholz was accompanied by a dozen top German business leaders, adding, ""Unfortunately, it may be concluded that Germany has become hopelessly infatuated with China's enormous economic power.""Kishida will, however, express his gratitude for the deployment of Germany military units to Japan in recent years for joint exercises with the Japanese and US militaries in the region. The German navy frigate Bayern visited Japan in May 2021 and German fighter aircraft took part in drills here last year.""I expect Kishida to ask Scholz for more of the same, for additional military units to train with Japanese and US forces here, because Japan is very happy to see European nations' flags flying here,"" said Robert Dujarric, co-director of the Institute of Contemporary Asian Studies at the Tokyo campus of Temple University.""These visits and joint exercises may be largely symbolic as no European country is able to send a large force to the Pacific, but it's an important message that Japan does have partners,"" he said.""The message is that Japan is building a coalition of what it likes to refer to as 'like-minded nations' in order to protect the idea of a 'free and open Indo-Pacific,'"" Dujarric added.Ukraine will be another critical topic during the talks, with Shigemura anticipating that Kishida will ask his German counterpart for advice and support on his plans to travel to Kyiv to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.Kishida has reportedly been keen to travel to Ukraine to demonstrate Japan's support for the war-torn nation, particularly as he is the only G7 leader to not have made the journey so far and the G7 summit is rapidly approaching.Japan's Foreign Ministry is extremely wary about the trip, however, not only due to the security challenges any such visit would entail but also because it is keen to avoid further antagonizing Russia.Japan also wants to learn from Germany how it was able to overcome its long-standing reluctance to exporting weapons to another country that is at war, with Tokyo similarly struggling to overcome the fine print of its constitution to permit the export of weapons systems to Ukraine.To date, Japanese support has been in the form of non-lethal aid — such as medical equipment, body armor and anti-landmine technology — along with financial assistance and the promise of more help to rebuild Ukraine as soon as the conflict is over.Scholz is likely to encourage Kishida to go ahead with weapons exports to Ukraine, Shigemura said, both to underline Japan's support for Ukraine but also to ease some of the pressures on European nations to keep providing weapons and ammunition.On the economic front, discussions on bilateral trade are expected to be more fruitful.Trade between both sides is huge and, at least until the outbreak of the COVID pandemic in early 2020, was growing.Germany is the top European exporter to Japan, with trade valued at €38.6 billion ($42.3 billion) a year before the global health crisis, while German direct investment into Japan came to €15.6 billion a year.At least 12,480 German companies export to Japan and 450 have gone as far as to set up a subsidiary there.In addition, German business is responsible for some 265,000 jobs in the Asian nation.A recent report by the German Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Tokyo showed that more German companies now see Japan as an advantageous place to do business in, given the country's economic, political and social stability.Cooperation between German and Japanese firms has also been on the rise since the difficult days of the pandemic, it noted.Edited by: Srinivas Mazumdaru",2023/3/17,,

On Tuesday, officials from both countries are set to take part in broader talks.""During the talks, they will discuss topical issues of further development of comprehensive partnership relations and strategic cooperation between Russia and China,"" the Kremlin said. ""A number of important bilateral documents will be signed,"" it added.China's Foreign Ministry described Xi's trip as ""a visit for peace"" that aimed to ""practice true multilateralism... improve global governance and make contributions to the development and progress of the world.""""At present, changes not seen in a century are rapidly evolving, and the world has entered a new period of turmoil,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said at a regular press conference.""China will uphold its objective and fair position on the Ukrainian crisis and play a constructive role in promoting peace talks.""China has previously offered to broker peace in Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But Beijing's refusal to condemn Russia's war has prompted the West to react to its mediation efforts with skepticism.Top ranking US officials have even accused China of supplying Russia with arms for its ongoing war in Ukraine. China has denied these claims.But Kyiv has sought to strengthen its ties with Beijing. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged China on the anniversary of Russia's war to take part in a summit to discuss Kyiv's so-called peace formula.Ukraine has said any plan to end the war must involve the full withdrawal of Russian troops to Ukraine's borders in 1991, the year the Soviet Union was dissolved.On Thursday, China's top diplomat Qin Gang held a rare phone conversation with his Ukrainian counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba.Qin told Kuleba that Beijing ""always upheld an objective and fair stance on the Ukraine issue, has committed itself to promoting peace and advancing negotiations and calls on the international community to create conditions for peace talks,"" according to China's Foreign Ministry.""I underscored the importance of Zelenskyy's's Peace Formula for ending the aggression and restoring just peace in Ukraine,"" wrote Kuleba, who spoke the same day with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken.In February 2022, Beijing and Moscow struck a ""no limits"" partnership when Putin was visiting China for the opening of the Winter Olympics — weeks before launching the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.Since then, both countries have reaffirmed the strength of their ties.In late December, Putin invited Xi to Russia over a conference video call to ""demonstrate to the whole world the strength of the Russian-Chinese ties."" He further said that the visit could ""become the main political event of the year in bilateral relations.""Trade between the two countries has increased since the invasion last year.

It was reported that the German cabinet did not approve of plans for a meeting with Foreign Minister Joseph Wu (吳釗燮), per the Financial Times.Nevertheless, in a reference to Taiwan ahead of a visit to Japan, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz warned China against changing the status quo in the region by force.Previous German federal government members to visit Taiwan include Economics Ministers Juergen Moellemann in 1992 and Guenter Rexrodt in 1994 and 1997.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838930,US envoy 'optimistic' about upcoming Serbia-Kosovo summit,"PRISTINA, Kosovo (AP) — A United States envoy of Friday urged Serbia and Kosovo to implement a European Union-facilitated agreement on normalizing their relations, calling it the best option to preserve peace and security in the region.Envoy Gabriel Escobar was in Pristina ahead of Saturday's summit meeting between Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic and Kosovar Prime Minister Albin Kurti in Ohrid, North Macedonia.“We think that this European proposal, facilitated through the EU dialog, offers a tremendous opportunity to create a peaceful, sustainable and productive relationship between two countries, two important countries of the region,” Escobar said after talks with Kosovo’s President Vjosa Osmani.Last month in Brussels, Vucic and Kurti gave their tacit approval to the EU plan to end months of political crisis and help improve ties. The summit will tackle the most contentious issue on which the two sides fundamentally disagree - the recognition of Kosovo's statehood.Vucic said Thursday he won’t “sign anything” during the summit. The EU plan calls for the two countries to maintain good neighborly relations, recognize each other’s official documents and national symbols, and would see Belgrade allow Pristina to seek membership in the EU and U.N..Kurti has hailed the agreement as a firm step toward a final deal on mutual recognition likely later this year. Concluding such a deal has gained added importance amid concerns that Russia could attempt to stir instability in the volatile region where it holds historic influence.Tensions have simmered between Serbia and Kosovo, whose independence is recognized by many Western countries, but is opposed by Belgrade with the backing of Russia and China.Kosovo is a majority ethnic Albanian former Serbian province which broke away in 2008. That came nine years after the end of a 1998-99 war, which erupted when separatist ethnic Albanians launched a rebellion against Serbia’s rule, and Belgrade responded with a brutal crackdown. About 13,000 people died, mostly ethnic Albanians.In 1999 a NATO intervention forced Serbia to pull out of the territory and ended the war, but tensions over Kosovo’s status remain a source of instability in the Balkans. ___ Semini reported from Tirana, Albania.",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838931,Cambodia celebrates return of 'priceless' stolen artifacts,"PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) — Centuries-old cultural artifacts that had been illegally smuggled out from Cambodia were welcomed home Friday at a celebration led by Prime Minister Hun Sen, who offered thanks for their return and appealed for further efforts to retrieve such stolen treasures.Many, if not all, of the items displayed at the government’s offices Friday had been looted from Cambodia during periods of war and instability, including in the 1970s when the country was under the brutal rule of the communist Khmer Rouge. Through unscrupulous art dealers, they made their way into the hands of private collectors and museums around the world.A statement from the Ministry of Culture and Fine Arts described the returned artifacts as embodying the “priceless cultural heritage and the souls of generations of Khmer ancestors.”The statement credited the items’ return to “tremendous cooperation and support” from public and private institutions, national and international experts, and close relations with other countries through bilateral, multi-lateral and international institutions, including UNESCO.It also singled out cooperation between the Cambodian and U.S. governments. Many of the items returned so far have come from the United States.The returned items included important Hindu and Buddhist statues, as well as ancient jewelry from the once-mighty empire of Angkor.In February, a spectacular collection of jewelry was returned to Cambodia from the estate of antiquities collector and dealer Douglas Latchford, who was accused of buying and selling looted artifacts. The 77 pieces of jewelry included crowns, necklaces, bracelets, belts, earrings and amulets. U.S. prosecutors indicted him in 2019 on charges related to alleged trafficking in stolen and looted Cambodian antiquities. Latchford, who died in 2020, had denied any involvement in smuggling.In remarks to an invited audience that included U.S. Ambassador W.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838933,Greece raises minimum wage to pre-bailout levels,"ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Greece announced on Friday an increase in the minimum wage that will restore pay to levels existing before sweeping cuts were imposed more than a decade ago during an international bailout.Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said the gross minimum monthly salary will go up on April 1 to 780 euros ($830) from 713 euros.“I have no illusions. We know that in our country, wages are still low, and they are being squeezed even more by inflation,” said Mitsotakis, whose center-right government faces a general election in the spring.Under pressure from lenders, Greece imposed severe pay cuts in 2012 during bailout programs funded by a European Union rescue fund and the International Monetary Fund.As the country was on the brink of bankruptcy, the government took control of wage policy ‒ previously set through labor negotiations ‒ and slashed the minimum monthly pay from 751 euros to 586 euros.Greek salaries are paid out over 14 installments annually, to provide extra at Christmas, Easter and the summer holidays.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838935,Russia to award pilots involved in US drone incident,"MOSCOW (AP) — Russian fighter pilots involved in an incident with a U.S. drone that resulted in its crash will be given state awards, the Defense Ministry announced Friday. The move appears to signal Moscow's intention to adopt a more aggressive stance toward future U.S. surveillance flights.The U.S. military said it ditched the Air Force MQ-9 Reaper in the Black Sea on Tuesday after a pair of Russian fighter jets dumped fuel on the surveillance drone and then one of them struck its propeller while it was flying in international airspace. Moscow has denied that its warplanes hit the drone, alleging that it crashed while making a sharp maneuver. It said that its aircraft reacted to a violation of a no-flight zone Russia has established in the area near Crimea amid the fighting in Ukraine.On Friday, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu lauded the pilots for preventing the drone from flying into the area that Moscow has banned for flights. The Defense Ministry emphasized that the ban was “in line with international norms.”Moscow's announcement comes a day after the U.S. military released a declassified 42-second color footage showing a Russian Su-27 fighter jet approaching the back of the U.S. drone and releasing fuel as it passes in what appeared to be aimed at blinding the drone’s optical instruments to drive it from the area.On a second approach, either the same jet or another Russian Su-27 that had been shadowing the MQ-9 struck the drone’s propeller, damaging a blade, according to the U.S. military, which said it then ditched the aircraft in the sea. The video excerpt does not show the collision, although it does show the damage to the propeller.The top U.S. and Russian defense and military leaders spoke Wednesday about the destruction of the drone in the first calls between them since October, underscoring the event’s seriousness.While calling out Russia for “reckless” action, the White House also tried to avoid exacerbating tensions. U.S. officials emphasized that they have not been able to determine whether the Russian pilot intentionally struck the American drone and stressed that lines of communication with Moscow remain open.Russian officials also emphasized the need to maintain lines of communication, but they harshly denounced the U.S. action as arrogant disregard of Moscow's no-flight zone.Dmitry Medvedev, deputy head of Russia's Security Council chaired by President Vladimir Putin, said Friday that, “simply put, the Americans have become far too gross, and we shouldn't be too polite with them."" He added on a more cautious note that “of course, contacts between the military are necessary.”Pro-Kremlin political analyst Sergei Markov pointed at the award for the pilots who buzzed the U.S. drone as ""a clear sign that Russia will keep downing the American drones.”“This decision will receive a strong support from the Russian society that wants the government to toughen its policy,” Markov wrote in a commentary.Moscow has repeatedly voiced concern about U.S. intelligence flights close to Crimea, which Russia seized from Ukraine in 2014 amid strong international condemnation. The Kremlin has charged the U.S. and its allies of effectively becoming engaged in the conflict by providing weapons and sharing intelligence with Kyiv.Some Russian officials charged that the U.S. surveillance flights helped gather intelligence that allowed Ukraine to strike Russian targets.",2023/3/18,,World

The English champions were drawn to face Bayern Munich, which has won all eight of its games in the competition this season and will play the first leg in Manchester.Bayern twice kept Paris Saint-Germain forwards Lionel Messi and Kylian Mbappé from scoring in the round of 16.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838939,China appeals for fair treatment after latest TikTok bans,"BEIJING (AP) — China appealed Friday to other governments to treat its companies fairly after Britain and New Zealand joined the United States in restricting use of TikTok due to fears the Chinese-owned short video service might be a security risk.Governments are worried TikTok’s owner, ByteDance, might give browsing history or other data about users to China’s government or promote propaganda and disinformation.“We call on the countries concerned to recognize the objective facts, effectively respect the market economy” and provide “a non-discriminatory environment"" for all companies, said foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin.TikTok is one focus of conflicts between China and other governments over technology and security that are disrupting processor chip, smartphone and other industries.Legislators and employees in New Zealand’s Parliament will be prohibited from having TikTok ’s app on phones, the government said Friday. Britain announced a ban Thursday on TikTok on all government phones.In February, the White House told federal agencies to delete TikTok from government-issued mobile devices within 30 days.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838940,German lawmakers approve plan to shrink bloated parliament,"BERLIN (AP) — Lawmakers in Germany approved electoral reforms Friday that would reduce the size of the country's increasingly bloated parliament, but two opposition parties were vehemently critical and the plan is expected to face a court challenge.Parliament's lower house, or Bundestag, currently has a record 736 members. The changes approved on a 400-261 vote with 23 abstentions would reduce that number to 630.Other proposals to reform the system have failed in recent years because of the difficulty of reconciling parties’ interests. Germany’s next national election is expected in the fall of 2025.In German elections, every voter gets two votes: one for a directly elected candidate, the other for a party list.Each of the country’s 299 constituencies elects its legislative representative directly by a simple majority vote. At least 299 further seats go to candidates elected on party lists. The list votes are critical because they determines the percentage of seats each party wins.At present, if a party wins more seats via the direct vote than it would get under the party vote, it keeps the extra seats — but more seats are added for other parties to ensure the proportional vote is reflected accurately.Because Germany’s traditional big parties have continued to dominate the direct vote even as their overall support has declined, that can result in the Bundestag having many more lawmakers than the minimum 598.To share in the division of seats, a party must win 5% of the party list vote or have at least three directly elected lawmakers.The reform drawn up by Chancellor Olaf Scholz's governing coalition would set the size of the Bundestag at a constant 630 seats.“The people of our country ... expect us to be capable of reform, and to show that we, too, are prepared to accept cutbacks,” said Dirk Wiese, a lawmaker with Scholz's Social Democrats.Under the new system, parties would have to win 5% of the vote to share in the division of seats and the three-winner option would be eliminated. And no extra seats would be added to allow all direct constituency winners to take their seats, meaning that the worst-performing candidates could miss out.That has incensed two opposition parties in particular: the conservative Christian Social Union, which runs only in Bavaria and holds nearly all that state's 46 directly elected seats; and the Left Party, which fell short of 5% support in the 2021 election but has a full parliamentary group because it emerged with three directly elected lawmakers.“You set out to shrink the German parliament; what you're doing now is shrinking the opposition in this parliament,” Alexander Dobrindt, the CSU’s top lawmaker in Berlin, said.The center-right bloc that includes the CSU made clear that it intends to take the matter to Germany's Federal Constitutional Court.",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838941,KMT changes course on corruption,"TAICHUNG (Taiwan News) — Once again, Kuomintang (KMT) Chair Eric Chu (朱立倫) is facing uproar in the party and calls for him to step down, something that seems to be happening every six months or so. This time, however, it is over something surprising, namely corrupt politics.On March 15, Chu released the names of the party’s central election strategy committee, normally a non-newsworthy event. The 10 names on the list were mostly mid-to-high level politicians, and were clearly picked because they had electoral experience and to balance the various factions and groupings in the party.On the list were a former Tainan City Council speaker and the notorious “King of Hualien,” Fu Kun-chi (傅崐萁). What caused the outbreak of dissent from politicians of all stripes throughout the KMT was that both had criminal records.This was surprising and must have caught Chu thoroughly off-guard. In the past, no one would have batted an eyelid, as this was normal for the KMT.Firing the first salvo, KMT Taipei City Councillor Chung Pei-chun (鍾沛君) expressed her fury at the inclusion of the two ex-convicts, and resigned as deputy director of the KMT’s culture committee. She was followed by her fiery counterpart and media darling Hsu Chiao-hsin (徐巧芯), who said it made her heart “half cold.”A torrent of criticism from within the party broke out, with one KMT politician or another coming out in opposition. Deep blue media figure and declared presidential candidate Jaw Shaw-kong (趙少康) called it “totally stupid” and called for the committee to be disbanded.Probably most damaging to Chu were the strong comments posted on Facebook by New Taipei mayor and widely tipped presidential frontrunner in the KMT, Hou Yu-ih (侯友宜), who wrote “no matter the political party, black gold (corruption) absolutely must not return to power.” Later Chu called Hou, a phone call Chu characterized as “smooth,” something Hou has not confirmed.By the afternoon of the same day, Chu was still trying to play it down and calling for party unity, presumably thinking it wouldn’t last more than one or two news cycles. Clearly thinking the same thing, the party also defended the pair, saying they had served their time, so there was no longer any controversy, and thanking them for their service on the committee.The next morning, the KMT was even more defensive, calling on people not to “act on hearsay” and “spread falsehoods” and saying that Eric Chu was “obviously” determined to see this through. Chu said that while the party leaders would engage in “self-reflection,” the committee member list wouldn’t be affected. Later, Chu seemed to relent slightly, saying the committee member list was still being adjusted.By the afternoon, it was clear what those adjustments were. The former Tainan speaker was out, and two new members were added, including the candidate who came fairly close to winning the Tainan mayoral race for the KMT in November, Hsieh Lung-chieh (謝龍介). Two problems, the “King of Hualien” Fu was still on the list, and by that evening Hsieh posted he was refusing to join the committee.With egg on his face and the situation clearly spinning out of control, Chu announced “all the mistakes are mine.” Meanwhile, at almost the same time, Fu gave a press conference, calling on Hou to immediately announce he was running for president, adding he would go all out to help him, and that if Hou felt the committee wasn’t ideal he should take command of it, because Taiwan needs a hero.Notice that neither Chu nor Fu suggested that Fu was off the committee. Why is that?Remarkably, at almost the same time as Chu and Fu were meeting the press, Jaw Shaw-kong was speculating on that at his own press conference. He asked if it was a situation of the tail wagging the dog, or the dog wagging the tail.A couple of hours later in a post on Facebook, Chung Pei-chun, who’d kicked off the storm, questioned if the party was under Chair Chu or Chair Fu, and said of Chu, “It looks like Fu is stomping on your head, can’t you feel it?”This story will continue to play out, but the question is: Why is the KMT suddenly so concerned about corruption? To understand that we have to go back to the last election, and look forward to the upcoming one.Just prior to the last election, some corruption scandals started emerging on the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) side, especially in Tainan and most especially surrounding the ‘88 shooting’ case.The KMT jumped at its chance to accuse the DPP of engaging in corruption. That is considered one of the reasons the DPP did so badly.The KMT had its own corruption scandals, of course, most notably in Yilan. Corruption accusations, however, are far more potent against the DPP than the KMT.This is because the KMT has been widely associated with corruption, going all the way back to the martial law period. The perception of the KMT is that they are better at administrating, but they often get their hands dirty, while corruption helps in terms of personal reward and extending power.Since the early days of the DPP, by contrast, the party has campaigned as the clean alternative to the KMT and specifically built a part of its image around combating corruption. The DPP is generally seen as more idealistic and clean, if not as strong at administration, because it strictly follows the rules.While there are exceptions to the rule for those stereotypes, in years of having done business with governments of both parties, there is a grain of truth to them. If the DPP gets associated with corruption, it gets the short end of the stick on both counts, turning off independents and encouraging their supporters to just stay home on election day — both of which appeared to be problems last November.In her initial attack that set this whole thing in motion, Chung Pei-chun suggested that from this day forward how can the KMT keep accusing the DPP of corruption (if the party puts former criminals in top posts)? Hsu Chiao-hsin noted it turned off young voters.One media commentator congratulated Ko Wen-je (柯文哲) of the Taiwan People’s Party (TPP) on the new slogan the KMT had just handed them: “Corruption doesn’t distinguish between blue or green.” The KMT has recently been trying to rebuild its brand, something Eric Chu himself promoted by handpicking candidates in the last election to weed out bad apples, but now Chu has scored an own goal.This newfound introspection on the issue of corruption in the KMT is a good thing. The party has a huge task ahead of it to remove it all, but this is a start.Taiwan can only be better for it.UPDATE: On the morning of the 18th, the KMT announced that the committee would be suspended and the party would go back to its previous method of selecting candidates. Hou Yu-ih was contacted to join a selection committee for legislative candidates, but he hasn’t yet confirmed one way or another.",2023/3/18,2245,Opinion

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838945,"20 years after U.S. invasion, young Iraqis see signs of hope","BAGHDAD (AP) — Along the Tigris River, young Iraqi men and women in jeans and sneakers danced with joyous abandon on a recent evening to a local rapper as the sun set behind them. It’s a world away from the terror that followed the U.S. invasion 20 years ago.Iraq’s capital is full of life, its residents enjoying a rare peaceful interlude in a painful modern history. The city’s open-air book market is crammed with shoppers. Affluent young men cruise muscle cars. A few glitzy buildings sparkle where bombs once fell.President George W. Bush called the U.S.-led invasion launched March 20, 2003, a mission to free the Iraqi people. It threw out a dictator whose rule kept 20 million people in fear for a quarter-century. But it also broke a unified state in the heart of the Arab world. About 300,000 Iraqis were killed between 2003 and 2023, along with more than 8,000 U.S. military, contractors and civilians.Half of today's population isn’t old enough to remember life under Saddam Hussein. In interviews from Baghdad to Fallujah, young Iraqis deplored the chaos that followed Saddam’s ouster, but many were hopeful about nascent freedoms and opportunities.___Editor’s note: John Daniszewski and Jerome Delay were in Baghdad 20 years ago when the U.S. bombing began. They returned for this report on how Iraq has changed –—especially for young people.____In a chandeliered reception room, President Abdul Latif Rashid, who assumed office in October, spoke glowingly of Iraq’s prospects. Perception of Iraq as a war-torn country is frozen in time, he told The Associated Press: Iraq is rich; peace has returned.If young people are “a little bit patient, I think life will improve drastically in Iraq.”Most Iraqis aren’t nearly as bullish. Conversations start with bitterness about how the U.S. left Iraq in tatters. But speaking to younger Iraqis, one senses a generation ready to turn a page.Safaa Rashid, 26, is a writer who talks politics with friends at a coffee shop in Baghdad's Karada district.After the invasion, Iraq lay broken, violence reigning, he said. Today is different; he and like-minded peers freely talk about solutions. “I think the young people will try to fix this situation.”Noor Alhuda Saad, 26, a Ph.D. candidate and political activist, says her generation has been leading protests decrying corruption, demanding services and seeking inclusive elections — and they won't stop until they’ve built a better Iraq.___Blast walls have given way to billboards, restaurants, cafes, shopping centers. With 7 million inhabitants, Baghdad is the Middle East’s second-largest city; streets teem with commerce.In northern and western Iraq, there are occasional clashes with remnants of the Islamic State group. It's but one of Iraq’s lingering problems. Another is corruption; a 2022 audit found a network of former officials and businessmen stole $2.5 billion.In 2019-20, young people protested against corruption and lack of services. After 600 were killed by government forces and militias, parliament agreed to election changes to allow more groups to share power.___The sun bakes down on Fallujah, the main city of the Anbar region — once a hotbed of activity for al-Qaida of Iraq and, later, the Islamic State group. Beneath the girders of the city’s bridge across the Euphrates, three 18-year-olds return home from school for lunch.In 2004, this bridge was the site of a gruesome tableau. Four Americans from military contractor Blackwater were ambushed, their bodies dragged through the street and hung. For the 18-year-olds, it’s a story they’ve heard from families — irrelevant to their lives.One wants to be a pilot, two aspire to be doctors. Their focus is on good grades.Fallujah gleams with apartments, hospitals, amusement parks, a promenade. But officials were wary of letting Western reporters wander unescorted, a sign of lingering uncertainty.""We lost a lot — whole families,” said Dr. Huthifa Alissawi, a mosque leader recalling the war years.These days, he enjoys the security: “If it stays like now, it is perfect.”___Sadr City, a working-class suburb in eastern Baghdad, is home to more than 1.5 million people. On a pollution-choked avenue, two friends have side-by-side shops. Haider al-Saady, 28, fixes tires. Ali al-Mummadwi, 22, sells lumber.They scoff when told of the Iraqi president’s promises that life will be better.“It is all talk,” al-Saady said.His companion agrees: “Saddam was a dictator, but the people were living better, peacefully.”___Khalifa OG raps about difficulties of life and satirizes authority, but isn’t blatantly political. A song he performed next to the Tigris mocks “sheikhs” wielding power in the new Iraq through wealth or connections.Abdullah Rubaie, 24, could barely contain his excitement. “Peace for sure makes it easier” for parties like this, he said. His stepbrother Ahmed Rubaie, 30, agreed.“We had a lot of pain ... it had to stop,” Ahmed Rubaie said. These young people say sectarian hatred is a thing of the past. They're unafraid to make their voices heard.___Mohammed Zuad Khaman, 18, toils in his family’s café in a poor Baghdad neighborhood. He resents the militias’ hold on power as an obstacle to his sports career. Khaman's a footballer, but says he can’t play in Baghdad’s amateur clubs — he has no “in” with militia-related gangs.“If only I could get to London, I would have a different life.”The new Iraq offers more promise for educated young Iraqis like Muammel Sharba, 38.A lecturer at Middle Technical University in once violence-torn Baquba, Sharba left Iraq for Hungary to earn a Ph.D. on an Iraqi scholarship. He returned last year, planning to fulfil obligations to his university and then move back to Hungary.Sharba became an biker in Hungary but never imagined he could pursue his passion at home. Now, he's found a cycling community. He notices better technology and less bureaucracy, too.So he plans to remain.“I don’t think European countries were always as they are now,” he said. “I believe that we need to go through these steps, too.”____John Daniszewski is AP’s vice president for standards and editor at large.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838962,Japan deploys new troops to revamped base on island near Taiwan,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Tokyo deployed new troops armed with missile batteries to its southernmost islands, known as the Nansei Island chain, not far from Taiwan’s east coast, it was reported on Friday (March 17).As part of Japan’s policies to bolster its military posture in the region, around 570 Ground Self-Defense Force soldiers have been stationed at a newly renovated base on Ishigaki Island, about 320 km from Taiwan. Tokyo confirmed on Thursday (March 16), that the troops have been stationed on the southern islands of Okinawa prefecture, reported CNN.

The troops are trained to operate land-to-air and land-to-ship missiles, according to reports. Earlier reports indicate that Type 12 short-range, anti-ship missiles have been placed on nearby Miyako Island and that there were already over 150 troops on Yonaguni Island, which is just over 100 km from Taiwan.Tokyo considers the troop deployment as a deterrent to any potential Chinese naval blockade of Taiwan. Missiles on Ishigaki Island would imperil any Chinese naval vessels targeting the eastern coast of Taiwan.Japan sees China’s increasing aggression toward Taiwan as a serious threat to regional instability and its own national interests. Under Prime Minister Kishida Fumio, the decision has been made to prepare for the possibility of conflict with China.

Plans for an expanded military presence around islands near Taiwan have been in motion since 2019. In 2022, it was reported that, in addition to the missile-capable troops, a quick response strike group and an electronic warfare unit will also be deployed by the end of 2023.

Japan and the U.S. have previously discussed joint weapons storage on the islands near Taiwan and it is expected that a U.S. Marine littoral regiment will eventually be deployed to the area as well.",2023/3/17,3736,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838963,Taiwan will ask for extradition of deserter who swam to China,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Prosecutors have issued a warrant for the arrest of a soldier who swam to China, and will ask the communist country to extradite the alleged deserter, reports said Friday (March 17).The soldier, named as Chen Chia-hsun (陳嘉壎), missed the March 9 morning roll call on the island of Erdan in Kinmen County, less than 5 kilometers from the coast of the Chinese province of Fujian. Initial fears centered on Chen having been swept away by the waves, but it soon emerged he voluntarily swam in the direction of China and was picked up by the Chinese coast guard.Kinmen prosecutors said Friday they issued an arrest warrant valid for 20 years. They will contact the Ministry of Justice next week to help facilitate Chen's extradition from China.Their investigation, which included a visit to Erdan on Friday, indicated that Chen might have fled because of financial problems, though it was not possible to reach valid conclusions as long as they were unable to question him, CNA reported. Relationship issues, disciplinary problems, and attempted suicide had been ruled out as motives,and no accomplices have been implicated, according to the investigators.",2023/3/17,2155,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838979,Jim Ratcliffe jets in for Manchester United buyout talks,"MANCHESTER, England (AP) — Jim Ratcliffe toured Manchester United on Friday as part of his bid to buy the English soccer club.The billionaire owner of INEOS jetted in for talks with club executives at Old Trafford, along with some of his closest advisors.Ratcliffe was greeted by United chief executive Richard Arnold on Friday morning and briefly met with manager Erik ten Hag at the club's Carrington training base.“I just met them and shook hands,” Ten Hag said at a news conference ahead of Sunday's FA Cup quarterfinal match with Fulham. “We play a big game on Sunday and all our focus is on that. Others in the club are dealing with potential investors.” Ratcliffe posed for photographs at Old Trafford before heading to Carrington in a car with blacked out windows.He is getting a closer look at United before submitting a formal offer to current owners the Glazer family.Ratcliffe is one of Britain's richest people and is bidding to buy a majority share of the 20-time English league champions. His meetings come as the potential sale enters its next phase after bids were submitted via American merchant bank Raine last month.Ratcliffe's delegation included Dave Brailsford, the director of sport at INEOS.Representatives of Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad Al Thani met with United executives on Thursday. The chairman of Qatar Islamic Bank and son of a former Qatari prime minister is aiming to take 100% ownership of United and has plans to invest in the stadium and training ground.Ratcliffe has said he would take a “fan-centered approach” to ownership and that he is “focusing on winning the Champions League.”It is still not certain if the Glazers will cede total control of United as it considers “strategic alternatives.”The American family, which also own the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, bought United in 2005 and has resisted repeated attempts from fans to drive them out.Last year, Raine handled the sale of Chelsea to Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital for about $3 billion.United is estimated to reach up to $6 billion.___James Robson is at https://twitter.com/jamesalanrobson___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838980,European team ends questioning of Lebanon Central Bank chief,"BEIRUT (AP) — A European legal team on Friday ended two days of questioning of Lebanon’s central bank chief in Beirut in a money-laundering probe linked to the governor.Several European countries are investigating Gov. Riad Salameh, who in recent years has been charged with corruption-related crimes. Salameh, 72, has been the head of Lebanon’s Central Bank since 1993.Salameh was questioned for two hours Friday and six hours the day before, Lebanese judicial officials said. The European delegation — with representatives from France, Germany, and Luxembourg — questioned Salameh through a Lebanese judge, acting as a go-between. Under Lebanese laws, the representatives cannot directly question Salameh.On Thursday, the team asked Salameh about an apartment in Paris’ Champs Elysee rented by the central bank and Forry Associates Ltd, a brokerage firm owned by Salameh's brother, Raja, on whether the company existed, the officials said. They added that Salameh was “confident” when he responded to the questions in French.Salameh’s questioning was scheduled to begin Wednesday but he did not show up.The European team has set April 15 to start questioning the governor's brother, Raja Salameh and the governor's associate, Marianne Hoayek, the officials said on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.Salameh, who has repeatedly denied charges of corruption, has not made any public statements since his questioning started this week.Judge Helena Iskandar, who is representing the Lebanese state in the European questioning, charged on Wednesday Salameh, as well as Raja Salameh and Hoayek, with corruption.In addition to the European probe, there are other legal proceedings against Salameh underway in Lebanon. In late February, Beirut’s public prosecutor, Raja Hamoush, charged the same three suspects — the governor, his brother and the aide — with corruption, including embezzling public funds, forgery, illicit enrichment, money-laundering and violation of tax laws.The European delegation is investigating the laundering of some $330 million.Lebanon is grappling with the worst economic and financial crisis in its modern history. The economic meltdown that began in late 2019 is rooted in decades of corruption and mismanagement by the country’s political class. More than 75% of the tiny nation’s population of 6 million has been plunged into poverty.",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838981,Prince Harry sues tabloid for defamation over security story,"LONDON (AP) — Lawyers for Prince Harry asked a judge Friday to rule that a tabloid newspaper libeled the British royal with an article about his quest for police protection when he and his family visit the U.K.Harry is suing Mail on Sunday publisher Associated Newspapers Ltd. over an article alleging he tried to hush up his separate legal challenge over the British government's refusal to let him pay for police security.During a hearing at the High Court in London, Harry’s lead attorney asked Judge Matthew Nickin either to strike out the publisher’s defense or to deliver a summary judgment, which would be a ruling in the prince’s favor without going to trial.Lawyer Justin Rushbrooke said the facts did not support the publisher’s “substantive pleaded defense” that the article expressed an “honest opinion.”He said the article was “fundamentally inaccurate.”Harry was not in court for the hearing. The prince, also known as the Duke of Sussex, and his wife, Meghan, lost their publicly funded U.K. police protection when they stepped down as senior working royals and moved to North America in 2020.Harry’s lawyers have said the prince is reluctant to bring the couple’s children — Prince Archie, who is almost 4, and Princess Lilibet, nearly 2 — to his homeland because it is not safe.The 38-year-old prince wants to pay personally for police security when he comes to Britain, but the government said that wasn't possible. Last year, a judge gave Harry permission to sue the government. That case has yet to come to trial.Harry sued Associated Newspapers over a February 2022 Mail on Sunday article headlined “Exclusive: How Prince Harry tried to keep his legal fight with the government over police bodyguards a secret… then – just minutes after the story broke – his PR machine tried to put a positive spin on the dispute.”Harry claims that the newspaper libeled him when it suggested that the prince lied in his initial public statements about the suit against the government.In July, Nicklin ruled that the article was defamatory, allowing the case to proceed. The judge has not yet considered issues such as whether the story was accurate or in the public interest.The publisher’s lawyer, Andrew Caldecott, said the argument by Harry's attorneys amounted to ""straitjacketing the newspaper’s right to comment.”He said it was vital the media speak truth to power, and “speaking opinion to power is every bit (as), if not more, important,” as long as the opinion is based on facts.At the end of the daylong hearing, the judge said he would rule at a later date.Harry, the younger son of King Charles III, and the former actress Meghan Markle married at Windsor Castle in 2018 but stepped down as working royals in 2020, citing what they described as the unbearable intrusions and racist attitudes of the British media.Harry’s fury at the U.K. press runs through his memoir “Spare, ” published in January. He blames an overly aggressive press for the 1997 death of his mother, Princess Diana, and also accuses the media of hounding Meghan.The couple has not hesitated to use the British courts to hit back at what they see as media mistreatment. In December 2021, Meghan won an invasion-of-privacy case against Associated Newspapers over the Mail on Sunday’s publication of a letter she wrote to her estranged father.Harry is also among celebrities suing Associated Newspapers over alleged phone hacking, and he has launched a separate hacking suit against the publisher of another tabloid, the Mirror. ___Follow the AP’s coverage of Prince Harry at https://apnews.com/hub/prince-harry",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838982,"Death toll rises, locals pick up pieces after Cyclone Freddy","BLANTYRE, Malawi (AP) — Authorities are still getting to grips with the scale of Cyclone Freddy's destruction in Malawi and Mozambique since late Saturday, with over 370 people confirmed dead, several hundreds still missing and tens of thousands displaced.On Friday, Malawi authorities said Freddy killed at least 326 people, with 200 still missing. There are hundreds of evacuation centers set up across the country for survivors. Malawi’s president, Lazarus Chakwera, declared a 14-day national mourning period on Thursday.In Mozambique, authorities said at least 53 were killed since Saturday, with 50,000 more still displaced. It’s expected that the death toll in both nations will continue to climb.Cyclone Freddy dissipated over land late Wednesday after it made second landfall in Mozambique and then Malawi over the weekend and caused mass devastation in several regions, including Malawi's financial capital, Blantyre.“A lot of areas are inaccessible restricting movement of assessment and humanitarian teams and life-saving supplies,” said Paul Turnbull, the World Food Program’s director in Malawi. “The true extent of the damage will only be revealed once assessments have been concluded.""Both nations were already facing a cholera outbreak before the cyclone hit and there are fears than the flooding could worsen the spread of water-borne diseases. Mozambique was also dealing with Freddy's first battering and floods earlier in the year.Scientists say human-caused climate change has worsened cyclone activity, making them wetter, more intense and more frequent.Cyclone Freddy has ravaged southern Africa since late February, when it pummeled Mozambique, Madagascar and Réunion. It then looped back on to the mainland after regaining strength over the Mozambique Channel.Freddy first developed near Australia in early February and the World Meteorological Organization has convened an expert panel to determine whether it has broken the record for the longest-ever cyclone in recorded history.___Alexandre Nhampossa and Tom Gould contributed to this report from Maputo, Mozambique.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838983,Thailand's opposition party unveils policies and candidates,"PATHUM THANI, Thailand (AP) — Thailand’s main opposition party on Friday paraded its slate of parliamentary candidates and outlined its policy pledges in a well-choreographed show of confidence ahead of the approaching general election.Several thousand supporters clad in red cheered and waved banners as the 400 candidates of the Pheu Thai party marched behind flag-bearers into an indoor university stadium on the outskirts of Bangkok, where they took their seats on stage.Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha is expected to dissolve Parliament by Monday, shortly before its term expires, triggering polls likely to be scheduled for early May.Pheu Thai is closely linked to Thaksin Shinawatra, the former prime minister ousted by a military coup in 2006. Thaksin, a telecommunications tycoon who upended tradition-bound Thai politics with populist policies, is despised by the military and ruling conservative establishment, whose influence he threatened. He now lives in exile to avoid a prison term on charges he calls politically motivated.His sister, Yingluck Shinawatra, also served as prime minister from 2011 to 2014, when she was forced from office by a controversial legal ruling.Despite attempts by his opponents to root out his family’s influence in Thai politics, Thaksin retains significant support, especially among poorer voters. As a consequence, Pheu Thai is being tipped by many analysts to win the most seats of any party and has been touting its prospects of a landslide victory.Thaksin’s daughter, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, is expected to be its main candidate for the prime minister’s post.On Friday, she outlined policies including improving labor conditions, guaranteeing a higher minimum wage, reducing pollution and turning Thailand into a financial technology hub.“I hope everyone wins their elections by a landslide, winning the people’s hearts by a lot,” she said to the assembled candidates, receiving enthusiastic applause. “Together we will fix the problems that have piled up over the last eight years, make them diminish and disappear.”Even if Pheu Thai wins the most seats, it may not necessarily provide the prime minister. The top post is chosen by a combined vote of the elected lawmakers and the appointed 250-strong Senate. The Senate is widely expected to vote as a bloc in favor of a conservative candidate and against anyone from the Shinawatra camp.Prime Minister Prayuth has led the country since seizing power in a 2014 military coup that toppled the Pheu Thai government led by Yingluck Shinawatra. Prayuth then continued as prime minister after the 2019 election, which was conducted under laws his junta had introduced to favor his return to power.",2023/3/17,,World

In case something happens close to the World Cup, we want to have enough players that we have seen and can trust to do a role,” Hathurusingha said. “We are rushed to do that as we have only 15 matches before the World Cup. We are trying to give opportunities to players we think can do the role.”Bangladesh is high on confidence following its first T20 series win against England last week. However, it lost the ODI series 2-1.Bangladesh has won seven out of 10 matches against Ireland, which is touring Bangladesh for the first time since 2008. Ireland’s last victory in this format against Bangladesh came in 2010 at Belfast.“We respect Ireland just like England but we don’t fear any team,"" Hathurusingha said. ""We are not going to treat Ireland any less than how we prepared for England. When we play our best cricket, we are good enough to beat most teams. It is our mantra.”Ireland started the Bangladesh tour on a positive note, beating a BCB XI by 78 runs in the warm-up game. But the tourists know that the biggest challenge will be to overcome the Bangladeshi spinners.Bangladesh also has in-form fast bowlers in Taskin Ahmed, Hasan Mahmud and Mustafizur Rahman, who all bowled well in the series against England.“Probably expect it to spin a bit, as you naturally do here in Bangladesh. But I think the most important thing is just being sort of adaptable to whatever is thrown at you condition-wise,” Ireland allrounder Harry Tector said. “Could spin and it could not spin. Could be a tough wicket, it could be a good wicket. We just have to wait and see.”Tector has experience of playing in Bangladesh as he took part in the 2016 Under-19 World Cup that the country hosted and was part of the Ireland Emerging team in 2021.“Thankfully I’ve played here twice before, so I have a fair idea of what to expect,"" he said.

Sajjan, Canada’s minister of international development, said, adding that the coronavirus pandemic and “competing international priorities” have overshadowed Venezuela’s situation.“We need to take need to make sure that the world is aware of this massive challenge facing the Americas,"" Saijan said.Once one of the most prosperous countries in Latin America, Venezuela plunged into a crisis last decade as a result of mismanagement by its socialist-led government and a decline in oil prices. Today, three-quarters of Venezuela’s lives on less than $1.90 a day — the international benchmark of extreme poverty.Most homes do not have reliable running water, and many experience regular power outages. The health care system crumbled long before the pandemic began.The minimum wage paid in Venezuelan bolivars is the equivalent of $5 a month, down from $30 in April 2022. Neither of those wages is enough to feed one person, let alone a family. The cost of a basic basket of goods for a family of four was estimated at $372 in December.Meanwhile, Venezuelan migrants often suffer discrimination for their nationality, have difficulties entering the formal economy and cannot afford housing, food, health care and other basic services. They are also increasingly embarking on second migration journeys within the continent, primarily to the U.S.Funding pledges by the end of the conference amounted to $855 million.The U.S. government offered more than $171 million, part of which will go for food, water and sanitation efforts within the crisis-wracked country. That money will also cover emergency shelter, health care and other services for Venezuelans who have migrated to other South American nations.“We must continue to provide critical assistance to Venezuelan refugees, migrants, their host communities and those still in Venezuela,” U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said via livestream from New York. “The work we are doing together will save lives and will change lives.”Part of the funding from the U.S. will go to U.N. agencies and nongovernmental groups already operating in Venezuela.Like other diplomats, Thomas-Greenfield urged conference attendees to work together to “advance a peaceful political solution in Venezuela.”President Nicolás Maduro’s government and Venezuela’s opposition, including the faction backed by the U.S., reached an agreement four months ago to fund social programs with money drawn from the country’s assets frozen abroad. But the fund, expected to be managed by the United Nations and to progressively reach about $3 billion, has yet to materialize.Gianluca Rampolla, the U.N.’s humanitarian coordinator in Venezuela, told attendees the agency’s plan last year was only funded at 34% after losing $50 million in assistance from donors.A U.N. report published in September estimated it would cost $795 million to help about 5.2 million people in Venezuela through health, education, water and sanitation, food and other projects, while a coalition of organizations assisting Venezuelans outside their home country in November estimated the needs of migrants at $1.7 billion.Venezuelan diplomats did not participate in the conference organized by the European Union and Canada. Representatives of Colombia and Brazil, whose recently elected presidents restarted diplomatic relations with Venezuela, urged attendees to include Maduro’s government in the dialogue around humanitarian assistance and migration.“For all of us present here, it is clear that we are at a solidarity conference towards Venezuelan refugees and migrants in which Venezuela is not present,” said Álvaro Leyva Durán, foreign minister of Colombia, where the largest share of migrants has resettled during the crisis. “...Let us reflect on the approach that we must have to achieve an inclusive, open and transparent dialogue.”",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838989,Turkey's president says he will back Finland's NATO bid,"ISTANBUL (AP) — Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Friday that his government would move forward with ratifying Finland’s NATO application, paving the way for the country to join the military bloc ahead of Sweden.The breakthrough came as Finnish President Sauli Niinisto was in Ankara to meet with Erdogan. Both Finland and Sweden applied to become NATO members 10 months ago in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, abandoning decades of nonalignmen t.NATO requires the unanimous approval of its 30 existing members to expand, and Turkey and Hungary are the only countries that have not yet ratified the Nordic nations' bids. The Turkish government accused both Sweden and Finland of being too soft on groups that it deems to be terror organizations, but expressed more reservations about Sweden.“When it comes to fulfilling its pledges in the trilateral memorandum of understanding, we have seen that Finland has taken authentic and concrete steps,” Erdogan told a news conference in Ankara following his meeting with Niinisto.“This sensitivity for our country’s security and, based on the progress that has been made in the protocol for Finland’s accession to NATO, we have decided to initiate the ratification process in our parliament,“ the president added.With Erdogan’s agreement, Finland’s application can now go to the Turkish parliament, where the president’s party and its allies hold a majority. Ratification is expected before Turkey holds its presidential and parliamentary elections scheduled for May 14.Commenting on Turkey's willingness to consider ratifying Sweden’s accession to NATO, Erdogan said it would “depend on the solid steps Sweden will take.”Explaining the difference between the Nordic countries from Ankara's viewpoint, Erdogan claimed that Sweden had “embraced terrorism,” and cited demonstrations by supporters of Kurdish militants on the streets of Stockholm. “Such demonstrations do not take place in Finland,” he said. “For that reason we had to consider (Finland) separately from Sweden.”Niinisto welcomed Turkey's willingness to move on his country's bid but also expressed solidarity with its neighbor. “I have a feeling that Finnish NATO membership is not complete without Sweden,” he said.Referring to a NATO summit scheduled for July in Lithuania's capital, Niinisto added: “I would like to see in Vilnius that we will meet the alliance of 32 members.”Turkey, Finland and Sweden signed a memorandum of understanding in June of last year to resolve differences over the Nordic states’ membership.The document included clauses addressing Ankara’s claims that Stockholm and Helsinki did not take seriously enough its concerns with those it considers terrorists, particularly supporters of Kurdish militants who have waged a 39-year insurgency in Turkey and people Ankara associates with a 2016 coup attempt.A series of separate demonstrations in Stockholm, including a protest by an anti-Islam activist who burned the Quran outside the Turkish Embassy, also angered Turkish officials.Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and lawmakers have promised to ratify the two country's NATO membership applications. But the country's parliament has repeatedly postponed a ratification vote.The parliamentary head of Orban's Fidesz party said Friday that a vote on Finnish accession would be held on March 27. Mate Kocsis said in a Facebook post that lawmakers for Fidesz, which holds a two-thirds majority in parliament, would ""vote unanimously in favor.”Niinisto arrived in Turkey on Thursday and toured areas affected by a magnitude 7.8 earthquake that killed more than 52,000 people in Turkey and Syria last month.“I have known Erdogan for a long time. I am sure he has important messages,” Niinisto said Thursday while visiting Kahramanmaras, one of the provinces worst-hit by the magnitude 7.6 earthquake on Feb. 6 that killed more than 52,000 people in Turkey and Syria.Prior to Friday's announcement, Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said Sweden hoped for “a rapid ratification process” after Turkey’s elections.NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the decision would strengthen the security of NATO, Finland and Sweden. “The most important thing is that both Finland and Sweden become full members of NATO quickly, not whether they join at exactly the same time,” he said.Turkey’s parliament is set to go into a pre-election recess in three weeks but an “accelerated process” to endorse Finland’s NATO membership was expected, Ozgur Unluhisarcikli, director of the German Marshall Fund in Ankara, said.He predicted a tougher path for Sweden after the elections, regardless of whether Erdogan is returned to office after 20 years in power or the opposition takes charge.“While there is now a president who commands a majority in parliament, the next president, whoever is elected, will likely not have a majority in parliament,” Unluhisarcikli said.Three political alliances made up of more than a dozen parties are taking part in the elections, including a left-wing alliance of politicians who tend to be ideologically opposed to NATO.“Now it’s enough to persuade to President Erdogan, but several parties will need to be persuaded after the election,” Unluhisarcikli said.———Associated Press writer Justin Spike contributed to this report from Budapest, Hungary.",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838990,Washington turns to Wall Street to help rescue dying bank,"The scene was reminiscent of the last financial crisis, nearly 15 years ago: Faced with a blossoming emergency in the banking sector, worried regulators and policymakers in Washington turned to Wall Street for help.The anxiety this week centered on First Republic Bank in San Francisco, which was once the envy of the banking sector, with its wealthy and well-traveled clientele. Now the bank was reeling after some of those customers withdrew billions of dollars.As early as Tuesday, it became clear to policymakers that First Republic needed to be rescued or it could fail, two people briefed on the matter told The Associated Press, speaking anonymously because they were not authorized to discuss details.The result was a swift agreement among the nation's leading banks to lay aside competitive instincts to come to First Republic's aid. With Washington greasing the wheels, a coalition of lenders put $30 billion in uninsured deposits into the California-based bank as a show of support.The money gives First Republic a lifeline while it reportedly seeks a buyer. Regulators hope it also bolsters confidence in the health of the broader banking system.The recent turmoil in the banking industry isn’t on par with the crisis that sparked the Great Recession from 2007 to 2009. But after Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank failed and were seized by the federal government, the industry’s overseers worried about more dominoes falling.Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen discussed the idea of supporting First Republic with other bank regulators — the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Comptroller of the Currency. Together they concluded that some sort of private rescue package was needed to prevent the crisis from worsening.Among the first calls made by Yellen and other policymakers was to Jamie Dimon, the chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase & Co. There may have been a sense of déjà vu: Back in 2008, Dimon was the go-to banker for Washington to find private solutions for that banking crisis.“We have our marching orders,"" Dimon reportedly said after the call with Yellen. He then proceeded to build a coalition of banks willing to place deposits with First Republic.This rescue would be simple compared with the 2008 crisis. First Republic needed money to replace any deposits that were being pulled out. The Wall Street banks have been flush for years, and deposits are one of the cheapest forms of capital a bank can get.It was clear First Republic was struggling with short-term fears. Between March 10 and Wednesday, the bank borrowed $109 billion from the Federal Reserve's so-called “discount window,"" a mechanism that allows banks to get 90-day loans using high-quality bonds as collateral. The window is often used in times of crisis.First Republic wasn't alone. As of Wednesday, the Fed had loaned $153 billion through the window, more than during the 2008 financial crisis.A spokesman for First Republic did not respond to requests for comment on the package or the bank’s financial health.Such rescues are intended to protect the system against further bank runs. But they do not address banks’ ""vulnerability to excessive interest rate risk, which was the root cause of these banks’ distress,” analysts at the credit rating agency Moody’s wrote this week as they put half a dozen midsize banks on a list for a potential downgrade.Over the next 48 hours, the roster of institutions willing to come to the rescue grew to 11 banks, representing a broad swath of the U.S. banking industry. It was an effort to show that the banking industry would stand behind even its competition as a sign of confidence.“We are deploying our financial strength and liquidity into the larger system, where it is needed the most,” the banks said Thursday in a statement.The coalition included some of the “super regional” banks such as Truist, US Bank and PNC. These were banks that had grown through mergers in recent years and constituted the second tier of large national banks, behind the “too big to fail” institutions like JPMorgan, Citi and Wells Fargo. Even the custodial banks — normally quiet institutions such as BNY Mellon and State Street that hold assets for investors and don’t have retail operations — came to the rescue of First Republic.But it’s not clear yet that the bleeding has stopped, even at First Republic.Shares of First Republic fell more than 30% Friday after the bank cut its annual dividend as part of the rescue package. Its shares are down nearly 70% this week alone. Analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods said the rescue and dividend cut “paint a grim outlook for both the company and shareholders.”Investors sold off banking stocks this week with most of the damage focused on smaller regional banks such as Zions Bank, Fifth Third, Huntington Bank and Comerica. The broad worry is that smaller regional banks, which hold large amounts of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities, may be forced by investors to revalue those bond portfolios.The FDIC estimates that American banks have $620 billion in unrealized losses on their balance sheets. Many of those losses stem from bonds that have lost significant value as the Fed has raised interest rates to combat inflation. Banks don’t have to account for the declining value since the bonds would be held to maturity and not traded at a loss.But in the case of Silicon Valley Bank, the bank faced a growing number of withdrawals and had to sell its bond portfolio to free up cash for depositors. That required the bank to post a $1.8 billion loss on that $21 billion bond sale.Smaller and mid-sized banks joined Republic in seeing their stocks fall again Friday.“There’s still a lot of unknowns,” said Ross Mayfield, investment strategy analyst at Baird, describing the uncertainty surrounding the types of investments banks have and how easily they can be turned into cash.“Most investors who have been in the business for a while, it’s hard not to call back to memory 2008, 2009, even if it does look quite different,"" Mayfield said.___AP business writers Christopher Rugaber in Washington and Stan Choe in New York contributed to this report.",2023/3/18,,World

The report is based on interviews with more than 200 victims and witnesses and other sources.“Our report paints an unacceptable picture of impunity and the near-total destruction of civic space and fundamental freedoms in Belarus,” Türk said in a statement, calling on the Minsk government to end “this mass repression” and to carry out impartial investigations to ensure accountability.Critics say the repression is continuing, and rights advocates in Belarus sounded the alarm on Tuesday about a new heavy crackdown on dissent by the authoritarian government that saw over 100 people detained in a week.Authorities targeted opposition activists, journalists, medical workers, members of shooting sports clubs and people working with drones, according to Viasna, Belarus’ oldest and most prominent rights group.The U.N. report pointed to the beatings of thousands of peaceful protesters in August 2020 — the largest demonstrations ever in the country — following widely contested elections that gave authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko another term.It lamented more than a dozen legislative amendments adopted over the last two years that target political activists and opponents, and said that nearly 1,500 people are currently in detention on “politically motivated charges.” Nearly 800 nongovernmental groups had been shut down as of last month, the report said.A Belarusian court on Friday sentenced the chief editor and the chief director of Tut.By - the country's leading independent news website until authorities shut it down last year - to 12 years in prison on charges of damaging national security and inciting hatred. Another court sentenced two independent political analysts to 10 years after they were found guilty of similar charges.The conviction of the two Tut.By journalists “is the latest attempt by the regime to kill honest journalism in Belarus,” said exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya.Lukashenko, a longtime ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin who backed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, has ruled the ex-Soviet country since 1994.",2023/3/17,,World

But Wuhan is home to several labs involved in collecting and studying coronaviruses, fueling theories scientists say are plausible that the virus may have leaked from one.The new findings do not settle the question, and they have not been formally reviewed by other experts or published in a peer-reviewed journal.Tedros criticized China for not sharing the genetic information earlier, telling a press briefing that “this data could have and should have been shared three years ago.”The samples were collected from surfaces at the Huanan seafood market in early 2020 in Wuhan, where the first human cases of COVID-19 were found in late 2019.Tedros said the genetic sequences were recently uploaded to the world's biggest public virus database by scientists at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.They were then removed, but not before a French biologist spotted the information by chance and shared it with a group of scientists based outside China that's looking into the origins of the coronavirus.The data show that some of the COVID-positive samples collected from a stall known to be involved in the wildlife trade also contained raccoon dog genes, indicating the animals may have been infected by the virus, according to the scientists. Their analysis was first reported in The Atlantic.“There’s a good chance that the animals that deposited that DNA also deposited the virus,"" said Stephen Goldstein, a virologist at the University of Utah who was involved in analyzing the data. “If you were to go and do environmental sampling in the aftermath of a zoonotic spillover event … this is basically exactly what you would expect to find.”The canines, named for their raccoon-like faces, are often bred for their fur and sold for meat in animal markets across China.Ray Yip, an epidemiologist and founding member of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control office in China, said the findings are significant, even though they aren't definitive.“The market environmental sampling data published by China CDC is by far the strongest evidence to support animal origins,” Yip told the AP in an email. He was not connected to the new analysis.WHO's COVID-19 technical lead, Maria Van Kerkhove, cautioned that the analysis did not find the virus within any animal, nor did it find any hard evidence that any animals infected humans.“What this does provide is clues to help us understand what may have happened,” she said. The international group also told WHO they found DNA from other animals as well as raccoon dogs in the samples from the seafood market, she added.The coronavirus’ genetic code is strikingly similar to that of bat coronaviruses, and many scientists suspect COVID-19 jumped into humans either directly from a bat or via an intermediary animal like pangolins, ferrets or racoon dogs.Efforts to determine the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic have been complicated by factors including the massive surge of human infections in the pandemic's first two years and an increasingly bitter political dispute.It took virus experts more than a dozen years to pinpoint the animal origin of SARS, a related virus.Goldstein and his colleagues say their analysis is the first solid indication that there may have been wildlife infected with the coronavirus at the market. But it is also possible that humans brought the virus to the market and infected the raccoon dogs, or that infected humans simply happened to leave traces of the virus near the animals.After scientists in the group contacted the China CDC, they say, the sequences were removed from the global virus database. Researchers are puzzled as to why data on the samples collected over three years ago wasn’t made public sooner. Tedros has pleaded with China to share more of its COVID-19 research data.Gao Fu, the former head of the Chinese CDC and lead author of the Chinese paper, didn’t immediately respond to an Associated Press email requesting comment. But he told Science magazine the sequences are “nothing new. It had been known there was illegal animal dealing and this is why the market was immediately shut down.”Goldstein said his group presented its findings this week to a WHO advisory panel investigating COVID-19’s origins.Michael Imperiale of the University of Michigan, a microbiology and immunology expert who was not involved in the data analysis, said finding a sample with sequences from the virus and a raccoon dog “places the virus and the dog in very close proximity. But it doesn’t necessarily say that the dog was infected with the virus; it just says that they were in the same very small area.”He said the bulk of the scientific evidence at this point supports a natural exposure at the market, and pointed to research published last summer showing the market was likely the early epicenter of the scourge and concluding that the virus spilled from animals into people two separate times. “What’s the chance that there were two different lab leaks?” he asked.Mark Woolhouse, an infectious diseases expert at the University of Edinburgh, said it will be crucial to see how the raccoon dogs' genetic sequences match up to what's known about the historic evolution of the COVID-19 virus. If the dogs are shown to have COVID and those viruses prove to have earlier origins than the ones that infected people, “that’s probably as good evidence as we can expect to get that this was a spillover event in the market.”After a weeks-long visit to China to study the pandemic's origins, WHO released a report in 2021 concluding that COVID-19 most probably jumped into humans from animals, dismissing the possibility of a lab origin as “extremely unlikely.”But the U.N. health agency backtracked the following year, saying “key pieces of data” were still missing. And Tedros has said all hypotheses remain on the table.The China CDC scientists who previously analyzed the Huanan market samples published a paper as a preprint in February suggesting that humans brought the virus to the market, not animals, implying that the virus originated elsewhere. Their paper didn't mention that animal genes were found in the samples that tested positive.In February, the Wall Street Journal reported that the U.S. Department of Energy had assessed “with low confidence” that the virus had leaked from a lab. But others in the U.S. intelligence community disagree, believing it more likely it first came from animals.Experts say the true origin of the pandemic may not be known for many years — if ever.___Cheng reported from London.

                                   Automotive Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) Sensors Market
Market Dynamics:










Light Detection and Ranging sensors (LiDAR), are light detection and ranging systems that use pulsed laser light to illuminate objects. The system uses light to measure the reflected optical pulse of the object. Depending on wavelengths and the laser return time, it calculates the distance to the target object. It then displays a digital representation of the distance onscreen. This is known as Time of Flight. The industry is highly R&D-intensive and LiDAR sensors function on cutting-edge technology.
This market has seen rapid growth due to the rising demand from OEMs for applications in self-driving vehicles and Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems. The market for automotive light detection and range (LiDAR), sensors is growing due to the technological superiority of LiDAR compared to other sensors in the automotive sector such as RADAR, cameras, and the increasing popularity of semi-autonomous cars. There are also stringent regulations regarding vehicle safety and efforts by car makers to adopt LiDAR to reduce fatalities, particularly during night driving. The market’s growth could be impeded by the high price of technology and low sales volumes.
Different levels of LiDAR will be required depending on the level of automation. As less data is needed, low-level automation will require a single LiDAR to integrate. Multiple LiDARs will also be needed as automation levels rise. LiDAR levels 3-4 are in high demand. LiDAR levels 2 and 5 are still in development.

Antidiabetic Sulphonylureas Market
Market Dynamics:










Antidiabetic Sulphonylureas are a class of medications used to treat type 2 diabetes. They work by stimulating the pancreas to produce more insulin, which helps lower blood sugar levels. The market is expected to grow in the coming years due to the increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes worldwide.
The report cites factors such as the increasing prevalence of diabetes, the rising geriatric population, and growing awareness about diabetes treatment as key drivers of market growth.
Market growth can be attributed to increasing diabetes prevalence, increased awareness, and technological advances in antidiabetic drug research. T2DM is most commonly treated with the first generation of sulphonylureas. These include glibenclamide (glibenclamide), gliclazide (glimepiride), and tolbutamide. Glyburide, glipizide, and other sulphonylureas of the second generation are more potent than those of the first. Repaglinide, nateglinide, and other third-generation sulphonylureas make the drugs even more potent. Because of their high utilization rates in treating patients with T2DM, hospitals account for the largest market share.
North America is expected to dominate the antidiabetic sulphonylureas market, followed by Europe and Asia-Pacific. The report notes that the North American market is driven by factors such as a well-established healthcare infrastructure, high adoption of advanced diabetes treatment options, and increasing government initiatives to promote diabetes awareness.
The market is expected to continue to grow in the coming years as the prevalence of diabetes increases and new and improved treatments become available.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839077,Burundi officials detect polio outbreak linked to vaccine,"LONDON (AP) — Health officials in Burundi have declared an outbreak of polio linked to the vaccine, the first time the paralytic disease has been detected in the East African country for more than three decades.Polio has been diagnosed in an unvaccinated four-year-old child in the western part of the country and in two other children who were contacts of the child, authorities in Burundi confirmed in a statement on Friday. Officials also found traces of the virus in sewage samples, confirming the circulation of polio.The virus that sickened the children was found to be a mutated strain of polio that initially came from an oral vaccine.The Burundi government declared the polio outbreak to be a national public health emergency and plans to start an immunization campaign within weeks, aimed at protecting all children up to age seven.“We are supporting the national efforts to ramp up polio vaccination to ensure no child is missed and faces polio's debilitating impact,” said Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, WHO's Africa director.WHO said that the last time children in Burundi were vaccinated against polio was in 2016, but it did not have statistics on how many were reached. The agency said it considered the country's immunity against polio to be “very low.”The epidemic is another setback for the global effort to wipe out polio led by the World Health Organization and partners, which first began in 1988 and initially aimed to eradicate the disease in a dozen years.Polio is a highly infectious disease mostly spread through water and typically strikes children under five. There is no treatment. Although the oral vaccine used in the global effort to eradicate the disease is highly effective, it requires four doses.The oral vaccine can also cause polio in about two to four children per 2 million doses. In extremely rare cases, the weakened virus can also sometimes mutate into a more dangerous form and spark outbreaks, especially in places with poor sanitation and low vaccination levels.In recent years, the oral polio vaccine has caused far more cases of polio than the wild polio virus. Last year, cases linked to the oral vaccine turned up in rich countries including Britain, Israel and the U.S. for the first time in years.Officials began rolling out a new oral polio vaccine last year that they hoped would be less likely to mutate into a version able to trigger new outbreaks. But the epidemic in Burundi — in addition to six cases in Congo — were found to have been sparked by the new oral vaccine.Across Africa, more than 400 cases of polio last year were linked to the oral vaccine, including Congo, Nigeria, Ethiopia and Zambia.The disease also remains stubbornly entrenched in Pakistan and Afghanistan, where transmission has never been stopped.",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839078,Man who hoped to kill Arab and Black people gets 20 years,"ATLANTA (AP) — A Georgia man who shot at two convenience stores hoping to kill Arab and Black people has been sentenced to serve 20 years in prison after pleading guilty to a federal hate crime charge.Larry Edward Foxworth, 48, fired a Glock pistol multiple times through the windows and doors of two convenience stores in Jonesboro, just south of Atlanta, shortly before 3 a.m. on July 30, 2021, the U.S. attorney's office in Atlanta said in a news release. Both stores were open and people were inside, but no one was hit.Clayton County police arrested Foxworth shortly after the shots were fired. He told investigators he wanted to kill Arab and Black people and believed that's who was inside those two stores, the release says. He said he hoped he had killed people and expressed belief in white supremacy.“He fired repeatedly into convenience stores in his effort to kill those inside based solely on the color of their skin,"" U.S. Attorney Ryan Buchanan said in the release. “This abhorrent act of violence and intimidation left the victims, their families, and the community traumatized, and merits the prison sentence Foxworth received.”Foxworth was sentenced Thursday after pleading guilty in December to a charge of a hate crime based on actual or perceived race or color and a charge of discharging a firearm during the commission of that crime of violence.The judge sentenced him to serve five years of supervised release after his prison term and also ordered him to pay $1,000 in restitution.",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839079,EPA tells states not to block waste from Ohio derailment,"The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Friday ordered states to stop blocking contaminated waste from a fiery train derailment in Ohio from being sent to hazardous waste storage sites around the nation.A handful of politicians and states have sought to block shipments from East Palestine, including Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, who last week said he had stopped waste from the derailment from coming into his state.EPA Administrator Michael Regan said there was no reason for states to block shipments of the type of waste that certified facilities routinely handle every day.“This is impermissible and this is unacceptable,” he said.In a letter sent to all states, the EPA said that blocking the shipments would likely violate a federal law dealing with the interstate transport of waste as well as the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which the agency said limits the power of states to stop the movement of hazardous waste.Although it's not clear what steps the EPA might take if states don't cooperate, the agency told railroad Norfolk Southern on Friday that it expects the company to take legal action if it is unable to ship the waste to certified disposal facilities.The EPA already ordered Norfolk Southern to cover the costs of cleaning up from the Feb. 3 derailment that toppled 38 rail cars. No one was hurt, but concerns over a potential explosion led state and local officials to approve releasing and burning toxic vinyl chloride from five tanker cars and forced the evacuations of half the village.Ohio this week filed a lawsuit against Norfolk Southern to make sure it pays for the cleanup and environmental and economic damage along with groundwater and soil monitoring in the years ahead.Norfolk Southern has said it is committed to cleaning up the site and helping the community recover.Many residents remain worried about what they might have been exposed to and how it will affect the area in the years ahead. Government officials say tests over the past month haven’t found dangerous levels of chemicals in the air or water in the area.The cleanup should be completed in about three months, Regan said on Friday.So far, crews have removed nearly 5,500 tons of contaminated soil and 7 million gallons of wastewater from the area, according to the EPA.Three weeks ago, the agency briefly stopped contaminated waste from being removed from the area when concerns were raised about oversight of where it was being shipped to sites in Michigan and Texas. Hazardous waste sites in Ohio and Indiana also have received shipments in recent weeks.",2023/3/18,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839081,"Near 'cliff's edge,' Credit Suisse not seen as systemic risk","GENEVA (AP) — Longtime troubles at Credit Suisse came to a head this week with a record stock plunge that spread fears of a banking crisis jumping from the U.S. to Europe. But the problems have been building for years at Switzerland’s second-largest bank, ranging from bad bets on hedge funds to a spying scandal involving rival lender UBS.Experts say the upheaval is largely a byproduct of Credit Suisse's troubles in recent years — making it look relatively vulnerable — and investor worries about the health of Western banks in general following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in the United States.Shares of Credit Suisse sank over 30% Wednesday after its biggest shareholder — the Saudi National Bank — announced it would not provide more money to the Swiss lender. Hours later, Switzerland's central bank agreed to lend Credit Suisse up to 50 billion francs ($54 billion) to shore up its finances. The stock rebounded.On Friday, shares dropped as much as 12% on the Swiss exchange, trading around 1.86 francs ($1.94) at midday. The stock has seen a long downward slide: It traded at more than 80 francs in 2007.Eswar Prasad, a Cornell University economist, said Credit Suisse has become ""an important bellwether of fragilities in the global banking system” and if it failed, it could dampen confidence in the banking system and spur further central bank intervention.“The Swiss National Bank has in effect pulled Credit Suisse back from the cliff’s edge and is likely to have done enough to stabilize the situation with the massive liquidity infusion,’’ said Prasad, who studies the global financial system. “The wild card is whether steps taken so far by the Federal Reserve and Swiss National Bank will contain the conflagration or if it spreads further, which could engender significant additional turmoil.""The Saudi bank's chairman acknowledged surprise at the fallout from his comments but said he was “optimistic” that Credit Suisse would ""go back to being what it is"" — a bank with a storied legacy dating back more than a century and a half.""I think the markets are very skittish, and they are looking for stories or things that validate concern,"" Saudi National Bank Chairman Ammar al-Khudairy told CNBC on Thursday.He called Credit Suisse's private wealth management, domestic Swiss banking and asset management divisions “stable, long-term consistent businesses” and that the Swiss bank was “working on shedding the other, more-volatile business.”In the wake of reforms enacted after the 2008 financial crisis, Credit Suisse is among the 30 financial institutions known as globally systemically important banks, which have stricter scrutiny and higher capital requirements.Credit Suisse was founded as “Schweizerische Kreditanstalt” in 1856 by industrialist Alfred Escher to finance the development of Switzerland’s complex rail network cutting through the Alps.At the time, it was a high-risk, loss-making industry. Historians say a penchant for risk and innovation permeates through the corporate culture even today.By 1977, Credit Suisse was at the center of a banking scandal known as the “Chiasso Affair,” which led the bank to lose nearly 1.4 billion francs in illegal dealings by a branch in Italian-speaking Switzerland with fugitive funds from Italy.The “internationalization” of Credit Suisse — focusing more on the United States and adopting an “Anglo-Saxon"" culture — led to “identity problems” starting in the 1980s, when it began rising from a midsized European bank into a global player, Tobias Straumann, an economic historian at the University of Zurich, said in the Neue Zuericher Zeitung newspaper Friday.“(Swiss bankers) simply couldn’t cope with this American investment bank culture, with its focus on risk and high profits,” he said. “The combination of Anglo-Saxon investment banking and Swiss asset management did not work in the long run.""The “end of banking secrecy” in Switzerland — which long helped guarantee large financial reserves for Credit Suisse — in recent years has had an important effect by denting its wealth management business, he added.Other Western countries pressured Switzerland to tighten its laws to prevent wealthy tax cheats and others from hiding their money in Swiss banks.More recently, the issues at Credit Suisse have been mostly about poor corporate governance, questionable staffing decisions and excessively risky investments.In 2020, CEO Tidjane Thiam resigned after an external investigation found the bank's chief operating officer had ordered an operation to spy on several former executives, including former wealth management chief Iqbal Khan, who had joined Zurich rival UBS.Two years later, his replacement — longtime Credit Suisse veteran Thomas Gottstein — resigned after the bank posted a quarterly loss of 1.6 billion francs.Credit Suisse even found itself in Swiss court, getting fined last June for failing to prevent money laundering by a Bulgarian crime ring 15 years earlier. The case partly involved an unidentified wrestler accused of trafficking tons of cocaine through “mules” from South America to Europe and laundering the profits.The bank last fall announced settlements worth hundreds of millions of dollars with authorities in the U.S. over mortgage-backed securities that were behind the 2008 financial crisis and in France over a tax fraud case.Credit Suisse is “in trouble because it’s been in trouble for a really long time. It has a whole host of other challenges that everyone’s focusing on now because of bank wobbles in the U.S.,” said Megan Greene, chief economist at the Kroll Institute.That's different than Silicon Valley Bank, which was hit by rising interest rates. The Swiss lender is “full of high-quality assets” but faced a liquidity crisis, and the “playbook” for dealing with that is central bank intervention, she said.“This is not 2008 all over again,’’ Greene said. “But the overreactions that we’ve seen in the market have been eerily reminiscent of 2008. That has gotten everybody’s Spidey-sense tingling.""She said she was worried, ""but rationally speaking, there isn’t a reason to think that a banking crisis is inevitable. It’s just that markets aren’t always rational.""___Wiseman reported from Washington. AP reporter Frank Jordans in Berlin contributed to this report.",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839082,NOT REAL NEWS: A look at what didn't happen this week,"A roundup of some of the most popular but completely untrue stories and visuals of the week. None of these are legit, even though they were shared widely on social media. The Associated Press checked them out. Here are the facts:___Extreme weather events are becoming more severe, not lessCLAIM: Climate, weather or meteorological events that we would classify as “extreme” have declined in severity over the last 20 or 30 years.THE FACTS: While the impacts of climate change vary across the globe, scientists agree that overall, human-caused warming is supercharging events such as extreme precipitation, droughts and forest fires. But a podcast clip shared on Instagram falsely claims that extreme climate, weather and meteorological events are actually declining in severity. “We could look at accumulated cyclonic energy — typhoons in the Pacific, hurricanes in the Atlantic — and it’s actually declined over the last 20 or 30 years,” the speaker says in the video, which amassed thousands of likes. “We could look at forest fires, they’ve declined. We could look at droughts. By any measure that we care to look at, we can see that actually things have kind of calmed down a bit.” Scientists who study climate patterns say these kinds of extremes are aggravated by climate change — and are becoming more severe, not less. “Heat extremes are getting more frequent, more severe; precipitation extremes are getting more frequent, more severe,” said Kai Kornhuber, a lecturer and research scientist at Columbia University. “Fire weather, which is linked to wildfires, is getting more frequent, more severe, more areas that didn’t see these conditions before.” Kornhuber and other scientists reached by the AP pointed to rigorous studies and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association data that show how many types of extreme weather and disasters, including those noted in the podcast clip, have become more intense as a result of climate change. For example, climate change has created warmer and drier conditions in the western United States, leading to fire seasons that last longer and burn more area in recent decades, according to NOAA. Droughts are complicated because “there are big regional and temporal variations,” according to Andrew Dessler, the director of the Texas Center for Climate Studies and a professor at Texas A&M University. “But you cannot say things are ‘calming down.’” A study published earlier this month used satellite data to show that the intensity of extreme drought and rainfall has “sharply” increased across the globe over the past 20 years. The researchers said the data confirms that both the frequency and intensity of rainfall and droughts are increasing due to burning fossil fuels and other human activity that releases greenhouse gases. The AP has previously debunked false claims that U.S. hurricane landfall data disproves climate change. Studies show the intensity of tropical cyclones has been increasing globally. The clip also ignores “some of the most certain ways climate change makes extreme weather more extreme,” including increasing the chances of heat waves, extreme precipitation, and extreme sea level events, according to Dessler. A United Nations climate report published in 2022 also cited evidence that climate change is making it more likely for humans to die from extreme weather. Today’s children who may still be alive in the year 2100 will experience four times more climate extremes than they do now, even with just a few more tenths of a degree of warming, the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said in the report.— Associated Press writer Ali Swenson in New York contributed this report.___Radiation found in humans isn’t lethal, despite claimsCLAIM: 100 million humans in the same place would emit enough radiation to be deadly.THE FACTS: Radiation experts confirm the human body contains trace amounts of radiation, but the levels aren’t nearly enough to be lethal, even if 100 million people were somehow packed into a single place. Social media users are sharing a post with the headline “Humans are Radioactive” along with the statement: “If 100 million average humans kept in an isolated place for eight hours, they will admit enough radiation to kill each one of them within 20 days.” While it’s true that humans, like other living organisms, contain radioactive material, the levels are “extremely low” — thousands of times smaller than an x-ray, according to Melissa Sullivan, a spokesperson for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The radiation also can’t be easily transmitted to others, experts say. To reach a dangerous level, the radiation would somehow have to be gathered from millions of people and then distilled into an extremely confined space. “If you concentrated the radioactive material from many millions of people into a very small space, the result could be a radioactive source that would need to be handled with care to avoid being dangerous,” Christopher Clement, CEO of the International Commission on Radiological Protection, a Canada-based group of scientists that advocates for radiation safety, wrote in an email. “But not as harmful as squeezing a hundred million people into a phone booth.” The social media claims also show a misunderstanding of the kind of radiation found in our bodies, said George Chabot, a physics professor at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell. Human radiation largely comes from eating foods that contain potassium — a tiny fraction of which is radioactive potassium-40, he explained in an email. “What may confuse people is that most of the dose to an individual from eating potassium-40 comes from the beta radiation emitted during the decay of the radioactive atoms,” Chabot wrote. “This beta radiation is not very penetrating so that practically all of the energy emitted remains within the individual and cannot irradiate anyone else.” Michael Short, a nuclear science professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, agreed, arguing that the radiation produced by 100 million people still wouldn’t be deadly, despite what social media users claim. “100,000,000 people would take up a tremendous amount of space, spreading out their radiation dose over that space. The dose one gets from being near a source of radiation decreases quickly with distance away from that dose.” What’s more, the human body acts as a sort of buffer, absorbing much of its own radiation and mitigating its wider impacts, added Christopher Baird, a physics professor at West Texas A&M University. “If one human absorbs a bit of ionizing radiation, then this bit of radiation is no longer available to affect another human,” he wrote in an email. “A hundred million humans will be emitting a hundred-million worth of human background radiation, but there will be a hundred million people absorbing this radiation.”— Associated Press writer Philip Marcelo in New York contributed this report.___Topical fluoride use not proven to cause dementiaCLAIM: Dental products containing fluoride are unsafe because the substance has been directly linked to dementia and Alzheimer’s.THE FACTS: While consuming high levels of fluoride can pose some health risks, experts say there is no research showing that topical products containing fluorides — such as toothpaste and mouthwash — cause dementia or Alzheimer’s. Still, an Instagram user is cautioning against going to dentists because of fluoride, calling dentists “one of the biggest scams I’ve ever seen.” ""They don’t know that fluoride is a neurotoxin that’s been directly linked to dementia and Alzheimer’s,” the user claims in a video. But experts say there is no research proving that topical fluoride products — in other words, products not intended for digestion, such as toothpaste and mouthwash — cause dementia or Alzheimer’s. Christine Till, a neuropsychologist and professor at York University in Canada who has researched fluoride, said she was not aware of studies linking topical fluoride use to those conditions. And the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Division of Oral Health told the AP in a statement that the agency “is not aware of any study that purports to link use of topical fluoride products, when used appropriately, to any systemic health risk.” Fluoride is a naturally occurring mineral that’s found in water and used in toothpaste and dental products to strengthen teeth; it can also be found in foods and beverages. For decades it has been added to many public water supplies as an oral health measure, the CDC explains. But excessive levels of consumption can present health risks such as brittle bones. The U.S. in 2015 lowered the recommended amount of fluoride in drinking water because some kids were getting too much, causing white splotches on their teeth. Fluoride consumption has continued to stir controversy and scientists say there is evidence that consuming fluoride in high levels may pose further risks, particularly for young children. “I’m quite convinced that in utero or infantile exposure to fluoride ingestion is not a good thing for the developing brain of children,” said Linda Birnbaum, a former director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, part of the National Institutes of Health, and of the National Toxicology Program. The National Toxicology Program has been continuing to evaluate the issue. Jennifer Sass, a senior scientist at Natural Resources Defense Council, said the legitimate concerns in the scientific community about fluoride consumption don’t justify avoiding the dentist because of topical fluoride use. The CDC advises that children less than age 2 only use toothpaste with fluoride if recommended by a dentist or doctor.— Associated Press writer Angelo Fichera in New York contributed this report.___Find AP Fact Checks here: https://apnews.com/APFactCheck___Follow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheck",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839083,Pakistani court suspends arrest warrant for ex-PM Imran Khan,"ISLAMABAD (AP) — A top Pakistani court on Friday suspended an arrest warrant for former Prime Minister Imran Khan, giving him a reprieve to travel to Islamabad and face charges in a graft case without being detained.Khan has been holed up at his home in the eastern city of Lahore since Tuesday, after failing to appear at an earlier hearing in the case. His supporters hurled stones and clashed with baton-wielding police for two days to protect the former premier from arrest.Khan, now in the opposition, was ousted in a no-confidence vote in Parliament last April. He is accused of selling state gifts while in office and concealing assets. It's one in a string of cases that the former cricket star turned Islamist politician has been facing since his ouster.He is now due in court on Saturday, after Aamer Farooq, the chief justice at the Islamabad High Court, suspended the warrant in the graft case. The court on Friday also warned Khan that he could face contempt proceedings if he again fails to show up before the judge.The former premier has avoided court appearances since November, when he was wounded in a gun attack at a protest rally in eastern Punjab province. Khan still enjoys a huge grassroots following and has campaigned for early elections.The 70-year-old opposition leader has also claimed that his removal from power was part of a conspiracy by his successor, Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif, and the United States. Both Washington and Sharif’s government have denied the allegations.Friday's suspension of the warrant was welcomed by Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party. “Imran Khan will come to Islamabad to appear before the court,"" said Shibli Faraz, a party leader.After the suspension, a jubilant Khan and an entourage of cheering supporters marched into a top court in Lahore, where the judges granted him reprieves from possible arrest until March 24 in nine other court cases, all on charges of incitement to violence.Tensions have been high in Lahore since Tuesday, when the clashes first erupted outside Khan's residence in the upscale Zaman Park neighborhood. Khan's supporters threw petrol bombs at the officers, who fired tear gas and water cannons.Maryam Sharif, a top leader in Sharif's ruling Pakistan Muslim League party, criticized Khan on Friday for resisting arrest and lauded the security forces for their restraint.“The state can arrest him in five minutes, but it exercised restraint to avoid bloodshed,” she said.",2023/3/17,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839085,Wide receiver Allen Lazard signs 4-year deal with Jets,"Allen Lazard enjoyed everything about New York when he visited for the first time a few months ago.Now, it will be home for the Jets' newest wide receiver. And he'll be reunited with his former offensive coordinator in Nathaniel Hackett— and perhaps soon quarterback Aaron Rodgers.Lazard signed a four-year contract with the Jets on Friday, a deal worth $44 million and includes $22 million guaranteed, according to multiple reports.“For me, I just wanted to get to a big city,” Lazard, who is from Iowa, said during a Zoom call. “I wanted to get to a spot that especially has just a melting pot of culture and just be able to get that experience. You know, the bright lights, New York City.”The Big Apple spotlight might soon shine on Rodgers, Lazard's former Packers teammate, who said on “The Pat McAfee Show” this week that he intends to play for New York this year after 18 seasons in Green Bay. The sides are still working on compensation details to try to complete a trade.Lazard knows expectations will rise enormously if Rodgers lands with the Jets, a franchise that hasn't been to the Super Bowl since 1969 and has the NFL's longest active playoff drought at 12 seasons.""Him being here definitely helps the entire organization be able to take that next step that they need to to make a deep playoff run and go win that Lombardi trophy,” Lazard said.The 27-year-old wide receiver said Rodgers' decision wasn't necessarily a determining factor on where he'd sign as a free agent, but “it definitely helps.”Lazard said coach Robert Saleh's presence also was a factor, but he raved about Hackett, who worked with the receiver in the same role as offensive coordinator in Green Bay from 2019-21.“He’s the best teacher I’ve ever had in my life,” Lazard said. “And I go from school to football, he just makes learning fun. ... He makes it really easy and he allows you to go out there and just play fast and not think. Because of that is why I've had a lot of success these past few years.""Lazard tweeted Thursday night that he and Hackett were at dinner together, hinting the signing was imminent. On Wednesday, he posted on Twitter a farewell to the Packers and their fans: “It’s been an honor to represent the ‘G’ and to rock the green and gold with each and every one of you.”The 6-foot-5 Lazard, regarded as a terrific blocker as a receiver, is coming off his best NFL season. He had personal highs of 60 catches and 788 yards receiving to go along with six touchdowns; in 2021, he had a career-best eight TD receptions.“I think objectively, a lot of people can look at Allen Lazard and go, he’s a really good player, we would love to have him on our team,” Rodgers said on “The Pat McAfee Show."" “Anybody would be lucky to have him in the locker room.”Lazard was signed by Jacksonville as an undrafted free agent out of Iowa State in 2018 and was signed by Green Bay off the Jaguars' practice squad that season.“I still feel undrafted,” Lazard said with a smile, “because the checks haven't hit yet.”After starting just 12 games in his first three seasons, Lazard moved into a starting role and developed a strong rapport with Rodgers while starting 28 games the last two years. In five NFL seasons, Lazard has 169 career receptions for 2,236 yards and 20 TDs.“During my time with Aaron in Green Bay, he really put his arm around me and he's a big reason for why I'm here today,” Lazard said of his NFL career. “I can't deny that. ... He's relied on me in a lot of heavy-pressure situations and always believed in me.”NOTES: P Thomas Morstead posted on Twitter he signed with the Jets, rejoining them after spending part of the 2021 season with New York. The 37-year-old Morstead wrote, “Got my green on. Kiss me, I’m a Jet!” in the post that included a photo of his wife Lauren kissing him while he's wearing his old Jets jersey. Morstead was a free agent after spending last season with Miami. The team hadn't announced the signing of Morstead, who would provide competition for incumbent Braden Mann. ... Former Baltimore G/C Trystan Colon agreed to terms with the Jets after not being tendered by the Ravens as a restricted free agent.

Around the same time, Interior Secretary Deb Haaland held a very different meeting on the same topic.Gathering at Interior headquarters a half-mile (0.8 kilometers) from the White House, leaders of major environmental organizations and Indigenous groups pleaded with Haaland, the first Native American Cabinet member, to use her authority to block the Willow oil project. Environmental groups call the project a “carbon bomb” that would betray pledges made by Biden — and Haaland — to fight climate change and have mounted a social media #StopWillow campaign that has been seen hundreds of millions of times.The closed-door meeting, which was described by two participants who insisted on not being identified because of its confidential nature, grew emotional as participants urged Haaland to oppose a project many believed Biden appeared likely to approve even as it contradicted his agenda to cut planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030.Haaland, who opposed Willow when she served in Congress, choked up as she explained that the Interior Department had to make difficult choices, according to the participants. Many Native groups in Alaska support Willow as a job creator and economic lifeline.Less than two weeks later, the Biden administration announced it was approving Willow, an $8 billion drilling plan by ConocoPhillips on Alaska’s petroleum-rich North Slope.Haaland, who had not publicly commented on Willow in two years as head of the U.S. agency overseeing the project, was not involved in the announcement and did not sign the approval order, leaving that to her deputy, Tommy Beaudreau.In an online video released Monday night, 10 hours after the decision was made public, Haaland said she and Biden, both Democrats, believe the climate crisis ""is the most urgent issue of our lifetime.''She called Willow ""a difficult and complex issue that was inherited'' from previous administrations and noted that ConocoPhillips has long held leases to drill for oil on the site, in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska.“As a result, we have limited decision space,'' she said, adding that officials focused on reducing the project’s footprint and minimizing impacts to people and wildlife. The final approval reflects a substantially smaller project than ConocoPhillips originally proposed and includes a pledge by the Houston-based oil company to relinquish nearly 70,000 acres (28,000 hectares) of leased land that will no longer be developed, she said.The video had received more than 100,000 views by Friday.Haaland declined to be interviewed for this story. But in a statement, the department said Haaland had been “actively involved” in the Willow decision from the start and met with Alaska Natives on both sides of the issue, conservation and other groups and members of Congress.Dallas Goldtooth, a senior strategist for the Indigenous Environmental Network, called it ”problematic"" that Haaland's video was the Biden administration's primary voice on Willow. Biden himself has not spoken publicly on the project.“They use people of color for cover on these decisions,'' said Goldtooth, a member of Mdewakanton Dakota tribe.The White House pushed back on the idea, saying in a statement Friday that as interior secretary, “of course the video came from her.″But Haaland’s body language — at times looking away from the camera — made her appear “very uncomfortable” in the two-minute video, Goldtooth said.Haaland's statement “did not seem to be a wholehearted defense of the decision,'' said Brett Hartl, government affairs director of the Center for Biological Diversity, another environmental group. ""It was almost an apology.''Allowing Haaland to be the administration's public face on Willow strengthens Biden's expected reelection run by allowing him to avoid public scrutiny on an issue on which some of his most ardent supporters disagree with him, environmentalists said.""It's clear-cut D.C. politics,'' Goldtooth said. ""I've seen this play run before,'' including when former Biden environmental justice adviser Cecilia Martinez was put forward to address tribal concerns about two other energy projects, the Dakota Access and Line 3 oil pipelines in the upper Midwest.Asked about Willow on Thursday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters that the oil company “has a legal right to those leases,” adding: “The department’s options are limited when there are legal contracts in place.""Goldtooth and others involved in the Willow fight say the project was largely advanced by Beaudreau, Haaland's deputy, who grew up in Alaska and has a close relationship with the state's two Republican senators. Beaudreau is especially close to Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a former Senate Energy chair who has cooperated with Biden on a range of issues. Murkowski played a key role in Haaland's confirmation, and she and Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia teamed up to get Beaudreau installed as deputy after they objected to Haaland's first choice, Elizabeth Klein.Murkowski told reporters this week that she and other Alaska officials had long realized that the decision on Willow was likely to be made by the White House, despite repeated comments from Jean-Pierre that the decision was up to Interior.The senator, who personally lobbied Biden on Willow for nearly two years, said she reminded him, ""Cooperation goes both ways.''Despite the White House involvement, Haaland has been faulted for the decision to approve Willow. New Mexico’s senior Democratic senator, Martin Heinrich, singled her out for criticism in a rare rebuke of a fellow New Mexico Democrat. Haaland represented the state in Congress before becoming Interior secretary.“The Western Arctic is one of the last great wild landscapes on the planet and as public land it belongs to every American,"" Heinrich said in a statement. ”Industrial development in this unspoiled landscape will not age well.''Rep. Melanie Stansbury, D-N.M., who holds Haaland's former seat in Congress, said she joined millions of people, ""including Indigenous leaders, scientists and lawmakers, in opposing the Willow Project.'' She urged the Biden administration to reconsider the project and its consequences for global climate change.Native American tribes in the Southwestern U.S. have been watching Willow closely, concerned about any implications it could have for development in culturally significant areas, including the Chaco Culture National Historical Park in northwestern New Mexico.A federal appeals court has ruled that the Interior Department failed to consider the cumulative effects of greenhouse gas emissions that would result from the approval of nearly 200 drilling permits near the Chaco site.Haaland, a member of the Laguna Pueblo, visited Chaco in 2021 and told tribal leaders that the Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management would work toward withdrawing hundreds of square miles from development. She also committed to taking a broader look at how federal land across the region can be better managed while taking into account environmental effects and cultural preservation.Mario Atencio, of Diné CARE, a Navajo environmental group, said he understands that the Interior Department faces pressure from GOP lawmakers to increase drilling, as well as conflicting court rulings on a pause ordered by Biden on oil leasing on public land.“We’re very aware that it’s a game of inches sometimes, and there’s a little discretion in some places, and we are just trying to have just as much visibility as the oil and gas industry has,” said Atencio, who is Navajo.The Willow project has divided Alaska Native groups. Supporters call the project balanced and say communities would benefit from taxes generated by Willow. But City of Nuiqsut Mayor Rosemary Ahtuangaruak, whose community of about 525 people is closest to the proposed development, opposes the project and worries about impacts on caribou and her residents’ subsistence lifestyles.Hartl, of the biological diversity group, said Willow was approved by the White House for clear political reasons. “They cared more about Lisa Murkowski's vote than frankly they did the climate,'' he said.___Associated Press writer Susan Montoya Bryan in Albuquerque, N.M., contributed to this story.",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839087,California buildings still in peril from tumbling cliff,"SAN CLEMENTE, Calif. (AP) — About two dozen people forced to flee Southern California apartment buildings endangered by a tumbling oceanside hill may be evacuated indefinitely.Three clifftop apartment buildings and one nearby building in coastal Orange County's San Clemente were red-tagged and evacuated Wednesday when the land began to shift and slide away from their backyards down a hillside following torrential rains.Residents were warned Thursday that they may not be allowed back for a while. Authorities said there was no timetable for declaring the slope stable enough for residents to return.“I think everyone should understand we have a dynamic situation here,” Mayor Chris Duncan said during a news conference. “We have another rainstorm coming, the ground is continuing to move, so these structures are still in peril.”The National Weather Service said heavy rain could hit Southern California again early next week.Twenty to 30 residents were evacuated. Some were briefly allowed back home on Thursday to move out their belongings.Orange County was added to a presidential emergency declaration for areas hard-hit by natural disasters.About 35 out of 58 California counties are now covered by the declaration, which authorizes federal assistance to help state and local governments deal with a series of fierce winter storms.California has been hit with 11 atmospheric rivers in a virtually nonstop series that has sparked floods and landslides, toppled trees, stranded mountain dwellers in historically deep snow and downed power lines, leaving thousands without electricity.Orange County Supervisor Katrina Foley said the county had seen more than $4 million in storm damage, and the figure will escalate.In the city of La Habra, news reports said a sinkhole about 30 foot (9.14 meters) deep opened up Wednesday night next to another sinkhole that opened up in 2019 after heavy rain. Repairs to the earlier hole have yet to be completed.Some Southern California beaches were closed as heavy rain overwhelmed sewage systems and sent thousands of gallons of raw sewage to the sea. Ventura County closed beaches near the Santa Clara River after a collapsed sewer line spewed about 148,000 gallons (560,240 liters) of sewage into the waterway, which flows into the Pacific Ocean. The closures were expected to remain in place through the weekend or until testing shows bacteria levels are safe.",2023/3/17,,World

Tedesco said he traveled to Madrid to explain his decision to Witsel, insisting that the door remains open for him to return.“This is the main message,” Tedesco said. “We just decided for this camp to see some new faces, to see some new young players.""Tedesco last month replaced Roberto Martinez, who led Belgium to a third-place finish at the 2018 World Cup and was in charge of the team for six years. Martinez stepped down after the Red Devils failed to progress to the knockout stage of the 2022 tournament in Qatar.Tedesco's short-term goal is to qualify Belgium for the 2024 European Championship. The Red Devils start their qualifying campaign next week against Sweden. They will then play Germany in a friendly on March 28.Belgium was ranked No. 1 by FIFA for four years during Martinez’s tenure but never won a major tournament. Several members of the “Golden Generation” of Belgian players — Eden Hazard, Toby Alderweireld and Simon Mignolet — announced their retirement from international soccer after the tournament in Qatar.Other experienced players like Michy Batshuayi, Dries Mertens, Youri Tielemans and Thorgan Hazard are out injured and were not available for selection.Tedesco gave a first call-up to Romeo Lavia, a 19-year-old midfielder who has become a regular starter for Southampton in the Premier League.___Belgium:Goalkeepers: Koen Casteels (Wolfsburg), Thibaut Courtois (Real Madrid), Thomas Kaminski (Blackburn), Matz Sels (Strasbourg)Defenders: Sebastiaan Bornauw (Wolfsburg), Timothy Castagne (Leicester), Zeno Debast (Anderlecht), Wout Faes (Leicester), Thomas Meunier (Borussia Dortmund), Alexis Saelemaekers (AC Milan), Arthur Theate (Rennes), Jan Vertonghen (Anderlecht)Midfielders: Kevin De Bruyne (Manchester City), Romeo Lavia (Southampton), Orel Mangala (Nottingham Forest), Amadou Onana (Everton), Dennis Praet (Leicester)Forwards: Yannick Carrasco (Atletico Madrid), Charles De Ketelaere (AC Milan), Jeremy Doku (Rennes), Romelu Lukaku (Inter Milan), Dodi Lukebakio (Hertha Berlin), Lois Openda (Lens), Leandro Trossard (Arsenal)___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839090,Drivers given assurances about safety at Saudi Arabian GP,"Formula One is back in Saudi Arabia this weekend, one year after a missile strike hit an oil depot near the track during race week.And while the drivers expressed confidence in their safety ahead of Sunday's race, seven-time F1 champion Lewis Hamilton again broached the subject of human rights issues in the kingdom.Drivers have been given assurances by F1 that increased safety measures will prevent the race from being impacted like last year, when Houthi rebels from Yemen hit a depot only 11 kilometers (seven miles) away during the first practice session. The attack led to hours of talks between drivers, organizers and stakeholders but the race went ahead.The missile strike came two weeks after 81 people were put to death in Saudi Arabia in a mass execution — the largest in the kingdom’s modern history. According to Reprieve, a non-profit organization defending people facing human rights abuses, a further 16 executions were then carried out.Saudi Arabia is one of several countries accused of ""sportswashing,” using high-profile sporting events to distract from human rights abuses. Others include Bahrain, which held the season-opening F1 race two weeks ago, and Qatar, which hosted soccer’s World Cup last year and also has an F1 race.Drivers were asked about returning to Jeddah given last year's missile strike.“We trust FOM (Formula One Management) and the organization to keep us safe,” French driver Esteban Ocon said. “Obviously, it was scary what happened last year and none of us wants to ever experience something like that.”Aston Martin driver Lance Stroll echoed that, saying he was “confident that Formula One and the organization is going to look after us,” while Red Bull rival Sergio Perez said he trusts “the organizations that bring us here to compete in a safe place.”They spoke Thursday at a scheduled pre-race news conference. But when it came to Hamilton's turn to speak, he said his view was “all the opposite to everything they said.”The Mercedes driver was then asked if he's happy to race in Saudi Arabia.“It’s open to interpretation,” Hamilton said. ""Hopefully everyone has a safe weekend and hopefully everyone gets home safe afterwards.”Pressed again, Hamilton was asked whether he considered not racing in Saudi Arabia because of human rights concerns.“Well, the thing is, if I’m not here, Formula One will continue without me. When I’m going to these different places, I still feel that as a sport go(ing) into places with human rights issues, such as this one, I feel that the sport is duty bound to raise awareness,"" Hamilton said. ""I feel like it needs to do more. What that is, I don’t have all the answers, but I think we always need to try and do more to raise awareness.”The family of Abdullah al-Howaiti, who is facing the death penalty after being arrested in 2017 when he was 14, wrote to Hamilton this week thanking him for speaking about their son during last year's race.“You publicly brought attention to Abdullah’s case, and we are immensely grateful to you for using your for platform to shine a light on the injustice he faces,"" the family wrote in the letter, which Reprieve shared with The Associated Press. ""We cannot put into words how much it meant to our family to know that Abdullah is not forgotten.”CULLEN'S DEPARTUREHamilton parted ways Friday with long-term performance coach Angela Cullen after seven years working together.Hamilton announced the split on his Instagram page.“I am a stronger athlete and a better person because of her,” Hamilton wrote. “Thank you for everything Ang, I can’t wait to see what the future has in store for you.”Just like two weeks ago at the Bahrain GP, Hamilton was cleared by stewards to take part in the two practice sessions on Friday after a jewelry inspection.Hamilton clashed with governing body FIA last year over a jewelry ban and received an exception for his nose stud.VERSTAPPEN AHEADAfter winning the Bahrain GP, two-time defending world champion Max Verstappen topped both practice sessions for Red Bull.The Dutchman, who arrived a day late because of a stomach bug, led P2 from Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso and his Red Bull teammate Sergio Perez under floodlights.Ferrari's Charles Leclerc was ninth and Hamilton 11th.Earlier, Verstappen led P1 from Perez and Alonso — the same 1-2-3 from the Bahrain race — and Alonso's teammate, Lance Stroll, was fourth. George Russell placed fifth for Mercedes ahead of Hamilton.P3 is on Saturday ahead of evening qualifying.FERRARI QUESTIONSFerrari is already fielding questions about the car's reliability after Charles Leclerc retired near the end of the Bahrain GP because of engine failure when he was in third place.Leclerc will start Sunday's race with a 10-place grid penalty after Ferrari used a third electronics control unit on the car’s engine.Last year, engine reliability problems forced Leclerc to retire when leading the Azerbaijan GP and the Spanish GP.Ferrari teammate Carlos Sainz Jr. finished fourth at the Bahrain GP and was 48 seconds behind race winner Max Verstappen's Red Bull car.“We are the first ones that are not happy,” Sainz said. “We’ve faced issues with race pace and reliability that we honestly didn’t expect to face.”Ferrari changed the power units on both cars Friday as a further precaution.Kimi Raikkonen won Ferrari's last drivers’ title in 2007.___More AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839091,Farmworkers use Florida march to pressure other companies,"Farmworkers were leading a five-day, 45-mile (72-kilometer) trek on foot this week from one of the poorest communities in Florida to a mansion-lined, oceanfront town that is one of the richest in an effort to pressure retailers to leverage their purchasing power for better worker pay and working conditions.The farmworkers said they were marching to highlight the Fair Food Program, which has enlisted companies like McDonald’s, Walmart, Taco Bell and Whole Foods to use their clout with growers to ensure better working conditions and wages for farmworkers. They hoped to use the march to pressure other companies, like Publix, Wendy’s and Kroger, to join the program that started in 2011.The march began Tuesday from the farming community of Pahokee, one of the poorest in Florida, where the median household income is around $30,000. The march's launching point was a camp where farmworkers were coerced into working for barely any pay by a labor contractor who was convicted and sentenced last year to almost 10 years in prison. The contractor confiscated the Mexican farmworkers' passports, demanded exorbitant fees from them and threatened them with deportation or false arrest, according to the U.S. Department of Justice.The marchers were on schedule to arrive Saturday in the town of Palm Beach, which has a median household income of almost $169,000 and is lined with the mansions of the rich and famous, including billionaire Nelson Peltz, who is Wendy's chairman, and former President Donald Trump.According to the Florida-based Coalition of Immokalee Workers, which organized the march, the program has ensured that farmworkers are paid for the hours they work; guaranteed them on-the-job safety measures such as shade, water and access to bathrooms; and has reduced the threats of sexual assault, harassment and forced labor under armed guards in the fields where tomatoes and other crops are harvested. Immokalee is a southwest Florida farming town in the heart of the state's tomato-growing area.Growers have benefitted since it reduces turnover and improves productivity, according to the coalition.Wendy's said in a statement that it didn't participate in the Fair Food Program because it sources its tomato supply from indoor hydroponic greenhouse farms, while the program operates for farmworkers predominantly in outdoor fields, so “there is no nexus between the program and our supply chain.” The fast-food chain said it requires third-party reviews to make sure no abuses are involved in the harvesting of the tomatoes it gets from suppliers.“The idea that joining the Fair Food Program, and purchasing field-grown, commodity tomatoes, is the only way that Wendy’s can demonstrate responsibility in our supply chain is not true,” Wendy's said.The coalition on Friday in a statement described Wendy's response as a “dodge.”Officials from Publix and Kroger didn’t respond to emailed inquiries.The idea to pressure retailers to use their clout with growers to improve pay and conditions for Florida tomato pickers took off in the early 2000s when the Coalition of Immokalee Workers led a four-year, nationwide boycott of Taco Bell. The boycott ended in 2005 when the company agreed to pay a penny more per pound for tomatoes purchased from Florida growers in order to raise farmworkers' wages.The Fair Food Program followed several years later in an agreement with Florida tomato growers, and it now includes more than a dozen participating corporations. Leaders of the Coalition of Immokalee Workers and the Fair Food Program have been recognized with a MacArthur Foundation fellowship, a Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights award and presidential award presented by then-Secretary of State John Kerry.“So now workers enjoy the right to complain without fear of retaliation. Workers also have water and shade as part of these agreements,” said Gerardo Reyes Chavez, a coalition official, at the start of the march in Pahokee. “The program has proven to be the solution, the antidote to the problem of modern day slavery, the problem of sexual assault, and the problems that have always plagued the agricultural industry.”___Daniel Kozin in Pahokee, Florida contributed to this report.___Follow Mike Schneider on Twitter at @MikeSchneiderAP",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839092,"After last year's stunning failure, bonds show up for safety","NEW YORK (AP) — Suddenly, bonds are again living up to their reputation as the safe part of an investor’s portfolio.As stocks sank worldwide over the last week on worries about the banking system following the second- and third-largest U.S. bank failures in history, bonds shot up in price. That offered some protection to any investor with a mixed set of stocks and bonds in their portfolio, as most advisers suggest.Through the middle of March, the largest U.S. bond fund, Vanguard's Total Bond Market Index fund, returned 2% while the largest U.S. stock fund lost 2.7%. That may not sound like a big deal, but it’s a marked return to form for bonds.Last year, they were anything but the safe part of a saver’s nest egg. Their prices plunged on fears about the highest inflation in generations and what the Federal Reserve was doing about it.Inflation by itself makes bonds less attractive because it means the fixed payments they make will buy less stuff in the future as prices rise.But the barrage of hikes to interest rates instituted by the Fed in hopes of getting inflation under control also inflicted pain. The Fed has vaulted its key overnight rate to a range of 4.50% to 4.75%, up from virtually zero at the start of last year. That helped pull yields higher across the bond market.When that happens, newly issued bonds making higher interest payments suddenly look much more attractive than the older bonds already sitting in investors' portfolios. That makes prices in the market for those older bonds drop. And bond funds have to record such changes in price.What made things worse for investors was that bond prices fell last year at the same time stocks did. The hope in having a diversified set of investments is that some will rise when others fall, keeping the overall portfolio safer. That didn't happen last year.This month, though, bonds rallied as worries spread about the banking system following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. That helped to buffer anyone who was also invested in stocks or commodities.“These are the safe haven assets that are actually acting like safe havens,” said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial. “You couldn’t say that last year.”Of course, the rally means that bonds are carrying lower yields than just a week ago. That means they'll pay a little bit less in income than before and have a little smaller cushion for future price drops.",2023/3/17,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839154,Belarus gives media outlet Tut.by staff long jail terms,"Senior staff of the Tut.by independent online news site in Belarus received lengthy sentences in a closed-door court in Minsk Friday.Editor-in-chief Marina Zolotova, 45, and the general director Lyudmila Chekina, 54, were jailed for 12 years. They faced charges that ranged from ""incitement to hatred"" to tax evasion, a popular means of targeting opposition figures.Both journalists were detained in 2021 and saw their homes raided along with 13 of their colleagues.The Belarusian Association of Journalists said the verdict was ""cruel revenge for the truth."" Reporters Without Borders called the sentence ""absurd.""Two others who are considered government critics were given 10 year sentences, including political analyst and website editor Valeria Kostyugova.In August 2020, following a contested presidential election, Belarusian strongman Alexander Lukashenko claimed victory and launched a brutal crackdown against his democratic opponents who contested his nearly 30-year reign.Thousands of people were imprisoned for participating in mass protests against Lukashenko's regime, with hundreds alleging torture for which there is evidence in Belarusian jails and prison camps for political opposition.All opposition figures have either been incarcerated or live in exile, such as Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya who stood in for her husband in the contested presidential election in 2020 and later claimed victory.Tsikhanouskaya condemned the verdict against Tut.by leadership, calling it ""another attempt by the regime to kill honest journalism in Belarus.""The crackdown quickly expanded to civil society and media and by mid-2022 Tut.by was labeled an ""extremist organization"" and shut by the Belarusian state authorities.Earlier this month, the international community expressed concern when Nobel Peace Prize winner Ales Bialiatski received a 10-year sentence.Some journalists with Tut.by fled amidst the crackdown to Ukraine and reestablished themselves under the publication title, ""Zerkalo,"" or ""mirror"" if translated from Russsian.Ahead of the draconian jail terms behind handed down, Zerkalo journalists wrote, ""Mila, Marina, we are proud of you. Your integrity and resilience are an example to us all.""They added, ""We will continue your work: telling Belarussian people the real news, no matter what.""ar/msh (AFP, Reuters)",2023/3/17,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839155,ICC issues arrest warrant for President Vladimir Putin,"The International Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin, over responsibility for war crimes committed by Russian forces in Ukraine during the war ongoing for over a year.The international court based in The Hague said that Putin was suspected of responsibility for ""the war crime of unlawful deportation of population (children) and that of unlawful transfer of population (children) from occupied areas of Ukraine to the Russian Federation.""""There are reasonable grounds to believe that Mr Putin bears individual criminal responsibility for the aforementioned crimes, (i) for having committed the acts directly, jointly with others and/or through others ..., and (ii) for his failure to exercise control properly over civilian and military subordinates who committed the acts, or allowed for their commission, and who were under his effective authority and control, pursuant to superior responsibility,"" the ICC wrote in a Friday statement.The court did not elaborate on how it intended to carry out the warrant. Russia tends not to cooperate with international extraditions, is not a full member of the ICC, and does not accept its jurisdiction.The ICC said the warrant was issued based on an application submitted by the prosecution earlier in February.The ICC also issued an arrest warrant for Maria Lvova-Belova, Russia's Presidential Commissioner for Children's Rights, on the same charges Putin was facing.More to follow..rmt/msh (AFP, dpa, AP, Reuters)",2023/3/17,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839156,New film on the bombing of German cities in WWII,"Ukrainian director Sergei Loznitsa's latest film starts innocently enough — people go about their daily lives, stroll through Berlin, peer out the window in a southern German village and watch the goings-on in the village square. There is even a scene where a cow is herded onto a river ferry.Then, 12 minutes into the film, the first bombs fall from thousands of planes, dropped on German cities, including Cologne, Dresden and Berlin.In his new film ""A Natural History of Destruction,"" which celebrated its German premiere in Berlin on March 15 and opens in national cinemas on March 16, Loznitsa focuses on the Allied bombing raids on Nazi Germany.For the movie, he edited archival material from the Second World War era and set it to a score by Dutch composer Christiaan Verbeek — a soundtrack that gives the audience the chills.Loznitsa has been producing documentaries exclusively from archival footage for many years. His goal is to ""get the skeletons out of the closet of history,"" he told DW. His films are about traumas that no one talks about.""If something is not discussed openly and honestly, it becomes a skeleton in the closet that will eventually come back to haunt you,"" says Loznitsa. And that can have serious consequences, the award-winning director adds.""History follows certain laws and tends to repeat itself, in particular if you don't reflect and analyze certain events, don't draw lessons from them; there is a danger that they will repeat themselves,"" he says.Ukrainian director Sergei Loznitsa knows what he is talking about. The 58-year-old has experienced historical upheavals firsthand. He grew up in the former Soviet Union, a totalitarian state, and finally experienced its collapse in the late 1990s. Almost simultaneously, he changed his profession. The trained mathematician became a filmmaker.He is now one of the best-known European documentary filmmakers, and has a unique approach. In his role as director, he sees himself purely as an observer, which means that critics regularly accuse him of lacking discernment. Is it permissible to simply set up one's camera on the grounds of the former Auschwitz concentration camp and film happy groups of tourists as they take selfies there? That's exactly what Loznitsa did for his film ""Austerlitz"" (2016) — it didn't comment on the disturbing scenes.For his film ""Babi Yar. Context"" (2021), Loznitsa combed through German, Russian and Ukrainian archives and assembled a film from the footage that recalls the Babi Yar massacre, which was suppressed and forgotten for decades. In a ravine in Kiev, 33,771 Jewish men, women and children were murdered over two days in September 1941 by German Nazis and Ukrainian auxiliary policemen. The fact that the film also features Ukrainians who greeted the approaching Nazis was met with criticism in his homeland.Loznitsa occasionally makes feature films. Most recently, he devoted ""Donbass"" (2018) to the war that has raged in eastern Ukraine between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian separatists since 2014. Its protagonists have turned away from society, they no longer believe in the government, Fake news is omnipresent. In the wake of the Russian invasion, Loznitsa's work seems frighteningly prescient.That's the reason why he took a closer look at the brutal episodes of European history in ""The Natural History of Destruction.""Some of the footage shown is harrowing. In one shot, corpses are laid out side-by-side on a street in the ruins following a night of bombing. One image shows the body of a toddler dressed in a fine, light-colored dress, staring lifelessly at the sky.Loznitsa says he is used to working with difficult material, and he is careful not to go too far and shock the audience too much. His goal, he says, is that both he and the viewers can create a certain distance from the events shown.""The further away in time you are from what is in the film, the less personal it is, the less emotionally disturbing,"" he says, which makes it possible at times ""to take a step back and understand quite rationally what happened."" That distance can help us learn from the experience, he says.Loznitsa say that he was inspired by an essay by W. G. Sebald, a 20th-century German author. ""I started planning this film back in 2017,"" citing Sebald's ""On the Natural History of Destruction.""

""Sebald had inspired me to make a film before, which was 'Austerlitz,' and I wanted to go on from there.""""Another reason for making the film was that I was already expecting this new war,"" the Ukrainian filmmaker says, referring to the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine. ""I could foresee that. In a way, I was expecting the horror of what's happening right now.""However, he doesn't want his film to be seen only in the context of Russia's war in Ukraine. We already knew that such things were happening, he argues, for instance, in Syria where cities were shelled and the population attacked. ""That may be another reason why I felt the issue was more relevant than ever,"" he says.Loznitsa read extensively before making ""A Natural History of Destruction.""In an interview with DW, he referred to war theorists, including 19th-century General Carl von Clausewitz, a Prussian arch-conservative who held the view that war is the actual normal state of humanity — and peace the exception.""As soon as humans organize themselves into groups, certain patterns seem to emerge,"" Loznitsa says, arguing that the problem is not human nature but a conflict of mentalities.""We think we all live in the same era, but that's a mistake. Some people still live in the Stone Age, some in the Middle Ages, some in the 19th century, others in the 21st century. For some, the most important thing is to conquer territory; for others, individual freedom and intellectual development are the highest good,"" he observes.The problem, he adds, is that these values are really incompatible. ""The conflict arises from the fact that the mentalities cannot be reconciled,"" he says.His film shows the effects such conflicts can have. No one speaks much in ""The Natural History of Destruction."" The war machinery just plods on until the cities depicted are in ruins.

It is ""difficult today to form even a halfway-adequate notion of the extent of the devastation of German cities that took place during the last years of World War II, and even more difficult to reflect on the horror associated with that devastation,"" wrote W.G. Sebald.In recent years, Neo-Nazis in Germany have repeatedly used the bombings to relativize the crimes of the Nazi regime. That is not Loznitsa's intention at all.Nevertheless, the lack of context and the focus on the suffering of the German population poses potential for criticism. Thus, ""an irritatingly skewed view of the war emerges, in which the victims of Nazi terror remain a blank space,"" said cultural journalist Christian Berndt on Deutschlandfunk radio. Film critic Patrick Seyboth also notes that Loznitsa's attitude is ""very consistent, but also worthy of discussion.""In DW's conversation with him it becomes clear that he wants to raise the following questions: What happened during this period, and how do we deal with it today? ""The answer to the first question is relatively simple,"" the director says. ""The second question — what did it actually mean for people — is still a mystery.""This article was originally written in German.",2023/3/17,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839157,Turkey's Erdogan paves way to ratify Finland NATO accession,"President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Friday that Turkey would start the process of ratifying Finland's NATO membership bid in parliament, saying that the country had taken ""sincere and concrete steps"" to allay Turkey's concerns about Finland hosting Kurds and other opposition forces who fled Turkey.The breakthrough came as Finnish President Sauli Niinisto was in Ankara to meet with Erdogan and 10 months after both Finland and Swden applied to become NATO members in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, having remained neutral throughout the Cold War.""We have decided to start the protocol of Finland's accession to NATO in our parliament,"" Erdogan said following talks with his visiting Finnish counterpart Sauli Niinisto.Niinisto welcomed Turkey's plan to start the process of ratifying Finland's NATO membership. ""We understood earlier on that you have done your decision and signing it today confirms that the Turkish parliament starts to work with ratification of Finnish membership,"" Niinisto said.With Erdogan's agreement, Finland's application can now go to the Turkish parliament, where the president's party and its allies hold a majority. Ratification is expected before Turkey holds its presidential and parliamentary elections scheduled for May 14.NATO requires the unanimous approval of the legislatures of its 30 existing members to expand, and Turkey and Hungary are the only two countries yet to do this for Sweden and Finland.Meanwhile, Mate Kocsis, the leader of the ruling Fidesz party's parliamentary group, said that Hungary's legislature will vote on the ratification of Finland's NATO accession on March 27 and the majority ruling party bloc will unanimously support the bid.In a news conference, Erdogan also said Turkey would continue discussions with Sweden on terrorism-related issues and that Sweden's NATO membership bid would depend directly on measures taken.Sweden's NATO membership will depend on their response to Turkish demands, including repatriation of 120 ""terrorists,"" Erdogan said.Turkey's government accuses Sweden of being too soft on groups that it deems to be terror organizations, including Kurdish groups, and has said it has fewer problems with Finland. Two Swedish protests late last year, in particular, prompted Turkey to dig its heels in further. One involved Kurdish activists using an effigy of Erdogan, and another involved far-right protesters burning copies of the Quran.dh/msh (AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters)",2023/3/17,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839158,India: How water crisis is haunting Sundarban residents,"Karuna, 65, ran across the narrow lanes of her village a little before noon, calling out to other women on the streets — ""is the water coming?"" She adjusted an empty metal pitcher against her hip, as she made her way towards a different water pipeline to ask the same question.Karuna and the 200-odd families in her village were waiting for water since 7 a.m. A winding line of plastic cans, buckets and pitchers had formed in front of the government-installed drinking water taps.""It is supposed to come three times a day,"" explained Debasis Sarkar, another resident of Village No. 4, also known as Malpara, in the Gosaba Block of Sundarbans. ""Two hours early in the morning, two in the afternoon and another two in the evening,"" he said. That has not happened in weeks.Sundarbans, partly in the eastern Indian state of West Bengal and partly in Bangladesh, is the world's largest mangrove forest. A delta between the rivers Ganges, Brahmaputra, Meghna and the Bay of Bengal, 30% of the forest is covered in water bodies. Yet, large parts of the region are going through a severe water crisis worsened by climate change and local policies.The pipelines don't work for months at a time and the groundwater in most islands is either far too deep or far too salty. Thousands of families on the delta are now having to buy drinking water. That is especially a problem considering the population is economically weak, with little opportunity to escape their circumstances. ""We can barely afford two meals a day and now we're having to pay for water. This is torture,"" Sarkar said.Sundarbans' mangrove forest has historically protected the inlands from cyclonic storms which originate in the Bay of Bengal. But changing climate patterns have resulted in stronger, more frequent storms while deforestation of the mangroves has weakened its ability to resist them.In 2009, Cyclone Aila — classified as a category 1 storm, the lowest on the scale of five — devastated the region with around 2.3 million people affected, according to Associated Press. Despite its classification as a lower category storm, it led to widespread floods which washed away mud houses, crops and livestock alike in a matter of hours.In recent years, the region has been battered by one severe cyclone after the other — Fani (category 5) and Bulbul (category 3) in 2019 and Amphan (category 5) in 2020.With every storm, the sea's saltwater floods into the land, contaminating the freshwater ponds and wells. In the past, the West Bengal government has commissioned programs to raise the height of tube wells to avoid their submergence, but locals say that has not worked. Yet, several villages continue to consume that water due to lack of alternates.Joy Banerjee, a resident of Delhi who works in the Indian armed forces, now conducts independent trips to Sundarbans when he can, with boats full of drinking water. ""When I started visiting villages away from tourist hotspots, I realized the general water they drink is saline. There are no government pipelines in the faraway coastal islands. They are used to it now,"" he told DW. ""But they have no idea how bad it is for their health.""Drinking water salinity has been found to be associated with cardiovascular diseases, diarrhea and abdominal pain.A 2015 report by the World Bank on the ""poor"" situation of drinking water in Sundarbans stated that an estimated 1,925 deaths and over 1.5 million cases of diarrhea were reported in the region in 2008. Things have only worsened since, according to the global financial institution. A follow up report by the World Bank in 2020 warned, ""This situation will likely have numerous adverse effects on mother-child health, including dehydration, hypertension, prenatal complications, and increased infant mortality.""Located a 10-minute drive away from the village is a pond-based water filtration plant that supplies pipeline water to Malpara and a few other villages, including Arampur, Chondimon and Borobari. Set up in 2018 by the West Bengal government, the plant takes dirty water from four large ponds and filters out 300 million gallons of water for every 20 minutes of operation.However, operating the plant has become difficult. ""Today is the last day we're operating the plant this season,"" said Debashish Adhikari, one of the five caretakers of the plant. ""There isn't enough water left in the ponds to operate the machinery. Whatever water is left in the system will be filtered on loop to keep the machinery in good condition for the next few months till monsoon hits,"" he told DW.Adhikari blames the water shortage on the Block Development Office's policies which leases out the same ponds to a few families with large agriculture fields or fisheries. ""They are local affluent families with political connections, that's why they've gotten the lease,"" he said. ""This should not be happening.""Adhikari and local villagers said that the larger ponds are leased out for a period of 1-2 years at a time for hundreds of thousands of rupees even though villagers depend on the same water. He alleged that the lease had been given to influential names in local village-level politics.Pressure from villagers has pushed the current village chief, locally known as the ""pradhan,"" to take the matter to the block development officer (BDO), but little has changed.DW asked Joint Block Development Officer Bidhan Mridha about the nature of the lease, why the same ponds that are being used to provide drinking water, were also being used for other purposes, and how the funds raised from the lease were being used. ""The ponds are leased only for the purpose of fisheries,"" he said.""The said lease is given by Gosaba Panchayat Samiti and the fund is treated as the own fund of Gosaba Panchayat Samiti. Respected BDO/EO of panchayat Samiti on behalf of the Panchayat Samiti utilizes the fund in varied development purposes.""A Panchayat Samiti is a layer of government in rural India which acts as a link between the village council and the district authorities. Its members consist of block development officers, and members of the state's legislative assembly and parliament belonging to that area.Achin Paik, head of Sundarbans Panchayat Samiti, did not respond to DW's phone calls.Gosaba Block's Pradhan Gurupado Mandal confirmed that the ponds had been leased out to 2-5 men with influence, without providing further details. Meanwhile, villagers in the Gosaba block remain without access to clean and free drinking water.Pakhirala, a village in Gosaba at the edge of the river towards the deep forest, has an additional issue to deal with. The village's proximity to the river and annual floods clogs the soil with salt, making the land unfit for cultivation.""Once salty water goes into the soil, nothing grows on it. We have to wait for the whole year and more rain to decontaminate the soil,"" said Shubho Mondol, a resident there. He goes on to describe an endless cycle of rain, which clears the soil, followed by cyclone season, which destroys whatever crops have grown in the past few months.Communities in several villages like Parikhala, Khapukur and Hasnabad have given up on agriculture and switched to catching prawns and crabs from small estuaries.Sundarbans' water crisis is not new. Several investigations, global studies and reports have outlined the dangers of climate change for the region. Despite the warnings, things have only gotten worse.West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, in a recent trip to the region, acknowledged the problem and promised action, according to local reports. ""I've heard about your water-related problems. We are trying to solve it. We will connect all households in West Bengal with tap water by 2024,"" she said, according to The Telegraph.Banerjee further said the state government was working on a masterplan for the overall development of Sundarbans, which includes declaring the region as a separate district.India's Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, in her 2023-24 national budget, announced a new initiative for mangrove plantations along the coastline and on saltpan lands. MISHTI or the 'Mangrove Initiative for Shoreline Habitats & Tangible Incomes' was announced after India joined the Mangrove Alliance for Climate, launched during the 27th Conference of Parties (COP27) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in late 2022.Experts have hailed it as a good and necessary step towards long-term conservation of coastlines and the rich biodiversity mangroves sustain. However, the efforts are likely to take time to show results.Edited by: Srinivas Mazumdaru",2023/3/17,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839160,India: How electric vehicles are driving a green transition,"Last year, electric vehicle (EV) sales in India reached a million units, a significant leap of over 300% from the around 320,000 units sold over the previous year, according to the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways.While a third of EVs sold were electric three-wheelers, EVs accounted for 4.7% of overall automobile sales of the nearly 3.7 million passenger vehicles in 2022. The country has over 1.88 million registered EVs.With a surging car market, India's transition to electric mobility will be faster as automobile companies make big-ticket investments in the development of infrastructure to facilitate electric vehicle penetration in the country, industry experts expect.""I am bullish about the EV market. Given the right impetus, rising EV adoption will create an immediate requirement to embrace the next-generation needs of the automotive industry,"" Jaideep Wadhwa, director of Sterling Gtake E-Mobility, a motor control units' manufacturer for EVs, told DW.India is the third-largest automobile market globally in terms of sales, even ahead of major markets like Germany and Japan. Given the encouraging signs, there is now a push for manufacturers and policymakers to work together to shift demand towards greener options.The Economic Survey 2023, an annual document of the Finance Ministry, predicts that India's domestic electric vehicle market will see a 49% compound annual growth rate between 2022 and 2030, with 10 million annual sales by 2030.Additionally, the electric vehicle industry is projected to create around 50 million direct and indirect jobs in the next seven years.Another independent study by the Centre for Energy Finance (CEEW-CEF) showed that the EV market in India will be a $206 billion (€194 billion) opportunity by the end of this decade if it maintains steady progress to meet its ambitious 2030 target.This would require a cumulative investment of over $180 billion in vehicle production and charging infrastructure.In 2021, the Indian EV industry attracted $6 billion in investment and is becoming steadily more attractive to private equity and venture capital investors.""This is a positive sign that the market is picking up, especially in the two and three-wheeler segments where the cost of ownership and cost parity with the internal combustion engines have improved considerably,"" Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director at Center for Science and Environment, told DW.Chowdhury pointed out that the ongoing federal government incentive program and state-level policies have contributed to this trend and have also helped to build the electric bus program for zero emissions urban commuting.At the COP26 summit in Glasgow, India pledged to achieve net-zero emissions status by 2070 and to lower its emission intensity by 45% from 2005 levels by 2030. EVs could help realize these goals and play a pivotal role in India's green transition.In Glasgow, India rolled out its website e-AMRIT, which functions as a one-stop destination for all information on EVs and addresses concerns about the adoption of EVs and their purchase — such as charging facility locations and EV financing options as well as information about investment opportunities, government policies, and available subsidies for drivers and manufacturers.Currently, the transport sector accounts for 18% of total energy consumption in India, which translates to an estimated 94 million tons of oil-equivalent (MTOE) energy.The Bureau of Energy Efficiency estimates that, if India were to follow the current trends of energy consumption, it would require an estimated 200 MTOE of energy supply annually by 2030 to meet demand.""With supportive government policies, increasing consumer awareness, and improvements in technology, we will transition towards a more sustainable and eco-friendly mode of transportation,"" a senior government official told DW, requesting anonymity.Indian conglomerates such as Reliance, Adani, and Tata are similarly investing in electric vehicles and green hydrogen.They are beginning to invest huge money consequently in clean technology sectors such as electric vehicle charging infrastructure, biofuels, renewables, carbon capture and storage, and green hydrogen.But the road to a fully-electric ecosystem still has a distance to traverse with high costs, inadequate infrastructure, and lack of high performing EVs, cited as reasons.Hoping to convert more consumers into EV owners, the government is offering subsidies for its purchase, and a tax exemption of 150,000 Indian Rupees (€1,708, $1,818) is also given for people buying electric cars on loan.During the stage of ""faster adoption and manufacturing of hybrid and electric vehicles"" (FAME), the government has been trying to improve the infrastructure for electric vehicle manufacturing in the country.There are more than 65,000 gas stations in the country but only 1,640 EV charging stations. Petroleum companies are expected to come up with a plan for 22,000 EV charging stations by 2024. In comparison, China has approximately 900,000.Moreover, a battery swapping policy has been put forward as an easier way to charge EVs. Last year, the government also announced a production-linked incentive scheme for automakers, a part of which aims to boost electric vehicle manufacturing.""A lot of things are possible. Every street lamp can also be turned into a charging station with the swipe of a credit card. But what is good to know is that many states have introduced policies that have led to the increased adoption of EVs,"" Wadhwa said.However, the change in the electric car segment compared to two- and three-wheelers, is slower, as costs are still high.According to NITI Aayog, an Indian public policy think tank, by 2030, 80% of two- and three-wheelers, 40% of buses and 30%-70% of cars in India will be EVs.While it is encouraging to see the market picking up, Chowdhury stressed a lot more is needed to meet NITI Aayog's recommended aspirational target.""This will require immediate intervention to define the next stage of the current incentive program, which is coming to an end in 2024, and a regulatory target with zero emissions vehicle mandate to accelerate the electric mobility transition,"" Chowdhury said.Edited by: Alex Berry",2023/3/17,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839161,"St. Patrick's Day rites: Parades, bagpipes, clinking pints","Oh, Danny boy, 'tis the time of year when Irish bagpipes are calling in the concrete glens of New York City, across the swooning boughs of Savannah, Georgia, and in the halls of the White House as the U.S. celebrates St. Patrick's Day with parades, pub crawls and a state visit.Thousands of tourists and locals alike crowded the oak-shaded squares and downtown sidewalks of Savannah on Friday. The city's parade, a 199-year-old tradition, is the South's largest.Veteran parade watchers arrived before dawn to claim space in the squares for picnic tables and party tents. Bars opened at 7 a.m. to greet customers already thirsty for beer and Bloody Marys.The annual parade in New York City — which bills itself as the world's largest and oldest — drew throngs to Fifth Avenue to await bagpipes and bands, and give homage to Ireland's patron saint.“When we march up Fifth Avenue,"" New York Mayor Eric Adams said during the annual St. Patrick’s Day Breakfast Reception, ""it appears as though everything turns to green.”Irish immigrants have a deep history in helping New York City become what it is today — one of the many groups, the mayor said, “that make up our city and that makes us great.”Kevin Conway, the parade’s grand marshal, led the way.“We’re going to march in a celebration of all things Irish, the Irish culture, the Irish people. We’re going to march in tribute to the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Peace Agreement,” he said, referring to the peace accord that helped end sectarian violence over the reunification of Ireland and Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom.Bernadette Byrne, who took in the parade while visiting from Ireland, felt right at home.“The atmosphere is great,” she said. “Everybody’s so friendly.”In Portland, Oregon, the city's oldest Irish bar was in hot pursuit of a Guinness — not the famed Irish beer but what they hope will be a world record for the biggest Irish coffee ever brewed: 264 gallons of it.Some cities, including Boston, will hold parades and other festivities this weekend. Other cities including Chicago, which dyes its river green to commemorate a day when everyone pretends to be Irish, already held their parades last weekend.On Friday, the fountain on the South Lawn of the White House also flowed green as President Joe Biden, who often speaks of his Irish heritage, welcomed Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar. The COVID-19 pandemic had delayed the longstanding meetup by two years. Biden said he plans to visit both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland this year, where he will likely commemorate the U.S.-brokered peace agreement.Also in the nation’s capital, Cardinal Wilton Gregory, the first Black cardinal from the United States, greeted the faithful with handshakes, hugs, and a few selfies amid the tunes of bagpipes and movements of Irish dancers.In Savannah, temperatures were springlike, in the mid-70s (24 C). Fittingly, many parade watchers wore shorts with green T-shirts and strands of green plastic beads.Mike Trout painted his entire face and bald head with green makeup, accented by an orange plastic mustache.“You got the spirit, brother!” said one passerby, tapping Trout on the shoulder as he and wife, Diana, strolled the streets before the parade. The couple from Camp Hill, Pennsylvania, traveled to Savannah just to celebrate St. Patrick’s.Started in 1824 by Irish immigrants to Georgia’s oldest city, the St. Patrick’s Day parade in Savannah has ballooned into one of the South’s largest street parties after Mardi Gras.“This is a lot of people,” said Sheila Barry, a Savannah native who staked out spots with a friend along Abercorn Street near the start of the parade route. They packed sandwiches, water and something else to drink that Barry described mischievously as “St. Patrick’s holy water.”Barry, 55, wore a wide felt sash of emerald green embroidered with the names of her late parents, Irish immigrants who came to Savannah more than five decades ago.“Everybody, they’re all Irish today,” Barry said. “Everybody’s just here to have a good time.”Vivian Penn’s 2-year-old granddaughter, Adeline, clapped and waved as Savannah’s parade kicked off with school children in kilts carrying American and Irish flags followed by the droning whine of a bagpipe band. The girl in a white dress with shamrocks and green stripes celebrated her birthday just two days before St. Patrick’s Day.“She’s always going to be an Irish redhead,” Penn said of her blond grandchild.Friday marked just the second parade in Savannah since the coronavirus pandemic forced city officials to pause the celebration in 2020 and 2021. Even last year’s comeback parade seemed subdued, with plenty of elbow room along the typically packed parade route, said Penn, who lives nearby in Savannah’s downtown historic district.“This looks like it’s back to normal,” Penn said. “This morning I was like, ‘Yes, it’s St. Patrick’s Day!’ Seeing all the people out the window with their chairs running down the street was very exciting.”___This story corrects the number of years the Savannah parade as been a tradition to 199, instead of 100.___Bynum reported from Savannah, Georgia, and Calvan from New York.

(AP) — Derek Chauvin, the ex-Minneapolis police officer serving time for George Floyd's murder, pleads guilty to tax evasion.",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839163,"Chauvin, who killed George Floyd, pleads guilty in tax case","MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The former Minneapolis police officer convicted in the 2020 killing of George Floyd pleaded guilty Friday to two tax evasion counts, admitting that he didn't file Minnesota income taxes for two years due to “financial concerns.”Derek Chauvin pleaded guilty specifically to two counts of aiding and abetting, failing to file tax returns to the state of Minnesota for the 2016 and 2017 tax years.Chauvin appeared in a Minnesota court via Zoom from a federal prison in Tucson, Arizona, where he is serving his sentences on a state murder conviction for killing Floyd and on a federal count of violating Floyd's civil rights.He stood in a room and paced around before Friday's hearing began. When Washington County Judge Sheridan Hawley asked why he didn't file his Minnesota tax returns, he told the judge: “The true reason is some financial concerns at the time.”He also said: “I had to find significant funds from family to pay a previous year’s return and, frankly, I’ve been playing catch up ever since.”He was sentenced to 13 months in prison on the tax charges, but he has already been incarcerated for longer than that and was given credit for time served.Floyd died May 25, 2020, after Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee against the Black man’s neck for more than nine minutes. Floyd, who was handcuffed, repeatedly said he couldn’t breathe. The killing, which was recorded on video by a bystander, sparked worldwide protests as part of a broader reckoning over racial injustice.Shortly after Floyd’s killing, Chauvin and his then-wife were charged with multiple counts for allegedly underreporting their income to the state of Minnesota and failing to file Minnesota tax returns. The complaints alleged that from 2014 to 2019, the Chauvins underreported their joint income by $464,433.With unpaid taxes, interest and fees, the Chauvins, who have since divorced, owe $37,868 to the state, according to court documents.The tax investigation began in June 2020, after the Minnesota Department of Revenue received information about suspicious filings by Derek Chauvin. The agency started an internal cursory review and then opened a formal investigation.The probe ultimately found the Chauvins did not file state tax returns for 2016, 2017 or 2018, and did not report all of their income for 2014 and 2015. When tax returns for 2016 through 2019 were filed in June 2020, the Chauvins did not report all of their income in those years either, the complaints said.The complaints said Chauvin was required to pay taxes on income from off-duty security work he did at several jobs between 2014 and 2020. Investigators believe that at one job he earned about $95,920 over those six years that was not reported.His ex-wife, Kellie May Chauvin, pleaded guilty Feb. 24 to two counts of aiding and abetting their failure to file tax returns for 2016 and 2017. Her plea agreement called for three years of probation and restitution with no more than 45 days of community service. The other charges were dropped. Hawley said she will be sentenced May 12.Kellie Chauvin filed for divorce shortly after Floyd’s death, and a judge approved the divorce last February under terms that were kept sealed. The judge rejected an initial proposed settlement that would have given Kellie Chauvin most of their property and money, which had fueled speculation that the Chauvins were trying to shield their assets.Documents in the tax case said the couple owned a second home in Florida, and alleged they also failed to pay proper sales tax on a $100,000 BMW purchased in Minnesota in 2018.Chauvin was convicted of state murder and manslaughter charges in 2021 and is serving 22 1/2 years in that case. He also pleaded guilty to a federal charge of violating Floyd’s civil rights and was sentenced to 21 years. He is serving the sentences concurrently.Three other officers were convicted of federal charges of violating Floyd’s rights. Two of them have also been convicted of a state count of aiding and abetting manslaughter, while the third is waiting for a judge to decide his fate on the state charges.___Trisha Ahmed is a corps member for the Associated Press/ Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

He added that the increase is the biggest in 20 years.The announcement came just days after the government increased teachers’ wages following a nearly weeklong protest that disrupted public schools.Jamaica’s economy was hit by the pandemic, the war in Ukraine and a drop in tourism, but it has since recovered substantially, according to a February report by the International Monetary Fund.Annual inflation in Jamaica ranged as high as 11% over the past two fiscal years but is projected to decline to about 5% in the coming fiscal year starting next month, the report said.",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839167,International court issues war crimes warrant for Putin,"THE HAGUE (AP) — The International Criminal Court said Friday that it has issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin for war crimes, accusing him of personal responsibility for the abductions of children from Ukraine.It was the first time the global court has issued a warrant against a leader of one of the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council.The ICC said in a statement that Putin “is allegedly responsible for the war crime of unlawful deportation of (children) and that of unlawful transfer of (children) from occupied areas of Ukraine to the Russian Federation.”The move was immediately dismissed by Moscow — and welcomed by Ukraine as a major breakthrough.Its practical implications, however, could be limited as the chances of Putin facing trial at the ICC are highly unlikely because Moscow does not recognize the court’s jurisdiction or extradite its nationals.But the moral condemnation will likely stain the Russian leader for the rest of his life — and in the more immediate future whenever he seeks to attend an international summit in a nation bound to arrest him.""So Putin might go to China, Syria, Iran, his ... few allies, but he just won’t travel to the rest of the world and won’t travel to ICC member states who he believes would ... arrest him,” said Adil Ahmad Haque, an expert in international law and armed conflict at Rutgers University.Others agreed. “Vladimir Putin will forever be marked as a pariah globally. He has lost all his political credibility around the world. Any world leader who stands by him will be shamed as well,” David Crane, a former international prosecutor, told The Associated Press.The court also issued a warrant for the arrest of Maria Lvova-Belova, the commissioner for Children’s Rights in the Office of the President of the Russian Federation. The AP reported on her involvement in the abduction of Ukrainian orphans in October, in the first investigation to follow the process all the way to Russia, relying on dozens of interviews and documents.ICC President Piotr Hofmanski said in a video statement that while the ICC’s judges have issued the warrants, it will be up to the international community to enforce them. The court has no police force of its own to do so.The ICC can impose a maximum sentence of life imprisonment “when justified by the extreme gravity of the crime,” according to its founding treaty, the Rome Statute, that established it as a permanent court of last resort to prosecute political leaders and other key perpetrators of the world’s worst atrocities — war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide.Still, the chances of Putin or Lvova-Belova facing trial remain extremely remote, as Moscow does not recognize the court’s jurisdiction — a position it vehemently reaffirmed Friday.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia doesn’t recognize the ICC and considers its decisions “legally void.” He called the court’s move “outrageous and unacceptable.”Peskov refused to comment when asked if Putin would avoid making trips to countries where he could be arrested on the ICC’s warrant.Ukraine’s human rights chief, Dmytro Lubinets, has said that based on data from the country's National Information Bureau, 16,226 children were deported. Ukraine has managed to bring back 308 children.Lvova-Belova, who was also implicated in the warrants, reacted with dripping sarcasm. ""It is great that the international community has appreciated the work to help the children of our country, that we do not leave them in war zones, that we take them out, we create good conditions for them, that we surround them with loving, caring people,” she said.Ukrainian officials were jubilant at the move.In his nightly address to the nation, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called it a “historic decision, from which historic responsibility will begin.""Sergiy Kyslytsya, Ukraine’s U.N. ambassador, recalled that on the night of Russia’s invasion, “I said at the Security Council meeting that there is no purgatory for war criminals, they go straight to hell. Today, I would like to say that those of them who will remain alive after the military defeat of Russia will have to make a stop in The Hague on their way to hell.”In Washington, President Joe Biden called the ICC's decision “justified,” telling reporters as he left the White House for his Delaware home that Putin “clearly committed war crimes.” While the US does not recognize the court either, Biden said it “makes a very strong point” to call out the Russian leader's actions in ordering the invasion.Olga Lopatkina, a Ukrainian mother who struggled for months to reclaim her foster children who were deported to an institution run by Russian loyalists, welcomed news of the arrest warrant. “Everyone must be punished for their crimes,” she said in a message exchange with the AP.While Ukraine is also not a member of the global court, it has granted it jurisdiction over its territory and ICC prosecutor Karim Khan has visited four times since opening an investigation a year ago.Besides Russia and Ukraine, the United States and China are not members of the 123-member ICC.The ICC said its pre-trial chamber found “reasonable grounds” that Putin ""bears individual criminal responsibility” for the child abductions “for having committed the acts directly, jointly with others and/or through others"" and for failing to “exercise control properly over civilian and military subordinates who committed the acts.”During a visit this month, ICC prosecutor Khan said he went to a care home for children 2 kilometers (just over a mile) from front lines in southern Ukraine.“The drawings pinned on the wall ... spoke to a context of love and support that was once there,"" he said in a statement. ""But this home was empty, a result of alleged deportation of children from Ukraine to the Russian Federation or their unlawful transfer to other parts of the temporarily occupied territories.”“As I noted to the United Nations Security Council last September, these alleged acts are being investigated by my office as a priority. Children cannot be treated as the spoils of war,” Khan said.And while Russia rejected the allegations and warrants, others said the ICC action will have an important impact.“The ICC has made Putin a wanted man and taken its first step to end the impunity that has emboldened perpetrators in Russia’s war against Ukraine for far too long,"" said Balkees Jarrah, associate international justice director at Human Rights Watch. ""The warrants send a clear message that giving orders to commit, or tolerating, serious crimes against civilians may lead to a prison cell in The Hague.”Crane, who indicted Liberian President Charles Taylor 20 years ago for crimes in Sierra Leone, said dictators and tyrants around the world ""are now on notice that those who commit international crimes will be held accountable.”Taylor was eventually detained and put on trial at a special court in the Netherlands. He was convicted and sentenced to 50 years' imprisonment.On Thursday, a U.N.-backed inquiry cited Russian attacks against civilians in Ukraine, including systematic torture and killing in occupied regions, among potential issues that amount to war crimes and possibly crimes against humanity.The sweeping investigation also found crimes committed against Ukrainians on Russian territory, including deported Ukrainian children who were prevented from reuniting with their families, a “filtration” system aimed at singling out Ukrainians for detention, and torture and inhumane detention conditions.On Friday, the ICC put the face of Putin on the child abduction allegations.___Casert reported from Brussels.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839168,Ten Hag: Several factors behind Rashford's hot scoring form,"MANCHESTER, England (AP) — With Marcus Rashford on the brink of a 30-goal season for the first time in his career, Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag allowed himself a moment of satisfaction.“I think I said it in the summer. The question came several times if I believe Rashford or (Anthony) Martial, one of them could score 20 plus goals and I said yes,” the Dutchman recalled on Friday.Ten Hag is not the first United manager to put his faith in Rashford discovering his scoring touch.The England striker has had hot streaks under Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, but his inconsistency raised questions over his ability to be a goal scorer of the highest level.That was until this season.His winner against Real Betis in the Europa League on Thursday was his 27th goal of a career-best season that is getting better by the week.His previous best was in 2019-20 when he scored 22 goals. Last season he managed just five in the entire campaign, a run that saw him dropped from the England squad, and raised doubts about his United future.Rashford has been transformed under Ten Hag, who appointed former Blackburn forward Benni McCarthy as United's striker coach last summer.Ten Hag has also given Rashford a consistent role in his favored position on the left of attack after years of being moved around by previous managers.Then there is the more attacking brand of football played by the former Ajax coach, which has already seen United win a first trophy in six years in the League Cup, while the team is still in contention for the FA Cup and Europa League.“I think the most important (thing) is the way of playing. That gives him a base, gives him a structure, the way of play is in his favor because I knew his skills,"" Ten Hag said at a news conference ahead of United's FA Cup quarterfinal against Fulham on Sunday. “Then you also need staff around who can make it better and make it progress. I thought we needed one on the staff who is specific and responsible for strikers. Benni is doing a good job.”Ten Hag added: ""It’s a total package, and it’s not about one person.”Rashford is certainly flourishing under his new manager.He has now scored 19 goals in his last 24 matches since returning from the World Cup in December.To put that in context, Manchester City striker Erling Haaland has scored 16 in his last 18 games, including five against RB Leipzig in the Champions League on Tuesday.Ten Hag believes Rashford's record could have been even better.""He progressed during the season, he was also not in the best shape when he started the season,” he said.___James Robson is at https://twitter.com/jamesalanrobson___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839169,"Jim Gordon, rock drummer who killed mother, dies at 77","LOS ANGELES (AP) — Jim Gordon, the rock ‘n’ roll session drummer who played on classic records by Eric Clapton, George Harrison and The Beach Boys but suffered from growing mental health problems and spent the second half of his life in prison for killing his mother, has died at 77.Gordon died Monday at the California Medical Facility in Vacaville, the state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation confirmed Thursday. It's believed he died of natural causes, but the official cause will be determined by the Solano County coroner. Gordon, who was diagnosed with schizophrenia, had been in prison for four decades.From the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s, few drummers were more in demand than Gordon, a Los Angeles native and protege of the all-time versatile session man, Hal Blaine. Gordon had been drumming since his teens and — early in his career — was part of Phil Spector's celebrated studio ensemble, “The Wrecking Crew,"" which featured Blaine.“When I didn’t have the time, I recommended Jim,” Blaine told Rolling Stone in 1985. “He was one hell of a drummer. I thought he was one of the real comers.”Gordon eventually played on the Beach Boys' landmark, experimental “Pet Sounds” and the Byrds' “The Notorious Byrd Brothers,"" Harrison's post-Beatles triple album “All Things Must Pass” and Steely Dan's jazz-rock “Pretzel Logic.” He worked with a wide range of top acts, from Joan Baez and Jackson Browne to Merle Haggard and Tom Petty. One of his notable credits was a drum break on the Incredible Bongo Band’s “Apache” that has been frequently sampled by rap music artists, among them Jay-Z, Busta Rhymes and Kool Moe Dee.Gordon also toured with with Clapton, bassist Carl Radle and keyboardist Bobby Whitlock: the core of what, in 1970, became Derek and the Dominos, one of rock's greatest one-shot groups.Their only studio album, the double record “Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs,” has often been called the creative peak of Clapton's career. He was tormented at the time by his unrequited love for Harrison's wife, Pattie Boyd, and channeled his despair into such anguished blues and hard rock jams as “Why Does Love Have To Be So Sad?"", “Bell Bottom Blues” and the seven-minute title track.The first half of “Layla” was a high-volume showcase for Clapton and guest guitarist Duane Allman, the second half a mournful piano coda of disputed origins. Gordon was officially credited as co-writer for “Layla,” but Whitlock later claimed Gordon took the piano melody from his then-girlfriend, singer Rita Coolidge. In her 2016 memoir “Delta Lady,” Coolidge wrote that the song was called “Time” when she and Gordon wrote it. They later played it for Clapton, who — Coolidge alleged — used it for “Layla.”“I was infuriated,” Coolidge wrote. “What they’d clearly done was take the song Jim and I had written, jettisoned the lyrics, and tacked it on to the end of Eric’s song. It was almost the same arrangement.”By the early 1970s, Gordon was already becoming a danger to others. Coolidge wrote in her memoir that the couple was touring with Joe Cocker when Gordon attacked her one night in a hotel hallway. Gordon hit her in the eye, she wrote, “so hard that I was lifted off the floor and slammed against the wall on the other side of the hallway.” She was briefly knocked unconscious.With two weeks left on the tour, Coolidge performed with a black eye. She didn’t file battery charges against Gordon but did sign a restraining order, and their relationship ended.In June 1983, Gordon attacked his 71-year-old mother, Osa Gordon, with a hammer and fatally stabbed her with a butcher knife. He claimed that a voice told him to do it.It wasn't until after his arrest for second-degree murder that Gordon was diagnosed with schizophrenia. Gordon was sentenced to 16 years to life in prison with the possibility of parole. However, he was denied parole several times after not attending any of the hearings and remained in prison until his death.___AP National Writer Hillel Italie contributed reporting from New York.",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839170,Review: Yves Tumor’s album thrills from start to finish,"“Praise A Lord Who Chews But Which Does Not Consume; (Or Simply, Hot Between Worlds)” by Yves Tumor (Warp Records)Yves Tumor’s new album starts with a scream. The first song, “God is a Circle,” quickly layers in heavy breathing and a propulsive beat. Tumor never lets up — the artist’s fifth studio album is a thriller from start to finish.The title, like the album itself, is grandiose and a bit inscrutable: “Praise A Lord Who Chews But Which Does Not Consume; (Or Simply, Hot Between Worlds)” delivers a unique blend of electronica, glam, goth and new wave.Like many artists, Tumor partly reinvented during COVID and spent the period designing and upholstering furniture. The earlier albums were experiments in densely curated noise, mixing industrial, droning and found sounds. The post-pandemic work has not abandoned these roots but instead builds irresistible hooks on top of the more abstract soundscapes to strike an effective balance between experimentation and accessibility.Still, this is heavy music throughout. As with Nine Inch Nails and Joy Division, Tumor offers just enough pop sensibility to pull it toward the mainstream.The bass playing is warm and organic, lending buoyancy on otherwise cool tracks. And although vocals sometimes feel like an afterthought, on songs such as “Meteora Blues” Tumor sings with a grinning brightness evocative of Tricky and Lenny Kravitz.The instrumental track “Purified by Fire” opens with a cinematic, '70s-style instrumental that fully deconstructs and then rebuilds to an apocalyptic clamor. Tumor has a mastery of mood palates that could lead to a second career in Hollywood scores.___For more AP Music reviews, visit: https://apnews.com/hub/music-reviews",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839171,Syrian Kurdish force says it lost 9 fighters in Iraq crash,"QAMISHLI, Syria (AP) — The main U.S.-backed and Kurdish-led force in northeastern Syria said Friday it lost nine fighters, including a commander, when two helicopters crashed this week in neighboring Iraq.The group known as Syrian Democratic Forces said the helicopters crashed during bad weather while en route to the northern Iraqi city of Suleimaniyah on Wednesday night. The nine killed included elite fighters, the group said.The statement added that the Syrian Kurdish fighters were in Iraq as part of an “exchange of expertise” in the fight against the militant Islamic state group. It identified the killed commander as Sherfan Kobani, a cousin of SDF's top commander, Mazloum Abdi.The SDF did not elaborate on the cause of the crash or provide further details. The group called on local authorities in Iraq to hand over the nine bodies so they could be brought home for burial in Syria.The SDF has been a main force in the fight against the militant Islamic State group in Syria and still carries out operations against the extremists. IS once controlled large parts of Syria and Iraq under the extremists’ so-called caliphate and still has sleeper cells in the region. The militants frequently stage attacks, targeting Kurdish-led fighters in Syria, and also Iraqi forces and civilians in Iraq.The SDF statement is in sharp contrast to a report on Thursday from Iraqi Kurdish authorities, which said that only one helicopter — an AS350 Eurocopter — had crashed in Iraq’s Dohuk province in the northern semi-autonomous Iraqi Kurdish region.That report said that at least five people, including insurgents of Turkey’s outlawed Kurdistan Worker’s Party, or PKK, were on board. Zagros Hiwa, a PKK spokesperson, said Thursday the group does not possess helicopters and that the PKK was also investigating the crash.The PKK has been waging an insurgency against Turkey since the 1980s and is considered a terrorist group by Ankara, the United States and the European Union. Its militants have established safe havens in northern Iraq and frequently come under attack by Turkey in the region.Iraq’s government, the U.S-led coalition and Turkey had all denied ownership of the helicopter.",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839172,Women's March Madness finds foothold on national TV,"With hopes of a separate television contract in upcoming negotiations, the women's NCAA Tournament keeps gaining momentum.The national title game returns to network television for the first time since 1995, with an ABC broadcast on April 2 from Dallas and a one-hour pregame show.ABC will feature at least six games from the women's tournament, including two first-round games Saturday and a pair of second-round contests Sunday.“Putting it on ABC, we're giving it the best opportunity for success,” said Dan Ochs, who handles women's basketball programming for ESPN. “This tournament continues to grow and deliver for us.”South Carolina’s 64-49 victory over Connecticut in last year's title game averaged 4.85 million viewers on ESPN — the most-watched women’s championship game since 2004. It was also the fourth-largest audience for the title game since the network began airing the entire tournament in 1996.The 2022 women's tournament overall averaged 634,000 viewers per game, a 16% increase over 2021, with many of the rounds seeing their highest averages in more than 10 years.ESPN has every reason to believe those numbers can increase: Regular-season games on the network averaged over 190,000 viewers, making it the most-viewed regular season since 2015. And a matchup of two undefeated teams on Feb. 12, in which South Carolina topped LSU, was the most-watched regular-season women's game since 2010 with an average of 1.47 million viewers.Advertising for the tournament has sold out for the second straight year, ESPN said, with 15 broadcast sponsors and nearly 100 advertisers.It's the third year that all of the women's NCAA Tournament games will have national air time between ABC, ESPN, ESPN2, ESPNU and ESPNews. The staggered start times and multiple channels brings it in line with the men's tournament in terms of access.Up until 2019, ESPN used regional windows during the first two rounds, with the games mostly on ESPN or ESPN2.ESPN's current contract to broadcast the women's tournament expires next year. Right now, the women's tournament is part of a package with 28 other title events and does not include the men's tournament. ESPN pays $34 million per year for the championships package, which it agreed to in 2011.The NCAA is expected to decide by the fall if the women's tournament will become a separate entity, along with how the other championships may be divided.“I mean, all of the things and the investments that have been made from the NCAA over the last few years are really important, and greatly recognized and appreciated,” UCLA coach Cori Close said. “That being said, I’m also really excited for a few that still need to be attacked. And I think that, really being able to separate and go to market as the new ESPN contract comes up to bid, I think that’s an important next step as well as meaningful unit distribution as associated with the women’s tournament.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/18,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839175,Ann Summers lingerie chain boss Jacqueline Gold dies at 62,"LONDON (AP) — Jacqueline Gold, who helped make lingerie and sex toys a female-friendly mainstream business as head of Britain's Ann Summers chain, has died, her family said Friday.She was 62 and had been diagnosed with breast cancer seven years ago. Gold’s family said she died on Thursday with close family by her side.Gold’s father, David Gold, bought the four struggling Ann Summers sex shops in the early 1970s. Jacqueline joined as an intern several years later, rising to become director, then chief executive and finally executive chairwoman.She ditched the firm's forbidding men-only atmosphere and made them more appealing to women, with female-friendly products sold both in shops and through women-only, at-home gatherings inspired by Tupperware parties.Under her, Ann Summers became a familiar feature of the British high street, with more than 80 stores nationwide.She told the BBC radio show “Desert Island Discs” in 2018 that it was “a real culture change” for the business.“Female empowerment has always been at the heart of everything we do,” she said.The family statement said Gold’s “vision and creativity” turned Ann Summers “from an unknown brand to a British household name.”“Jacqueline is best-known for founding Ann Summers and leading a business run by women, for women. She was also an activist for women in business, and championed female entrepreneurs with the ambition to better the working environment for women,” the family said.Gold was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II in 2016 for services to entrepreneurship, women in business and social enterprise.Sister Vanessa Gold, who is now chief executive of Ann Summers, said “Jacqueline courageously battled stage four breast cancer for seven years and was an absolute warrior throughout her cancer journey.”“In life she was a trailblazer, a visionary, and the most incredible woman, all of which makes this news that much harder to bear. As a family, we are utterly heartbroken at the loss of our wife, mum, sister, and best friend.”Gold died two months after her father, who was co-chairman of Premier League soccer team West Ham United.She is survived by her husband Dan Cunningham and daughter Scarlett, as well as her sister.",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839176,UK officer guilty of misconduct for clubbing ex-soccer star,"TELFORD, England (AP) — A British police officer was allowed to keep her job Friday after a disciplinary panel found her guilty of gross misconduct for unlawfully clubbing former professional soccer player Dalian Atkinson, who died after another officer used a stun gun and kicked him in the head.An independent police disciplinary tribunal gave constable Mary Ellen Bettley-Smith a written warning after finding she unlawfully struck the Black former Aston Villa striker three times with her baton after he was subdued by her partner during an altercation in August 2016.The West Mercia officer could have been stripped of her badge by the panel that was convened after she was acquitted at a criminal trial of causing bodily harm.Bettley-Smith's conduct was “indeed serious” but she was on the periphery of the event and her partner's role was ""several stages of magnitude different,” prosecutor Dijen Basu said at the hearing.Constable Benjamin Monk was sentenced to eight years in prison for manslaughter in the killing of Atkinson.Monk claimed self-defense and said he feared for his life after Atkinson made threats and smashed a glass door pane.Monk used a Taser on Atkinson for 33 seconds — more than six times longer than was standard — and kicked him at least twice in the head, leaving bootlace marks on his forehead.Police had been called to the Telford home of Atkinson's father in central England after neighbors reported disturbances.The panel found Bettley-Smith, 33, initially used her baton lawfully to strike Atkinson three times. But the blows after he had been kicked by Monk and was on the ground were “unnecessary, disproportionate and unreasonable in all the circumstances and were therefore unlawful.""Bettley-Smith claimed she perceived Atkinson was trying to get up, though witnesses said he wasn't moving.Atkinson, 48, died about an hour later in a hospital.Attorney Patrick Gibbs, who represented Bettley-Smith, said that the 6 1/2 years she's had to reflect on that night “must be a significant punishment in itself.” Her conduct before and after the 27 seconds when she delivered the final three blows had been admirable, he said.“This involves a miscalculation in the heat of moment in the degree of force which still now needed to be used,” Gibbs said.The West Mercia police chief apologized to Atkinson's family, saying she was deeply sorry.“A police uniform does not grant officers immunity to behave unlawfully or to abuse their powers,” chief Pippa Mills wrote.Monk's conviction was a rarity in Britain. A lawyer for Atkinson's family said it was the first time in over 30 years that a serving officer was convicted on a manslaughter charge in connection with their duties.",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839177,Biden calls for tougher penalties for execs of failed banks,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden on Friday called on Congress to allow regulators to impose tougher penalties on the executives of failed banks, including clawing back compensation and making it easier to bar them from working in the industry.Biden wants the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to be able to force the return of compensation paid to executives at a broader range of banks should they fail, and to lower the threshold for the regulator to impose fines and bar executives from working at another bank.He called on Congress to grant the FDIC those powers after the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank sent shockwaves through the global banking industry.“Strengthening accountability is an important deterrent to prevent mismanagement in the future,” Biden said in a statement. “Congress must act to impose tougher penalties for senior bank executives whose mismanagement contributed to their institutions failing.”Currently the FDIC can only take back the compensation of executives at the largest banks in the nation, and other penalties on executives require “recklessness” or acting with “willful or continuing disregard"" for their bank's health. Biden wants Congress to allow the regulator to impose penalties for “negligent” executives — a lower legal threshold.Congress has already begun to address the aftermath of the bank failures.On Friday, the House Financial Services Committee's top Democrat, Rep. Maxine Waters of California, said in a letter to regulators that while she is crafting legislation to give regulators more authority, “it is critical that your agencies act now to investigate these bank failures and use the available enforcement tools you have to hold executives fully accountable for any wrongful activity.”The Justice Department, Security and Exchange Commission, Federal Reserve, the California state regulator of Silicon Valley Bank and several congressional committees have announced some form of investigation into the bank failure.Additionally, a group of Senate Democrats on Thursday introduced the Deliver Executive Profits on Seized Institutions to Taxpayers Act, which would claw back profits made by bank executives on the sale of stocks and compensation bonuses earned within 60 days of a bank failure, among other things.And Sens. Jack Reed (D-R.I.) and Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) reintroduced legislation this week to strengthen the SEC's ability to crack down on violations of securities laws.The White House highlighted reports that Silicon Valley Bank CEO Gregory Becker sold $3 million worth of shares in the bank in the days before its collapse, saying Biden wants the FDIC to have the authority to go after that compensation.The shuttering of Silicon Valley Bank on March 10 and of New York’s Signature Bank two days later has revived bad memories of the financial crisis that plunged the United States into the Great Recession about 15 years ago.Over the weekend the federal government, determined to restore public confidence in the banking system, moved to protect all of the banks’ deposits, even those that exceeded the FDIC’s $250,000 limit per individual account.Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, who chairs the Banking Committee, welcomed Biden's call for congressional action, stating in an email that his committee ""will be looking at all the ways we can protect working families’ money from risky bets that didn’t pay off in Silicon Valley or on Wall Street.""That includes holding accountable the executives who ran this bank into the ground and the regulators tasked with overseeing them, and it includes working to reform our laws to better protect workers, small businesses, and taxpayers from corporate greed.”John Core, an accounting professor who specializes in executive compensation and corporate governance, questioned whether increasing the authority of regulators was the right move, since “in the case of Silicon Valley, it’s not yet even clear who is to blame” for the bank's collapse.“So many people think it was a regulatory failure, or it was because of rapid increases in interest rates due to inflation,” he said.Dennis Kelleher, president of Better Markets, a nonprofit that advocates for tougher financial regulations, said the White House was right to encourage Congress to act.“Regulators simply must have a full arsenal to severely punish faithless, irresponsible and reckless bank executives, officers and directors,” Kelleher said.",2023/3/18,,World

All four face multiple charges and were jailed Friday in neighboring Washington County.Iron County has about 9,500 residents and sits 100 miles (161 kilometers) southwest of St. Louis.Burkett's lawyer, Gabe Crocker, said the charges are politically motivated.“This is small-town politics,” Crocker said. ""This is the continuation of a long gestating effort to remove this sheriff from office.""Charging documents say that in February, Gaston, 62, sought to take his daughter after an argument with the child's mother. Among the accusations against Burkett: Prosecutors say he lied to a 911 dispatcher to report that the mother had kidnapped the girl, and falsely accused the woman of putting the child in danger. Ultimately, the girl remained with her mother.The sheriff and deputies also are accused of tracking the woman's whereabouts through her cell phone.All four men were charged with criminal street gang activity since the alleged crime was organized. Burkett, 46, also is charged with attempted kidnapping, being an accessory to stalking, and other crimes.Gaston's alleged crimes include stalking and attempted parental kidnapping. Gaston, Cozad and Bresnahan do not yet have attorneys, according to Missouri's online court reporting system.Burkett is jailed on $500,000 cash-only bond.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839192,Librarian fired for 'unkind pushback' at conservative event,"HENDERSONVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — A library director in Tennessee has been fired after the actor and evangelist Kirk Cameron accused him of “unkind pushback” to visiting celebrities during a conservative event last month, officials said.Sumner County Mayor John Isbell told The Tennessean that the county's library board voted 4-3 on Wednesday to fire Hendersonville library director Allan Morales. The mayor said Morales' termination was “related to the Kirk Cameron event.”Photos of the Feb. 25 event posted by Cameron on Facebook show him reading a children's book to a room full of dozens of kids and adults. He wrote that the event involved “praying and teaching faith in God and moral values to our kids,” as well as the national anthem and the Pledge of Allegiance.Also in attendance were Missy Robertson of the reality TV show “Duck Dynasty” and former University of Kentucky women’s swimmer Riley Gaines.In a video obtained by the Tennessean, Gaines can be seen recording a video near what appears to be the library's front desk. As she speaks about transgender athletes, loud noises can be heard off-camera, which she believed were excessive and intentional.Gaines, a resident of Sumner County, told the newspaper she also recalled Cameron felt Morales was speaking too loudly during filming, but she didn't know if the noise was intentional.In his social media post, Cameron described “unkind pushback (from one disgruntled librarian).”Emails obtained by the Tennessean indicated Morales was concerned about the event's size.“Our invitation was sincere to read a book during our story time,” Morales wrote to a representative from Brave Books, which helped put on the event.“We guard that time because it is for small children and not adults. We work hard at not promoting any agendas left or right,” Morales wrote in an email dated Feb. 22.Morales declined to comment about the episode to the newspaper.“I don’t want to add to all this. I’m hoping, now that they have fired me, that the community can move on. There’s not much of a point to giving my side. At end of the day I don’t hate anybody,” Morales said.",2023/3/18,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839195,Judge orders more Trump lawyer testimony in Mar-a-Lago probe,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal prosecutors investigating the potential mishandling of classified documents at former President Donald Trump's Florida estate will be able to again question a Trump lawyer before a grand jury, a judge has ruled in a sealed order.The order will require M. Evan Corcoran to answer additional questions as prosecutors pursue their investigation into classified documents found at Mar-a-Lago as well as potential efforts to obstruct that probe. The order was described Friday by a person familiar with it, who was not authorized to discuss a sealed proceeding and spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity.The precise scope of the order, which is expected to be appealed, was not immediately clear. Neither Corcoran nor his lawyer returned messages seeking comment, and a spokesman for special counsel Jack Smith, who is leading the investigation, also did not respond to an email about the order.A Trump spokesman said the Trump team would “fight the Department of Justice on this front and all others that jeopardize fundamental American rights and values.”Corcoran had already appeared weeks ago before the federal grand jury in Washington investigating the Mar-a-Lago matter, but he had invoked attorney-client privilege in declining to answer certain questions. That privilege protects lawyers from being forced to share with prosecutors details of the conversations they have with clients.Prosecutors can get around that privilege if they can convince a judge that an attorney's services were being used in furtherance of a crime — a principle known as the crime-fraud exception. The Justice Department invoked that exception in this case, arguing to Beryl Howell, the outgoing chief judge of the federal court in Washington, D.C., that more testimony was needed.Howell issued her order granting at least some additional testimony before the end of her tenure Friday as chief judge. She is being replaced as chief judge by James “Jeb” Boasberg, a fellow Obama appointee who has served on the federal bench since 2011.Corcoran is regarded as relevant to the investigation in part because last year he drafted a statement to the Justice Department asserting that a “diligent search” for classified documents had been conducted at Mar-a-Lago in response to a subpoena. Months later, though, FBI agents searched the home with a warrant and found roughly 100 additional documents with classified markings.The Justice Department is investigating whether Trump or anyone in his orbit obstructed its efforts to recover all the classified documents, which included top-secret material, from his home.As chief judge, Boasberg will have oversight of federal grand juries, including ones handling Trump matters, in the courthouse and will preside over sealed disputes like the Corcoran one.Separately, former Vice President Mike Pence has said he will challenge a grand jury subpoena that seeks to compel him to testify in the special counsel's Jan 6. investigation. Pence has argued that because he was serving in his role as president of the Senate on Jan. 6, as he presided over a joint session of Congress to certify the election results, he is protected from being forced to address his actions under the Constitution’s “speech-or-debate” clause that shields members of Congress.It is not clear how that disagreement will be resolved.____Follow Eric Tucker on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/etuckerAP",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839196,US ships mega generators to ease outages in Puerto Rico,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — Puerto Rico’s governor announced Friday that the U.S. government has shipped three mega generators to the island to help stabilize the U.S. territory’s rickety electric grid and minimize continuing outages.The generators will add 150 megawatts of power, and additional generators that the U.S. is expected to ship soon will supply another 250 megawatts, Gov. Pedro Pierluisi said.Officials said crews will install the generators before the start of the Atlantic hurricane season on June 1.“It’s the first step in a very, very complex process,” said Nancy Casper, a coordinator with the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency.FEMA is paying for 90% of the project and Puerto Rico’s government the remaining 10% as part of a deal reached last year, but both Casper and Pierluisi said the total cost was not yet available because it would depend in part on how long the generators will operate.Puerto Rico only recently started permanent repairs on an aging power grid razed by Hurricane Maria, a Category 4 storm that struck the island in September 2017. Since then, power outages have become a common occurrence, disrupting daily life on the island of 3.2 million people.The federal government has allocated some $12 billion — most of it for the grid reconstruction — but only 18 permanent projects totaling $88 million have been completed as of early March, according to the nonpartisan think tank Center for a New Economy.“At this pace, it would take over 100 years to complete the reconstruction of the Puerto Rico electric grid,” the center said in an analysis published Thursday.The power grid was further weakened by Hurricane Fiona, a Category 1 storm that hit Puerto Rico’s southwest region in September 2022. It sparked an island-wide blackout and caused more than $3 billion in damage to the crumbling electric system.“The temporary generation is critical,” Casper said of the new generators.The temporary power boost will allow crews to take substations, transformers and breakers offline for repairs that could take anywhere from 12 to 18 months.Puerto Rico’s power grid was already shaky before Hurricane Maria struck, with officials blaming decades of mismanagement and neglect. Its generation units are on average 45 years old, twice those of the U.S. mainland.The grid’s ongoing problems come as Puerto Rico’s Electric Power Authority struggles to restructure more than $9 billion in debt, the largest of any government agency. A majority of creditors have yet to reach a deal with a federal control board overseeing the island’s finances despite six years of acrimonious negotiations.In June 2020, the island’s power company privatized transmission and distribution operations, and in January, it announced that it had selected a private company to operate and maintain its generation units.",2023/3/18,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839199,State voter fraud system fractures as Republicans opt out,"ATLANTA (AP) — Election officials from states enrolled in a bipartisan effort to ensure accurate voter lists decided Friday against making rule changes that had been pushed by Republicans amid conspiracies targeting the group, prompting more GOP-leaning states to leave.The Electronic Registration Information Center, known as ERIC, has a record of combating voter fraud by identifying those who have died or moved between states. Yet it also has drawn suspicion among some Republican state leaders, after a series of online stories surfaced last year questioning the center's funding and purpose.Earlier this month, Republican election officials from Florida, Missouri and West Virginia said they planned to withdraw from the group, joining Louisiana and Alabama. Former President Donald Trump, on social media, has called on every Republican-led state to leave, characterizing it as a ""terrible Voter Registration System that ’pumps the rolls' for Democrats and does nothing to clean them up.”On Friday, representatives from the group's member states met remotely for about three hours to discuss the changes promoted by Republicans, which included dropping a requirement for members to mail notices to people who are eligible but not registered to vote. Currently, ERIC is comprised of 32 states and the District of Columbia, but that number will drop once Alabama, Florida, Missouri and West Virginia formally depart later this year.After Friday's meeting, Republican secretaries of state in Iowa and Ohio became the latest to say they would pull out.“The action Ohio is taking today follows nearly a year of good faith, bipartisan efforts to reform ERIC’s oversight and services,” Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, who is considering a run for U.S. Senate in 2024, wrote in a letter. ""Unfortunately, these attempts to save what could be an unparalleled election integrity service have fallen short.”Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate said he would recommend to the governor and Legislature that the state end its membership in ERIC because of the organization’s decision not to amend the membership agreement. He also said the departure of several other states makes the network less valuable.ERIC's executive director, Shane Hamlin, said in an emailed statement that “serious consideration” was given to the proposals but the members voted to maintain the program's current requirements.“We hope all states will choose to be members of ERIC, as it is the most effective tool available to help ensure voter rolls are as accurate as possible and to detect possible cases of illegal voting,” Hamlin said.West Virginia Secretary of State Mac Warner, a Republican, will push ahead with the state's plans to leave the system, spokesperson Mike Queen said after Friday's meeting.The departures have frustrated some state election officials who remain involved in the effort.“It’s notable that the states at the forefront of these attacks, who have a newfound desire to opt out of sending eligible citizens information on how to register to vote, are led by Republican politicians who are actively trying to curry favor from their party’s extremists and, in most cases, Trump himself, to further their own future aspirations for higher office,"" said Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat, in a statement.The states' departures threaten to undermine a voluntary effort that has stood for more than a decade as the only national system that helps states identify voters who are not eligible to cast a ballot.The system works by states sharing certain data through secure channels, allowing election officials to identify and remove people from voter rolls who have died or moved to other states. ERIC also helps states identify and ultimately prosecute people who vote in multiple states.The system has been credited in Maryland with identifying some 66,000 potentially deceased voters and 778,000 people who may have moved out of state since 2013. In Georgia, officials said nearly 100,000 voters no longer eligible to vote in the state had been removed based on data provided by ERIC.One conspiracy targeting the system claims that billionaire philanthropist George Soros funded it. While the voter data-sharing system did receive initial funding from the nonpartisan Pew Charitable Trusts, that money was separate from funding provided to Pew by a Soros-affiliated organization that went to an unrelated effort, Hamlin said. The system has since been funded through annual dues by member states.It appeared likely that other Republican-led states could also leave. Alaska “will continue to review its membership in ERIC and we do not intend to make any immediate decisions,” Division of Elections spokesperson Tiffany Montemayor said in an email to the AP.In Texas, state election officials announced plans last week to conduct their own “interstate voter registration crosscheck program,” although it’s unclear how they plan to do that and how effective such an effort would be, especially if it involves only a handful of states. Meanwhile, legislation has been introduced that would compel Texas to withdraw from ERIC.Florida and Texas, with their combined 30.5 million active registered voters, would pose a considerable loss to the data-sharing effort.With no national voter registration clearinghouse, ERIC is the only data-sharing program among the states. It was started in 2012 by seven states and was bipartisan from the beginning, with four of the founding states led at the time by Republicans.In California, Kansas and New Hampshire, lawmakers have introduced bills that would enable their states to join it, according to the Voting Rights Lab, which tracks voting legislation. New York is another high-population state that does not belong to the system.One change sought by Republicans was removing what they characterize as partisan influences within ERIC. They had targeted David Becker, a former U.S. Justice Department lawyer who served in both the Clinton and Bush administrations. Becker, who was involved in developing the ERIC system at Pew, has held one of two non-voting seats on the board. The other has been vacant.A group of Republicans, including Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and former Kentucky Secretary of State Trey Grayson, defended Becker in a public letter, blasting attacks against him as disinformation.Becker, who now leads the Center for Election Innovation and Research, said this week that he has informed ERIC that he will not accept re-nomination to the board. Hamlin said ERIC member states decided Friday to eliminate both non-voting seats on the board.“The states that remain in ERIC have bravely fought back against disinformation and election denial, and my hope is that they will continue to do so, and support their local election officials who rely upon the ERIC data, as we head into 2024,"" Becker said in a social media post this week.—-Smyth reported from Columbus, Ohio.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839200,Q&A: Code Kunst on new album and his love for Mac Miller,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Producer Code Kunst arguably one of the most well-known artists in South Korea’s thriving music scene, a rarity in a country where singers get most of the attention.His fame comes from his nearly decadelong career churning out hit songs with some of the country’s biggest names. For his latest album, “Remember Archive,” he teamed up with global K-pop stars Wendy and Mino and hip-hop acts like Gaeko, Tiger JK and Jay Park.The covers of previous Code Kunst releases have featured colors like yellow and pink, but for his fifth album, he went with red. He says the color most closely matches the “memories that remain very strong in my head” that inspired the 17 tracks on “Remember Archive.”The producer, whose real name is name is Jo Sung-woo, didn’t take music as a career seriously until he was in his 20s and completed mandatory military service. His first album, “Novel,” was released in 2014.Since then, the 33-year-old steadily carved out his presence in the local music scene by churning out endless quality music. He says he has written around 1,500 songs so far, 250 songs of which have been released.He also caught the public’s eyes by appearing in popular local shows including a rap battle series “Show Me the Money” and a reality show “I Live Alone” where he is known as a fashion aficionado with an extremely small appetite.In an interview, the hitmaker talked about his passion for music, the origins of his stage name and his utmost respect for late Mac Miller.Remarks have been edited for clarity and brevity. ___ AP: Tell us the story behind your stage name.CODE KUNST: When I was young, I noticed a word “Kunst” from my mom’s book which appeared multiple times. Later, when I looked up the word out of curiosity, I learned that it means “art” in German. I am not saying I am this great artist but I want to honestly document emotions and time I experienced with arts. So I used the word to name myself so I can remind myself about the origin of the name and hold onto it if I ever want to quit or don’t like myself at certain times.AP: What's your favorite song from the latest album?CODE KUNST: It’s ‘Jumper (Feat. Gaeko, MINO).’ When I was young, I thought artists from the music industry are all glitz and glam. But I feel like now it has become a market where artists have to work harder for their fans and appeal to them for my music.

(AP) — A North Carolina teenager who was struck by a car this week while departing a school bus in Halifax County is now in good condition, a hospital spokesperson said Friday.Tillman Mitchell, a 17-year-old student at the Haliwa-Saponi Tribal School in Hollister, had just exited the school bus and was walking across the street to his house when he was hit by a 2022 Tesla Model Y, according to the State Highway Patrol.He was flown to WakeMed with life-threatening injuries Wednesday afternoon and was listed in good condition Friday morning, said hospital spokesperson Kristin Kelly.The driver, identified as Dr. Howard Gene Yee, a 51-year-old dentist in Roanoke Rapids, failed to stop for the stopped school bus, which highway patrol said was displaying all of its activated warning devices.First Sgt. Christopher Knox of the State Highway Patrol said the initial assessment indicated it was a case of distracted driving. Investigators are looking into whether the Tesla was in autopilot mode at the time of the crash, he said.Yee was placed in the Halifax County Jail under a $25,000 secured bond and charged with reckless driving and “passing stop school bus striking a person,"" according to the North Carolina Department of Public Safety.Yee's dental office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839202,2nd Vatican official says pope OK'd ransom payments for nun,"VATICAN CITY (AP) — A second high-ranking Holy See official told a Vatican court on Friday that Pope Francis had authorized spending hundreds of thousands of euros in ransom payments to try to free a nun who was kidnapped by al-Qaida-linked militants in Mali.Archbishop Edgar Pena Parra, the Holy See's No. 3, told the Vatican tribunal that he had sought, and received Francis’ approval to wire the money soon after he took up his duties as the “substitute” in the secretariat of state in late 2018.Pena Parra was answering questions for a second day Friday after being called by defense attorneys representing the 10 people on trial for a host of alleged financial crimes.One tangent of the Vatican trial concerns 575,000 euros wired from the Vatican’s Swiss Bank account to a Slovenian-based front company owned by Cecilia Marogna, a self-styled security analyst who was hired in 2016 by Pena Parra’s predecessor, Cardinal Angelo Becciu, as an outside consultant.Becciu told the court last year that he had sought Marogna’s advice in 2017 following the kidnapping of Sister Gloria Cecilia Narvaez by al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb, which has bankrolled its insurgency by kidnapping Westerners. During her captivity in Mali, the group periodically showed Narvaez on video asking for the Vatican’s help.Becciu told the court that Francis had authorized spending up to 1 million euros to free the Colombian nun. Becciu said he and Marogna had travelled to London to meet with, and subsequently hire, the British security firm Inkerman to find Narvaez and secure her freedom. She was ultimately released in October 2021.In their indictment request, prosecutors alleged a double payment: They said some 500,000 British pounds, or the then-equivalent of 575,000 euros, had been sent to Inkerman’s Barklays Bank account for the operation. Separately, they listed nine payments from the Vatican's Swiss Bank account totaling 575,000 euros sent to Marogna’s Logsic DOO company from Dec. 20, 2018 to July 8, 2019. Citing Slovenian bank records, prosecutors allege that Marogna used the money to buy high-end luxury items and go on vacation.Both Becciu and Marogna are accused of embezzlement, charges they both deny.Pena Parra, who replaced Becciu as “substitute,” told the court that he was confronted with the request for payment to the Slovenian account by his deputy, Monsignor Alberto Perlasca, who had been asked by Becciu to process the wire transfer. But Pena Parra said he couldn’t proceed without first securing the pope’s approval.“I went to the pope. I asked for an audience and the Holy Father confirmed to me the destination of this money, which was for the question of the possible freedom of the Colombian nun kidnapped in Mali,” Pena Parra said under questioning by the tribunal president, Judge Giuseppe Pignatone.Becciu, for his part, insisted in a spontaneous declaration to the court on Friday that Francis had approved the operation and was prepared to write a statement for Becciu’s defense to that effect when they spoke by telephone on July 19, 2021, days before the trial opened.Prosecutors recently produced an exchange of letters between Becciu and Francis in the following days in which Francis refused to provide the statement. Becciu produced a letter Friday indicating Francis himself had asked Becciu to provide a draft statement, and the cardinal suggested that his subsequent refusal to sign off on it appeared to have been coached.",2023/3/18,,World

(AP) — Free agent long snapper Joe Cardona is returning to the Patriots on a new four-year contract worth $6.3 million, a person with knowledge of the negotiation said Friday.The person spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because the contract hadn’t been announced.The deal was first reported by NFL Network.The Patriots also announced the signings of receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster, safety Jabrill Peppers and running back James Robinson.Cardona has been a staple part of New England's special teams since joining the team as an undrafted free agent in 2015. He appeared in every game each of his first seven years in the league, but missed the finals three games last season after being placed on injured reserve with a foot injury.He will be working with a new punter next season after 2020 All-Pro Jake Bailey was released last week.Peppers was solid in his first season in New England, appearing in 17 games with five starts last year and posting 52 total tackles with one fumble recovery and eight special teams tackles.He likely isn't the top candidate to step into the role left by Devin McCourty's retirement, but he will be counted on to provide support alongside fellow safeties Adrian Phillips and Kyle Dugger.Robinson started his career in Jacksonville in 2020, rushing for a career-high 1,070 yards and notching seven rushing touchdowns as a rookie, He spent parts of three seasons with the Jaguars before being dealt to the Jets this past October. He appeared in four games for New York, but was not tendered a contract as a restricted free agent — making him an unrestricted free agent.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFLThe New England Patriots announced today that they have signed three free agents.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839204,Binnington was 'hoping for less' than 2-game suspension,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Jordan Binnington loved the thrill of 18,000 St. Louis Blues fans cheering for him after an altercation with Minnesota's Ryan Hartman.The ensuing suspension? Not so much.Binnington on Friday said he “hoped for less” than the two-game ban the NHL's Department of Player Safety decided on for roughing and unsportsmanlike conduct after his first experience having a disciplinary hearing that made him feel a little like Matt Damon.“It felt like I was in ‘Good Will Hunting’ acting as Will trying to defend himself in trial,"" Binnington said. ""A new experience, for sure, and definitely not something I want to go through all the time.”Binnington's first career suspension will cost him just under $64,865 and keep him out of games at Washington and then at home against Winnipeg on Saturday. He was suspended for throwing a punch at Hartman that he argued never landed.“I was just reiterating that he knows how to embellish a play,"" Binnington said in his first public comments since the suspension was announced Thursday. “I watched the video numerous times. I never made contact with him.”Nevertheless, coach Craig Berube did not seem surprised at Binnington's punishment.“You use your blocker like that, there’s a pretty good chance you’re gonna get suspended,” Berube said. ""That’s it. That’s really all I have to say about it.”While teammate Robert Thomas said it hurts to lose Binnington — “an important part of our team” — for two games, the 29-year-old who backstopped the Blues to the Stanley Cup as a rookie in 2019 felt it important to join the team on their one-game road trip even knowing he wasn't eligible to play.“I’m trying to stay around the boys and around the team and not get too far away, keep your mind off things,” Binnington said. “I would rather be here with the group and keeping the routine. It’s a new experience testing out that suspended life.”Top goaltending prospect Joel Hofer was recalled to take Binnington's place and start against the Capitals, making his season debut and playing in his third NHL game.""I’ve been waiting for the call all year,"" Hofer said.The call from the league is something Binnington was not waiting for, and he said getting married and turning 30 could make for “a new JB” in the future.___Follow AP Hockey Writer Stephen Whyno on Twitter at https://twitter.com/SWhyno___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839205,Ghana president among mourners at funeral of Christian Atsu,"ACCRA, Ghana (AP) — Ghana's president was among hundreds of mourners Friday who paid their last respects at the funeral of Christian Atsu, the soccer player who died last month in the Turkey earthquake.President Nana Akufo-Addo, Vice President Mahamudu Bawumia, former President John Mahama and government ministers all attended the service at State House, the seat of the West African nation's parliament.Atsu's casket was draped in the red, yellow and green flag of Ghana and was carried by soldiers wearing blue dress uniforms with white belts. It was laid on a podium surrounded by white flowers.Atsu's widow, Marie Claire Rupio, began reading a tribute to the former Premier League player but broke down in tears and gave the speech to Atsu's sister to finish.“In life, I loved you, in death, I do the same. It breaks my heart to lose you,” her tribute read. “You did not go alone. Part of you in me left with you. Your love is still my guide, though I cannot see you. Your smile, your love, I see in my children’s smile.”Atsu, who was 31, had three children with Rupio. They also attended their father's funeral.Atsu's remains were recovered from a collapsed apartment building where he lived in the Turkish city of Antakya on Feb. 18, nearly two weeks after the devastating earthquake struck southern Turkey. It left more than 52,000 people dead in Turkey and neighboring Syria.Atsu had joined the Antakya-based soccer club Hatayspor late last year and scored the winning goal for his new team in a league game at home on Feb. 5, just hours before the earthquake struck in the pre-dawn hours of Feb. 6.He played more than 60 times for Ghana's national team and scored on his debut as a 20-year-old in 2012. He was part of the Ghana squad at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil and starred at the 2015 African Cup of Nations, scoring two goals to help Ghana to the final, where it lost in a penalty shootout to Ivory Coast.He was named the player of the tournament at that African Cup.Atsu had spells at Premier League clubs Chelsea and Newcastle, and while his soccer career was a success, he was also remembered at his funeral for his charitable work. Atsu was involved in numerous charities in Ghana, including one that helped former prisoners get jobs and their lives back on track after serving their sentences. He was also a major donor and regular visitor to an orphanage.“The departure of a patriot full of wisdom, humility and caring is very painful,"" Ghana Sports Minister Mustapha Yussif said at the funeral. ""The painful loss of Atsu has undoubtedly created an indelible imprint on the minds and hearts of compatriots, friends, family and (the) nation.“At the peak of his career, Atsu remained himself and was not overtaken by pride and arrogance and indiscipline.”Atsu will be buried in his hometown of Ada Foah on the south coast of Ghana.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/18,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839210,Scientists slam plans for world's largest octopus farm,"Nueva Pescanova, a seafood company, has been breeding octopuses in captivity for years with the intent of applying for a permit to farm them in the Canary Islands.In 2019, the company said it had found a way to breed the animals at large scale for commercial purposes. No company had figured out a way to do this before then.Octopus sold as food is usually either caught in the wild or bred in small octopus farms in the middle of the ocean — but those farms are a fraction of the size of Nueva Pescanova's proposed farm. The company says it is responding to growing demand in Japan and the US.But octopus experts have criticized the plans Nueva Pescanova's because of the way it says it would kill the animals. Octopuses were declared sentient and capable of feeling pain in a large study published in 2021.DW has seen the plans, which were leaked and shared by someone close to the matter in Spain. Nueva Pescanova did not respond to phoned requests for comment in time for publication of this article.The records indicate the company plans to breed around one million octopuses per year, producing around 3,000 tons of octopus meat.The octopuses would be slaughtered using a method called ice slurry slaughter. That involves submerging the animals in 500-liter plastic containers of icy water where they would develop hypothermia and eventually freeze to death.Keri Tietge, an octopus expert at Eurogroup for Animals, an animal rights campaign group based in Brussels, said ice slurry slaughter results in a ""really prolonged and painful death for the octopuses.""The European Union's Food Safety Authority advises against the use of this method for several fish species already and is in the process of drafting legislation to end its use on sea bass and seabream as well.Zoe Doubleday, a University of South Australia marine ecologist, said ""there are humane ways to euthanize or kill an octopus, but placing them directly into ice slurry is not best practice.""Doubleday said the octopuses could be anesthetized via immersion in seawater mixed with a small amount of magnesium salts or around 3% ethanol before they are killed.But it’s unclear whether octopuses killed in this fashion are safe for human consumption.According to the leaked documents, Nueva Pescanova plans to breed octopuses in tightly packed areas — around 10-15 octopuses per cubic meter — and exposed to 24 hours of light when they are in periods of reproduction.Doubleday said these conditions sounded ""inhumane and stressful, particularly as they are generally nocturnal animals and do not like bright artificial lights.""""All species are different, but octopuses generally need 'dens' in their tanks (like pipes or pots),"" said Doubleday.A farm of the nature suggested by Nueva Pescanova represented a controlled environment, said Doubleday, which would make it easier to kill the animals humanely.""If we are going to do something new like octopus farming, we should get the animal welfare part right,"" she said.If the permit is approved by Canary Island officials, Nueva Pescanova will be able to move forward with the construction of its proposed octopus farm. Tietge said this decision could be made ""any day.""""They put in the applications over a year ago now,"" Tietge said. ""So they're planning to move on this very quickly. And since they already have the animals in their laboratory, in theory, they could start selling them quite quickly once they have the farm built.""Edited by: Zulfikar Abbany",2023/3/17,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839211,Pakistan: Court halts arrest warrant for ex-PM Imran Khan,"An arrest warrant for Pakistan's ex-Prime Minister Imran Khan was lifted Friday, allowing him to travel to Islamabad without being held to face charges in a corruption case.One of the country's top courts suspended an arrest warrant issued against the politician after he failed to show up for a hearing on Tuesday.Khan has been holed up at his home in the eastern city of Lahore after his supporters hurled stones and clashed with police for two days to protect the former prime minister from being detained.The court ruling was expected to ease the political standoff. The former-cricket-star-turned-politician is due in court on Saturday.Khan was told he could face contempt proceedings if he again fails to show up before the judge.Maryam Sharif, a top leader in Sharif's ruling Pakistan Muslim League party, criticized the former PM for resisting arrest and lauded the security forces for their restraint.""The state can arrest him in five minutes, but it exercised restraint to avoid bloodshed,"" she said.Khan is accused of selling gifts given to him by foreign dignitaries when he was prime minister and concealing assets, which he denies.The Election Commission of Pakistan found him guilty and barred him from holding public office for one parliamentary term.The case is one of a string of legal woes facing Khan since his ouster last April.Most of the other charges against him involve incitement to violence.Khan, who was in office from 2018 to 2022, was ousted in a no-confidence vote that he claims was part of a conspiracy by his successor, Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif, and the United States.Both Washington and Sharif's government have denied the allegations.Since then, the 70-year-old has been demanding a snap election and holding protests across the country.Khan has avoided several court appearances since November when he was wounded in a gun attack at a protest rally in the eastern Punjab province.Khan says he fears for his life if detained, and has accused authorities of wanting him in jail to stop him from contesting the election, which must be held by October this year.After the warrant was lifted on Friday, Khan left his home for the first time in days to appear in court in Lahore in a case related to this week's clashes.He still enjoys a huge grassroots following and a large crowd of supporters mobbed his convoy as it slowly exited the compound, cheering and waving party flags.Judges later granted Khan reprieves from possible arrest until March 24 in nine other court cases.The political wrangling comes as Pakistan remains mired in an economic crisis, awaiting a bailout package of $1.1 billion (€1.03 billion) from the International Monetary Fund.The security situation is also deteriorating with a spate of deadly attacks on police, allegedly linked to the Pakistan Taliban.mm/ar (AFP, AP, Reuters)",2023/3/17,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839223,Washington State's March Madness soundtrack? Shania Twain,"VILLANOVA, Pa. (AP) — Man, the Washington State women's basketball team has felt like big winners since they adopted Shania Twain's monster 1997 hit “Man, I Feel Like A Woman” as the their theme song on their run into March Madness.The Cougars sing Twain’s song in the locker room before games. And after they unexpectedly won the Pac-12 Tournament title, the opening riff blared on the speakers and the team about drowned out Twain, gleefully singing along about men's shirts, short skirts — and becoming the lowest-seeded team to ever win the conference tourney.“We truly are a team of karaoke,” forward Ula Motuga said Friday. “The bus ride, there’s no doubt someone’s got a speaker going and then other people will sing along. Some can sing, some cannot. But it’s fun. It’s something that bring us together.”Motuga, who's from Australia, has even used the opening line, “let’s go, girls” as a team anthem.Twain, on tour and unavailable for comment, has become a fan. The five-time Grammy winnerretweeted the Cougars’ team account, writing after the Pac-12 title game, “I’m honored to have been a small part of your journey!!”Why stop at a locker room sing-along? The fifth-seeded Cougars tweeted at Twain that it wants to join her on stage on April 28 when her tour stops in Spokane, Washington, about 75 miles north of campus.“You feeling a duet with the Cougs that night?” WSU tweeted.Motuga is feeling confident: ""We will be going on stage. She doesn’t know it yet, but yes.”Washington State also is feeling some confidence going into its opening-round NCAA Tournament game Saturday against Florida Gulf Coast at Villanova's campus — Wazzu's third straight NCAA appearance.The Cougs won four games in five days in the Pac-12 Tournament, beating No. 10 seed California, No. 2 seed Utah, No. 3 seed Colorado and finally UCLA. They're the first women's team at Washington State to win a conference championship.Coach Kamie Ethridge joked that her players are better backup singers.“They’re not shy about singing,” Ethridge said. “You’ll hear all different tunes and loudness. I don’t know that I would say it’s great. But I would say it’s a blast to watch them enjoy the whole process. “But Shania, Shania is the lead singer.""Twain isn’t the only famous fan throwing her support behind the Cougars: President Joe Biden picked them to beat FGCU — though he has the Cougars losing to his national championship pick, Villanova, in the second round.“President Biden, man!” Motuga said. “I think it’s cool to see a bunch of different people and public figures tuning in. It just shows the support they have for women’s basketball, especially, and more people are buying into creating a bracket.”____ AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839224,Former Air Force officer gets prison term for Capitol attack,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A retired Air Force officer who stormed the U.S. Capitol dressed in combat gear and carried zip-tie handcuffs into the Senate gallery was sentenced on Friday to two years in prison.Larry Brock joined other rioters on the Senate floor only minutes after then-Vice President Mike Pence, senators and their staff evacuated the chamber to escape the mob attacking the building on Jan. 6, 2021.U.S. District Judge John Bates also sentenced Brock to two years of supervised release after his prison term and ordered him to perform 100 hours of community service. Brock, who declined to speak in court before the judge imposed his sentence, remains free until he must report to prison at a date to be determined.Prosecutors had recommended a sentence of five years in prison followed by three years of supervised release.Bates convicted Brock in November after a trial without a jury. The judge said Brock expressed ""very troubling"" and violent rhetoric before the Jan. 6 riot. The judge read aloud several of Brock's social media postings calling it “really pretty astounding” that a former high-ranking military officer expressed those words.“That's chilling stuff, and it does reflect a purpose to stop the certification of the election,” Bates said.Brock believed baseless conspiracy theories that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from Republican incumbent Donald Trump, prosecutors said.“When we get to the bottom of this conspiracy we need to execute the traitors that are trying to steal the election, and that includes the leaders of the media and social media aiding and abetting the coup plotters,"" Brock wrote in a Nov. 9. 2020, post on Facebook.In a Facebook message to another user on Christmas Eve, Brock outlined what he called a “plan of action if Congress fails to act” on Jan. 6. One of the “main tasks” in his plan was to “seize all Democratic politicians and Biden key staff and select Republicans.”""Begin interrogations using measures we used on al-Qaida to gain evidence on the coup,"" he wrote.Brock, a Texas native who lived in the Dallas area, flew combat missions in Afghanistan before retiring from the Air Force as a lieutenant colonel.His “plan of action” also called for a “general pardon for all crimes up to and including murder of those restoring the Constitution and putting down the Democratic Insurrection.”“Do not kill LEO unless necessary,” he wrote, apparently referring to law enforcement officers.Brock didn’t engage in any violence on Jan. 6, but prosecutors said his behavior was “disturbingly premediated.”“Had the Senate Gallery not been emptied minutes before, Brock could have come face-to-face with the politicians he had fantasized about seizing and interrogating,” they wrote in a court filing.Bates convicted Brock of all six counts in his indictment, including obstruction of an official proceeding, the Jan. 6 joint session of Congress for certifying President Joe Biden's electoral victory, The obstruction charge is a felony; the other five counts are misdemeanors.Defense attorney Charles Burnham said it is “inconceivable that (Brock) was motivated by anything other than genuine concern for democracy.”“If Mr. Brock was sincerely motivated by high ideals, it significantly reduces his culpability even if the Court should privately disagree with his view,” Burnham wrote in a court filing.Brock attended the “Stop the Steal” rally where Trump addressed a crowd of supporters on Jan. 6. He was wearing a helmet and tactical vest when he joined the mob that attacked the Capitol. He entered the building through Senate wing doors roughly 12 minutes after other rioters initially breached them.On the floor near the East Rotunda stairs, Brock picked up a discarded pair of zip-tie handcuffs. He held the “flex-cuffs” in his right hand in the Senate gallery. On the Senate floor, he examined paperwork on senators' desks.“This was consistent with Brock’s stated overall mission on January 6, which was intelligence gathering to stop the certification and the transfer of power,” prosecutors wrote.Brock graduated from the Air Force Academy in 1989. He was on active duty until 1998 and served in the reserves until 2014.In a letter to the judge, a retired Air Force major general praised Brock's military service. The major general, whose name was redacted from public court filings, said Brock risked his life to protect U.S. forces from a Taliban attack, flying below mountain peaks into a valley “saturated with enemy forces.”""The result thwarted enemy advances on U.S. personnel, saved U.S. lives and defused an ever-escalating situation for the forces at that remote base in Afghanistan,” the major general wrote.Brock was employed as a commercial airline pilot on Jan. 6. His lawyer said the Federal Aviation Administration revoked Brock's licenses after his January 2021 arrest.Approximately 1,000 people have been charged with federal crimes related to the Jan. 6 riot. More than 400 of them have been sentenced, with over half getting terms of imprisonment ranging from seven days to 10 years.",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839225,Arizona women open March Madness with win over West Virginia,"COLLEGE PARK, Md. (AP) — When Shaina Pellington left the game with four fouls early in the third quarter, Arizona didn't miss a beat.In fact, freshman Kailyn Gilbert helped the Wildcats pull away.Cate Reese scored 25 points and Esmery Martinez had a double-double against her former team, leading seventh-seeded Arizona to a 75-62 victory over 10th-seeded West Virginia in the women's NCAA Tournament on Friday. The Wildcats went on a 16-3 run in the second half with Pellington on the bench.“To be honest, I did not know how to take it at first, because I thought I wasn’t even going to go back in,” Gilbert said. “But then I was like, ‘You know what? I work hard every day. I’m in the gym. These are the moments I work for and I feel like I’m made for.’ I was just going to go in and have energy.”Gilbert scored five points in 14:05, the longest outing for the 5-foot-8 guard since Jan. 29.The Wildcats (22-9) started fast and never trailed, and will next play second-seeded Maryland. Arizona entered the tournament on a three-game losing streak, but had a couple weeks off before this matchup.The Wildcats seemed refreshed early on, shooting 72% from the field in the first quarter. West Virginia was holding opponents to 61 points per game this season, but Arizona looked ready to breeze past that after just one quarter and a 28-17 lead.“Anything we tried to get into from a defensive standpoint, we really had a hard time slowing them down,” West Virginia coach Dawn Plitzuweit said.The Mountaineers (19-12) eventually settled in. It was a seven-point game at halftime, and Arizona's lead was down to three early in the third. Pellington picked up her third and fourth fouls a few seconds apart in the third, but after two free throws by West Virginia made it 42-39, Arizona eventually pulled away again.It was 61-51 after a foul-filled third quarter, and then the Wildcats scored the first seven points of the fourth. It was 68-57 when Pellington finally returned; she finished with 18 points.Martinez, who played three seasons at West Virginia before transferring to Arizona, had 13 points and 12 rebounds.“I knew she was a little bit more nervous today because I think she really had the itch to do well. I knew something was going on because she was talking to the doctor to get some Pepto or something because of her stomach, so that told me nerves right away,"" Wildcats coach Adia Barnes said. “I’m proud of her today because the difficult thing for Esmery all year has been staying out of foul trouble, not going for blocks, and she had one foul.”JJ Quinerly led West Virginia with 19 points.BIG PICTUREWest Virginia: Plitzuweit guided South Dakota to the Sweet 16 last year, but a run like that didn't materialize with the Mountaineers. They were playing catch-up from the start.Arizona: The Wildcats were in the national title game two seasons ago, so a No. 7 seed isn't exactly what they had in mind, but they were able to impose their will offensively for long enough to win comfortably in this one.AVOIDING MISTAKESWest Virginia had only seven turnovers but was undone by 31% shooting.“I’m proud of our young ladies because we battled back. In a lot of ways, we took care of the basketball against one of the best teams in the country at turning opponents over,"" Plitzuweit said. “We got a lot of really good looks.

(AP) — Dulcy Fankam Mendjiadeu scored 22 points and Elena Tsineke's jumper with 31.2 seconds left in overtime put South Florida ahead for good in a 67-65 victory over No. 9 seed Marquette to start the women's NCAA Tournament on Friday.The Golden Eagles (22-11) had a final look to win, but Mackenzie Hare's 3-pointer went inside the rim and rolled out with a second to play.“What a way to start the NCAA Tournament,” South Florida coach Jose Fernandez said.The Bulls (27-6), who didn't lead for the game's first 38 minutes, rallied several times including from 47-36 down in regulation to tie their mark for wins in a season.Breaking the record this year won't be so easy as South Florida is likely to face the No. 1 overall seed and defending champion South Carolina, undefeated on the year and a huge favorite to advance over No. 16 seed Norfolk State in the Columbia pod’s late game.“We have one day to prepare for them, they have one day to prepare for us,” Fernandez said. “So we'll see.”The Bulls appeared to have the game won at the end of the fourth quarter, ahead 59-55 after Tsineke's 3-pointer with 31.7 to play. But Hare's two foul shots after a South Florida turnover tied things and forced the extra session.The lead changed hands six times in overtime, the last on Tsineke's basket.“This game says we just simply don't give up,” said Tsineke, the senior who made just one of her first nine shots before heating up.She finished with 13 points, 11 of those coming in the fourth quarter and overtime.Fankam Mendjiadeu finished with 16 rebounds for her 24th double-double this season and 56th of her career.It was a disappointing finish for the Golden Eagles (22-11), who built a double-digit lead as Chloe Marotta scored a team-high 25 points. But the 6-foot-1 senior, an all-Big East first-team selection, fouled out with 2:56 to play in OT.“It's the hardest day of the year,” Marquette coach Megan Duffy said.South Florida entered with a mindset on a different ending than in this building a year ago when the Bulls lost the eight-nine match up to No. 8 seed Miami in the NCAA opener of last season's Columbia pod.BIG PICTUREMarquette: The Golden Eagles have gone to two NCAA Tournaments in coach Megan Duffy's four seasons. They have a strong base of young players to build with going forward including Hare and freshman Emily La Chapell. “We're in the dance and we earned every piece of it,” Duffy said.South Florida: The Bulls won the AAC's regular-season title and have a strong one-two combo in Fankam Mendjiadeu and Tsineke that should keep them close against anyone — maybe even the nation's No. 1 team.CASE OF NERVES?Fankam Mendjiadeu acknowledged some nerves as she stood at the foul line in overtime, her team ahead by one and facing a pair of free throws. “I was scared,” she said with a laugh. Fankam Mendjiadeu made one of two, enough to keep the Bulls out front, “so it turned out OK.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839228,"Lack of hugs caused US fentanyl crisis, Mexico's leader says","MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico’s president said Friday that U.S. families were to blame for the fentanyl overdose crisis because they don’t hug their kids enough.The comment by President Andrés Manuel López Obrador caps a week of provocative statements from him about the crisis caused by the fentanyl, a synthetic opioid trafficked by Mexican cartels that has been blamed for about 70,000 overdose deaths per year in the United States.López Obrador said family values have broken down in the United States, because parents don’t let their children live at home long enough. He has also denied that Mexico produces fentanyl.On Friday, the Mexican president told a morning news briefing that the problem was caused by “a lack of hugs, of embraces.”“There is a lot of disintegration of families, there is a lot of individualism, there is a lack of love, of brotherhood, of hugs and embraces,” López Obrador said of the U.S. crisis. “That is why they (U.S. officials) should be dedicating funds to address the causes.”López Obrador has repeatedly said that Mexico's close-knit family values are what have saved it from the wave of fentanyl overdoses. Experts say that Mexican cartels are making so much money now from the U.S. market that they see no need to sell fentanyl in their home market.Cartels frequently sell methamphetamines in Mexico, where the drug is more popular because it purportedly helps people work harder.López Obrador has been stung by calls in the United States to designate Mexican drug gangs as terrorist organizations. Some Republicans have said they favor using the U.S. military to crack down on the Mexican cartels.On Wednesday, López Obrador called anti-drug policies in the U.S. a failure Wednesday and proposed a ban in both countries on using fentanyl in medicine — even though little of the drug crosses from hospitals into the illegal market.U.S. authorities estimate that most illegal fentanyl is produced in clandestine Mexican labs using Chinese precursor chemicals. Relatively little of the illegal market comes from diverting medicinal fentanyl used as anesthesia in surgeries and other procedures.There have been only scattered and isolated reports of glass flasks of medicinal fentanyl making it to the illegal market. Most illegal fentanyl is pressed by Mexican cartels into counterfeit pills made to look like other medications like Xanax, oxycodone or Percocet.",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839229,Appeals court upholds federal conviction of pardoned man,"LONDON, Ky. (AP) — An appeals court has upheld the conviction of a man pardoned by Kentucky’s former governor on state charges for a 2014 drug robbery killing but was later convicted for the same slaying in federal court.A U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals panel released its ruling Thursday, deciding against Patrick Baker's appeal on every point, the Lexington Herald-Leader reported.Federal prosecutors brought charges against Baker after he was released from prison when former Gov. Matt Bevin pardoned him on his way out of office in 2019. Baker’s family had political connections to Bevin, including hosting a fundraiser for the one-term governor.A federal jury in eastern Kentucky convicted Baker on a charge of murder committed during a drug trafficking crime and he was sentenced in 2022 to 42 years in prison.Baker was convicted of reckless homicide in Donald Mills’ death in state court in 2017. He was sentenced to 19 years in prison, but Bevin’s pardon released him and erased the conviction. Bevin called the evidence against Baker “sketchy,” though the former governor did not mention his ties to Baker’s family.Federal prosecutors said Baker was prosecuted the second time under the “dual sovereignty doctrine,” which allows state and federal officials to prosecute the same defendant for the same actions without infringing on double jeopardy protections.Baker's argument that the federal government’s decision to prosecute him was vindictive fell short, the appeals panel said. They cited the separate sovereign doctrine and said that federal prosecutors have broad discretion in decisions to charge people. They also pointed to new evidence in the case and rejected an argument from the defense that evidence wasn't sufficient for a conviction.",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839230,"20 years after U.S. invasion, young Iraqis see signs of hope","BAGHDAD (AP) — On the banks of the Tigris River one recent evening, young Iraqi men and women in jeans and sneakers danced with joyous abandon to a local rap star as a vermillion sun set behind them. It’s a world away from the terror that followed the U.S. invasion 20 years ago.Iraq 's capital today is throbbing with life and a sense of renewal, its residents enjoying a rare, peaceful interlude in a painful modern history. The wooden stalls of the city’s open-air book market are piled skyward with dusty paperbacks and crammed with shoppers of all ages and incomes. In a suburb once a hotbed of al-Qaida, affluent young men cruise their muscle cars, while a recreational cycling club hosts weekly biking trips to former war zones. A few glitzy buildings sparkle where bombs once fell.President George W. Bush called the U.S.-led invasion on March 20, 2003, a mission to free the Iraqi people and root out weapons of mass destruction. Saddam Hussein's government was toppled in 26 days. Two years later, the CIA’s chief weapons inspector reported no stockpiles of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons were ever found.The war deposed a dictator whose imprisonment, torture and execution of dissenters kept 20 million people in fear for a quarter of a century. But it also broke what had been a unified state at the heart of the Arab world, opening a power vacuum and leaving oil-rich Iraq a wounded nation in the Middle East, ripe for a power struggle among Iran, Arab Gulf states, the United States, terrorist groups and Iraq’s own rival sects and parties.For Iraqis, the enduring trauma of the violence that followed is undeniable — an estimated 300,000 Iraqis were killed between 2003 and 2023, according to the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs at Brown University, as were more than 8,000 U.S. military, contractors and civilians. The period was marred by unemployment, dislocation, sectarian violence and terrorism, and years without reliable electricity or other public services.Today, half of Iraq's population of 40 million isn’t old enough to remember life under Saddam or much about the U.S. invasion. In dozens of recent interviews from Baghdad to Fallujah, young Iraqis deplored the loss of stability that followed Saddam’s downfall — but they said the war is in the past, and many were hopeful about nascent freedoms and opportunities to pursue their dreams.___Editor’s note: John Daniszewski and Jerome Delay were in Baghdad 20 years ago when the U.S. bombing began. They chronicled the unraveling of the country that followed, in text and photos. They returned 20 years later for this special report on how the country has changed over two decades — especially for its young people.___In a marbled, chandeliered reception room in the palace where Saddam once lived, seated in an overstuffed damask chair and surrounded by paintings by modern Iraqi artists, President Abdul Latif Rashid, who assumed office in October, spoke glowingly of the country’s prospects. The world’s perception of Iraq as a war-torn country is frozen in time, he told The Associated Press in an interview.Iraq is rich; peace has returned, he said, and there are opportunities ahead for young people in a country experiencing a population boom. “If they’re a little bit patient, I think life will improve drastically in Iraq.”Most Iraqis aren't nearly as bullish. Conversations begin with bitterness that the ouster of Saddam left the country broken and ripe for violence and exploitation by sectarian militias, politicians and criminals bent on self-enrichment or beholden to other nations. Yet, speaking to younger Iraqis, one senses a generation ready to turn a page.___Safaa Rashid, 26, is a ponytailed writer who talks politics with friends at a cozy coffee shop in the Karada district of the capital. With a well-stocked library nook, photos of Iraqi writers and travel posters, the café and its clientele could as easily be found in Brooklyn or London.Rashid was a child when the Americans arrived, but rues “the loss of a state, a country that had law and establishment” that followed the invasion. The Iraqi state lay broken and vulnerable to international and domestic power struggles, he said. Today is different; he and like-minded peers can sit in a coffee shop and freely talk about solutions. “I think the young people will try to fix this situation.”Another day, a different café. Noor Alhuda Saad, 26, a Ph.D. candidate at Mustansiriya University who describes herself as a political activist, says her generation has been leading protests decrying corruption, demanding services and seeking more inclusive elections — and won’t stop till they’ve built a better Iraq.“After 2003, the people who came to power"" — old-guard Sunni and Shiite parties and their affiliated militias and gangs — ""did not understand about sharing democracy,” she said, tapping her pale green fingernails on the tabletop.“Young people like me are born into this environment and trying to change the situation,” she added, blaming the government for failing to restore public services and establish a fully democratic state in the aftermath of occupation. “The people in power do not see these as important issues for them to solve. And that is why we are active.”___Signs of the invasion and insurgency have been largely erased from Baghdad. The former Palestine Hotel, Ferdous Square, the Green Zone, the airport road pockmarked by IED and machine-gun attacks have been landscaped or covered in fresh stucco and paint.The invasion exists only in memory: bright orange flashes and concussions of American “shock-and-awe” bombs raining down in a thunderous cacophony; tanks rolling along the embankment; Iraqi forces battling across the Tigris or wading into water to avoid U.S. troops; civilian casualties and the desperate, failed effort to save a fellow journalist gravely wounded by a U.S. tank strike in the final days of the battle for Baghdad. Pillars of smoke rose over the city as Iraqi civilians began looting ministries and U.S. Marines pulled down the famous Saddam statue.What appeared to be a swift victory for the U.S.-led forces was illusory: The greatest loss of life came in the months and years that followed. The occupation stoked a stubborn guerrilla resistance, bitter fights for control of the countryside and cities, a protracted civil war, and the rise of the Islamic State group that spread terror beyond Iraq and Syria, throughout the Middle East, Africa, Asia and Europe.The long, staggeringly costly experience in Iraq exposed the limitations of America’s ability to export democracy and chastened Washington’s approach to foreign engagements, at least temporarily. In Iraq, its democracy is yet to be defined.___Blast walls have given way to billboards, restaurants, cafes and shopping centers — even over-the-top real estate developments. With 7 million inhabitants, Baghdad is the Middle East’s second-largest city after Cairo, and its streets teem with cars and commerce at all hours, testing the skill of traffic guards in shiny reflective caps.Daily life here looks not so different from any other Arab metropolis. But in the distant deserts of northern and western Iraq, there are occasional clashes with remnants of the Islamic State group. The low-boil conflict involves Kurdish peshmerga fighters, Iraqi army troops and some 2,500 U.S. military advisers still in country.It is but one of the country’s lingering problems. Another is endemic corruption; a 2022 government audit found a network of former officials and businessmen stole $2.5 billion.Meanwhile, digital natives are testing the boundaries of identity and free speech, especially on TikTok and Instagram. They sometimes look over their shoulders, aware that shadowy militias connected to political parties may be listening, ready to squelch too much liberalism. More than a dozen social media influencers were arrested recently in a crackdown on “immoral” content, and this month authorities said they would enforce a long-dormant law banning alcohol imports.In 2019-20, fed-up Iraqis, especially young people, protested across the country against corruption and lack of basic services. After more than 600 were killed by government forces and militias, parliament agreed to a series of election law changes designed to allow more minorities and independent groups to share power.___The sun bakes down on Fallujah, the main city in the Anbar region that was once a hotbed for al-Qaida of Iraq and, later, the Islamic State group. Beneath the iron girders of the city’s bridge across the Euphrates, three 18-year-olds are returning home from school for lunch.In 2004, this bridge was the site of a gruesome tableau. Four Americans from military contractor Blackwater were ambushed, their bodies dragged through the streets, hacked, burned and hung as trophies by local insurgents, while some residents chanted in celebration. For the 18-year-olds, it’s a story they’ve heard from their families — distant and irrelevant to their lives.One wants to be a pilot, two aspire to be doctors. Their focus is on getting good grades, they say.Fallujah today is experiencing a construction renaissance under former Anbar Gov. Mohammed al-Halbousi, now speaker of Iraq’s parliament. He has helped direct millions of dollars in government funding to rebuild the city, which experienced repeated waves of fighting, including two U.S. military campaigns to rid the city of al-Qaida and the Islamic State group.Fallujah gleams with new apartments, hospitals, amusement parks, a promenade and a renewed gate to the city. Its markets and streets are bustling. But officials were wary of letting Western reporters wander the city without an escort. The AP team’s first attempt to enter was foiled at a checkpoint.The prime minister’s office intervened the next day, and the visit was allowed, but only with police following reporters at a distance, ostensibly for protection. The disagreement over security and press access is a sign of the uncertainty that overhangs life here.Still, Dr. Huthifa Alissawi, 40, an imam and mosque leader, says such tensions are trifling compared with what his congregation lived through. Iraq has been engulfed in war for half of his life. When the Islamic State group overran Fallujah, his mosque was seized, and he was ordered to preach in favor of the “caliphate” or be killed. He told them he’d think about it, he said, and then fled to Baghdad. He counted 16 killings of members of his mosque.“Iraq has had many wars. We lost a lot — whole families,” he said. These days, he said, he is enjoying the new sense of security he feels in Fallujah. “If it stays like now, it is perfect.” ___Sadr City, a working-class, conservative and largely Shiite suburb in eastern Baghdad, is home to more than 1.5 million people. In a grid of thickly populated streets, women wear abayas and hijabs and tend to stay inside the house. Fiery populist religious leader Moqtada al-Sadr, 49, is still the dominant political power, though he rarely travels here from his base in Najaf, 125 miles to the south. His portraits, and those of his ayatollah father, killed by gunmen in Saddam's time, loom large.On a clamorous, pollution-choked avenue, two friends have side-by-side shops: Haider al-Saady, 28, fixes tires for taxis and the three-wheeled motorized “tuk-tuks” that jam potholed streets, while Ali al-Mummadwi, 22, sells lumber for construction.Thick skeins of wires hooked up to generators form a canopy over the neighborhood. City power stays on for just two hours at a time; after that, everyone relies on generators.They say they work 10 hours every day and scoff when told of the Iraqi president’s promises that life will be better for the young generation.“It is all talk, not serious,” al-Saady said, shaking his head. Sadr City was a hotbed of anti-Saddam sentiment, but al-Saady — too young to remember the fallen dictator — nevertheless expressed nostalgia for that era's stability.His companion echoes him: “Saddam was a dictator, but the people were living better, peacefully.” Dismissing current officials as pawns of outside powers, al-Mummadwi added, “We would like a strong leader, an independent leader.”___When news spread recently that a musician born and raised in Baghdad whose songs have gotten millions of views on YouTube would headline a rap party hosted at a fancy new restaurant in western Baghdad, his fans shared their excitement via texts and Instagram.Khalifa OG raps about the difficulties of finding work and satirizes authority, but his lyrics aren't blatantly political. A song he performed under strobe lights on a grassy lawn next to the Tigris mocks “sheikhs” who wield power in the new Iraq through wealth or political connections.Fan Abdullah Rubaie, 24, could barely contain his excitement. “Peace for sure makes it easier” for young people to gather like this, he said. His stepbrother Ahmed Rubaie, 30, agreed.The Sunni-Shia sectarianism that led to a pitched civil war in Iraq from 2006 to 2007, with bodies of executed victims turning up each morning on neighborhood streets or dumped into the river, is one of the societal wounds that the rappers and their fans want to heal.“We had a lot of pain ... it had to stop,” Ahmed Rubaie said. “It is not exactly vanished, but it's not like before.”Secular young people say that unlike their parents who lived under Saddam, they’re not afraid to make their voices heard. The 2019 demonstrations gave them confidence, even in the face of backlash from pro-religious parties.“It broke a wall that was there before,” Ahmed Rubaie said.___Iraq’s prime minister, Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, took office in October. A former government minister for human rights and governor of Maysan province, southeast of Baghdad, he won support from a coalition of pro-Iranian Shiite parties after a yearlong stalemate. Unlike other Shiite politicians who fled during the Saddam era, he never left Iraq, even when his father and five brothers were executed.Working in a former Saddam palace that U.S. and British officers and civilian experts once used as headquarters for their frenetic attempts at nation-building, al-Sudani still grapples with some of the issues that plagued the occupiers, including restoring regional relations and balancing interests among Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds. He said building trust between the people and government will be his first priority.“We need to see tangible results — job opportunities, services, social justice,” al-Sudani said. “These are the priorities of the people.”___One of the Shiite militias that took part in that campaign against the Islamic State group is Ketaib Hezbollah, or the Hezbollah Battalions, widely viewed as a proxy for Iran and a cousin to Hezbollah in Lebanon and Syria. It also is part of the political coalition that established al-Sudani’s government.Ketaib Hezbollah’s spokesman, Jafar al-Hussaini, met AP at an outdoor restaurant in Baghdad’s Dijlas Village, an opulent, 5-month-old complex of gardens, spas and a dancing fountain overlooking a bend in the Tigris, an idyllic Xanadu that looks like a transplant from uber-wealthy Dubai.Al-Hussaini voiced optimism for the new Iraqi government and scorn for the United States, saying the U.S. sold Iraq a promise of democracy but failed to deliver infrastructure, electricity, housing, schools or security.“Twenty years after the war, we look towards building a new state,” he said. “Our project is ideological, and we are against America.""___Far from such luxury, 18-year-old Mohammed Zuad Khaman, who toils in his family’s kebab café in one of Baghdad’s poorer neighborhoods, resents the militias’ hold on the country because they are an obstacle to his dreams of a sports career. Khaman is a talented footballer, but says he can’t play in Baghdad’s amateur clubs because he does not have any “in” with the militia-related gangs that control sports teams in the city.He got an offer to train in Qatar, he said, but a broker was charging $50,000, far beyond his family’s means.War and poverty caused him to miss several years of school, he said, and he's trying to get a high school degree. Meanwhile, he takes home about $8-$10 a day wiping tables and serving food and tea. He is among those Iraqis who would like to leave.“If only I could get to London, I would have a different life.”___In contrast, for Muammel Sharba, 38, who managed to get a good education despite the war, the new Iraq offers promise he did not expect.A lecturer in mathematics and technical English at the Middle Technical University campus in Baquba, a once violence-torn city in Diyala, northeast of Baghdad, Sharba left in 2017 for Hungary, where he earned a Ph.D. on an Iraqi government scholarship.He returned last year, planning to fulfil his contractual obligations to his university and then move to Hungary permanently. But he’s found himself impressed by the changes in his homeland and now thinks he will stay.One reason: He discovered Baghdad’s nascent community of bicyclists who gather weekly for organized rides. They recently rode to Samarra, where one of the worst sectarian attacks of the war happened in 2006, a bombing that damaged the city’s 1,000-year-old grand mosque.Sharba became a biking enthusiast in Hungary but never imagined pursuing it at home. He noticed other changes, too: better technology and less bureaucracy that allowed him to upload his thesis and get his foreign Ph.D. validated online. He got a driver’s license electronically in one day. With infrastructure improvements, he's even seen some smoother roads.Security in Diyala isn’t perfect, he said, but it’s less fraught than before. Not all his colleagues are as optimistic, but he prefers to focus on the glass half-full.“I don’t think European countries were always as they are now. They went through a long process and lots of barriers, and then they slowly got better,” he said. “I believe that we need to go through these steps, too.”On a recent evening, a double line of excited cyclists threaded a course through the capital’s busy streets for a night ride, Sharba among them. They raised neon-green-clad arms in a happy salute as they headed out.As daylight ebbed into a crimson sunset, it wasn’t hard to imagine that Iraq, like them, could be on the way to a better place.____John Daniszewski is AP’s vice president for standards and editor at large.

Lahore became the first team to chase successfully in eight PSL games at Lahore this season.Peshawar put up 171-5, led by Mohammad Haris with 85 off 54 balls.Captain Babar Azam chose to bat first in overcast conditions.""After 10 overs the ball reversed a little bit for the pacers and it became a little difficult,” Babar said. “In the end, our bowling was not up to the mark, we were good for eight to nine overs in the field, but not the full 20 (overs).”Lahore’s faith in Baig finally paid off in the crucial game as the opener dominated the unorthodox spin of Mujeeb Ur Rahman (0-35) after Fakhar Zaman fell for 6 early in the run chase and Abdullah Shafique was run out on 15 while going for a second run.Baig added 50 for the third wicket with Sam Billings (28) before he gloved a catch behind.Salman Irshad, whose brilliant bowling in the death overs eliminated Islamabad United on Thursday, bowled Billings off a yorker and Azmatullah Omarzai knocked back the off stump of Sikandar Raza (23) off a full toss with Lahore needing 12 of 14 balls.Shaheen Shah Afridi finished the game in style with a straight four and a six off consecutive balls against Irshad, who returned an expensive 1-42.Earlier, Babar (40) and Haris added 89 off 60 balls.Babar had a let off on 39 when spinner Ahsan Hafeez, in his first game of the season, couldn’t hold a sharp return catch. But one run later, Babar was out lbw off a Rashid Khan googly.Haris, who hit 11 fours and two sixes, tried to accelerate in the death overs but Afridi got him caught at fine leg off a full toss. Peshawar scored only 48 runs in the last five overs.___ More AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839232,Wisconsin Democratic Secretary of State La Follette resigns,"MADISON, Wis. (AP) — Wisconsin's longtime Democratic Secretary of State Doug La Follette abruptly resigned on Friday, saying he was leaving three months into his 11th consecutive term “to focus on my personal needs” after watching the office be stripped of its power over the past 50 years.Gov. Tony Evers appointed former Treasurer Sarah Godlewski, who ran for U.S. Senate last year but dropped out of the race ahead of the primary, to fill out the four-year term. Wisconsin's secretary of state has not been in charge of elections since 1974 and has almost no official duties.“After many years of frustration, I've decided that I don't want to spend the next three and a half years trying to run an office without adequate resources and staffing levels,” the 82-year-old La Follette said in his resignation letter.He did not immediately return a telephone message left seeking comment.La Follette won reelection in November over a Republican who wanted to shift election duties to the office. La Follette said ahead of the election that he was running again to ensure Republicans couldn't use the office to overturn a Democratic presidential win in the state in 2024.He did not campaign very intensely, saying he was afraid of contracting COVID-19 on the campaign trail. Those fears didn't stop him from taking a vacation in Africa in June, however. In the end, his name recognition was enough to carry him to victory, as it had for years.La Follette is a distant relative of “Fighting” Bob La Follette, a progressive Wisconsin governor and 1924 presidential candidate. A Madison high school is named after Bob La Follette and state Democrats still hold him up today as a progressive champion.Evers, also a Democrat, thanked Doug La Follette for his decades of service and named Godlewski to replace him.“In a critical position that has seen no turnover in decades, maintaining continuity with a leader who’s prepared and committed to fulfilling this office’s constitutional obligations could not be more important—and there’s no one more uniquely qualified or better suited for the job than Sarah,"" Evers said in a statement.Godlewski, 41, was 1-year-old when La Follette began his current consecutive run as secretary of state.Godlewski said she was humbled by the appointment. She becomes the third woman to hold the position in state history. She served one term as treasurer, from 2018 to 2022.She ran for U.S. Senate last year on an abortion rights platform but dropped out of the race ahead of the August primary after falling behind Democratic front-runner Mandela Barnes by double digits in public polling. Her name remained on the primary ballot but Barnes won the nomination. He went on to lose to Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson.“To become just the third woman in our state’s history to hold this office is the honor of a lifetime,"" Godlewski said. ""I know how important this role is and my responsibilities are, and I’m looking forward to getting to work.”Godlewski, a native of Eau Claire, formerly worked on Hillary Clinton’s campaigns for president in both 2008 and 2016.Before running for treasurer in 2018, Godlewski led a bipartisan coalition that worked against a measure on the ballot that spring that would have eliminated the treasurer’s office. Voters rejected it, leaving the state treasurer’s office in place but with few official duties.Doug La Follette was first elected secretary of state in 1974. After a failed try for lieutenant governor in 1978, he won the office in 1982 and has won reelection 10 times.Republicans have gradually stripped the office of almost all its duties and staff and relegated Doug La Follette to a cramped office in the Capitol basement. However, since the 2020 presidential election, Republicans have been mulling shifting oversight of elections to the secretary of state.Amy Loudenbeck, the Republican who La Follette beat in November, said those who voted for La Follette should be “upset” and those who voted for her “should be outraged.”“This move coming so soon after the election raises questions once again about the tactics used by those in power who will do anything to keep that power,” she said in a statement.Wisconsin Republican Party Chairman Brian Schimming said Godlewski “will self-promote and use the office to prepare for her next campaign. ”“Now we see why Godlewski ducked out of the US Senate race, as she was apparently promised a soft landing,"" he said.___This story corrects the number of times La Follette has been reelected from nine to 10. It also clarifies that La Follette was in his 11th consecutive term when he resigned.",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839233,Michigan State muscles past USC 72-62 in March Madness,"COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Joey Hauser scored 17 points and No. 7 seed Michigan State clamped down defensively on No. 10 seed Southern California in the second half on Thursday for a 72-62 win in the first round of the NCAA Tournament's East Region.Coach Tom Izzo's Spartans (20-12) will face the winner of the Vermont-Marquette matchup on Sunday for a spot in the Sweet 16. Marquette coach Shaka Smart sat on press row for part of the second half to get a closer look at what could be his next opponent.Smart watched as Michigan State ramped up its defensive intensity after halftime to muzzle the streaky Trojans (22-11), who were knocked out in the tournament's first round for the second straight year.Tyson Walker and Jaden Akins added 12 points apiece for Michigan State, which held USC to 34% shooting in the second half. It felt like every possession was a challenge for the Trojans, who only stayed within range with some late 3-pointers and some atrocious free-throw shooting by Michigan State.The Spartans missed six straight from the line during one stretch while trying to close it out and finished 15 of 25 overall.Joshua Morgan scored 14 and Kobe Johnson 13 to lead USC.Michigan State, appearing in its 25th straight tournament under Izzo, will move on in what has been a unique and challenging season for the Spartans. The team became the face of a grief-stricken school after a gunman killed three students and injured five others in a campus shooting on Feb. 13.Playing in Big Ten country, and backed by a crowd wearing even more green on St. Patrick’s Day, the Spartans took control in the second half. A.J. Hoggard’s steal and layup put Michigan State ahead 58-49.USC struggled to get any good looks at the basket and fell into a bigger hole when Hauser and Jaden Akins buried consecutive 3-pointers as Michigan State’s lead swelled to 66-51 with 4:23 left.Johnson knocked down two 3s to pull USC within nine, but the Trojans couldn’t get any closer.TWO TOMSIzzo showed his soft, nurturing side, especially when he helped his team and the school cope following the tragedy.However, he didn’t like being described as a “teddy bear.”And while he’s not as fiery these days, the 68-year-old is still demanding of his players.“I look in the mirror a lot,” he said, “and sometimes I don’t like what I see in me. And I let the players know that. So maybe the terror side will come out again. I had a parent tell me something two days ago that I really enjoyed: ‘Coach my kid, the hell with the outside stuff. Coach my kid.’“So I’m coaching them. So hopefully I bring that with me this weekend and hopefully our team responds.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/18,,World

They're staying at their grandad's house so I guess it's his rules this weekend so far.“I assumed — and I do still assume — that they will be wearing England jerseys but I see they're trying to sway them.”The Farrells' rivalry is a subplot of the sold-out match, and Owen says family support is toughest for his mum Colleen.""She says she doesn't know what she wants to happen. It's a bit tough for her,” Owen said.“But in terms of us, we're just doing our job. (Andy's) not out there on the field, it's not direct competition. We've been doing it for a long time now.”They have been on opposite sides since Andy was sacked as an assistant coach by England after the 2015 Rugby World Cup. Andy was hired by Ireland as the defense coach in 2016, and became head coach after the 2019 World Cup.In their matchups, Andy leads Owen 4-3.Owen said of Andy, “There's definitely a lot of pride in our family for the job that he's doing.”No. 1-ranked Ireland is heavily favored to achieve only its fourth ever Grand Slam, and first in Dublin.Owen has been restored to flyhalf after being dropped to the bench last week before England was hammered by France 53-10 at Twickenham.“We're hurting a bit from last week,” he said. ""Everybody, especially from the outside, is very down about where we're at at the minute.“That wasn't good enough, it never is in an England shirt. We've been looking at it closely, probably closer than everybody else, and we're looking at what we can do better and trying to get that out on the field tomorrow.”___More AP rugby: https://apnews.com/hub/rugby and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839235,"Seahawks reach deals with Julian Love, Devin Bush","RENTON, Wash. (AP) — The Seattle Seahawks continued the overhaul of their defense on Friday by signing versatile safety Julian Love to a two-year contract.Love's agreement is worth up to $12 million, according to a person with knowledge of the deal, and came after Seattle announced the signing of former first-round linebacker Devin Bush to a one-year deal. The person spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because the team had not announced terms of Love's signing.Love's addition continues Seattle's spending at the safety position having already heavily invested in Jamal Adams, Quandre Diggs and the likelihood of a deal in the future for Ryan Neal. He may also be protection in case Adams isn't fully recovered by the start of the season after he suffered a torn quadriceps tendon in Week 1 of last season.Love, who turns 25 on Sunday, started 16 games last season for the New York Giants and recorded career highs in tackles and interceptions. Love played a variety of defensive back positions for the Giants before settling in at safety last season and thriving in the role.Bush's signing could end up filling a significant void for Seattle. The 24-year-old was the No. 10 overall pick in the 2019 draft by the Pittsburgh Steelers and had a standout rookie season where he had a career-high 109 tackles and was third in defensive rookie of the year voting. But Bush suffered a torn ACL during the 2020 season and has struggled to rediscover the form from his rookie season.Last season, Bush appeared in 17 games and started 14. He had 81 tackles and played 62% of the defensive snaps for the Steelers.He’ll immediately be in consideration for a starting role with Seattle. The Seahawks will start next season without starting linebacker Jordyn Brooks after he suffered a torn ACL late last season. Fellow starter Cody Barton signed with Washington at the start of free agency this week.Even with the signing of Bush, additional options at linebacker are probably needed for Seattle.“It definitely is a need,” Seattle general manager John Schneider said during his radio show on KIRO-AM on Thursday. “I’d be lying to you if (I said) it wasn’t.” ___AP Pro Football Writer Rob Maaddi contributed to this report.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839236,The bitcoin bounce: what comes next?,"Markets this year are roiling, uncertainty abounds and the U.S. government has had to step in to rescue two large American banks in recent days. So why is bitcoin, considered among the riskiest bets of them all, rising so fast?Just months ago, all forms of cryptocurrency appeared to be going up in flames, with bitcoin plunging from almost $50,000 at the start of 2022, to less than $17,000 when 2023 rolled around.Bitcoin has since soared more than 60% and it climbed another 8% Friday above $27,000, all in an era of mass layoffs in the tech sector and widespread anxiety about stability in the U.S. banking sector.So what happened?The pandemic was an era of massive growth for both technology companies and crypto. That surge began to wane in late 2021 as people began to travel, go out to restaurants or catch a show. They spent much less time in front of screens and at the same time, the government stimulus checks that allowed people some financial cushion began to run out. Crypto began to fall in tandem with technology. On top of that, in March 2022, the U.S. Federal Reserve began an aggressive string of rate hikes, its most powerful weapon to fight inflation, which had begun to rise rapidly.That put bitcoin prices in freefall. Higher interest rates mean that safe assets like Treasurys become more attractive to investors because their yields have increased, dulling the shine of high-growth companies and other assets that carry more risk. That includes bitcoin.Yet economic data earlier this year seemed to suggest that inflation had peaked, raising the chance that the Fed would ease off on rate hikes, and that was the start of bitcoin's bounce.How did the recent bank collapses play into all of this?The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank actually fueled investments in bitcoin. In the eyes of Wall Street, a shaky financial system lowered the odds even further that the Fed could continue raising rates, as had been the prevailing expectation as recently as the start of last week, before Silicon Valley Bank blew up.“As the economy heads towards a recession, the cryptoverse could look more attractive than equities,” wrote Edward Moya of Oanda in a research report. “It appears the downside risks are greater for the S&P 500 than they are for Bitcoin.”If an investor on Jan. 1 put $100 into bitcoin and $100 in an S&P 500 index fund, the bitcoin investment would have returned $60, compared with a $2 return on the S&P bet.So will bitcoin keep rising?All eyes now turn to the Federal Reserve, which meets next week and will make a decision on what to do about its benchmark interest rate.What the Fed does may not matter at all as far as bitcoin investors are concerned.“Bitcoin is Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde when it comes to how it reacts to Fed rate expectations,” Moya said. “For most of last year, higher Treasury yields alongside rising Fed rate hike expectations spelled trouble for Bitcoin. Fed rate cut bets are good news for cryptos, but a severe recession should prove troubling for all risky assets, including bitcoin.”",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839237,Bob Odenkirk returns to comedy roots with AMC's 'Lucky Hank',"Bob Odenkirk loves Saul Goodman, but he's also ready to leave the character behind. He played the underhanded, calculating lawyer on “Breaking Bad” and then for six seasons on “ Better Call Saul. ""The Emmy-nominated actor hopes viewers will next take to him in the dark comedy series AMC's “ Lucky Hank,” debuting Sunday, as Hank Devereaux, a college English professor who is department chair at an underfunded college, going through an identity crisis. He wrote a novel that no one read, yet his father's retirement from the academic literary world was covered by the New York Times.“Guys always want to be greater than their dad if they do the same thing or are similar, or they want to be the opposite of their dad and usually they can’t achieve either thing perfectly,"" said Odenkirk recently over Zoom.Odenkirk was drawn to the fact that Hank, with his discontentment and intelligence, is also quite witty. Some may not realize or forget that Odenkirk has a background in comedy. He was a writer on “Saturday Night Live” and worked with some of its most notable breakouts including Adam Sandler, Chris Farley and Chris Rock.“Saul Goodman was funny, but Saul wasn’t aware of how he was funny. Usually he was funny to you, the audience, but he wasn’t trying, but he was utterly serious about what he was doing,"" explained Odenkirk. ""This guy is making jokes. He’s saying things that he knows are funny and meant to be funny. That’s really fun to play. That self-awareness, I love it and it’s one of the reasons I wanted to play this part.”“Lucky Hank” is based on the novel “Straight Man” by Richard Russo. Co-creators and co-showrunners Paul Lieberstein of “The Office” and Aaron Zellman say the series takes a lot of liberties from the book.“I’ve done a lot of adaptations,” said Zellman. ""You realize an entire chapter of the book may be a moment in a scene. It's just a different animal and you have to invent a lot more stuff.”“Lucky Hank” also comes at a time where Odenkirk is still processing a 2021 massive heart attack on the set of “Better Call Saul."" His heart stopped for 18 minutes and Odenkirk came out of it feeling a mixture of energy and exhaustion, with no real memory of what happened.""Two weeks later he was like, ‘All right, guys, when do we go out and pitch this thing?’ said Zellman.""It's also a sense of, like, ‘You might be making a terrible decision,’ laughed Lieberstein.Odernkik says the heart attack “was as serious as you get before they put you in the ground” and it left him with similar questions about his own life that Hank has.“I’m in it right now. I’m in it right now thinking about, ‘I’m 60. What do I want to do with the rest of my life? How do I want to live?' That’s different from the last 10 years, which, you know, was about Saul Goodman and a lot of getting work done.""He stars opposite Mireille Enos as his wife, Lily, who tends to balance out Hank's cynicism but is also facing her own questions of self-identity and purpose. Enos is best-known for playing dark, serious roles like in “The Killing.”“We had a lunch together in New York when she was considering playing this part,"" recalled Odenkirk. ""At the end I said, ‘You have a great smile. How come I’ve never seen it?’ She goes, ‘They never ask me to do light material.’ She’s always on the run, being chased...,it’s always such intense drama, which she’s amazing in, but she’s got a lightness and a spirit to her that I don’t think she’s had an opportunity to show. It's really on display here as Lily.”",2023/3/18,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839242,Troubled bank stocks drop despite $84bn liquidity boost,"Shares of First Republic Bank and Credit Suisse dove back deep into the red on Friday as concerns of a wider banking crisis in the United States and Europe remained elevated.The US regional lender's perceived value slumped 25% while Switzerland's second-largest bank closed down 8%, despite massive financial lifelines thrown by regulators over the previous 24 hours.Larger US banks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co and Morgan Stanley, stepped in on Thursday to inject $30 billion (€28 billion) into First Republic to prevent it from suffering a run by depositors similar to Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank — two regional lenders that went under last week.The shoring up of First Republic reflected ""funding and liquidity strains on banks, driven by weakening depositor confidence,"" said ratings agency Moody's, which this week downgraded its outlook on the US banking system to negative.In Europe, the Swiss central bank gave Credit Suisse an emergency loan of up to $54 billion, also on Thursday.But many analysts, investors and bankers think the loan facility has only bought Credit Suisse some time to work out what to do next.The US and Swiss moves did initially boost stock markets. However, the selloff resumed Friday and the stock prices of other major banks also fell, with JP Morgan, Citigroup and Bank of America down at least 3% at one point. Many of their European peers ended Friday down around 1.5%.Eswar Prasad, a Cornell University economist, said Credit Suisse has become ""an important bellwether of fragilities in the global banking system"" and if it failed, it could shake confidence in the banking system, causing further central bank intervention.In a sign of falling confidence, Morningstar Direct said the Swiss bank had seen more than $450 million in net outflows from its US and European-managed funds from March 13 to 15.Reuters, meanwhile, cited five unnamed sources as saying that at least four major banks, including Societe Generale SA and Deutsche Bank AG, have put restrictions on their trades involving Credit Suisse Group AG or its securities.Despite the market volatility, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz told business daily Handelsblatt Friday that he doesn't believe that Europe is heading for a crisis.""I don't see that danger,"" Scholz said, adding that deposits are safe. ""We live in a completely different time,"" he told the paper, referring to comparisons with the 2008 financial crisis. Scholz is also a former finance minister.Meanwhile, Reuters reported Friday that supervisors at the European Central Bank (ECB) saw no contagion for eurozone banks from the turmoil.A source told the news agency that members of the Single Supervisory Board were told deposits remained stable across eurozone banks. Exposure to Credit Suisse was said to be immaterial.The meeting — a reaction to rapid developments in the banking sector and market jitters — was the second of its kind this week.Despite the reassurances, investors are betting that banking jitters would rein in the ECB's ability to raise interest rates much further after the central bank hiked by 0.5% on Thursday.Focus now shifts to the US Federal Reserve next week, with traders now seeing a 67% likelihood of a smaller 0.25% increase in interest rates in the world's largest economy.Speculation on when the Fed might start slowing its increases had been ripe for months, but the SVB collapse poured fuel on that fire last week.SVB's demise was largely blamed on the sharp rise in borrowing costs, and concerns that other banks could suffer a similar fate, even sparking speculation that the Fed could cut rates to provide some stability. However, SVB's critics see the fault lying in the bank's own strategic errors, remaining overexposed to low-yield, long-term bonds even as interest rates and inflation were wiping out their returns.Later Friday, SVB Financial — the parent company of Silicon Valley Bank — filed for a court-supervised reorganization under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.The filing sets up a legal battle over the bank's remaining assets between the creditors of the holding company and regulators who are looking to make depositors whole.SVB Financial Group believes it has approximately $2.2 billion of liquidity and has said it has other valuable securities and assets that are being considered for sale.mm/msh (AFP, AP, Reuters)",2023/3/17,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839243,"France: Pension protests, no-confidence motions after decree","Fresh protests erupted in Paris on Friday evening, a day after President Emmanuel Macron and his government passed acontentious pension reform by decree, without a vote in the lower house of parliament, the National Assembly.Several thousand demonstrators gathered in the capital's Place de la Concorde, close to the assembly building, facing up to a line of riot police, with some chanting ""Macron, Resign!""Clashes between authorities and protesters erupted later in the evening. Reuters TV broadcast images of police using tear gas to deal with crowd disorder.Earlier, traffic, garbage collection and university campuses in the city were disrupted, as unions threatened open-ended strikes in response to the pension decree.Elsewhere in the country, striking sanitation workers blocked a waste collection plant that is home to Europe's largest incinerator to underline their determination.A blockade at La Mede biorefinery in southern France prevented fuel deliveries from leaving, operator TotalEnergies said, with the potential to cause gasoline shortages.A union official said earlier that a similar blockade of Total's Normandy refinery would begin his weekend.Local media reported that four out of five high-speed TGV trains would not run this weekend, nor more than half of regional rail services.Leaders of the influential CGT union called on members to leave schools, factories, and other workplaces.The French government had decided at short notice on Thursday afternoon to bypass the National Assembly and implement President Emmanuel Macron's most important reform project without a vote.A special article in the French constitution allows for the measure. Parliament still can overrule it, but only by arranging a no-confidence vote in the government within 24 hours of the decree.The pension reform will, among other things, gradually increase the standard retirement age from 62 to 64. The government feared that the result in the lower house would be too close to predict.Macron's government argues the changes are necessary to keep one of western Europe's most generous retirement systems solvent. He tried and failed to implement similar reforms during his first term, ultimately abandoning his flagship police amid the outbreak of COVID.Hours after the move, several thousand people gathered in central Paris and other French cities. Several cars were torched and some 310 people were arrested, according to Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin.French opposition lawmakers did file separate no-confidence motions against the government on Friday, the leader of an independent parliamentary group said.""The vote on this motion will allow us to get out on top of a deep political crisis,"" said the head of the so-called Liot group Bertrand Pancher, whose motion was co-signed by members of the broad left-wing NUPES coalition.The far-right National Rally (RN) filed a second motion, but that was expected to get less backing. RN lawmaker Laure Lavalette however said her party would vote for ""all"" no-confidence motions filed. ""What counts is scuppering this unfair reform bill,"" she said.The National Assembly is expected to vote on the motions next Monday.But even though Macron lost his absolute majority in the lower house of parliament in last year's election, there was little chance either a motion of no-confidence would pass, unless a surprise alliance is formed by MPs from all opposition quarters, incorporating France's extreme left and extreme right — both powerful parliamentary factions.The leaders of the conservative Les Republicains party have ruled out trying to topple the government; Macron had originally hoped to rely on their support to pass the reforms.If an absolute majority of MPs vote in favor, the reform is defeated and the government must resign. Then President Emmanuel Macron could either try to appoint a new prime minister or call new elections. But if there is no absolute majority for a motion of no-confidence, the pension reform will be approved.The upper house, the Senate, had voted in favor of the reforms several times as France's government tried to barter a bill through the legislature.mm, dh/msh (AFP, dpa, Reuters)",2023/3/17,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839244,Mother: Irvo Otieno was 'brilliant and creative and bright',"Irvo Otieno had realized his passion: making hip-hop. He could write a song in less than five minutes. And he was streaming his music under the moniker “Young Vo,” while working toward starting his own record label.“He had found his thing — you know that feeling when you find your thing?” his mother Caroline Ouko told reporters Thursday. “He would go in his room and shut the door. And he had it — he was brilliant and creative and bright.”But, the mother added, “All I'm left with is his voice.”Ouko remembered her son's life at an hourlong news conference that focused primarily on his death March 6 at a state mental hospital in Virginia.Ouko had just viewed video of Otieno's final minutes as he was being admitted to Central State Hospital south of Richmond, during which she and her attorneys say sheriff's deputies smothered him, pressing him down until his body was “clearly lifeless.” His arms and legs were bound, they said, but he posed no threat to the deputies and hospital employees who've since been charged with second-degree murder.Otieno's biography is now coming to the fore, not for his music, but because of the shockingly inhumane way in which authorities say he was killed. He was yet another Black man to die in police custody in a case that prominent civil-rights attorney Ben Crump, who is also representing Ouko, said harshly echoes the previous deaths of such men as George Floyd. Crump represented Floyd's family and the relatives of other Black men killed under similar circumstances.Otieno, who was 28, came to the U.S. from Kenya at the age of 4 but he “was as American as apple pie,” his mother said.As a child in school, he was the type of guy who would invite a student eating lunch alone to join him, and classmates who needed someone to talk to were drawn to him, she said. He was a leader and a listener, someone who took the time to process what was being said and would then “lean back in,” Ouko said.“He cared that people were treated right,” she said. “That was at the core of his upbringing in our home. He cared that people were treated equally.”She added that Otieno wasn’t afraid to offer different perspectives in conversations, to go the other way “when everybody else is following.”Otieno began dealing with some mental health issues during his last year of high school, his mother said. But she said he also went to college in California, and “had long stretches where you wouldn't even know something was wrong.""There were times, though, when he went “into some kind of distress” and needed to see a doctor, she said. Ouko declined to share her son's diagnosis, saying only that he had gone to a mental health facility before and “came back home.”“That's the question that I'm asking: why he didn't come back home,” she said.Otieno was taken into custody March 3, according to a timeline provided by Henrico County Police, a separate entity from the Henrico County Sheriff's Office.The police department said in a news release that officers encountered Otieno while responding to a report of a possible burglary in suburban Richmond, and that based on his behavior, they put him under an emergency custody order and took him to a local hospital for evaluation.Mark Krudys, one of Ouko's attorneys, said that Otieno was experiencing a mental health crisis at the time. He said a neighbor called police over concerns about him gathering lawn lights from a yard.Otieno’s mother tried to de-escalate the initial response from police officers, with the moment captured on a neighbor's cellphone, Crump said.“Caroline is hugging her child, as if she’s trying to protect him from these people who might not see him like she sees him,” he said.Added Krudys: “She was imploring them (to) treat him appropriately, bring him to a hospital. And he was vacuumed into the criminal justice system, for which there was no care that was provided, that we saw.”While he was at the hospital, police said he “became physically assaultive toward officers, who arrested him” and took him to a local jail managed by the Henrico Sheriff’s Office, where he was charged with several crimes.While Otieno was in jail, he was denied access to needed medications, the family attorneys said. Crump said he was pepper-sprayed, and Krudys said the video showed officers on March 6 charging into his jail cell, which was covered in feces and where he lay naked and handcuffed.The video shows officers carrying an “almost lifeless” Otieno out by his arms and legs “like an animal” to a vehicle to be taken to the state hospital, Crump said.Leon Ochieng, Otieno's older brother, said at Thursday's news conference that his mother can't sleep or eat.“Our hearts are broken,” he said. ""But our spirts are strong. And my brother's spirit is not done.""A distraught Ouko said that, “When they took my baby away ... they took him away from his brother. They took him away from his nieces. They took him away from his friends. And they took him away from a community that cared (for) and loved him.”",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839245,Lawmaker pauses filibuster on agreement to debate trans bill,"A lawmaker who has been holding up the work of the Nebraska Legislature for weeks to protest a bill that would ban gender-affirming therapies for minors has paused her persistent filibuster in a deal that will see lawmakers debate the bill next week.Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh, of Omaha, had been staging a filibuster of every single bill before the legislative body — even ones she supported — since late February to protest the bill. Introduced by a freshman lawmaker and supported by hard-right conservatives, the bill would outlaw gender-affirming therapies such as hormone treatments and gender-affirmation surgery for those 18 and younger.Cavanaugh launched her effort when the bill advanced out of committee, introducing amendment after amendment and spending as much time as Nebraska rules allowed on the microphone to hold bills hostage on the legislative floor. She said she would continue to do so through the end of the 90-day session.“I will burn the session to the ground over this bill,"" Cavanaugh said at the time.By the halfway point of the session Wednesday, not a single bill had passed, and only a handful had advanced from the first of three rounds of debate, thanks to Cavanaugh’s relentless filibustering.But on Thursday, Speaker of the Legislature Sen. John Arch announced that an agreement had been reached to break the filibuster after Cavanaugh approached him seeking a compromise. Cavanaugh agreed to pause her filibustering if Arch agreed to push the trans therapies bill to the front of the queue. Debate on the bill will now start Tuesday when the Legislature reconvenes from a long weekend break.“We both agreed that it would be best to stop talking about the issue on other bills, but rather just debate the bill itself,” Arch said.Cavanaugh had said early in the process that she hoped to keep the bill from making it to the legislative floor for debate. But by Wednesday, she wanted a vote to put on the record of which lawmakers would “legislate hate against children.""The deal is likely a sign that Cavanaugh thinks she has the votes to kill the bill when a vote is taken, expected Thursday. If the bill advances, she will resume filibustering every bill for the remainder of the session, she told several news outlets.The Nebraska bill and another that would ban trans people from using bathrooms and locker rooms or playing on sports teams that don’t align with the gender listed on their birth certificates are among roughly 150 bills targeting transgender people that have been introduced in state legislatures this year. Bans on gender-affirming care for minors have already been enacted this year in some Republican-led states, including South Dakota, Utah and Mississippi. Arkansas and Alabama have bans that were temporarily blocked by federal judges.A sweeping bill in Kentucky that bans gender-affirming care in minors was rushed through the legislative process this week by Republicans and passed Thursday. It is expected to survive a promised veto by the governor.As in those states, conservative lawmakers dominate in Nebraska. But the Nebraska Legislature is unique in a couple of ways: It is officially nonpartisan and a one-chamber body with only 49 lawmakers. Although bills can win approval with a simple majority, it takes 33 votes to overcome a filibuster. The Nebraska Legislature is currently made up of 32 registered Republicans and 17 registered Democrats — just enough for the minority to block bills they don't like if they stick together.LGBTQ advocacy group OutNebraska has put out a call for opponents of the bill to show up en masse at the state Capitol next week, wearing purple, blue, pink and/or white, to fill the chamber’s gallery.Arch issued his own call ahead of next week's debate, noting that passions on both sides will be high.“Colleagues, these issues will challenge us to conduct ourselves with decorum during the remaining days,” he said. ""The public expects nothing less, and we should expect nothing less of each other. Let’s measure our words carefully and demonstrate statesmanship in the days ahead.”",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839246,Sabres sign Northeastern goalie Levi to 3-year contract,"BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) — The Buffalo Sabres signed goalie Devon Levi to a three-year entry level contract Friday, less than a week after the 21-year-old’s junior season ended at Northeastern.Levi won the Mike Richter Award as college hockey’s top goalie last season, and is once again a finalist this year following a season in which he led the nation with a .923 save percentage. He also led Hockey East goalies with 14 wins, six shutouts, a 1.81 goals-against average and a .947 save percentage.Drafted by Florida in 2020, Buffalo acquired him in a trade that sent forward Sam Reinhart to the Panthers in July 2021.Levi is considered the Sabres' goalie of the future at a position that’s been mostly unsettled since Ryan Miller’s era ended with his trade to St. Louis during the 2013-14 season.The Sabres have a three-goalie rotation, which includes Eric Comrie and Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen, who are both signed through the end of next season. Levi’s path opened up when Buffalo traded Erik Portillo to Los Angeles earlier this month and after Michigan's goalie expressed no interest to sign with the team.Northeastern failed to qualify for the NCAA Tournament, its season ending in a 2-1 overtime loss to Providence in the Hockey East quarterfinals.After missing his freshman season due to injury, Levi finished with a 38-22-6 record, and leaves Northeastern holding career school marks with a 1.9 goals-against average and 16 shutouts.Levi is from suburban Montreal and represented Canada at the 2022 Beijing Winter Games in the absence of NHL players. He dressed as a backup for one game, but did not play.In 2021, he was named the world junior championship tournament's top goaltender in helping Canada win a silver medal.___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/18,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839248,Nunge's block seals Xavier's win over Kennesaw St in NCAAs,"GREENSBORO, N.C (AP) — Terrell Burden got a shoulder past his defender and pushed into the paint, locking in on the rim for a chance to move Kennesaw State within reach of its first-ever NCAA Tournament win.Instead, Xavier's Jack Nunge descended on him to make the play that capped the Musketeers' late defensive surge — and saved their season.Nunge blocked Burden's driving attempt at a go-ahead layup in the final seconds, and Xavier dug out of a 13-point hole against surprising Kennesaw State to escape with a 72-67 victory in Friday's first round.The 7-footer's block was part of the reason the Owls shot 2-for-15 over the final 9 1/2 minutes, reversing the momentum in a game that had often left third-seeded Xavier (26-9) looking befuddled.“We didn't really change much, and that's oftentimes the story,"" said coach Sean Miller, back for his second stint with the Musketeers. “We just did what we do better.”Souley Boum hit four clinching free throws in the final 2.6 seconds for the Musketeers, who ran off 15 unanswered points as part of a game-ending 24-6 run. That was enough to turn away the 14th-seeded Owls (26-9) in the program's first-ever March Madness game.Xavier moves on to face 11th-seeded Pittsburgh on Sunday in the Midwest Region.Xavier led 68-67 when Burden — who'd been successful all day with dribble penetration — made his move into the paint. But Nunge rotated over and swatted the ball into the backboard.“In the timeout, we were supposed to switch everything,” Nunge said, adding: “He's a really good driver at getting to the rim and I just came over and blocked it.”Burden said everything with the play ran as designed until Nunge's arrival.“It was a great play by him to meet me at the rim,” Burden said.The ball eventually made its way to Boum, who hit two free throws with 2.6 seconds left for a 70-67 lead. The Owls had a chance to set up a 3-pointer for the tie, but that desperate play ended when Spencer Rodgers' right foot landed on the sideline as he caught the inbound pass.Jerome Hunter scored a career-best 24 points to lead the Musketeers, while Boum had 17. Nunge had 10 points, 11 rebounds, two steals and two blocks.Burden and Chris Youngblood each scored 14 points to lead Kennesaw State, which appeared on the verge of a signature March moment, playing with an aggressive edge while backed by vocal pockets of fans. At one point, the 5-10 Burden got Nunge on a switch, pulled him outside and blew past him for a layup and a 61-48 lead.But that's when Xavier started its desperate push back — and Nunge was ready when Burden challenged him again.“We did some things early on both ends of the court that helped build that 13-point lead,” Kennesaw State coach Amir Abdur-Rahim said. “But if anybody in that building thought that was going to be how the game stayed, you hadn't watched much basketball in March — and you probably haven't watched much basketball in general.”BIG PICTUREKennesaw State: The Owls earned their first bid with a rapid climb, improving from a 1-28 season in Abdur-Rahim’s first year. And before this year, the dual-campus Georgia school with nearly 43,000 students had never had a winning record in its Division I era, which began in the 2005-06 season. It was a memorable season that came oh-so-close to adding a historic win.Xavier: Five years ago, the Musketeers had won 29 games and reached the NCAA Tournament for the 15th time in 17 seasons, a stretch that began under Miller. But they hadn't made it since. Miller returned this season for his second stint at Xavier after 12 years at Arizona and immediately ended that five-year drought. It's also his first trip to the NCAAs since 2018 with the Wildcats.ALL GOODBoum and teammate Adam Kunkel traded words on the court — with Boum giving Kunkel a bump — leading into a late timeout. They continued jawing across the bench until teammates stepped in.Boum and Kunkel both shrugged it off, with Kunkel calling it “just the heat of the game.”“We've got to be on point with stuff, and if we get a little emotional, it's nothing personal,” Boum said, adding they “hugged it out.”WARM FAREWELLAfter the game, Abdur-Rahim gathered his team for a moment at midcourt before the Owls headed for the locker room while waving to their boisterous fans.“I am so proud of this group: who they've become, what they're about, but more importantly, how they respond to adversity, and even how they respond to success,"" he said during his news conference, which at one point had him fighting back tears.""That was a fun basketball game out there today, man.

It published a photo of the alleged knife on the ground.It was the latest bloodshed in the current round of violence, one of the worst between Israelis and Palestinians in years.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839254,State says Louisiana family must give up beloved pet nutria,"NEW ORLEANS (AP) — A Louisiana couple has run afoul of state law by keeping a 22-pound nutria -- a beady-eyed, orange-toothed, rat-tailed rodent commonly considered a wetlands-damaging pest -- as a pet that frolics with their dog, snuggles in their arms and swims in the family pool.Denny and Myra Lacoste tell New Orleans news outlets they are devastated at the potential loss of “Neuty,"" a pet they say they raised from infancy when its siblings were killed in traffic. The move by state Wildlife and Fisheries officials, who say it's illegal to keep an orphaned or injured wild animal as a pet, has sparked a petition drive by those who want him to stay with the humans who raised him.The state Wildlife Department says the plan is to house Neuty at the Baton Rouge Zoo. But it's unclear when that will happen. A statement from the department Friday said officials had gone to remove the pet from the Lacoste's New Orleans-area residence Thursday.“The nutria was not at the residence when agents arrived,” the department said. “The matter is still ongoing.”Nutria were introduced into North America more than a century ago, and they are considered a nuisance invasive species in Louisiana. Their appetite for wetlands vegetation and their burrowing into levees hinder flood control, harm agriculture and contribute to coastal wetlands loss. At various times public officials have put bounties on them and encouraged hunting of them for their pelts and even for food.They are sometimes derided as “nutria rats.” Yet they have also become such a familiar part of Louisiana landscape and lore that a New Orleans minor league baseball team once employed actors in costume as larger-than life caricatures of the creatures as mascots — Boudreaux and Clotilde.Neuty was tiny when Denny Lacoste, who runs a family seafood restaurant, rescued him from a road near a canal more than two years ago. Lacoste told New Orleans news outlets that the infant animal's siblings had been killed by traffic.Now, the animal is a social media star, featured in TikTok videos and seen in a New Orleans Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate video being held lovingly by Denny Lacoste, scampering across a floor with a towel and chomping down on a raw crawfish. Lacoste told the newspaper that Neuty even likes to ride in the car with his head out the window.The Baton Rouge Zoo said it was ready to give Neuty a home in an area with another male nutria. “In most cases the animal would have been placed back into the wild. However, LDWF biologists and Zoo officials said that since the animal has been habituated to humans, it would not be able to survive in the wild,” the wildlife department said.",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839255,UConn women still adjusting rotation ahead of March Madness,"STORRS, Conn. (AP) — Most coaches know their team's identity and have a rotation set by the time the NCAA Tournament rolls around.But for Geno Auriemma and second-seeded UConn (29-5), there are still a lot of questions, because two former starters only recently returned to help the Huskies begin a run at a 12th national title and a 15th straight Final Four.Guard Azzi Fudd was out for 22 games this season with two knee injuries, before returning for the Big East Tournament. Wing Caroline Ducharme came back in mid-February after sitting out 13 games in concussion protocol. Neither has yet to play her way back into pre-injury form.But with both Fudd and Ducharme back, the Huskies cruised through the conference tournament. They won their three games by an average of 20 points, after going 7-3 to end the regular season, with each game decided by 10 points or fewer.Fudd, who had been averaging just under 18 points a game before she was hurt, averaged just 8.3 points over the three tournament games and Ducharme scored a total of four points.Both are expected to play significant minutes Saturday when the second-seeded Huskies open their NCAA Tournament against No. 15 seed Vermont (25-6), the America East champions. The winner faces either No. 7 seed Baylor (19-12) or No. 10 seed Alabama (20-10) on Monday night.“It does change how you go about your rotation; it does change the number of minutes that people play and and it can have an effect on the chemistry and fluidity,” Auriemma said. “But it’s a good problem to have right? It’s better than the other alternative. The bottom line is we got better and that can only help.”Just two players — Aaliyah Edwards and Lou Lopez Senechal — have been healthy enough to play all season for UConn, which had to postpone a game earlier this season because of a lack of healthy bodies.The Huskies have 10 players available, but are still shorthanded. They have been without former national player of the year Paige Bueckers and incoming freshman Ice Brady all season; both suffered serious knee injuries before the campaign began.Auriemma even missed time with an illness and while grieving the death of his mother. Associate head coach Chris Dailey missed a game after collapsing on the court during the national anthem.UConn hopes that like last year, when Bueckers returned from a knee injury just before the postseason, the return of Ducharme and Fudd can help propel the Huskies back into title contention.“Throughout the whole year, we were used to facing different situations,” Senechal said. “I think that we adjusted really well, towards the Big East Tournament. And I think now our mentality is just to have the same mindset that we had during that Big East Tournament and bring it to the NCAA Tournament.”Forward Aubrey Griffin, who had back surgery last year, left the Big East title game against Villanova with spasms, but was running up and down the court Friday in practice with no apparent ill effects.Vermont coach Alisa Kresge said she isn't worried about who may or may not be playing for Connecticut. But she did allow her players, many of whom grew up as fans of UConn, to spend part of Friday staring at the banners and names hanging in Gampel Pavilion and celebrate where they were about to take the court.“Take that in for a second, but then when the tip goes off, we've got to go to work,"" she said.Baylor, which is playing in its 19th straight NCAA Tournament, finds itself in an unfamiliar position. After losing their last two games and six of their final nine, the Bears are traveling to another school's home court for the first two rounds for the first time since 2012.Forward Caitlin Bickle said that's not necessarily a bad thing.“Getting to play on the road, I think everything is so much more exciting, the atmosphere so much more exciting within March Madness,” she said.This is Alabama's second trip to the NCAA Tournament in the last three years.Both teams have faced tough competition this season. Baylor has played 11 ranked teams, going 5-6 in those games. The Crimson Tide have played 12 games against current NCAA Tournament teams, going 6-6 in those contests.“We're very similar in the adversity we've had,” Alabama coach Kristy Curry said. “It's a brand new season and it will be interesting to see whose will is a little bit stronger than the other one's.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839256,Dems say some foreign gifts to Trump remain unaccounted for,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Donald Trump's White House has failed to report more than 100 gifts from foreign nations worth more than a quarter-million dollars, and federal officials have been unable to find a life-size painting of Trump given by the president of El Salvador as well as golf clubs from the prime minister of Japan, according to a report Friday from House Democrats.Among the unreported items are 16 gifts from Saudi Arabia worth more than $45,000 in all, including a dagger valued at up to $24,000, and 17 presents from India that include expensive cufflinks, a vase and a $4,600 model of the Taj Mahal, says the report from Democrats on the House Oversight Committee.Gifts above several hundred dollars that foreign officials give to the president, vice president and their families are required under the Foreign Gifts and Decorations Act to be reported to the State Department. The report from House Democrats, citing State Department records, says the number of gifts reported by Trump and his family are lower than the number disclosed by previous presidents.All told, the report says, though the White House did report some gifts to State between 2017 and 2019, it failed to report more than 100 foreign gifts with a total value of over $250,000.The report says federal officials have not been able to locate a life-size painting of Trump that, according to internal White House correspondence, was commissioned by the president of El Salvador and delivered to the U.S. Embassy in El Salvador as a gift to Trump just before the 2020 U.S. election. According to the report, the U.S. ambassador to El Salvador alerted U.S. officials to the gift and requested help in shipping it.The report says that ""there are no records of the painting's disposition"" by the National Archives and Records Administration or the General Services Administration but that some records suggest it may have been moved to Florida in July 2021 as property of Trump's.Also unaccounted for are thousands of dollars in golf clubs given to Trump in 2017 and 2018 by Shinzo Abe, then the prime minister of Japan. The clubs, which the report says “included a putter valued at $460 and a driver valued at $3,040,” were given by Abe to Trump during visits to the Trump International Golf Club and Kasumigaseki Country Club. The report says NARA does not have records of the clubs, and GSA has no records of the clubs being purchased.""Today’s preliminary findings suggest again the Trump Administration’s brazen disregard for the rule of law and its systematic mishandling of large gifts from foreign governments, including many lavish personalized gifts that vastly exceed the statutory limit in value but were never reported — some that are still missing today,"" Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, top Democrat on the Oversight Committee, said in a statement.He also said that the committee would “remain committed to following the facts to determine the extent to which former President Trump broke the law or violated the Constitution when he failed to report gifts and took possession of valuable items without paying the fair market price for them.”A Trump spokesman did not immediately return an email seeking comment.___More on Donald Trump-related investigations: https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839257,3 police dead in Mexico City shootout with cartel gunmen,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — Three police officers and one suspect were killed and seven suspected drug cartel members were arrested Friday following a dramatic running gun battle on the eastern edge of Mexico City.It was a glimpse into drug cartel violence that the nation’s capital rarely sees, but which has become frequent in northern and western parts of the country.Police said two officers were killed in a town just east of the capital early Friday when they approached a house where a kidnap and murder gang were believed to be hiding, according to police in the State of Mexico, which borders the capital. They said the suspects also were being sought for murders.Four kidnap victims were found in the house before the gunfire erupted. The initial gunfight occurred near the town of San Antonio La Isla, about 35 miles (50 kilometers) east of the capital.The suspects then fled in a vehicle into Mexico City, and continued shooting at pursuing officers, killing one capital police officer. The suspects then crashed their car against a lamp post. Some were injured in the crash, and some fled on foot but were taken into custody.Those arrested included one woman. Weapons found at the crime scene included a number of high-powered rifles.City police chief Omar Garcia Harfuch said the suspects apparently worked for the hyper-violent Jalisco cartel. “They say they belong to a group in Jalisco,” Garcia Harfuch said. “They were carrying insignias linked to the Jalisco cartel.”He said the suspects were trying to reach a safehouse the gang apparently operated in Mexico City.Mexico City officials have long acknowledged that the country's major drug cartels have some presence in the capital. But they have claimed the sheer size of the Mexico City police force — some 90,000 officers by some counts — and terrible traffic jams have prevented cartel gunmen from operating openly in the city as they do elsewhere.Garcia Harfuch was himself targeted by the Jalisco cartel in a 2020 attack on a street in Mexico City.In the 2020 attack, some two dozen gunmen ambushed García Harfuch’s armored vehicle before dawn on one of the capital’s main boulevards. The brazen attack left him with three bullet wounds and his two bodyguards and a bystander dead.Prominent Mexican journalist Ciro Gómez Leyva escaped shaken but unharmed from an attack last December, when two gunmen on a motorcycle tried to kill him in a late-night attack on a Mexico City street. He was saved because his SUV had bullet-proofing.In raids and searches that led to the detentions of 11 suspects, police found a cap with the letters CJNG, the initials of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel.",2023/3/18,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839259,Lady Vols' Jordan Horston healthy for this March Madness,"KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Tennessee senior guard Jordan Horston has not decided yet whether she'll put her name into WNBA draft after this NCAA Tournament or return for another season on Rocky Top.What wound up being a season-ending injury sidelined her for last year's NCAA Tournament and Tennessee's first Sweet 16 berth since 2016. So Horston is soaking up this opportunity, starting Saturday when the fourth-seeded Lady Vols (23-11) begin by hosting No. 13 seed Saint Louis in the first round.“It feels really good,” Horston said Friday. “It was really hard for me being injured and just having to watch the game instead of playing. I am really excited to be able to play the big game of basketball again. So I’m taking advantage of every opportunity that I am given.”Fellow senior Rickea Jackson, who announced Monday she's coming back next season, has been lobbying Horston to join her. For now, the Lady Vols' leading scorer can't wait for her own NCAA debut after missing out at Mississippi State the last three seasons.“I’m very excited for this and how far this team can go and the potential that we have to continue to keep playing great and build our chemistry,” Jackson said.The 24th-ranked Lady Vols are hosting a second consecutive year thanks to the nation's toughest schedule. Also in Knoxville is No. 17 Iowa State, the fifth seed in the Seattle 3 region. Cyclones coach Bill Fennelly plays his old team in 12th-seeded Toledo (28-4) for a spot in Monday night's second round.Tennessee coach Kellie Harper has a much healthier team than a year ago, even with center Tamari Key sidelined by blood clots. Harper said Horston makes so many plays that don't show up on the stat sheet.“I blocked it from my memory that she didn’t play last year,” Harper said of Horston. “Obviously, having her out there, I mean, she’s just a talented player. You want her on the court with you.”The Lady Vols will try to move to 25-0 in first-round NCAA games here against a program making its tournament debut as the Atlantic 10 Tournament champs.The Saint Louis Billikens (17-17) are soaking in women's basketball history, posing for photos with the statue of the late Pat Summitt and touring the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame on Friday along with Toledo.Saint Louis coach Rebecca Tillett led Longwood to the tournament a year ago as the Big South Tournament champs. She brought guard Kyla McMakin with her, so they're trying to share their experience. The Billikens feel confident having won six straight and 11 of their last 12.“This is a historical place,” McMakin said of the arena filled with Tennessee's eight national championship banners. “Why not come out and make history?""Iowa State (22-9) had its own argument to host in Ames as the Big 12 Tournament champ. They've won four straight, including knocking off a trio of NCAA teams by double digits for their first league tourney title since 2001.Fennelly, who had been texting with Toledo coach Tricia Cullop, said he didn't want to play his old friends and the program he took to three NCAA berths between 1988 and 1995.“Of all the teams that could pop up, that’s the one that did ..."" Fennelly said. “I’m sure the committee has a slight sense of humor. But no, I wasn’t excited about it.”STREAKING ROCKETSToledo has matched the program record by winning 16 straight, including an upset of then-No. 14 Michigan at Ann Arbor in December. This is the Rockets' ninth tournament berth and first since 2017. They are looking for their first win since beating Ole Miss in 1996.LOCAL TIESThe regional is a homecoming for two Cyclones.Freshman Denae Fritz is from Maryville, a short drive from Knoxville, and was a 2021 Tennessee Miss Basketball.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839260,Quadruple murder trial begins for former NY police officer,"NEW YORK (AP) — A federal jury in New York began hearing testimony in the murder trial of a former New York police officer accused of masterminding the killing of four people — one strangled to death with a zip tie and three others shot execution-style — over money in a drug operation.All four men were found buried on the property of the former suburban New York police officer, Nicholas Tartaglione, whose trial, which began Thursday, is expected to last a month in U.S. District Court in White Plains.But defense attorneys asserted that Tartaglione had nothing to do with the killings and was being used by the government as a convenient fall guy.Tartaglione gained further notoriety as a former cellmate of Jeffrey Epstein, before the disgraced financier committed suicide in a Manhattan jail cell in August 2019 while awaiting sex-trafficking charges.Prosecutors contend that Tartaglione lured one of the victims, Martin Luna, to a bar because he believed Luna had stolen money intended for the purchase of cocaine.The government says the three other victims — a friend and two of Luna's nephews who had nothing to do with the drug operation — accompanied Luna to the bar. Luna was strangled with a zip tie then taken to the defendant's ranch in Otisville, about 70 miles (113 kilometers) north of Manhattan.The three other men were alive and bound when Tartaglione's associates drove them to the same property, where they were shot in the back of the head. Prosecutors accuse Tartaglione of shooting one of the victims.Investigators dug up the bodies in December 2016, about eight months after they were killed and buried.Three of Tartaglione's associates are expected to testify on behalf of the government, who defense attorneys contend are doing so to gain favor with U.S. prosecutors in their own cases. A fourth associate — also a former police officer — killed himself.Tartaglione retired from the Briarcliff Manor Police Department in 2008 after suffering an injury five years earlier.",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839261,Q&A: K-pop star KANGDANIEL is on the pursuit of happiness,"New York (AP) — KANGDANIEL is one of K-pop’s brightest stars, but at just 26 years old, he’s already learned there’s more to life than bright lights and fancy restaurants.“I like to pursue happiness because in the end, time is not eternal … we have to maximize our happiness and it’s almost imprinted in my brain,” explained the “Paranoia” and “Nirvana” singer. “There are times when I had to do something that I didn’t want to and I didn’t have no money, and there was no outcome that I expected. I was shocked because money didn’t give me happiness.”KANGDANIEL, chosen by Forbes Korea as one of its top 40 celebrities for 2022, is wrapping up his first North American tour, with the final stop in Los Angeles on Saturday.KANGDANIEL'S path to superstardom began in 2017 after winning the second season of the reality TV talent series “Produce 101,” which led to the formation of the K-pop boy band Wanna One. He went solo two years later. He released his debut album, “The Story,” last year.KANGDANIEL, who publicly struggled with depression and panic disorder in 2019, says the pursuit of happiness is not a fanciful wish but a way of life.“A lot of people say, ‘Oh, without money you are not happy.’ For me, those two things are separate,” said KANGDANIEL, who grew up listening to an eclectic mix of Green Day, Nirvana, Michael Jackson and Usher. “That’s why I pursue happiness above everything.”In an interview, the avid “Star Wars” fan talked about reaching the American audience, pursuing film roles, and the pressures of fame.Remarks have been edited for brevity and clarity.___AP: This is your first tour in the U.S. K-pop is so huge all over the world. Does crossing over to American fans matter?KANGDANIEL: K-pop fans are all over the world but America is very special because of the Billboard chart. It has a long history, and everyone in the world has heard of it before. It’s really well known and to be included in the chart, it would be my honor. And I believe the American audience has good ears for good music. So, if I have more fans in the U.S., they would give me more motivation to work harder.AP: You’re considered as one of South Korea’s most influential celebrities. What does that mean to you?KANGDANIEL: One thing I felt for sure, even if I want it or not, I think I have more responsibility.South Korea is my home country and there are many stars from the country … it’s a responsibility because they recognize me as one of the celebrities. So, everything I do, and all the music I make, I feel like I have to do more and be more creative.AP: Would you ever reunite with Wanna One, even if it was just for one special project or song?KANGDANIEL: It’s not something I can just (plan) overnight. But of course, I’m very open to it. So, if there’s a good chance, I’d probably do it. And a little (while) ago, there was an awards ceremony. We performed together as a group, and I really enjoyed it. It was so much fun, and I was able to learn a lot.AP: You recently made your acting debut in the Disney+ series “Rookie Cops.” How was your experience as an actor?KANGDANIEL: It was really fun … it was a little bit different from what I expected, but then the learning process was very interesting and I enjoyed it.I love working on a TV series, but next time, if there is an opportunity, I’d like to make a film because I’ve always loved films. So yup, next time, if there’s a chance (to film a movie), I’d like to do it.AP: What was different about filming the TV show than you expected?KANGDANIEL: The schedule! (laughs)AP: K-pop is a global phenomenon and most of the artists are very young. How have you personally dealt with the fame?KANGDANIEL: We can say it is true that K-pop stars are relatively young compared to other artists in different scenes and different countries … but honestly speaking, age doesn’t really define the artist. It doesn’t really make a difference because in Korea, we say there is no age (limit) when learning things in education.I don’t really enjoy doing a lot of social media accounts, although I have one, and I don’t look at my phone for hours … I want to communicate and get inspired by others, but not too much information — just right amount because I want to understand on my own, rather than comparing myself with others.___Follow Associated Press entertainment journalist Gary Gerard Hamilton at: @GaryGHamilton on all his social media platforms.",2023/3/18,,World

The Gauchos were held to 30.4% shooting in the second half and the Bears pulled away.Miles Norris led the Gauchos with 15 points.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839263,Family seeks jailer punishments after beaten inmate's death,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — The parents of a Black man who was having a psychotic episode and died in custody last fall after Memphis jailers punched, kicked and kneeled on his back during a confrontation are seeking answers for their son and punishments against the jail staff.At a news conference in Memphis on Friday, 33-year-old Gershun Freeman's mother said her son had “a lot of dreams, a lot of admiration” and cared for people. Kimberly Freeman said she wants justice for her son and wants to know who the jailers are.“They have blood on their hand,” Kimberly Freeman said. ""They go home every night to their family. Whereas for me and my granddaughter, we have to see my son, her father, in a box.”Gershun Freeman's father, George Burks, added that he wants to see the officers ""punished, brought to justice.”The Nashville District Attorney’s Office released video earlier this month of Freeman at the Shelby County Jail in Memphis.The video shows Freeman was beaten by at least 10 corrections officers Oct. 5 after he ran naked from his cell. His attorneys say he was also struck with handcuffs, rings of jail keys and pepper spray cannisters.Freeman had “psychosis and cardiovascular disease and died of a heart attack while being restrained,” Shelby County Sheriff Floyd Bonner said in a statement earlier this month, citing the medical examiner’s report.Prominent civil rights lawyer Ben Crump, who is representing Freeman’s family, deemed the case “another video of an unarmed Black man being killed by law enforcement here in Shelby County, Tennessee.”The city has been roiled by Tyre Nichols’ fatal beating by Memphis police in January. The Black motorist was punched, hit with a baton, kicked, and pepper sprayed during an arrest that was recorded on video. His death led to seven police firings, including of the five officers who have since been charged with second-degree murder, plus three fire department firings. Crump is also representing Nichols’ family. Members of Nichols' family were on hand for Thursday's news conference, as well.“I don’t know what is happening in America where law enforcement feels that they can treat mental health issues like criminal issues, especially if they are marginalized people of color, especially if they are Black men,” Crump said.Freeman’s manner of death is listed as a homicide in the autopsy report from the West Tennessee Regional Forensic Center, although the report says this “is not meant to definitively indicate criminal intent.”In his statement, the Shelby County sheriff said it was unfortunate the video does not show the whole episode. The video has been edited and includes multiple camera angles in different parts of the jail.The district attorney’s office for Shelby County has brought in the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation to look into the death. It has asked the Nashville District Attorney General’s Office to act as an independent prosecutor in the case.The sheriff has said he will “wait for additional information from the TBI and the investigating D.A. before taking further administrative action.”Freeman was booked in jail Oct. 1 on charges of attacking and kidnapping his girlfriend, according to court records.The video begins with two corrections officers serving meals to inmates in a narrow hallway. When Freeman’s cell opens, he runs out unclothed and appears to charge at the officers.The officers wrestle him to the ground and begin to punch, kick and pepper spray him. They are joined by additional officers. The deputies move with Freeman out of the hallway. From another camera’s view, we see Freeman wrapping himself around an officer’s legs in a different hallway.The video shifts to a bank of escalators and Freeman, still naked, runs up one of them. In another hallway, a struggle continues with officers attempting to restrain him before getting him face-down on the ground. They can be seen stepping and kneeling on his back before he becomes still. One officer remained on Freeman’s back for several minutes before he was lifted.He appears limp when officers do lift him up, with his head falling forward between his knees and his hands cuffed behind his back. He remains in that position until medical employees arrive, and the video ends.",2023/3/18,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839278,"Lance Reddick, 'The Wire' and 'John Wick' star, dies at 60","NEW YORK (AP) — Lance Reddick, a character actor who specialized in intense, icy and possibly sinister authority figures on TV and film, including “The Wire,” ""Fringe” and the ""John Wick” franchise, has died. He was 60.Reddick died “suddenly” Friday morning, his publicist Mia Hansen said in a statement, attributing his death to natural causes. No further details were provided.Wendell Pierce, Reddick’s co-star on “The Wire” paid tribute on Twitter. “A man of great strength and grace,” he wrote. “As talented a musician as he was an actor. The epitome of class."" “John Wick — Chapter Four” director Chad Stahelski and star Keanu Reeves said they were dedicating the upcoming film to Reddick and were “deeply saddened and heartbroken at the loss.”Reddick was often put in a suit or a crisp uniform during his career, playing tall, taciturn and elegant men of distinction. He was best known for his role as straight-laced Lt. Cedric Daniels on the hit HBO series “The Wire,” where his character was agonizingly trapped in the messy politics of the Baltimore police department.“The Wire” creator David Simon praised Reddick on Twitter: “Consummate professional, devoted collaborator, lovely and gentle man, loyal friend. Could go on, but no, I can’t go on. This is gutting. And way, way, way too soon.”“I’m an artist at heart. I feel that I’m very good at what I do. When I went to drama school, I knew I was at least as talented as other students, but because I was a Black man and I wasn’t pretty, I knew I would have to work my butt off to be the best that I would be, and to be noticed,” Reddick told the Los Angeles Times in 2009.Reddick also starred on the Fox series “Fringe” as a special agent Phillip Broyles, the smartly-dressed Matthew Abaddon on “Lost” and played the multi-skilled Continental Hotel concierge Charon in Lionsgate's “John Wick” movies, including the fourth in the series that releases later this month.“The world of Wick would not be what it is without Lance Reddick and the unparalleled depth he brought to Charon’s humanity and unflappable charisma. Lance leaves behind an indelible legacy and hugely impressive body of work, but we will remember him as our lovely, joyful friend and Concierge,” Lionsgate said in a statement.Reddick earned a SAG Award nomination in 2021 as part of the ensemble for Regina King’s film “One Night in Miami.” He played recurring roles on “Intelligence” and “American Horror Story” and was on the show “Bosch” for its seven-year run.His upcoming projects include 20th Century’s remake of “White Men Can’t Jump” and “Shirley,” Netflix’s biopic of former Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm. He was also slated to appear in the “John Wick” spinoff “Ballerina,” as well as “The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial.”The Baltimore-born-and-raised Reddick was a Yale University drama school graduate who enjoyed some success after school by landing guest or recurring roles “CSI: Miami” and “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.” He also appeared in several movies, including “I Dreamed of Africa,” “The Siege” and “Great Expectations.”It was on season four of “Oz,” playing a doomed undercover officer sent to prison who becomes an addict, that Reddick had a career breakthrough.“I was never interested in television. I always saw it as a means to an end. Like so many actors, I was only interested in doing theater and film. But ‘Oz’ changed television. It was the beginning of HBO’s reign on quality, edgy, artistic stuff. Stuff that harkens back to great cinema of the ’60s and ’70s,” he told The Associated Press in 2011.“When the opportunity for ‘Oz’ came up, I jumped. And when I read the pilot for ‘The Wire,’ as a guy that never wanted to be on television, I realized I had to be on this show.”Reddick attended the prestigious Eastman School of Music, where he studied classical composition, and he played piano. His first album, the jazzy “Contemplations and Remembrances,” came out in 2011.He had a recurring role as Jeffrey Tetazoo, director of the Central Intelligence Agency, on the CBS series “Intelligence.” On “American Horror Story: Coven,” he portrayed Papa Legba, the go-between between humanity and the spirit world.Reddick is survived by his wife, Stephanie Reddick, and children, Yvonne Nicole Reddick and Christopher Reddick.His death was first reported by celebrity website TMZ.com.___Mark Kennedy is at http://twitter.com/KennedyTwits",2023/3/18,,World

(AP) — Kansas Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly vetoes bill on transgender athletes, sets up fight with GOP on legislative override.",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839280,Veto of Kansas bill on trans athletes sets up override fight,"TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) — A Kansas bill banning transgender athletes from girls' and women's sports was vetoed by Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly for the third year in a row Friday, setting up a hotly contested fight in the Republican-controlled Legislature to override her.Kelly's action was expected because of her two previous vetoes. Kansas Republicans made Kelly's vetoes a major issue in multiple television attack ads when she ran for reelection last year, winning narrowly.The governor said in her veto message that the bill would harm students' mental health and hurt the state's efforts to recruit businesses. Kelly also said lawmakers should leave the issue to the state association set up decades ago to run student activities in middle and high schools.“Let's be clear what this bill is all about — politics,” Kelly wrote. “It won’t increase any test scores. It won’t help any kids read or write. It won’t help any teachers prepare our kids for the real world.”Kelly's arguments Friday were similar to those she made in past veto messages and during her reelection campaign.“It would send a signal to prospective companies that Kansas is more focused on unnecessary and divisive legislation than becoming a place where young people want to work and raise a family,” her message Friday said.Republicans have more than the two-thirds majorities in both chambers needed to override a veto, but in 2021 and 2022, a few GOP moderates voted against overriding Kelly. The House and Senate votes on this year's bill suggest supporters could have just enough votes to prevail.The measure would apply to girls' and women's K-12, club and college sports. If supporters can override Kelly's veto, Kansas would join 18 other states with such a law, including Iowa, Oklahoma and Texas.The measure is among dozens of Republican proposals pushing back against transgender rights in statehouses across the U.S. Kansas has bills aimed at banning gender-affirming care for minors and preventing transgender men and women from using bathrooms, locker rooms and other facilities associated with their gender identities.Kelly's veto came a day after Kentucky's Republican-dominated legislature approved a ban on gender-affirming care for minors and Iowa’s GOP-controlled Legislature approved a bill on school bathrooms.In defending the legislation, Kansas House Speaker Dan Hawkins, a Wichita Republican, recently posted tweets endorsing a theory debunked by multiple studies that a “social contagion” has led to more people identifying as transgender.He and other Republicans also have argued that banning transgender athletes will preserve fair competition and opportunities for girls and young women.“This is common sense,” Hawkins said in a statement Friday.Kansas officials and LGBTQ-rights advocates say only a handful of young transgender people participate in high school activities — and possibly only one transgender Kansas girl is on a sports team. Backers of the bill argue that the state should act before transgender athletes become more prevalent.During her reelection campaign, Kelly aired a television ad that featured her looking into the camera and saying, “Of course, men should not play girls’ sports. OK, we all agree there.”LGBTQ-rights advocates understood the ad as saying men aren't playing women’s sports because transgender women are women. But Republicans said she was lying about her record, and they’ve repeatedly mentioned her statement since.“It’s clear that candidate Kelly is gone and Gov. Kelly has returned,"" Hawkins said. “Now that she no longer has to face the voters, the governor has done another about face.”The vote last week in the Senate was 28-11, giving backers one more than the two-thirds needed in the 40-member chamber to override a veto.However, the House would vote first, and the vote there last month was 82-40. While supporters need 84 of 125 votes to override a veto, two Republicans who backed the bill were absent.Last year, supporters were short of a two-thirds House majority, but in last year's elections, three Republicans who supported a ban replaced GOP lawmakers who'd voted against overriding Kelly's veto. Also, while no Democrats voted last year to override Kelly, freshman Democratic Rep. Ford Carr, of Wichita, voted for this year's bill.Republican lawmakers in Kansas also have pursued a bill to revoke the state medical licenses of doctors providing puberty-blocking drugs, hormone therapy or surgery for transgender minors. It passed the Senate last month, but the House hasn't had a committee hearing.Another Senate-passed bill would define male and female in Kansas law based on a person's anatomy at birth and declare that cisgender women and girls have a right to private spaces separate from men, such as bathrooms and locker rooms.LGBTQ-rights advocates have said the measure not only bars transgender people from facilities associated with their gender identities but also erases them legally, along with gender-nonconforming and nonbinary people.The bill's language also would prevent transgender people from changing birth certificates and driver's licenses to reflect their gender identities, though Kansas is under a 2019 federal court order to allow birth certificate changes.The measure is before the House after one of its committees rewrote it this week to prevent it from applying to intersex people. Intersex describes people born with genitalia, chromosomes or reproductive organs not associated with typical definitions for males or females.“We don't want to marginalize them anymore,” said Republican state Rep. Ron Bryce, a southeast Kansas doctor.____Follow John Hanna on Twitter: https://twitter.com/apjdhanna",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839281,Officials are preparing security in case of Trump indictment,"NEW YORK (AP) — Law enforcement officials in New York are making security preparations for the possibility that former President Donald Trump could be indicted in the coming weeks and appear in a Manhattan courtroom in an investigation examining hush money paid to women who alleged sexual encounters with him, four law enforcement officials said Friday.There has been no public announcement of any timeframe for the grand jury's secret work, including any potential vote on whether to indict the ex-president.The law enforcement officials, who were not authorized to speak publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity, said authorities are just preparing in case of an indictment. They described the conversations as preliminary and are considering security, planning and the practicalities of a potential court appearance by a former president.Trump’s lawyer, Joseph Tacopina, told The Associated Press that if Trump is indicted, “we will follow the normal procedures.”The Manhattan district attorney's office had no comment. A message was left for court administrators.The grand jury has been hearing from witnesses including former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, who says he orchestrated payments in 2016 to two women to silence them about sexual encounters they said they had with Trump a decade earlier.Trump denies the encounters occurred, says he did nothing wrong and has cast the investigation as a “witch hunt” by a Democratic prosecutor bent on sabotaging the Republican's 2024 presidential campaign.“Democrats have investigated and attacked President Trump since before he was elected — and they’ve failed every time,” campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung said in a statement Thursday about the inquiry.Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office has apparently been examining whether any state laws were broken in connection with the payments or the way Trump’s company compensated Cohen for his work to keep the women’s allegations quiet.Daniels and at least two former Trump aides — onetime political adviser Kellyanne Conway and former spokesperson Hope Hicks — are among witnesses who have met with prosecutors in recent weeks.Cohen has said that at Trump's direction, he arranged payments totaling $280,000 to porn actor Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal. According to Cohen, the payouts were to buy their silence about Trump, who was then in the thick of his first presidential campaign.Cohen and federal prosecutors said the company paid him $420,000 to reimburse him for the $130,000 payment to Daniels and to cover bonuses and other supposed expenses. The company classified those payments internally as legal expenses.The $150,000 payment to McDougal was made by the then-publisher of the supermarket tabloid National Enquirer, which kept her story from coming to light.Federal prosecutors agreed not to prosecute the Enquirer's corporate parent in exchange for its cooperation in a campaign finance investigation that led to charges against Cohen in 2018. Prosecutors said the payments to Daniels and McDougal amounted to impermissible, unrecorded gifts to Trump’s election effort.Cohen pleaded guilty, served prison time and was disbarred. Federal prosecutors never charged Trump with any crime.___Long reported from Washington. Associated Press writer Michael R. Sisak contributed.",2023/3/18,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839284,"6 women who went missing in Mexico were killed, burned","MEXICO CITY (AP) — Prosecutors in Mexico confirmed Friday that six women who went missing on March 7 were killed and their bodies burned by a gang of armed men.It was one of the largest collective killings of a group of women in recent years in Mexico.The women disappeared earlier this month on a road near the city of Celaya in the farming and industrial state of Guanajuato. Relatives had held out hope they might be found alive.But state prosecutor Carlos Zamarripa said Friday that experts had found skeletal remains “almostly completely burned” in raids on several properties Thursday. The amount of bone fragments found — Zamarripa said they were “hundreds” — suggests the women's bodies were burned and the bones were ground up and scattered, a common drug cartel tactic.“They took the six women to Juventino Rosas, where they later killed them,” Zamarripa said. He said the motive for the killings was still under investigation.DNA tests matched five of the missing women, and more test were being conducted.Nearly two dozen guns, explosives and thousands of doses of drugs were also found at the properties, he said. The plastic-wrapped body of a male kidnap victim was also found at one of the properties.Zamarripa said 14 men arrested in connection with that and other killings. At least five of the suspects were from the northern border state of Tamaulipas, and one of them was a Honduran man.Tamaulipas is split between the Gulf cartel and the Northeast Cartel. It was not clear what either group would be doing in Guanajuato, which is hundreds of miles to the south.Authorities had posted search bulletins for the six women on March 9, and had said for more than a week they hoped to find them alive.For years, the industrial and farming hub of Guanajuato has been Mexico’s most violent state, with the Jalisco cartel waging a turf war there against local gangs, including the Santa Rosa de Lima cartel, which is apparently being supported by the much larger Sinaloa cartel.",2023/3/18,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839287,Haiti PM turns to military for help in fighting gangs,"PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — Prime Minister Ariel Henry signaled Friday that he wants to mobilize Haiti’s military to help the National Police fight the country’s increasingly powerful gangs.Henry said during an appearance at the Armed Forces headquarters that he intends to mobilize all of the country’s security forces in the fight against gang violence. His comments come as Haiti and some U.N. officials continue to press the international community to deploy foreign armed troops to help quell the widespread violenceJean Robenson Servilius, who works in the press office for Haiti’s Defense Ministry, confirmed to The Associated Press that officials are working on plans to activate the military. He said the Armed Forces currently have some 2,000 soldiers and that more are being recruited, adding that they’ve been trained by experts in Argentina, Mexico and Colombia.Robenson said he could not provide further details.Haiti’s military was disbanded in 1995 after it participated in multiple coups and was accused of other political interference. The Armed Forces were reinstated by slain President Jovenel Moïse in 2017 after the U.N. ended its peacekeeping operation in Haiti known as MINUSTAH.Since then, it has played a limited role, which includes providing protection to Haiti’s prime minister.“Are we ready to work hand-in-hand with the police force in the fight against insecurity?” Henry asked during his visit to Haiti’s military headquarters.It was not immediately clear when the military would be activated, how many soldiers would be called to duty or what role they would play. But Henry stressed their help was needed.“The Haiti that we want, we will not be able to build it with gangs that are rampant everywhere. They must listen to reason, or we will make them listen to reason in spite of themselves,” he said.Gangs control an estimated 60% of the capital of Port-au-Prince, and they have killed hundreds of people in recent months in their fight to control more territory in the aftermath of the July 2021 assassination of Moïse at his private home. Tens of thousands of Haitians have been displaced by the ongoing violence, which U.N. officials say has reached levels not seen in decades.",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839288,African land snails found in luggage at Michigan airport,"ROMULUS, Mich. (AP) — Six giant African land snails have been found in the luggage of a traveler who flew to Michigan from the west African country of Ghana.The mollusks, which can carry diseases that affect humans, were discovered and seized March 9 during an agriculture inspection at Detroit Metropolitan Airport in Romulus, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said Friday.The man transporting the snails is a resident of Ghana and said they were to be eaten. He was released without further actions.“It is not uncommon for travelers to bring food items from their native countries, which underscores the importance of the inspection process upon arrival to U.S. ports of entry,” Customs and Border Protection spokesman Steven Bansbach said. “This allows CBP officers and agriculture specialists the opportunity to determine whether these goods are permissible or not, while mitigating the potential for public health or environmental issues.”Giant African land snails are prohibited in Michigan and the rest of the United States. They eat at least 500 different types of plants, along with plaster and stucco on buildings.They grow as long as 8 inches (20 centimeters) and carry a parasite called the rat lungworm that can cause meningitis in humans. They also can produce up to 1,200 eggs a year.“Our CBP officers and agriculture specialists work diligently to target, detect, and intercept potential threats before they have a chance to do harm to U.S. interests,” Port Director Robert Larkin said.",2023/3/18,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839290,Houston's March Madness hopes may come down to Sasser health,"BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) — For top-seeded Houston, any hope of winning a national title may come down to Marcus Sasser’s ailing groin.Not to worry, Sasser said Friday.He's definitely playing in the Cougars' next NCAA Tournament game.“It's not a game-time decision no more,"" Sasser said, sitting at his locker in Legacy Arena, the same spot where the outlook seemed so much bleaker less than 24 hours earlier. “I feel great. I feel good. I feel normal.”The All-American guard pulled himself out of a hard-fought victory over 16th-seeded Northern Kentucky in the March Madness opener, casting serious doubts on his status for a second-round game Saturday against Auburn.Especially when Sasser said afterward that the pain felt ""around a seven out of 10.”But the groin felt better before he went to bed. When he awoke, it seemed just fine.Sasser now wonders if he was being a little too cautious because he didn’t want to risk a more serious problem.“When I first woke up, I walked around and I didn't feel no pain,"" he said. “I was like, ‘I’m going for sure.'""But Sasser conceded that the high stakes of the game certainly had an impact on his decision. He probably would've considered sitting out, just to be on the safe side, if this was a meaningless contest in December.Groin injuries can be notoriously tricky when trying to determine if an athlete is fully recovered, which prompts trainers to be especially mindful to the risk of reinjury.“This a win-or-go-home game,” Sasser said. “I'm going to go out and give it my all. You really don't know when your last game is. Plus, this is my last year of college, so I definitely want to go out with a bang.”Coach Kelvin Sampson didn't express any regrets about starting Sasser five days after he injured his groin in the American Athletic Conference Tournament, saying he left the decision in the hands of the training staff and his star player.“It’s not the first injury I’ve dealt with,” Sampson said. “I deal with his injury like I’ve dealt with every injury of any kid we’ve had for 34 years. It’s up to him and the trainer. I don’t make any decisions. They say, ‘Why did you play him?’ I didn’t. I play him if he’s healthy, if the trainer thinks he can go and the kid thinks he can go. I trust Marcus.”Sasser didn't sound all that hopeful after playing less than 14 minutes against Northern Kentucky. He scored five points — well below his team-leading 17.1 average — and didn't return after halftime.He said the pain returned in his groin when he went up on a jumper, the last of only three five shots he attempted on the night.Sampson said it will be up to Sasser to determine how many minutes he plays against Auburn.“He’s our best player, I know that,” Sampson said. “But I don’t treat him any different than I treat anybody else if they’re injured. 'Point guard Jamal Shead said he didn't have any doubts that Sasser would be ready to play against Auburn.“I was pretty confident he'd play. It's win or go home now, and he's a tough dude,” said Shead, who has been bothered by a sore knee. “If this was our last game together and he didn't play, that would haunt him a little bit.”Sampson conceded that the Cougars are a different team when they don't have Sasser leading the way in the backcourt.That was evident in the way Houston struggled against Northern Kentucky, which came in as an 18 1/2-point underdog but was tied with the Cougars five minutes into the second half.Houston (32-3) eventually pulled away for a 63-52 victory, but it hardly looked like a team that can make a deep run in the tournament without Sasser.“The team we had on the floor is not the team we played (most) times this year,"" Sampson said. “Everybody kind of shifts around and you have to reassign roles, all that stuff.”Sasser was injured last Saturday in an AAC semifinal victory over Cincinnati. He didn't play the following day in the conference championship game, merely watching as the Cougars were upset by Memphis.Sasser got the next two days off, and only did a light workout the day before the NCAA opener. Shortly before tipoff against Northern Kentucky, he was announced as a starter.In retrospect, it seemed like the wrong move.But Sasser felt it was important to get back on the court as soon as possible, ""just to have that game feeling again.”“I felt like it was a positive and a negative,” he said. “I was back out there on the court, moving again, moving full speed, and it kind of gave me confidence for tomorrow's game.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/18,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839294,March Madness without Self: Roberts has KU running smoothly,"DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — Norm Roberts appears to have transitioned smoothly into his acting head coach role for top-seeded Kansas despite all the day-to-day uncertainty and chatter about Bill Self's status in the NCAA Tournament.Roberts said Friday that Self was doing well in his recovery from the heart procedure he had less than two weeks ago but that it was unknown if Self would be on the bench for Saturday's second-round West Region game against Arkansas.The 57-year-old Roberts is Self's right-hand man, having been on Self's staff at four coaching stops. Backup guard Joseph Yesufu described Roberts as a “mirror image” of Self.“We have been together for almost 25 years, so we probably do finish each other's sentences in basketball terms,” Roberts said.The Jayhawks beat Howard 96-68 in the first round on Thursday. Other than Self not being with the team on the bench, the Jayhawks' routine is mostly unchanged. The staff meets with Self twice a day to prepare for the next opponent, and Self has been at all the team's practices in Des Moines.Asked if he tries to channel Self when making in-game decisions, Roberts said he does.“I do try to think of what he would want to do,” Roberts said. “If it's a situation of getting the ball inside, if it's a situation of trapping the ball screen, where we would want to attack. Those are things we talk about a lot before the game begins on ... what we want to do, how we want to play the game. So I just revisit that in my head and coach that way.”Before the Jayhawks' win over Howard, Self said in an interview with the team's radio network that he is feeling stronger but that he didn't think he was to the point he could run the team during a game.Self went to the emergency room the night of March 8, shortly after watching the Jayhawks hold a final shootaround ahead of their Big 12 Tournament quarterfinal. He was complaining of chest tightness and concerns with his balance. The 60-year-old had two stents placed to help treat blocked arteries.Kansas is 3-1 in Self's absence, with the loss coming to Texas in the Big 12 Tournament championship game.Players said Roberts is intense in practice and as competitive as Self in game situations.“His pregame speeches get you pretty pumped up,” Kevin McCullar said. “You want to go out there and run through a brick wall sometimes.”Arkansas coach Eric Musselman, a former NBA coach, said Self allowed him to attend practices and meetings when he was looking at getting into the college game.“Certainly we all want Coach to be as healthy as possible and to get back to coaching as quick as he can,” Musselman said. “But having said that, they’re a well-oiled machine in how they go about their business and how they execute.”___AP Sports Writer Dave Campbell contributed to this report.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/18,,World

Logan Johnson had 12 points and 10 rebounds — part of a strong effort in the paint for Saint Mary’s — and reserve Augustas Marciulionis scored 13 points.Saint Mary’s will play No. 4 seed UConn on Sunday. The Huskies advanced with an 87-63 victory over Iona.In a matchup of the Gaels' more deliberate style and the Rams’ up-tempo game, Saint Mary’s controlled most of the action.“I thought we’d beat them inside,"" Saint Mary's coach Randy Bennett said. “Both teams have good guards. It was a gritty game, and we just kind of outlasted them a little bit and got a little separation and were able to hang on.”Ace Baldwin led VCU (27-8) with 13 points, but he hurt his right Achilles tendon and groin after taking a jumper with just over 14 minutes left in regulation. The Atlantic 10 Conference Player of the Year and Defensive Player of the Year lay on the court for a couple of minutes before receiving treatment on the bench and back in the locker room.VCU was down 38-34 when Baldwin left and 48-39 when he came back with 9:03 left after the Gaels of the West Coast Conference went on a 10-5 spurt sparked by a three-point play by Kyle Bowen.Baldwin hit a jump shot after returning but left the floor for good three minutes later.“It’s a bummer,"" VCU coach Mike Rhoades said.

The Rams had 47 against Memphis.“The whole second half, our message to each other was keep plugging, keep running our offense, and they’re going to break,” Saxen said. “(The injury) might have been the tipping point that broke the dam, but I think it’s a testament to our persistence and just trusting each other that we were able to just keep plugging until the water broke.”The NCAA appearance was the first for 12th-seeded VCU since it had to forfeit a game in the 2021 tournament because of a COVID-19 outbreak. The Rams had won nine in a row.Saint Mary's held a 29-28 halftime lead in a rugged contest where neither team led by more than four points and tight, tough defense was the norm.SHOOTING WOESSaint Mary's shot 3 for 17 from 3-point range and 41% (20 for 49) overall. Freshman guard Aidan Mahaney, who was averaging 14.5 points, was 0 for 5 from the field and didn't score for the first time this season.“Like I said before, this is the best sporting event in this country,” Bennett said. “So everybody’s watching. There’s a little pressure there. I look forward to seeing him play Sunday. He’s a good player. He got in foul trouble, and he didn’t have a great game today, but he’ll bounce back.”VCU wasn't much better. It only made six field goals in the second half. It shot 36.7% (18 for 48). Baldwin was its only player in double figures.BIG PICTUREVCU: The Rams have a lot coming back, so they should be able to contend next season.Saint Mary's: The Gaels showed they can play defense, too. ...

(AP) — Zia Cooke scored 11 points as No. 1 South Carolina moved five wins away from a perfect season after opening the women's NCAA Tournament with a 72-40 victory over No. 16 seed Norfolk State on Friday.Aliyah Boston had seven points, nine rebounds and two blocks for the Gamecocks (33-0), who won their 39th straight game dating back to last year's NCAA title run and moved to 11-0 in first-round games under coach Dawn Staley. They’ll face No. 8 seed South Florida on Sunday for a spot in the Sweet 16.This was a colossal mismatch from the tip like so many other games South Carolina's been a part of this season.Norfolk State's tallest player is freshman forward Skye Robinson at 6-foot-2. South Carolina has seven players that tall or taller. The Spartans' tallest player on the bench? Larry Vickers, the team's 6-9 head coach, who walked onto the Spartans' men's team and eventually became a team captain.South Carolina did its best to end any drama early as Boston and Cooke scored five points apiece in the opening quarter for a 20-7 lead.The Gamecock starters picked things up in the third quarter scoring the first six points to lead 40-18 and the Spartans could not hope to catch up. The lead swelled to 30 points after three quarters with few in the mostly full and garnet-colored stands complaining.Vickers joked on Thursday he wasn't sure how much of a home game this was until walking around the arena and seeing Staley's ceiling-to-door length banner in the building's main entrance.Kierra Wheeler led Norfolk State with 13 points. The Spartans came in shooting almost 40% on the season, but were held to 16 of 61 (26%) by the Gamecocks.South Carolina's second-round opponent, South Florida, won the American Athletic Conference's regular season and features a pair of top scorers in Elena Tsineke and Dulcy Fankam Mendjiadeu. Fankam Mendjiadeu has 24 double doubles this season, more than the Gamecocks' Boston, who has 20.BIG PICTURENorfolk State: The Spartans were beaten in the title game of the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference a year ago, fueling this season's run to a league tournament title and first NCAA Tournament berth since 2002. Vickers' team has a base of five sophomores he hopes can gain experience so their next trip to the tournament won't take so long.South Carolina: The Gamecocks weren't tested and used several younger, rising players like Sania Feagin, Chloe Kitts and Talaysia Cooper who wouldn't see much action in a tighter game. Staley believes this can prep those less experienced team members to be ready if called on in a big spot.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/18,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839300,16 seed Fairleigh Dickinson topples No. 1 seed Purdue,"COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Fairleigh Dickinson became the second No. 16 seed in history to win an NCAA Tournament game, stunning top-seeded Purdue 63-58 behind 19 points from Sean Moore and a relentless, hustling defense on Friday night.The shortest team in the tourney, the Knights (21-15) showed no fear in swarming 7-foot-4 All-America center Zach Edey from the start. FDU’s players were quicker and more composed than the Big Ten champion Boilermakers (29-6).Five years ago, UMBC showed the way for the little guys by overwhelming Virginia in the first 16-over-1 victory after numerous close calls over the years. Still, No. 16s had a 1-150 record against No. 1s and were 1-151 overall before FDU’s shocker.The Knights will now meet Memphis or Florida Atlantic on Sunday for a Sweet 16 berth in the East Region and a trip next week to play at Madison Square Garden in New York — just a short drive from the private school’s campus in Teaneck, New Jersey.Fairleigh Dickinson didn’t even win the Northeast Conference Tournament, falling by one point in the title game to Merrimack, which couldn’t participate in the NCAA Tournament because of an NCAA rule that bars it from the postseason because it’s still completing its four-year transition from Division II.FDU held Purdue scoreless for more than 5 1/2 minutes down the stretch and moved ahead by five on a 3-pointer by Moore — who is from suburban Columbus — with 1:03 left. The Knights held on from there, becoming the second straight double-digit seed to send the Boilermakers home. Purdue was a 3 seed when it lost to 15 seed Saint Peter’s, another small New Jersey school, in the Sweet 16 last year.Edey finished with 21 point and 15 rebounds in what may have been his final college game, but the Knights consistently denied him the ball in the second half. He didn’t attempt a shot in the final nine minutes.FLORIDA ATLANTIC 66, MEMPHIS 65COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Nicholas Boyd drove into the lane and made a floater with 2.5 seconds left, and Florida Atlantic beat Memphis in a rugged, back-and-forth game for the school’s first-ever NCAA Tournament win.Coach Penny Hardaway’s Tigers (26-9) had the ball and a one-point lead with 19 seconds left, but a steal by Brandon Weatherspoon and a subsequent jump ball — Hardaway argued his team had called timeout before the tie-up — gave the Owls (32-3) a chance, and Boyd converted.Giancarlo Rosado scored 15 points to lead ninth-seeded FAU, which advanced to face a surprising opponent, No. 16 seed Fairleigh Dickinson, in the second round.Kendric Davis scored 16 points despite being hobbled by a second-half leg injury for eighth-seeded Memphis. DeAndre Williams added 13 points while playing most of the second half with four fouls for the Tigers, including a tip-in that put his team ahead 65-64 with 34 seconds left.KENTUCKY 61, PROVIDENCE 53GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) — Oscar Tshiebwe pulled down 25 rebounds, the second-most in the tournament since 1973, and Kentucky beat Providence.Antonio Reeves scored 22 points and Jacob Toppin had 18 for the sixth-seeded Wildcats (22-11), who advanced to face Kansas State Sunday in the East Region.Eleven of Tshiebwe's rebounds came on the offensive glass — a big factor in the Wildcats staying in control as both offenses grinded to a halt after halftime.With the two-time Associated Press All-American grabbing just about every loose ball, Kentucky finished with a 48-31 rebounding advantage, controlling the offensive glass (plus-10) and dominating in second-chance points, 18-2.Ed Croswell scored 16 points for Providence (21-12), which shot just 36.2% while making 5 of 24 3-pointers.KANSAS STATE 77, MONTANA STATE 65GREENSBORO, N.C.

Nae’Qwan Tomlin added 13 points for Kansas State (24-9).RaeQuan Battle had 26 points on 9-of-17 shooting for Montana State (25-10), which had its eight-game win steak snapped.MICHIGAN STATE 72, SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA 62COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Joey Hauser scored 17 points and No. 7 seed Michigan State clamped down defensively on No. 10 seed Southern California in the second half.Coach Tom Izzo’s Spartans (20-12) will face Marquette on Sunday in the East Region for a spot in the Sweet 16.Tyson Walker and Jaden Akins added 12 points apiece for Michigan State, which held USC to 34% shooting in the second half.Joshua Morgan scored 14 and Kobe Johnson 13 to lead the Trojans (22-11), who were knocked out in the tournament’s first round for the second straight year.MARQUETTE 78, VERMONT 61COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Kam Jones scored 18 straight points for Marquette in the second half, and the second-seeded Golden Eagles beat No. 15 seed Vermont for their first NCAA Tournament victory in a decade.Jones finished with 19 points.

Marquette won its first NCAA Tournament game in a decade and advanced to face Michigan State on Sunday.Dylan Penn, Matt Veretto and Robin Duncan each had 11 points for Vermont (23-11), whose 15-game win streak was snapped.Jones made a 3-pointer early in the second half to begin an 18-6 spurt during which he scored all of Marquette’s points as the Golden Eagles pulled ahead 63-46.MIDWEST REGIONXAVIER 72, KENNESAW STATE 67GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) — Jack Nunge blocked Terrell Burden’s driving attempt at a go-ahead layup in the final seconds, and Xavier dug out of a 13-point hole against surprising Kennesaw State.Souley Boum hit four clinching free throws in the final 2.6 seconds for the third-seeded Musketeers (26-9), who ran off 15 unanswered points as part of a game-ending 24-6 run. That was enough to turn away the 14th-seeded Owls (26-9) in the program’s first-ever March Madness game.Xavier moves on to face Pittsburgh on Sunday.Xavier led 68-67 when Burden — who’d been successful all day with dribble penetration — turned into the paint past Jerome Hunter and appeared to have a path to the rim.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839301,Top-seeded Hoosiers end long break as March Madness begins,"BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) — The Indiana Hoosiers got back to work Friday with a sharp and spirited NCAA Tournament practice.They've been waiting an excruciatingly long time to relish this moment.Since clinching their first Big Ten regular season title in 40 years on Feb. 19, the top-seeded Hoosiers have played just three games. They were able to rest, rehab and recharge from a brutal conference slate, as well as refocus after losing twice during the final stretch.“It's given us great motivation to get back in practice and certainly figure out some of those things we didn't do well enough, why we lost the games but also it's been a great time for us to rest,” Indiana coach Teri Moren said. “I don't know if it's a silver lining, but I think it's been good for us to be able to have some extra time off because of the schedule we played.”The Hoosiers' top two players, All-American center Mackenzie Holmes and all-conference guard Grace Berger, certainly needed the time off after averaging more than 30 minutes per game.But it's not just fatigue: The league's depth and physical style of play takes its toll on bodies. Plus, Moren acknowledged, some of her players felt ill before Indiana lost 79-75 to Ohio State on March 4.Everyone looked fine Friday as blaring music and the constant clapping of hands bounced off the Assembly Hall walls during the open portion of practice. They were dancing in the locker room, too.The risk, of course, is that long breaks can throw off teams and make them stale.But after finishing the season ranked an all-time best No. 2, earning the school's first No. 1 seed and being picked by former President Barack Obama to reach the national championship game, the Hoosiers insist they're not going to let anything derail their Final Four aspirations.They open play Saturday against 16th-seeded Tennessee Tech (23-9).“Just to know that we have that spotlight on us right now that we have the potential to make a run in this tournament is very exciting,” guard Sydney Parrish said.The Golden Eagles, in contrast, have been busy — and winning.They've played six times in 21 days, won eight straight, claimed their first Ohio Valley Conference tourney title in 23 years and have to face Indiana on the Hoosiers' home court just 36 1/2 hours after posting their first NCAA Tournament win in 33 years, 79-69 over Monmouth in the play-in round.Tennessee Tech has never won twice in the same NCAA tourney and none of its players have competed in front of a crowd larger than 6,400. Indiana officials have sold more than 12,000 tickets for Saturday's doubleheader“We're all giddy and excited because this is something we've all dreamed about,” sixth-year guard Jordan Brock said. “But we are prepared for this (quick turnaround) because we do this in our conference. So we're just going to focus on us.”THE UNDERDOGSOklahoma State could have come to Bloomington playing the numbers game.With a first-year coach and a completely revamped roster, the team was picked to finish ninth in the Big 12. Instead, following a fourth-place finish, they wound up in Bloomington as the No. 8 seed paired against ninth-seeded Miami in Saturday's second game.Oklahoma State has lost four of five but isn't worried.“Whatever happened before, at this point, it doesn't matter,” said guard Naomie Alnatas, who followed coach Jacie Hoyt from Kansas City to Oklahoma State. “We want to win, and if it has nothing to do with winning, guess what? It doesn't matter.”The Hurricanes (19-12) also struggled late this season — and historically in NCAA play. They've lost four of their last seven, are 5-8 away from their home court and are 3-6 since in the NCAA Tournament since 2015.Still, they are confident they can make it out of the first round.""What we learned last year was that these eight-nine games are the juiciest, best games of the tournament,"" Miami coach Katie Meier said. “They are fun. Both teams are hungry. We've been in these games for two months, it's another one of those games.""___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839302,Ex-Tennessee lawmaker asks judge to withdraw guilty plea,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — A former Tennessee state senator accused of violating federal campaign finance laws is seeking to withdraw his guilty plea, arguing that he initially did so with “unsure heart and confused mind.”Brian Kelsey had entered a guilty plea before a federal judge in November in the case related to a failed 2016 congressional campaign. Before that, Kelsey had previously pleaded not guilty — often describing his case as a “political witch hunt” — but changed his mind shortly after his co-defendant, Nashville social club owner Joshua Smith, pleaded guilty to one count under a deal that required him to “cooperate fully and truthfully” with federal authorities.Kelsey pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud the Federal Election Commission as well as aiding and abetting the acceptance of excessive contributions on behalf of a federal campaign. He faces up to five years in prison for each count. Yet on Friday, Kelsey's new legal team filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea and asked the court to dismiss his case.""Though not the norm, it is permissible to withdraw a guilty plea and file a motion to dismiss,"" court documents state.“Brian Kelsey was given less than 48 hours to make a decision on his plea agreement at a time when he was contending with his father on his death bed due to pancreatic cancer and newborn twins,” the documents explain. “Under these circumstances, he was in a confused state mentally and unable to fully consider the ramifications of his plea agreement. In short, he had an unsure heart and a confused mind and should be permitted to withdraw his plea.”The motion then says Kelsey was unaware of the consequences of pleading guilty because he had no prior criminal record. Those consequences have included his bank cutting off his credit card and the suspension of his law license.After Kelsey filed his motion on Friday, U.S. attorneys requested two weeks to respond directly while also asking the court to continue with sentencing hearings scheduled to take place later this year.In October 2021, a federal grand jury in Nashville indicted Kelsey and Smith, who owns The Standard club, on several counts each. The indictment alleged that Kelsey, Smith and others violated campaign finance laws by illegally concealing the transfer of $91,000 — $66,000 from Kelsey’s state Senate campaign committee and $25,000 from a nonprofit that advocated about legal justice issues — to a national political organization to fund advertisements urging support of Kelsey’s congressional campaign.Prosecutors allege that Kelsey and others caused the national political organization to make illegal and excessive campaign contributions to Kelsey by coordinating with the nonprofit on advertisements, and that they caused the organization to file false reports to the Federal Election Commission.Kelsey, a 44-year-old attorney from Germantown, was first elected to the General Assembly in 2004 as a state representative. He was later elected to the state Senate in 2009.",2023/3/18,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839304,Expansion St. Louis City goes for 4th win in MLS start,"For Kyle Hiebert, St. Louis City’s success is nothing short of surreal for Kyle. Expansion teams simply aren't supposed to make such a first impression.The young defender scored his first Major League Soccer goal last weekend when St. Louis defeated the Portland Timbers 2-1 on the road.The individual goal was great, but Hiebert said it was more important that City had won its first three matches — matching the Seattle Sounders' 2009 record for best start by an expansion team.Normally, expectations are lowered for new franchises.“I think we bought in — I know I bought in — to the underdog mentality. You know, everyone writing us off before the season even began, it’s something that’s added fire to me and I know it’s added fire to this whole team as well,” Hiebert said.St. Louis will have a chance to top the record Saturday night when it hosts the San Jose Earthquakes.What makes City's start all the more remarkable is that they came from behind in all three victories — the first time a team has recorded three consecutive come-from-behind wins since the LA Galaxy in 2015.St. Louis is the first MLS team to do in it the first three games of the season.“We just have confidence in the group and a calmness in the group,"" St. Louis coach Bradley Carnell said. ""We’ve overcome a lot of adversity over the last couple of weeks, like going down goals and showing great team resolve a great spirit and to come back every time before the half. It’s been good momentum going into halftime, and then we know we have a very solid roster and guys coming off the bench to make a difference.""Jared Stroud and Joao Klauss each have a pair of goals, and Eduard Lowen leads the league with three assists. Klauss and Lowen have contributed to a goal or scored in each of the team's three matches, the first MLS newcomers to do so since Carlos Vela and Diego Rossi in 2018 for LAFC.St. Louis is the only team in MLS that has three straight wins to open this season. LAFC has won both of its games. Atlanta, Nashville and Cincinnati are undefeated, with each team winning two matches and tying one.“Every game we’ve had to show resilience, that we can be a team that will keep fighting, a team that can come from behind,"" said Hiebert, a Canadian who went Missouri State and played for St. Louis 2 last season. “I think it gives us a lot of confidence moving forward. No matter what the situation is, we can be a team that fights and scraps and comes out with three points.”St. Louis was generating buzz even before the team took the field. The club got more than 60,000 deposits for 19,000 available season tickets at its privately built $450 million downtown stadium, which has a view of the iconic Gateway Arch.The city already had a long-held relationship with soccer. Back in 1950, five players from St. Louis started on the national team that memorably defeated England at the World Cup. And Saint Louis University has won 10 national championships in soccer.Carnell said the team's success honors not only the city's rabid soccer supporters, but that history.“I don’t think it’s about creating history or equaling history for us. This group is about honoring the history, honoring the group, you know, that has been here and done it before in St. Louis, not on the MLS level, but it’s almost a tribute to everyone prior, in the ’50s and onwards.""I mean, for 70 years now, this town, St. Louis, they’ve all been itching and hoping for something like this.""___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/18,,World

But they also revealed the perils of global diplomacy: Hours after Friday's announcement of the trip, an international arrest warrant was issued for Putin on war crimes charges, taking at least some wind out of the sails of China's big reveal.The flurry of developments — which followed China's brokering of an agreement between Saudi Arabia and Iran to resume diplomatic relations and its release of what it calls a “peace plan” for Ukraine — came as the Biden administration watches warily Beijing's moves to assert itself more forcefully in international affairs.U.S. President Joe Biden said Friday he believes the decision by the International Criminal Court in The Hague to charge Putin was “justified.” Speaking to reporters as he left the White House for his Delaware home, he said Putin “clearly committed war crimes.”While the U.S. does not recognize the court, Biden said it “makes a very strong point” to call out the Russian leader for his actions in ordering the invasion of Ukraine.Other U.S. officials privately expressed satisfaction that an international body had agreed with Washington’s assessment that Russia has committed war crimes and crimes against humanity in Ukraine.Asked about the Xi-Putin meeting, Biden said, “Well, we’ll see when that meeting takes place.”The Biden administration believes China's desire to be seen as a broker for peace between Russia and Ukraine may be viewed more critically now that Putin is officially a war crime suspect, according to two U.S. officials. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the matter publicly, said the administration hopes the warrants will help mobilize heretofore neutral countries to weigh in on the conflict.A look at the Xi-Putin meeting and how it may be affected by the warrant.WHAT IS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF XI MEETING WITH PUTIN?The visit to Russia will be Xi's first foreign trip since being elected to an unprecedented third term as China's president. It comes as Beijing and Moscow have intensified ties in steps that began shortly before Russia's invasion of Ukraine with a meeting between the two leaders in Beijing during last year's Winter Olympics at which they declared a “no limits” partnership.Since then, China has repeatedly sided with Russia in blocking international action against Moscow for the Ukraine conflict and, U.S. officials say, is considering supplying Russia with weapons to support the war. But it has also tried to cast itself in a more neutral role, offering a peace plan that was essentially ignored.The meeting in Moscow is likely to see the two sides recommit to their partnership, which both see as critical to countering what they consider undue and undeserved influence exerted by the U.S. and its Western allies.WHAT IS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE ICC ARREST WARRANT ISSUED FOR PUTIN?In the immediate term, the ICC's warrant for Putin and one of his aides is unlikely to have a major impact on the meeting or China's position toward Russia. Neither China nor Russia — nor the United States or Ukraine — has ratified the ICC's founding treaty. The U.S., beginning with the Clinton administration, has refused to join the court, fearing that its broad mandate could result in the prosecution of American troops or officials.That means that none of the four countries formally recognizes the court's jurisdiction or is bound by its orders, although Ukraine has consented to allowing some ICC probes of crimes on its territory and the U.S. has cooperated with ICC investigations.In addition, it is highly unlikely that Putin would travel to a country that would be bound by obligations to the ICC. If he did, it is questionable whether that country would actually arrest him. There is precedent for those previously indicted, notably former Sudanese President Omar Bashir, to have visited ICC members without being detained.However, the stain of the arrest warrant could well work against China and Russia in the court of public opinion and Putin's international status may take a hit unless the charges are withdrawn or he is acquitted.WHAT IS THE VIEW FROM WASHINGTON?U.S. officials have not minced words when it comes to Xi's planned visit to Moscow. White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby called Beijing’s push for an immediate cease-fire in Ukraine a “ratification of Russian conquest” and warned that Russians could use a cease-fire to regroup their positions “so that they can restart attacks on Ukraine at a time of their choosing.”“We do not believe that this is a step towards a just, durable peace,” he said. Biden’s national security adviser Jake Sullivan this week called on Xi to also speak with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian leader has also expressed interest in talks with Xi.WHAT IS THE VIEW FROM KYIV?Speaking before the ICC warrant was unveiled, Ukrainian analysts cautioned against falling into a potential trap ahead of the Xi-Putin meeting. “We need to be aware that such peace talks are a trap for Ukraine and its diplomatic corps,” said Yurii Poita, who heads the Asia section at the Kyiv-based New Geopolitics Research Network.“Under such conditions, these peace talks won’t be directed toward peace,” said Nataliia Butyrska, a Ukrainian analyst on politics related to Eastern Asia. She said the visit reflects not so much China's desire for peace but its desire to play a major role in whatever post-conflict settlement may be reached.“China does not clearly distinguish between who is the aggressor and who is the victim. And when a country begins its peacekeeping activities or at least seeks to help the parties, not distinguishing this will affect objectivity,” Butyrska said. “From my perspective, China seeks to freeze the conflict.”WHAT IS THE VIEW FROM MOSCOW?Even if China stops short of providing military assistance to Russia as the U.S. and its allies fear, Moscow sees Xi's visit as a powerful signal of Chinese backing that challenges Western efforts to isolate Russia and deal crippling blows to its economy.Kremlin spokesman Yuri Ushakov noted that Putin and Xi have “very special friendly and trusting personal ties” and hailed Beijing’s peace plan. “We highly appreciate the restrained, well-balanced position of the Chinese leadership on this issue,” Ushakov said.Observers say that despite China’s posturing as a mediator, its refusal to condemn the Russian action leaves no doubt about where Beijing’s sympathy lies.“The Chinese peace plan is a fig leaf to push back against some Western criticism on support for Russia,” said Alexander Gabuev, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “The optics that it creates is that China has a peace plan, both parties of war endorsed it and were ready to explore the opportunities and then it was killed by the hostile West.”WHAT IS THE VIEW FROM BEIJING?Chinese officials have been boasting about their new-found clout in the international arena as their country's foreign policy has become increasingly assertive under Xi.In announcing the Xi visit, China's foreign ministry said Beijing's ties with Moscow are a significant world force. “As the world enters a new period of turbulence and change, as a permanent member of the UN Security Council and an important power, the significance and influence of China-Russia relations go far beyond the bilateral scope,” it said.It called the visit “a journey of friendship, further deepening mutual trust and understanding between China and Russia, and consolidating the political foundation and public opinion foundation of friendship between the two peoples for generations.”___Associated Press writers Aamer Madhani in Washington and Hanna Arhirova in Kyiv contributed to this report.",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839307,Tougher Texas rolls into March Madness after early stumbles,"AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — There were many times this season Texas coach Vic Schaefer questioned his team's toughness as the Longhorns tumbled from a preseason No. 3 all the to unranked while injuries and early losses mounted.Schaefer has definitely changed his tune now.The Longhorns fought the the early struggles and lineup changes in a surge to a share of the Big 12 regular-season title, the program's first since 2004, and swept co-champ Oklahoma along the way.And just as critically, they earned an all-important No. 4 seed in the women's NCAA tournament that allowed Texas to be one of the host schools for the first two rounds. Texas (25-9) will play No. 13 East Carolina (23-9) Saturday night in the Seattle 4 Region.“I couldn't be more proud of them, for their toughness and resilience because they have overcome a lot,” Schaefer said.After consecutive runs to the Elite Eight the past two seasons, Texas started 5-4 and saw its roster depleted first by a foot injury to star point guard Rori Harmon that forced her out for five games, then a knee injury that ended forward Ailiyah Moore's season on Dec. 11.But that was just the start. The team seemed shaken and unsettled by constantly shifting lineups as rotation players missed a total of 49 games with injuries.Graduate transfer guard Shaylee Gonzales is the only Longhorn to start every game this season. And even those on the court seemed to struggle to shake off their own aches and pains of a long season.“We’re not very tough,” Schafer complained at midseason. “It’s an Achilles of this team.”Harmon, Texas' sparkplug player on both ends of the court, heard that and was determined to change it. She led the resurgence on the court and in the locker room.“Are you going to let it be fuel to your fire,"" Harmon said. ""Or are you going to let it hurt you?”Harmon mirrored her coach with some pointed comments about lack of hustle from teammates after a late-season loss to Baylor.“He wants to make sure I'm holding everyone else accountable around me,” Harmon said. ""I'm trying to do that.""A Texas team hitting its peak faces an East Carolina team on a run of its own. The Pirates are in the tournament for just the third time in program history and the first since 2007. They got here by tearing through the American Athletic Conference tournament.“That's three games in three days. That takes toughness and clearly they have it,” Texas guard Shay Holle said.Dana McNeal leads the Pirates, averaging nearly 18 points per game.Now they face Texas on the Longhorns' new home court. Although Texas has been a frequent host in the NCAA Tournament, the Moody Center is a brand new arena that opened in April 2022. It replaced the 45-year-old Frank Erwin Center just a few blocks away.Guard Synia Johnson said the Pirates won't be intimidated playing so far from home. They won their conference tournament far from home in Fort Worth, Texas.“We had no fans really at all,"" Johnson said. “You could count on one hand how many fans we had. We still came out on top. As long as we have each other.”LOUISVILLE vs. DRAKELike Texas, No. 5 seed Louisville (23-11) was in the top 10 in the preseason only to plummet out of the rankings. A Final Four team a year ago, Louisville had four losses by early December.The Cardinals are not hosting the first two rounds for the first time since 2015, not including the 2021 tournament when the entire thing was played in Texas because of the pandemic.Drake (22-9) was the highest-scoring team in the Missouri Valley Conference and averaged 82 points over its last five games. The Bulldogs' 48% shooting ranked No. 5 nationally, and five players average 10 points or more. Drake reached the NCAA Tournament by winning the MVC tournament.“They read and react extremely well at the offensive end,” Louisville coach Jeff Walz said. “If you have a mental breakdown, they're going to expose you.”The Bulldogs can get sloppy with the ball. Drake averaged nearly 18 turnovers per game, and Louisville has turned up the pressure of late. The Cardinals averaged 20 points of turnovers in the ACC tournament.That comes with the territory of the up-tempo offense they play, Bair said.“Limiting our turnovers and not shooting ourselves in the foot is key for us,” Bair said. “Try to limit them, but I wouldn't change anything now. It's gotten us this far.”___ AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/18,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839320,Elizabeth Holmes returns to court in bid to avoid prison,"SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — Disgraced Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes on Friday made what might be her final court appearance before beginning a 11-year prison sentence, unless a judge grants her request to remain free while her lawyers appeal her conviction for masterminding a blood-testing hoax.The 90-minute hearing came four months after Holmes' last court hearing. That was when U.S. District Judge Edward Davila sentenced her for duping investors in Theranos, a startup she founded 20 years ago and rode to fleeting fame and fortune on her promises of a revolutionary blood-testing technology.Before the hearing started, a man in the audience in the San Jose, California, courtroom tried to approach the table where Holmes was sitting while carrying a document in his hand. He was quickly intercepted by security officers who forcibly removed him. Holmes didn't appear flustered by the disruption.The proceedings ended without a determination whether Holmes, 39, will be able to stay out of prison while her appeal unfolds or have surrender to authorities on April 27, as currently scheduled. Davila said he hopes to issue his ruling in early April.The judge earlier this month rejected a similar bid to avoid prison made by Holmes' former lover and convicted Theranos accomplice, Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani, who is facing a nearly 13-year sentence after a jury found him guilty of 12 counts of fraud and conspiracy. Balwani, 57, was supposed to report to a federal prison in Southern California Thursday, but his lawyer used a last-minute legal maneuver to gain more time.Holmes came to her St. Patrick's Day hearing wearing a black blazer and blue skirt. She recently gave birth to her second child, according to court documents that didn't disclose the gender or birth date.One of her lawyers, Amy Saharia, argued that Holmes should be allowed to remain free because of various missteps in the presentation and omission of evidence during her four-month trial that make it likely an appeals court will overturn her conviction on four counts of fraud and conspiracy.“We think the record is teeming with issues,” Saharia asserted. She specifically cited Davila's refusal to allow the jury to see a sworn deposition that Balwani gave during a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into Theranos' downfall that Holmes' defense team believes would have helped exonerate her.Federal prosecutor Kelly Volkar countered there is “no likelihood for reversal"" of Holmes' conviction and asserted that the trial documented seven different categories of deception that she engaged in while running Theranos. Most of the deceit centered on a device dubbed “Edison” that Holmes had boasted would be able to scan for hundreds of diseases and other health problems with just a few drops of blood taken with a finger prick.But the Edison produced such wildly unreliable results that Theranos began relying on third-party testing equipment already widely used on the market — a switch that Holmes concealed in an effort to keep the company afloat.“That was shocking to investors,” Volkar reminded Davila.The two opposing sides also sparred over how much restitution Holmes should pay defrauded investors whose trust briefly boosted her wealth to $4.5 billion based on Theranos' peak value before its collapse.Federal prosecutor Robert Leach argued her conviction for engineering a conspiracy justified restitution of nearly $900 million to repay Theranos investors swept up in her lies. “Just to apply common sense, the money these investors lost is the money they put in,” Leach said.But Hollmes' lawyer Patrick Looby countered that prosecutors were way off base by pursuing an “all or nothing” restitution amount. He noted that the jury in her trial couldn't reach a verdict on three counts of investor fraud, prompting the prosecutor to dismiss those charges. At most, Looby contended, Holmes' restitution penalty should be limited to the handful of investors who testified during her trial.",2023/3/18,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839322,"What to stream this weekend: 'Night Agent,' Lana Del Rey","From Lana Del Rey's latest album to the new spy thriller series “The Night Agent,” here's a collection curated by The Associated Press’ entertainment journalists of what’s arriving on TV, streaming services and music and video game platforms this week.MOVIES TO STREAM THIS WEEKEND— The Oscar-nominated “All the Beauty and the Bloodshed” was one of the high points in documentary in the past year. In it, Laura Poitras chronicles the pioneering photographer Nan Goldin, juxtaposing an intimate survey of her groundbreaking work in 1970s and 1980s New York and her contemporary crusade against the Sackler family, owners of the Oxycontin-maker Purdue Pharma. Goldin, who has herself wrestled with addiction, led the campaign to eradicate the Sackler name from many of the world’s top museums. Though the film didn’t win at the Oscars — something Goldin told me she was surprised to find she wanted — it took the top prize of the Venice Film Festival. In her review, AP Film Writer Lindsey Bahr called the film” a “holistic portrait of an artist’s battle cry.” After debuting Sunday, March 19, “All the Beauty and the Bloodshed” is available to stream on HBO Max.— “Top Gun: Maverick” did come away with an Academy Award, for best sound. But one of the biggest box office hits of the year otherwise struck out at the Oscars. After an uncommonly long run in theaters, a lucrative stop on video on demand and a streaming launch on Paramount+, “Top Gun Maverick” arrives on a larger streaming platform Friday, March 24th, when it touches down on Amazon’s Prime Video. In his review, AP Entertainment Writer Mark Kennedy called “Maverick” “a textbook example of how to make a sequel.”— This month, the Criterion Channel has been paying tribute to the greatest comic artist of the 20th century: Buster Keaton. With five features and more than a dozen shorts, the series is an unbeatable feast. You can’t go wrong but a few highlights: Keaton’s glorious Olympic finale in “College”; his deft ladder balancing act in “Cops”; and his escape, through a high window, from an angry police chief-slash-furious-father in “The Goat.” With apologies to Charlie Chaplin and Harold Lloyd, nobody did it better.— AP Film Writer Jake CoyleMUSIC TO STREAM THIS WEEKEND— Fans of Lana Del Rey got two albums in 2021 — “Chemtrails Over the Country Club” and Blue Banisters” but nothing full-length in 2022. Now she’s got “Did You Know That There’s a Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd” set to drop Friday. One of the singles, ”A&W,” offers a glimpse at the sing-songwriter’s bleak poetry: “Puts the shower on while he calls me/Slips out the back door to talk to me/I’m invisible, look how you hold me/I’m a ghost now.” The album features Jack Antonoff, Father John Misty, Jon Batiste and more. ( Read AP's review.)— Back in 1984, Phil Collins and Philip Bailey had a hit with the song “Easy Lover.” These days, UK pop star Ellie Goulding and Big Sean have a song with the same title that’s just as infectiously fun, part of Goulding’s 11-track album “Higher Than Heaven.” The songs marry her ethereal voice to strong dance hooks, from the ’80s-inspired “By the End of the Night” and “Just 4 You” to the modern pop of “Cure for Love.”— Do you have what it takes to be a country music’s next big star? Then tune into Apple TV+’s “My Kind of Country,” in which Jimmie Allen, Mickey Guyton and Orville Peck search for talented amateur artists and invite them to Nashville, Tennessee, for a showcase. Reese Witherspoon and Kacey Musgraves also are featured in the series, set to premiere globally on Friday.— 6lack is 6ack! The Atlanta singer-songwriter and rapper known as 6lack — pronounced “black” — returns with “Since I Have a Lover,” his first album in nearly five years. The title track is a airy, sweet ode to love with the lyrics: “Feel like a million bucks or somethin’/ Feel like we need to be up to somethin’/ Not tryna press my luck or nothin’/Don’t wanna love you just for fun.” The artist, raised in Zone 6 of Atlanta, has been doing a lot of collaborations since his last album, including Lil Tjay’s “Calling My Phone” and more recently Jessie Reyez’s “Forever.”— AP Entertainment Writer Mark KennedyTV TO STREAM THIS WEEKEND— Fans of shows including “Jack Ryan” and “The Recruit,” about low-level government agency workers who get pulled into danger and secret missions, should check out “The Night Agent” on Netflix. It follows an FBI agent tasked with manning an overnight emergency phone that surprisingly rings during one of his shifts. A desperate civilian is on the other end of the call and together, they find themselves embroiled in a major government conspiracy. The series stars Gabriel Russo and Luciane Buchanan and is based on the novel by Matthew Quirk. “The Night Agent” debuts Thursday.— Mae Whitman, best-known for her roles in “Parenthood” and “Good Girls,” demonstrates she can also sing in her new rom-com series “Up Here” for Hulu. Set in 1999 in New York, Whitman plays Lindsay who falls for Miguel — played by Carlos Valdes (“The Flash” and “Gaslit”) — and the will-they, won’t-they find a happily ever after ensues. The series boasts some major behind-the-scenes musical talent. EGOT winners Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez, behind that little animated film that could “Frozen,” are co-executive producers and wrote the show’s original music. The show has a whimsical, “Zoey’s Extraordinary Playlist”-vibe, plus there are fun late-'90s references including Y2K. All eight-episodes drop Friday, the same day the soundtrack lands.— Kiefer Sutherland is back with another high-stakes TV drama in “Rabbit Hole” for Paramount+. He plays John Weir, a corporate spy skilled in the art of deception – until he finds the rug pulled out from underneath him and he is framed for murder. Weir goes from having total control to none, and unsure of who can be trusted. “Rabbit Hole” premieres with two episodes on Sunday.— Alicia RancilioVIDEO GAMES TO PLAY THIS WEEKEND— Annapurna Interactive has developed a nearly impeccable reputation among connoisseurs of indie video games, from 2017’s groundbreaking mystery What Remains of Edith Finch to 2022’s futuristic cat sim Stray. The publisher’s latest release is Storyteller, a long-brewing project from Argentine designer Daniel Benmergui. The premise is simple: You have a library of characters, objects, events and other plot devices, and your job is arrange them to tell a particular type of tale. It’s a puzzle game that pays homage to classic literature, and the graphics ooze charm. Start spinning your own yarns Thursday on Nintendo Switch and PC.— Death, the CEO of Death Inc., is burned out. His top minions — the executives in charge of Natural Disasters, Modern Warfare, Toxic Food-Processing and other misery-producing departments — are going about their business way too enthusiastically, and Death needs them to settle down before he drowns in paperwork. In Have a Nice Death, from France’s Magic Design Studios, you wield Death’s scythe as he hacks and slashes his way through the red tape.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839323,Atalanta beats Empoli 2-1 to boost Champions League hopes,"MILAN (AP) — Substitute Rasmus Højlund scored late to help Atalanta fight back to beat Empoli 2-1 in Serie A on Friday and boost its chances of qualifying for the Champions League.Højlund scored the winner just seven minutes after coming off the bench. Marten de Roon had cancelled out Tyronne Ebuehi's opener for Empoli.The victory snapped Atalanta’s winless run and lifted it to within three points of fourth-placed AC Milan, which visits Udinese on Saturday.Empoli remained nine points above the relegation zone.Atalanta had lost three of its past four matches, drawing the other, and lost ground in a tight race for the Champions League spots.It dominated but Empoli took a surprise lead on the stroke of halftime. Atalanta defender Matteo Ruggeri intercepted a cross for Ebuehi but his attempted clearance struck Empoli forward Francesco Caputo and rebounded back to Ebuehi, who tucked it in from point-blank range.De Roon leveled in the 58th by heading in a cross from Ruggeri and notching Atalanta’s first goal in almost a month.Atalanta snatched all three points when, four minutes from time, Mario Pašalić mishit a shot but the ball fell to Højlund to fire it home.FOUR ON THE TROTSassuolo beat relegation-threatened Spezia 1-0 for a fourth straight victory.Domenico Berardi converted a penalty in the 71st after handball by Spezia defender Kelvin Amian.Berardi also hit the crossbar in the first half, while Sassuolo midfielder Abdou Harroui hit the right post late on as the home side had several chances to extend their lead.Spezia, which surprisingly beat Inter Milan last week, remained five points above the drop zone.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/18,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839327,Pitt holds Iowa State to 23% shooting in 59-41 1st-round win,"GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) — Nelly Cummings scored 13 points and No. 11 seed Pittsburgh held sixth-seeded Iowa State to 23% shooting in a 59-41 victory in the first round of the NCAA Tournament on Friday.Jamarius Burton added 11 points and Greg Elliott had 10 for coach Jeff Capel's Panthers, who stormed to a 22-2 lead after Iowa State missed its first 11 shots. Things didn’t get much better for the Cyclones, who had three stretches in which they missed at least eight consecutive shots.Pitt (24-11), which edged Mississippi State in the First Four, moves on to Sunday’s second-round Midwest Region game against third-seeded Xavier, which had to rally from 13 points down to beat No. 14 seed Kennesaw State.“What an unbelievable defensive performance,” Capel said. “We were a really good defensive team for the majority of the year except for the last month of the season — and we’ve really dialed back in these past two games and played at an elite level.”Gabe Kalscheur and Jaren Holmes each had 12 points for Iowa State (19-14), which reached the Sweet 16 last year in coach T.J. Otzelberger’s first season.The Cyclones, who had lost nine of their previous 13 games, didn't make a field goal until Holmes' short jumper with 9:53 left in the first half, which drew a sarcastic cheer from Iowa State fans.Iowa State's poor start came while shooting at the same basket that officials worked to fix before the game, causing a brief delay.“Iowa State asked us during pregame warmups to check if the rim was level,” the NCAA said in a statement. “Building personnel checked it and made a minor adjustment prior to the game beginning. We offered them additional warmup time but they declined.”Otzelberger said he wasn't sure if the issue with the basket might have gotten into his players' heads and contributed to their poor shooting, saying, “you'd have to ask the players.”Kalscheur said it wasn't, adding that players are trained to handle adversity.The Cyclones clawed within 30-23 at the break but started the second half much like they did the first — making two of their first 19 shots.When Pitt’s Nike Sibande was fouled on a 3-pointer from the left corner with under five minutes left and made the ensuing free throw to put the Panthers up by 20, it was all but over.The Cyclones went nearly eight minutes without a field goal in the second half before Tamin Lipsey made a 3-pointer from the corner with 2:13 left to cut the lead to 19.One the biggest highlights for Pitt came late in the second half when wiry 7-foot center Jorge Diaz Graham lofted a perfect pass to his identical twin brother Guillermo for a dunk, causing the Panthers' bench to erupt in celebration.The brothers don't see many minutes on the floor together since they're freshmen and play the same position.“It was a blast of energy,” Guillermo Diaz Graham said. “That ball coming from my brother especially ... it was amazing.”Added Jorge Diaz Graham: “The funny thing is yesterday in practice he dunked on me and (teammate) Nate (Hinson) and he was talking trash. So I told him, ‘OK, you want to talk now, but just do it in a game.’ And so he did, and now I have to shut up and say thank you for making my assist.”Pitt also got an emotional boost from center Federiko Federiko, who received a huge ovation from the Panthers faithful when he checked into the game in the first half. Federiko sat out with a knee injury against Mississippi State and the Panthers were outrebounded by 21.“We’ve had something to prove since the preseason ranked us 14th our conference,” Cummings said. “We’ve had a chip on our shoulder the first time we seen that. Dayton (the First Four site) was just another example of us having to put a chip on our shoulder again. We’re definitely looking forward to proving more.”BIG PICTUREPitt: The Panthers knocked down eight 3s against one of the better defenses in the country when they beat Mississippi State for their first NCAA Tournament win since 2014. They stayed hot against Iowa State, making their first three shots from beyond the arc.Iowa State: Despite playing in the competitive Big 12, the Cyclones weren’t quite ready for the big stage, enduing one of the poorest shooting performances in recent memory.“We’re a team that is fueled by our defense and felt like early we didn’t dictate and disrupt quite as well as we needed to to get our natural rhythm going,” Otzelberger said.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/18,,World

He has the chance to help the team and pass on his experience to other players.""Martínez made very few changes to the squad he inherited from Santos. Pepe, aged 40, was back again in defense, while Ronaldo was joined by João Félix, Bruno Fernandes and Bernardo Silva as playmakers.Martínez joined Portugal after the Spaniard ended his six-year stint with Belgium following the team’s disappointing group-stage elimination at the World Cup.Portugal's Euro 2024 qualifying group also includes Iceland, Slovakia and Bosnia-Herzegovina.___Portugal:Goalkeepers: Diogo Costa (Porto), José Sá (Wolverhampton), Rui Patrício (Roma).Defenders: Diogo Dalot (Manchester United), João Cancelo (Bayern Munich), Danilo Pereira (Paris Saint-Germain), Pepe (Porto), Rúben Dias (Manchester City), António Silva (Benfica), Gonçalo Inácio (Sporting), Diogo Leite (Union Berlin), Nuno Mendes (Paris Saint-Germain), Raphael Guerreiro (Borussia Dortmund).Midfielders: João Palhinha (Fulham), Rúben Neves (Wolverhampton), Bernardo Silva (Manchester City), Bruno Fernandes (Manchester United), João Mário (Benfica), Matheus Nunes (Wolverhampton), Otávio Monteiro (Porto), Vitinha (Paris Saint-Germain).Forwards: Cristiano Ronaldo (Al-Nassr), Gonçalo Ramos (Benfica), João Félix (Chelsea), Rafael Leão (AC Milan), Diogo Jota (Liverpool).___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839329,"Clark, Czinano lead Iowa past SE Louisiana in March Madness","IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) — Iowa had the nation's best scoring offense this season, but the Hawkeyes know a deep run in the women's NCAA Tournament is going to require defense as well.Iowa showed it can shut down an opponent in Friday's 95-43 win over Southeastern Louisiana in a first-round matchup.Caitlin Clark had 26 points and 12 assists and Monika Czinano added 22 points as the second-seeded Hawkeyes (27-6) advanced to play No. 10 seed Georgia in Sunday's second round.The Hawkeyes held Southeastern Louisiana (21-10), the 15th seed, to just 25.4% shooting for the game. The Lady Lions scored just 11 second-half points, making 3 of 32 shots.“Maybe our offense is better than our defense,” Clark said. “But we still think we’re a good defensive team. We’ve really bought into getting better. We know your defense will always be there. Maybe your offense won’t always be there, but (defense) is something you can fall back on.”The Hawkeyes shifted to a zone defense in the second quarter, and stayed in it for the rest of the game.“Really, it was kind of to preserve our legs a little bit,” Iowa coach Lisa Bluder said. “So, first of all, (the zone) was working. And then second of all, why run around chasing screens if you don't have to. We're going to play again on Sunday, so it's nice to sit in a zone, not have to play all of those screens.”“When you look at a Big Ten team, you think they can guard a little Southland school,” Southeastern Louisiana coach Ayla Guzzardo said. “I’ll be honest with you, you would think they could guard us man-to-man. But they went zone. Great game plan because we don’t shoot the three-ball well.”Clark, an Associated Press first-team All-American who was third in the nation in scoring at 27 points per game, added seven assists. She was 9 of 14 from the field.“I’ll be honest, we haven’t seen anything like Caitlin Clark,” Guzzardo said. “What they can do with the ball from a scoring advantage to her passing ... I think that’s where we became on the sideline, saying, ‘That’s a great pass.'”Czinano, third in the nation in field-goal percentage after leading the nation in that category the last two seasons, was 10 of 12 from the field. She added eight rebounds.The Hawkeyes, playing in front of a sellout crowd of 14,382, never trailed. They led 28-17 at the end of the first quarter and 54-32 at halftime. Iowa shot 60.6% in the first half, 60% for the game.“We've seen everything (on defense),” Clark said. “They were physical, they were a scrappy team. But I really don't know what there is you can do to us that we haven't seen.”Iowa hadn't played since winning the Big Ten Tournament championship on March 5, and Bluder was worried about rust.“If anything, we got a little sharper,” Bluder said.Southeastern Louisiana, the Southland Conference regular season and tournament champion, was making its first NCAA Tournament appearance. Cierria Cunningham led the Lady Lions with 15 points.Hannah Stuelke added 13 points for the Hawkeyes, making all five of her shots.BIG PICTURESoutheastern Louisiana: The Lady Lions came into the game ranked 14th in scoring defense, allowing just 54.5 points per game, but the Hawkeyes passed that total early in the second half. Still, the Lady Lions never seemed rattled playing in front of the largest crowd they've seen all season until the second half. “Fourteen thousand is loud,” Guzzardo said. “ It’s loud and tough to call plays and tough to hear anything and tough to hear the refs call fouls. It’s a great atmosphere and something they will remember forever.”Iowa: The Hawkeyes remember last season's second-round exit in a loss to Creighton at home, and they came out strong in this game. They turned in one of their better defensive performances of the season to go with an efficient offense that had 27 assists on 36 field goals. “Any time you can have 27 assists, that's pretty good,"" Bluder said.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839330,Kalkbrenner leads Creighton past NC State in March Madness,"DENVER (AP) — The Creighton Bluejays couldn't hit anything from outside. No worries — OK, maybe a little — they simply went inside to their big man.Ryan Kalkbrenner scored a career-high 31 points and sixth-seeded Creighton overcame a rough 3-point shooting day to fend off No. 11 seed North Carolina State 72-63 on Friday in the first round of the NCAA Tournament.The 7-foot-1 Kalkbrenner did a little bit of everything for the Bluejays, which included hitting a big 3-pointer on a day the team finished 3 of 20 from long range.The slender Kalkbrenner had six dunks and seven rebounds, and N.C. State big men D.J. Burns Jr. and Ebenezer Dowuona were hampered by foul trouble.“Nothing surprises me from Kalk,” Creighton coach Greg McDermott said. ""He’s just improved in every facet of the game, and he was able to score on Burns. But then when they had to go small, we did a good job of executing some offense to get him the ball around the rim, and then he did the rest.""Next up for the Bluejays (22-12) is third-seeded Baylor in the second round in the South Region. The Bears beat Santa Barbara in the early game.Leading 62-59, Baylor Scheierman drained a 3-pointer with 2:23 remaining to give Creighton some separation. A pair of free throws for Kalkbrenner, a block by Trey Alexander and another basket from Scheierman — complete with blowing the crowd a kiss — and the Bluejays were on their way to a hard-earned win.About that kiss: “It was just an in-the-moment thing,” Scheierman explained. “It wasn’t necessarily to anybody.”Kalkbrenner was having a big game in the NCAA Tournament last season — 16 points, 10 rebounds — when he suffered a knee injury in the overtime win over San Diego State. He didn't get to play the next round against eventual national champion Kansas.“Happy to be able to play in it this time,"" Kalkbrenner said.Terquavion Smith led the Wolfpack (23-11) with 32 points on 27 shots. The team started slow, going 0 for 8 from the field to open the game, and never found its rhythm from deep. The team finished 3 for 14 from 3-point range.“We knew their game plan. We knew knew what they were going to do,” said Wolfpack guard Jarkel Joiner, whose team led by seven with 16:48 remaining. “We could’ve been more disruptive because they’re a great passing team.

Their bodies had not been claimed by relatives.They were buried in individual graves in a cemetery in the province of Chiriqui near the border with Costa Rica. About 20 other bodies had already been claimed.The bus was carrying 67 migrants, most from Ecuador, Haiti and Venezuela, when it plunged off a hillside. Many of the migrants had crossed the dangerous Darien Gap into Panama from Colombia.Later that month, Panama's government suspended bus trips carrying the migrants across the country, after a bus caught fire. All the passengers on that bus were evacuated safely.Migrants frequently reach Panama by crossing the roadless, jungle-clad Darien Gap between Colombia and Panama. Panamanian authorities estimate that over 250,000 migrants made the dangerous land crossing in 2020, and that so far this year an additional 50,000 are believed to have made the trip.Panama often allows migrants to travel to the border with Costa Rica, where they generally try to cross Central America and Mexico to reach the U.S. southwestern border.",2023/3/18,,World

Then the guard received a round of encouragement from the Marquette bench during an early second-half timeout.It all just clicked for Jones from there.Jones scored 18 of his 19 points in one stretch of the second half as second-seeded Marquette pulled away from Vermont en route to a 78-61 rout in the first round of the NCAA Tournament on Friday.“Kam, second half, he looked a little down, like somebody took his puppy dog in the timeout,” coach Shaka Smart said. “And we just tried to encourage him, all the coaches and players tried to encourage him. ‘Hey, just be you, man.’ And I thought he did a great job. That’s what allowed us to break the game open.”Oso Ighodaro scored 14 points and David Joplin added 12 as Marquette (29-6) left the Catamounts behind in the last 10 minutes. Marquette won its first NCAA game in a decade and advanced to face seventh-seeded Michigan State on Sunday in the East Regional for a spot in the Sweet 16.Michigan State beat No. 10 Southern California on Friday.Although the win put Marquette in new territory for the first time in 10 years, the NCAA Tournament is routine for Smart. He's made 10 tournament appearances in the last 13 years with three teams, and he led VCU to the Final Four in 2011.His pep talk with Jones helped Marquette advance.Jones' second-half surge included scoring all of Marquette's points in a five-minute stretch, including a trio of 3-point shots. By the time he was finished, the Golden Eagles increased their lead from five points to 17 with just under 10 minutes left.Jones, who averages 14.7 points per game, said he got a pass from Ighodaro that gave him a look for an “easy 3” to start the run.“That just made the basket look wide,” he said. “So I was just able to get it going.”Dylan Penn, Matt Veretto and Robin Duncan each had 11 points for Vermont (23-11), whose 15-game win streak was snapped by the Golden Eagles.Marquette led 39-30 at the half, despite Big East Player of the Year Tyler Kolek hitting only 3 of his 10 shots from the floor.“Kam Jones really killed us in the second half,” Vermont coach John Becker said. “We did a good job on Kolek and didn’t do a good enough job on Kam Jones. Credit to them, they’re really good players. It’s not like we weren’t trying.”Marquette extended its winning streak to 10 games.KOLEK INJUREDSmart said Kolek has a thumb injury but plans to play against Michigan State on Sunday. Kolek wasn’t a big factor in the game, getting his fourth foul early in the second. He finished with eight points after scoring in double figures for the previous 13 games.“He's about as tough as they come,” Smart said. “So if he can play, he’s going to play. You probably have to cut his thumb off to keep him from playing. Even then he’d still try to play.”BIG PICTUREVermont: The Catamounts stayed close for most of the game but couldn't make up the points after the stunning run by Jones.""We cut it to five and we’ll go back and watch that tape and be frustrated by some of the mistakes we made,"" Becker said.Marquette: The Golden Eagles won an NCAA Tournament game for the first time since 2013. It was Smart’s 10th NCAA Tournament appearance in the past 13 years with three teams. In 2011, he led VCU out of the First Four in Dayton, Ohio, all the way to the Final Four.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/18,,World

He joined Lazio for five seasons and added the Italian Cup in 2019. The defensive midfielder returned to Gremio last year.He played 24 matches for the national team from 2007-13.“I am finishing where I would like to, but not in the way I would like to,” said Leiva, who was surrounded by Gremio executives and coaching staff. “I was very hopeful I could reverse this, but it didn't happen. My health comes first.”Gremio doctor Márcio Dornelles said Leiva stopped working at the club three months ago when the first results came. Recent examinations did not show any improvement in his condition.""We finished those exams yesterday, and after we evaluated his fibrosis and the risks around that issue we told Lucas he should not continue high-performance activities,” Dornelles said.Leiva said on Instagram he did not know what was next for him, but called Liverpool his home.“I am a Scouser,” he said. “Thanks to all fans around the world, I am sure you will continue to cheer for me in this new phase in my life.”___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/18,,World

The Badgers (28-10-2) will play for their seventh championship.Ohio State came out aggressively in the first period, getting the first 11 shots on goal as Northeastern didn’t have a shot through the opening nine minutes.Matthews scored her sixth goal of the year to open the scoring just 1:16 into the game when she buried a rebound from national goalie of the year Gwyneth Philips. It was the first shot of the game. The Huskies appeared to tie it at 1-all with 5:39 left in the first, but Ohio State challenged and it was overturned for a hand pass.Ohio State improved to 24-0-1 this season when leading after the first period.Webster scored her 15th goal of the season at 11:16 of the second on a one-touch shot off a pass from Jennifer Gardiner. Hartmetz’s shot from the blue line capped the scoring with 1:16 to go in the second.Amanda Thiele made 16 saves for her fourth shutout of the season.Northeastern (34-3-1), the No. 1 defense in the country, hadn’t allowed more than two goals in a game since a 3-0 loss to Providence on Nov. 15.WISCONSIN 3, MINNESOTA 2, OTWCHA freshman of the year Caroline Harvey scored a game-winner with 3:13 left in overtime to send Wisconsin to the national title game.The Badgers trailed early after Minnesota's Taylor Heise scored in the opening 3:23 of the game to become the first player in the country to reach 30 goals this season. Later Minnesota thought it went ahead by two, but a goal was waived off for a high stick.Neither team would score again until Wisconsin freshman Laila Edwards and fifth-year senior Sophie Shirley found the back of the net 53 seconds apart in the third for a 2-1 lead. Edwards took a faceoff win to the net and got it around Skylar Vetter to tie the game with 13:28 to play. Shirley scored her 12th goal of the season off a 2-on-1 pass from Maddi Wheeler.Minnesota emptied its net for an extra attacker in the closing seconds of regulation and Grace Zumwinkle scored a game-tying goal with 1:11 left.It was the sixth and final meeting between Wisconsin and Minnesota (30-6-3) this season — with the Badgers going 3-1-2.___More AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/18,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839337,Florida man sentenced for role in Jan. 6 Capitol attack,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A Florida man has been sentenced to four years and seven months in federal prison for three felony charges related to the insurrection and storming of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.Mitchell Todd Gardner II, 34, of Seffner, Florida, was sentenced Thursday in federal court in the District of Columbia, according to court records. He pleaded guilty last year to civil disorder, obstruction of an official proceeding, and assaulting, resisting, or impeding officers with a dangerous weapon.Gardner was arrested in Tampa in June 2021.According to court documents, Gardner joined with others in objecting to Democrat Joe Biden’s 2020 election victory over then-President Donald Trump. A mob attacked the Capitol in an attempt to stop Congress from certifying election results for Biden over the Trump, a Republican, authorities have said. Five people died in the violence.According to the criminal complaint, Gardner was part of a mob just outside the lower west terrace tunnel of Congress and used a pepper spray device against officers within the tunnel area. The contents hit one officer directly in the face shield and splattered onto two other officers, officials said.Gardner also urged other rioters to use a ladder to break into a window, prosecutors said. When the ladder was not used, Gardner stood on a window ledge outside of a Senate terrace room and damaged the window with the pepper spray device.While inside the Capitol, Gardner waved to other rioters to come closer or into the building, officials said. He also handed another rioter what looked to be a table or desk leg, and that object was used to assault police officers, prosecutors said.Since Jan. 6, 2021, more than 999 people have been arrested in nearly all 50 states for alleged crimes related to the Capitol breach, officials said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839338,Trump to hold first 2024 rally in Texas this month,"NEW YORK (AP) — Former President Donald Trump will be holding the first rally of his 2024 campaign later this month in Waco, Texas.The rally, announced Friday, will be held the evening of Saturday, March 25, in a Republican state where the former president has a large following, increasing the chances of a packed house.The rally comes as Trump is facing the possibility of becoming the first former president in U.S. history to be indicted, with law enforcement officials in New York currently making security preparations for the possibility of legal action in the coming weeks.Waco holds deep symbolism as the site of the 1993 Waco massacre, when federal agents seized a compound of the Branch Davidians, a religious cult. The siege lasted 51 days and ended with the deaths of cult leader David Koresh and 80 of his followers in a fire 30 years ago next month.It’s not clear that the city’s history played a role in Trump's decision. Trump has made numerous visits to the state over the years and Waco is part of McLennan County, which Trump won in 2020 by more than 23 points.But Trump has long railed against federal law enforcement. When his Mar-a-Lago club was searched by the FBI last summer as part of an investigation into the possible mishandling of classified documents, he broke the news by declaring that his home was ""currently under siege, raided, and occupied by a large group of FBI agents.”Trump spent the first months of his campaign rarely leaving his Florida club, but has begun to make visits to early-voting states. On Monday, he took his first trip to Iowa, which will hold the Republican Party's first nominating contest.The rally plans come as Trump is facing a series of investigations, including one in New York that appears to be nearing its conclusion.Porn actor Stormy Daniels met Wednesday with Manhattan prosecutors who are investigating a $130,000 hush money payment made on Trump’s behalf. That same day, Michael Cohen, the former Trump attorney who orchestrated the payment, delivered a second day of testimony before a New York grand jury.The payment was made in 2016, as Trump’s first presidential campaign was in its final weeks and Daniels was negotiating to appear on television to air her claims of a sexual encounter with Trump a decade earlier.Trump has denied the allegation and blasted the investigation as politically motivated.Waco is also home to Baylor University and the headquarters of “Fixer Upper” stars Chip and Joanna Gaines’ Magnolia home decorating empire.",2023/3/18,,World

He also shared an old video clip in which he said: “Sorry to keep you waiting. Complicated business.”Trump posted the same clip on YouTube, which announced Friday that it, too, was welcoming him back.Facebook parent Meta had said in January that it would be restoring Trump ’s personal account in the coming weeks, ending the suspension it imposed in the wake of the Jan. 6 insurrection, when Trump's supporters violently stormed the U.S. Capitol in a bid to halt the peaceful transition of power.His access was restored to Facebook and Instagram on Feb. 9, the company confirmed.“The public should be able to hear what their politicians are saying — the good, the bad and the ugly — so that they can make informed choices at the ballot box,” Nick Clegg, Meta’s vice president of global affairs, wrote at the time.The company also said it would be adding “new guardrails” to ensure there are no “repeat offenders” who violate its rules, even if they are political candidates or world leaders.Facebook, the world’s largest social media site, had been both a publicly tool and a crucial source of fundraising revenue for both of Trump's previous campaigns.YouTube, in a tweet, announced earlier Friday that, “Starting today, the Donald J. Trump channel is no longer restricted and can upload new content.”“We carefully evaluated the continued risk of real-world violence, while balancing the chance for voters to hear equally from major national candidates in the run up to an election,” they wrote.Twitter also reinstated Trump's account last year after Elon Musk took over the company, but the former president has thus far chosen not to tweet.Instead, he has been posting frequently on his own Truth Social site, which he launched after the suspensions.",2023/3/18,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839341,"1st March Madness meeting for Duke, Tennessee in East Region","ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — Jon Scheyer once considered playing for Rick Barnes at Texas. Scheyer visited the Austin campus and toured the basketball facilities back in 2005 and even had a scholarship offer to join the Longhorns.“If I knew Kevin Durant was going there, I think I would have looked a little harder at it,” Scheyer said.It didn’t pan out, obviously. Scheyer landed at Duke, where he played and worked under Hall of Fame coach Mike Krzyzewski. Barnes spent the next 10 years at Texas — with little NCAA Tournament success — before taking over at Tennessee.Now, nearly two decades later, the 35-year-old Scheyer and the 68-year-old Barnes will square off in the second round of the NCAA Tournament when the fifth-seeded Blue Devils (27-8) play No. 4 Tennessee (24-10) in the East Region on Saturday. It’s the lone game in the East that day.It’s also the first NCAA Tournament matchup for two power programs with vastly different postseason resumes.Duke has made 45 appearances in the Big Dance, winning it all five times and getting to the Final Four 17 times. Tennessee is 1-7 in the Sweet 16 and has never reached the Final Four.The winner will advance to the regional semifinals in New York.“I think Jon could have gone anywhere he wanted to go, and he obviously picked Duke,” Barnes said. “And it’s worked out well for him. ... Always tough to follow what Mike did there. But Jon really has done a great job with this team.”Duke, the Atlantic Coast Conference Tournament champion, has won 10 in a row and dominated Oral Roberts in the opening round Thursday. Much of the team’s success has come since Scheyer moved Tyrese Proctor to point guard and freed up Jeremy Roach to play more in space.It also might be a coming-of-age story for a team that starts four freshmen: Proctor, Dereck Lively II, Mark Mitchell and Kyle Filipowski. Duke's turnaround started with a humbling loss at Miami in early February.“That was kind of a make-or-break moment for us in the season,” center Ryan Young said. “Could have gone a number of different ways. I was super proud of the way we came together and became more connected as a group.”Tennessee dropped six of its previous 10 games before holding off Louisiana-Lafayette in the opening round. The Volunteers didn’t do much right offensively, but they ratcheted up their defense down the stretch.The main improvement Barnes would like to see is reducing turnovers. The Vols had 18 against Louisiana, their second most this season and most since late November. It’s a product of being without point guard Zakai Zeigler, who tore a knee ligament late last month.“At this time of year, that’s probably the hardest position to overcome because of what his value is to us,” Barnes said. “We miss him, and he knows that. But we just said, ‘Hey, someone else is going to have to pick up some slack and more guys are going to have to contribute.’”ACADEMY CONNECTIONThe game will be a reunion for Tennessee’s Santiago Vescovi and Duke’s Tyrese Proctor. They overlapped in 2019 at the NBA Global Academy, an elite training center in Canberra, Australia.“I was surprised with him and a couple of other players younger than we were at that time how talented they were,” Vescovi said.PAOLO’S PLACEThe Blue Devils are playing on former Duke star Paolo Banchero’s home court. Banchero was the top pick in last summer’s NBA draft. He’s averaging 20.1 points, 6.7 rebounds and 3.6 rebounds for the Orlando Magic.Scheyer had hoped to connect with Banchero, but it hasn’t worked out with the Magic wrapping up a West Coast trip.“I know they had a tough one the other night,” Scheyer said. “But it’s all love, I can tell you that much.”RARE MATCHUPTennessee and Duke last played in the 2011 Maul Invitational, where the Blue Devils won 77-67. The teams have met just 15 times previously — Duke leads 8-7 — but just one of those came in the postseason. Duke topped the Vols 78-64 in the 1971 National Invitation Tournament.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/18,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839344,Kansas appeals court reinstates lawsuit over voting law,"The Kansas Court of Appeals on Friday reinstated a lawsuit that challenged provisions of a voting law enacted in 2021 that opponents argue is unconstitutional and limits voting rights.The lawsuit was filed in 2021 by Loud Light, the League of Women Voters of Kansas, the Topeka Independent Living Resource Center and the Kansas Appleseed Center for Law and Justice.They challenged provisions of a law passed by the Republican-controlled Legislature that limit how many advance mail ballots individuals can collect and require election officials to match the signatures on an advance ballot to a person’s voter registration record.Supporters of the law argued that restricting individuals from collecting and returning more than 10 advanced ballots per election would reduce “ballot harvesting” and limit voter fraud. Kansas Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly vetoed the measure, but lawmakers overrode her veto.The unanimous opinion Friday, written by Judge Stephen Hill, said the two provisions impair the right to vote.“It was by free elections that we gained statehood. Thus, voting rights are preserved in the Kansas Constitution,"" Hill wrote. ""Great care must be taken when trying to limit or infringe on those rights. Voting was important then. Voting is important now.”The court sent the lawsuit back to Shawnee County District Court Judge Teresa Watson, who originally dismissed it in April 2022 after finding the restrictions were reasonable. The ruling does not strike down the law. But it requires Watson to review the lawsuit using “strict scrutiny,” which is the highest standard of legal review.Attorney General Kris Kobach called the ruling “the most radical election law decision in the country.” He said the signature verification requirement protects people from having their votes stolen. He did not address the provision limiting the collection of ballots.“It is clearly wrong,” Kobach said in a statement. “The decision is directly contrary to what the U.S. Supreme Court has said, as well as what every state supreme court has said on the matter.”Davis Hammet, executive director of Loud Light, noted the ruling did not address whether the law is constitutional but said it was still a victory for voters.“It clarified the right to vote is a fundamental constitutional right and said when election laws are challenged the courts will apply the highest level of scrutiny to those laws,” Hammet said.Hammet said the ruling is especially important in the aftermath of baseless claims that the 2020 election was not valid, which prompted a wave of misinformation and voter suppression laws across the country.“What the court said here is (lawmakers) can’t just restrict the right to vote,” he said. “If you have a restriction, it has to be there for a compelling reason. You have to show you’re not just stopping people from voting or having their votes count.”Jacqueline Lightcap, co-president of the League of Women Voters of Kansas, said the ruling supports many arguments that voting advocates have been making since 2021.“We think the judge has some excellent points in saying voting is fundamental right and the earlier case was rushed out of district court,” Lightcap said. “We're very excited to have the chance to get it heard again.”Secretary of State Scott Schwab said his office was reviewing the decision but said it ""appeared to be a substantial change to the judicial standard of reviewing state election laws.”And Kansas House Speaker Dan Hawkins, a Republican from Wichita, called the decision “shocking” and said it endangers all current election integrity laws.“I am confident that Attorney General Kobach will swiftly appeal this egregious decision and Republicans in the House will support his efforts in every possible way,” Hawkins said.The Kansas Supreme Court heard arguments last month on another provision of the law, which makes it a crime to impersonate election officials. Opponents said the provision would make it difficult to conduct voter registration drives.",2023/3/18,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839348,"Police believe suspected cop killer shot Pizza employee, too","TORONTO (AP) — A 16-year-old who allegedly killed two police officers before shooting his mother and then killing himself is believed to have shot a Pizza Hut employee earlier in the week, an official familiar with the matter said Friday.Police said the teen shot the officers in the hall of his apartment early Thursday in Edmonton, Alberta, then struggled with his mother over the firearm before shooting her and killing himself.On Sunday, someone walked into a Pizza Hut a block from the apartment and shot an employee who survived. An official familiar with the matter told The Associated Press that police believe it is the same suspect. The official spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.Police said the male suspect in Thursday’s shooting previously received a mental health complaint that involved police. He did not have a criminal record, police said.Authorities said the officers were called to a family fight but there was no indication that the call was high risk or dangerous or that the teen had a gun.“When the two officers arrived, they were met by a 55-year-old female complainant outside of the complex. The two officers then responded to the suite where she resided, along with her 73-year-old male partner and their 16-year-old son,” police said in a statement.“Immediately upon arriving at the suite, both constables were shot multiple times by the 16-year-old male, and were immediately incapacitated. A struggle reportedly ensued between the mother and son over the firearm, and the suspect shot his mother before turning the firearm on himself, taking his own life. The father was not physically injured during the shootings.”Police said the mother remained unresponsive in a hospital and had not yet been talked to. The father is cooperating in the investigation, police said.Police identified the dead officers as Travis Jordan, 35, who had been with the Edmonton force for 8 1/2 years, and Brett Ryan, 30, an officer for 5 1/2 years.Edmonton police are also investigating a shooting earlier in the week at a nearby Pizza Hut. It is not known whether that is related.The killings were the first for the Edmonton Police Service since an officer was shot to death in 2015.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839349,Isak scores late as Newcastle beats Nottingham Forest 2-1,"NOTTINGHAM, England (AP) — Alexander Isak's stoppage-time penalty kept Newcastle's Champions League bid on track in a 2-1 comeback win against Nottingham Forest in the English Premier League on Friday.The Sweden international evened the score late in the first half after Emmanuel Dennis fired Forest in front at City Ground.Isak's late winner moved Newcastle to within a point of fourth-placed Tottenham with a game in hand on its rival for the last Champions League qualifying spot.The Magpies were five points clear of sixth-placed Liverpool, with Eddie Howe's team winning back-to-back league games for the first time since the turn of the year.Isak fired home from the spot in the third minute of stoppage time after Moussa Niakhate handled in the box.Forest took the lead in the 26th minute after Sven Botman's backpass was intercepted by Dennis, who dinked past Newcastle goalkeeper Nick Pope.The game was level by halftime after Isak volleyed in a cross from Joe Willock in the second minute of added time.Newcastle endured a troubled start to 2023 after looking like an improbable title challenger in the first half of the season.But the Saudi-backed club's bid to secure a place in the Champions League has been boosted by the wins against Wolverhampton last week and Forest.The late goal saw Forest beaten at the City Ground for the first time in the league since September and leaves the team just two points above the relegation zone,___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839350,Mormon Church gives water to boost imperiled Great Salt Lake,"SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Donating a small reservoir's worth of water rights to Utah's Great Salt Lake. Replacing grass with rocks and water-wise landscaping around neatly manicured churches. Reducing water use by more than one-third outside the headquarters in Salt Lake City's Temple Square. These are among the actions that the Utah-based Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is taking to address the realities of a rapidly approaching, drier future.Remarks from Bishop Christopher Waddell at the University of Utah on Friday underscored how the church — one of the biggest land and water rights holders in the western United States — is expanding its role in conservation and looking for solutions “that protect the future for all God's children.”“Our ability to be wise stewards of the earth is dependent on our understanding of the natural resources we have been blessed with,” the high-ranking church official said at a symposium on the future of the Great Salt Lake at the University of Utah’s S.J. Quinney College of Law.Speaking after a long list of scientists and Republican Gov. Spencer Cox, Waddell said the church's focus on stewardship spanned back to the Brigham Young era, noting that the faith's forefather endorsed what one historian said was a “radical notion” — that water is a public resource, not just a matter of private property rights.He said that the church was grateful for the wet winter — but unsurprised given the power of prayer — and urged members of the faith to conserve water and to not let the season's plentiful snowpack go to waste.The church's expanded role in Utah's conservation efforts comes as an increasing number of large institutions acknowledge additional actions will likely be needed to prepare for challenges ahead in the drought-stricken western United States. Yet it is also reigniting recurring questions from a growing chorus of environmentalists and scientists about whether the region's leaders — in business, politics and religion — are acting aggressively enough to confront drought and its looming consequences.An acre-foot is enough water to supply about two to three U.S. households for a year and the lake operates at a 1.2 million acre-foot deficit.Church officials announced earlier this week that they planned to donate roughly 20,000 acre-feet of water rights to the Great Salt Lake, which has shrunk to its lowest levels ever due to a supply-demand imbalance caused by decadeslong regional drought. The church has at least 75,000 acre-feet of active water rights, the Salt Lake Tribune reported in February.The church’s donation is roughly the size of a small reservoir and about 2% of what’s needed to keep the lake at its current level, according to research from a group of scientists led by Brigham Young University Ecologist Ben Abbott.“It’s a drop in the bucket on one level, but it’s also a big drop,” Abbott said of the church’s donation.Though there is less water now flowing through the rivers that have historically fed the lake, growing cities and farms continue to draw water, causing the lake's elevation to plummet. If the lake continues to shrink, it could risk being an ecological, economic and public health disaster; as more toxic dust is exposed on the shoreline, it will likely endanger native species, dirty the air in surrounding communities and reduce the “lake effect” snow that the state's ski industry relies on.Scientists worry that if the lake's current trajectory continues, the surrounding areas could become desolate wastelands like the areas surrounding parts of inland California's Salton Sea and the Owens Valley.Utah lawmakers have passed a variety of drought-related measures to make farming more efficient and to pay homeowners for replacing some grass. Yet they haven't advanced more drastic proposals on par with neighboring states, amid winter snowfall expected to temporarily stave off crises at both Lake Powell on the Utah-Arizona border and the Great Salt Lake.“Mother nature really helped us out,” Republican Sen. Scott Sandall said earlier this month. “We didn’t have to pull that lever for emergency use.”With scientists projecting that the lake could dry up in as soon as five years, demands have grown louder for lawmakers to commit to keeping the lake at a baseline elevation — and to consider more aggressive policies to ensure more water is delivered amid competing interests like municipal development and water intensive farms.Though lawmakers and state leaders laud conservation efforts underway, they still plan to dam the Bear River — the largest tributary feeding the Great Salt Lake — and the Lake Powell Pipeline, which would siphon water from the shrinking reservoir that stores Colorado River water for seven U.S. states and Mexico.“Our state leaders have failed to solve the Great Salt Lake crisis because they have turned their back on meaningful solutions to put water in the Lake,” Zach Frankel, the executive director of the Utah Rivers Council, said.On Friday, Cox was firm in rebutting the idea that political leaders aren't doing enough to save the Great Salt Lake. He cautioned scientists about the degree of certainty with which they present “doom and gloom” projections, and warned activists that the aggressive policy changes they seek could kindle fierce public backlash and jeopardize progress.“We are going faster than I ever thought we would go. But if we start confiscating farms and water shares, you will see politicians respond very quickly. People will run for office to make sure that we are not saving the Great Salt Lake,"" Cox said. ""They will be elected. Those are the types of things that you have to think through.""",2023/3/18,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839354,"Pegues, Furman hoping to extend March Madness stay","ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — JP Pegues has watched the shot over and over. A March Madness memory for Furman for all time.In Pegues' wildest dreams, he never imagined himself becoming an instant star. But the 6-foot-1 sophomore rocketed into notoriety when his 3-pointer took down No. 4 seed Virginia in the opening round of the NCAA Tournament.“It’s been at least 50 times I’ve watched that specific clip,” Pegues said Friday. “I was just so numb to the fact at first. I couldn’t believe it.”It began to sink in when his cell phone kept ringing and the team returned to a rousing reception at its hotel.Furman’s 68-67 victory — the school's first win in the tournament in 49 years — sent the 13th-seeded Paladins (28-7) into Saturday’s second round against San Diego State (28-6), the No. 5 seed in the South Region.Following Thursday's win, Furman players and fans celebrated at a hotel, and students partied back home in Greenville, South Carolina. Pegues stopped answering his phone long enough to enjoy the moment with teammates and family.“I started to realize how big the moment was. But I also noticed it wasn’t just totally me,"" Pegues said. ""I don’t want to consider the moment totally about me because at the end of day, I did make the shot but it was a team effort.”Teammate Mike Bothwell described Pegues as a laid-back guy who will need someone to escort him around campus from here on “because he’s going to get swarmed"" when the Paladins' tournament run ends.“I don’t know if you guys saw the videos from our campus. The support we had back in Greenville was amazing. ... Our student center was packed, people jumping into our lake,” Bothwell said.“That’s what makes this thing so fun and cool, how the school was really rallying behind us and having fun. So many people have texted me and said I’m getting tickets to come down Saturday.”Winning in its first NCAA Tournament appearance since 1980 thrust the small private college with an enrollment of 2,500 into the national spotlight on Thursday. The university's athletic Twitter account gained more than 1,000 followers overnight.Not that sports fans aren’t already familiar with an impressive list of famous Furman graduates that includes 90-year-old Frank Selvy, who set a Division I record that still stands by scoring 100 points in a game against Newberry on Feb. 13, 1954. Selvy, a two-time NBA All-Star, coached at his alma mater in the 1960s, and last fall was inducted into the college basketball Hall of Fame.Former NFL quarterback and coach Sam Wyche, PGA golfer Brad Faxon, soccer standouts Clint Dempsey and Walker Zimmerman, and LPGA golfers Betsy King, Beth Daniel, Sherri Turner and Dottie Pepper are Furman grads, too.Bothwell and Southern Conference Player of the Year Jalen Slawson are super seniors who together decided to return to school for a fifth year after Furman lost to Chattanooga on a buzzer-beater in the championship game of the Southern Conference tournament.It’s especially gratifying for them to finish their careers in the NCAA tourney.And now that Furman has its first win since beating South Carolina in the opening round in 1974, the Paladins are determined to prove they're not a one-shot wonder.Coach Bob Richey addressed the team after dinner Thursday night.“He was saying he didn’t want us to forget about this moment, but we’ll have that moment for the rest of our lives, to not hold on to it too long where we can’t focus on the next task ahead and miss out on the next opportunity,” Bothwell said.“We’re still enjoying it, still happy where we are. But we’ve got to be urgent and (prepare). We have a big task ahead of us (Saturday),” Bothwell added. “We kind of do those together. We’re urgent and have joy at the same time.”Richey, who is in his 12th season at Furman — sixth as head coach — is having a ball, too.“I woke up this morning just making sure I wasn’t at Disney and dreaming all this,” Richey said. “But it did happen, and we were a part of it. “___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/18,,World

(AP) — Forward Maddy Westbeld scored 20 points and led No. 3 seed Notre Dame to an 82-56 win over No. 14 seed Southern Utah in the first round of the women's NCAA Tournament.“I’m just ecstatic about this win,” coach Niele Ivey said. “It was such a dominant performance.”Guard Sonia Citron chipped in 14 points and a season-high six assists. The team’s leading scorer, she transitioned into the team’s primary facilitator with second-team Associated Press All-American guard Olivia Miles out the remainder of the season with an undisclosed knee injury.“The fact that (Citron) turned into that position — something that she’s never done before — it’s just remarkable and just shows you who she is as a player,” Ivey said. “She can receive information, and she translates it right away. She did an incredible job of pushing the pace.”Lauren Ebo had a double-double with 14 points and 10 rebounds.Megan Jensen led Southern Utah (23-10) with 11 points.“Notre Dame is a great team,” coach Tracy Sanders said. “We knew it was going to be a tough game. We knew they were big. I’m proud of our fight.”Notre Dame (26-5) faces No. 11 Mississippi State, which beat sixth-seeded Creighton.NEVER IN DOUBTNotre Dame jumped out to a 16-0 lead and kept its foot on the gas.“I thought it was imperative that we came out that way,” Ivey said. “We hadn’t played in two weeks.”The Irish held a 27-10 lead at the end of the first quarter, making 13 of 16 field goal attempts with 20 points in the paint. Westbeld led the way with eight points, while Ebo and Watson each scored six.DOMINANT DOWN LOWAfter a slow start, the Thunderbirds pivoted to a zone defense but still struggled to keep the Fighting Irish off the glass.“We had to finish it with boxouts and they got a couple of offensive rebounds,” Sanders said. “I thought they adjusted to it. I felt like it was better than us player-to-player trying to match up with them.”Notre Dame outrebounded undersized Southern Utah by a 53-25 margin, which included 21 offensive boards. The Fighting Irish scored 50 points in the paint to the Thunderbird’s 18.BIG PICTURESouthern Utah: Saw its magical 2022-23 season end. The Thunderbirds won the Western Athletic Conference Tournament title and earned the program’s first-ever NCAA Tournament berth.“We made history over at Southern Utah and they’ve set the standard and left a legacy,” Sanders said.” I’m just really proud of this group.”Notre Dame: The ACC regular season champs look to make their second straight Sweet Sixteen appearance.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/18,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839357,France: Pension reform spells crisis for Macron,"It was an extraordinary scene that epitomized the political storm France has walked into.As Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne was making her way to the National Assembly's podium Thursday afternoon, lawmakers from the opposition stood up, chanting the Marseillaise and holding signs saying ""no to 64 years"" and ""democracy.""The Assembly's president interrupted the session for things to calm down.But when Borne took the floor a few minutes later, she still had to drown out the parliamentarians' boos.""Based on article 49.3 of the constitution, I engage the government's responsibility,"" she yelled, announcing that a controversial pension reform increasing France's minimum retirement age from 62 to 64 years would be pushed through without a vote in the lower house of parliament.Paragraph 3 of Article 49 allows the prime minister to act unilaterally. The only way to stop a bill that was passed under this rule would be to bring down the government.""What happened was absolutely unheard of ― it was terrible to see how the National Assembly went completely crazy,"" Bruno Cautres from Paris-based think tank Centre for Political Research told DW.Headwinds against what was by many perceived as an authoritarian move were also blowing outside the parliament, following weeks of protests against the pension reform.Thousands of demonstrators took to the streets of Paris and other cities across the country, some of them staying late into the night and clashing with riot police. Further protests are expected over the weekend.""This highlights that something's not right in the French political system ― we can see that in our regular polls, which show that people want a more participative democracy where unions and civil society are involved in the elaboration of legal texts,"" Cautres said.Opposition parties have filed two no-confidence motions that will be put to the vote on Monday.The French government has received the support of the leaders of the conservative Republicans. Their 60 votes would give President Emmanuel Macron's minority coalition the needed majority to fend off the no-confidence votes.And yet, the same leaders had already pledged their party's backing for the pension reform. But not enough Republicans agreed to follow that lead, which is why President Macron deemed a parliamentary majority for his reform unlikely and decided to trigger the 49.3.Vincent Martigny, a professor for political science at Nice University and Paris-based Ecole Polytechnique, thinks the move has plunged France into a political crisis that is here to stay, at least in the medium term.While President Macron's job is not directly threatened, running the country seems set become a headache.""The government in its current form is fatally injured, just like during a corrida, a bullfight,"" Martigny said to DW, adding that PM Borne would almost certainly have to step down.""If one of the no-confidence votes gets through, the government will fall and the president is likely to dissolve the National Assembly,"" Martigny said.""If the government survives the vote, Macron can either withdraw the reform, which seems highly unlikely, or stick to it, which will spark a social crisis with consequences unknown that could include snap parliamentary elections,"" he added.The president, meanwhile, argues France needs the reform to maintain its financial credibility on international markets, where it refinances its debt that stands at about 110 percent of France's GDP.""I consider that the financial and economic risks [of not carrying out the reform] are too big,"" Macron said in front of the cabinet on Thursday, as per a statement from his office.""But as opposed to people in countries like Germany, the French don't care about public debt – for them, it's a side issue,"" Martigny underlined.The pension system, by contrast, lies at the heart of their concerns.""The French practice what I'd call welfare nationalism ― they are very attached to their system of redistribution and consider it as a crucial part of their identity,"" Martigny said.He added that even in politically stable times, it was a challenge to carry out welfare reforms in France.""But we are in dire economic times with a war in Ukraine and rising inflation. On top of that, Macron has hardly negotiated with the unions and wants to push the reform through by force,"" Martigny said. ""All this is causing a huge uproar.""Cautres from the Centre for Political Research thinks the only way for Macron to get back into calmer political waters in the medium term is to reach a majority in parliament.""Either he forms a stable coalition agreement with the Republicans or he dissolves the National Assembly hoping for a better result in the subsequent parliamentary elections,"" the expert said.But Benjamin Morel, a political analyst and lecturer for public law at University Paris 2 Panthéon-Assas, doubts these strategies will work.""The Republicans are not reliable partners ― they seem to be a group of free electrons without much party discipline,"" he told DW.And snap parliamentary elections could harbor another risk.""The far right is likely to gain ground, as it has managed to build up a respectable image during the debates in parliament while being against the reform and on the side of the people. And democratic fatigue, as we are seeing it now, often leads to either abstention or a vote for the extremes,"" Morel said.Edited by: Carla Bleiker",2023/3/17,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839358,Croatian author Dubravka Ugresic dies in Amsterdam,"Dubravka Ugresic, the Croatian essayist and novelist, died in Amsterdam aged 73 Friday, Croatian media reported.The Croatan news agency Hina announced her death, citing Multimedijalni Institut in Zagreb, her native language publisher.Ugresic was known for her criticism of the nationalism and chauvinism that fractured her native Yugoslavia and for her lyrical writings on the exiie experience.The fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of Yugoslavia hugely influenced the course of her life and works.Under Franjo Tudjman, President and founder of the post-Yugoslav Croatian state, Croatian state media launched propaganda campaigns against Ugresic, portraying her as a traitor to the nationalist cause.She left Croatia in 1993 and later lived in the US and, since 1996, in Amsterdam in the Netherlands.Her novel, ""The Ministry of Pain,"" received international acclaim. Her writings focused on the course of late 20th century history and the influence of big events on the lives of individuals.In 1999, she received the Austrian state literature prize. The following year, the Berlin Academy of the Arts awarded Heinrich Mann Prize.In 2009, she was a finalist for the Mann Booker Prize.After she received an award in her native Croatia for the best novel in 2018, she called for more multiculturalism.For the past three years, she was mentioned as a contender for the Nobel Prize for Literature.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839359,Videos show tense standoff before fatal NJ police shooting,"TRENTON, N.J. (AP) — A five-hour-long standoff between police in Paterson, New Jersey, and a well-known anti-violence worker in the city — that ended with officers fatally shooting him in his brother's apartment — began with sobbing pleas from the man’s mother to end the ordeal.Details released this week by the New Jersey attorney general's office, including hours of body-camera footage from seven officers as well as seven 911 recordings, provide the most comprehensive account yet of the March 3 standoff that ended with the death of Najee Seabrooks.Seabrooks, 31, was a crisis intervention worker and mentor with the nonprofit Paterson Healing Collective and died soon after police shot him when he emerged with a knife from the apartment bathroom where he was holed up, according to the attorney general's office.“I’m your mother — why you doing this?” Seabrooks' mother called out in one video. “Najee, stop because I am your mother. Open the door. Open the door, Najee.” Seabrooks' response is inaudible in the video.Long accustomed to helping others in the mid-sized city 20 miles (32 kilometers) northwest of New York, Seabrooks' co-workers have been shattered by his death and say authorities prevented them from using their mental-health expertise to deescalate the situation.It's also led to the state attorney general's office investigating the shooting, as required under state law, as well as a public outcry for a Justice Department investigation into the city's police department.Seabrooks called 911 just before 8 a.m., telling the dispatcher that he needed immediate help because someone was making death threats against him and that he needed an escort to his car. He called dispatchers a half-dozen more times, with the responders telling him that police were already dispatched.The videos show officers arriving, introducing themselves and offering to get him water. He asks to speak with a sergeant, who soon arrives and asks him to come out of the bathroom. “What's going on, my love,” the sergeant says when she arrives.Seabrooks is hard to hear in some of the video, but the sergeant asks, “How do you want to go about hurting yourself?”“I got a gun on me,” he said.“You got a gun and two knives?” the sergeant asks.Tension increased at that point.Over the next roughly four hours, more police file into the apartment. According to the attorney general's office, there were crisis negotiators, emergency medical personnel as well as Paterson police officers.At one point water can be heard and seen flooding into the apartment hallway from the bathroom. A fire alarm goes off, as officers realize a fire had apparently been set. Later, the bathroom door is open, and Seabrooks appears shirtless.Officers fired 15 nonlethal projectiles at him, according to the attorney general's office. One officer says in a video that Seabrooks had been cutting himself.“Just let me die,"" Seabrooks is heard saying. “I’m dying slow.”An officer responds: “No, come on. I want to help you.”The videos and calls have been redacted, with the videos frequently obscured by whatever the officer is carrying.Some of Seabrooks final moments flash in one partially obscured clip. Still in the bathroom, he asks to speak to his mother, and an officer tells him that they can bring her to him.“Naj, come on, man. Let's take you to your mom,"" the officer said. “I'm sure she don't want to see you like this.”Seabrooks came out of the bathroom the next instant.“Drop it,” the officer yelled as shots rang out.Seabrooks was taken to St. Joseph's Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead just over five hours after the first 911 call.His death has rattled his co-workers, who were at the scene and texting with him, Seabrooks' boss at the Paterson Healing Collective Liza Chowdhury said Friday in a phone interview. She said Seabrooks had been texting with colleagues, asking to see them, but that police blocked the co-workers from entering the apartment.“We help so many people and then when our team member needed help we were declined from doing what we do,” she said.She added: “That was clearly a mental health call. In mental health situations. It requires patience, empathy and asking what the person needs.”In the two weeks since Seabrooks' death, anti-violence advocates have organized a vigil calling for a number of reforms, including the creation of a civilian review board. The New Jersey Institute for Social Justice has called on the Justice Department to investigate the city's police department, and the ACLU of New Jersey said the shooting shows the need to invest in non-law enforcement responses to mental health calls.Messages seeking comment were left with the Paterson mayor and director of public safety.New Jersey began requiring the state attorney general to investigate fatal encounters involving police in 2019, including presenting evidence to a grand jury.The attorney general's office said in a statement that the investigation continues and no other information is being released.",2023/3/18,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839361,MATCHDAY: Kompany back to face Man City in FA Cup,"A look at what’s happening in European soccer on Saturday:ENGLANDVincent Kompany brings Burnley to Etihad Stadium to play Manchester City in the FA Cup quarterfinals. The former City captain has the second-division club on the verge of promotion in his first season as its manager. Erling Haaland scored five goals in City's 7-0 rout of Leipzig midweek in the Champions League. The three other quarterfinals will be played on Sunday. Among the five Premier League games on tap, Tottenham can bolster its top-four credentials when it visits last-placed Southampton. Brentford hosts slumping Leicester, which has lost five straight games overall including four in the league. Bournemouth plays at Aston Villa. Leeds will be without injured midfielder Tyler Adams for a trip to Wolverhampton. In the evening match, Chelsea looks to continue its hot streak when Everton goes to Stamford Bridge. Graham Potter's expensive squad has won three in a row overall.SPAINAtletico Madrid hosts Valencia on a nine-game unbeaten streak in the league. A third straight win would strengthen its hold on third place and let it start believing it can catch Real Madrid in second. The game comes a day before Madrid, which is eight points ahead, visits leader Barcelona. Valencia is seeking a second straight win to help it move further away from the relegation zone. Espanyol striker Joselu Mato can add to his 12 league goals against Celta Vigo a day after he was named to Spain’s squad for the first time. Rayo Vallecano hosts Girona, and Cadiz faces Almeria in a clash of teams in danger of the drop.GERMANYBorussia Dortmund is under pressure to win against Cologne after dropping points last week in a draw at lowly Schalke and dropping two points behind Bundesliga leader Bayern Munich as a result. Dortmund remains without Julian Brandt after his injury in the Champions League loss to Chelsea last week. Karim Adeyemi remains out, too. Leipzig returns to action against Bochum after its crushing 7-0 loss to Manchester City, while Stuttgart hosts Wolfsburg and Augsburg plays in-form Schalke. Hoffenheim's American coach Pellegrino Matarazzo is under pressure after losing his first five games in charge. They take on Hertha Berlin.ITALYZlatan Ibrahimović could make his first start of the season when AC Milan visits Udinese. The 41-year-old Ibrahimović has made three substitute appearances as he recovers from knee surgery last May. Fourth-placed Milan would move to second with a win, in a tight race for the Champions League spots in Serie A. It beat Udinese 4-1 in August. At the other end of the table, relegation-threatened Cremonese visits Monza. Cremonese is 12 points from safety. Salernitana also needs the points as it is only seven points above the relegation zone and it hosts Bologna. Boths sides had impressive results in the last round against top-four teams; Salernitana drew at Milan 1-1 and Bologna held Lazio to 0-0.FRANCEChampions League-chasing Lens can move into second place with a home win against rock-bottom Angers, which has not won a league game since Sept. 18. Second spot guarantees automatic qualification for the Champions League and a win would move Lens one point above Marseille. In another game, Canada striker Jonathan David looks to add to his 19 league goals when Lille goes south to face mid-table Toulouse. A win would move Lille up to fifth place.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/18,,World

I think he carried the weight of getting us out of the first round, I think, a little bit too much in the first half.”Iona (27-8) had its 14-game winning streak snapped as the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference champion didn't have the depth to keep up with one of the Big East's best for 40 minutes.“The played a great second half,” Pitino said. “They physically dominated us at the five spot. And the first half was just about as well as we played all year.”Walter Clayton Jr. led the Gaels with 14 points.Now the question is: What's next for the Gaels' Hall of Fame coach?“I really don’t have an answer to it, to be honest with you,” Pitino said when asked if this was his last game at Iona. “I have no idea if it is or isn’t, because I’ve focused everything on this game.”Pitino was coaching in his 24th NCAA Tournament and maybe his last with Iona, the tiny Catholic school in New Rochelle, New York, that brought him back to the college game even with an NCAA investigation hanging over him.The 70-year-old seems to be in line for another high-profile job, with St. John’s as the apparent front-runner to land the two-time national champion.UConn trailed by a two at the half, but came out of the break clicking. A four-point play by Jordan Hawkins immediately gave the Huskies the lead.“I believe that play gave them all the momentum and got them going,” Iona's Berrick JeanLouis said.Then Sanogo went to work inside.The 6-foot-9, 245-pound junior had a dunk, a hook, a couple of layups and two free throws, scoring of 10 of the Huskies' next 13 points as they grabbed a 54-43 lead.“Definitely, coming into this game, there was a lot of pressure,” Sanogo said.The Gaels never really threatened again. Sanogo's turnaround jumper from the baseline with 6:49 left made it 71-57 and the Huskies cruised into the second round for the first time since 2016.Hawkins added 13 points, all in the second half, and Sanogo capped his 13-for-17 shooting performance with a long-range jumper to beat the shot clock with 3:05 left to up the lead to 21. He also had 13 rebounds.Donovan Clingan, UConn's 7-2 backup center, added 12 points and nine rebounds.“We've won the most games in the Big East the last three years overall,” Hurley said. “We were able to transfer that into a first round game of the NCAA Tournament, which I'm excited about.”Pitino came in with a 54-20 NCAA record, but without a tournament victory since 2017, his last season at Louisville before he was fired amid the second NCAA scandal of his tenure.Pitino was exonerated — which he reminded everyone about at his postgame news conference — when the final ruling was handed down just before the start of this season, leading to speculation bigger schools would come calling when Iona's season ended.For a half, it looked like that might be at least another few days.The pace was brisk and the play was sharp from the start, a first-round matchup that felt a little like a regional final.Pitino was dapper and active on the sideline in his black suit and silver tie. And the Gaels were fearless in the first half.They pressured ballhandlers and played at a pace that had to feel familiar to Louisville and Kentucky fans who rooted for Pitino’s best teams.Neither team led by more than four in the first 20 minutes and Iona’s 6-3 Daniss Jenkins seemed to send a message in the final minute when he came swooping in for an emphatic block on Clingan to keep the Gaels in front, 39-37 at the break.UConn, however, had the final response.BIG PICTUREIona: The Gaels fell to 1-16 all-time in the tournament, with their only victory coming in 1980 under the late Jim Valvano against Holy Cross.UConn: Hurley, in his fifth season at UConn, talked openly about the pressure to advance this week after going one-and-done in the tournament the last two years.Pitino thinks the ceiling is high for the Huskies.“They've got all the metrics to win a national championship,” Pitino said.UP NEXTIona: Maybe a new coach?UConn: The Huskies won their only meeting against Saint Mary's in 2006.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839363,Spring training's loss is WBC's gain as viewership jumps,"SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) — Many of Major League Baseball's biggest stars, like Mike Trout, Mookie Betts and Shohei Ohtani, aren't playing in spring training. They're in the World Baseball Classic.Some baseball fans, particularly New York Mets fans, aren't sure that's a good thing.But one thing appears certain: People are watching.The fifth WBC tournament drew just over 1 million fans in the first round, according to numbers released Friday from MLB. That was up from about 500,000 in 2017. Part of the reason is there are more games since the tournament was expanded to 20 teams from 16.But this year's average attendance of 25,275 is considerably higher than the 20,402 average in 2017.Several individual games were among the highlights. Mexico beat the United States 11-5 in front of 47,534 fans at Chase Field in Phoenix, which set the WBC attendance record for a first-round game.The games at the Tokyo Dome in Japan drew an average of 36,198 per game — a record for any site in the first or second round.Also of note:1. The Japan vs. Korea game last week on TBS drew a 44.4 rating in Japan to make it the most-watched game in one country in the history of the WBC. The game beat all events during the Tokyo Olympics.2. MLB says that it has already broken the tournament's merchandise sales record, even though there are games still being played.Of course, not everything went well in the first round. Mets closer Edwin Díaz suffered a torn patellar tendon and is expected to miss the entire season after hurting his right knee while celebrating Puerto Rico's victory over the Dominican Republic.The risk of injury has historically kept many MLB players out of the WBC. Díaz's freak injury adds more fuel to that argument. Los Angeles Dodgers star Freddie Freeman suffered a hamstring injury while playing for Canada, but it doesn't appear to be significant.Díaz, who turns 29 next week, retired the side in order in the ninth inning of the 5-2 victory on Wednesday night that sent Puerto Rico to the quarterfinals. As Díaz and his teammates jumped together in the infield, the right-hander collapsed and reached for his right leg.CLEVINGER RAMPS UPNew Chicago White Sox right-hander Mike Clevinger made his second start of the spring against the Cubs. He threw 65 pitches, giving up three runs over 3 2/3 innings.Clevinger, 32, signed a $12 million, one-year contract with the White Sox in December to join a starting rotation including Lance Lynn and Dylan Cease.“I made some mechanical adjustments and moved to the third base side of the rubber. I’m more in tune with the arm angle I had in 2019 and 2020,” said Clevinger, who won 13 games for Cleveland in 2018 and 2019.Clevinger had Tommy John surgery late in 2020 and missed all of 2021. He spent last season with the San Diego Padres and had a 4.33 ERA over 114 1/3 innings.Clevinger got a late start in spring training because of domestic abuse allegations. MLB said on March 5 that Clevinger would not face discipline.In a statement, the commissioner’s office said its investigation included interviews of more than 15 people, including Clevinger and a woman who said she is the mother of Clevinger’s child, as well as thousands of electronic communications and other documents.When he reported to spring training, Clevinger apologized for being a distraction and told reporters he was confident he would be exonerated.GONSOLIN TO MISS OPENING DAYDodgers manager Dave Roberts told reporters Friday that right-hander Tony Gonsolin won’t be ready for opening day because of a sprained ankle.The 28-year-old had his best season in 2022 — earning his first All-Star nod in the process — and finished with a 16-1 record and 2.14 ERA in 130 1/3 innings while giving up just 79 hits.The Dodgers have several options to fill Gonsolin’s spot. The most likely candidates are Ryan Pepiot, Michael Grove and Andre Jackson.SEATTLE'S MOORE HURTThe Seattle Mariners will be without utility infielder Dylan Moore to start the regular season due to an oblique strain.Moore had an MRI that revealed a Grade 1 strain of his left oblique, the team said. Moore is expected to be shut down for at least a few weeks before ramping up his baseball activity again.Moore was slated to make his spring training debut on Thursday but was a late scratch from the lineup after straining the oblique while taking some swings in the morning. Moore had been slowly brought along during spring training after undergoing core muscle surgery in the offseason.Moore was expected to have a larger role for Seattle this season serving as a regular backup for Kolten Wong at second base and J.P. Crawford at shortstop, particularly against left-handed pitching.He hit .224 with six homers and 24 RBIs last season while playing seven different positions.ROYALS SIGN BRENTZThe Royals signed left-hander Jake Brentz to a two-year deal Friday that includes $850,000 this season, when the reliever is mostly expected to be recovering from Tommy John surgery, and $1.05 million next season.Kansas City had designated Brentz for assignment in November and he chose to become a free agent. His signing fills out their 40-man roster, though he is expected to go on the 60-day injured list before opening day.The 28-year-old was 5-2 with a 3.66 ERA in 72 appearances for Kansas City in 2001. But he only appeared in eight games last season before landing on IL and eventually having Tommy John surgery in July.METS CLAIM SANTANAThe New York Mets claimed right-handed pitcher Dennis Santana off waivers from the Minnesota Twins.The 26-year-old appeared in 63 games with the Texas Rangers last season, finishing with a 3-8 record and 5.22 ERA.___AP Sports Writers Dave Skretta and Tim Booth, and freelance writer Gary Schatz, contributed to this report.___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839364,Michigan women end UNLV's 22-game win streak in 1st round,"BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) — Emily Kiser leads Michigan, by far, in the basketball equivalent of football helmet stickers for the number of winning plays she's made this season — from diving for loose balls to taking charges.There are more than 40 stickers in her locker now, according to coach Kim Barnes Arico — more than double the number of any teammate. And there will be more to come before the women's NCAA Tournament is over.Kiser had 18 points and 10 rebounds, Maddie Nolan added 18 points, and sixth-seeded Michigan beat 11th-seeded UNLV 71-59 in the first round on Friday, snapping the Rebels' 22-game winning streak.“Our team had a little bit of a chip on their shoulder,” said Barnes Arico, whose team had entered the tournament having lost three of four. ""We lost a couple games down the stretch but we weren't completely healthy.“With everyone back, I think our players really have that confidence,” added Barnes Arico, whose team made the Elite Eight last season. “They also have that experience.”Leigha Brown scored 17 points for the Wolverines (23-9), who used their advantages in size and physicality to build and keep a double-digit lead for much of their opening game in the Greenville 2 region.UNLV ""didn’t see the defense we play with — and the Big Ten plays with — night in and night out,"" Brown said. “We knew that if were aggressive and punched first, it was going to be really hard for them to get into sets that they want.”The Wolverines will face third-seeded LSU in the second round.UNLV (31-3) came up one short of the longest winning streak in program history. Its Mountain West Tournament title victory had tied a mark reached previously in the 1978-79 and 1989-90 seasons.“I couldn't be more proud of the season that we've had,” UNLV coach Lindy La Rocque said. “Obviously this one stings and it's going to be with us for a little bit.”The Rebels came in unbeaten (27-0) when scoring 69 or more points — a total they could not reach against a Michigan team that outrebounded them 41-31.Essence Booker scored 16 points for UNLV, while Justice Ethridge and Desi-Rae Young each scored 11.Booker said the Rebels were in some of their worst form this season to start the game.“It looked like a practice we came to off of vacation,” she said, but added, “I am going to hold my head high, just because I am proud of what we've done and this loss doesn't dictate all the things that we've done and made history in our program.”Michigan took the lead for good when guard Laila Phelia's offensive rebound set up Brown's second-chance layup to make it 9-7 in the first quarter.The Wolverines led by as many as 13 points in the second quarter before Kenadee Winfrey and Ethridge each hit 3s during an 8-0 run that helped UNLV get as close as five points.Michigan led 28-20 at halftime. The Wolverines took a 17-point lead when Kiser scored eight points on a free throw, two layups and a 3 during a 12-0 run that made it 48-31 late in the third period. UNLV only got as close as nine points after that.“We really take (defense) into our identity,” Kiser said. “In the first half, when we weren't scoring, we were trying to get those stops — and that has to be your mindset.”CRASHING THE BOARDSWearing a brace on her left knee and playing in her third game since missing seven with a leg injury, Phelia exerted her influence on the game defensively. She grabbed career-high 11 rebounds to go with her eight points — less than half of her scoring average of 16.9.“The biggest thing for me was just understanding that I’m still trying to get in the offensive swing of things, missing a lot of games, I’m still trying to get in the flow of stuff,” Phelia said. “So, I thought to myself, ‘OK, what can I do to help our team?’ And that was rebounding.“I feel like once I put my mind to something that I can accomplish it,” Phelia added, “and I wanted to help the team in that way.”BIG PICTUREUNLV: Shot 28% (7 of 25) from 3-point range, well below its season-low average of 33.8% coming in. ... Shot 38% (23 of 60) overall, also well below its 46.3% average for the season.Michigan: Converted 12 offensive rebounds into 13 second-chance points. ...

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839365,UCLA's Kiki Rice AP Diary: excited to play in March Madness,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — It's finally here, my chance to play in March Madness.I grew up a huge college basketball fan, watching the NCAA Tournament and college games all the time. I used to do NCAA pools when I was younger and did pretty well. I took them seriously and made my brackets based off what I had seen throughout the season. I admit I did pretty well and usually ended up on the winning side of things.While I can't do brackets pools anymore, I still am watching the men's games. My roommates and I cheered on the men's team from our dorm room the other night. Gabriela's (Jaquez) brother plays on the men's team and we were screaming at the TV rooting them on.Now it's our turn to play in March Madness and it's an awesome feeling. I'm excited to play in front of our home fans and it should be a great atmosphere.It's not the easiest thing having the last game of the first round as I'll be hyped up from watching the games earlier day, but it's cool that we close out the first round of the tournament.One of the biggest reasons I came across the country to UCLA was to take a team that hasn't been to the Final Four and a championship to new heights. I wanted to come to a place where we could compete in March Madness every year and make deep runs in the tournament.I didn't expect college basketball to be easy coming in and it's been a little bit harder than I had thought as a freshmen. There have been ups and downs and growing pains to go through and you have to get used to playing at this level. In high school and in AAU there was smooth sailing for the most part. I've faced new adversities this year that I hadn't felt before, but also I think that has been the most fun I've had in my career so far.On the court we’ve been really locked in this week getting ready for the game. I’ve noticed everyone is paying a lot more attention to details and practices have been really competitive this week. It’s the best week we’ve had all season.It's not all basketball, though, right now. UCLA is on the quarter system and we're actually in final exams. I have a bunch of papers and other things to turn in over the next few days. Luckily I have no in person exams, but still have a lot of work to do.Despite it being the most exciting time of year on the court, our professors still hold us to the high standards they should off the court. Shout out to my English professor who is a big fan of the team. He's come to a few of our game so far this season and hopefully he and the entire class will show up Saturday for the opener.The first 100 students get in free, so I'm hoping that a lot of them show up.Go Bruins!___UCLA freshman Kiki Rice is checking in periodically during the NCAA Tournament.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839366,"Schenk getting results in 10th straight week, leads Valspar","PALM HARBOR, Fla. (AP) — Adam Schenk is playing for the 10th consecutive week on the PGA Tour and finally seeing some good results, making enough putts Friday for a 2-under 69 that gave him a one-shot lead going into the weekend at the Valspar Championship.Schenk had four birdies, all but one of them from inside 10 feet, and finished with a bogey from the bunker short of the 18th on the Copperhead course at Innisbrook.That didn't bother him too much because of the 20-foot putt he made for par on the par-3 eighth, the 10-footer for par he made on the 10th and the long up-and-down for par on the par-5 11th.“I feel like a lot of times you ... maybe shoot 2 under and you're like, ‘It could have been 6 or 7.’ But it really couldn't have been a ton better with the amount of putts I made,” he said.He was at 7-under 135, one shot ahead of Kramer Hickok, who had a 68.Jordan Spieth is a big part of the weekend, wasting a great round of driving with some suspect short irons. He still posted a 70 and was only two shots behind.Also part of the weekend is Nick Gabrelcik, who grew up about 10 miles away and is a regular at the Valspar Championship — working the range, carrying signs, caddying in the pro-am. Now the University of North Florida junior is in the field on a sponsor exemption.Gabrelcik, who lost in the semifinals at Oakmont in the 2021 U.S. Amateur, opened with a 75 and responded with a 67 to easily make the cut. He was at even-par 142.“Going into the round I was like, ‘We got nothing to lose, we’re 4 over, so let’s just go out and have fun.’ Maybe it’s the last round, maybe it’s not,” Gabrelcik said. ""Got the putter going early, made four birdies my first five holes and was like, ‘All right, let’s just keep it together, let’s not play defensive now.’“It's an awesome feeling making my first cut.”Also making the cut was Ludwig Aberg, the No. 1 amateur in the world. Aberg also played the weekend at Bay Hill.Tommy Fleetwood had a 69 and joined Spieth in the group two shots behind along with Cody Gribble (65) and Davis Riley (68), who lost in a playoff to Sam Burns at Innisbrook last year.Burns, the two-time defending champion, is trying to become the first player to win the same tournament three straight years since Steve Stricker at the John Deere Classic (2009-11). He had a 73 and was seven shots behind.Justin Thomas had a 70 and was in the group at 3-under 139.Schenk had had a few close calls in search of his first victory, such as the Shriners Children's Open in Las Vegas in 2021 and the Barracuda Championship the same year.He plays a lot, anyway, but there's a little more emphasis this year because his wife is expecting their first child, a boy, in a little over a month.“Trying to make as many points as I can to take as much time off as I can and spend time with him and my wife, which will be very special,” Schenk said.He started his year in Honolulu at the Sony Open and hasn't had a week off since then, going to California and Arizona, and every stop on the Florida swing. He had made the cut in all but two of them and is No. 72 in the FedEx Cup.The missed cut last week at The Players Championship might have helped.“I was home for 3 1/2 days and didn’t touch a club,” Schenk said. “I would have practiced, but the weather was so bad in Indiana, I really couldn’t. So flew into Valspar Tuesday afternoon and got a little practice in and then played nine holes and then teed up in the pro-am and away we went.”The cut was at 1-over 143. Among those missing was U.S. Open champion Matt Fitzpatrick, who has missed the cut three times in his last six tournament. Fitzpatrick took a 9 on the third hole of the opening round and never caught up.Harry Higgs had the latest big number. He took an 8 on the par-3 13th hole when he went into the water, and then over the green from the drop area into a bunker, and then blasted out into the water. Higgs had two double bogeys and wound up with an 81.___AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/18,,World

(AP) — The Kansas City Chiefs added two more pieces to their rapidly evolving defense Friday by agreeing to terms with former Buccaneers safety Mike Edwards III and former Chargers linebacker Drue Tranquill on one-year deals, a person familiar with the negotiations told The Associated Press.The person spoke on condition of anonymity because their contracts were still pending physicals.The two moves came after the Chiefs released defensive end Frank Clark to create some salary cap space and signed Charles Omenihu, who had been with the 49ers last season, to replace him on a two-year, $16 million contract.Edwards should help in the secondary alongside safety Eric Reid in the spot created when Juan Thornhill agreed to a deal with the Browns this offseason. Edwards was a third-round pick of Tampa Bay in the 2019 draft and started a career-high 12 of the 13 games he played last season, making 82 tackles while picking off two passes and returning one for a score.Tranquill was a fourth-round pick of the AFC West-rival Chargers in the same draft. He's coming off his best season, too, leading the team with 146 tackles along with five sacks and an interception in the regular season and another in the playoffs.Earlier in the day, the Chiefs re-signed backup offensive lineman Nick Allegretti to a one-year deal.The Chiefs also confirmed numerous changes to their coaching staff, Friday including the promotion of Matt Nagy from offensive assistant and quarterbacks coach to replace the departed Eric Bieniemy as offensive coordinator, and the elevation of Joe Bleymaier from wide receivers coach to the pass game coordinator.Connor Embree will take over wide receivers after serving as an offensive quality control coach; Todd Pinkston will handle running backs after coaching wide receivers at Austin Peay; Porter Ellett will be the assistant running backs coach after he was an offensive quality control coach; David Girardi went from pass game analyst to replace Nagy as the quarterbacks coach; Kevin Saxton was added as an offensive assistant; and Dan Williams was moved to offensive quality control.""For the first time in a while, we had some movement on the coaching staff,” Chiefs coach Andy Reid said. “I’m excited to see what these coaches can do in their new roles. They are all talented individuals with unique skillsets.

(AP) — Georgia Amoore scored 22 points, Elizabeth Kitley added 12, and top-seeded Virginia Tech rolled to a 58-33 victory over No. 16 seed Chattanooga on Friday in the first round of the NCAA Tournament’s Seattle Region.Kitley added 14 rebounds while Amoore hit five 3-pointers for the Hokies (28-4), who won their 12th consecutive game.“We were a little bit rusty, which I felt like we were going to be,” Virginia Tech coach Kenny Brooks said. “Twelve-day layoff, kids in and out of the lineup. But it’s always good to get a win to start everything and then to keep it going. The old adage is to survive and advance. You want to be a little bit better than that. But we’re fortunate to be able to get a win today.”Yazz Wazeerud-Din and Raven Thompson led Chattanooga (20-13) with 10 points each. The Moccasins were held to their lowest point total of the season.Virginia Tech, which is making its third consecutive NCAA Tournament appearance, never trailed. The Hokies led by one late in the first quarter, but used a 17-0 run bridging the first and second quarters to pull away. Amoore scored eight points in that run.“They had 33 points, but we all know that our defense could have been even better,” Kitley said. “Sometimes they were able to dictate what they wanted to do more than we should have let them. They did have (just) 33 points, but we all know that we can be better. We need to be better.”Chattanooga, which was making its first NCAA Tournament appearance since 2017, struggled against an aggressive Virginia Tech defense. The Moccasins made just six field goals in the first half and shot 28.6% (14 of 49) for the game.“Tonight, Virginia Tech was a better team,” said Chattanooga coach Shawn Poppie, who spent six years as an assistant under Brooks at Virginia Tech. “They’re a really good basketball team over there and we knew coming in we had our hands full. I thought we did a really good job at times defensively, and they were stifling. It was hard to get good looks, and the ones we did get, we just couldn’t get into any, any runs. We couldn’t put anything together. So congratulations to Coach Brooks and Virginia Tech.”Kayana Traylor had 12 points, and Taylor Soule finished with 10 for the Hokies, who shot 47.9% (23 of 48).TIP-INSChattanooga: The Moccasins had a great season under first-year coach Shawn Poppie, winning 20 games and taking the Southern Conference tournament championship. Before taking over, he was an assistant for Kenny Brooks at Virginia Tech. The Mocs return most of their roster heading into next season and will be a contender to win the league title again.Virginia Tech: Virginia Tech’s offense gets the accolades, but its defense has been its strength in its 12-game winning streak. The Hokies have held eight consecutive opponents to under 41% shooting from the floor and 11 of 12.“We’re not going to try to shut you down,” Brooks said. “We’re going to make you take tough shots, and I thought we did that today. We made them take tough shots.”AMOORE SETS 3-POINT MARKAmoore’s five 3-pointers give her 99 on the season. That marks a new single-season school record, breaking the previous record of 96 set by Aisha Sheppard. “I just have a level of confidence right now,” Amoore said. “I give a lot of credit to Coach Brooks because we shoot often, and my teammates help get me open. I seriously feel sorry for Liz because she gets hounded, but it really helps get me open, too.”UP NEXTVirginia Tech: The Hokies will take on South Dakota State, which beat Southern Cal in overtime, on Sunday.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839369,Princeton making another memorable March Madness run,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — When Mitch Henderson took over as coach at Princeton he wanted to give his players a lasting memory like his own — the one from 1996 when as a player he was part of the Tigers that shocked defending-champion UCLA in an iconic March Madness upset.He delivered on a new lasting memory for Princeton with the 15th-seeded Tigers' first-round win over powerhouse Arizona.Now there's a new hurdle to climb.“That game, for those that played in it, it gets brought up to all of us regularly,” Henderson said Friday about the win over UCLA. “This will happen to these guys over time, too. It will be even better if you make the Sweet 16. We want to keep dreaming big here with the group.”After winning a tournament game for the first time in 25 years, Princeton (22-8) can earn its first berth in the Sweet 16 since 1967 when only 23 teams were in the tournament by beating seventh-seeded Missouri (25-9) on Saturday.Princeton followed its last two tournament wins in 1996 and '98 with losses in the second round.“The Sweet 16 sounds pretty good to me,” star forward Tosan Evbuomwan said. “Obviously that’s what we’re working toward. That’s the next step. There’s a game in the way of that. So that’s where we’re putting all our chips in on.”Henderson called the win over Arizona “a million times better” than the ones he enjoyed in the tournament as a player against UCLA in 1996 and UNLV in 1998.He also appreciates that it will give Princeton new memories to celebrate. A photo of him leaping in victory after the UCLA win is still is displayed in Princeton's gym, and Henderson hopes the image earns new company.“That photo is all over Jadwin (Gymnasium),” Henderson said. “I’m glad we can take it down now and put some new photos up. As a player, you’re the beneficiary of so much. You don’t realize it. You think the world’s right in front of you, and you got it all figured out. You get into coaching and you realize how hard those moments are to replicate.”The hours following the 59-55 win over Arizona has been a bit of a whirlwind for the Princeton players, with a team dinner Thursday night, countless congratulatory messages and then the preparation for the game against Missouri.“It’s crazy how many people are watching this game — 15,000 here yesterday, national TV. There's not a bigger stage than this,” forward Zach Martini said. “Just to see how many people pay attention, how many people care that we won a basketball game, it’s like, ‘Wow!’”The stage this week for Princeton has been almost like a Hollywood script.Princeton was matched up with a West Coast powerhouse in the first NCAA Tournament since the death of legendary coach Pete Carril in the city when he finished his coaching career as an NBA assistant after retiring from the Tigers.“I think this group, Coach would be very proud of them,” Henderson said. “He’d love the way we play together.”While the style of play at Princeton has modernized since Carril’s era when the Tigers would bleed most of the shot clock on nearly every possession until exploiting the defense with a backdoor cut, there are still similarities.Princeton’s offense still revolves around a passing big man, with Evbuomwan averaging nearly five assists a game.“Obviously Coach Carril inspired and Princeton inspired,” Evbuomwan said about the offense. “We play probably a little bit faster. We try to push the ball when we can. I think some of the same kind of themes still exist in terms of just playing, limiting play calls, guys having the freedom to play off one another. Obviously the selfless style of basketball that we play on offense. Definitely some big themes remain, but it definitely has evolved.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839370,New Mexico passes bill to safeguard abortion providers,"SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) — New Mexico legislators raced against the clock Friday to advance hard-fought proposals aimed at safeguarding abortion access, delivering tax relief and reducing gun violence in the final hours of a 60-day legislative session.Republicans in the legislative minority raised a series of objections during a House floor debate to a bill that aims to protect abortion providers and patients from out-of-state interference, prosecution or extradition attempts.In a victory for abortion rights advocates in New Mexico and states where the procedure is banned, the House secured final passage of that bill, in a 38-30 vote with Republicans and some Democrats in opposition. Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham is expected to sign it. The governor already signed a law to block local abortion-ban ordinances.Lujan Grisham on Friday said it was increasingly important for New Mexico to broaden its protections for access to abortion, along with gender-affirming health care, amid litigation backed by Republican-led states that threatens the nationwide availability of a leading abortion medication.“We’re broadening those protections to everyone who should be constitutionally protected to make their own decisions ... in light of, right now, Republican attorneys general and others trying to restrict access to medication abortion,” Lujan Grisham said. “New Mexico stood up for science, for women.”Legislators have until noon on Saturday to send other bills to the governor for consideration.Votes were pending Friday on gun control measures including a prohibition on firearms at polling places during an election.Republican and Democratic legislators found common ground in a bill that would allow state prosecution and apply felony penalties to straw purchases of firearms, in which a weapon is bought legally in order to sell it to someone who can’t lawfully possess a gun.A 28-10 vote of the Senate sent the bill to the governor's desk. Sponsors include Republican House minority leaders T. Ryan Lane of Aztec and former police captain and Republican state Rep. Bill Rehm of Albuquerque.It was unclear whether other gun bills would come to a final vote, including a proposed ban on assault rifles, a 14-day waiting period on most gun purchases and a proposal to raise the minimum purchase age to 21 for some firearms. Lujan Grisham signed a bill last week that makes it a crime to store firearms in places that children could access.At a news conference Friday, Lujan Grisham acknowledged a strong culture of gun ownership in New Mexico, including women, and said the state has steadily adopted gun safety measures with that in mind since she took office in 2019.“If you take that context and you look at universal background checks, red-flag laws, the relinquishment of a firearm in certain domestic violence cases — and the safe-storage and the straw-sales purchase bill — we’re doing a lot more on guns in a short amount of time than most states certainly around us,"" she said.In the closing days of the legislature, Republicans rallied around a bill to overhaul medical malpractice regulations. The initiative aims to lower insurance rates for independent clinics and attract more medical professionals to state, especially in remote, rural areas. The Democratic governor helped negotiate provisions of the bill and is expected to sign it into law.The Democrat-led Legislature passed bills in the final days of the session that would boost pay for statewide elected officials, including the attorney general and secretary of state.Among criminal justice initiatives, the governor signed legislation establishing penalties for organized retail crime and end the possibility of life prison sentences without the possibility of parole for crimes committed as children.A bill that would eliminate court fees that can have a disproportionate effect on the poor won Senate endorsement Friday on a 35-1 vote, advancing to the governor's desk. Fines imposed as a punishment for an offense would not be waived.Lujan Grisham has signed a bill that ends the widespread practice of suspending driver’s licenses because of overdue court debts or missed court hearings. Sponsors of the bill, including Republican state Sen. Crystal Diamond of Elephant Butte and Democratic Senate Majority Leader Peter Wirth, say that debt-based license suspensions are counterproductive.Another bill on the governor’s desk would use opioid settlement funds to provide treatment at county jails to inmates for drug addiction and alcohol dependency, by administering drugs including methadone and buprenorphine that can stop drug cravings without causing a euphoric high.The governor on Thursday signed a bill that will establish an office of renewable energy to oversee the expansion of wind and solar-energy production leases on state trust land.The State Land Office would oversee the new division. The agency that once focused on oil and natural gas development has expanded renewable energy development in recent years to oversee 27 leases for wind energy production.",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839371,PSU's Funk lands on list of great March Madness shooters,"DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — Penn State star Jalen Pickett was already familiar with Andrew Funk and his long-distance shooting acumen, having faced the Nittany Lions newcomer in a Siena-Bucknell game with their previous teams.When they were paired together in a preseason workout last fall, well, the impression was really made.“We were shooting partners in one of the drills, and we won the shooting contest. I didn’t make many shots, but Andrew made most of them,” Pickett said with a smile. “I knew he could shoot it.”The rest of the country found out Thursday night, when Funk went 8 for 10 from 3-point range for a season-high 27 points to highlight No. 10 seed Penn State's one-sided victory over Texas A&M.“Definitely, seeing that first one go in made me feel good,” said Funk, a fifth-year graduate transfer who is shooting a career-best 42% from deep.That initial make just 2:12 into the game helped alleviate the natural anxiety of his first NCAA Tournament appearance. The other reason it was so satisfying, Funk said, was the validation of the confidence coach Micah Shrewsberry has shown in him to make the outside shot.Even if some of his attempts over the course of this one and only season in Penn State's blue and white have come with a high degree of difficulty.“I don’t really talk a lot about shot selection,"" Shrewsberry said Friday, as Penn State prepared to play No. 2 seed Texas in the second round in the Midwest Region. ""Every once in a while I might say something, but you need guys to feel confident. You need guys to play free. You don’t want them looking over their shoulders worried about whether Coach likes this shot or not.”Funk became fully aware of that faith in his shooting touch after a preseason film session with assistant coach Adam Fisher. Funk asked Fisher, “Is he OK with me shooting this?” And Fisher replied, “Yes, shoot it more.”Bucknell made the NCAA Tournament in 2017 and 2018, right before Funk arrived. With the Bison, he was more of a combo guard with varying roles and responsibilities, becoming a starter as a sophomore and averaging 17.6 points per game as a second team All-Patriot League pick in 2021-22.With Penn State, the 6-foot-5 Funk has been able to specialize — and thrive. The presence and passing ability of Pickett, the second team All-American who is in his second season with the program, has been a big boost.Funk went 7 for 12 from 3-point range on Jan. 11 in a decisive victory over Indiana. He helped the Nittany Lions sweep their three games against Illinois, including a 6-for-9 performance from deep in their Big Ten Tournament opener.“I don’t need to worry if I’m going to get pulled out of the game for taking bad shots,” Funk said. “Coach having the confidence in me that I’m going to keep taking them and making them, that means the world to me.”As all those swishes stacked up against the Aggies, casual fans across the country flipping back and forth between the late-night games suddenly began googling for background info on Penn State’s latest long-range ace. Even though it was just a first-round game, Funk carved out some space for himself on the list of recent memorable March shooting clinics with the likes of Villanova’s Donte DiVincenzo, Oklahoma's Buddy Hield and Purdue’s Carsen Edwards.Or Jimmer Fredette in BYU's NCAA Tournament runs in 2010 and 2011. Fredette was the player Funk named on Friday when asked whom he remembered tearing it up from the 3-point line while watching the action on TV as a kid in the Philadelphia area in a family with five boys.Funk matched Shep Garner (2015) for the second-most made 3-pointers in Penn State history, one short of Pete Lisicky’s program record from 1995. Only 12 players in NCAA Tournament history have made more in a game than Funk, whose total was the highest in four years since Edwards made 10 in a regional final loss to eventual national champion Virginia.“It surprises me when he misses, because I know all the work that he’s put in,” Shrewsberry said. “He’s just playing free.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839372,Donovan says Ball faces 'long rehab' with another surgery,"CHICAGO (AP) — Bulls coach Billy Donovan wasn't sure when or even if Lonzo Ball will play again for Chicago, with the point guard set to have yet another surgery on his troublesome left knee.Donovan said Ball will likely undergo a cartilage transplant early next week, though he wasn't sure which day, and is in for “a long rehab.”“For me to say, 'I have no hope that he's ever gonna play here again' or ‘yeah, he’s definitely going to be back,' I just don't know,"" Donovan said Friday.One thing that gives Donovan optimism is Ball's work ethic and attitude.“Even though he comes in, he's around the team for a period of time, there is a lot of time that he's away from everybody,"" Donovan said. ""Just having to come to grips of not playing is really, really hard, I think, probably for him to absorb. But he handles himself incredibly well. He's so consistent all the time with his spirit and disposition and what he's tried to do every step of the way to get back.”The surgery will be the third on the knee in 14 months for Ball, who also had it scoped in 2018 when he was with the Los Angeles Lakers. The Bulls ruled him out for the season in February.“The fact that the game's been taken away from him and he can't play, you just feel terrible for him because he loves the game, he loves playing,” Donovan said. “You see everything he has done since this happened to try to get himself back on the court, and you always want to see a guy get rewarded by putting in the work that he's put in to get back.”Ball hasn't played since a loss to Golden State on Jan. 14, 2022. He had surgery for a torn meniscus a few weeks later that was expected to keep him out six to eight weeks, but he experienced setbacks when he tried to ramp up basketball activities.The Bulls had him rest for 10 days at one point, hoping it would resolve the issue and allow him to return. But he felt pain again when he started preparing to play.Ball was still unable to run at full speed, or even walk up stairs, without experiencing discomfort when he had another operation in late September. He said at the time he expected to play this season.Ball has been able to do some on-court work. He posted a video on Instagram in January of him dunking. But it became more and more clear that probably wouldn’t happen.Ball averaged 13 points and 5.1 assists while shooting 42.3% on 3-pointers over 35 games last season — his first in Chicago. He helped set up stars Zach LaVine and DeMar DeRozan and gave the Bulls an elite perimeter defender.The Bulls were 12th in the Eastern Conference at 31-37 entering Friday's game against Minnesota. They had won two of three.___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839373,Jayhawks' March Madness star gets basketball genes from mom,"DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — Gradey Dick set the Kansas freshman record for 3-point field goals, recorded the first double-double of his career in the Jayhawks' opener in the NCAA Tournament and is on track to be an NBA lottery pick in June.His mom, a player of her own accomplishment, is proud of him, of course.But Carmen Dick concedes nothing to him as a basketball player. That's not how their uber-competitive family operates.Her son played the starring role in a first-round win over Howard on Thursday and next he'll lead the top-seeded and defending champion Jayhawks (28-7) into a Saturday game against No. 8 Arkansas (21-13).No. 2 UCLA (30-5) plays No. 7 Northwestern (22-11) in Sacramento, California, in the other West game.Kansas' opening tournament games are being played at Wells Fargo Arena, which is right across the street from Veterans Auditorium. That's where Carmen Dick — then Carmen Jaspers — built her legacy as one of Iowa's greatest high school players before she became a 1,000-point scorer at Iowa State.Since the Jayhawks arrived in Des Moines, locals have regaled Gradey Dick with memories of his mom dominating the competition in the old six-girl game Iowa high schools played until 30 years ago.“Yeah, he knows what I did. He's well aware,” Carmen Dick said Friday. “We have competitions, and he's got me on a few and I've got him on a few.”Gradey is the better 3-point shooter, but Carmen notes there were no 3s in her day. For her part, she played in three straight state tournaments for Ackley-Geneva High at Veterans Auditorium (1983-85), averaged 40 points per game as a senior and still ranks 10th all-time with her 77.6% shooting in 1984.As a collegian, she was Iowa State's female athlete of the year in 1989 and still holds the school single-game free-throw record by going 15 for 15 against Kansas in 1988.“I haven’t gotten near to that, so she holds that over me,” said Gradey, who had 19 points, 11 rebounds, five assists and three steals in his first NCAA Tournament game.Gradey said he admires his mom's accomplishments. Because she played under the basket in high school and college, she's even taught him a few inside moves.“You never know when he might need to use those,” she said.Carmen Dick is a personal trainer in Wichita, Kansas, where she and her husband, Bart, and raised Gradey as the youngest of four children. She said age has taken some of the luster off her game, but she doesn't back down from a challenge on the court.“We all played a lot of games in the backyard,” she said, laughing, “and there was no mercy. No mercy.”Gradey said she still has game.“Nowadays it's more H-O-R-S-E,"" he said. ""Her mid-range game, she does not miss. Never.”Kansas acting coach Norm Roberts said, “Gradey, he knows his mom is the best player in the house. We know all that. When you are coaching Gradey and talking to him about different things, his mom knows what’s going on.”ANOTHER NO. 1 FOR ARKANSASThis marks the third straight year Arkansas will play a No. 1 seed. The Razorbacks knocked off Gonzaga 74-68 in San Francisco in the Sweet 16 last year and lost to Baylor 81-72 in the Elite Eight in Indianapolis in 2021.“We talked about the mentality that you need to have going into this particular game,” coach Eric Musselman said. “Not good luck to play three number ones in three years. I don’t know if that’s ever happened before. But if it has happened before, it certainly hasn’t happened with many programs.”The Razorbacks were seeded Nos. 4 and 3 the past two years and are a No. 8 this time. Arkansas is a 3 1/2-point underdog to Kansas, according to FanDuel Sportsbook, after being a 2-point favorite against Illinois.“I don’t think many people believed in us yesterday going into that game,” Musselman said. ""Yeah, I think we need to play with a free mind. We need to not feel pressure. Our guys are smart. They’re on Twitter. They’re on Instagram. They know. They know what we’re playing against.""EXPERIENCE GAPUCLA’s NCAA Tournament accolades are legendary with 11 national titles and 19 appearances in the Final Four.The Bruins’ second-round opponent has just a bit less history on this stage. Northwestern is making only its second appearance. The Wildcats have never made it as far as the Sweet 16, losing in the second round in 2017 in their only other tournament trip.“As a program, it would be huge,” forward Robbie Beran said. “I knew we had something special. Really just trying to make history. ... It will be a huge step for the program. But we’re just trying to focus on the game. We’re not really trying to look at how it affects Northwestern basketball legacy.”UCLA coach Mick Cronin is focused less on that discrepancy in experience and more on an opponent with a tough defense that has endured a difficult Big Ten schedule.“Experience always helps,” he said. “If you can have talent and experience, you got a better chance. But I’ll take talent.” ___AP Sports Writer Josh Dubow contributed from Sacramento, California.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839374,UCLA's Osborne happy to get another chance to play at home,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Three weeks ago, Charisma Osbourne thought she played her final game at Pauley Pavilion. UCLA's run to the Pac-12 tournament championship game though has given Osbourne at least one more chance to play at home.Osborne and the fourth-seeded Bruins open NCAA Tournament play on Saturday against No. 13 seed Sacramento State.“I’m super excited to be back here. Just to be able to have our fans and my family come out and see me play here again is going to be really fun,” Osborne said.The UCLA (25-9)-Sacramento State (25-7) winner will face either fifth-seeded Oklahoma (25-6) or No. 12 Portland (23-8) on Monday. The winner of Monday's game will advance in the Greenville 1 region.The 5-foot-9 guard was the Bruins leading scorer for the second straight season, averaging 15.5 points per game. With UCLA bringing in the nation's top-ranked signing class, including heralded point guard Kiki Rice, Osborne saw her role change from running the point to moving back to shooting guard, which she did her freshman season.The other big change is that Osborne evolved into a leader on what was mostly a young squad.“I think it’s been so fun to have them because they have challenged me as a leader to just be a better teammate, just be more helpful to them because this is all just so new to them,” said Osborne, who was seventh in the Pac-12 in scoring.Coach Cori Close said the biggest improvement she has seen in Osborne's game is that she has become an efficient scorer. Osborne had a stretch during the middle of the season where she was relying too much on outside shooting before she started driving more to the paint and drawing fouls.“What I seen her evolve through this year is get back to being an efficient player that knows how to read defenses and take the shots she is given by the defense,” Close said.QUICK TURNAROUNDSacramento State is making its first trip just two years after going 3-22. The Hornets won the Big Sky Tournament after finishing in a three-way tie for the regular season crown.“This is what we came here for. We thought Sac State had an opportunity to be something special,” said coach Mark Campbell, who is in his second season. “It’s a beautiful campus. 30,000 students; football had been winning; baseball had been winning, and it was a program that it needed to be fixed. We thought there was a lot of potential and it’s happened quickly. Probably quicker than we all thought.”The Hornets were buoyed by five transfers this season, including Kahlaijah Dean, who was named the Big Sky’s MVP. Dean, who transferred from Oakland University in Michigan, averaged 21.3 points, 5.4 rebounds and 5.2 assists.ROAD RAGE?Oklahoma coach Jennie Baranczyk isn't frustrated that the Sooners had to go on the road for the first two rounds, but she was disappointed only one Big 12 team was selected to host.“I think that’s unfortunate because I think we do have a lot of parity and we have some great teams in our conference,” she said. “If you spend your energy on the wrong things, you’re not spending your energy on the right things. So for us, we weren’t in any of the reveals. It wasn’t something that it was like, okay, this is what’s motivating us. We need to be better.”The Sooners, who were the Big 12's regular season co-champion, come in with the nation's second-ranked offense, averaging 84.5 points per game. They are 21-0 when scoring at least 80 points per game.Oklahoma is one of two schools in the country to have two active 2,000-point career scorers in Madi Williams and Taylor Robertson. Williams leads the team in scoring at 15.5 points per game.WELCOME BACKPortland is playing in the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 1997. The Pilots qualified three years ago but the tournament was not played due to the coronavirus pandemic.“Our five seniors won the West Coast Conference in 2020 but didn’t have a chance to play in the tournament. I’m so excited and happy for them,"" coach Michael Meek said. ""I know that it was really important for them to have this opportunity. I think it’s really a relief for our staff just to allow them to have this experience.”Portland's roster features eight players from Australia and two from New Zealand.Alex Fowler, who leads the Pilots in scoring at 17.8 points per game, said the key against Oklahoma will be trying to take away their perimeter shooting.“We’re a team that likes to get other teams out of their style of play and pressure and get all over them,” she said. “So hopefully, if we’re able to do that and stop those transition buckets and their three-point game.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839375,Reese leads LSU past Hawaii in March Madness opening round,"BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) — A dynamic and prolific All-America power forward like Angel Reese can cover up for some flaws.Take ice-cold perimeter shooting, for example.LSU missed 13 of 14 3-pointers, but Reese had 34 points and 15 rebounds, and the third-seeded Tigers defeated No. 14 seed Hawaii 73-50 on Friday night in the first round of the women’s NCAA Tournament.“I’ve always been blessed to have good post play,” said LSU coach Kim Mulkey, who won a national title as Baylor's coach in 2012 with Brittney Griner at center. “I’ve never had to coach a team that jacks 3s up and shoots 30-plus a game. How many of these teams ever win national championships? Men or women? They may in the pros ... but it’s a different game at the pro level.”Flau'Jae Johnson scored 10 for LSU (29-2), which raced to a double-digit lead in the first quarter and maintained a comfortable lead most of the way.The Tigers advanced to a second-round match-up on Sunday with sixth seeded Michigan (23-9), a 71-59 winner over 11 seed UNLV earlier Friday.Reese, an All-America forward, was a force in the paint while registering her 29th double-double this season, and also was effective defending on the perimeter. She was 13 of 20 shooting, hit 8 of 12 free throws and also had three blocks and three steals.“Reese is going to get what she gets,” Hawaii coach Laura Beeman said. “She’s going to go No. 1, No. 2 in the WNBA (draft); we don’t have a pro on our team right now.”Reese looked unfazed when multiple defenders on her. Help defenders were often late on her explosive cuts and drives to the hoop anyway. She was also shifty and creative enough to score when the lane got crowded, exemplified by her spinning drive that set up a scoop shot off the glass as she was fouled.“I’ve seen double teams all year. I’ve seen post players become aggressive with me down low,” Reese said. “A lot of teams become physical with me, and I just can’t let that get to me mentally.”LSU outscored Hawaii 44-16 in the paint and outrebounded the Rainbow Wahine 40-33.Meanwhile, LSU's defense forced Hawaii to play at a slower pace than planned on the offensive end.“We couldn’t get downhill and drive and kick, and they closed so quickly that when we thought when they had shots, they were right there in our face,"" Beeman said. “It wasn’t our game plan to run the clock down. It was our game plan to run down and get great shots. They make that very, very difficult.”Kallin Spiller and Daejah Phillips each scored 13 for Hawaii (18-15) which was held 10 points below its average scoring total for the season. Lily Wahinekapu scored 11 for the Rainbow Wahine.“Guarding Angel Reese was difficult,” said Spiller, a center. ""As a post (player) focused on rebounding, I know how hard it is to collect those double doubles at the level she does.“It’s clear they are going to make a run,” Spiller added. “I’m rooting for them — for the ones that knocked us out. I’m hoping they go far.”BIG PICTUREHawaii: Were held to 31% (16 of 52) shooting overall and made just seven of 32 attempts from 3-point range. ... The loss was just the third in the past 13 games for Hawaii, winners of the Big West tournament.LSU: Reese grabbed six of her rebounds on the offensive end, helping LSU score 17 second-chance points. ... The Tigers won comfortably despite missing 13 of 14 3-point shots. ... LSU has now gone 55-8 since three-time national champion coach Kim Mulkey left Baylor to coach the Tigers before the 2021-22 season. ... Reese briefly appeared to have pain in her lower leg during the game, “I caught a cramp,” she said afterward. “That was it. It wasn’t my ankle.” ... Mulkey won her 20th straight first-round NCAA game to improve to 20-1 in such contests.NO WORRIESThis wasn't the first time LSU had an off night from deep and still won comfortably. The Tigers went 0-for 14 from 3 in a 74-59 victory over Mississippi State on Feb. 26.“We are not going to live and die by the three ball. That doesn’t mean we don’t have kids that can shoot it,” Mulkey said, noting that her team had not played for nearly two weeks since losing to Tennessee in the SEC Tournament. “We were a little rusty and missed some open looks. ... I would say, ‘Leave us open. Leave us open if you don’t think we can make it.’ We are not afraid to shoot it.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839376,Alabama's Miller trying to rebound from scoreless game,"BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) — Brandon Miller was in a playful mood and feeling good physically, too.A day after being limited by a groin injury and held without a point, Miller insisted Friday he's just fine for top overall seed Alabama's second-round NCAA Tournament game against No. 8 seed Maryland on Saturday night.“I'm 100 percent right now. You want to play 1 v. 1?” the 6-foot-9 Miller joked with a much shorter reporter.Miller played only 19 minutes in a first-round mismatch against Texas A&M-Corpus Christi, sitting out most of the second half after telling coach Nate Oats his injured groin was bothering him. The All-American and potential NBA lottery pick came into that goose-egg game averaging 20 points.“I think he just took a nice night off. Well deserved,” cracked Terrapins coach Kevin Willard, who compared Miller to NBA star Paul George.Oats was more cautiously optimistic about Miller's health, but said he's still pretty good even when playing through injury. He said Miller was limited in practice a day before the game for Alabama (30-5).“It obviously wasn’t one of his better games to open, but I think knowing Brandon and how tough he is, physically, mentally, I think he’ll be ready to go (Saturday),” Oats said.Teammates praised Miller for how he handled the game. It was only the second time he hadn't reached double digits, with fellow No. 1 seed Houston holding him to eight points on Dec. 10.“He handled it like a true professional,” point guard Jahvon Quinerly said. “I told him, look, we’re going to need what you’ve been bringing us all year (Saturday) night. I’m 100 percent confident he’s going to bring what he’s been bringing us all year.”Alabama flashed its depth with backups like Nick Pringle and Nimari Burnett stepping up when Miller was having an off game. That led Willard to compare this Tide team to Rick Pitino's uber-talented Kentucky teams in the mid-1990s.“I think this is the most talented roster I’ve seen in college basketball since the '93-94 Kentucky team,” said Willard, the only Maryland coach to reach 20 wins in his first season. “This team reminds me of that team with the length, athleticism, how unselfish they play, very similar point guards.”As for Oats, he had suspicions that Willard was “trying to talk our team up. I don't know if we're quite that good, but we'll see.”Maryland had a much tougher first-round challenge, moving on with a 67-65 win over West Virginia. The Terrapins, who are seeking their 15th Sweet 16 trip but first since 2016, are giving up 63.2 points per game, their lowest yield since 1981-82.Alabama and Maryland’s last meeting was in the second round of the 2021 NCAA Tournament, before Willard or Miller were on the scene. The Tide made 16 3-pointers in a 96-77 win. Quinerly is one of the few holdovers from that game on either team. Maryland has Donta Scott and Hakim Hart still around.“It's kind of like a Round of 32 rematch from two years ago,” Quinerly said. “That's exciting.”ONE-SHOT WONDERS?Furman (28-7) doesn’t want to be a one-shot wonder.The 13th-seeded Paladins became March Madness darlings, taking down No. 4 seed Virginia in the opening round on JP Pegues’ 3-pointer that propelled the Southern Conference champions to Saturday’s second-round matchup against No. 5 seed San Diego State.“The Furman game? That was crazy,” San Diego State guard Lamont Butler said. “But this is March, so anything can happen.”The Aztecs (28-6), who have won 11 of their past 12, advanced with a first-round win over Charleston. There's no temptation to look past the Paladins, who were impressive in their rally against Virginia.“Furman is playing good basketball. I don’t care what seed they are,” San Diego State coach Brian Dutcher said. “They’re playing good basketball or they wouldn’t have won (against Virginia), so now we have to find a way to disrupt them and play our best brand of basketball.”SILENCE THE CROWDMissouri's players know they probably won’t be the fan favorites when they take on tournament darling Princeton in the second round in Sacramento, California.The neutral fans at the Golden 1 Center pulled loudly for 15th-seeded Princeton during its first-round stunner against Arizona and will likely get similar support in a second-round matchup against another power conference school.“Everybody loves a good underdog story,” Missouri guard Nick Honor said. “But they’re a great team. So it will just be a good game. You don’t really focus on seedings and all that. We realize every team is a great basketball team in this tournament. So we’re just going to focus on what we need to do. If the crowd goes for them, that’s cool as well. We’re kind of just used to it. It’s all good.”Both sets of Tigers have gone a long time without reaching the Sweet 16 with Missouri (25-9) last getting there in 2009 and Princeton in 1967 when only 23 teams made the tournament.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/18,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839379,Russia will extend Ukraine grain deal for 60 days — not 120,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) — On the eve of the expiration of a deal enabling Ukraine to export grain, the United Nations’ humanitarian chief on Friday called its extension crucial to ensuring global food supplies and keeping prices from spiraling as they did after Russia’s invasion of its smaller neighbor.Russia’s U.N. ambassador reiterated that Moscow is ready to extend the deal — but only for 60 days, just half the 120 days in the agreement.Russian envoy Vassily Nebenzia’s briefing to the U.N. Security Council, reiterating what a Russian delegation told senior U.N. officials at a meeting in Geneva on Monday, reinforced the Kremlin’s insistence on reducing the duration of the deal to hold out for changes on how the package is working.The U.N. and Turkey brokered the deal between the warring countries last July that allows Ukraine — one of the world’s key breadbaskets — to ship food and fertilizer from three of its Black Sea ports. A separate memorandum of understanding between the United Nations and Russia is aimed at overcoming obstacles to Moscow’s shipments of fertilizer to global markets.The original 120-day agreement was renewed last November and expires Saturday. It would be automatically extended for another 120 days unless one of the parties objects — and Nebenzia said Russia has formally objected.U.N. Undersecretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Martin Griffiths opened the Security Council meeting saying the Black Sea grain initiative has seen global food prices continue to fall.Under the initiative, he said, close to 25 million metric tons of foodstuff have been exported since last August, and the U.N. World Food Program has been able to transport more than half a million metric tons of wheat to support humanitarian operations in Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia and Yemen. Griffiths also said it’s vital for the U.N.-Russia memorandum to be fully implemented.There has been “meaningful progress, but impediments remain, notably with regard to payment systems,” he said, stressing that U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and trade chief Rebeca Grynspan “are sparing no effort to facilitate its full implementation.”But Russia’s Nebenzia said “the memorandum is simply not working,” and the U.N. has to recognize it has “no leverage to exempt Russian agricultural export operations from Western sanctions” and its efforts have not produced results.He also claimed that the Ukraine grain export deal had been transformed from a humanitarian initiative to help developing countries facing escalating food prices to a commercial operation benefiting the world’s four leading Western agro-business corporations.As a result, Nebenzia said Russia has officially informed the Turkish and Ukrainian sides through a note that it does not object to extending the Black Sea grain initiative, but just for 60 days, until May 18.“If Brussels, Washington and London are genuinely interested to continue the export of food from Ukraine through the maritime humanitarian corridor, then they have two months to exempt from their sanctions the entire chain of operations which accompany the Russian agricultural sector,” the Russian envoy said.“Otherwise, we fail to understand how the package concept of the secretary-general of the United Nations will work through these simple agreements,” he said.U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield countered that the world knows that Russia’s food exports are at least as high as their pre-war levels, and “when we hear the Russian government say they are being held back from exporting grain, from exporting fertilizer, the numbers show it’s just not true.”When it comes to sanctions, “we have gone to extraordinary lengths to communicate the clear carveouts for food and fertilizer to governments and to the private sector,” she said. “Simply put, sanctions are not the issue.”Thomas-Greenfield also criticized Russia for delaying shipping from Ukrainian ports, which increases transportation costs.",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839380,New Mexico opts for veto power on spent nuclear fuel debate,"ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) — New Mexico's governor on Friday signed legislation aimed at keeping spent nuclear fuel produced by commercial U.S. nuclear power plants from being shipped to the state, just hours after the measure cleared its final legislative hurdle.Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham wasted no time adding her signature after the New Mexico House voted 35-28 in favor of the bill following a lengthy debate. Five Democrats joined Republicans in opposition, arguing that the measure would challenge longstanding federal authority over nuclear safety matters and lead to new court challenges.The bill from Democratic state Sen. Jeff Steinborn, of Las Cruces, will impact a proposed multibillion-dollar facility in southeastern New Mexico that would have the capacity to temporarily store up to 8,680 metric tons of used uranium fuel. Future expansion could make room for as many as 10,000 canisters of spent fuel over six decades.The Nuclear Regulatory Commission may announce a decision soon on whether to grant a license for the project spearheaded by Holtec International, which has spent an estimated $80 million over the past eight years on the approval process.Lujan Grisham and members of New Mexico’s congressional delegation have voiced strong opposition to building the facility along the state’s border with Texas. Both states sued the federal government over the issue, and top elected officials in Texas were unsuccessful in their efforts to stop a similar facility in neighboring Andrews County from being licensed.If a license is granted for the complex in New Mexico, it would still need permits from the state Environment Department. That's where critics say the state could lean on the legislation and halt the project.Rep. Gail Chasey, an Albuquerque Democrat, argued that there has been no incentive for states with nuclear power plants to find permanent solutions for dealing with spent fuel. As long as New Mexico is seen as an option, those states won't be concerned with the long-term effects, she said.“The trouble is this is a forever decision. We don't get to decide, oh, let's not do this anymore and take it away,"" Chasey said. ""So think about the fact that if it were such a profitable and good thing, then the states that produced it would have it near their facilities.”According to the U.S. Department of Energy, nuclear reactors across the country produce more than 2,000 metric tons of radioactive waste a year, with most of it remaining on-site because there’s nowhere else to put it.Since the federal government has failed to build a permanent repository, it reimburses utilities to house the fuel. That cost is expected to stretch into the tens of billions of dollars over the next decade, according to a review by independent government auditors.The fuel is sitting at temporary storage sites in nearly three dozen states, either enclosed in steel-lined concrete pools of water or in steel and concrete containers known as casks.U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm has talked about revisiting recommendations made a decade ago by a blue-ribbon commission on America’s nuclear future. In November, her agency issued a request seeking input on a consent-based siting process to identify locations to store commercial spent nuclear fuel.Despite opposition from environmentalists, the Biden administration has pointed to nuclear power as essential to achieving its goals to create a carbon-free electricity sector by 2035.Some lawmakers from southeastern New Mexico said local elected officials and residents would welcome the Holtec project and that visits to some of the current storage sites near power plants have shown the casks are safe.They also touted the safety of transporting the material by rail to New Mexico, saying armed guards would be aboard the trains and that testing has shown the casks would not release radiation in the event of a derailment.Republican Rep. Cathrynn Brown, whose district includes the proposed Holtec site, said the region already is home to the federal government's only underground repository for Cold War-era waste generated during nuclear research and bomb-making. It also hosts a uranium enrichment plant.The legislation sends a message to companies to “invest all you want and then we’re going to pull the rug out from under you,” Brown said. ""And I don’t think that’s fair.”Still, other lawmakers have voiced concerns about the project since it would be located within the Permian Basin, one of the most productive oil fields in the world. New Mexico gets a significant portion of its revenue from drilling.",2023/3/18,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839395,Native American groups blast governor for agency appointment,"SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) — A coalition of advocates dedicated to stemming the tide of violence and missing persons cases in Indian Country is demanding more transparency from New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, saying there should be greater accountability in the system for vetting state-appointed positions that serve Indigenous communities.About 30 protesters gathered Friday in the state Capitol rotunda to voice concerns about the Democratic governor’s contested pick to head the state’s Indian Affairs Department. They want the governor to withdraw her appointment of James Mountain, citing charges he once faced.They were joined by legislators, including Democratic Sen. Shannon Pinto of the Navajo community of Tohatchi. The Navajo Nation president also has said he cannot support the appointment.“For so many survivors, when we see James Mountain, we see our abusers,” said Angel Charley, executive director of the Coalition to Stop Violence Against Native Women.She said Mountain’s appointment has overshadowed a stalled proposal in the Legislature to make crime victims’ reparations funds available to the families of missing and slain Native Americans.“He knows how much division there is because of his nomination,"" she said. ""Step down.”Lujan Grisham’s appointment has sent shockwaves through tribal communities. While the governor so far has continued to defend Mountain, she has yet to submit his nomination to the Senate for confirmation despite the legislative session ending at noon Saturday.“I appreciate the passion. But I think that some of the efforts here are a bit unfair and are very misguided,” Lujan Grisham said Friday at a news conference.Many in the Democratic-led Legislature have remained mum about the governor’s choice not to push for a hearing, which would offer a public forum for Mountain to be vetted.A former San Ildefonso Pueblo governor, Mountain was once was indicted on charges that included criminal sexual penetration, kidnapping and aggravated battery of a household member. The charges were dropped in 2010, with prosecutors saying they did not have enough evidence to go to trial.The governor has said those who disagree should respect that charges against Mountain were dismissed.“I do think that some of that passion about a zero-tolerance standard is pretty interesting in this regard: dismissed case, old,"" Lujan Grisham said. ""He’s defending himself effectively. I feel terrible for his whole family.”The coalition has said New Mexico continues to have the highest rate of missing and slain Native American relatives and that “we are at a critical turning point as an Indigenous people.”“The pervasive culture of violence has normalized behaviors that were once unthinkable in our communities,” the coalition said in a statement. “We are reduced to speaking in hushed whispers about violence that we have not only personally experienced, but that we experience daily in our homes and communities.”“When we have the courage to speak out, we are often met with blame and stigma, as though we have caused these problems ourselves,” the statement continued.Aside from recalling Mountain's appointment, the coalition is demanding a rigorous vetting process for all state-appointed positions that serve Indigenous communities and that any nominee with a court record or indictment related to rape or domestic violence be disqualified.They also are seeking the creation of a community advisory committee to help vet state-appointed tribal leadership.“We cannot rely solely on the All Pueblo Council of Governors, the Navajo Nation leaders, Apache leaders, and/or Indigenous male state leaders for the vetting of candidates, as we have learned over the years that tribal leaders actively participate in the patriarchal culture of protecting perpetrators,” the coalition said.The groups also want a formal apology from Lujan Grisham “for this outrageous nomination” and demanded that an Indigenous woman be appointed as head of the New Mexico Department of Indian Affairs.Mountain has not directly addressed the concerns about his nomination. In a letter directed at state lawmakers, his daughter, Leah Mountain, described him as a devoted father who instilled cultural identity, confidence and aspiration in her after her mother left. She said the allegations against him are false.Mountain still can serve as head of Indian Affairs without confirmation, and the next likely opportunity for the full Senate to vote on confirming him wouldn’t come until January 2024.___Montoya Bryan reported from Albuquerque.",2023/3/18,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839398,"200s for Williamson, Nicholls; NZ declare at 580-4, 2nd test","WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — Kane Williamson and Henry Nicholls made double centuries in a 363-run partnership for the third wicket as New Zealand amassed 580-4 before declaring its first innings Saturday on the second day of the second cricket test against Sri Lanka.Williamson posted his sixth double century and was out for 215 and Nicholls brought up his first and highest test score for New Zealand and was 200 not out when captain Tim Southee signaled the declaration.It was the first time two New Zealand batsmen had scored double centuries in the same innings of a test.The partnership was the ninth-highest for the third wicket in all tests and New Zealand’s highest since Martin Crowe and Andre Jones made 467 against Sri Lanka in the Basin Reserve in 1991.Williamson batted for 6-1/2 hours and Henry for one minute longer.New Zealand resumed Saturday at 155-2 with Williamson 26 not out and Nicholls and 18. Williamson and Nicholls stayed together for most of the rest of the day.“It was great fun. The way Kane batted was brilliant and he just allowed me to do my thing,” Nicholls said. “We had ebbs and flows throughout the day but as I said it was a fun day.“I think we just wanted to bat as long as we can. I think when Kane got 100 he just flew to 130 and we kept feeding off each other. As the day went on we were able to up the tempo a bit and to get those two wickets was great heading into tomorrow.”At stumps and after 17 overs, Sri Lanka was 26-2 with captain Dimuth Karunaratne 16 not out and nightwatchman Prabath Jayarsuriya 4 not out.Oshada Fernando was out for 6, caught by Tom Blundell from the bowling of Matt Henry and Kusal Mendis was 4 when he was brilliantly caught at point by Devon Conway off Doug Bracewell who is playing his first test since 2016.The first day at the Basin Reserve was dark and gloomy. Only 48 overs were possible between the rain-delayed start and finish hastened by bad light. The second day dawned bright and sunny and the pitch at the Basin Reserve, which was soft and slow on the first day, had become firm and ideal for batting.Williamson scored an unbeaten 121 when New Zealand beat Sri Lanka by two wickets from the final ball of the first test and 132 as New Zealand beat England by one run in the second test at the Basin Reserve one month ago.Nicholls had gone 10 tests since he last passed 50: he made only 2 and 20 in the first test against Sri Lanka and 70 at 17 in four innings over two tests against England.Through the day, Williamson and Henry built and built and built until New Zealand was in a secure to declare. Milestones passed steadily and at speed.Williamson reached 50 from 106 balls in 142 minutes and Nicholls’ half century came from 79 balls in 145 minutes as he played a subordinate role early on.At 91 Williamson pased 8,000 runs in tests and his 28th test century came in 231 minutes with 10 fours and two sixes. Nicholls followed Williamson to a century from 173 balls in just under five hours.The pair passed 150 for the third wicket, then 200, then 250 and 300 from only 420 balls. Williamson reached 200 from 285 balls, in 460 minutes and the scoring rate picked up as the day went on.Eventually, it became clear New Zealand was eager to declare and the pace stepped up. Williamson was out for 215, hitting out and caught at long-on. Daryl Mitchell came and went and was out for 17 when New Zealand was 530-4.Nicholls pressed on and reached his 200 from 249 balls and Southee signaled the declaration soon after from the players’ balcony.___More AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839399,Tejano musician Fito Olivares dies in Houston at 75,"HOUSTON (AP) — Tejano musician Fito Olivares, known for songs that were wedding and quinceanera mainstays including the hit “Juana La Cubana,” died Friday. He was 75.The noted saxophonist died in the morning at home in Houston, according to his wife, Griselda Olivares. She said he was diagnosed with cancer last year.Born Rodolfo Olivares in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas on April 19, 1947, Fito Olivares started playing professionally in his teens. In 1980, he and his brothers formed Olivares y su Grupo La Pura Sabrosura and moved to Houston.Other tunes he is known for include “Aguita de Melon,” “El Chicle"" and “El Colesterol.” In addition to playing the saxophone, he also played accordion, wrote songs and occasionally sang, his wife said.Griselda Olivares said the family was seeing a lot of support from fans on social media. “They played the music all over the world,” she said.Among those posting tributes was Ed Gonzalez, the sheriff for Harris County, where Houston is located.“Rest in peace to a legend we all grew up with Fito Olivares,” Gonzalez tweeted. “Thank you for the music.”",2023/3/19,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839400,Analytics expert says portal hurting some major programs,"A University of Illinois professor who runs an analytics website thinks the transfer portal has hurt some power conference schools in the NCAA Tournament.Changes brought on by an increasingly active portal have diminished the cohesiveness within some marquee programs, said Sheldon Jacobson, who operates the site BracketOdds. Lower-seeded teams from mid-major conferences are more likely to have a core group of players who have been together three or four years.Seven No. 15 seeds have won at least one game over the past 11 years, including each of the last three NCAA Tournaments for the first time. The latest one was Princeton's 59-55 victory over Arizona on Thursday.No. 13 Furman topped No. 4 Virginia 68-67 in another big upset on the first day of this year's tourney.“So although it looks like, ”Wow, we have these big upsets,' statistically speaking, it is not that unusual,"" Jacobson said. “There’s not much difference between a five, six or seven and a 10, 11 or 12. Surely, the five, six and seven are going to win more often, but not that much more often statistically speaking.""Jacobson said a day of upsets often leads to a predictable set of results the following day. Much of Friday played out that way, but No. 16 seed Fairleigh Dickinson beat top-seeded Purdue 63-58 at night in one of the biggest surprises in tournament history.Looking ahead to the Final Four, Jacobson said the averages indicate at least one of the teams usually comes from outside the top five seeds in each region. Four No. 8s have reached the Final Four, and five No. 11s have made it.“This data says that yeah, you want one or two No. 1s,"" Jacobson said ""You probably want a No. 2 also — sorry, Arizona — but after that, you want anything between a three and 11, and it’s pretty much of a crapshoot.“All the sports pundits say, ‘I can’t imagine any of the ones losing.' I guarantee they're going to lose. In fact, I guarantee two of them are going to lose and maybe three before we get to the Final Four.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839401,Penn State-Texas 2nd-round matchup carries plenty of meaning,"DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — Penn State has been historically more likely to play Texas on a national stage in a football bowl game than the NCAA Tournament.On Saturday night, the Midwest Region matchup between two gridiron giants will be on the hardcourt for the first meeting in men’s basketball.It just may present one of the most intriguing — and meaningful — second round games.The teams are coming off sharp debuts in Des Moines, particularly on defense and from the 3-point line. Both programs, in their own way, would experience a sense of satisfaction from reaching the second weekend of the tournament.Then there are their beloved head coaches.Penn State (23-13) took a big step forward in Micah Shrewsberry's second season, reaching the Big Ten Tournament championship game and posting the first NCAA Tournament win in 20 years by disposing of Texas A&M on Thursday night.Shrewsberry has been mentioned as a candidate for high-profile openings at Georgetown and Notre Dame, but the 10th-seeded Nittany Lions would love to make his case for a long-term raise to make Penn State his permanent home.“When the season ends, I have time to think about things like that. Right now, I've got my hands full with Texas and how are we going to guard Marcus Carr. I’ve been on the wrong side of some Marcus Carr scoring outbursts when he was at Minnesota,” Shrewsberry said on Friday, referring to his two years as an assistant at Purdue. “Once we crack that code we will be thinking about other things later.”Texas (27-8) has also been playing for a greater purpose, in a quest to get the interim tag removed from Rodney Terry's title after he replaced Chris Beard in a tumultuous start to this season. The Longhorns matched their season high with 13 made 3-pointers in their win over Colgate, shutting down the nation's best outside shooting team and giving Terry his first career NCAA Tournament victory.“When the leader at the head is someone who is calm and poised it makes it that much easier for me as a point guard to continue to be calm and poised,” Carr said. “It just flows throughout the whole entire team. He does a great job of that.”The Longhorns have not advanced past the second round since 2008. Their last trip to the Final Four was in 2003, when Terry was an assistant coach.The Nittany Lions have had far less success as a program, with just five NCAA Tournament appearances in the last 58 years. Their 2019-20 team would have made it had the pandemic not canceled the tournament that year — another source of motivation for this group. Myles Dread and Seth Lundy — two of their top five scorers this season — have stuck around since then.“Being a part of that team was definitely something special. Me and Myles’ relationship with those guys is like no other,” Lundy said. “It was a very connected team, and we’re still connected to this day.”HOME COURT ADVANTAGE?This sure doesn't seem fair. Houston is the top seed in the Midwest Region, but the Cougars (32-3) will essentially be the road team when they face ninth-seeded Auburn in the second round at Legacy Arena in Birmingham, Alabama.The Tigers, after all, will be playing in their home state, just a two-hour drive from their campus in east Alabama. The issue has become such a talking point that the NCAA felt compelled to release a statement explaining how it assembles the brackets.“By principle, the Division I men’s basketball committee protects the top four seeds in each region against a home-court disadvantage in the first round of the tournament,” the NCAA said. “The committee does not adjust from its bracketing principles for the purpose of avoiding a potential home-court disadvantage beyond the first round.”Auburn (21-12) is thrilled to be playing so close to home, though the players were quick to point out on Friday that they had nothing to do with putting these pairings together.“It wasn’t our fault that we got picked as the ninth seed and ended up in Birmingham,” guard Zep Jasper said. “That’s what we were hoping for, but we didn’t know we were going to be in Birmingham.”For Tigers guard Wendell Green Jr., any complaints just sound like ready-made excuses for the Cougars to fall back on if they spring the upset. Houston is a 5 1/2-point favorite, per FanDuel Sportsbook odds.“But that’s nothing we can control,” Green said. ""We can only control what we can. They put us in Birmingham. It’s just a great opportunity for us.”Houston appears vulnerable after scraping by 16th-seeded Northern Kentucky in a 63-52 victory in the first round on Thursday, especially when All-American guard Marcus Sasser pulled himself out of the game in the first half because of nagging discomfort with his groin muscle.Sasser was first injured last weekend in the American Athletic Conference Tournament. He had five points in 14 minutes against Northern Kentucky, but said Friday he’ll be ready to go against the Tigers.Houston’s players shrugged off playing in Auburn’s backyard, stressing that they’ve thrived away from home all season. Indeed, the Cougars are 16-1 in road and neutral-site games, their only loss coming in the AAC final when Sasser sat out.“The luck of the draw,” point guard Jamal Shead said. “They got a lucky draw.”Houston coach Kelvin Sampson said he hopes Alabama’s sizable contingent in the 17,000-seat arena will help even out the support. The Crimson Tide, who have the top seed in the South Region, will be playing the late game against Maryland. Alabama and Auburn are bitter rivals, of course.“We’re playing Auburn,” Sampson said, mentioning the early-evening start time. “Let’s go. We need some help. Roll Tide!”___AP Sports Writer Paul Newberry contributed from Birmingham, Alabama.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839402,Ukraine war: International court issues warrant for Putin's arrest,"The International Criminal Court (ICC) on Friday issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin, alleging Moscow's forcible deportation of Ukrainian children is a war crime, as the Kremlin reacted with outrage.Russia has not concealed a programme under which it has brought thousands of Ukrainian children to Russia but presents it as a humanitarian campaign to protect orphans and children abandoned in the conflict zone.Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the move would lead to ""historic accountability"", adding that the deportations constituted a policy of ""state evil which starts precisely with the top official of this state.""The announcement provoked a furious response from Moscow. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia found the very questions raised by the ICC ""outrageous and unacceptable"", and that any decisions of the court were ""null and void"" with respect to Russia. Russia, like the United States and China, is not a member of the ICC.""Yankees, hands off Putin!"" wrote parliament Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin, a close ally of the president, on Telegram.""We regard any attacks on the president of the Russian Federation as aggression against our country,"" he said.The United States said there was ""no doubt"" Russia was committing war crimes in Ukraine. The court also issued a warrant for Maria Lvova-Belova, Russia's commissioner for children's rights, on the same charges.Putin, only the third serving president to have been issued an arrest warrant by the ICC, is unlikely to end up in court any time soon. But the warrant means that he could be arrested and sent to The Hague if he travels to any ICC member states.""This makes Putin a pariah. If he travels he risks arrest. This never goes away. Russia cannot gain relief from sanctions without compliance with the warrants,"" said Stephen Rapp, former U.S. ambassador-at-large for war crimes.Residents of the Russian capital expressed disbelief at the news. ""Putin! Nobody will arrest him,"" a man who gave his name only as Daniil, 20, told Reuters.Maxim said, ""We will protect him - the people of Russia.""BEIJING, MOSCOW TIESMoscow's forces have been accused of multiple abuses during Russia's year-old invasion of its neighbour Ukraine, including by a U.N.-mandated investigative body that this week described soldiers making children watch loved ones being raped.Moscow has repeatedly denied accusations its forces have committed atrocities during the invasion, which it calls a special military operation.ICC prosecutor Karim Khan began investigating possible war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide in Ukraine a year ago. He said he was looking at alleged crimes against children and the targeting of civilian infrastructure.News of the arrest warrant came ahead of a planned state visit to Moscow next week by Chinese President Xi Jinping which is likely to cement much closer ties between Russia and China just as relations between Moscow and the West hit new lows.Beijing and Moscow struck a ""no limits"" partnership shortly before the invasion, and U.S. and European leaders have said they are concerned Beijing may send arms to Russia.China has denied any such plan, criticising Western weapon supplies to Ukraine, which will soon extend to fighter jets after Poland and Slovakia this week approved deliveries. The Kremlin said the jets would be destroyed and not change the course of the conflict.China is keen to deflect Western criticism over Ukraine, but its close ties to Russia and its refusal to label Moscow’s war an invasion have fuelled scepticism about the prospect that Beijing might act as a mediator in the conflict.White House national security spokesman John Kirby said on Friday the United States had deep concerns China might try to promote a ceasefire because that would not currently lead to a just and lasting peace between Ukraine and Russia.BAKHMUT FIGHTINGUkrainian forces continued on Friday to withstand Russian assaults on the ruined city of Bakhmut, the focal point for eight months of Russian attempts to advance through the industrial Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine bordering Russia.Bakhmut has become Europe's bloodiest infantry battle since World War Two. Russian forces have captured the city's eastern part but have so far failed to encircle it.The General Staff of Ukraine's armed forces said Russia had carried out 19 airstrikes and 26 rocket attacks on Friday.Russian forces also conducted four air strikes on the frontline town of Avdiivka south of Bakhmut on Friday, Yermak, the Ukrainian presidential staff chief, wrote on Telegram.

(AP) — Elena Rybakina fired seven aces in routing top-ranked Iga Swiatek 6-2, 6-2 on Friday to advance to the BNP Paribas Open final.“I’m pretty sad that I lost,” Swiatek said.Rybakina will play second-seeded Aryna Sabalenka, who beat Maria Sakkari 6-2, 6-3, in Sunday's final in the Southern California desert.“It’s going to be huge,” said Sabalenka, who won the doubles title in 2019. “This tournament feels like a Grand Slam. I really want to hold this trophy as a singles champion.”Rybakina needed just 76 minutes to finish off Swiatek, the defending champion. She won 82% of her first-serve points, while Swiatek only managed 42%. Rybakina also beat the Polish star at the Australian Open in January on her way to finishing runner-up.“I didn’t expect that I was going to play that good today,” Rybakina said. “I had nothing to lose, I just wanted to come and enjoy. I played one of the best matches this year.”Swiatek had won 10 straight matches in the desert until being stopped by Rybakina's powerful groundstrokes that repeatedly rushed Swiatek and forced her into uncharacteristic errors.Swiatek double-faulted to lose the first set. Then she fell behind 5-0 in the second before rallying to win two games.“I feel like I can play great tennis even against players who are serving pretty fast and everything,” she said. “But for sure the last couple of matches against Elena, they weren’t perfect for me.”Swiatek said her rib was bothering her during the match.“I still have to run some tests and see what's going on. I don't know yet,” she said, adding that for now she plans to play next week in Miami.Sabalenka, the Australian Open champion, improved to 17-1 this year.She leads Rybakina 4-0 in their career meetings, but all four have gone to a deciding set, including in the final Down Under.“It was a really close match in Australia,” Rybakina said on court. “If I’m going to play like I did today, I think I have all the chances.”Sabalenka took control against Sakkari, seeded seventh, from the start. She attacked the Greek's second serve, winning 20 of 26 points off it. Sakkari, runner-up in last year's final, fell to 3-5 in her career against Sabalenka.Sakkari reached the semifinals by rallying from a set down three times and going 4-0 in deciding sets.But Sabalenka was too dominant. She won the final three games, including two service breaks, to take the first set, 6-2.Sabalenka led 2-0 in the second before Sakkari tied it 2-all. From there, Sabalenka won four of the final five games to close out the match in 1 1/2 hours.“Just super happy right now,” Sabalenka said on court.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839407,SVB Financial seeks bankruptcy protection as banking turmoil persists,"SVB Financial Group SIVB.O said on Friday it filed for a court-supervised reorganization under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to seek buyers for its assets, days after its former unit Silicon Valley Bank was taken over by U.S. regulators.The move to commence bankruptcy proceedings comes as emergency measures to shore up confidence have so far failed to dispel worries about a financial contagion.Shares of big banks fell between 1.5% and 3% in early trading.Financial stocks have lost over billions of dollars in value since the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank SBNY.O last week, while credit stress has worsened for Wall Street's biggest banks.""It is impossible to know if there are other shoes to drop, but I think a good majority of the negative news is out there,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management.Californian regulators shuttered Silicon Valley Bank last Friday and appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) as receiver, making it the largest collapse since Washington Mutual went bust during the financial crisis of 2008.SVB was forced to sell a portfolio of treasuries and mortgage-backed securities to Goldman Sachs at a $1.8 billion loss after a rise in yields eroded value.To plug that hole, it attempted to raise $2.25 billion in common equity and preferred convertible stock but spooked clients pulled out deposits that led to $42 billion of outflows in a day.Earlier this week, the company said it was planning to explore strategic alternatives for its businesses including the holding company, SVB Capital and SVB Securities.SVB Securities and SVB Capital's funds and general partner entities are not included in the Chapter 11 filing, the company said on Friday, adding it planned to proceed with the process to evaluate alternatives for the businesses, as well its other assets and investments.Reuters reported on Wednesday that the parent company was exploring seeking bankruptcy protection to sell its assets.The company said on Friday it has about $2.2 billion of liquidity. It had $209 billion in assets at the end of last year.(Reporting by Mehnaz Yasmin and Amruta Khandekar in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)",2023/3/18,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839415,Fairleigh Dickinson stuns No. 1 seed Purdue in March Madness,"COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Fairleigh Dickinson brought down a giant.Pulling off one of the biggest upsets in NCAA Tournament history, the undersized, underdog Knights stunned top-seeded Purdue 63-58 on Friday night, becoming the second No. 16 seed to win a game in March Madness.The shortest of the 363 Division I teams in the country, the Knights (21-15) showed no fear in swarming 7-foot-4 All-America center Zach Edey from the start and simply outplayed the Big Ten champion Boilermakers (29-6).“If we played them 100 times, they’d probably beat us 99 times,” FDU coach Tobin Anderson said. “Play them 100 times, we have one win. But tonight’s the one we had to be unique, we had to be unorthodox. We had to make it tough on them, just be different.”Sean Moore scored 19 points to lead FDU and a relentless defensive charge — the Knights pressed most of the game — by a team that now has everyone's attention.Five years ago, UMBC showed the way for the little guys by overwhelming Virginia in the first 16-over-1 victory after numerous close calls over the years. Still, No. 16s had a 1-150 record against No. 1s and were 1-151 overall before FDU’s shocker.After the final horn, FDU’s players mobbed each other on the floor of Nationwide Arena, where the fans from Memphis and Florida Atlantic who were waiting for the day's final game joined forces in cheering on the Knights in the final, frantic minutes.The Knights will meet FAU — a 66-65 winner over Memphis — on Sunday for a Sweet 16 berth and a trip next week to play at Madison Square Garden in New York, just a short drive from the private school’s main campus in Teaneck, New Jersey.“Man, I can’t even explain it,” Moore said. “I’m still in shock right now. I can’t believe it. It’s crazy. But it feels amazing.”Fairleigh Dickinson didn't even win the Northeast Conference Tournament, falling by one point in the title game to Merrimack, which couldn't participate in the NCAA Tournament because of an NCAA rule that bars it from the postseason because it's still completing its four-year transition from Division II.FDU held Purdue scoreless for more than 5 1/2 minutes down the stretch and moved ahead by five on a 3-pointer by Moore — who is from suburban Columbus — with 1:03 left.The Knights held on from there, becoming the third straight double-digit seed to send the Boilermakers home. Purdue was a No. 3 seed when it lost to No. 15 seed Saint Peter’s, another small New Jersey school, in the Sweet 16 last year. The Boilermakers were bounced in the first round by 13th-seeded North Texas in 2021.“Our job was just to come into the game and throw a punch,” said FDU's Demetre Roberts, 20 inches shorter than Edey. “We knew they would throw multiple punches. Just throw a punch back. We knew what type of game this was.”Edey finished with 21 points and 15 rebounds in what may have been his final college game, but the Knights were masterful against him in the second half. Edey didn't attempt a shot in the final nine minutes, and anytime he touched the ball there were FDU players draped all around him.“A lot of times they would have one dude guarding from behind and one dude basically sitting in my lap,” Edey said. “They were full fronting the entire game. Made it very hard to get catches. Credit to them, they had a great game plan coming in. And they executed it very well.”When Purdue’s late push fell short and its season ended, Edey squeezed the shoulder straps on his jersey and walked stone-faced toward Purdue’s locker room.The junior center is a possible NBA lottery pick, but the bitterness of this defeat could sway Edey to stick around for another year.“I have no opinion on that,” Edey said when asked about his future. “I’ll make my decision going forward.”The Knights' two prior NCAA Tournament wins came in the First Four, including this year, when they drubbed Texas Southern 84-61. After that game, Anderson told his players he believed they could handle Edey and Co.“The more I see Purdue, the more I think we can beat them,” Anderson said with a camera in the locker room.Some of Purdue’s players said they felt disrespected by the comments, which turned out to be prophetic.“It was the right message, wrong audience,” Anderson said. ""I would have said that with no camera in there. I didn’t mean to get Purdue upset. That was not the idea at all. But that’s got to be the message. We’re trying to win the next game. We just can’t be happy to be here.""“And the guys gotta believe.”Just being in the tourney was quite an accomplishment for FDU, which went 4-22 a year ago and now has two NCAA tourney wins in three days.This was Anderson’s first season at the school, and after he landed the job in May, he held a practice the first night just so he knew what he had to work with from a team that had the second-worst record in the program’s 58-year history.It wasn’t a lot, so he brought three players — Roberts, Grant Singleton and Moore — along with him from Division II power St. Thomas Aquinas.Turns out, they’re giant slayers.“We’re the shortest team in the country,” Anderson said. ""But we made him (Edey) uncomfortable. And the things he made were not easy baskets. I don’t think he ever felt terribly comfortable. And that was just a great team effort.""“We were sagging in the paint. We went off certain shooters. Let’s make them make 3s, but not give them 3s -- make them make 3s. Just an unbelievable team effort.”Purdue finished 5 of 26 from beyond the arc — including 3 of 15 in the second half.It was the Boilermakers, not the undersized Knights, who were scrambling from the opening tip.Purdue may have had Fairleigh Dickinson outsized on the floor and in the stands as a boisterous group of Boilermakers fans gave their team what felt like a home-court advantage despite being 240 miles from West Lafayette, Indiana.However, when the Knights’ Joe Munden drained a step-back 3-pointer in the first half, “F-D-U!” chants broke out inside the arena and it became obvious this small team had big dreams.Without a player on its roster taller than 6-6, Fairleigh Dickinson sometimes needed two players to guard Edey — one in front and one behind — and he missed his first three shots before a dunk.Edey showed some frustration and at one point told one of the officials, “Sir, he’s holding my left arm.”Purdue eventually settled in and reeled off 11 straight points — four on Edey free throws — to take 24-19 lead. The Knights, though, responded with their own spurt and Heru Bligen’s layup after a steal helped FDU take a 32-31 into halftime.Roberts finished with 12 points and 6-4 forward Cameron Tweedy had 10 points on 5-of-6 shooting for FDU.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/18,,World

(AP) — Gilberto “Zurdo” Ramirez badly missed weight for his scheduled fight with Gabriel Rosado on Friday, and their light heavyweight bout has been canceled.Ramirez (44-1, 30 KOs) was scheduled to return from the first defeat of his professional career as the headliner Saturday night at the Pyramid in Long Beach, California. Instead, Ramirez missed weight so badly that he didn't even attempt to get on the scale at the official weigh-in to see if he could make the 175-pound limit.“No excuses,” Ramirez wrote in a post on his Instagram account. “I had never missed weight in my 45 pro fights. This is the first and last time. I have always prided myself on being a professional, but today was not my finest moment.”Ramirez lost to Dmitry Bivol by unanimous decision in Abu Dhabi last November in a bout for the WBA light heavyweight title. He reigned as the WBO's super middleweight champion from 2016 to early 2019, when he relinquished the belt to move up to 175 pounds.The 31-year-old Ramirez, a Mexican fighter who trains in Los Angeles, was a heavy favorite against Rosado, a tough veteran from Philadelphia moving up to light heavyweight for the first time. Ramirez and Rosado are friends and former sparring partners.The Golden Boy fight card in Long Beach will proceed with former super featherweight world champion Joseph Diaz Jr. taking on Mercito Gesta at super lightweight in the main event.___AP boxing: https://apnews.com/hub/boxing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/18,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839422,"Embiid scores 38 in romp, 76ers rout Hornets 121-82","CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — Joel Embiid had 38 points and 13 rebounds in just 29 minutes, and the Philadelphia 76ers beat the Charlotte Hornets 121-82 on Friday night for their seventh straight victory.Embiid scored 12 points in each of the first two quarters before calling it an early night in a game the 76ers (47-22) led by 42 points in the second half.Embiid also had five assists and four blocked shots and was serenaded in each half with chants of “MVP! MVP!” by the many 76ers fans in a sellout crowd of 19,096 at Charlotte’s Spectrum Center.“One of our goals was to come in from the start and set the tone and not play in the fourth quarter,” Embiid said. “I’m glad we did it. We came out aggressive, starting on defense (in the second half). We did a pretty good job in the first half but we knew we had a little more left and we tried to corrected the mistakes that we had made.”James Harden had 11 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists for Philadelphia, which also got 18 points and five rebounds from Tobias Harris, 13 points from Tyrese Maxey and 12 points from Shake Milton.“It was a professional win,” 76ers coach Doc Rivers said. “They’re struggling a little bit and we just attacked. I liked how we played defensively and I liked how we moved the ball.”Terry Rozier scored 14 points, P.J. Washington had 12 points and six rebounds, and Kelly Oubre Jr. finished with 11 points for Charlotte (22-50).“They went 9-0 to start the third, and that was the biggest problem area,” Charlotte Hornets coach Steve Clifford said. “Again, (we were) impatient on offense, (we were) trying to challenge Embiid at the rim. Not good decision making in the paint, which has been a problem, and then they scored at the other end. I thought that was the key stretch.”EFFICIENT EMBIIDEmbiid had an efficient effort before he was pulled for good late in the third quarter. The 7-foot, 280-pound center converted 16 of 21 field goals and made six of seven free throws.“I like what he’s doing,” Rivers said. “He’s scoring and tonight he had 38 points in under three quarters. But he’s also dominating the game on the other end and he’s making the right passes. He’s including his teammates. He’s not forcing anything. He’s doing everything out of the flow of the game and it’s happening naturally, organically. And, defensively, he’s been dominant.”TIP-INS76ers: Jalen McDaniels, acquired in trade from the Hornets on Feb. 9, wasn’t able to play in the city where he started his career. He missed his second straight game due to a right hip contusion.Hornets: Rozier celebrated his 29th birthday. And, as a person born on St. Patrick’s Day, Rozier has a “3-17” tattoo on the back of his head.UP NEXT76ers: At Indiana on Saturday.Hornets: Host Indiana on Monday.",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839423,"Without Brink, Stanford reaches 2nd round of March Madness","STANFORD, Calif. (AP) — For months, Tara VanDerveer prepared every player on her roster to make an impact in March — whether as a starter or playing key bursts off the bench.The Hall of Fame coach counted on everybody's best efforts after star Cameron Brink got sick and had to sit out.Haley Jones scored 17 points for a top-seeded Stanford team missing Brink because of a stomach bug, and the Cardinal advanced to the second round of the NCAA Tournament by beating 16th-seeded Sacred Heart 92-49 on Friday night.Freshman Talana Lepolo dished out seven assists in her NCAA debut as Stanford advances to the second round Sunday against No. 8 seed Ole Miss (24-8) for a place at the Sweet Sixteen in Seattle next weekend. The Rebels held ninth-seeded Gonzaga to a season-low points in a 71-48 win in Friday's late game.“We needed this, for our team, to kind of bust out a little bit and remind ourselves this is what we can do,” VanDerveer said.Stanford, earning a No. 1 seed for a third straight year, notched the program’s 100th NCAA Tournament victory — third most all-time behind Tennessee and UConn. The Cardinal (29-5) have reached the Sweet 16 in 14 consecutive tournaments and haven’t lost in the first two rounds since falling to Florida State at home in 2007.Freshman Ny’Ceara Pryor scored 12 points to lead cold-shooting Sacred Heart (19-14), which overcame a 2-9 start to the season, won its first NCAA Tournament game and kept surprising all the way to March and extended its visit to the Bay Area.Without Brink, VanDerveer leaned on her post depth. Seniors Francesca Belibi and Ashten Prechtel played more minutes and 6-foot-7 freshman Lauren Betts blocked three shots and was relied upon regularly in the paint.“I learned from the best, Cameron is one of the best shot-blockers ever,” Betts said.Belibi started in place of Brink and in Brink-like fashion swatted a 3-point try by Kelsey Wood in the closing minutes of the first half. Belibi wound up with 12 points and 10 rebounds.“It is really different not having Cam out there,” VanDerveer said.Well-rested Stanford played one week after squandering a 16-point lead in a semifinal loss to UCLA at the Pac-12 Tournament in Las Vegas following a conference regular-season crown.The Cardinal grabbed the bracket's final No. 1 seed — and VanDerveer knew many people weren’t sure Stanford deserved a top seed. Her team used that as fuel and motivation on the way to a 14th straight home win.Stanford made its final seven field goals of the first quarter, with Jones corralling a defensive rebound then going coast to coast for a layup and getting fouled before scoring on a reverse layup the next time down.The Cardinal shot 10 of 14 in the opening quarter for a 23-18 lead then went on a 10-0 run in the second to take control as the Pioneers missed five straight shots.“That will stay with me for the rest of my life, we stayed with Stanford in the first quarter,” Pryor said.Scrappy Sacred Heart wanted nothing more than to leave a mark during this postseason journey, pulling off the program's first NCAA win by beating Southern 57-47 in a First Four game here Wednesday night. Then, Mannetti started three freshmen against the Cardinal.“I will never forget all that we've gone through these last two weeks,” Sacred Heart coach Jessica Mannetti said. 'I will never forget playing here at Stanford.""But it has now been 25 years since Stanford lost as a No. 1 seed to 16th-seeded Harvard right here on campus — and VanDerveer was determined not to have a repeat.“They are absolutely relentless,” Mannetti said. “It was certainly a different experience. We have never played a team at this high of a level.”JUMP'S FEATHannah Jump’s 3 to beat the halftime buzzer gave her 97 3-pointers this season, breaking the single-season mark previously held by Karlie Samuelson and Jeanette Pohlen.Jump finished with 12 points on four 3s.BRINK OUTStanford made the announcement about 50 minutes before tipoff that Brink, the Cardinal's leading scorer, rebounder and shot blocker, was out because of a non-COVID illness.The junior forward’s status is day-to-day.“Not how I expected March Madness to start but cheering my girls on today. Just a stomach bug & I’ll be back asap,"" Brink posted on her Instagram account.The school’s career blocks leader, the 6-foot-4 Brink is averaging 14.9 points, 9.5 rebounds, 3.4 blocks and 1.9 assists. Her 111 blocks rank second in the nation.BIG PICTURESacred Heart: Emotional at the end Friday, Mannetti had hundreds of congratulatory text messages to go through after Wednesday's win, and she planned to respond as her timing allowed. ... The Pioneers talked about how that 1998 Harvard team pulled off the unthinkable beating Stanford on its home floor. In fact, Manetti mentioned how league opponent Stonehill is coached by former Harvard assistant Trisha Brown who was part of that upset. Stanford: Sophomore Kiki Iriafen added nine points and five rebounds while Indya Nivar scored 11 points. ...

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839424,Capitals' playoff hopes take another hit with loss to Blues,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Sammy Blais scored twice, Joel Hofer made 33 saves in his season debut and the St. Louis Blues dealt the Washington Capitals a significant blow in their long-shot bid for a playoff spot with a 5-2 victory Friday night.The Capitals missed an opportunity to make up ground in the race for an Eastern Conference wild-card spot against an opponent long out of it in the West. They trail the Pittsburgh Penguins and New York Islanders by five points with 12 games left to play.“We have no wiggle room,” winger Conor Sheary said. ""The fact that we weren’t able to come out and be ready for this one and try to move up the standings is unfortunate. So, at this point, we got to get rolling, and if we don’t it’s going to end quickly for us.”Their odds of making it would have been even slimmer if not for a comeback victory in a shootout against Buffalo on Wednesday, but each regulation loss makes the climb more difficult. Coming up empty in a listless, mistake-heavy loss to St. Louis does just that.“Sometimes you get a nice comeback like last game, but it’s too hard,” center Nicklas Backstrom said. “It’s too hard in this league to just chase every game. It’s not doable.”There was plenty of blame to go around for Washington.Trade deadline pickup Rasmus Sandin — one of two additions amid a selloff — was on the ice for four goals against, and some poor puck management all around gave the Blues quality chances. Darcy Kuemper allowed at least one soft goal among the four he gave up on 21 shots behind a defense missing Nick Jensen because of injury.At the other end, the Capitals got third period goals from Martin Fehervary and Nicklas Backstrom against Hofer, a rookie playing just his third NHL game after starter Jordan Binnington was suspended for throwing a punch in the Blues' last game.""It was fun. I had a blast out there,"" Hofer said. ""There’s obviously a lot of uncertainties with being in the (American Hockey League) all year and the first game in a long time, but I thought the guys played really well in front of me and kind of kept them to the outside. It’s super nice to get the win.”St. Louis again got contributions from all three reclamation projects acquired in deals prior to the deadline: the goals from Blais and one from Kasperi Kapanen and an assist from Jakub Vrana on Jordan Kyrou's team-leading 31st of the season. Brayden Schenn sealed it with a long-distance empty netter with 1:39 left.Vrana, who was drafted by the Capitals and helped them win the Stanley Cup in 2018 and was traded to Detroit in 2021, has five points in six games since joining the Blues from the Red Wings earlier this month.Now with six goals since going back to the Blues from the New York Rangers, Blais has outscored longtime Blues winger Vladimir Tarasenko since the trade.“It’s been feeling good being back here and finding my confidence back a little bit,"" Blais said. ""Just happy it’s been working out well.”UP NEXTBlues: Host the Winnipeg Jets on Sunday night.Capitals: Visit the Minnesota Wild on Sunday afternoon.___Follow AP Hockey Writer Stephen Whyno on Twitter at https://twitter.com/SWhyno___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/18,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839427,Tshiebwe's 25 boards helps Kentucky top Providence in NCAAs,"GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) — Oscar Tshiebwe kept battling for position, pushing his way to daylight and grabbing seemingly every loose rebound with a rugged relentlessness.No one was going to stop him, either.When it was over, the two-time Associated Press All-American had turned in the best rebounding performance in the NCAA Tournament in nearly a half-century — and Kentucky was free to move past last year's one-and-done showing.Tshiebwe pulled down 25 rebounds and Antonio Reeves scored 22 points, helping the Wildcats beat Providence 61-53 in Friday night's first round.Tshiebwe's rebounding output represented the most in any tournament game since 1977. Eleven of his rebounds came on the offensive glass — a big factor in the sixth-seeded Wildcats (22-11) staying in control as both offenses grinded to a halt after halftime.“I told (my teammates), I said, ‘This year we come in and fight, last year doesn’t matter anymore,'"" said Tshiebwe, who entered as the nation's leading rebounder at 13.1 per game.The “last year,"" of course, was the shocking first-round exit against 15th-seeded Saint Peter's that had hung over the program all season. Now the Wildcats are moving on to face third-seeded Kansas State on Sunday in the East Region.“Yeah, it was a big relief obviously,” forward Jacob Toppin said.When the horn sounded, guard Cason Wallace let out a scream before giving a chest bump to Reaves. And Tshiebwe soon emerged from a postgame TV interview by gleefully skipping his way off toward the locker room.His rebounding total was the most in the tournament since Michigan's Phil Hubbard had 26 boards against Detroit Mercy in 1977.Behind Tshiebwe, Kentucky finished with a 48-31 rebounding advantage, controlling the offensive glass (plus-10) and dominating in second-chance points for an 18-2 edge.That was vital considering shots weren't falling; Kentucky shot 36.5% overall but just 7 of 28 (25%) after halftime.Reeves hit five 3-pointers to lead the offense, while Toppin had his own big game with 18 points. Tshiebwe managed eight points, but he was still an indomitable force that the 11th-seeded Friars (21-12) just couldn't manage.“Sometimes you just have an ‘it,’ a la Dennis Rodman, Ben Wallace,” Providence coach Ed Cooley said. “Those guys just have an ‘it’ for it. Some guys have an ‘it’ to score. Some people have an ‘it’ to pass. He has an incredible ‘it,’ an elite ‘it’ to rebound.""Ed Croswell scored 16 points for Providence, which shot just 36.2% while making 5 of 24 3-pointers. The Friars matched the Wildcats' second-half troubles, making just 8 of 27 shots (29.6%).“You can say you wish you could win this game and all that,"" Friars guard Jared Bynum said, ""but you have to embrace the moment at the end of it.”BIG PICTUREProvidence: The Friars have been to the NCAAs seven times in the past nine seasons under Cooley, including last year's Sweet 16 before falling to eventual champion Kansas. But they entered this game just 3-6 in NCAA games under Cooley.Kentucky: The Wildcats got off to a successful though grinding start to March Madness — and that was good enough for coach John Calipari.“If in this tournament, winning is a relief, what the heck are you doing here?"" he said. “This is joy.""KEY STRETCHTshiebwe came through in a tight game, starting with — what else? — his rebounding.With Kentucky leading 50-46, he leapt to dunk home Wallace's missed drive. Minutes later, he came up with a steal, then an offensive rebound off his own miss before feeding Chris Livingston on the other side of the paint for the layup and a 54-46 lead with 2:43 left.BUMPY REUNIONThe game marked a reunion between Providence star Bryce Hopkins and the Kentucky program he left behind. Hopkins came in averaging 16.1 points, but finished with just seven on 2-for-9 shooting in a tough night while being chased primarily by Toppin.Hopkins fought back tears as he made his way through the postgame handshake line with Calipari and former teammates.FULL STOPThe game's oddest moment came at the foul line.With 8:36 left before halftime, Providence's Clifton Moore launched a free throw that hit the rim on the left side and rolled all the way around the inside of the rim before popping out and sitting on the back of the goal.And then, it just stopped and stayed there.The 6-foot-9 Toppin stood next to an official under the net looking up at the ball, his hands on his hips, before jumping to tap it loose.It went down as a miss. Moore made the second.LOOK-INSThe upset by 16th-seeded Fairleigh Dickinson against No. 1 seed Purdue in Columbus, Ohio, drew a captivated audience in Greensboro Coliseum for live look-ins being shown on the scoreboard.During one timeout, with Fairleigh Dickinson up five in the final seconds, fans in Greensboro began chanting “FDU! FDU!” and booing whenever the game was taken off the scoreboard even when Providence-Kentucky had resumed on the court below.___Follow Aaron Beard on Twitter at https://twitter.com/aaronbeardap___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/18,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839431,Gonzaga wears down Grand Canyon 82-70 in March Madness,"DENVER (AP) — Slow-starting Gonzaga finally shook off the first-round jitters, then wore out Grand Canyon 82-70 behind 28 points and 10 rebounds from Julian Strawther in the NCAA Tournament on Friday.Zags senior Drew Timme brought his sweatband and moustache back to March Madness and finished with 21 points, six rebounds and three blocks for the third-seeded Bulldogs (29-5), who haven't lost a first-round game in the tournament since 2008.Next up for Gonzaga is a game Sunday against TCU, which got a last-second shot from JaKobe Coles to top Arizona State 72-70 in the evening's late contest.Like almost every Zag outside of Strawther, Timme was bottled up and frustrated in the first half, then came out of halftime and looked like a different player. After trailing by as many as seven, Timme's three-point play gave Gonzaga a 48-40 lead early in the second half.“As I walked into the locker room, Drew was talking to guys about ‘Hey, now the jitters are out of the way and now we’ve got to play,’” coach Mark Few said about halftime. “I thought we came out, certainly for that first 15 minutes in the second half, and we got back to the plan.”Grand Canyon's Ray Harrison answered Timme's three-point play with a driving layup. After that, Gonzaga went on a 16-0 run during which the 14th-seeded Lopes (24-12), champions of the Western Athletic Conference, missed 11 straight shots and fell behind by 22.With the game a laugher, the rowdy “Havocs,” as the Grand Canyon fans are known, turned their attention to the end of No. 16 seed Fairleigh Dickinson's shocker over No. 1 Purdue playing on the big screen above the court.But there was no upset in Denver.“I told our guys 'Eyes on the court. We don't need another circus show going on, we've got one going on here right now,'"" Timme said.Harrison led Grand Canyon with 20 points and Chance McMillian had 16. Noah Baumann (eight points) made a pair of 3s during a 12-4 stretch that helped the Lopes to their seven-point lead in the first half.Strawther, who decided to come back to Gonzaga for his junior season instead of heading to the pros, kept Gonzaga in it early. He scored 16 of his 28 in the first half.The second half was more of a team effort for Gonzaga, which also got 14 points, 11 rebounds and a rugged defensive effort from Anton Watson that included two steals.In the end, the game was a lot like Gonzaga’s season — slow start, better as things kept going and a chance to do more. The Bulldogs had their 75-game home winning streak snapped in January and this marked the first time since 2018 they came into the tournament as anything other than a No. 1 seed.“I thought we were in a good place going into halftime,” Lopes coach Bryce Drew said. “But Gonzaga’s one of the best programs in the nation for a reason.”NOT AGAINHarrison led Grand Canyon, a fifth seed in the WAC tournament, to four straight wins and the March Madness bid by becoming the first Division I player to collect 80 points, 20 rebounds and 20 assists in a conference tournament since Kemba Walker (Big East) in 2011. On Friday, though, Harrison was bottled up. He needed 19 shots to get his 20 points, and finished with two rebounds and three assists.NOT AGAIN, PART IIThis marks the 25th anniversary of Drew's memorable game-winner, when he was a guard for Valparaiso and shot the Crusaders to a 13-over-4 upset over Ole Miss. Nobody had a chance to replicate that for the Lopes, though. Still, this was Grand Canyon's second trip to the tournament since its move to Division I in 2017.“I wish we could skip a lot of steps and upset a team like Gonzaga and make the Sweet 16,” Drew said, “but in a normal situation, you have to go step by step.”ELLIS’ KIDWith his dad, LaPhonso Ellis, sitting in the stands, Walter Ellis had nine points before fouling out for Grand Canyon. LaPhonso Ellis, the former Notre Dame star, played in Denver for the Nuggets from 1992-98.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839432,Regulators: Nuclear plant leak didn't require public notice,"Minnesota regulators knew four months ago that radioactive waste had leaked from a nuclear power plant in Monticello — but they didn’t announce anything about the leak until this week.The delay in notifying the public about the November leak raised questions about public safety and transparency, but industry experts said Friday there was never a public health threat. They said Xcel Energy voluntarily notified state agencies and reported the leak of tritium to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission soon after it was confirmed and that the leak of 400,000 gallons (1.5 million liters) of radioactive water never reached a threshold that would have required public notification.“This is something that we struggle with because there is such concern with anything that is nuclear,” said Victoria Mitlyng, a spokesperson with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. “The concern is very, very understandable. That is why I want to make extra clear the fact that the public in Minnesota, the people, the community near the plant, was not and is not in danger.”State officials said that while they knew of the leak in November, they waited to get more information before making a public announcement.“We knew there was a presence of tritium in one monitoring well, however Xcel had not yet identified the source of the leak and its location,” Minnesota Pollution Control Agency spokesperson Michael Rafferty said Thursday. “Now that we have all the information about where the leak occurred, how much was released into groundwater and that contaminated groundwater had moved beyond the original location, we are sharing this information.""Tritium is a radioactive isotope of hydrogen that occurs naturally in the environment and is a common by-product of nuclear plant operations. It emits a weak form of beta radiation that does not travel very far and cannot penetrate human skin, according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety with the Union of Concerned Scientists, said a significant health risk would only occur if people consumed fairly high amounts of tritium. That risk is contained if the plume stays on the company’s site, which Xcel Energy and Minnesota officials said is the case.If regulatory officials are sure it didn’t move off site, people shouldn’t have to worry about their safety, he said, adding that companies usually take action when onsite monitoring wells detect elevated levels of contaminants like tritium.Mitlyng said there's no official requirement for nuclear plants to report all tritium leaks to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Instead, Xcel Energy had previously agreed to report certain tritium leaks to the state. When Xcel Energy shares information with the state, it also shares it with the commission.The commission posted a notification about the leak on its website Nov. 23, noting that the plant reported it to the state a day earlier. The report classified the leak as a nonemergency. The notice said the source of the tritium was being investigated at that time.Beyond that, there was no widespread notification to the public before Thursday.Rafferty said disclosure requirements fall to the facility, and state agencies would have notified residents immediately had there been an imminent threat to health and the environment.Rafferty said the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency decided to share information about its role overseeing the cleanup now “because we have more details about the location and potential movement of the contamination, steps being taken to control the plume and plans for remediation including short-term storage of contaminated water.”Mitlyng said there is no pathway for the tritium to get into drinking water. The facility has groundwater monitoring wells in concentric circles, and plant employees can track the progress of contaminants by looking at which wells detect higher amounts. There are Nuclear Regulatory Commission inspectors on site too, watching over the response.The company said the leak came from a pipe between two buildings.Xcel said it has recovered about 25% of the spilled tritium so far, that recovery efforts will continue and that it will install a permanent solution this spring.Xcel is considering building above-ground storage tanks for the contaminated water it recovers and is considering options for the treatment, reuse or final disposal of the collected tritium and water. State regulators will review the options the company selects, the state Pollution Control Agency said.The regulatory commission said tritium spills happen from time to time at nuclear plants, but they’ve either been limited to plant properties or involved such low offsite levels that they didn’t impact public health. Xcel Energy reported a small tritium leak at Monticello in 2009.The Monticello plant is about 35 miles (55 kilometers) northwest of Minneapolis, upstream from the city on the Mississippi River.Shelby Burma, who lives minutes from the site of the spill, said the news — coming weeks after a train derailment on the Ohio-Pennsylvania border left lingering concerns about contaminated air, soil and groundwater — makes her worry about an increasing amount of chemicals in the environment.“I think it’s pretty alarming that they did not notify the public right away,” Burma said. “They said it won’t cause any harm, but that’s hard to believe when they waited how long to go public with it.”___Phillis reported from New York City, Biraben from Pierre, South Dakota.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839433,Aston-Reese scores 2 as Maple Leafs beat Hurricanes 5-2,"TORONTO (AP) — Zach Aston-Reese scored twice and the Toronto Maple Leafs beat the Carolina Hurricanes 5-2 Friday night to snap a two-game skid.Morgan Rielly had a goal and an assist, and Mitch Marner and Auston Matthews also scored to help Toronto improve to 4-2-1 in its last seven games. John Tavares and Calle Jarnkrok each had two assists and Ilya Samsonov finished with 32 saves to help Toronto increase its lead to three points ahead of third-place Tampa Bay in the Atlantic Division.“When they were pressuring us hard, we did our job,” Marner said. “We bent a little bit, but didn’t break. We stayed to our structure. ... We got opportunities off it, and when we did, we didn’t miss.”Martin Necas and Brady Skjei each scored for Carolina in its third loss in four games. Pyotr Kochetkov had 19 saves as the Hurricanes remained one point ahead of second-place New Jersey in the Metropolitan Division.“A team with that skill level, you just can’t be giving them chances,” Hurricanes forward Jordan Martinook said. “You’ve got to be able to stick with your game plan and stay tight, stay above people, don’t let their skill guys get behind you. ... We let that happen too many times.”Aston-Reese got the scoring started as he tipped Erik Gustafsson's shot from the right point past Kochetkov 2:54 into the game.Marner made it 2-0 with 7 1/2 minutes left in the first as fired a shot from the right circle off the post and in for his 25th.Skjei got the Hurricanes on the scoreboard as his shot from the left circle bounced off his glove and over the line with 5:23 remaining in the period.Tavares fired a shot from the left side that deflected off Matthews' knee on the right side and in on the power play with 2:22 left in the first to make it 3-1. It was Matthews' 32nd.Necas pulled the Hurricanes within one again as he scored from the right circle with 9:15 left in the second. It was his 26th.Aston-Reese got his second of the night and seventh of the season with 5:01 left in the middle period as he redirected Sam Lafferty's cross-ice feed from the left side past Kochetkov to make it 4-2.“Always easy to play the rest of the game when you score on your first shift,” said Aston-Reese, who had one goal in his 23 previous games. “I was hoping for a third, but happy with the night.”Rielly scored from the left circle to give Toronto a three-goal lead at 8:56 of the third. It was his fourth.“Playoff-type of game feel in terms of both teams being conscious not to allow too much offense,” said Rielly, whose club was coming off Wednesday’s 2-1 shootout loss to defending Stanley Cup champion Colorado.SCHENN'S DEBUTMaple Leafs defenseman Luke Schenn played his first game at Scotiabank Arena as a member of the organization in nearly 4,000 days after he was reacquired from the Vancouver Canucks ahead of the NHL trade deadline.“In one regard, yes, it feels like another lifetime,” said the 33-year-old Schenn, who was drafted fifth overall by Toronto in 2008 before his trade to Philadelphia in 2012. “In the same breath, everything just is familiar.”Schenn received a nice ovation to start the game. He heard the old “Luuuuuke” chants rain down from the stands after a third-period hit on Sebastian Aho during a penalty kill.“It hasn’t been smooth sailing,” said the defenseman from Saskatoon. “But there’s no question that the fans have always been great to me.”ACCIARI OUTToronto lost Noel Acciari late in the first period when he took a blow up high in a collision with Carolina's Jesse Puljujarvi. The Maple Leafs, who were left with 10 forwards after once again dressing an extra defenseman, said the veteran center was held out for precautionary reasons.Acciari won’t play Saturday, but was in the locker room with teammates after the game.NEXT MAN UPThe Hurricanes played their second game without star forward Andrei Svechnikov, who suffered a season-ending knee injury last Saturday. Svechnikov had 23 goals and 32 assists in 64 games.UP NEXTHurricanes: At Philadelphia Flyers on Saturday.Maple Leafs: At Ottawa Senators on Saturday.___AP NHL: https://www.apnews.com/hub/NHL and https://www.twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/18,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839435,Pitino on St. John's: 'You don’t buy houses without looking',"ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — Rick Pitino insists he doesn't know his next move. He did give a pretty good hint about what's under consideration.After the 70-year-old Hall of Famer's 13th-seeded Iona team was knocked out of the NCAA Tournament by UConn on Friday, he addressed speculation that St. John's is targeting him as its next coach.He also said he didn't know if he had coached his last game with the Gaels.“I really don’t have an answer to it, to be honest with you. I have no idea if it is or isn’t because I’ve focused everything on this game, trying to develop a plan to beat Connecticut,” Pitino said.Pitino talked earlier this week about how much he admires St. John's President Rev. Brian Shanley, who previously worked at Providence.Pitino broke into the Big East as a head coach at Providence in 1986 and made one of the most memorable Final Four runs in tournament history with the Friars in 1987.St. John's, which fired Mike Anderson after the Big East Tournament, was a power in the conference back then, but the Red Storm have slipped into a long run of mediocrity over the last two decades.Pitino said he has no timetable on when he will make a decision about his future, and spoke directly to reports about St. John's interest.“I really haven’t put any thought into it at all,” Pitino said. ""I hear the question from you, and I think when you start thinking ahead, you always fail.“We put a lot of effort into this game. I don’t know. I don’t know if it’s right for me, another job. I don’t know that. It’s something, like I said before, I know you’re all alluding to St. John’s, but I’ve never seen St. John’s. Somebody sent me a clip.”Pitino told an anecdote about playing at St. John's in 1987, beating Lou Carnesecca's team and then pushing star guard Billy Donovan into the locker room shower because officials were still debating whether to put an extra second back on the clock.“That was the last thing I remember about being at St. John’s. That was 1987, guys, 1987,” Pitino said. ""So I don’t remember too much about it, to tell you the truth, to be perfectly transparent.“You don’t buy houses without looking at the garage and the upstairs and the kitchen and everything. You don’t just buy a house.”Pitino has won national championships with Kentucky and Louisville, but he was fired by Louisville before the 2017-18 season after an FBI investigation into college basketball led to allegations of NCAA violations.It was the third scandal, both personal and professional, in an eight-year period with Louisville.Ultimately, Pitino was exonerated in the FBI-related case — which he reminded everyone about at his postgame news conference Friday — five years after he was fired.“So for five years they put me in the outhouse because they couldn’t get their stuff together,” Pitino said.“So it’s just the breaks of the game. You can’t look back. The past, it’s always cherished. You learn from it, you cherish the past. I’ve been to seven Final Fours, two championships, and I cherish that. I also learn from the mistakes that were made,"" he said.Pitino is 64-22 in three years with Iona of the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference, including two NCAA Tournament appearances. The small Catholic school in New Rochelle, New York, just north of the city, hired him with the NCAA cloud still over his head, but it's a long way from the Big East.He lamented earlier this week the pressure of being in a one-NCAA bid conference. After getting routed by UConn in the second half, he talked about how the Gaels just couldn't match up physically with one of the best teams in the country.“The present is where we’re at right now, and it’s disappointing for my guys because they’re a great group of kids,” Pitino said. “In the future, I have really no idea what the future may bring because I’ve got to look at the grand scheme of things about winning, and winning is very important because we all work so hard, every coach works so hard.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839436,Tippett's hat trick leads Flyers past Buffalo 5-2,"PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Owen Tippett had his first career hat trick, Carter Hart made 34 saves and the Philadelphia Flyers defeated the Buffalo Sabres 5-2 on Friday night.James van Riemsdyk and Joel Farabee also scored, and Kevin Hayes and Tony DeAngelo each had two assists for Philadelphia. The Flyers snapped a four-game skid while winning for just the fourth time in 14 games since the All-Star break.“It’s pretty cool,” Tippett said. “It’s nice to get rewarded.”Tippett, a promising 24-year-old acquired last season at the trade deadline from Florida for Claude Giroux, reached 21 goals on the season.“He steps on the ice, he’s dangerous,” Flyers coach John Tortorella said. “We knew he was a good player. I think he thinks he’s a good player. I think he has a lot to learn still, but he’s made tremendous strides.”Victor Olofsson scored both goals for the Sabres, who lost for the eighth time in 11 games to further hurt their playoff chances. Buffalo entered six points back of a wild-card spot and needed to jump three teams.“We gotta get hot, we gotta get really hot,” Sabres captain Kyle Okposo said. “We gotta go on a run.”The Flyers began play with the fifth-fewest points in the NHL, and losing only helps their lottery chances in the Connor Bedard sweepstakes. Bedard is considered to be a lock for the No. 1 overall pick in the upcoming draft, and Philadelphia certainly could use his talents in its rebuilding process.But first-year coach Tortorella also acknowledged prior to Friday’s game that winning games – even if occasionally – also is an important part of development.The Flyers sure didn’t look like also-rans against slumping Buffalo.Tippett put Philadelphia ahead 1-0 with 4:50 left in the first on the power play with a rocket of a wrist shot high into the right corner past goalie Craig Anderson’s glove.He had the middle tally of Philadelphia’s impressive, three-goal second period on a one-timer just inside the right post after a stellar cross-ice pass from Hayes.And Tippett converted a breakaway 5:33 into the third period on a beautiful deke and then backhander after being set up with DeAngelo’s long pass from Philadelphia’s goal line.“Too big, too strong, great shot, good finisher,” DeAngelo said of Tippett. “It’s good to see somebody taking a step like that and just keep running with it.”Flyers fans, who haven’t had much to cheer about this season, littered the ice with hats, including many green top hats on St. Patrick’s Day.Olofsson netted his second with 0.4 seconds remaining on the power play.“Just a tough second (period) tonight,” Okposo said. “It’s just about playing your game and sticking to your game plan. It seemed like we cracked.”SABRES GM WELCOMES GOALIEBuffalo general manager Kevyn Adams is excited to have goalie Devon Levi join the club after signing the 21-year-old to a three-year entry level contract on Friday.“We just thought for his development, where we are right now, this was a critical time for him to learn and grow with us,” Adams said prior to Friday night’s game against Philadelphia. “And that’s he’s coming right in.”Levi recently completed his junior season at Northeastern, leading Hockey East goalies with 14 wins, six shutouts, a 1.81 goals-against average and a .947 save percentage.“We first got to get him up to speed and get him around the guys, get him comfortable,” Adams said. “You want to set players up for success. You want to put them in a situation that you believe they can thrive. We’re open to it and we’ll go day by day and once we feel that he’s comfortable and where he needs to be, then we’ll see where we’re at.”NOTES: Hayes, Philadelphia’s All-Star representative, moved within three points of Travis Konecny’s team lead of 54 points. … Konecny (upper body) missed his 10th straight. … Philadelphia blanked the Sabres 4-0 on Jan. 9 in Buffalo. … The Flyers improved to 13-16-4 at home, while Buffalo dropped to 20-11-3 on the road.UP NEXTSabres: Host Boston on Sunday afternoon.Flyers: Host Carolina on Saturday night.___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839437,Alaska education board asks state for transgender sports ban,"ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — The Alaska board of education has unanimously approved a resolution that urges the state to limit the participation of transgender girls in girls school sports.The resolution passed Thursday urges the Alaska Department of Education and Early Development to create two sports divisions, one for athletes whose sex assigned at birth is female and the other for students of all genders, the Anchorage Daily News reported.The resolution was added last-minute to the board’s agenda at the end of a three-day meeting in Juneau. It had unanimous support from the eight members, with the student adviser abstaining.Billy Strickland, the director of the Alaska School Activities Association, said the resolution closely matches what members of Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s administration discussed with him previously. He said they wanted to create three divisions: boys, girls and one co-ed division that would allow transgender athletes.Strickland said there aren't enough transgender athletes in Alaska to accommodate a third division. In fact, he said he was only aware of one transgender athlete in the nine years he has led the association.A statement emailed from Dunleavy’s office Friday said girls playing in single-sex leagues should be playing against other girls.“If a person who was born a male but feels out of place playing a sport in a league with boys only due to their gender identity, the solution isn’t to allow them to compete against girls, but to increase co-ed opportunities,"" the statement said. ”It’s time to seriously consider co-ed interscholastic sports so that all students can compete at their highest level.""Only the Matanuska-Susitna Borough School Board in Alaska has limited the participation of transgender athletes, Strickland said. School boards or districts set their policy, and most have not addressed the issue. Girls already frequently play alongside boys on some football or hockey teams.A message seeking a copy of the resolution from the state board was not immediately returned Friday to The Associated Press. But a copy obtained by the Anchorage newspaper urged the activities association to protect “the integrity of high school girls’ sports.”“We’re making a statement of keeping girls’ sports safe and competitive and fair, that’s all,” board chair James Fields told the Daily News.State Sen. Löki Tobin, an Anchorage Democrat who chairs the Senate Education Committee, said she was concerned the board violated its requirement to allow the public to weigh in on resolutions before a vote. She also expressed concerns the resolution could violate the right to privacy clause of the Alaska Constitution.The Legislature can revoke proposed regulations for any state department.“I am concerned primarily because I am the chair of the state policy committee for education in the Senate,” said Tobin. “I am concerned that the process just was not followed, and that we weren’t able to provide our public comment on this issue.”Dunleavy earlier this month proposed a bill that would require students to use bathrooms and locker rooms according to their sex assigned at birth, the newspaper reported. It would also require parental approval for students to change their name or pronouns they use in school. The Legislature has not voted on the bill.Another bill that would reserve sports divisions for boys and girls and create a separate co-education division also has not been heard.The Alaska state Senate has a bipartisan majority and has said it would steer clear this session of divisive issues, including those pertaining to LGBTQ+ people.",2023/3/18,,World

The Warriors (36-35) hold the sixth and final playoff spot in the Western Conference, only a half-game ahead of Minnesota.“I really think a lot of good is coming our way down the stretch, but we've got to get there,” Kerr said.The Hawks led 123-119 before Young's steal from Curry and layup stretched the advantage to six points.“They were trying to get the switch, trying to get the mismatch,” said Young, who had 25 points with 12 assists. “I just timed it perfectly.”John Collins had 22 points and Onyeka Okongwu added a season-high 19 as Atlanta snapped a two-game losing streak to remain eighth in the Eastern Conference playoff standings. Bogdan Bogdanovic, who signed a $68 million, four-year extension on Thursday, had 14 points while sinking four 3-pointers.The Warriors were without forward Draymond Green, who served an automatic one-game suspension without pay after being called for his 16th technical foul of the season in Wednesday night's 134-126 loss at the Los Angeles Clippers. Green drew the foul when he threw the ball off Russell Westbrook’s face late in the game.Jonathan Kuminga scored 10 points as the fill-in starter for Green.The Warriors fell to 7-28 on the road. They are 29-7 at home.“It's not mental,” Kerr said of his team's road struggles. “I think we're competing. We're playing pretty well. It's hard to win on the road in this league. We're just not getting it done.”Kerr said before the game “there's really no precedent I know of” for his team's drop in production on the road. He described the Warriors' poor 3-point defense in road games as “mind-boggling.”Golden State's opponents have made only 32.4% of 3-pointers in the Warriors' home games, compared to 40.8% on the road before facing Atlanta. The Hawks made 16 of 41 3s (39%).Asked before the game if he believed his team could solve its road woes, Kerr smiled and said: “I'm confident in the playoffs everybody is going to start missing 3s against us. I'm a believer.”STEALS AND TURNOVERSYoung's key steal was one of seven for the Hawks. The Warriors committed 17 turnovers, leading to 21 Atlanta points. The Hawks had 11 turnovers, leading to nine points.“At the end, that was kind of the difference but I can't fault the effort,” Kerr said.MARCH SADNESSKerr had no sympathy for a reporter who bemoaned No. 2 seed Arizona's 59-55 NCAA Tournament first-round loss to No. 15 Princeton on Thursday.“Ruined your bracket?” asked Kerr, a former Arizona player and coach, with a pained smile. “It ruined my day.”TIP-INSWarriors: Kevon Looney had 18 points and 16 rebounds. Klay Thompson had 15 points and 11 rebounds. ... F Anthony Lamb's two-way contract was converted to a standard contract. Kerr said he needed another wing player with Andre Iguodala (fractured left wrist) facing surgery next week and Andrew Wiggins (personal) also unavailable. Also, G Lester Quinones was signed to a two-way contract. ... Curry (left thumb soreness) was cleared to start following pregame warmups.Hawks: Collins set a career high for points in an opening period by scoring 17 of Atlanta's first 21 points. ... F Jalen Johnson (left hamstring tightness) did not play.

She has flourished with the Utes, turning into a matchup nightmare for opposing defenses.Pili tallied a career-high 33 points, eight rebounds and a career-high eight assists to power second-seeded Utah past 15th-seeded Gardner-Webb 103-77 Friday night in the first round of the women’s NCAA Tournament.A transfer from Southern California, the junior forward led the Pac-12 in scoring and field goal percentage during the regular season and never gave the Bulldogs a chance to breathe.“I just kind of let the game come to me and took advantage of those situations,” Pili said.Jenna Johnson added 20 points and five assists for the Utes (26-4). Pili and Johnson combined to make 22 of 31 shots as the Bulldogs struggled to keep the duo from relentlessly attacking the basket.The Utes advanced to play Princeton, which topped N.C. State 64-63.“We have so many weapons offensively, so I think if the defense takes away one, we can just have another one,” Johnson said. “So we’re getting a lot of points down low early and then when they try to collapse on us, we can kick it out and hit threes.Gardner-Webb (29-5) had a 21-game winning streak snapped and fell to 0-3 against Power 5 opponents this season. Jhessyka Williams scored 20 points for the Bulldogs.“I think our team fought extremely hard, especially in the third quarter. We tied the third quarter,” Gardner-Webb coach Alex Simmons said. “Obviously, Utah is a team that once they get in the flow, it’s tough to stop them.”Utah used a 14-0 run to carve out a 32-14 lead early in the second quarter. The Utes forced four turnovers over the final 3½ minutes of the first quarter to spark their game-breaking and held Gardner-Webb without a point for 4½ minutes.The Bulldogs cut Utah’s lead to 58-50 in the third quarter on a 3-pointer by Ki’ari Cain. That’s the only time the margin fell under double digits in the second half. Pili countered with a layup to spark a string of three straight baskets that pushed the Utes’ lead to 65-50.“I thought we controlled the game the whole time, but we had some peaks and valleys of great play and kind of loose play,” Utah coach Lynne Roberts said.Gianna Kneepkens chipped in 17 points and nine rebounds for Utah. The Utes shot 59% from the floor and had 32 assists on 37 baskets.Alaisia Smith added 14 points and eight rebounds for the Bulldogs before fouling out in the final minute of the third quarter. Cain had 14 points and six assists.Early foul trouble curbed the Bulldogs’ ability to play aggressive defense and put them in a deep hole before the end of the first quarter. Gardner-Webb racked up eight team fouls within the first six minutes of the game.“It’s kind of like we barely touched them and their whistles were blowing,” Williams said.MILESTONE MISSPili had a shot at earning her first career triple-double before checking out of the game for good with 4:15 left. Roberts decided the risks to her star weren’t worth padding a few stats once the game was in hand.“It’s tempting, but the smart thing to do is to rest and make sure there’s no injury,” Roberts said.BIG PICTURE Gardner-Webb: Williams brought her career scoring total to 2,049 points, moving her past Dina Smith for second place in program history. She came into the NCAA Tournament averaging a team-high 19.8 points per game.Utah: The Utes dominated around the basket from the opening tip. Utah clogged the lane on defense and attacked the paint nonstop on offense. The Utes outrebounded Gardner-Webb 44-30 and outscored the Bulldogs 60-26 in the paint. ___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/18,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839443,Taiwan's electricity prices to increase 11% in April,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Electricity prices are expected to increase by an average of 11%, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said on Friday (March 17), following Taipower’s NT$267.5 billion (US$8.74 billion) loss in 2022.The price hikes will be implemented on April 1, and will mainly affect high-use consumers in the industrial and commercial sectors, per CNA. The MOEA said that households using under 700 kWh, and small shops using under 1500 kWh will not be subject to the increases, meaning that 93% of residential buildings and 84% of small businesses will not be affected.Households and businesses exceeding the 700 and 1500 kWh thresholds will pay an extra 3% for power, up to 1000 and 3000 kWh respectively. Prices for residential use over 1000 kWh will increase by 10%, while prices for commercial use over 3000 kWh will increase by 5%.Educational institutions, from kindergartens through to universities, will not pay extra for electricity, according to the MOEA.Vice Minister of the MOEA Chuan-Neng Lin (林全能) said that despite the relative decline in global energy prices over recent months, prices were still generally high, causing the price hikes for Taiwan’s consumers. Lin said Taipower lost NT$1.20 for every kWh of energy sold in 2022.Taipower President Yao-Ting Wang (王耀庭) said that for residential consumers, electricity prices would increase 2.6% on average, and 14.2% on average for industrial users. Lin said that in addition to schools, the fisheries and agricultural sectors will not be subject to the increases, but this will be reviewed in the second half of the year.",2023/3/18,1904,Society

They trail the Pittsburgh Penguins and New York Islanders by five points with 12 games left to play.St. Louis got contributions from all three reclamation projects acquired in deals prior to the deadline: the goals from Blais and one from Kasperi Kapanen and an assist from Jakub Vrana on Jordan Kyrou’s team-leading 31st of the season. Brayden Schenn sealed it with a long-distance empty netter with 1:39 left.The Capitals got third period goals from Martin Fehervary and Nicklas Backstrom against Hofer, a rookie playing just his third NHL game after starter Jordan Binnington was suspended for throwing a punch in the Blues’ last game.

They built a 21-point lead in the second quarter and didn’t allow Washington to get closer than seven.“We’re doing a lot of good things right now and the biggest thing for us is to keep moving forward, step by step,” Mitchell said. “We’ve got to continue to push and start getting ready for April.”Cleveland (45-28) moved three games ahead of New York and 4 1/2 in front of Brooklyn in the battle for fourth place in the East and home-court advantage in the opening round of the playoffs. The Cavaliers’ next two games are in Brooklyn.The victory assured Cleveland of its winningest season since 2018, when it was swept in the NBA Finals by Golden State. Starting center Jarrett Allen missed his fourth straight game with a right eye contusion.“You can think ahead to the playoffs, but do it in a positive way and keep working toward that,” Mobley said. “I believe that will help you better yourself for the playoffs once they get started.”Bradley Beal scored 22 points and Kristaps Porzingis had 20 points and nine rebounds for the Wizards. Washington (32-38) lost for the sixth time in eight games and fell into a tie with Indiana and Chicago for the final East play-in tournament spot.The Cavaliers only made 4 of 19 3-pointers with Mitchell and Garland combining to miss their first 10 attempts. Caris LeVert had 15 points off the bench and Ricky Rubio added eight points and five assists.“We laugh about it as a staff because we just win differently than anybody else,” Cleveland coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. “Obviously, we wish more of those shots went in, but we have to do things different because of the way this team is constructed.”Wizards forward Kyle Kuzma had seven points after missing a game with a sore right knee. Corey Kispert scored 12 points and Monte Morris had 10 points, but Washington committed 17 turnovers that cost it 21 points.“Live-ball turnovers are lethal,” Wizards coach Wes Unseld Jr. said. “We don’t have a ton of individual shot creation, so it’s about ball movement.”CAUTIOUS COACH The Cavaliers’ magic number has been reduced to five for earning their first playoff berth without LeBron James on the roster since 1998. A total of five Cleveland wins and Miami losses would clinch it.“We’ve got to go out and finish what we’ve started,” Bickerstaff said. “That’s our focus.”Cleveland lost 10 of its final 13 games last season, including two in the play-in tournament, to finish 44-38 and extend its playoff drought to four years since James joined the Lakers.“We’re not finished getting better yet and that’s the fun part of it,” Bickerstaff said. “We have improved, but we still have room to grow.”TIP-INS Wizards: F Xavier Cooks -- named MVP of Australia’s National Basketball League last month -- signed a multi-year contract before the game.

Dallas got the ball to Irving, who drew a double-team and found Kleber for an open 3-pointer released just before the horn.Irving scored 13 points in the fourth quarter of his return from a three-game injury absence for the Mavs, who avoided falling into a three-way tie with the Lakers and the Timberwolves in the tight Western Conference standings.Davis had 26 points and 10 rebounds for the Lakers, who missed 12 of their 31 free throw attempts and couldn’t make a field goal in the final 3:16 of another blow to their playoff hopes. Los Angeles led by four points and had the ball in the final minute, but still lost for the third time in four games.LeBron James sat out his 10th straight game since the Lakers’ win in Dallas last month, and the Lakers fell to 5-5 without the NBA’s career scoring leader.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839466,Duke's return to March Madness comes as site host,"DURHAM, N.C. (AP) — It’s like a welcome-back party for Duke in the NCAA Tournament, complete with home amenities.Third-year coach Kara Lawson has the Blue Devils as the No. 3 seed in the Seattle 4 Region, taking on No. 14 seed Iona in Saturday night’s first round. It marks the program's first tournament appearance since 2018 and their first time hosting opening-weekend games since the year before that.“There’s no doubt I’m proud of the team and the strides we’ve made this year,” Lawson said Friday. “We finished 10th in our league last year, and this year we finished second. That’s hard to do in any league, let alone the ACC.”The Blue Devils (25-6) are one of 16 site hosts for the tournament, with sixth-seeded Colorado and 11th-seeded Middle Tennessee meet in the pod's first game Saturday.Lawson’s first season ended after four games when the Blue Devils shut down their season amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The Blue Devils didn’t make the field last year with a 17-13 record in their first full run under Lawson.“I was kind of upset that we didn’t get to be in it last year,” guard Celeste Taylor said. “But to come back and not only be in the tournament, to be a 3 seed, I think that’s a really great jump, a really great sign of progression in our program.""It's a bit of a throwback, too, to the days when Duke was racking up wins and earning a perennial spot in the NCAA field under Gail Goestenkors and much of Joanne P. McCallie's tenure. In fact, the Blue Devils reached the tournament in 23 of 24 years as of that last 2018 appearance.And in their 24 all-time appearances, they've won at least one game in each, including Final Four runs in 1999, 2002, 2003 and 2006.Duke is 13-1 at home this season, its lone loss in its last game in Cameron Indoor Stadium to end the regular season against North Carolina.“As a team where we were projected to finish at the beginning of the season versus where we are now has shown a lot of progress and just goes to show all the work we’ve put in this season,” said Duke center Kennedy Brown, a transfer from Oregon State.Iona (26-6) is 11-4 in road games, winning its last nine.“I hope that success carries,” Iona coach Billi Chambers said.The Gaels won the Mid-American Athletic Conference championship despite a 6-5 start to the season. Iona has lost just once since Christmas behind an offense that ranks eighth nationally in shooting percentage (.474) and second in 3-point percentage (.401).And the Gaels don’t intend to change their preparation, even playing in Duke's Cameron Indoor Stadium.“We approach every game the same way whether it be home or away,” guard Kate Mager said.EXPERIENCE THISThe tournament vibe should be rewarding for Colorado (23-8) and Middle Tennessee (28-4).Colorado is in the tournament in back-to-back seasons for the first time since a string from 2001-04. The Buffaloes lost in last year's first round to Creighton.“I would think four years ago a lot of people wouldn’t be able to say Colorado would be in this position,” Buffaloes guard Jaylyn Sherrod said. “So I’m just thankful for the opportunity.”The Buffaloes hope what they learned a year ago in a first-round loss to Creighton can help them this time.Middle Tennessee appeared in the 2021 tournament, but that was in the bubble in Texas due to pandemic restrictions.“We didn’t get the full experience last time,” Middle Tennessee guard Alexis Whittington said. “So this time coming in, I was, like, wow, it’s really my first time to experience everything.”Blue Raiders coach Rick Insell, who’s in his 11th NCAA tournament with the program, said he can already tell this should more reflect the experience than two years ago.“There’s not any comparison,” he said. “You would have thought you were in prison during COVID. You had someone guarding your room. You had somebody guarding the floor. You had somebody guarding the elevator.""I wanted them to come back and experience what it was really like, and I think they’ll get that right here.”COUNT THEM ALLMiddle Tennessee sold out its ticket allotment and expects more of its fans in the building. Insell is ready to see that number expand because of the location.“Duke, they’re ‘Blue,’ too, so we’ll claim all them,” he said.The Blue Raiders find it intriguing to play in famed Cameron Indoor Stadium.“I know it’s a historic place,” Whittington said. “I feel like it’s a big stage. That’s what we wanted.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839467,March Madness: Miami gets 21 from Pack to rally past Drake,"ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — With Miami's season on the line, the Hurricanes' leaders got together and insisted their NCAA Tournament wasn't going to end with an early loss to a double-digit seed.Nijel Pack, Wooga Poplar and Norchad Omier made sure the season continued for fifth-seeded Miami.Pack scored 21 points — including the go-ahead jumper and a pair of free throws in the final minute — to rally the Canes past Drake 63-56 in the first round on Friday night.“I was like, ‘Man, this can’t be the way how it ends,’” Pack said. “I talked to my teammates. I felt like they felt the same way. We kind of brought some inner energy from within us.”Miami also picked up its defensive intensity, got a couple of steals, put Drake on its heels and reeled off the final 10 points in an overall 16-1 closing spurt to get past the 12th-seeded Bulldogs (27-8).“It takes a lot to survive, and we fortunately survived today,” said Miami coach Jim Larrañaga, whose team advanced to the Elite Eight last year before losing to eventual national champion Kansas.Miami will face fourth-seeded Indiana on Sunday in the second round of the Midwest Region.Omier added 12 points and 14 rebounds for the Hurricanes, who were held to a season low in scoring. Poplar had 15 points.Darnell Brodie had 20 points and nine rebounds to lead the Missouri Valley Conference tournament champions. The Bulldogs missed their last seven shots from the field and were scoreless the final 3:24.“Certainly disappointed, disappointed for our group that we weren’t able to pull that out,” Drake coach Darian DeVries said. “I thought overall we played a really, really good 35, 37 minutes, and couldn’t quite finish it out.”Mo Valley Player of the Year Tucker DeVries, whose father is the coach, scored three points on 1-of-13 shooting.Brodie tied the game at 47-all with a free throw and then Calhoun hit two consecutive 3-pointers in an 8-0 run that Roman Penn capped with a jumper for a 55-47 lead with 5:40 to go.Pack started the rally with a jumper and Poplar hit two free throws and a jumper to close the deficit to 55-53 with 3:34 to play.After Penn scored the Bulldogs' final point on a free throw with 3:24 left, Miller hit two free throws and Bensley Joseph made one to tie the contest at 56 with 2:20 to play.Pack, who was 7 of 15 from the field, put Miami ahead for good with his jumper off a turnover.BIG PICTUREDrake: The Bulldogs were in great position until the final minutes. They see potential for the future.“Coach has built a great program here at Drake,” Penn said. “Us coming here, we just kind of wanted to lay the blueprint down for future Bulldogs hopefully and just hope to continue the tradition and keep on winning and playing hard.”Miami: The Hurricanes looked disconnected offensively all night and they will have to improve to get back to another Elite Eight. Miller and Isaiah Wong, the Canes' top scorers, combined for 12 points on 3-of-17 shooting. Miami was saved by making 23 of 29 from the free-throw line.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/18,,World

He appeared in only six games last season due to a hamstring injury and had 10 receptions for 130 yards and a touchdown.Parham's best season was in 2021, when he had 20 catches for 190 yards and three TDs.Scott led punters in average hang time last season and was part of a punt coverage unit that allowed a league-low 3.1 yards per punt return.Los Angeles has re-signed five of its free agents so far. Their only new addition has been linebacker Eric Kendricks.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/3/18,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839475,"Smith hits late 3-pointer, Rockets beat Pelicans 114-112","HOUSTON (AP) — Rookie Jabari Smith Jr. hit a 3-pointer with less than a second remaining to give the Houston Rockets a 114-112 victory over the New Orleans Pelicans on Friday night in the first of straight games between the teams.Smith hit the shot over defender Naji Marshall from slightly right of straightaway and immediately turned to his coach Stephen Silas, who was pointing at Smith in celebration.“It says a lot about our resilience, our execution, the guys we have in that locker room. A lot of guys played well on both ends of the floor,” Silas said. “Everybody had a part in it, but it says a couple things. We’re moving in the right direction, we’re feeling good about ourselves, and there’s been some improvement.”Smith had 11 points and eight rebounds in 29 minutes. It was his only 3-pointer in three attempts. Smith was rewarded the game ball, which he immediately delivered to his father.“I felt like I was in a video game,” Smith said. “It was crazy. It was like I didn’t see anybody else. The gym went blank, it was just me and him. It was a special moment, for sure.”Jalen Green led Houston with 25 points and had seven rebounds and six assists. Kevin Porter Jr. added 20 points and six assists.Brandon Ingram led New Orleans with 31 points. Jonas Valanciunas added 22 points and 17 rebounds, one shy of his season high. Valanciunas had his first 20-point game since Jan. 20, bullying the Rockets in the paint and going 10 for 16 from the field with four blocks on the defensive end.The teams will meet again Sunday night in Houston.“It was tough, with a crazy shot at the end,” Ingram said. “But we know that we can clean up some mistakes that we had before that shot happened. It started with me with a couple of turnovers at the end of the game that kind of shifted the momentum for Houston. I’ve got to be better at executing plays.”The Rockets entered the fourth quarter trailing 90-80. With Houston threatening late, Ingram blocked Green’s layup that would have cut the lead to one and made a layup in transition. It was a four-point swing that put New Orleans up five with 1:25 remaining.Green hit a 22-foot jumper with 35.1 seconds remaining to make it 112-111. Porter rebounded Ingram’s miss to give the Rockets the final possession with 4.0 seconds remaining.Houston went on a 22-0 run in the first half, turning a 26-12 deficit into a 34-26 lead. Across parts of the first and second quarters, New Orleans were trapped in a scoring drought of 6:10.New Orleans regained the lead later in the second quarter after Herbert Jones intercepted a bad pass by Alperen Sengun and made a layup. Sengun finished with 17 points.At 18-52, Houston has its first three-game winning streak since December 2021.TIP-INSPelicans: Zion Williamson (hamstring) and Jose Alvarado (tibial stress reaction) sat on the New Orleans bench in plainclothes. … Veteran centers Jaxson Hayes and Willy Hernangomez did not play.Rockets: Porter received a technical foul midway through the third quarter, seemingly for arguing over a foul call. … Jae’Sean Tate had 12 points, six rebounds and five assists in 21 minutes.BOBAN’S SHINING MOMENTFan favorite Boban Marjanovic, the 7-foot-4 veteran center from Serbia featured in television commercials, played less than two minutes Friday night, but he made a clutch contribution to the win. He was guarding the inbound pass on the final play of the game and tipped the alley-oop pass with 0.4 seconds, and time expired before the ball made it near the rim.“Today, he gets a finger on it and the game was over as soon as he touches it,” Silas said. “I was really happy for him because he works really hard and everyone loves him. That was a huge play.”UP NEXTPelicans: Remain in Houston for a game on Sunday night.Rockets: Host New Orleans again on Sunday night.___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/18,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839477,"Urías leads Mexico 5-4 over Puerto Rico, into WBC semis","MIAMI (AP) — Luis Urías hit the go-ahead single in a three-run seventh inning that fueled Mexico’s 5-4 comeback victory over Puerto Rico to advance to its first-ever World Baseball Classic semifinals.Mexico will face Shohei Ohtani and Japan in the semifinals Monday. Puerto Rico failed to make it past the second round for the first time.“What a game. I don’t have a cap with me but if I did, I’d tip it to Puerto Rico,"" Mexico manager Benji Gil said. ""We fought until the end. Thank God, we managed to come out with a victory against a great team.”Isaac Paredes, who homered earlier, tied it at 4 with a single off losing pitcher Alexis Díaz that drove in Austin Barnes and Tampa Bay Rays outfielder Randy Arozarena.Puerto Rico tried to rally in the ninth with singles from Christian Vazquez and Francisco Lindor, but reliever Giovanny Gallegos got out of the jam for the save.Arozarena saved the potential tying run in the eighth when he made a leaping catch at the wall in left center.“We know what kind of player Randy is. He’s a great player. He killed us,” Puerto Rico manager Yadier Molina said. “We couldn’t score. But they played very well. We started very strong, but then the Mexican pitching made some adjustments and kept us in zeros.”Puerto Rico was coming off an emotional quarterfinals-clinching victory over the Dominican Republic on Wednesday, when New York Mets star closer Edwin Díaz tore the patellar tendon in his right knee while celebrating the win. The sellout crowd of 35,817 at loanDepot park in Miami cheered when Diaz’s jersey appeared on the Jumbotron.Javier Baez and Eddie Rosario homered off Mexico starter Julio Urías in a four-run first inning.Rosario hit his second home run of the tournament. Baez, in one of his best games of the event, had three hits, giving him seven total.“We had a very difficult start to the game but we know the kind of team we have and how united we are,"" Paredes said. ""There were many innings remaining and we responded at the zero hour.”Urías allowed five hits and four runs and struck out four before he was lifted after the fourth inning at 60 pitches, which is 20 fewer than the WBC quarterfinals pitch limit of 80.JoJo Romero got the win.Paredes made it 4-1 in the second when he homered against Marcus Stroman, which was one of Mexico’s five hits off Puerto Rico’s starter.Stroman allowed three singles in the fifth, one of which drove in a run for Mexico to make it 4-2. He had two strikeouts in 4 1-3 innings.Puerto Rico finished second in the past two WBCs. Earlier in this tournament, its pitchers turned in an all-time performance against Israel in pool play with an eight-inning perfect game.Mexico won group C with a 3-1 record in pool play.___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839478,"Grizzlies rally from 29 down, stun Spurs 126-120 in OT","SAN ANTONIO (AP) — Jaren Jackson Jr. scored 28 points and the Memphis Grizzlies completed the largest comeback in franchise history after trailing by 29 in the third quarter, rallying to beat the San Antonio Spurs 126-120 in overtime Friday night.Memphis faced a nine-point deficit in the final minute of regulation before outscoring San Antonio 9-0 to send it to overtime.“We came in at halftime, regrouped, talked about it,” Jackson said. “Just came out firing (in the second half). You chip away long enough, you’re going to make some noise.”Desmond Bane added 21 points, including eight points in overtime, and Tyus Jones had his first career triple-double with 20 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists for the Grizzlies.The huge comeback win came as Ja Morant nears his return for Memphis. The All-Star guard missed his seventh game as part of an eight-game suspension for “conduct detrimental to the league.” Memphis improved to 4-3 without Morant.Devin Vassell had 25 points and Zach Collins added 24 for San Antonio, which fell to 0-5 in overtime this season after being outscored 63-40 in the second half.“We have been competitive all year,” Collins said. “We shouldn’t have lost that game. We were up 30, we shouldn’t have lost.”After trailing by 29, Memphis tied it at 109 on a 3-pointer by Dillon Brooks with 1.8 seconds remaining in regulation. Vassell’s desperation 36-foot heave did not reach the rim as regulation ended.Brooks finished with 16 points, while going 4 for 8 on 3-pointers.“Our defense really clamped down down the stretch where we were trying to keep them off the boards,"" Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said. ""Couple of tough bounces, but we came up with enough plays down the stretch.”San Antonio was without key reserves Doug McDermott (bruised right hip), Devonte’ Graham (sore left quadriceps) and Romeo Langford (managing injured left adductor) and lost Jeremy Sochan after eight minutes. Memphis was without Steven Adams and Brandon Clark.“We got a little thin,” Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. “And down the stretch, they made shots, they made three 3s in a row, give them credit for that. Great game, though. Learned a lot to compete as hard as we did. Proud of them. Did a good job.”The Grizzlies called two timeouts within 37 seconds midway through the first quarter following a 3-pointer by Collins and another by Vassell.“Really started at halftime,” Jenkins said. “We didn’t watch any film. I just opened up the floor to the players to talk and said, ‘What do you got for me?’ Four or five guys spoke up and said it was unacceptable what we were doing in the first half.""We were too casual, we weren’t communicating, we weren’t executing our coverages, we weren’t playing with physicality, we weren’t trusting the pass.”The Spurs shot 12 for 24 on 3-pointers in the first half in building a 25-point lead.San Antonio shot 31% from the field in the second half, including 6 for 20 on 3-pointers, while committing 14 turnovers.Brooks and Jackson combined for 26 points in the second half.TIP-INS Grizzlies: Memphis has won 10 straight against San Antonio with its last loss to the Spurs on Dec. 23, 2020, 131-119.Spurs: Sochan fouled Jackson with 2:01 remaining in the first quarter and motioned to the bench for a substitute. Sochan left for the locker room and returned with 7:32 remaining to tell Popovich about his injury. ... San Antonio has led by 25 points in three games this season.SPECIAL MOMENTSan Antonio honored Jaren Jackson Sr. after the first quarter as part of its season-long 50th Anniversary celebration.“I wanted to allow myself to play in this game (and) play well,” Jackson Jr. said. “I knew he was here. Probably was the tiniest bit nervous if I was ever for a regular-season game just because you want to remember this day.""Spurs fans gave a loud and long ovation following a video highlighting Jackson’s four seasons with San Antonio, which included winning an NBA title in 1999. Jackson Jr. shared a long embrace with his father near midcourt during the ovation.Jackson had his father’s No. 2 jersey from the Spurs in his bag following the game, which he intends to keep.“Do I have any? (No,) he has them,” Jackson Jr. said. “This is mine. I’m going to go out there and get it signed by him.”UP NEXTGrizzlies: Host Golden State on Saturday.Spurs: Host Atlanta on Sunday. —More AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/18,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839491,EU's Kosovo-Serbia peace plan faces backlash in Belgrade,"Several thousand people gathered in Belgrade on Friday evening to rally against Kosovo-Serbia talks on an 11-point agreement proposed by the European Union.The plan aims to improve the severed ties between Serbia and Kosovo, formerly a part of Kosovo that declared independence in 2008.The demonstrations come ahead of a meeting to be held between Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic and Kosovar Prime Minister Albin Kurti on Saturday in North Macedonia.EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell is to chair the meeting that aims for the two Balkan countries to mend existing ties to achieve their goals of joining the EU.The protesters gathered to criticize Vucic's policy and urged him ""to reject everything"" in the upcoming meeting.Banners reading ""No to capitulation,"" and ""Kosovo is not for sale"" were also carried by the demonstrators.""It [the deal] is definitely a recognition [of Kosovo], whether you say it explicitly or whether it is implied indirectly, it is still recognition and it is not acceptable,"" said Milos Jovanovic, one of the protest organizers and head of the Democratic Party of Serbia.Tensions have existed among groups in the region for decades after the war in 1998-99 between Serbian forces and ethnic Albanian insurgents. The war ended when NATO bombed Serbia in 1999 over the expulsion of Albanians in Kosovo.Since 2008 when Kosovo declared independence from Serbia, Belgrade, with the backing of China and Russia, has not recognized Kosovo's sovereignty.However, many, though not all, Western countries have recognized Kosovo as an independent state, with its ethnic Albanian majority population of 1.8 million.With Russia currently waging a war in Ukraine, improving bilateral relations between Serbia and Kosovo has become essential for maintaining peace in the Balkan region.Last month, Belgrade and Pristina failed to come to terms in Brussels when the EU bloc revealed the peace plan.According to the agreement, Serbia does not have to identify Kosovo as an independent nation but will have to recognize official documents such as passports, license plates, and diplomas.Borrell has urged Kurti and Vucic to normalize ties between the two countries. He wrote in a blog piece that he sees the move as ""an important step"" towards their goal of joining the EU in the future.aa/sms  (AFP, Reuters, AP)",2023/3/18,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839492,UN trying to resolve argument over Black Sea grain deal,"The United Nations is ""doing everything possible"" to ensure the Black Sea grain deal continues, aid chief Martin Griffiths told the UN Security Council on Friday.Russia and Ukraine disagree about the duration of an extension of the pact, which allows for the safe transportation of grain and foodstuffs from Ukrainian ports through the Black Sea despite the ongoing war.The initial 120-day agreement struck with the UN and Turkey was extended in November for a further 120 days, until March 18.But Russia now says it would only allow a further 60-day extension, while Ukraine insists on a 120-day extension.""Attempts by the aggressor to reduce the extension period are a manipulation to continue further blackmail and deepen a global food crisis. We have to prevent this,"" Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said.According to the UN, Ukraine has exported nearly 25 million tons of food under the deal which has helped that has helped bring down global food prices.""The world relies on these supplies,"" Griffiths said.Moscow says a parallel agreement has failed to facilitate Russian exports of grain and fertilizer through the Black Sea.The West has imposed tough sanctions on Russia for its full-scale invasion and war in Ukraine. While its food and fertilizer exports are not under sanctions, Moscow says restrictions on payments, logistics and insurance industries are a barrier to shipments.""If Brussels, Washington and London are genuinely interested to continue the export of food from Ukraine through the maritime humanitarian corridor then they have two months to exempt from their sanctions the entire chain of operations which accompany the Russian agricultural sector,"" Russia's UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told the Security Council.Griffiths admitted obstacles remain to help facilitate Russian food and fertilizer exports, notably the payment systems.""It is vital for global food security that both of these agreements continue and should be fully implemented,"" he said.US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield told the Council, ""sanctions are not the issue.""""When it comes to sanctions we have gone to extraordinary lengths to communicate the clear carve-outs for food and fertilizers to governments and to the private sector,"" she said.lo/sms (Reuters, AFP)",2023/3/18,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839510,"Purdue, Painter lament another early March Madness exit","COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — It's become a disturbing, familiar pattern for Purdue.Another promising season. Another putrid NCAA Tournament.For the third straight year, the Boilermakers were bounced by a double-digit seed, losing Friday night to No. 16 seed Fairleigh Dickinson, which doesn't have a player taller than 6-foot-6 but took out the Big Ten's best squad with surprising ease.“Obviously it hurts,” Purdue coach Matt Painter said. “It hurts bad. I don’t want to take anything away from them. They earned it. They played better than we did.”Purdue was looking to make history. Not this type.The Boilermakers are the second No. 1 seed to lose to a No. 16 seed, joining Virginia, which fell to UMBC in 2018.This March was supposed to be different. The Boilermakers (29-6), who haven't made the Final Four since 1980 and have never won a title, had one of the nation's best players in All-America center Zach Edey, shooters to support him, experience and depth.But Purdue, which was a top seed for the first time since 1996, buckled under FDU's full-court pressure and the Boilermakers couldn't figure out how to get the ball inside to the 7-foot-4 Edey, who spent the night sandwiched between several Knights defenders.Last year, it was No. 15 seed Saint Peter's that ousted the Boilermakers, and No. 13 seed North Texas the year before that.“It stinks,"" said Painter, who has lost to double-digit seeds five times. ""They outplayed us. They outcoached us. That's the one thing as a coach that you always face it, and you’ll get ridiculed. You’ll get shamed. You’ll get whatever.""“It’s basketball. You’ve got to get better. You’ve got to keep fighting to get yourself in this position and then be better. And that’s what we have to do.”Back to the drawing board.Edey's night started ominously when he short-armed a jumper in the lane that fell short of the rim. He rarely got a clean touch, and while he finished with 21 points and 15 rebounds, the Canadian nicknamed “Big Maple” by his mom couldn't lift his team to victory.After the final horn, Edey walked glumly toward Purdue's locker room and an unknown future.There's a chance he won't be back as he would likely be an early pick in this year's NBA draft. It's also possible he'll return after another stinging loss that has left Purdue's fans wondering if it will ever be their year. (If history is any solace, Virginia won the national title the year after it was embarrassed by UMBC.)“I have no opinion on that,” Edey said when pressed about his next move. “I’ll make my decision going forward.”Painter is regarded as one of the country's best coaches. But although he graduates his players and has kept the Boilermakers among the elite for years, questions remain about whether he can get his team over the top.He'll have another year to consider what went wrong and what might have been.“You win the league, you win your tournament,” he said. “You fight to get into this position. We haven’t been in this position as a 1 seed in a long time. And we get here and we don’t take advantage of that opportunity.”It's a Purdue tradition in March.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839511,DeRozan scores 49 as Bulls beat Timberwolves in double OT,"CHICAGO (AP) — DeMar DeRozan scored a season-high 49 points, Zach LaVine finished with 39 and the Chicago Bulls beat the Minnesota Timberwolves 139-131 in double overtime on Friday night.DeRozan and LaVine joined Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen as the only Bulls duo with 39 points or more in the same game, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. The two Hall of Famers did it against the Indiana Pacers on Feb. 18, 1996, with Jordan going for 44 and Pippen finishing with 40.“When we've got it rolling like that, it makes everything so much easier not even just to score, just to get everybody else involved,” said DeRozan, who had some trouble seeing after getting hit in the eye.Nikola Vucevic added 21 points and 11 rebounds.Minnesota All-Star Anthony Edwards left with a sprained right ankle in the first quarter, and the Timberwolves lost for the fourth time in five games.Mike Conley led Minnesota with 28 points, nailing a career-high 8 of 12 3-pointers. Rudy Gobert finished with 21 points and 19 rebounds before fouling out in the first OT, and Jaden McDaniels scored 25 points.The Bulls led 130-125 in the second OT before Conley hit a 3-pointer. Minnesota’s Naz Reid had a layup rim out, and DeRozan made a turnaround jumper to bump Chicago’s lead to 132-28 with 1:27 remaining.Nickeil Alexander-Walker made the second free throw after an airball to pull the Timberwolves within three, but Vucevic brought the Bulls bench to its feet with a thunderous one-handed dunk for a three-point play with just over a minute left.Reid drove for a layup to make it a four-point game. But DeRozan made four free throws in the final 36 seconds to help Chicago come away with a wild win.EDWARDS INJUREDEdwards was hurt late in the first quarter when he landed awkwardly after jumping while throwing a pass. He stayed down clutching his ankle before being helped to the back, and coach Chris Finch wasn't sure how long he'll be out, though Edwards wasn't ruling out playing at Toronto on Saturday.“I’m gonna see how it feels tomorrow,” he said. ""Hopefully I can play.”Losing Edwards, who came into the game averaging 25 points and made his first All-Star team this year, would be a big blow for the Timberwolves, particularly with Karl-Anthony Towns appears poised to return from a calf injury that has sidelined him for most of the season. The Timberwolves are trying to avoid the play-in and build some momentum with the regular season winding down.“You want to be getting guys healthy and playing at your best, guys in a great rhythm,"" Conley said. ""Obviously being without KAT and then losing Ant, two of our best players, at such an important time of the season is very tough. This team's got to be resilient. This is gonna be a great time for us to grow up together and figure it out.”FIRST OTConley nailed a 3 to give Minnesota a 121-118 lead in the first overtime. DeRozan tied on a three-point play with just over a minute left, with Gobert fouling out in the process.McDaniels then scored to put Minnesota back on top. LaVine drove for a tying layup with 11 seconds remaining after the Timberwolves’ Taurean Prince threw the ball away, and McDaniels missed a pull-up 3 for Minnesota.TIP-INSTimberwolves: Finch said there are “a lot of dynamics” to Towns' impending return that the Timberwolves “haven't really dug into” because there are still some unknowns, such as whether he will be on a minutes restriction. Towns hasn't played since he strained his right calf against Nov. 28 in a game at Washington. The team announced Wednesday the three-time All-Star is expected to return “in the coming weeks.” “The good thing about KAT is he's pretty much wired to make the right play, whether it's passing or shooting,"" Finch said.Bulls: Coach Billy Donovan wasn’t sure when or even if Lonzo Ball will play again for Chicago, with the point guard set to have yet another surgery on his troublesome left knee. Donovan said Ball will likely undergo a cartilage transplant early next week, though he wasn’t sure which day, and is in for “a long rehab.” The surgery will be the third on the knee in 14 months for Ball, who was ruled out for the season in February.UP NEXTTimberwolves: Visit Toronto on Saturday.Bulls: Host Miami on Saturday.___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/18,,World

Undersized FDU played big against the Boilermakers and became only the second No. 16 seed to topple a No. 1 seed. Maryland-Baltimore County was the first, knocking off Virginia in 2018.FDU's win blew up most of the remaining brackets. Just who are these guys?WHERE IS FDU?The school has two campuses in New Jersey: Teaneck and Florham. The school's website list a total enrollment of 11,400 students, though U.S. News & World Report lists the number as 7,860 as of fall 2021. The Teaneck campus is close to New York City; the Florham campus is on a former country estate of socialites Florence Vanderbilt and Hamilton Twombly. FDU has owned the campus since 1958. FDU also has campuses in Wroxton, England, and Vancouver, British Columbia.WHAT’S FDU KNOWN FOR?Founded in 1942, notable alumni include billionaire and NFL Minnesota Vikings owner Zygi Wilf; Peggy Noonan, journalist and speechwriter to former President Ronald Reagan; former college basketball coach and ESPN analyst Seth Greenberg; and U.S. Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester, a Delaware Democrat.WHO ARE THE FDU STARS?Demetre Robinson (16.6 points per game), Grant Singleton (14.3), Ansley Almonor (14.1) and Joe Munden Jr. (10.6). Sean Moore, the Knights' leading scorer in the Purdue game with 19 points, came in averaging 6.7.HOW DID THE KNIGHTS GET HERE?FSU lost in the Northeast Conference Tournament final to Merrimack by a single point but got the automatic bid to the NCAA tourney because Merrimack wasn't eligible as it transitions to Division I. FDU routed Texas Southern in the First Four play-in round to earn a date against Purdue.DID YOU KNOW?The FDU win is just the latest in eye-catching victories by New Jersey schools.A year ago, Saint Peter’s toppled No. 2 seed Kentucky in overtime to bust a bunch of brackets and then became the first 15-seed to reach the Elite Eight by beating ...

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839514,7-day quarantine requirement for migrant workers scrapped,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Incoming migrant workers will no longer be required to undergo a seven-day quarantine in individual rooms after entering Taiwan.The Ministry of Labor (MOL) said on Friday (March 17) the requirement that new or returning migrant workers quarantine upon arrival will no longer apply from March 20.Paul Su (蘇裕國), the head of migrant worker cross-border management for MOL said that in addition to removing the isolation requirements, incoming migrant workers will no longer be required to vaccinate, per CNA. However, an MOL statement reminded employers to encourage workers to get vaccinated.The labor ministry said the suspension of isolation requirements for migrant workers is in line with a general relaxation of pandemic control policies, but reminded migrant workers to abide by epidemic prevention requirements when taking public transport and entering medical facilities.Migrant workers entering Taiwan before March 20 still need to isolate, but their employers can apply for a MOL subsidy of 50% of the accommodation costs.Wu Jing-ru (吳靜如), a researcher from the Taiwan International Workers Association (TIWA) told Taiwan News that while the change is positive, migrant workers still had to endure four additional months of entry restrictions that other groups did not. She said this shows the government will only listen to blue-collar migrant workers if they protest.“Whether this means government agencies and employers will stop using the pandemic as an excuse to trouble migrant workers, we'll just have to wait and see,” Wu said. “The government has taken the lead in this kind of discrimination for a long time, and that's why Taiwanese society is still very unfriendly to blue-collar migrant workers, no matter how many international conventions have been signed.”In February, migrant laborers and advocacy groups protested the restrictions saying they were discriminatory, citing the need for Alien Residence Certificate (ARC) holding migrant workers to apply for a re-entry permit. Other ARC holders did not have to do so.They also protested the high cost of the required isolation accommodation. During the protests, one migrant worker said the cost of isolation and the plane ticket to Taiwan amounted to two months of his basic salary (about NT$25,000 or US$820 per month).",2023/3/18,1078,Society

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839517,Wyoming governor signs measure prohibiting abortion pills,"Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon has signed into law the nation's first explicit ban on abortion pills since they became the predominant choice for abortion in the U.S. in recent years.Gordon, a Republican, signed the bill Friday night while allowing a separate measure restricting abortion to become law without his signature.The pills are already banned in 13 states that have blanket bans on all forms of abortion, and 15 states already have limited access to abortion pills. Until now, however, no state had passed a law specifically prohibiting such pills, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights.A group seeking to open an abortion and women's health clinic in Casper said it was evaluating legal options.“We are dismayed and outraged that these laws would eradicate access to basic health care, including safe, effective medication abortion,” Wellspring Health Access President Julie Burkhart said in a statement Saturday.The clinic, which a firebombing prevented from opening last year, is one of two nonprofits suing to block an earlier Wyoming abortion ban. No arrests have been made, and organizers say the clinic is tentatively scheduled to open in April, depending on abortion's legal status in Wyoming then.The Republican governor’s decision on the two measures comes after the issue of access to abortion pills took center stage this week in a Texas court. A federal judge there raised questions about a Christian group’s effort to overturn the decades-old U.S. approval of a leading abortion drug, mifepristone.Medication abortions became the preferred method for ending pregnancy in the U.S. even before the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the ruling that protected the right to abortion for nearly five decades. A two-pill combination of mifepristone and another drug is the most common form of abortion in the U.S.Wyoming’s ban on abortion pills would take effect in July, pending any legal action that could potentially delay that. The implementation date of the sweeping legislation banning all abortions that Gordon allowed to go into law is not specified in the bill.With the earlier ban tied up in court, abortion currently remains legal in the state up to viability, or when the fetus could survive outside the womb.In a statement, Gordon expressed concern that the latter law, dubbed the Life is a Human Right Act would result in a lawsuit that will “delay any resolution to the constitutionality of the abortion ban in Wyoming.”He noted that earlier in the day, plaintiffs in an ongoing lawsuit filed a challenge to the new law in the event he did not issue a veto.“I believe this question needs to be decided as soon as possible so that the issue of abortion in Wyoming can be finally resolved, and that is best done with a vote of the people,” Gordon said in a statement.In a statement, Wyoming ACLU advocacy director Antonio Serrano criticized Gordon’s decision to sign the ban on abortion pills.“A person’s health, not politics, should guide important medical decisions — including the decision to have an abortion,” Serrano said.Of the 15 states that have limited access to the pills, six require an in-person physician visit. Those laws could withstand court challenges; states have long had authority over how physicians, pharmacists and other providers practice medicine.States also set the rules for telemedicine consultations used to prescribe medications. Generally, that means health providers in states with restrictions on abortion pills could face penalties, such as fines or license suspension, for trying to send pills through the mail.Women have already been traveling across state lines to places where abortion pill access is easier. That trend is expected to increase.Since the reversal of Roe in June, abortion restrictions have been up to states, and the landscape has shifted quickly. Thirteen states now enforce bans on abortion at any point in pregnancy, and another, Georgia, bans it once cardiac activity can be detected, or at about six weeks’ gestation.Courts have put on hold enforcement of abortion bans or deep restrictions in Arizona, Indiana, Montana, Ohio, South Carolina, Utah and Wyoming. Idaho courts have forced the state to allow abortions during medical emergencies.",2023/3/19,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839542,Mexican migrant killed in California capsize left daughter,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — Yecenia Lazcano Soriano left behind a 4-year-old daughter in her home town of Tehuacan, Mexico, when she set out almost in secret to reach the United States.The last message she sent to relatives was a heart emoji. Days later, on the California coast, two small boats carrying her and other migrants capsized in rough surf off a beach in San Diego.The 22-year-old’s body was one of eight recovered shortly after the accident last Sunday at Black’s Beach, one of the deadliest maritime smuggling events near U.S. shores.A single mother, Lazcano Soriano’s story was almost a microcosm of the desperation that drives many migrants to the United States. Nearly 129,000 migrants were stopped trying to cross the U.S. border in February.At age 15, Lazcano Soriano went to live with the father of her child, but he was abducted and disappeared, like over 112,000 other Mexicans who have vanished since drug cartel violence picked up in 2006.Lazcano Soriano dreamed of opening her own store in Tehuacan, a poor agricultural town lying between the cities of Puebla and Oaxaca in south-central Mexico. Most there make a tenuous living growing flowers or corn. The single mother sold fruit and vegetables at a local market.But with jobs scarce, she decided to follow her aunt, Wendy Valencia, who left Tehuacan to emigrate to Dallas six years ago.Lazcano Soriano left Tehuacan weeks ago, telling only two of her relatives. The last message she sent was a heart emoji to Valencia. After that, there was silence, until the chilling news came: Authorities had identified her by ID documents found on her body.“She wasn’t afraid of work,” Valencia said in a telephone interview. “She was a warrior, a woman who was accustomed to struggle.”She left her daughter in the care of her 72-year-old grandmother and two other aunts, but had hoped to be reunited with the girl.“Her goal was to give her daughter a better future, an adequate home,” Valencia said. Life was never that kind to Lazcano Soriano; her companion’s disappearance was never solved.A total of 23 people were thought to aboard the two boats that capsized off San Diego. Many of the other passengers are believed to have made it to land and escaped.Mexican authorities said preliminary identification based on records found with people’s bodies indicate seven of the eight dead were Mexicans.Just 25 miles (40 kilometers) from Tehuacan, in the town of Tlacotepec de Benito Juarez, the tragedy touched the family of Alma Figueroa Gorgoria.Figueroa Gorgoria would have turned 18 next week. She had set out for the United States with her aunt, Ana Jacqueline Figueroa, 23. Both of their bodies were identified in San Diego.Just seven miles (12 kilometers) in the other direction, the nearby farming community of Santiago Miahuatlan was the hometown of Guillermo Suárez González, who also risked traveling in the boats to reach the United States. A worker at a local export assembly plant, the 23-year-old dreamed of a better life; he left behind four children. Eloy Hernández Baltazar, 58, also lived in Santiago Miahuatlan, and was also among the dead.The Puebla state migrant aid office said the paperwork has been submitted to return Suárez González to his home town for burial.",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839543,"Collins, Mississippi reach NCAA second round, beat Gonzaga","STANFORD, Calif. (AP) — Snudda Collins knew exactly how many shots she had missed, having carefully kept track of her stat lines through the Southeastern Conference Tournament: 0 for 22.“I was in a slump,” she said.""I did not know that, every time Snudda shoots I think it's going in,"" teammate Angel Baker said.Collins found her groove again and scored 15 points, and eighth-seeded Mississippi once again leaned on its stingy defense to get past the first round of the NCAA Tournament this time after last year's big disappointment, beating No. 9 seed Gonzaga 71-48 on Friday night.The Rebels shut down one of the best 3-point-shooting teams in the country.“Coming into this game I think I was 0 for 22 and I knew that, and I kind of took it personal,” Collins said.Now, bring on top-seeded Stanford on its home court.Ole Miss will face the Cardinal (29-5) on Sunday for a spot at the Sweet Sixteen in Seattle next weekend. Stanford topped No. 16 seed Sacred Heart 92-49 in Friday's first game at Maples Pavilion.Already tested twice by No. 1 South Carolina, coach Yolett McPhee-McCuin’s Rebels showed off their signature defense that has held opponents to just 56.8 points per game by shutting down one of the nation's top 3-point-shooting teams. The Zags (28-5) scored a season-low points — and their only loss with fewer points was a 64-60 defeat to Portland in the West Coast Conference Tournament title game March 7.This Ole Miss group is determined to take another step toward erasing the memory of last season's 75-61 first-round loss to 10th-seeded South Dakota playing as a No. 7 seed and back in the tournament for the first time in 15 years.Madison Scott had 11 points and 10 rebounds and Angel Baker added 11 points and five boards for Ole Miss, which grabbed 24 offensive rebounds.The Rebels earned back-to-back 20-win seasons for the first time under McPhee-McCuin and it hadn’t been done since the 1993-94 and 1994-95 seasons. Making consecutive NCAA appearances for the first time since 2004-05, the Rebels held WCC Player of the Year Kaylynne Truong to six points on 2-of-9 shooting.“As far as our defensive performance, elite. We wanted to hold them to 12 or less each quarter and we did that,” McPhee-McCuin said. ""I was just in awe watching our team defend. That is who we are. We wear shirts in practice that say ‘We Defend.’”Yvonne Ejim led the Zags with 19 points and eight rebounds but her star teammates were stymied. Gonzaga came in shooting 42% from 3-point range and Brynna Maxwell held the second-best 3-point shooting percentage in the nation coming in at 49.43%, but the team finished just 1 for 17 and Maxwell scored four points on 1-of-10 shooting missing all five of her 3s.“Kudos to them, they guard the 3-point well,” Truong said. “Coming into the game we knew that.”The Zags missed six straight shots spanning halftime and made a forgettable showing in their sixth straight NCAA Tournament.“What a bummer,” coach Lisa Fortier said. “We think that we’re a good enough to compete with that team, I know that we are. My team is tough but we’re only good enough to compete today if it’s under our terms. The game was definitely played under Ole Miss’ terms.”Ole Miss used a 9-0 run late in the first half to build a 26-16 lead as the Zags missed four straight shots. Collins' three-point play 1:13 before halftime helped put the Rebels ahead 34-21 at the break.A physical, defensive game, both teams took a while to find any offensive rhythm and began 7 for 22. They combined to miss the first 10 3-pointers before Baker connected at the 5:52 mark of the second quarter for Ole Miss.The Rebels didn't want to let Gonzaga get 50 points.“Poetic, that's all I can say, it was poetic,” McPhee-McCuin said of her team winning with defense.BIG PICTUREGonzaga: Ejim picked up her third foul with 3:52 left in the second quarter. ... Gonzaga's three seniors — Truong, twin sister Kayleigh and Maxwell — and redshirt junior Eliza Hollingsworth all announced after the final regular-season game they plan to return for one more season.Ole Miss: The Rebels improved to 21-0 when holding teams to 60 or fewer points. ... The Ole Miss bench outscored the Gonzaga reserves 33-6 and crashed the boards to hold a 51-36 overall rebounding advantage.UP NEXTOle Miss and Stanford have met just once previously, and that matchup also came on the big March stage.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839544,Election conspiracy movement grinds on as 2024 approaches,"FRANKLIN, Tenn. (AP) — One by one, the presenters inside the crowded hotel ballroom shared their computer screens and promised to show how easy it is to hack into voting systems across the U.S.Drawing gasps from the crowd, they highlighted theoretical vulnerabilities and problems from past elections. But instead of tailoring their efforts to improve election security, they argued that all voting machines should be eliminated — a message that was wrapped in conspiracies about elections being rigged to favor certain candidates.“We are at war. The only thing that's not flying right now is bullets,” said Mark Finchem, a Republican candidate for secretary of state in Arizona last year who continues to contest his loss and was the final speaker of the daylong conference.Finchem was among a group of Republican candidates running for governor, secretary of state or state attorney who disputed the outcome of the 2020 election and who lost in a clean sweep last November in important political battleground states, including Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.Yet deep distrust about U.S. elections persists among Republicans, skepticism fueled by former President Donald Trump’s false claims and by allies who have been traveling the country meeting with community groups and holding forums like the one recently just outside Nashville, attended by some 250 people.As the nation barrels toward the next presidential election, the election conspiracy movement that mushroomed after the last one shows no signs of slowing down. Millions have been convinced that any election in which their preferred candidate loses has been somehow rigged against them, a belief that has fed efforts among conservatives to ditch voting machines and to halt or delay certification of election results.“Voters who know the truth about our elections have faith in them,” said Liz Iacobucci, election security program manager with the voter advocacy group Common Cause. “But the people who have been led into disbelief — those people can be led into other things, like Jan. 6.”Trump, running for the White House for the third time, has signaled that the 2020 election will remain an integral part of his 2024 presidential bid. In a recent call with reporters about a new book, Trump pointed to polls that show a sizable number of people believe the 2020 election was stolen, even though there is no such evidence.“I’m an election denier,” Trump said. “You’ve got a lot of election deniers in this country and they’re not happy about what’s happened.”There has been no evidence of widespread fraud or manipulation of voting machines in the U.S., and multiple reviews in the battleground states where Trump disputed his loss confirmed the election results were accurate. State and local election officials have spent more than two years explaining the many layers of protection that surround voting systems, and last year’s midterm election was largely uneventful.Trump allies such as MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell and former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn remain prominent voices calling for a ban on voting machines. They want hand-marked paper ballots counted individually without the aid of machines by poll workers in the nearly 180,000 voting precincts across the country.“We all have the same agenda, to get our elections fair and transparent and where they can’t be hacked,” said Lindell, who recently announced plans to form what he calls an “election crime bureau” to bring his myriad legal, cybersecurity and legislative efforts under one organization.In an interview, Lindell said he has spent $40 million since the 2020 election investigating fraud claims and supporting efforts to ban voting machines. He said he is taking out loans to continue to fund the work.During an “America First Forum” held last month in South Carolina, Flynn told those gathered at a Charleston hotel that they were fighting not only Democrats but fellow Republicans who are dismissive of their concerns about the 2020 election.“Our Republican Party, they want to move on,” Flynn said via video conference. “And frankly, the American people are not going to move on.”An investigation by the AP and the PBS series “Frontline” last year examined how Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general, was traveling the country spreading conspiracy theories about the 2020 election and vaccines as he builds a movement based on Christian nationalist ideas. He relies in part on groups such as The America Project and America’s Future.The America Project was launched in 2021 by Patrick Byrne, founder of Overstock.com. Byrne said elections remain a top priority for the group, though it also will focus on border issues. Asked how much he's planning to spend ahead of the 2024 election, Byrne told the AP, “There is no budget.”“I have no children, no wife,” he said. “There’s no point in me saving it for anything.”Recently filed tax forms do not detail where the group's $7.7 million in revenue came from that year, but Byrne and Michael Flynn's brother, Joseph Flynn, told the AP that most of it came from Byrne himself. The group reported giving $2.75 million to Cyber Ninjas for a partisan and much-criticized review of the 2020 election in Maricopa County, Arizona, which includes Phoenix.Michael Flynn is now focused on the nonprofit group he leads, America’s Future, and other projects, according to his brother. That group reported raising $2.3 million in 2021 and paying out $1.2 million in grants, including just under $1 million to Cyber Ninjas.Others who have been central in the effort to raise doubts about the accuracy of elections also have been active this year. Among them is Douglas Frank, an Ohio math and science educator, who said on his social media account that he met with various groups in six states in January, seven states in February and planned to be in eight states in March.At the Tennessee forum, Kathy Harms, one of the event organizers, took the stage to talk about why she is fighting to get rid of voting machines.“I don’t do this for me. I would rather just be a grandmother at home,” said Harms, who lives in the county where the conference was held. “I have granddaughters I do this for because I want them to have what I have. I don’t want a banana republic.”Presentations by people who work in information technology claimed election officials have little security knowledge or experience.One of them, Mark Cook, walked attendees through the voting process, pointing out potential threats and playing a video he said was of an “Iranian whistleblower” accessing U.S. voter registration data to fraudulently request and submit military ballots.Cook said the video had some “real components to it” and “could be legitimate.” He did not mention that an influx of duplicate military ballots would be readily apparent because election workers log each person who casts a ballot, meaning a second ballot that appears to be cast by the same person would be caught.“There are thousands of ways to exploit these systems,” Cook said, dismissing security steps taken by election officials as a “shell game” and “smoke and mirrors to distract us.”Election officials acknowledge that vulnerabilities exist, but say multiple defenses are in place to thwart attempted manipulation or detect malicious activity.“Election officials and their partners understand that the goal isn’t to create a perfect election system, but one that ensures that any attack on the election system doesn’t exceed the ability to detect and recover from it.” said David Levine, a former local election official who is now a fellow with the Alliance for Securing Democracy.Among those listening to the presentations at the Tennessee conference was Luann Adler, a retired educator and school administrator who said she has lost confidence in elections after reading articles and watching videos online about voting machines. She has been advocating in her community to ban voting machines and limit voting to a single day.Serving as a poll worker last year, Adler said, she did not observe any problems. Still, the experience did not change her mind.“As we have seen today, a machine can be manipulated,” Adler said. “I’m not pointing the finger at any individual or any community as being nefarious, but I don’t trust the machine.”___Associated Press writers Michelle R.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839545,"Florida Atlantic edges Memphis 66-65, 1st March Madness win","COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Nicholas Boyd drove to the basket through traffic and converted a floater with 2.5 seconds left to make history for Florida Atlantic.The play by the second-year guard off an inbounds pass from Johnell Davis will go down in Florida Atlantic lore as it secured the first NCAA Tournament win in school history, 66-65 over Memphis in a rugged, back-and-forth game.It was just the second trip to the tournament — and the first since 2002 — for the ninth-seeded Owls, who advanced to face a surprising opponent, No. 16 seed Fairleigh Dickinson, in the second round of the East Region. The Knights knocked off top seed Purdue in one of the biggest upsets in March Madness history.Coach Penny Hardaway’s eighth-seeded Tigers (26-9) had the ball and a one-point lead with 19 seconds left, but a steal by Brandon Weatherspoon and a subsequent jump ball — Hardaway argued his team had called timeout before the tie-up — gave the Owls (32-3) a chance.Boyd said he implored coach Dusty May to let him take the go-ahead shot.“In the timeout, I said, ‘Coach, I got it,’"" Boyd said. ""I don’t know why I was feeling that way, but I just said, ‘Coach, let me get the ball.’ I caught it in the corner. I was going to shoot the 3. He jumped for the shot fake. And Vlad (Goldin) had a great seal, allowed me to get to the rim. I just thought about finishing no matter what.”The fifth-year coach was good with that.“Also, we felt like Memphis was really going to key on Davis and (Alijah) Martin, our two leading scorers, our two first-team all-leaguers. So we thought we could use them as a decoy,” May said. “And Nick is a very talented scorer. He got space in the corner, had a lot of room to work.”Hardaway chucked a water bottle in frustration after Memphis let the game slip away.“Crazy game from start to finish,"" he said. ""It hurts more giving up a layup for the win. You work the whole year talking about defense, and hang your hat on defense, we needed one stop. Couldn’t get that one stop.”Giancarlo Rosado scored 15 points to lead FAU, and Davis had 12.“It’s good — but we’re not done yet,"" Rosado said. ""We didn’t come here to win one game. We didn’t come here to win two games. We came to win it because that’s what we do. We’ve proved that we’re a Top 25 program. Half of the season we were Top 25. We’ve proved we’re supposed to be here. We’re not doing nothing we’re not supposed to be doing.”Kendric Davis scored 16 points despite being hobbled by a second-half leg injury for Memphis. Davis also got into a shouting match with teammate Malcolm Dandridge, who shoved Davis during a second-half timeout.DeAndre Williams added 13 points while playing most of the second half with four fouls for the Tigers, including a tip-in that put his team ahead 65-64 with 34 seconds left.BIG PICTUREFlorida Atlantic: The Owls from Boca Raton won the Conference USA title to make the tournament for the second time, 21 years after their first appearance. The school will move to the American Athletic Conference next season, where Memphis will be an annual foe.Memphis: The Tigers led for most of the second half but couldn't pull away.“It’s a heartbreaker,"" Kendric Davis said. ""We worked hard all year to put ourselves in this position. And we just didn’t. Starts with me. I had a big turnover. You think about what you could have done. We didn’t get it done.”SHOTS WON'T FALLNo player on either team made more than two 3-pointers. Not that they didn't try, especially in the first half. Florida Atlantic was 8 for 28 and Memphis was 6 for 22 from beyond the arc. The teams combined for five 3-point tries in the second half as the game stayed tight.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/18,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839547,"Kansas St tops Montana St, 1st March Madness win since 2018","GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) — Markquis Nowell had 17 points and 14 assists and No. 3 seed Kansas State held off 14th-seeded Montana State 77-65 Friday night for its first NCAA Tournament win since knocking off Kentucky in 2018 to reach the Elite Eight.Now the two Wildcat programs will meet again in a rematch on Sunday in the second round of the NCAA Tournament. Kentucky, the sixth seed, defeated No. 11 Providence 61-53 in the earlier game.Kentucky fans packed the Greensboro Coliseum for the first game, and they are likely to provide a home-court advantage of sorts.But first-year Kansas State coach Jerome Tang isn't expected to be intimidated. Tang was an assistant coach on the Baylor staff that ended Kentucky's 55-game win streak at Rupp Arena in 2012. The Bears also beat Kentucky in two neutral site games, and he feels K-State will have plenty of support.“I understand how the Cats travel, but our Cats travel, too,” Tang said.Nowell and fellow third-team Associated Press All-American Keyontae Johnson, who had 18 points and eight rebounds, proved too much for the Bobcats to handle. Nowell's used his quickness to create shots for himself and his teammates and Montana State didn't have anyone physical enough to guard Johnson.“We don't have too many guys like that in our league,” Montana State coach Danny Sprinkle said.RaeQuan Battle had 26 points on 9 of 17 shooting for Montana State (25-10), which had its eight-game win steak snapped.Montana State simply didn’t have the size to hang with Kansas State, who outscored the Bobcats 48-30 in the paint.“It’s a big emphasis on getting to the paint,” Johnson said. “When you get to the paint, it draws so much attention, and we have dynamic players, dynamic guards that can get to the paint and create for each other. You just saw it today. When we play together and for each other, we’re a really good team.”Kansas State (24-9) led Montana State 34-28 at the break, and the Wildcats stretched the lead to 13 with 11 minutes remaining when Desi Sills scoring on a layup off an inbounds pass under his own basket after a botched defensive assignment.Montana State went to a 1-3-1 defense, which disrupted the Wildcats for a short time and helped cut the lead to eight before Nowell buried a deep 3-pointer from the left wing and Nae'Qwan Tomlin scored off a lob to push the lead back to 13.Montana State wouldn't quit though, with Darius Brown knocking down a 3 with 2:44 left.But Tomlin, who finished with 13 points, answered with another dunk off after Nowell threaded the needle with his 14th assist, tying a personal career best and establishing a record for the most ever by a Kansas State player in an NCAA Tournament game.“I have to give credit to my teammates for getting open and finishing the plays,” Nowell said. “It was just a well-executed ball game and game plan that the coaching staff came up with, and the players, we executed it. I have to give a lot of credit to my teammates.”David N'Guessan added two two technical foul free throws and then scored on an inside layup. Sills punctuated the win with a breakaway left-handed dunk giving the Wildcats a 16-point lead.BIG PICTUREMontana State: The Bobcats were looking for a better showing after losing by 35 points in the opening round of last year's tournament to Texas Tech and they got it. The Big Sky champions showed they can compete on the NCAA Tournament stage but in the end didn't have the size to compete with the Wildcats. “We just kept battling back and battling back and battling back. We couldn’t get over that hump tonight,"" Sprinkle said.Kansas State: The Wildcats had some concerns coming into the tournament after back-to-back losses to West Virginia and TCU. It was a struggle at times, but the Wildcats finished with a flurry to seal the win.UP NEXTKansas State beat Kentucky 61-58 on March 22, 2018, for its first win over those Wildcats in 10 tries.___Follow Steve Reed on Twitter at https://twitter.com/SteveReedAP___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839548,West spotlights North Korea rights abuses; China opposes,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The United States, its Western allies and experts shone a spotlight on the dire human rights situation and increasing repression in North Korea at a U.N. meeting Friday that China and Russia denounced as a politicized move likely to further escalate tensions on the Korean peninsula.China blocked the U.S. from broadcasting the informal Security Council meeting globally on the internet, a decision criticized by U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield as an attempt to hide North Korea’s “atrocities from the world.”Webcasting requires agreement by all 15 council members. But the U.S. envoy said Beijing’s effort was in vain because the meeting will be made public, and the U.S. and many others will continue to speak out against Pyongyang’s human rights abuses and threats to international peace.James Turpin, a senior official in the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, said the ongoing tensions on the Korean peninsula pose a threat to regional and international peace and security, and “these tensions cannot be separated from the dire human rights situation in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea,” the North’s official name.Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, North Korea has been isolated. The United Nations has no international staff in the country and Turpin said this “coincides with an increase in the repression of civil and political rights.”He pointed to stronger government measures to prevent people from getting access to information from the outside world, an extreme level of surveillance, people's homes being subjected to random search for material not authorized by the state, and punishments for anyone trying to exercise basic rights including freedom of expression, religion and peaceful assembly.Elizabeth Salmon, the U.N. special investigator on human rights in North Korea, also stressed “the interdependence of international peace and security and human rights,” saying peace and denuclearization can’t be addressed without considering the current human rights violations.She told the meeting that the limited information available shows the suffering of the North Korean people has increased and their already limited liberties have declined. Access to food, medicine and health care remains a priority concern, “people have frozen to death during the cold spells in January,” and some didn’t have money to heat their homes while others were forced to live on the streets because they sold their homes as a last resort.Xing Jisheng, a counsellor at China’s U.N. Mission, criticized the U.S. for discussing human rights in the Security Council whose mandate is ensuring international peace and security, saying it “is not constructive in any way.” Instead of easing tension, he said, “it may rather intensify the conflict, and therefore it’s an irresponsible move.”“Using U.N. WebTV for live broadcast is a waste of U.N. resources,” Xing added, saying if countries are really concerned about the situation on the Korean peninsula and well-being of the people they should work to relaunch dialogue, de-escalate tensions, and support lifting sanctions that affect the livelihood of North Koreans and the country's deteriorating humanitarian situation.Stepan Kuzmenkov, a senior counsellor at Russia’s U.N. Mission, echoed China’s opposition to having the Security Council discuss human rights and said there were no grounds for convening the meeting “which has a clear anti-North Korean bent.”He accused the U.S. of using human rights “to settle scores with the governments not to their liking” and condemned what he called “streams of disinformation” about North Korea disseminated by the U.S. and its allies “on the pretext that they’re trying to protect human rights.”“What we see is that the United States, South Korea and Japan are engaging in aggressive, militaristic activities, thereby whipping up tensions in northeastern Asia, putting the security of countries in the region at risk,” Kuzmenov said. “The Americans are ignoring initiatives which would help ease tensions as well as the substantive and constructive signals (North Korean leader) Kim Jong Un is sending, which could bring about possible de-escalation.”America’s Thomas-Greenfield countered that “the regime’s widespread human rights abuses and its threats to our collective security could not be clearer.”North Korea's ballistic missile and weapons of mass destruction programs threaten international peace and security and are “inextricably linked to the regime’s human rights abuses,” she said.“In the DPRK, the pursuit of weapons of mass destruction always, always trumps human rights and humanitarian needs of its people,” Thomas-Greenfield said.",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839549,Princeton women top NC State 64-63 in March Madness opener,"SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Grace Stone is making a habit of game-winning jumpers for the streaking Princeton Tigers.“She’s got ice in her veins. She has that look in her eyes and you know she’s gonna make a play. She’s gonna hit a shot,” Princeton coach Carla Berube said.Stone scored 22 points, including her fifth 3-pointer of the game with 4.7 seconds remaining, to lift 10th-seeded Princeton to a thrilling 64-63 win over North Carolina State in the first round of the women’s NCAA Tournament on Friday night.“That’s a shot I’ve taken in a game before and my teammates have all the confidence in the world in me,” said Stone, who hit game-winners against Columbia and Rhode Island earlier this season.Kaitlyn Chen, who also scored 22 points, made a 3-pointer with 55 seconds remaining to cut the Tigers’ deficit to 63-61 and then Madison St. Rose and Stone both came up with steals in the final minute to give the Tigers a chance.On North Carolina State’s final possession, the Tigers created chaos — as they had done all game long — and knocked the ball loose to prevent the seventh-seeded Wolfpack from getting a shot off.St. Rose “got her hand on the ball and then I think everybody dove on the ball,” Berube said, who was then drenched by a “water party “ in the locker room and conducted her press conference all wet.The Tigers (24-5), who held the Wolfpack scoreless for the final 5:43 of the game, ran to the center of the court screaming for jubilation at their unlikely victory.It’s the second straight season that Princeton has won a first-round game. The Tigers beat Kentucky last season before falling to Indiana in the second round by a point.The Tigers' men’s and women’s teams are the first Ivy League duo to both advance in the NCAA Tournament after the men's team upset second-seeded Arizona on Thursday.“We watched that game and looked at each other and said, ‘All right, we’re next. It’s our turn,’” said Julia Cunningham, who had 14 points and eight assists for the Tigers.Mimi Collins scored 14 points and Madison Hayes and Jaki Brown-Turner each had 10 points but the Wolfpack missed their final five shots and had five turnovers down the stretch.“We got the shots that we wanted. Some of them rimmed in and out. They’re defense was good, but I feel like ... our shots just weren’t falling,” Collins said.Aziaha James was the catalyst in pushing the Wolfpack’s (20-12) lead to 63-55 with a steal and back-to-back layups with 5:44 to play but they didn't score again.“It’s a tough loss. Heartbreaking,” North Carolina State coach Wes Moore said.The Tigers scored the first 10 points of the third quarter but then went cold against the Wolfpack’s defensive pressure. North Carolina State regained the lead 55-51 by forcing 12 straight misses from Princeton over the final 6:52 of the period.“We’ve gone through stretches where we’ve struggled to score and we know that our defense is going to keep us in games,” Stone said and cited their motto — ‘Defense Travels!’The Wolfpack started the game missing point guard and leading scorer Diamond Johnson, who has an ankle injury that has been hobbling her for weeks. They seemed out of sorts and missed their first seven shots.To make matters worse, her backup James, who got the start, suffered a lower leg injury with 9:21 left in the second quarter and had to be helped off the court. She later returned to spark North Carolina State.But the Wolfpack used their physical advantage inside to stake a 41-35 halftime lead on the strength of post players Collins and Hayes both scoring 10 points off the bench in the first half.The Tigers have now won 16 in a row heading into a matchup with host Utah (the second seed) on Sunday afternoon.“Wow! Just so thrilled with that win. I mean, that’s what it’s all about,” Berube said as the Tigers advanced. “Now we just need to take that next step.”BIG PICTUREPrinceton: The Tigers used defense when their offense sputtered and came up big when it mattered most. The Tigers only allowed 52.5 points a game this year and their tenacity won the day even when they got down by eight points.NC State: The Wolfpack arrived with their lowest seed since 2016-17 but seemed to have the talent and strength to control the game. But the Wolfpack couldn’t get clean looks when the Tigers got desperate and disruptive. ___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839550,"Tatum scores 34, Celtics hold off Trail Blazers 126-112","PORTLAND, Ore (AP) — Jayson Tatum had 34 points and 12 rebounds, and the Boston Celtics withstood a late Portland rally for a 126-112 victory over the struggling Trail Blazers on Friday night.Jaylen Brown added 27 points for the Celtics, who have won four of their last five after a three-game losing streak. Boston sits behind NBA-leading Milwaukee in the Eastern Conference.Damian Lillard finished with 41 points — including 25 in the fourth quarter — for the Blazers, who have lost five straight. At 13th in the West, Portland hasn't yet been eliminated from the playoffs but time was running out with just 12 games remaining.“This is the time of year where teams, you know, you can't wait until the next step,” said Al Horford, who finished with 12 points and 11 assists for Boston. “But you have to play these games. You have to. We need to continue to play good basketball and get better.”Boston led by as many as 21 points in the third quarter. Lillard's 3-pointer pulled Portland within 109-96 and he hit another 3 to close the gap to 111-103. Lillard scored 18 straight Blazers points at one point.The teams exchanged free throws before Brown dunked and Horford hit a 3-pointer to put Boston up 118-105 with 1:33 left and all but seal the win.“The game is never going to be perfect. It's the NBA, they're going to make shots, make runs. I tell you guys all time, it's how you respond,” Tatum said.Tatum (hip) and Marcus Smart (non-COVID illness) were questionable before the game but both started for the Celtics. Malcolm Brogdon sat out with right Achilles tendon soreness.Grant Williams' 3-pointer put the Celtics up 42-30 in the second quarter. Boston led by as many as 16 in the half to go ahead 63-48 at the break. Tatum led all scorers with 19 points.The Celtics extended the lead to as many as 19 points in the third quarter.“We haven't had many games where we don't give it our all. Game like tonight, we played a team that's let's face it, better than us. That's one of the elite teams in the league,” Blazers coach Chauncey Billups said. “When you play against teams like that, you can't shoot yourself in the foot, because you've got to play pretty much an outstanding game to have a shot. But we kept fighting, we kept scrapping.”TIP-INSCeltics: With a steal in the opening quarter, Smart became the fourth Boston player to reach 900 career steals. ... It was fourth of a six-game road trip for the Celtics. ... The Celtics won the first of the two meetings with the Blazers 115-93 on March 8.Trail Blazers: Starting forward Jerami Grant missed his second game with a left quad contusion. ... The Blazers were also without Nassir Little because of illness. ... Portland announced earlier in the day that forward Justise Winslow underwent a bone marrow treatment on his left ankle. He has not played since spraining his ankle in December.QUOTABLE“Even when it seems like it’s out of reach, I’m going to go out there and compete and I’m going to try to make something happen regardless of how realistic or unrealistic it is and live with the results,"" Lillard said.Lillard has scored at least 20 points in 30 straight games, the longest streak of his career, and the longest current streak in the NBA.UP NEXTCeltics: Visit the Utah Jazz on Saturday night.Trail Blazers: Host the Clippers on Sunday night.___More AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839551,"Coles hits late floater, TCU edges Ariz St in March Madness","DENVER (AP) — Watching from the bench for most of last season, JaKobe Coles patiently waited his turn.His reward came Friday night, a floater from the lane with 1.5 seconds left that lifted No. 6 seed TCU to a come-from-behind 72-70 win over 11th-seeded Arizona State in the first round of the NCAA Tournament.“He didn’t have the role he wanted,” said Mike Miles Jr., the teammate who talked him into coming to TCU and fed him the pass that led to the winning bucket. “But this year he’s getting the minutes he wanted. He’s stepping up. In the biggest game of his life, he made the game-winning shot.”Coles took the pass from Miles from the top of the 3-point circle, dribbled once, took two steps and let go of the game-winner.A desperation heave by Arizona State guard Frankie Collins at the buzzer missed everything, and left coach Bobby Hurley wondering if he should have used a timeout to set up a play.“It’s certainly something I’ll think about,” Hurley said.While TCU (22-12) advanced to play Gonzaga on Sunday, Arizona State's season ended in heart-breaking fashion. Nobody could say the Sun Devils (23-13) didn't put on a show.They took an 11-point lead early in the second half punctuated by a pair of highlight-reel dunks. One was from Collins — with a defender draped all over him — and another from Devan Cambridge, who finished a fast break with a backward power slam.That's when TCU started chipping away.A pair of free throws by Damion Baugh — and another by Miles — gave the Horned Frogs a three-point lead with 24 seconds remaining.DJ Horne, who finished with 17 points, answered with a deep 3-pointer to tie it up at 70 with 15 seconds left.It was just setting the stage for Coles, who finished with 11 points.“It was a good shot,” Coles said. “I’m happy for my team, happy for the win.”Miles, playing on a hyperextended right knee, had 26 points, including 12 of 14 from the free throw line.He was noticeably limping shortly after a dunk late in the first half. Miles was greeted by the trainer as he walked off the court for halftime, but returned after the break. The Horned Frogs needed him, too, as made big play after big play. He drew a pivotal charge late in the game.Miles missed a stretch of games in early February with a hyperextended right knee.As much as the last-second shot, TCU coach Jamie Dixon credited the win to his team committing only five turnovers, which matched its season low. Those turnovers led to only four ASU points.Possibly still a little weary from their trip in from Dayton, Ohio, the Sun Devils took a moment to get acclimated. The 11 seed was down 11 before even breaking much of a sweat. But they quickly found their rhythm — just like they did two days ago, when they scored 98 points in a First Four win over Nevada.“Just heartbroken for my guys,” Hurley said. “They played winning basketball all year, played unselfishly, battled and fought and it took a last-second shot to put us away.”BIG PICTUREArizona State: The Sun Devils are definitely back on the right track after going 14-17 last season and 11-14 in 2020-21. Asked about the state of the program, Hurley responded: “Did you watch the game? That’s the state of the program.”TCU: The Horned Frogs improved to 7-9 all-time in the NCAA Tournament.UP NEXTTCU and Gonzaga haven’t met on the basketball floor since a 90-87 Horned Frogs win on Dec. 30, 1998. But there’s plenty of respect on the part of Bulldogs coach Mark Few. “I’ve watched TCU a lot this year. I think they’re as good of team as there is in this tournament, especially when they’re at their high end,” said Few, whose team is the third seed in the West Region.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/18,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839560,Burling's Kiwis take lead in SailGP regatta in home waters,"Peter Burling steered his Kiwi catamaran to finishes of second, first and second in home waters to take the lead in the New Zealand Sail Grand Prix Christchurch on Saturday.Burling had a strong day in gusty conditions in front of thousands of Kiwi fans. He's looking to solidify Team New Zealand's spot in the Season 3 standings in tech tycoon Larry Ellison's global league and earn a spot in the season-ending $1 million, winner-take-all, three-boat Grand Final in early May.The Kiwis scored 28 points, four ahead of Canada and its New Zealand-born skipper, Phil Robertson. Sir Ben Ainslie has Emirates Great Britain in third with 23 points while Quentin Delapierre's French team is fourth with 21. Tom Slingsby and two-time defending champion Australia was fifth with 18 points and Jimmy Spithill of Team USA sixth with 16 points in the fleet of nine foiling 50-foot catamarans.Racing was delayed 40 minutes after a dolphin was spotted on the course. That gave the Kiwis time to fix some issues with their boat.“We’re really sailing on their home turf so we’ve got to be patient at times,"" Burling said of the dolphin sighting. ""We’re fortunate today that they decided to shift off and let us get three amazing races in.”There will be three more fleet races Sunday, with the top three teams advancing to the podium race.The Kiwis weren't able to do any practice sailing due to the technical problems but still sailed well in SailGP's first regatta in New Zealand.“It’s been amazing seeing how many people are coming down to cheer us on from every vantage point around Lyttelton Harbor,"" said Burling, the reigning two-time America's Cup champion helmsman and a three-time Olympic medalist. ""It's been great to see the support from home fans and it means the world to be able to put on a good show for them today.”Australia sits atop the season leaderboard with 76 points, 12 ahead of the Kiwis. There's only three points separating New Zealand, France and Britain. The Aussies have all but clinched a spot in the Grand Final at the end of the San Francisco regatta May 6-7 and the rival Kiwis hope to join them.Slingsby said Friday that he would love to upstage the Kiwis in their home event. But Burling bested his rival in every race.Slingsby, an Olympic gold medalist and former America's Cup champion, was fourth in the first race, which was won by France, and had an early lead in Race 2 but finished a distant second to Burling. The Aussies hit a patch of seaweed in the third race and finished last.“If I'm honest, we're still not sailing that great,” Slingsby said. “Usually in those conditions, 15 knots, we're just sort of charging through the fleet and sailing well. No excuses, we're just not sailing as well as we could. The Kiwis just sailed past us from behind us, so they're just sailing better. Simple as that.”Burling committed a boundary penalty in the pre-start of Race 3 and had to start last but sped through the fleet and finished second, just behind Canada.Spithill needs a strong regatta to have any chance of reaching the Grand Final but went 8-5-5 on Saturday.___AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839561,Jones' breakaway goal leads Ducks past Blue Jackets 7-4,"ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) — Max Jones scored the tiebreaking goal on a breakaway with 2:37 remaining and the Anaheim Ducks beat the Columbus Blue Jackets 7-4 Friday night in a matchup of teams near the bottom of the NHL standings.Jones blocked the shot of Columbus' Andrew Peeke as he was trying to bump the puck into the Blue Jackets' offensive zone. The shot went off the shaft of Jones' stick, before he was able to gain possession of the puck near center ice. Jones then beat Michael Hutchinson with a backhand on his stick side for his seventh goal of the season.“It was a big goal. Definitely one of the bigger ones I have scored,” Jones said. “I told myself I was going to shoot on it, but when I crossed the blue line I saw his angles were a little off. I figured I had to go backhand with it, so it worked out.""Scott Harrington had two goals for the Ducks, who snapped a two-game losing streak. It was also the first multi-goal game of the defenseman's nine-year career and came against the team where he played for six seasons.“He's a guy that’s not known for scoring or putting up points, but to get a couple is awesome for him, and his teammates on the bench were cheering them on,” Ducks coach Dallas Eakins said of Harrington, who has 10 goals in 246 NHL games.Troy Terry and Ryan Strome each had a goal and an assist, Trevor Zegras and Max Comtois also scored and Simon Benoit had two assists for Anaheim. Lukas Dostal stopped 38 shots.Patrik Laine had a goal and an assist for Columbus, which has dropped two straight and became the first team eliminated from postseason contention. Nick Blankenburg, Boone Jenner and Cole Sillinger also scored, and Hutchinson made 31 saves and also had an assist.Harrington and Strome added empty-netters in the final minute to seal the Ducks' win.The Blue Jackets have a league-low 49 points while the Ducks have the fourth-lowest at 56.“We had some good looks there, even in the third, we were coming. I thought we found our game pretty good there for a bit,” Blue Jackets coach Brad Larson said. ""We try to get it deep, it hits a shaft, and then we’re chasing there at the end.Terry reached the 20-goal mark for the second straight season and gave the Ducks a 4-3 lead 2:25 into the third period when he redirected Colton White's pass past Hutchinson.Laine evened it at 6:43 on the power play when he put in his own rebound after Dostal made a pad save on the initial shot from the slot.LEADING THE WAYZegras and Jenner, who lead their respective teams in goals, each found the net during the first period.Zegras opened the scoring at 3:19 when he got a pass from Strome and scored into an open net after Hutchinson thought Strome was going to shoot. It was Zegras' 22nd of the season and also gave him 10 points (three goals, seven assists) in the last 10 games.Jenner tied it at 2 with 31 seconds remaining in the first period when he went top corner from inside the right faceoff circle for his 23rd.SILLINGER'S DROUGHT ENDSSillinger scored for the first time in 46 games during a power play at 16:35 of the second period to tie it at 3. The Blue Jackets center tipped in Kent Johnson's pass from the right faceoff circle for his first goal since Nov. 17 against Montreal.Sillinger, the NHL's youngest player last season, had 16 goals and 31 points as a rookie. He has only three goals and 10 points this season.“It feels pretty good, but one goal in however many games, I obviously demand more of myself. But, it’s a good start,” Sillinger said.UP NEXTBlue Jackets: At Vegas Golden Knights on Sunday.Ducks: Host the Vancouver Canucks on Sunday.___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839562,Jackson-Davis leads Indiana past Kent State in March Madness,"ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — Trayce Jackson-Davis made staying up late worthwhile for Indiana fans.The All-American did it all with 24 points, 11 rebounds, five blocked shots and five assists as Indiana defeated 13th-seed Kent State 71-60 Friday night to reach the second round of the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2016.The fourth-seeded Hoosiers (23-11) advanced to play fifth-seeded Miami on Sunday for a trip to Kansas City for the Midwest Region semifinals.Jackson-Davis became the first player since blocks became an official NCAA statistic in 1985-86 to have at least 20 points, 10 rebounds, five blocks and five assists in an NCAA Tournament game, according to OptaSTATS.“We’re not trying to hide how we play. He’s been the focal point of our offense, and he’s got to anchor our defense, rebounding and blocking shots for us,” second-year Indiana coach Mike Woodson said.The last of 32 first-round games to tip off was played in front of mostly Indiana fans and their team delivered a no-drama victory to cap what was already a pretty good day. Earlier, the Hoosiers' in-state, Big Ten rival Purdue became the second No. 1 seed in the history of the tournament to lose to a 16 seed when Fairleigh Dickinson pulled the stunner in Columbus, Ohio.The Mid-American Conference champs from Kent State couldn't muster any such magic, shooting 32% from the field. Sincere Carry scored 15 points to lead the Golden Flashes (28-7), who had won six straight heading into tournament under former Indiana assistant coach Rob Senderoff.“It wasn't for lack of effort at all,” Senderoff said. “It just, you know, shots didn't fall.”Well past midnight, Jackson-Davis gave MVP Arena a jolt with six straight spectacular points in the second half. The run started with a one-handed dunk, soaring down the lane.“I finally got a little bit of a groove and had a big play, an energy play,” Jackson-Davis said. “Whenever that happens, my teammates try to get me the ball and they put me in great positions.”A smooth baseline drive was next, followed by a spinning layup to make it 62-50 with 7:39 left.“I thought he made about three or four plays down the stretch to put the game out of reach,” Woodson said.Race Thompson matched a season high with 20 points for the Hoosiers on 8-of-11 shooting.The Hoosiers had a 35-27 at halftime as Thompson took advantage of a Kent State defense that was working hard to limit Jackson-Davis. Thompson scored 13 points on 5-of-6 shooting.Meanwhile, Jackson-Davis more than made his presence felt with 10 points, seven rebounds, four assists and three blocks, including a chase down swat of Jalen Sullinger's layup in the final seconds of the half.“The big, Davis, he dominated tonight. So props to him,” Sullinger said.BIG PICTUREKent State: Its last NCAA victory was in 2002, when the Golden Flashes made a surprising run to the Elite Eight before being eliminated by Indiana.Indiana: The Hoosiers played around a quiet night from star freshman Jalen Hood Schifino, who scored eight points while dealing with foul trouble.UP NEXTIndiana: The Hoosiers have played the Hurricanes once, losing 58-53 in Miami in December 2001.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/18,,World

In Singapore, pneumonia is the third leading cause of death[8] and fourth most common cause of hospitalisations[9]           Offers the broadest serotype coverage of any pneumococcal conjugate vaccine currently available, building on Pfizer's more than 20-year legacy and innovation in developing pneumococcal conjugate vaccines               Approval of APEXXNAR in Singapore, the first in Southeast Asia, aligns with Singapore's Healthier SG Strategy to place a sustained focus on preventive care in achieving overall healthier living            SINGAPORE -    Media OutReach - 18 March 2023 - Pfizer announced today that the Singapore Health Sciences Authority (HSA) has approved its 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV20) that protects against invasive pneumococcal disease and pneumonia caused by 20    Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) serotypes. Marketed under the brand name APEXXNAR, this vaccine is approved for active immunisation for individuals aged 18 years and older, advancing the company's ongoing commitment to help prevent certain potentially-serious infectious respiratory diseases.       The approval of APEXXNAR in Singapore, being the first in Southeast Asia, underscores Pfizer's 20 years of growing legacy and experience in developing and supplying innovative pneumococcal conjugate vaccines that have had a pivotal impact on the global disease burden. This approval also supports Singapore's Healthier SG initiative that focuses on improving population health and quality of life through proactive preventive care, regular screening and recommended vaccinations.       ""Singapore's approval of APEXXNAR today signals the importance of continually addressing the ever-evolving burden of pneumococcal disease. This is especially critical against the rapidly ageing landscape to ensure comprehensive coverage for the population,"" said Erika Pagani, Country Manager, Pfizer Singapore. ""As the country progresses towards a Healthier SG, Pfizer looks forward to continue playing a key role to protect adults from this widespread life-threatening disease.""       According to the Singapore Ministry of Health, pneumonia is the fourth most common cause for hospitalisation[9] and third leading cause of death[8], responsible for more than 4000 deaths annually[10]. Singapore continues to face a rising burden of the disease in light of the increasing prevalence of new infectious variants and a rapidly ageing population.       ""Despite its severity and burden on the population, the awareness surrounding pneumococcal disease and the uptake of the vaccine in Singapore remains relatively low,"" said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, Infectious Disease expert at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. ""With the approval of APEXXNAR, and in line with the Healthier SG initiative, we encourage all adults to take proactive steps towards preventive care and vaccinate against this disease.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839580,"Maxi Kleber hits 3 at buzzer, Mavericks stun Lakers 111-110","LOS ANGELES (AP) — Maxi Kleber drilled the winning 3-pointer at the buzzer on a crosscourt pass from Kyrie Irving, who scored 38 points in the Dallas Mavericks' stunning 111-110 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers on Friday night.With Luka Doncic sidelined, Kleber did a remarkable imitation of the injured superstar who has repeatedly beaten the Lakers with big shots over the years. The German big man’s teammates piled on him in celebration after he silenced the Lakers' crowd with his only 3-pointer of the night.“I never had a shot like that before,"" said a grinning Kleber, who scored six of his 10 points in the final 7.2 seconds.Kleber first hit three free throws after Anthony Davis unwisely fouled him on a 3-point attempt, and Davis made just one of two for Los Angeles with 6.7 seconds left after getting fouled on the ensuing inbounds pass. Dallas got the ball to Irving, who drew a double-team and found Kleber for an open 3-pointer released over Davis' outstretched arm just before the horn.“When he passed it, I knew I had to just quick-fire it,” Kleber said. “It was a pretty amazing feeling. Once I let it go, I saw the ball in the air, and I was like, ‘Oh, damn, it has a chance to go in.’ All of a sudden it went in, and the next thing I knew, the whole team was running at me. It was a pretty cool experience.”The play also was redemption for Kleber, who threw away an inbounds pass with 1.8 seconds left in regulation against San Antonio on Wednesday night. The Spurs subsequently tied it and went on to win in overtime.“Knowing Ky, he wanted to go for the win,” Mavs coach Jason Kidd said about the final play. “With the double team, he had to give the ball up. That's just trust with his teammates, and Maxi was at the right place at the right time.”Irving scored 13 points in the fourth quarter of his return from a three-game injury absence for the Mavs, who avoided falling into a three-way tie with the Lakers and the Timberwolves in the tight Western Conference standings.“We fought hard to get back into the game, so that's a tough one,” said Davis, who also missed crucial last-minute free throws in losses to Boston and Philadelphia. “You've got to be able to win basketball games, whether it's at the free throw line, or me making the right read defensively.”Davis had 26 points and 10 rebounds before making a handful of enormous last-minute mistakes for the Lakers, who missed 12 of their 31 free throw attempts and couldn't make a field goal in the final 3:16 of another blow to their playoff hopes. Los Angeles led by four points and had the ball with less than 20 seconds to play, but still lost for the third time in four games.“We make our free throws, we're probably not having this conversation,” Lakers coach Darvin Ham said.Austin Reaves scored 16 points for Los Angeles, and Dennis Schröder had 15. Los Angeles overcame a nine-point deficit to begin the fourth quarter, but choked down the stretch with LeBron James watching in street clothes.James sat out his 10th straight game since the Lakers' win in Dallas last month, and the Lakers fell to 5-5 without the NBA's career scoring leader.TIP-INSMavericks: Doncic missed his fourth consecutive game with a left thigh bruise. He hopes to return early next week. ... Irving played 39 minutes after missing the past three games with a sore right foot, while Tim Hardaway Jr. scored scored 12 points after sitting out Dallas’ last game with a bruised left calf.Lakers: Coach Darvin Ham said James' rehabilitation sessions are going well. The 20-year veteran is scheduled to be re-examined next week. ... D'Angelo Russell struggled, getting 11 points and 11 assists while going 0-for-6 on his 3-point attempts.UP NEXTMavericks: At Memphis on Monday night.Lakers: Host Orlando on Sunday night.___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/18,,World

This causes a repetitive layer to form around an organ, which can lead to improper functioning. This can lead to scarring. Fibrosis can occur in many organs, and it is often called by its specific location. For example, fibrosis of the lungs is called pulmonary fibrosis. While fibrosis of the liver is called cirrhosis, it is fibrosis of the liver. Kidney disease can cause kidney fibrosis. This can be from chronic kidney disease (CKD), to end-stage renal disease. This condition causes the kidneys to stop functioning and eventually require transplantation. Various medications that are available in the market for the treatment of kidney fibrosis are Renin inhibitors, Vasopeptidase inhibitors, Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and Pirfenidone.

It said that after three rounds of bidding, the contract for the procurement of the trains had been awarded based on safety, operational capability, technology, and price.“After many negotiations with the preferred contract manufacturer, the board of directors decided today to award the bid to the Hitachi-Toshiba Alliance,” the corporation's board said in a statement. The N700S trains will replace the current 700T series that has been in operation since 2007.The announcement is good news for the relationship between THSRC and Japanese rolling stock manufacturers, as it previously looked unlikely the two sides would reach a deal. Reports in March 2022 said the high-speed rail operator’s negotiations with Japanese companies had stalled, and that they were looking for suppliers outside of Japan due to the country's companies offering “unreasonable” prices.A delivery date has yet to be finalized.",2023/3/18,4358,Society

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839658,Taiwan mask mandate on public transport could end mid-April,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — If the downward trend of the COVID-19 pandemic continues, the end of mask mandates on public transport could be scheduled for April, the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) said Saturday (March 18).The latest data saw 7,825 new local infections reported, or 7.33% fewer than the previous Saturday, while 35 people were listed as new deaths and 201 as imported cases.The April 1-5 Tomb Sweeping Holiday is expected to act as an important factor in the decision-making on the ending of more restrictions, as previous holidays have been followed by minor upswings, UDN reported.CECC Spokesman Philip Lo (羅一鈞) said that regular COVID tests for hospital patients and relatives accompanying them could end on April 10. The tests would only continue for people who showed symptoms of coronavirus.However, in order to safeguard the health of patients and staff, the wearing of masks inside hospitals would still be required, even after April, he said.A decision about mask mandates on buses, trains, and Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) trains would depend on the situation of the pandemic in mid-April, when the impact of the Tomb Sweeping Holiday was clear, according to Lo.The daily number of new COVID cases is expected to drop next week, as from Monday (March 20), it will no longer be required to report and quarantine light cases.",2023/3/18,3012,Society

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839663,"Opinion: China in mind, Philippines cozies up to US","Foreign Policy magazine recently opined that the Philippines had become the US's new star ally in Asia, basing its verdict on the country's strengthened military partnership with the United States. In February, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. told the financial newspaper Nikkei Asia that the closer ties are a response to the new geopolitical realities of the region. ""When we look at the situation in the area, especially the tensions in the Taiwan Strait,"" Marcos said, we can see that just by our geographical location, should there in fact be conflict in that area ... it's very hard to imagine a scenario where the Philippines will not somehow get involved.""The number of US troops stationed on Philippine islands will be increased significantly. This applies especially to the north, near Taiwan. US soldiers will be given permission to use two bases in this area. From here, troops could quickly de deployed should China's army blockade Taiwan. Kaohsiung, a city on Taiwan's southern coast, is the 15th-busiest container port in the world. There would be global repercussions and immediate consequences for the Philippines should the port again be blocked by Chinese forces, as occurred temporarily in August following the visit of US lawmaker Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan.In another interview, Marcos quoted the old proverb ""when elephants fight, it is the grass that suffers."" The message, of course, is that the proverbial elephants are China and the United States and the Philippines is the grass.The Philippines is not seeking conflict with China. The country intends to pursue the path that most Asian countries have taken: cooperate with China economically, yet acquire security guarantees from the United States. The Philippines, like almost all countries in the region, has been entangled in territorial conflicts with China, which is in the US's favor. Though China claims to recognize neighboring countries' right to sovereignty as enshrined in the UN Charter, it has also attempted to annex territories and maritime areas that it does not have a claim to.The Spratly Islands are a case in point. In 2016, a court in the Hague declared that China has no claim whatsoever to the islands, the largest of which are claimed by the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and Taiwan. However, it remains Chinese President Xi Jinping's goal to bring the Western Pacific and the South China Sea under Beijing's control.Though he considered himself a ""strongman,"" Rodrigo Duterte, who preceded Marcos as president, had pandered to China and launched joint oil production projects that were ultimately halted by the top Philippine court. By the end of his rule, Duterte had realized that a deeper partnership with China would only be to the detriment of the Philippines and pivoted back to the United States — despite previously publicly toying with the idea of ending the presence of US troops in the country.India, South Korea, Japan, Australia and New Zealand are all reorganizing their alliances with the United States. That means deeper cooperation among security services and increased military spending. This is because democracies across the region are keenly aware that China is making ever-greater demands and could use economic cooperation to extract political concessions.It is against the backdrop of new alliances across Asia in the face of China's imperial aspirations that Xi's statements at the recently concluded National People's Congress should be understood. Speaking at the sham parliament, the president complained that his country had been encircled by the United States and that China's army would therefore need to grow into a wall of steel. His government is misrepresenting the truth, however, as it does so often; no one is interested in invading China. But the reverse may be true: All of the country's neighbors have a real fear that China could invade them.Alexander Görlach is a senior fellow at the Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs and a research associate at the Internet Institute at Oxford University.This article was translated from German.",2023/3/18,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839664,Friday's Sports In Brief,"COLLEGE BASKETBALLCOLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Pulling off one of the biggest upsets in NCAA Tournament history, the undersized, underdog Fairleigh Dickinson stunned top-seeded Purdue 63-58, becoming the second No. 16 seed to win a game in March Madness.The shortest of the 363 Division I teams in the country, the Knights (21-15) showed no fear in swarming 7-foot-4 All-America center Zach Edey from the start and simply outplayed the Big Ten champion Boilermakers (29-6).Sean Moore scored 19 points to lead FDU and a relentless defensive charge — the Knights pressed most of the game — by a team that now has everyone’s attention.Five years ago, UMBC showed the way for the little guys by overwhelming Virginia in the first 16-over-1 victory after numerous close calls over the years. Still, No. 16s had a 1-150 record against No. 1s and were 1-151 overall before FDU’s shocker.The Knights will meet FAU — a 66-65 winner over Memphis — on Sunday for a Sweet 16 berth and a trip next week to play at Madison Square Garden in New York.GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) — Jack Nunge blocked Terrell Burden’s driving attempt at a go-ahead layup in the final seconds, and Xavier dug out of a 13-point hole against surprising Kennesaw State to escape with a 72-67 victory in the first round of the NCAA Tournament.Souley Boum hit four clinching free throws in the final 2.6 seconds for the third-seeded Musketeers (26-9), who ran off 15 unanswered points as part of a game-ending 24-6 run. That was enough to turn away the 14th-seeded Owls (26-9) in the program’s first-ever March Madness game.Xavier moves on to face either Pittsburgh on Sunday in the Midwest Region.Kennesaw State made just two baskets in the final 9:57 as its chances of a signature March moment slipped away painfully.COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — Zia Cooke scored 11 points as No. 1 South Carolina moved five wins away from a perfect season after opening the women’s NCAA Tournament with a 72-40 victory over No. 16 seed Norfolk State.Aliyah Boston had seven points, nine rebounds and two blocks for the Gamecocks (33-0), who won their 39th straight game dating back to last year’s NCAA title run and moved to 11-0 in first-round games under coach Dawn Staley. They’ll face No. 8 seed South Florida on Sunday for a spot in the Sweet 16.This was a colossal mismatch from the tip like so many other games South Carolina’s been a part of this season.Norfolk State’s tallest player is freshman forward Skye Robinson at 6-foot-2. South Carolina has seven players that tall or taller.South Carolina did its best to end any drama early as Boston and Cooke scored five points apiece in the opening quarter for a 20-7 lead. The Gamecock starters picked things up in the third quarter scoring the first six points to lead 40-18 and the Spartans could not hope to catch up. The lead swelled to 30 points after three quarters.STANFORD, Calif. (AP) — Haley Jones scored 17 points for a top-seeded Stanford team missing star Cameron Brink because of a stomach bug, and the Cardinal advanced to the second round of the women's NCAA Tournament by beating 16th-seeded Sacred Heart 92-49.Freshman Talana Lepolo dished out seven assists in her NCAA debut as Stanford advances to the second round Sunday against No. 8 seed Mississippi.Stanford, earning a No. 1 seed for a third straight year, notched the program’s 100th NCAA Tournament victory — third most all-time behind Tennessee and UConn. The Cardinal (29-5) have reached the Sweet 16 in 14 consecutive tournaments and haven’t lost in the first two rounds since falling to Florida State at home in 2007.Freshman Ny’Ceara Pryor scored 12 points to lead cold-shooting Sacred Heart (19-14), which overcame a 2-9 start to the season, won its first NCAA Tournament game and kept surprising all the way to March and extended its visit to the Bay Area.NFLFLORHAM PARK, N.J. (AP) — Allen Lazard enjoyed everything about New York when he visited for the first time a few months ago.Now, it will be home for the Jets’ newest wide receiver. And he’ll be reunited with his former offensive coordinator in Nathaniel Hackett— and perhaps soon quarterback Aaron Rodgers.Lazard signed a four-year contract with the Jets on Friday, a deal worth $44 million and includes $22 million guaranteed, according to multiple reports.The Big Apple spotlight might soon shine on Rodgers, Lazard’s former Packers teammate, who said on “The Pat McAfee Show” this week that he intends to play for New York this year after 18 seasons in Green Bay. The sides are still working on compensation details to try to complete a trade.Lazard knows expectations will rise enormously if Rodgers lands with the Jets, a franchise that hasn’t been to the Super Bowl since 1969 and has the NFL’s longest active playoff drought at 12 seasons.PHILADELPHIA (AP) — The Philadelphia Eagles and quarterback Marcus Mariota have agreed on a one-year, $5 million contract, a person with knowledge of the deal told The Associated Press.The person, speaking on condition of anonymity because the team hasn’t announced the deal, said Mariota’s contract is worth up to $8 million, including incentives.Mariota, who was released by Atlanta last month, will be the backup for Jalen Hurts in Philadelphia.Mariota completed 61.3% of his passes last season for 2,219 yards, 15 touchdowns and nine interceptions in 13 starts for the Falcons. He also had a career-high 438 yards rushing and four TDs.NBALOS ANGELES (AP) — Maxi Kleber drilled the winning 3-pointer at the buzzer on a crosscourt pass from Kyrie Irving, who scored 38 points in the Dallas Mavericks’ stunning 111-110 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers.With Luka Doncic sidelined, Kleber did a remarkable imitation of the injured superstar who has repeatedly beaten the Lakers with big shots over the years. The German big man’s teammates piled on him in celebration after he silenced the Lakers’ crowd with his only 3-pointer of the night.Kleber first hit three free throws after Anthony Davis unwisely fouled him on a 3-point attempt, and Davis made just one of two for Los Angeles with 6.7 seconds left after getting fouled on the ensuing inbounds pass. Dallas got the ball to Irving, who drew a double-team and found Kleber for an open 3-pointer released over Davis’ outstretched arm just before the horn.The play also was redemption for Kleber, who threw away an inbounds pass with 1.8 seconds left in regulation against San Antonio on Wednesday night. The Spurs subsequently tied it and went on to win in overtime.Irving scored 13 points in the fourth quarter of his return from a three-game injury absence for the Mavs, who avoided falling into a three-way tie with the Lakers and the Timberwolves in the tight Western Conference standings.Davis had 26 points and 10 rebounds before making a handful of enormous last-minute mistakes for the Lakers, who missed 12 of their 31 free throw attempts and couldn’t make a field goal in the final 3:16. Los Angeles lost for the third time in four games.SAN ANTONIO (AP) — Jaren Jackson Jr. scored 28 points and the Memphis Grizzlies completed the largest comeback in franchise history after trailing by 29 in the third quarter, rallying to beat the San Antonio Spurs 126-120 in overtime.Memphis faced a nine-point deficit in the final minute of regulation before outscoring San Antonio 9-0 to send it to overtime.Desmond Bane added 21 points, including eight points in overtime, and Tyus Jones had his first career triple-double with 20 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists for the Grizzlies.The huge comeback win came as Ja Morant nears his return for Memphis. The All-Star guard missed his seventh game as part of an eight-game suspension for “conduct detrimental to the league.” Memphis improved to 4-3 without Morant.Devin Vassell had 25 points and Zach Collins added 24 for San Antonio, which fell to 0-5 in overtime.GOLFPALM HARBOR, Fla. (AP) — Adam Schenk is playing for the 10th consecutive week on the PGA Tour and finally seeing some good results, making enough putts for a 2-under 69 that gave him a one-shot lead going into the weekend at the Valspar Championship.Schenk had four birdies, all but one of them from inside 10 feet, and finished with a bogey from the bunker short of the 18th on the Copperhead course at Innisbrook. He was at 7-under 135, one shot ahead of Kramer Hickok, who had a 68.Jordan Spieth is a big part of the weekend, wasting a great round of driving with some suspect short irons. He still posted a 70 and was only two shots behind.",2023/3/18,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839667,Bangladesh routs Ireland for record victory in 1st ODI,"SYLHET, Bangladesh (AP) — Shakib Al Hasan’s splendid allround effort helped Bangladesh seal its largest-ever victory when it beat Ireland by 183 runs in the three-match one-day international series opener on Saturday.Shakib hit 93, his third straight half-century, and then added a wicket to contribute in the team’s victory.The talisman also reached the 7,000 runs mark as the second Bangladeshi batter after Tamim Iqbal when he was on 24 and became only the third player in the history with 7,000 runs and 300 wickets simultaneously.Towhid Hridoy played a wonderful 92 on debut as Bangladesh compiled 338-8, its highest-ever ODI score, a total that the Irish couldn't challenge as they were bowled out for 155 in 30.5 overs.Shakib and Hridoy combined for 135 off 125 for the fourth wicket stand to lay a solid platform.Mushfiqur Rahim contributed with a 26 ball-44, hitting three fours and as many sixes.Bangladesh lost its skipper Tamim Iqbal for 3 when he edged pacer Mark Adair at first slip after Ireland sent the hosts in to batting.Liton Das (26) and Najmul Hossain (25) got the start but both of them failed to count it, leaving Bangladesh at 81-3 in 17th over.Hridoy showed a fearless approach as Shakib accumulated runs smartly, mostly relying on singles and doubles.After bringing up his 53rd half-century off 65 balls with a single, Shakib went after pacer Graham Hume, taking 22 runs including five fours.Hume, who claimed his career-best 4-60, took the ultimate revenge, denying Shakib his 10th century. His 89-ball knock included nine boundaries.Hridoy reached his half-century off 55 balls and grew with confidence. He came down heavily on legspinner Gareth Delany to hit him two sixes.Mushfiqur Rahim also joined the party as Bangladesh’s inning got the pace.But Hume came back strongly to deal a double blow in the space of two balls. He claimed Mushfiqur, ending 49 ball-80 runs partnership between him and Hridoy and then rattled the stump of Hridoy as he approached a century on debut.Hridoy missed out the century by eight runs but his 92 off 85 that studded by eight fours and two sixes was a best score by a Bangladeshi batter on debut.Ireland made a confident start with Stephen Doheny and Paul Stirling adding 60 in their opening stand in 11.2 overs.Shakib had Doheny caught by Mushfiqur on 34 to break through.Fast bowler Ebadot Hossain, who returned figures of 4-45 for his career-best effort, got into act by claiming two wickets in his consecutive two overs. He removed Stirling (34) and Harry Tector (3).Fast bowler Taskin Ahmed (2-25) and left-arm spinner Nasum Ahmed (3-43) ripped through Ireland’s middle order before Ebadot came back in his second spell to clean up the tail.Before being the last man out, George Dockrell made team-high 45.The second ODI is on Monday.___More AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/19,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839668,Reports of violence in Nigeria election for new governors,"ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — Millions of Nigerians voted Saturday to elect state governors but faced intimidation and violence in some cities amid heightened tensions following a disputed presidential election in Africa's most populous nation last month.New governors were being chosen for 28 of Nigeria’s 36 states as the political opposition continues to reject the victory of President-elect Bola Tinubu, who belongs to the ruling All Progressives Congress party.By Saturday night, the counting of votes has started in most of the polling units across the country, though the winners in most of the states are not expected to be announced until Monday. Voting was postponed in a few locations, including in a Lagos town, over fear of attacks on electoral officials.The performance of the Independent National Electoral Commission ""has improved considerably compared to the Feb. 25 elections, but violence has been much more intense across the country,” said Idayat Hassan, head of the Center for Democracy and Development, Nigeria’s largest democracy-focused group. The group, which deployed more than 1,200 observers for the election, said violence in the election was more rampant in the southern region.Local observer group YIAGA Africa said it found several instances in which voters were intimidated and prevented from voting unless they agreed to cast their ballots for certain political parties.Among the places it listed was Lagos state, where the president-elect's party is seeking to retain the governor's office. The All Progressives Congress lost the state in last month's presidential and legislative elections.“Security agencies should respond promptly to reports of voter intimidation and attack at polling units to accord citizens the opportunity to exercise their constitutional rights to vote,” Samson Itodo, executive director of YIAGA Africa, said in a statement.Allegations of vote-buying were also rampant. In Enugu, voters were intimidated and lured with as little as 200 naira ($0.43), according to Chidimma Igwe, who voted in the state.“They (party representatives) will follow you right into the ballot box to see who you voted for. If you vote for PDP (one of the political parties), they will give you 200 naira,” Igwe said.Many Nigerians are struggling to survive in the aftermath of an ongoing currency swap program that created a cash shortage.In Delta state, suspected thugs disrupted the voting in Ughelli and damaged election materials, according to resident Apkozie Emmanuel.“Even the police were overwhelmed; they just stood aside,” Emmanuel said.A record 87.2 million people were registered to vote in the election, but observers reported low turnout Saturday, perhaps even lower than in the February elections. The 26.7% voter participation last month was the lowest in Nigerian history.Although Nigeria is Africa’s largest economy and one of its top oil producers, endemic corruption and poor governance have stifled the country's development. The Nigerian Constitution grants enormous powers to state governors, who are immune from prosecution while in office.The prospect of holding the authority accorded governors make many politicians eager to get elected as one, the Center for Democracy and Development's Hassan said.Yet polls have shown that many citizens do not have a high level of interest in the election or the performance of governors, a trend analysts said affects the level of accountability across the states.“Even if we get the president right, everything else is against us — the people in the national assembly, the governors and the structural problems in terms of our constitution,” said Ayisha Osori, a director at Open Society Foundations, a nonprofit organization.Some voters also urged incoming governors to take steps to make life better for many living in poverty and unemployed.In Lagos, trader Monica Obi lamented the high price of food items. “When you go to the market, you cannot buy one cup of rice,"" Obi said. “I have four children. I cannot feed them very well because the price is too much.”___Associated Press journalists Hilary Uguru in Asaba, Nigeria, and Dan Ikpoyi in Lagos, Nigeria, contributed.",2023/3/19,,World

However, because of the high number of bookings around the April 1-5 Tomb Sweeping Holiday period, flights will still be operating on the route on March 30, March 31, and between April 1 and April 9, the Liberty Times reported.StarLux said it had discussed its summer schedule with the aviation authorities for some time, but no agreement had been reached, leaving the airline with no option but to adjust its flight schedule.StarLux apologized to travelers who had already booked tickets, promising it would assist them with alternative arrangements and refunds. Flights between Taiwan and its two other Vietnamese destinations, Hanoi and Da Nang, are not affected by the changes.The airline, which launched services in early 2020 just as the COVID-19 pandemic was expanding, announced it would open an office in Los Angeles, California, and start flights to the city in April.",2023/3/18,2359,Travel & Cuisine
